         The first written records for the history of France appeared in the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age_France| . What is now  |France|France|  made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as  |Gaul|Gaul| . Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the  |Gauls|Gauls| , the  |Aquitani|Aquitani| , and the  |Belgae|Belgae| . The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were  |Celtic|Celts|  people speaking what is known as the  |Gaulish_language|Gaulish_Language| .     Over the course of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and  |Carthaginians|Carthage|  established colonies on the  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean|  coast and the offshore islands. The  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic|  annexed southern Gaul as the  |province|Roman_Province|  of  |Gallia_Narbonensis|Gallia_Narbonensis|  in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman forces under  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  conquered the rest of Gaul in the  |Gallic_Wars|Gallic_Wars|  of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a  |Gallo-Roman_culture|Gallo-Roman_Culture|  emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| .     In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to  |barbarian|Barbarian|  raids and migration, most importantly by the  |Germanic|Germanic_Peoples| |Franks|Franks| . The Frankish king  |Clovis_I|Clovis_I|  united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| . The medieval  |Kingdom_of_France|Kingdom_Of_France|  emerged from the western part of Charlemagnes  |Carolingian_Empire|Carolingian_Empire| , known as  |West_Francia|West_Francia| , and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the  |House_of_Capet|House_Of_Capet| , founded by  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet|  in 987.     A  |succession|Order_Of_Succession|  crisis following the death of the last  |direct_Capetian|Direct_Capetian|  monarch in 1328 led to the series of conflicts known as the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War|  between the  |House_of_Valois|House_Of_Valois|  and the  |House_of_Plantagenet|House_Of_Plantagenet| . The war formally began in 1337 following  |Philip_VIs|Philip_Vi_Of_France|  attempt to seize the  |Duchy_of_Aquitaine|Duchy_Of_Aquitaine|  from its hereditary holder,  |Edward_III_of_England|Edward_Iii_Of_England| , the Plantagenet claimant to the French throne. Despite early Plantagenet victories, including the capture and ransom of  |John_II_of_France|John_Ii_Of_France| , fortunes turned in favor of the Valois later in the war. Among the notable figures of the war was  |Joan_of_Arc|Joan_Of_Arc| , a French peasant girl who led French forces against the English, establishing herself as a national heroine. The war ended with a Valois victory in 1453.     Victory in the Hundred Years War had the effect of strengthening French nationalism and vastly increasing the power and reach of the French monarchy. During the period known as the  Ancien Régime , France transformed into a centralized  |absolute_monarchy|Absolute_Monarchy| . During the next centuries, France experienced the  |Renaissance|French_Renaissance|  and the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| . At the height of the  |French_Wars_of_Religion|French_Wars_Of_Religion| , France became embroiled in another succession crisis, as the last Valois king,  |Henry_III|Henry_Iii_Of_France| , fought against rival factions the  |House_of_Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon|  and the  |House_of_Guise|House_Of_Guise| .  |Henry,_King_of_Navarre|Henry_Iv_Of_France| , scion of the Bourbon family, would be victorious in the conflict and establish the French Bourbon dynasty. A burgeoning worldwide  |colonial_empire|French_Colonial_Empire|  was established in the 16th century. French political power reached a zenith under the rule of  |Louis_XIV|Louis_Xiv_Of_France| , The Sun King , builder of  |Versailles_Palace|Palace_Of_Versailles| .     In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated institutions were overthrown in the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| . The country was governed for a period as a  |Republic|French_First_Republic| , until the  |French_Empire|First_French_Empire|  was declared by  |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon_Bonaparte| . Following Napoleons defeat in the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , France went through several further regime changes, being ruled as a  |monarchy|Bourbon_Restoration| , then briefly as a  |Second_Republic|French_Second_Republic| , and then as a  |Second_Empire|Second_French_Empire| , until a more lasting  |French_Third_Republic|French_Third_Republic|  was established in 1870.     France was one of the  |Triple_Entente|Triple_Entente|  powers in  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , fighting alongside the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Japan, the United States and  |smaller_allies|Allies_Of_World_War_I|  against Germany and the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers| .     France was one of the  |Allied_Powers|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , but was conquered by  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  in 1940. The Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled directly by Germany while the south was controlled until 1942 by the collaborationist  |Vichy_government|Vichy_France| . Living conditions were harsh as Germany drained away food and manpower, and many  |Jews|Jews|  were killed.  |Charles_de_Gaulle|Charles_De_Gaulle|  led the  |Free_France|Free_France|  movement that one-by-one took over the colonial empire, and coordinated the wartime  |Resistance|French_Resistance| . Following  |liberation|Liberation_Of_France|  in summer 1944, a  |Fourth_Republic|French_Fourth_Republic|  was established. France slowly recovered economically, and enjoyed a  |baby_boom|Baby_Boom|  that reversed its very low fertility rate. Long wars in Indochina and Algeria drained French resources and ended in political defeat. In the wake of the  |Algerian_Crisis|May_1958_Crisis|  of 1958, Charles de Gaulle set up the  |French_Fifth_Republic|French_Fifth_Republic| . Into the 1960s  |decolonization|Decolonization|  saw most of the  |French_colonial_empire|French_Colonial_Empire|  become independent, while smaller parts were incorporated into the French state as  |overseas_departments|Overseas_Department|  and  |collectivities|Overseas_Collectivities| . Since World War II France has been a permanent member in the UN Security Council and  |NATO|Nato| . It played a central role in the unification process after 1945 that led to the  |European_Union|European_Union| . Despite slow economic growth in recent years, it remains a  |strong_economic,_cultural,_military_and_political_factor|Great_Power|  in the 21st century.               Stone tools discovered at  |Chilhac|Chilhac|  and  |Lézignan-la-Cèbe|Lézignan-La-Cèbe|  in 2009 indicate that pre-human ancestors may have been present in France at least 1.6 million years ago.       |Neanderthals|Neanderthal|  were present in Europe from about 400,000  |BC|Anno_Domini| ,  but died out about 30,000 years ago, possibly out-competed by the modern humans during a period of cold weather. The earliest modern humans Homo sapiens  |entered_Europe|Early_Human_Migrations|  by 43,000 years ago .  The cave paintings of  |Lascaux|Lascaux|  and Gargas  as well as the  |Carnac_stones|Carnac_Stones|  are remains of the local prehistoric activity. The first written records for the history of France appear in the Iron Age. What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul. Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language.     Over the course of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks, Romans, and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic annexed southern Gaul as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman forces under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the Roman empire.                   In 600 BC,  |Ionia|Ionia| n  |Greeks|Greeks_In_Pre-Roman_Gaul|  from  |Phocaea|Phocaea|  founded the  |colony_of_Massalia|Greek_Colonies|   on the shores of the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea| , making it the oldest city of France.   At the same time, some Celtic tribes penetrated the eastern parts  of the current territory of France, but this occupation spread in the rest of France only between the 5th and 3rd century BC. Carpentier et al. 2000, p.29             Covering large parts of modern-day France, Belgium, northwest Germany and northern Italy, Gaul was inhabited by many  |Celtic|Celts|  and  |Belgae|Belgae|  tribes whom the Romans referred to as  |Gauls|Gauls|  and who spoke the  |Gaulish_language|Gaulish_Language|  roughly between the  |Oise|Oise|  and the  |Garonne|Garonne|  , according to  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| . On the lower Garonne the people spoke  |Aquitanian|Aquitanian_Language| , a  |Pre-Indo-European_language|Pre-Indo-European_Languages|  related to  |Basque|Basque_Language|  whereas a  |Belgian_language|Belgian_Language|  was spoken north of  |Lutecia|Lutecia|  but north of the  |Loire|Loire|  according to other authors like  |Strabo|Strabo| . The Celts founded cities such as  |Lutetia_Parisiorum|Lutetia|  and  |Burdigala|Bordeaux|  while the Aquitanians founded  |Tolosa|Toulouse|  .     Long before any Roman settlements, Greek navigators settled in what would become  |Provence|Provence| .  The  |Phoceans|Phocaea|  founded important cities such as  |Massalia|Marseille|  and  |Nikaia|Nice|  , bringing them into conflict with the neighboring Celts and Ligurians. Some Phocean great navigators, such as  |Pytheas|Pytheas| , were born in Marseille. The Celts themselves often fought with Aquitanians and Germans, and a Gaulish war band led by  |Brennus|Brennus|  invaded Rome c. 393 or 388 BC following the  |Battle_of_the_Allia|Battle_Of_The_Allia| .     However, the tribal society of the Gauls did not change fast enough for the centralized Roman state, who would learn to counter them. The Gaulish tribal confederacies were then defeated by the Romans in battles such as  |Sentinum|Battle_Of_Sentinum|  and  |Telamon|Battle_Of_Telamon|  during the 3rd century BC. In the early 3rd century BC, some Belgae  conquered the surrounding territories of the  |Somme|River_Somme|  in northern Gaul after battles supposedly against the  |Armoricani|Armoricani|  near  |Ribemont-sur-Ancre|Ribemont-Sur-Ancre|  and  |Gournay-sur-Aronde|Gournay-Sur-Aronde| , where sanctuaries were found.     When  |Carthaginian|Carthaginian_Republic|  commander  |Hannibal_Barca|Hannibal|  fought the Romans, he recruited several Gaulish mercenaries who fought on his side at  |Cannae|Battle_Of_Cannae| . It was this Gaulish participation that caused Provence to be annexed in 122 BC by the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic| . Later, the Consul of Gaul —  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  — conquered all of Gaul. Despite Gaulish opposition led by  |Vercingetorix|Vercingetorix| , the Gauls succumbed to the Roman onslaught. The Gauls had some success at first at  |Gergovia|Battle_Of_Gergovia| , but were ultimately defeated at  |Alesia|Battle_Of_Alesia|  in 52 BC. The Romans founded cities such as  |Lugdunum|Lugdunum|  ,  |Narbonensis|Narbonne|  and allow in a correspondence between  |Lucius_Munatius_Plancus|Lucius_Munatius_Plancus|  and  |Cicero|Cicero|  to formalize the existence of  |Cularo|Cularo|  . Ad Familiares, 10, 23              Gaul was divided into several different provinces. The Romans displaced populations to prevent local identities from becoming a threat to Roman control. Thus, many Celts were displaced in  |Aquitania|Gallia_Aquitania|  or were enslaved and moved out of Gaul. There was a strong cultural evolution in Gaul under the Roman Empire, the most obvious one being the replacement of the  |Gaulish_language|Gaulish_Language|  by  |Vulgar_Latin|Vulgar_Latin| . It has been argued the similarities between the Gaulish and  |Latin|Latin|  languages favoured the transition. Gaul remained under Roman control for centuries and Celtic culture was then gradually replaced by  |Gallo-Roman_culture|Gallo-Roman_Culture| .     The Gauls became better integrated with the Empire with the passage of time. For instance, generals  |Marcus_Antonius_Primus|Marcus_Antonius_Primus|  and  |Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola|Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola|  were both born in Gaul, as were emperors  |Claudius|Claudius|  and  |Caracalla|Caracalla| . Emperor  |Antoninus_Pius|Antoninus_Pius|  also came from a Gaulish family. In the decade following  |Valerians|Valerian|  capture by the Persians in 260,  |Postumus|Postumus|  established a short-lived  |Gallic_Empire|Gallic_Empire| , which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the  |Franks|Franks|  and the  |Alamanni|Alamanni| , entered Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor  |Aurelians|Aurelian|  victory at  |Châlons|Battle_Of_Châlons|  in 274.     A migration of Celts appeared in the 4th century in  |Armorica|Armorica| . They were led by the legendary king  |Conan_Meriadoc|Conan_Meriadoc|  and came from Britain. They spoke the now extinct  |British_language|British_Language| , which evolved into the  |Breton|Breton_Language| ,  |Cornish|Cornish_Language| , and  |Welsh_languages|Welsh_Language| .     In 418 the Aquitanian province was given to the  |Goths|Goths|  in exchange for their support against the  |Vandals|Vandals| . Those same Goths had sacked Rome in 410 and established a capital in Toulouse.        The Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and  |Flavius_Aëtius|Flavius_Aëtius|  had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control.   He first used the  |Huns|Huns|  against the  |Burgundians|Burgundians| , and these mercenaries destroyed  |Worms|Worms,_Germany| , killed king  |Gunther|Gunther| , and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by Aëtius near  |Lugdunum|Lugdunum|  in 443. The Huns, united by  |Attila|Attila_The_Hun| , became a greater threat, and Aëtius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the  |Battle_of_Châlons|Battle_Of_Châlons| , in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila.     The Roman Empire was on the verge of collapsing. Aquitania was definitely abandoned to the  |Visigoths|Visigoths| , who would soon conquer a significant part of southern Gaul as well as most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Burgundians claimed their own kingdom, and northern Gaul was practically abandoned to the Franks. Aside from the Germanic peoples, the  |Vascones|Vascones|  entered  |Wasconia|Duchy_Of_Vasconia|  from the Pyrenees and the  |Bretons|Bretons|  formed three kingdoms in Armorica:  |Domnonia|Domnonia| ,  |Cornouaille|Cornouaille|  and  |Broërec|Broërec| . P. J. Heather, The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians                  In 486,  |Clovis_I|Clovis_I| , leader of the  |Salian_Franks|Salian_Franks| , defeated  |Syagrius|Syagrius|  at  |Soissons|Battle_Of_Soissons|  and subsequently united most of northern and central Gaul under his rule. Clovis then recorded a succession of victories against other Germanic tribes such as the  |Alamanni|Alamanni|  at  |Tolbiac|Battle_Of_Tolbiac| . In 496,  |pagan|Pagan|  Clovis adopted  |Catholicism|Catholicism| . This gave him greater legitimacy and power over his Christian subjects and granted him clerical support against the  |Arian|Arian|  Visigoths. He defeated  |Alaric_II|Alaric_Ii|  at  |Vouillé|Battle_Of_Vouillé|  in 507 and annexed Aquitaine, and thus Toulouse, into his Frankish kingdom. Edward James, The Franks     The Goths retired to  |Toledo|Toledo,_Spain|  in what would become Spain. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the  |Merovingian_Dynasty|Merovingian_Dynasty|  but his kingdom would not survive his death in 511. Under Frankish inheritance traditions, all sons inherit part of the land, so four kingdoms emerged: centered on  |Paris|Paris| ,  |Orléans|Orléans| ,  |Soissons|Soissons| , and  |Rheims|Rheims| . Over time, the borders and numbers of Frankish kingdoms were fluid and changed frequently. Also during this time, the  |Mayors_of_the_Palace|Mayor_Of_The_Palace| , originally the chief advisor to the kings, would become the real power in the Frankish lands; the Merovingian kings themselves would be reduced to little more than figureheads.     By this time Muslim invaders had  |conquered_Hispania|Umayyad_Conquest_Of_Hispania|  and were threatening the Frankish kingdoms. Duke  |Odo_the_Great|Odo_The_Great|  defeated a major invading force at  |Toulouse|Battle_Of_Toulouse|  in 721 but failed to repel a raiding party in 732. The mayor of the palace,  |Charles_Martel|Charles_Martel| , defeated that raiding party at the  |Battle_of_Tours|Battle_Of_Tours|  and earned respect and power within the Frankish Kingdom. The assumption of the crown in 751 by  |Pepin_the_Short|Pepin_The_Short|  established the  |Carolingian_dynasty|Carolingian_Dynasty|  as the Kings of the Franks.        Carolingian power reached its fullest extent under Pepins son,  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| . In 771, Charlemagne reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of division, subsequently conquering the  |Lombards|Lombards|  under  |Desiderius|Desiderius|  in what is now northern Italy , incorporating  |Bavaria|History_Of_Bavariabavaria_And_The_Agilolfings_Under_Frankish_Overlordship|  into his realm, defeating the  |Avars|Avars|  of the  |Danubian|Danube|  plain , advancing the frontier with  |Islamic_Spain|Al-Andalus|  as far south as  |Barcelona|Barcelona|  , and subjugating  |Lower_Saxony|Lower_Saxony|  after a prolonged campaign .     In recognition of his successes and his political support for the  |Papacy|Papacy| ,  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne|  was crowned Emperor of the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by  |Pope_Leo_III|Pope_Leo_Iii|  in 800. Charlemagnes son  |Louis_the_Pious|Louis_The_Pious|  kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive Louis Is death. Two of his sons  |Charles_the_Bald|Charles_The_Bald|  and  |Louis_the_German|Louis_The_German|  swore allegiance to each other against their brother  |Lothair_I|Lothair_I|  in the  |Oaths_of_Strasbourg|Oaths_Of_Strasbourg| , and the empire was divided among Louiss three sons . After a last brief reunification , the imperial title ceased to be held in the western realm, which was to form the basis of the future French kingdom. The eastern realm, which would become Germany, elected the Saxon dynasty of  |Henry_the_Fowler|Henry_The_Fowler| . Derek Wilson, Charlemagne     Under the  |Carolingians|Carolingian| , the kingdom was ravaged by  |Viking_raiders|Siege_Of_Paris| . In this struggle some important figures such as  |Count_Odo_of_Paris|Odo,_Count_Of_Paris|  and his brother  |King_Robert|Robert_I_Of_France|  rose to fame and became kings. This emerging dynasty, whose members were called the  |Robertines|Robertian_Dynasty| , were the predecessors of the  |Capetian_Dynasty|Capetian_Dynasty| . Led by  |Rollo|Rollo_Of_Normandy| , some Vikings had settled in Normandy and were granted the land, first as counts and then as dukes, by King  |Charles_the_Simple|Charles_The_Simple| , in order to protect the land from other raiders. The people that emerged from the interactions between the new Viking aristocracy and the already mixed Franks and Gallo-Romans became known as the Normans.          |Capetian_Dynasty|Capetian_Dynasty| |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet| , 940–996    |Robert_the_Pious|Robert_Ii_Of_France| , 996–1027    |Henry_I|Henry_I_Of_France| , 1027–60    |Philip_I|Philip_I_Of_France| , 1060–1108    |Louis_VI_the_Fat|Louis_Vi_Of_France| , 1108–37    |Louis_VII_the_Young|Louis_Vii_Of_France| , 1137–80    |Philip_II_Augustus|Philip_Ii_Of_France| , 1180–1223    |Louis_VIII_the_Lion|Louis_Viii_Of_France| , 1223–26    |Saint_Louis_IX|Louis_Ix_Of_France| , 1226–70    |Philip_III_the_Bold|Philip_Iii_Of_France| , 1270–85    |Philip_IV_the_Fair|Philip_Iv_Of_France| , 1285–1314    |Louis_X_the_Quarreller|Louis_X_Of_France| , 1314–16    |John_I_the_Posthumous|John_I_Of_France| , five days in 1316    |Philip_V_the_Tall|Philip_V_Of_France| , 1316–22    |Charles_IV_the_Fair|Charles_Iv_Of_France| , 1322–28    |House_of_Valois|House_Of_Valois| |Philip_VI_of_Valois|Philip_Vi_Of_France| , 1328–50    |John_II_the_Good|John_Ii_Of_France| , 1350–64    |Charles_V_the_Wise|Charles_V_Of_France| , 1364–80    |Charles_VI_the_Mad|Charles_Vi_Of_France| , 1380–1422   English interlude :    |Henry_V_of_England|Henry_V_Of_England| |Henry_VI_of_England|Henry_Vi_Of_England|  and France    |Charles_VII_the_Well_Served|Charles_Vii_Of_France| , 1422–61         France was a very decentralised state during the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| . The authority of the king was more religious than administrative. The 11th century in France marked the apogee of princely power at the expense of the king when states like  |Normandy|Normandy| ,  |Flanders|Flanders|  or  |Languedoc|Languedoc|  enjoyed a local authority comparable to kingdoms in all but name. The  |Capetians|House_Of_Capet| , as they were descended from the  |Robertians|Robertians| , were formerly powerful princes themselves who had successfully unseated the weak and unfortunate  |Carolingian|Carolingian|  kings. Georges Duby, France in the Middle Ages 987–1460: From Hugh Capet to Joan of Arc ,     The  |Carolingian|Carolingian|  kings had nothing more than a royal title when the  |Capetian|House_Of_Capet|  kings added their principality to that title. The Capetians, in a way, held a dual status of King and Prince; as king they held the  |Crown_of_Charlemagne|Crown_Of_Charlemagne|  and as  |Count_of_Paris|Count_Of_Paris|  they held their personal fiefdom, best known as  |Île-de-France|Île-De-France| .     The fact that the Capetians held lands as both Prince and King gave them a complicated status. They were involved in the struggle for power within France as princes, but they also had a religious authority over  |Roman_Catholicism_in_France|Roman_Catholicism_In_France|  as King. The Capetian kings treated other princes more as enemies and allies than as subordinates: their royal title was recognised yet frequently disrespected. Capetian authority was so weak in some remote places that bandits were the effective power.     Some of the kings vassals would grow sufficiently powerful that they would become some of the strongest rulers of western Europe. The  |Normans|Normans| , the  |Plantagenets|Plantagenets| , the  |Lusignans|Lusignans| , the  |Hautevilles|Hautevilles| , the  |Ramnulfids|Ramnulfids| , and the House of  |Toulouse|Counts_Of_Toulouse|  successfully carved lands outside France for themselves. The most important of these conquests for French history was the  |Norman_Conquest_of_England|Norman_Conquest_Of_England|  by  |William_the_Conqueror|William_I_Of_England| , following the  |Battle_of_Hastings|Battle_Of_Hastings|  and immortalised in the  |Bayeux_Tapestry|Bayeux_Tapestry| , because it linked England to France through Normandy. Although the Normans were now both vassals of the French kings and their equals as kings of England, their zone of political activity remained centered in France. David Carpenter The Struggle for Mastery. The Penguin history of Britain 1066–1284 p. 91: In the first place, after 1072 William was largely an absentee. Of the 170 months remaining of his reign he spent around 130 in France, returning to England only on four occasions. This was no passing phase. Absentee kings continued to spend at best half their time in England until the loss of Normandy in 1204... But this absenteeism solidified rather than sapped royal government since it engendered structures both to maintain peace and extract money on the kings absence, money which was above all needed across the channel .     An important part of the French aristocracy also involved itself in the crusades, and French knights founded and ruled the  |Crusader_states|Crusader_States| . An example of the legacy left in the Middle East by these nobles is the  |Krak_des_Chevaliers|Krak_Des_Chevaliers|  enlargement by the Counts of  |Tripoli|Tripoli|  and  |Toulouse|Toulouse| .       The monarchy overcame the powerful barons over ensuing centuries, and established absolute sovereignty over France in the 16th century. A number of factors contributed to the rise of the French monarchy. The dynasty established by Hugh Capet continued uninterrupted until 1328, and the laws of  |primogeniture|Primogeniture|  ensured orderly successions of power. Secondly, the successors of Capet came to be recognised as members of an illustrious and ancient royal house and therefore socially superior to their politically and economically superior rivals. Thirdly, the Capetians had the support of the  |Church|Papacy,_History| , which favoured a strong central government in France. This alliance with the Church was one of the great enduring legacies of the Capetians. The  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade|  was composed almost entirely of Frankish Princes. As time went on, the power of the King was expanded by conquests, seizures and successful feudal political battles.     The history of France starts with the election of  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet|  by an assembly summoned in  |Reims|Reims|  in 987. Capet had been Duke of the Franks and then became King of the Franks . Hughs lands extended little beyond the Paris basin; his political unimportance weighed against the powerful barons who elected him. Many of the kings vassals ruled over territories far greater than his own.  He was recorded to be recognised king by the  |Gauls|Gauls| ,  |Bretons|Bretons| ,  |Danes|Danes| ,  |Aquitanians|Aquitanians| ,  |Goths|Goths| , Spanish and  |Gascons|Gascons| . William W. Kibler, ed. Medieval France: An Encyclopedia      |Count_Borell_of_Barcelona|Borrell_Ii,_Count_Of_Barcelona|  called for Hughs help against Islamic raids, but even if Hugh intended to help Borell, he was otherwise occupied in fighting  |Charles_of_Lorraine|Charles,_Duke_Of_Lower_Lorraine| . The loss of other Spanish principalities then followed, as the Spanish marches grew more and more independent. Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king, is not a well documented figure, his greatest achievement being certainly to survive as king and defeating the Carolingian claimant, thus allowing him to establish what would become one of Europes most powerful house of kings.        Hughs son— |Robert_the_Pious|Robert_Ii_Of_France| —was crowned King of the Franks before Capets demise. Hugh Capet decided so in order to have his succession secured. Robert II, as King of the Franks, met  |Emperor_Henry_II|Henry_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 1023 on the borderline. They agreed to end all claims over each others realm, setting a new stage of Capetian and Ottonian relationships. Although a king weak in power, Robert IIs efforts were considerable. His surviving charters imply he relied heavily on the Church to rule France, much like his father did. Although he lived with a mistress— |Bertha_of_Burgundy|Bertha_Of_Burgundy| —and was excommunicated because of this, he was regarded as a model of piety for monks . The reign of Robert II was quite important because it involved the  |Peace_and_Truce_of_God|Peace_And_Truce_Of_God|  and the  |Cluniac_Reforms|Cluniac_Reforms| .        Under  |King_Philip_I|Philip_I_Of_France| , the kingdom enjoyed a modest recovery during his extraordinarily long reign . His reign also saw the launch of the  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade|  to regain the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land| , which heavily involved his family although he personally did not support the expedition.     It is from  |Louis_VI|Louis_Vi_Of_France|  onward that royal authority became more accepted. Louis VI was more a soldier and warmongering king than a scholar. The way the king raised money from his vassals made him quite unpopular; he was described as greedy and ambitious and that is corroborated by records of the time. His regular attacks on his vassals, although damaging the royal image, reinforced the royal power. From 1127 onward Louis had the assistance of a skilled religious statesman,  |Abbot_Suger|Abbot_Suger| . The abbot was the son of a minor family of knights, but his political advice was extremely valuable to the king. Louis VI successfully defeated, both military and politically, many of the  |robber_barons|Robber_Baron| . Louis VI frequently summoned his vassals to the court, and those who did not show up often had their land possessions confiscated and military campaigns mounted against them. This drastic policy clearly imposed some royal authority on Paris and its surrounding areas. When Louis VI died in 1137, much progress had been made towards strengthening Capetian authority.     Thanks to Abbot Sugers political advice,  |King_Louis_VII|Louis_Vii_Of_France|  enjoyed greater  |moral_authority|Moral_Authority|  over France than his predecessors. Powerful vassals paid homage to the French king. Capetian France 937–1328 p. 64: Then, in 1151, Henry Plantagenet paid homage for the duchy to Louis VII in Paris, homage he repeated as king of England in 1156. Abbot Suger arranged the 1137 marriage between Louis VII and  |Eleanor_of_Aquitaine|Eleanor_Of_Aquitaine|  in Bordeaux, which made Louis VII Duke of Aquitaine and gave him considerable power. However, the couple disagreed over the burning of more than a thousand people in  |Vitry|Vitry-En-Perthois|  during the conflict against the Count of Champagne. Paul Frankl, Gothic Architecture     King Louis VII was deeply horrified by the event and sought penitence by going to the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land| . He later involved the Kingdom of France in the  |Second_Crusade|Second_Crusade|  but his relationship with Eleanor did not improve. The marriage was ultimately annulled by the pope and Eleanor soon married the Duke of Normandy  |Henry_Fitzempress|Henry_Ii_Of_England| , who would become King of England as Henry II two years later. Louis VII was once a very powerful monarch and was now facing a much stronger vassal, who was his equal as King of England and his strongest prince as Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine.     Abbot Sugers vision of construction became what is now known as  |Gothic_architecture|Gothic_Architecture| . This style became standard for most European cathedrals built in the  |late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages| .       The late direct Capetian kings were considerably more powerful and influential than the earliest ones. While Philip I could hardly control his Parisian barons, Philip IV could dictate popes and emperors. The late Capetians, although they often ruled for a shorter time than their earlier peers, were often much more influential. This period also saw the rise of a complex system of international alliances and conflicts opposing, through dynasties, Kings of France and England and Holy Roman Emperor.       The reign of  |Philip_II_Augustus|Philip_Ii_Of_France|  marked an important step in the history of French monarchy. His reign saw the French royal domain and influence greatly expanded. He set the context for the rise of power to much more powerful monarchs like Saint Louis and Philip the Fair.        Philip II spent an important part of his reign fighting the so-called  |Angevin_Empire|Angevin_Empire| , which was probably the greatest threat to the King of France since the rise of the Capetian dynasty. During the first part of his reign Philip II tried using Henry II of Englands son against him. He allied himself with the Duke of Aquitaine and son of Henry II— |Richard_Lionheart|Richard_I_Of_England| —and together they launched a decisive attack on Henrys castle and home of  |Chinon|Chinon|  and removed him from power.     Richard replaced his father as King of England afterward. The two kings then went crusading during the  |Third_Crusade|Third_Crusade| ; however, their alliance and friendship broke down during the crusade. The two men were once again at odds and fought each other in France until Richard was on the verge of totally defeating Philip II.     Adding to their battles in France, the Kings of France and England were trying to install their respective allies at the head of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . If Philip II Augustus supported  |Philip_of_Swabia|Philip_Of_Swabia| , member of the  |House_of_Hohenstaufen|House_Of_Hohenstaufen| , then Richard Lionheart supported  |Otto_IV|Otto_Iv,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , member of the  |House_of_Welf|House_Of_Welf| . Otto IV had the upper hand and became the Holy Roman Emperor at the expense of Philip of Swabia. The crown of France was saved by Richards demise after a wound he received fighting his own vassals in  |Limousin|Limousin| .      |John_Lackland|John_Of_England| , Richards successor, refused to come to the French court for a trial against the  |Lusignans|Lusignan|  and, as Louis VI had done often to his rebellious vassals, Philip II confiscated Johns possessions in France. Johns defeat was swift and his attempts to reconquer his French possession at the decisive  |Battle_of_Bouvines|Battle_Of_Bouvines|  resulted in complete failure. Philip II had annexed Normandy and Anjou, plus capturing the Counts of Boulogne and Flanders, although Aquitaine and Gascony remained loyal to the Plantagenet King. In an additional aftermath of the  |Battle_of_Bouvines|Battle_Of_Bouvines| , Johns ally Holy Roman Emperor  |Otto_IV|Otto_Iv|  was overthrown by  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , member of the House of Hohenstaufen and ally of Philip. Philip II of France was crucial in ordering Western European politics in both England and France.     Philip Augustus founded  |the_Sorbonne|La_Sorbonne|  and made Paris a city for scholars.      |Prince_Louis|Louis_Viii_Of_France|  was involved in the subsequent  |English_civil_war|First_Barons_War|  as French and English aristocracies were once one and were now split between allegiances. While the French kings were struggling against the Plantagenets, the Church called for the  |Albigensian_Crusade|Albigensian_Crusade| . Southern France was then largely absorbed in the royal domains.       France became a truly centralised kingdom under  |Louis_IX|Louis_Ix_Of_France|  . Saint Louis has often been portrayed as a one-dimensional character, a flawless example of the faith and an administrative reformer who cared for the governed ones. However, his reign was far from perfect for everyone: he made unsuccessful crusades, his expanding administrations raised opposition, and he burned Jewish books at the Popes urging.  His judgments were not often practical, although they seemed fair by the standards of the time. It appears Louis had a strong sense of justice and always wanted to judge people himself before applying any sentence. This was said about Louis and French clergy asking for excommunications of Louis vassals: Capetian France p. 265.          Louis IX was only twelve years old when he became King of France. His mother —  |Blanche_of_Castile|Blanche_Of_Castile|  — was the effective power as  |regent|Regent|  . Blanches authority was strongly opposed by the French barons yet she maintained her position until Louis was old enough to rule by himself.     In 1229 the King had to struggle with a long lasting  |strike_at_the_University_of_Paris|University_Of_Paris_Strike_Of_1229| . The  |Quartier_Latin|Latin_Quarter|  was strongly hit by these strikes.     The kingdom was vulnerable: war was still going on in the County of Toulouse, and the royal army was occupied fighting resistance in Languedoc.  |Count_Raymond_VII_of_Toulouse|Raymond_Vii_Of_Toulouse|  finally signed the  |Treaty_of_Paris|Treaty_Of_Paris|  in 1229, in which he retained much of his lands for life, but his daughter, married to  |Count_Alfonso_of_Poitou|Alfonso,_Count_Of_Poitou| , produced him no heir and so the County of Toulouse went to the King of France.      |King_Henry_III_of_England|Henry_Iii_Of_England|  had not yet recognized the Capetian overlordship over Aquitaine and still hoped to recover Normandy and Anjou and reform the Angevin Empire. He landed in 1230 at  |Saint-Malo|Saint-Malo|  with a massive force. Henry IIIs allies in Brittany and Normandy fell down because they did not dare fight their king, who led the counterstrike himself. This evolved into the  |Saintonge_War|Saintonge_War|  .     Ultimately, Henry III was defeated and had to recognise Louis IXs overlordship, although the King of France did not seize Aquitaine from Henry III. Louis IX was now the most important landowner of France, adding to his royal title. There were some opposition to his rule in Normandy, yet it proved remarkably easy to rule, especially compared to the County of Toulouse which had been brutally conquered. The  |Conseil_du_Roi|Conseil_Du_Roi| , which would evolve into the  |Parlement|Parlement| , was founded in these times. After his conflict with  |King_Henry_III_of_England|Henry_Iii_Of_England| , Louis established a cordial relation with the Plantagenet King. Capetian France p. 264.     Saint Louis also supported new forms of art such as  |Gothic_architecture|Gothic_Architecture| ; his  |Sainte-Chapelle|Sainte-Chapelle|  became a very famous gothic building, and he is also credited for the  |Morgan_Bible|Morgan_Bible| . The Kingdom was involved in two crusades under Saint Louis: the  |Seventh_Crusade|Seventh_Crusade|  and the  |Eighth_Crusade|Eighth_Crusade| . Both proved to be complete failures for the French King.        |Philip_III|Philip_Iii_Of_France|  became king when Saint Louis died in 1270 during the Eighth Crusade. Philip III was called the Bold on the basis of his abilities in combat and on horseback, and not because of his character or ruling abilities. Philip III took part in another crusading disaster: the  |Aragonese_Crusade|Aragonese_Crusade| , which cost him his life in 1285.     More administrative reforms were made by  |Philip_IV|Philip_Iv_Of_France| , also called Philip the Fair . This king was responsible for the end of the  |Knights_Templar|Knights_Templar| , signed the  |Auld_Alliance|Auld_Alliance| , and established the  |Parlement_of_Paris|Parlement| . Philip IV was so powerful that he could name popes and emperors, unlike the early Capetians. The papacy was moved to  |Avignon|Avignon_Papacy|  and all the contemporary popes were French, such as Philip IVs puppet  |Bertrand_de_Goth,_Pope_Clement_V|Pope_Clement_V| .          The tensions between the Houses of  |Plantagenet|Plantagenet|  and  |Capet|Capetian_Dynasty|  climaxed during the so-called  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War|  when the Plantagenets claimed the throne of France from the Valois. This was also the time of the  |Black_Death|Black_Death| , as well as several civil wars. The French population suffered much from these wars. In 1420 by the  |Treaty_of_Troyes|Treaty_Of_Troyes| |Henry_V|Henry_V_Of_England|  was made heir to Charles VI. Henry V failed to outlive Charles so it was Henry VI of England and France who consolidated the Dual-Monarchy of England and France.     It has been argued that the difficult conditions the French population suffered during the Hundred Years War awakened French nationalism, a nationalism represented by  |Joan_of_Arc|Joan_Of_Arc|  . Although this is debatable, the Hundred Years War is remembered more as a Franco-English war than as a succession of feudal struggles. During this war, France evolved politically and militarily.     Although a Franco-Scottish army was successful at the  |Battle_of_Baugé|Battle_Of_Baugé|  , the humiliating defeats of  |Poitiers|Battle_Of_Poitiers|  and  |Agincourt|Battle_Of_Agincourt|  forced the French nobility to realise they could not stand just as armoured knights without an organised army.  |Charles_VII|Charles_Vii_Of_France|  established the first French standing army, the  |Compagnies_dordonnance|Compagnies_Dordonnance| , and defeated the Plantagenets once at  |Patay|Battle_Of_Patay|  and again, using cannons, at  |Formigny|Battle_Of_Formigny|  . The  |Battle_of_Castillon|Battle_Of_Castillon|  was the last engagement of this war;  |Calais|Calais|  and the  |Channel_Islands|Channel_Islands|  remained ruled by the Plantagenets.                 The Early Modern period in French history spans the following reigns, from 1461 to the Revolution, breaking in 1789:      |House_of_Valois|House_Of_Valois| |Louis_XI_the_Prudent|Louis_Xi_Of_France| , 1461–83    |Charles_VIII_the_Affable|Charles_Viii_Of_France| , 1483–98    |Louis_XII|Louis_Xii_Of_France| , 1498–1515    |Francis_I|Francis_I_Of_France| , 1515–47    |Henry_II|Henry_Ii_Of_France| , 1547–59    |Francis_II|Francis_Ii_Of_France| , 1559–60    |Charles_IX|Charles_Ix_Of_France| , 1560–74     |Henry_III|Henry_Iii_Of_France| , 1574–89    |House_of_Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon| |Henry_IV_the_Great|Henry_Iv_Of_France| , 1589–1610   the Regency of  |Marie_de_Medici|Marie_De_Medici| , 1610–17    |Louis_XIII_the_Just|Louis_Xiii_Of_France|  and his minister  |Cardinal_Richelieu|Cardinal_Richelieu| , 1610–43   the Regency of  |Anne_of_Austria|Anne_Of_Austria|  and her minister  |Cardinal_Mazarin|Cardinal_Mazarin| , 1643–51    |Louis_XIV_the_Sun_King|Louis_Xiv_Of_France|  and his minister  |Jean-Baptiste_Colbert|Jean-Baptiste_Colbert| , 1643–1715   the  |Régence|Régence| , a period of regency under  |Philip_II_of_Orléans|Philip_Ii,_Duke_Of_Orléans| , 1715–23    |Louis_XV_the_Beloved|Louis_Xv_Of_France|  and his minister Cardinal  |André-Hercule_de_Fleury|André-Hercule_De_Fleury| , 1715–74    |Louis_XVI|Louis_Xvi_Of_France| , 1774–92              France in the  |Ancien_Régime|Ancien_Régime|  covered a territory of around . This land supported 13 million people in 1484 and 20 million people in 1700. France had the second largest population in Europe around 1700. Britain had 5 or 6 million, Spain had 8 million, and the Austrian Habsburgs had around 8 million. Russia was the most populated European country at the time. Frances lead slowly faded after 1700, as other countries grew faster.  |Pierre_Goubert|Pierre_Goubert| , The Ancien Régime pp. 2–9.     The sense of being French was uncommon in 1500, as people clung to their local identities. By 1600, however, people were starting to call themselves bon françois.       Political power was widely dispersed. The law courts were powerful, especially that of France. However, the king had only about 10,000 officials in royal service — very few indeed for such a large country, and with very slow internal communications over an inadequate road system. Travel was usually faster by ocean ship or river boat. The different  |estates_of_the_realm|Estates_Of_The_Realm|  the clergy, the nobility, and commoners occasionally met together in the  |Estates_General|Estates_General|  , but in practice the Estates General had no power, for it could petition the king but could not pass laws.     The Catholic Church controlled about 40% of the wealth, tied up in long-term endowments that could be added to but not reduced. The king nominated bishops, but typically had to negotiate with noble families that had close ties to local monasteries and church establishments.     The nobility came second in terms of wealth, but there was no unity. Each noble had his own lands, his own network of regional connections, and his own military force. Frederick J. Baumgartner, France in the Sixteenth Century pp. 4–7     The cities had a quasi-independent status, and were largely controlled by the leading merchants and guilds. Paris was by far the largest city with 220,000 people in 1547 and a history of steady growth. Lyon and Rouen each had about 40,000 population, but Lyon had a powerful banking community and a vibrant culture. Bordeaux was next with only 20,000 population in 1500.     Peasants made up the vast majority of population, who in many cases had well-established rights that the authorities had to respect. In 1484, about 97% of Frances 13 million people lived in rural villages; in 1700, at least 80% of the 20 million people population were peasants.     In the 17th century peasants had ties to the market economy, provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village . Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The stable core of French society, town guildspeople and village labourers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. James B. Collins, Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-modern France. Journal of Social History 1991 24: 563–577.  Fulltext:  |Ebsco|Ebsco| . For the Annales interpretation see Pierre Goubert, The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century      Accepting the existence of these two societies, the constant tension between them, and extensive geographic and social mobility tied to a market economy holds the key to a clearer understanding of the evolution of the social structure, economy, and even political system of early modern France. Collins argues that the  |Annales_School|Annales_School|  paradigm underestimated the role of the market economy; failed to explain the nature of capital investment in the rural economy; and grossly exaggerated social stability. James B. Collins, Geographic and Social Mobility in Early-Modern France, Journal of Social History 243 pp. 563–577  For the Annales interpretation see Pierre Goubert, The French Peasantry in the Seventeenth Century           Although most peasants in France spoke local dialects, an official language emerged in Paris and the French language became the preferred language of Europes aristocracy. Holy Roman Emperor  |Charles_V|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  quipped, I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.      Because of its international status, there was a desire to regulate the French language. Several reforms of the French language worked to make it more uniform. The Renaissance writer  |François_Rabelais|François_Rabelais|  helped to shape French as a literary language, Rabelais French is characterised by the re-introduction of Greek and Latin words.  |Jacques_Peletier_du_Mans|Jacques_Peletier_Du_Mans|  was one of the scholars who reformed the French language. He improved  |Nicolas_Chuquets|Nicolas_Chuquet| |long_scale|Long_And_Short_Scales|  system by adding names for intermediate numbers .          With the death in 1477 of  |Charles_the_Bold|Charles_The_Bold| , France and the Habsburgs began a long process of dividing his rich Burgundian lands, leading to numerous wars. In 1532, Brittany was  |incorporated|Union_Between_Brittany_And_France|  into the Kingdom of France.     France engaged in the long  |Italian_Wars|Italian_Wars|  , which marked the beginning of early modern France.  |Francis_I|Francis_I_Of_France|  faced powerful foes, and he was captured at  |Pavia|Battle_Of_Pavia| . The French monarchy then sought for allies and found one in the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| . The  |Ottoman_Admiral_Barbarossa|Barbarossa|  captured Nice in 1543 and handed it down to Francis I.     During the 16th century, the Spanish and Austrian  |Habsburgs|Habsburgs|  were the dominant power in Europe. The many domains of  |Charles_V|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  encircled France. The  |Spanish_Tercio|Tercio|  was used with great success against French knights. Finally, on 7 January 1558, the  |Duke_of_Guise|Francis,_Duke_Of_Guise|  seized Calais from the English.       Economic historians call the era from about 1475 to 1630 the beautiful 16th century because of the return of peace, prosperity and optimism across the nation, and the steady growth of population.  |Paris|Paris| , for example, flourished as never before, as its population rose to 200,000 by 1550. In  |Toulouse|Toulouse|  the  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  of the 16th century brought wealth that transformed the architecture of the town, such as building of the great aristocratic houses. Pierre Goubert, The Course of French History pp. 127–34             The  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , inspired in France mainly by  |John_Calvin|John_Calvin| , began to challenge the legitimacy and rituals of the Catholic Church. It reached an elite audience.      Calvin, based securely in Geneva Switzerland, was a Frenchman deeply committed to reforming his homeland. The Protestant movement had been energetic, but lacked central organizational direction. With financial support from the church in Geneva, Calvin turned his enormous energies toward uplifting the French Protestant cause. As one historian explains:   :He supplied the dogma, the liturgy, and the moral ideas of the new religion, and he also created ecclesiastical, political, and social institutions in harmony with it. A born leader, he followed up his work with personal appeals. His vast correspondence with French Protestants shows not only much zeal but infinite pains and considerable tact and driving home the lessons of his printed treatises.      Between 1555 and 1562, more than 100 ministers were sent to France. Nevertheless, French King  |Henry_II|Henry_Ii_Of_France|  severely persecuted Protestants under the  |Edict_of_Chateaubriand|Edict_Of_Chateaubriand|  and when the French authorities complained about the missionary activities, the city fathers of Geneva disclaimed official responsibility. T.H.L. Parker, John Calvin: A Biography pp. 161–64. The two main Calvinist strongholds were southwest France and Normandy, but even in these districts the Catholics were a majority. Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful  |Francis,_Duke_of_Guise|Francis,_Duke_Of_Guise|  led to a massacre of Huguenots at  |Vassy|Wassy|  in 1562, starting the first of the  |French_Wars_of_Religion|French_Wars_Of_Religion| , during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces.     King  |Henry_II|Henry_Ii_Of_France|  died in 1559 in a jousting tournament; he was succeeded in turn by his three sons, each of which assumed the throne as minors or were weak, ineffectual rulers. In the power vacuum entered Henrys widow,  |Catherine_de_Medici|Catherine_De_Medici| , who became a central figure in the early years of the Wars of Religion. She is often blamed for the  |St._Bartholomews_Day_massacre|St._Bartholomews_Day_Massacre|  of 1572, when thousands of Huguenots were murdered in Paris and the provinces of France.     The Wars of Religion culminated in the  |War_of_the_Three_Henrys|War_Of_The_Three_Henrys|  , at the height of which bodyguards of the King  |Henry_III|Henry_Iii_Of_France|  assassinated  |Henry_de_Guise|Henry_I,_Duke_Of_Guise| , leader of the Spanish-backed  |Catholic_league|Catholic_League| . In revenge, a priest assassinated Henry III. This led to the ascension of the Huguenot  |Henry_IV|Henry_Iv_Of_France| ; in order to bring peace to a country beset by religious and succession wars, he converted to Catholicism. Paris is worth a Mass, he reputedly said. He issued the  |Edict_of_Nantes|Edict_Of_Nantes|  in 1598, which guaranteed religious liberties to the Protestants, thereby effectively ending the civil war.
