Limbaugh distinguishes these women from well-intentioned but misguided people who call themselves feminists. However, term came to be widely used for feminism as a whole.     According to  The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English , Limbaugh used the term to marginalize any feminist as a hardline, uncompromising manhater , and The New York Times has described it as one of favorite epithets for supporters of womens rights .  |Toril_Moi|Toril_Moi|  writes that Limbaughs terminology reflects commonplace ideas that feminists hate men , are dogmatic, inflexible, and intolerant , and constitute an extremist, power-hungry minority .

According to  |Helen_Lewis|Helen_Lewis| , deputy editor of the  New Statesman , the idea of conflating a liberation movement with Nazism is just deeply ignorant. It’s self-undermining, because it’s so over the top.  |Laura_Bates|Laura_Bates| , the founder of the  |Everyday_Sexism_Project|Everyday_Sexism_Project| , has said that It’s a desperate attempt to demonise us, and it’s frustrating, because if it wasn’t such an offensive word, you could actually start to embrace it and own it .     Steinem has suggested a boycott of Limbaugh for his use of the term, stating, Hitler came to power against the strong feminist movement in Germany, padlocked the family planning clinics, and declared abortion a crime against the stateall views that more closely resemble Rush Limbaughs .
