   Marxist film theory is one of the oldest forms of  |film_theory|Film_Theory| .        |Sergei_Eisenstein|Sergei_Eisenstein|  and many other  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| |filmmakers|Filmmaker|  in the 1920s expressed ideas of  |Marxism|Marxism|  through film. In fact, the  |Hegelian_dialectic|Hegelian_Dialectic|  was considered best displayed in  |film_editing|Film_Editing|  through the  |Kuleshov_Experiment|Kuleshov_Experiment|  and the development of  |montage|Soviet_Montage_Theory| .     While this  |structuralist|Structuralism|  approach to Marxism and filmmaking was used, the more vociferous complaint that the Russian filmmakers had was with the  |narrative|Literary_Technique|  structure of the  |cinema_of_the_United_States|Cinema_Of_The_United_States| .     Eisensteins solution was to shun narrative structure by eliminating the individual  |protagonist|Protagonist|  and tell stories where the action is moved by the group and the story is told through a clash of one image against the next so that the audience is never lulled into believing that they are watching something that has not been worked over.

Situationist film makers produced a number of important films, where the only contribution by the situationist film cooperative was the sound-track. In  Can dialectics break bricks?  , a  |Chinese|Media_Of_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China| |Kung_Fu|Kung_Fu|  film was transformed by redubbing into an epistle on  |state_capitalism|State_Capitalism|  and  |Proletarian|Proletarian| |revolution|Revolution| . The intellectual technique of using capitalisms own structures against itself is known as  |détournement|Détournement| .
