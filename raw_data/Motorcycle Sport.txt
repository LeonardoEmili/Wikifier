Track racing is a motorcycle sport where teams or individuals race opponents around an oval track. There are differing variants, with each variant racing on a different surface type.          A road rally is a navigation event on public roads whereby competitors must visit a number of checkpoints in diverse geographical locations while still obeying road traffic laws .          Speedway is a motorcycle sport in which the motorcycles have one gear and no brakes.              Land speed is where a single rider accelerates over a 1 to  long straight track and is timed for top speed through a trap at the end of the run. The rider must exceed the previous top speed record for that class or type of bike for their name to be placed on the record books. See   for an example.            Enduro is not exactly racing, because the main objective is to traverse a series of checkpoints, arriving exactly on time in accordance with your beginning time and the time it is supposed to take to arrive at each checkpoint.

Known in the US as Observed Trials, it is not racing, but a sport nevertheless. Trials is a test of skill on a motorcycle whereby the rider attempts to traverse an observed section without placing a foot on the ground . The winner is the rider with the least penalty points.       Time and observation trials are trials with a time limit. The person who completes the route the quickest sets the standard time and all other competitors must finish within a certain amount of time of the standard time to be counted as a finisher . This is combined with the penalty points accrued from the observed sections to arrive at a winner, who is not alway the quickest rider or the rider who lost the less marks on observation but the rider who balanced these competing demands the best. One of the most famous time and observation trials is the Scott trial held annually in  |North_Yorkshire|North_Yorkshire| .       Indoor trials held in stadiums which by their very nature use man-made artificial sections in contrast to outdoor trials which rely heavily on the natural terrain.            Long Distance Trials in the UK are events for road-registered motorcycles. A course of typically 80 to 120 miles is plotted by the organiser, taking in roads, lanes and Byways Open to All Traffic . The event is not a race and riders are required to follow the course by using a RoadBook compiled by the organiser.

In the United States the completions are usually held on off-road courses, where one competitor at a time attempts to ride up a very steep hill, often 45 degrees or more. In some cases, few riders actually complete the course and results are judged on the distance that they manage to achieve. Of those that do complete the course, the rider to reach the top with the shortest elapsed time wins. The motorcycle of choice in the early decades was the  |Harley_Davidson|Harley_Davidson|  45 cubic inch model due to its high torque at low rpms, similar to farm engines.
