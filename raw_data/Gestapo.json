Describing the activities of the organisation, Göring boasted about the utter ruthlessness required for Germanys recovery, the establishment of concentration camps for that purpose, and even went on to claim that excesses were committed in the beginning, recounting how beatings took place here and there. On 26 April 1933, he reorganised the forces Amt III as the Gestapa , a secret state police intended to serve the Nazi cause. Less than two weeks later in early May 1933, the Gestapo moved into their Berlin headquarters at Prinz-Albrecht-Straße 8.     With its 1936 merging with the Kripo to form sub-units of the Sicherheitspolizei , the Gestapo was classified as a government agency. Himmler by his appointment to Chef der Deutschen Polizei , along with serving as Reichsführer-SS made him independent of Interior Minister Wilhelm Fricks nominal control.     The SiPo was placed under the direct command of Reinhard Heydrich who was already chief of the Nazi Partys intelligence service, the Sicherheitsdienst . The idea was to fully identify and integrate the party agency with the state agency . Most of the SiPo members were encouraged or volunteered to become members of the SS and many held a rank in both organisations. Nevertheless, in practice there was jurisdictional overlap and operational conflict between the SD and Gestapo.        In September 1939, the SiPo together with the SD were merged into the newly created Reichssicherheitshauptamt . Both the Gestapo and Kripo became distinct departments within the RSHA. Although the Sicherheitspolizei was officially disbanded, the term SiPo was figuratively used to describe any RSHA personnel throughout the remainder of the war. In lieu of naming convention changes, the original construct of the SiPo, Gestapo, and Kripo cannot be fully comprehended as discrete entities , since they ultimately formed a conglomerate in which each was wedded to each other and the SS through its Security Service, the SD .     The creation of the RSHA represented the formalisation, at the top level, of the relationship under which the SD served as the intelligence agency for the security police. A similar co-ordination existed in the local offices. Within Germany and areas which were incorporated within the Reich for the purpose of civil administration, local offices of the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD were formally separate. They were subject to co-ordination by inspectors of the security police and SD on the staffs of the local higher SS and police leaders, however, and one of the principal functions of the local SD units was to serve as the intelligence agency for the local Gestapo units. In the occupied territories, the formal relationship between local units of the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD was slightly closer.     The Gestapo became known as RSHA Amt IV with Heinrich Müller as its chief. In January 1943, Himmler appointed Ernst Kaltenbrunner RSHA chief; almost seven months after Heydrich had been assassinated . The specific internal departments of Amt IV were as follows:       Communists   Counter-sabotage   Reactionaries, liberals and opposition   Protective services       Catholicism   Protestantism   Freemasons and other churches   Jewish affairs       Central administrative office of the Gestapo, responsible for card files of all personnel including all officials.   Files, card, indexes, information and administration   Protective custody   Press office   NSDAP matters       Administration for regions outside the Reich.   Protectorate affairs, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, regions of Yugoslavia, Greece   1st Belgrade Special Combat detachment   General Government   Confidential office – hostile foreigners, emigrants   Occupied territories – France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Denmark   Occupied Eastern territories       In the Reich   Policy and economic formation   West   Scandinavia   East   South     In 1941 Referat N, the central command office of the Gestapo was formed. However, these internal departments remained and the Gestapo continued to be a department under the RSHA umbrella. The local offices of the Gestapo, known as Gestapo Leitstellen and Stellen, answered to a local commander known as the Inspekteur der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD who, in turn, was under the dual command of Referat N of the Gestapo and also his local SS and Police Leader .     The Gestapo also maintained offices at all Nazi concentration camps, held an office on the staff of the SS and Police Leaders, and supplied personnel as needed to formations such as the ": null

Later also nurses, kindergarten teachers and trained female commercial employees with an aptitude for police work were hired as female detectives after a two-year course After two years as Kriminaloberassistentin promotion to Kriminalsekretärin could take place, after another two or three years in that grade the female detective could be promoted to Kriminalobersekretärin. Further promotions to Kriminalkommissarin and Kriminalrätin was also possible.             thu , German-occupied Czechoslovakia   In 1933, there was no purge of the German police forces. The vast majority of Gestapo officers came from the police forces of the Weimar Republic; members of the SS, the SA, and the NSDAP also joined the Gestapo but were less numerous. By March 1937, the Gestapo employed an estimated 6,500 people in fifty-four regional offices across the Reich. Additional staff were added in March 1938 consequent the annexation of Austria and again in October 1938 with the acquisition of the Sudetenland . In 1939, only 3,000 out of the total of 20,000 Gestapo men held SS ranks, and in most cases, these were honorary. One man who served in the Prussian Gestapo in 1933 recalled that most of his co-workers were by no means Nazis. For the most part they were young professional civil service officers... The Nazis valued police competence more than politics, so in general in 1933, almost all of the men who served in the various state police forces under the Weimar Republic stayed on in their jobs. In Würzburg , which is one of the few places in Germany where most of the Gestapo records survived, every member of the Gestapo was a career policeman or had a police background.     The Canadian historian Robert Gellately wrote that most Gestapo men were not Nazis, but at the same time were not opposed to the Nazi regime, which they were willing to serve, in whatever task they were called upon to perform. Over time, membership in the Gestapo included ideological training, particularly once Werner Best assumed a leading role for training in April 1936. Employing biological metaphors, Best emphasised a doctrine which encouraged members of the Gestapo to view themselves as doctors to the national body in the struggle against pathogens and diseases ; among the implied sicknesses were communists, Freemasons, and the churches—and above and behind all these stood the Jews . Heydrich thought along similar lines and advocated both defensive and offensive measures on the part of the Gestapo, so as to prevent any subversion or destruction of the National Socialist body.     Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends that there was a four-part process in effect which legitimised the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalised violence. Browder also describes a sandwich effect, where from above; Gestapo agents were subjected to ideologically oriented racism and criminal biological theories; and from below, the Gestapo was transformed by SS personnel who did not have the proper police training, which showed in their propensity for unrestrained violence. This admixture certainly shaped the Gestapos public image which they sought to maintain despite their increasing workload; an image which helped them identify and eliminate enemies of the Nazi state.         The Gestapo was a secretive plainclothes agency and agents typically wore civilian suits. There were strict protocols protecting the identity of Gestapo field personnel. When asked for identification, an operative was required only to present his warrant disc. This identified the operative as Gestapo without revealing personal identity and agents, except when ordered to do so by an authorised official, were not required to show picture identification.     Leitstellung staff did wear the grey SS service uniform, but with police-pattern shoulderboards , and SS rank insignia on the left collar patch. The right collar patch was black without the 16px runes. The SD sleeve diamond  insignia was worn on the lower left sleeve, even by SiPo men who were not in the SD.

        " in occupied territories, in this case the Waffen-SS field uniform.       Contrary to popular belief, the Gestapo was not the all-pervasive, omnipotent agency in German society. In Germany proper, many towns and cities had fewer than 50 official Gestapo personnel. For example, in 1939 Stettin and Frankfurt am Main only had a total of 41 Gestapo men combined. In Düsseldorf , the local Gestapo office of only 281 men were responsible for the entire Lower Rhine region, which comprised 4 million people. V-men , as undercover Gestapo agents were known, were used to infiltrate Social Democratic and Communist opposition groups, but this was more the exception, not the rule. The Gestapo office in Saarbrücken had 50 full-term informers in 1939. The District Office in Nuremberg , which had the responsibility for all of northern Bavaria , employed a total of 80–100 full-term informers between 1943 and 1945. The majority of Gestapo informers were not full-term informers working undercover, but were rather ordinary citizens who chose to denounce other people to the Gestapo.     According to Canadian historian Robert Gellately s analysis of the local offices established, the Gestapo was—for the most part—made up of bureaucrats and clerical workers who depended upon denunciations by citizens for their information. Gellately argued that it was because of the widespread willingness of Germans to inform on each other to the Gestapo that Germany between 1933 and 1945 was a prime example of panopticism . The Gestapo—at times—was overwhelmed with denunciations and most of its time was spent sorting out the credible from the less credible denunciations. Many of the local offices were understaffed and overworked, struggling with the paper load caused by so many denunciations. Gellately has also suggested that the Gestapo was a reactive organisation ...  which was constructed within German society and whose functioning was structurally dependent on the continuing co-operation of German citizens .     After 1939, when many Gestapo personnel were called up for war-related work such as service with the ": null

        ", the level of overwork and understaffing at the local offices increased. For information about what was happening in German society, the Gestapo continued to be mostly dependent upon denunciations. 80% of all Gestapo investigations were started in response to information provided by denunciations by ordinary Germans; while 10% were started in response to information provided by other branches of the German government and another 10% started in response to information that the Gestapo itself unearthed. The information supplied by denunciations often led the Gestapo in determining who was arrested.     The popular picture of the Gestapo with its spies everywhere terrorising German society has been rejected by many historians as a myth invented after the war as a cover for German societys widespread complicity in allowing the Gestapo to work. Work done by social historians such as Detlev Peukert , Robert Gellately, Reinhard Mann , Inge Marssolek , René Otto , Klaus-Michael Mallamann and Paul Gerhard , which by focusing on what the local offices were doing has shown the Gestapos almost total dependence on denunciations from ordinary Germans, and very much discredited the older Big Brother picture with the Gestapo having its eyes and ears everywhere. For example, of the 84 cases in Würzburg of ": null

        " , 45 were started in response to denunciations by ordinary people, two by information provided by other branches of the government, 20 via information gained during interrogations of people relating to other matters, four from information from NSDAP organisations, two during political evaluations and 11 have no source listed while none were started by Gestapos own observations of the people of Würzburg.     An examination of 213 denunciations in Düsseldorf showed that 37% were motivated by personal conflicts, no motive could be established in 39%, and 24% were motivated by support for the Nazi regime. The Gestapo always showed a special interest in denunciations concerning sexual matters, especially cases concerning Rassenschande with Jews or between Germans and foreigners, in particular Polish slave workers ; the Gestapo applied even harsher methods to the foreign workers in the country, especially those from Poland, Jews, Catholics and homosexuals . As time went by, anonymous denunciations to the Gestapo caused trouble to various NSDAP officials, who often found themselves being investigated by the Gestapo.     Of the political cases, 61 people were investigated for suspicion of belonging to the KPD, 44 for the SPD and 69 for other political parties. Most of the political investigations took place between 1933 and 1935 with the all-time high of 57 cases in 1935. After that year, political investigations declined with only 18 investigations in 1938, 13 in 1939, two in 1941, seven in 1942, four in 1943 and one in 1944. The other category associated with non-conformity included everything from a man who drew a caricature of Hitler to a Catholic teacher suspected of being lukewarm about teaching National Socialism in his classroom. The administrative control category concerned whose were breaking the law concerning residency in the city. The conventional criminality category concerned economic crimes such as money laundering , smuggling and homosexuality.     Normal methods of investigation included various forms of blackmail , threats and extortion to secure confessions . Beyond that, sleep deprivation and various forms of harassment were used as investigative methods. Failing that, torture and planting evidence were common methods of resolving a case, especially if the case concerned someone Jewish. Brutality on the part of interrogators—often prompted by denunciations and followed with roundups —enabled the Gestapo to uncover numerous resistance networks; it also made them seem like they knew everything and could do anything they wanted.     While the total numbers of Gestapo officials was limited when contrasted against the represented populations, the average Volksgenosse was typically not under observation, so the statistical ratio between Gestapo officials and inhabitants is largely worthless and of little significance according to some recent scholars. As historian Eric Johnson remarked, The Nazi terror was selective terror , with its focus upon political opponents, ideological dissenters , career criminals, the Sinti and Roma population, handicapped persons , homosexuals and above all, upon the Jews. Selective terror by the Gestapo, as mentioned by Johnson, is also supported by historian Richard Evans who states that, Violence and intimidation rarely touched the lives of most ordinary Germans. Denunciation was the exception, not the rule, as far as the behaviour of the vast majority of Germans was concerned. The involvement of ordinary Germans in denunciations also needs to be put into perspective so as not to exonerate the Gestapo. As Evans makes clear, ...it was not the ordinary German people who engaged in surveillance , it was the Gestapo; nothing happened until the Gestapo received a denunciation, and it was the Gestapos active pursuit of deviance and dissent that was the only thing that gave denunciations meaning. The Gestapos effectiveness remained in the ability to project omnipotence...they co-opted the assistance of the German population by using denunciations to their advantage; proving in the end a powerful, ruthless and effective organ of terror under the Nazi regime that was seemingly everywhere. Lastly, the Gestapos effectiveness, while aided by denunciations and the watchful eye of ordinary Germans, was more the result of the co-ordination and co-operation amid the various police organs within Germany, the assistance of the SS, and the support provided by the various Nazi Party organisations; all of them together forming an organised persecution network.         thu , Belgium, are herded together in a cell at the Citadel of Liège , October 1944     Between 14 November 1945 and 3 October 1946, the Allies established an International Military Tribunal to try 22 major Nazi war criminals and six groups for crimes against peace , war crime s and crimes against humanity . Nineteen of the 22 were convicted, and twelve—Martin Bormann , Hans Frank, Wilhelm Frick, Hermann Göring, Alfred Jodl, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Wilhelm Keitel, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Fritz Sauckel, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Julius Streicher—were given the death penalty. Three—Walther Funk, Rudolf Hess, Erich Raeder—received life terms; and the remaining four—Karl Dönitz, Konstantin von Neurath, Albert Speer, and Baldur von Schirach—received shorter prison sentences. Three others—Hans Fritzsche, Hjalmar Schacht, and Franz von Papen—were acquitted. At that time, the Gestapo was condemned as a criminal organisation, along with the SS. However, Gestapo leader Heinrich Müller was never tried, as he disappeared at the end of the war.     Leaders, organisers, investigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit the crimes specified were declared responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan. The official positions of defendants as heads of state or holders of high government offices were not to free them from responsibility or mitigate their punishment; nor was the fact that a defendant acted pursuant to an order of a superior to excuse him from responsibility, although it might be considered by the IMT in mitigation of punishment.     At the trial of any individual member of any group or organisation, the IMT was authorised to declare that the group or organisation to which he belonged was a criminal organisation. When a group or organisation was thus declared criminal, the competent national authority of any signatory had the right to bring persons to trial for membership in that organisation, with the criminal nature of the group or organisation assumed proved.
