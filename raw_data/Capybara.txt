           The capybara  also called the water hog, is a mammal native to  |South_America|South_America| . It is the largest living  |rodent|Rodent|  in the world. Also called chigüire, chigüiro and carpincho, it is a member of the genus  Hydrochoerus , of which the only other  |extant|Extant_Taxon|  member is the  |lesser_capybara|Lesser_Capybara|  . Its close relatives include  |guinea_pigs|Guinea_Pig|  and  |rock_cavies|Rock_Cavy| , and it is more distantly related to the  |agouti|Agouti| , the  |chinchilla|Chinchilla| , and the  |coypu|Coypu| . The capybara inhabits  |savannas|Savanna|  and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species but it is hunted for its meat and  |hide|Hide|  and also for grease from its thick fatty  |skin|Skin| , which is used in the pharmaceutical trade.  . ARKive.org       Its  |common_name|Common_Name|  is derived from  |Tupi|Tupi_Language|  , a complex agglutination of  +  +  +  , meaning one who eats slender leaves , or grass-eater . Ferreira, A. B. H.  Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa , 2nd ed., Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, p.344 Capybaras were called several times Cuartins in Colombia in 2018: in Eje Cafetero and near Barranquilla where the meat was offered as Cuartin Asado .     The  |scientific_name|Scientific_Name| , both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|    and  .   Hydrochærus Capybara , is here also common.   See it also in        The capybara and the  |lesser_capybara|Lesser_Capybara|  belong to the subfamily  |Hydrochoerinae|Hydrochoerinae|  along with the  |rock_cavies|Kerodon| . The living capybaras and their  |extinct|Extinct|  relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and  Kerodon , the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of  |Caviidae|Caviidae| .     Paleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as  Neochoerus  , but more recently have adopted the classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae.  The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that capybara  |molar|Molar|  teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.   Among fossil species, the name capybara can refer to the many species of Hydrochoerinae that are more closely related to the modern Hydrochoerus than to the cardiomyine rodents like Cardiomys. The fossil genera Cardiatherium, Phugatherium, Hydrochoeropsis, and Neochoerus are all capybaras under that concept.             The capybara has a heavy,  |barrel|Barrel| -shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks  |down_hair|Furdownhair| , and its  |guard_hair|Furguardhair|  differs little from over hair.     Adult capybaras grow to  in length, stand  tall at the  |withers|Withers| , and typically weigh , with an average in the Venezuelan  |llanos|Los_Llanos,_Venezuela|  of .  , Arkive Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are  for a wild female from Brazil and  for a wild male from Uruguay. Also an 81  kg individual was reported in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002.  The  |dental_formula|Dental_Formula|  is . Capybaras have slightly  |webbed|Interdigital_Webbing|  feet and  |vestigial|Vestigiality|  tails. Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet.  Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.     Its  |karyotype|Karyotype|  has  |2n|Diploid|  66 and  |FN|Fundamental_Number|  102.          Capybaras are  |semiaquatic|List_Of_Semiaquatic_Tetrapods|  mammals found throughout almost all countries of South America except  |Chile|Chile| . They live in densely  |forest|Forest| ed areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers,  |swamps|Swamp| , ponds, and  |marsh|Marsh| es, as well as flooded  |savannah|Savannah|  and along rivers in the  |tropical_rainforest|Tropical_Rainforest| . They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time.  Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home  |ranges|Range|  averaging 10 hectares in high-density populations.     Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings are fairly common in  |Florida|Florida| , although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.  In 2011, one specimen was spotted on the  |Central_Coast_of_California|Central_Coast| .           Capybaras are  |herbivores|Herbivore| , grazing mainly on grasses and  |aquatic_plants|Aquatic_Plants| , as well as  |fruit|Fruit|  and tree bark. They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybaras jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are auto |coprophagous|Coprophagous| , meaning they eat their own  |feces|Feces|  as a source of bacterial  |gut_flora|Gut_Flora| , to help  |digest|Digestion|  the  |cellulose|Cellulose|  in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by  |cattle|Cattle| . As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.     Like its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize  |vitamin_C|Vitamin_C| , and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of  |scurvy|Scurvy| .     They can have a  |lifespan|Life_Expectancy|  of 8–10 years, but live less than four years in the wild, because they are a favourite food of  |jaguar|South_American_Jaguar| ,  |puma|South_American_Cougar| ,  |ocelot|Ocelot| ,  |eagle|Eagle| , and  |caiman|Caiman|  . The capybara is also the preferred  |prey|Prey|  of the  |anaconda|Eunectes_Murinus| .            Capybaras are known to be  |gregarious|Gregarious| . While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.     Capybaras have two types of scent glands; a morillo , located on the snout, and anal glands. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morillos and use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent further by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in  |estrus|Estrus| . In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.            When in  |estrus|Estrus| , the females scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.  In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose. During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The lifespan of the capybaras sperm is longer than that of other rodents.      Capybara  |gestation|Gestation|  is 130–150 days, and produces a  |litter|Litter|  of four capybara young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group.  |Alloparenting|Alloparenting|  has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in  |Mato_Grosso|Mato_Grosso| , Brazil.       Though quite  |agile|Agility|  on land, capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade  |predators|Predator| . Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during the day, they  |wallow|Wallowing_In_Animals|  in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around  |midnight|Midnight|  and then continue to graze before  |dawn|Dawn| .               Capybaras are not considered a  |threatened_species|Threatened_Species| ;  their  |population|Population|  is stable throughout most of their South American range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.     Capybaras are hunted for their meat and  |pelts|Pelage|  in some areas, and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for  |livestock|Livestock| . In some areas, they are  |farmed|Farming| , which has the effect of ensuring the  |wetland|Wetland| |habitats|Habitats|  are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.     Capybaras have adapted well to urbanization in South America. They can be found in many areas in  |zoos|Zoo|  and  |parks|Park| , and may live for 12 years in  |captivity|Captivity| . Capybaras are gentle and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their  |ticks|Tick|  can be  |vectors|Vector|  to  |Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever|Rocky_Mountain_Spotted_Fever| .      The  |European_Association_of_Zoos_and_Aquaria|European_Association_Of_Zoos_And_Aquaria|  asked  |Drusillas_Park|Drusillas_Park|  in  |Alfriston|Alfriston| ,  |Sussex|Sussex| ,  |England|England|  to keep the  |studbook|Studbook|  for capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe. The studbook includes information about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, as well as how they are related.      Capybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America. The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas, while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during  |Lent|Lent|  and  |Holy_Week|Holy_Week|  as the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while  |other_meats_are_generally_forbidden|Fasting_And_Abstinence_In_The_Catholic_Church| .     Although it is illegal in some  |states|U.S._State| ,  capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the United States.      The image of a capybara features on the  |2-peso|Uruguayan_Peso|  coin of Uruguay.      In Japan, following the lead of Izu Shaboten Park in 1982,  multiple establishments in Japan that raise capybaras have adopted the practice of having them relax in  |onsen|Onsen| .
