Largonji substitutes  for the consonant or  |consonant_cluster|Consonant_Cluster|  at the beginning of the word, or, if the word begins with an  or a vowel, the second syllable; the initial consonant is then reattached to the end of the word along with a  |suffix|Suffix|  particular to the  |argot|Argot| -ji , -oc , -ic , -uche , -ès , or in the case of louchébem, -em/ème .
