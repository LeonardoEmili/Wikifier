            Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its  |enactment|Enactment|  by an  |actor|Actor|  or actress who adopts a  |character|Character| —in  |theatre|Theatre| ,  |television|Television| ,  |film|Film| ,  |radio|Radio| , or any other medium that makes use of the  |mimetic|Mimesis| |_mode|Mode| .     Acting involves a broad range of skills, including a well-developed  |imagination|Imagination| , emotional facility, physical expressivity,  |vocal_projection|Vocal_Projection| , clarity of  |speech|Speech_Communication| , and the ability to interpret  |drama|Drama| . Acting also demands an ability to employ  |dialects|Dialect| ,  |accents|Accent| ,  |improvisation|Improvisational_Theatre| , observation and emulation,  |mime|Mime_Artist| , and  |stage_combat|Stage_Combat| . Many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for  |camera|Camera| .     Most  |early_sources|History_Of_Theatre|  in the  |West|Western_Culture|  that examine the  |art|Art|  of acting  discuss it as part of  |rhetoric|Rhetoric| . Csapo and Slater ; hypokrisis, which literally means acting, was the word used in discussions of  |rhetoric|Rhetoric| al delivery.                 One of the first known  |actors|Actor|  is believed to have been an  |ancient_Greek|Classical_Greece|  called  |Thespis|Thespis|  of  |Icaria|Icaria| . Writing two centuries after the event,  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  in his  Poetics   suggests that Thespis stepped out of the  |dithyramb|Dithyramb| ic  |chorus|Greek_Chorus|  and addressed it as a separate  |character|Character| . Before Thespis, the chorus  |narrated|Narration|  . When Thespis stepped out from the chorus, he spoke as if he was the character . To distinguish between these different  |modes|Mode|  of storytelling—enactment and narration—Aristotle uses the terms  |mimesis|Mimesis|  and  |diegesis|Diegesis|  . From Thespis name derives the word thespian .          A professional actor is someone who is paid to act. Professional actors sometimes undertake unpaid work for a variety of reasons, including educational purposes or for charity events.  |Amateur_actors|Amateur_Theatre|  are those who do not receive payment for performances.     Not all people working as actors in  |film|Film| ;  |television|Television| ; or  |theatre|Theatre|  are professionally trained.  |Mohanlal|Mohanlal| ;  |Bob_Hoskins|Bob_Hoskins| ; for example, had no formal training before becoming an actor.             Conservatories and  |drama_schools|Drama_School|  typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities mostly offer three- to four-year programs, in which a student is often able to choose to focus on acting, whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of  |theatre|Theatre| . Schools vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the  |system|Stanislavskis_System|  of  |Konstantin_Stanislavski|Konstantin_Stanislavski| , which was developed and popularised in America as  |method_acting|Method_Acting|  by  |Lee_Strasberg|Lee_Strasberg| ,  |Stella_Adler|Stella_Adler| ,  |Sanford_Meisner|Sanford_Meisner| , and others.     Other approaches may include a more physically based orientation, such as that promoted by  |theatre_practitioners|Theatre_Practitioner|  as diverse as  |Anne_Bogart|Anne_Bogart| ,  |Jacques_Lecoq|Jacques_Lecoq| ,  |Jerzy_Grotowski|Jerzy_Grotowski| , or  |Vsevolod_Meyerhold|Vsevolod_Meyerhold| . Classes may also include  |psychotechnique|Psychotechnique| ,  |mask|Mask|  work,  |physical_theatre|Physical_Theatre| ,  |improvisation|Improvisation| , and acting for camera.     Regardless of a schools approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice, and movement. Applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive  |auditions|Audition| . Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply. Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at under-18s are widespread. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre, including scene study.     Increased training and exposure to  |public_speaking|Public_Speaking|  allows humans to maintain calmer and more relaxed  |physiologically|Physiologically| .  By measuring a public speakers  |heart_rate|Heart_Rate|  maybe one of the easiest ways to judge shifts in  |stress|Psychological_Stress|  as the heart rate increases with  |anxiety|Anxiety|  . As actors increase performances, heart rate and other evidence of stress can decrease.  This is very important in training for actors, as adaptive strategies gained from increased exposure to public speaking can regulate implicit and explicit anxiety.  By attending an institution with a specialization in acting, increased opportunity to act will lead to more relaxed physiology and decrease in stress and its effects on the body. These effects can vary from hormonal to cognitive health that can impact quality of life and performance              Some classical forms of acting involve a substantial element of  |improvised|Improvisation|  performance. Most notable is its use by the troupes of the  commedia dellarte , a form of  |mask|Mask| ed comedy that originated in Italy.     Improvisation as an approach to acting formed an important part of the Russian  |theatre_practitioner|Theatre_Practitioner| |Konstantin_Stanislavskis|Konstantin_Stanislavski| |_system|Stanislavskis_System|  of actor training, which he developed from the 1910s onwards. Late in 1910, the playwright  |Maxim_Gorky|Maxim_Gorky|  invited Stanislavski to join him in  |Capri|Capri| , where they discussed training and Stanislavskis emerging grammar of acting. Benedetti and Magarshack . Inspired by a popular theatre performance in  |Naples|Naples|  that utilised the techniques of the commedia dellarte, Gorky suggested that they form a company, modelled on the  |medieval_strolling_players|Medieval_Theatre| , in which a playwright and group of young actors would  |devise|Devised_Theatre|  new plays together by means of improvisation. Benedetti and Magarshack . Stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his First Studio of the  |Moscow_Art_Theatre|Moscow_Art_Theatre| . Benedetti and Magarshack . Stanislavskis use was extended further in the approaches to acting developed by his students,  |Michael_Chekhov|Michael_Chekhov|  and  |Maria_Knebel|Maria_Knebel| .     In the United Kingdom, the use of improvisation was pioneered by  |Joan_Littlewood|Joan_Littlewood|  from the 1930s onwards and, later, by  |Keith_Johnstone|Keith_Johnstone|  and Clive Barker. In the United States, it was promoted by  |Viola_Spolin|Viola_Spolin| , after working with  |Neva_Boyd|Neva_Boyd|  at a Hull House in Chicago, Illinois . Like the British practitioners, Spolin felt that playing games was a useful means of training actors and helped to improve an actors performance. With improvisation, she argued, people may find expressive freedom, since they do not know how an improvised situation will turn out. Improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity, rather than pre-planning a response. A character is created by the actor, often without reference to a dramatic text, and a drama is developed out of the spontaneous interactions with other actors. This approach to creating new drama has been developed most substantially by the British filmmaker  |Mike_Leigh|Mike_Leigh| , in films such as  Secrets & Lies  ,  Vera Drake  ,  Another Year  , and  Mr. Turner  .     Improvisation is also used to cover up if an actor or actress makes a mistake.       Speaking or acting in front of an audience is a stressful situation, which causes an increased heart rate.       In a 2017 study on American university students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors heart rates.  While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the more experienced actors displayed less heart rate variability than the less experienced actors in the same play. The more experienced actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less experienced, more stressed actors. The more experienced an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.          The  |semiotics|Semiotics|  of acting involves a study of the ways in which aspects of a performance come to operate for its audience as  |signs|Sign| . This process largely involves the production of meaning, whereby elements of an actors performance acquire significance, both within the broader context of the dramatic action and in the relations each establishes with the real world.     Following the ideas proposed by the  |Surrealist|Surrealism|  theorist  |Antonin_Artaud|Antonin_Artaud| , however, it may also be possible to understand communication with an audience that occurs beneath significance and meaning . In his  The Theatre and its Double  , Artaud compared this interaction to the way in which a  |snake_charmer|Snake_Charming|  communicates with a snake, a process which he identified as  |mimesis|Mimesis|  —the same term that  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  in his  Poetics  used to describe the  |mode|Mode|  in which  |drama|Drama|  communicates its story, by virtue of its embodiment by the actor enacting it, as distinct from  |diegesis|Diegesis|  , or the way in which a  |narrator|Narration|  may describe it. These vibrations passing from the actor to the audience may not necessarily precipitate into significant elements as such , but rather may operate by means of the circulation of  |affects|Affect|  .     The approach to acting adopted by other  |theatre_practitioners|Theatre_Practitioners|  involve varying degrees of concern with the semiotics of acting.  |Konstantin_Stanislavski|Konstantin_Stanislavski| , for example, addresses the ways in which an actor, building on what he calls the experiencing of a role, should also shape and adjust a performance in order to support the overall significance of the drama—a process that he calls establishing the perspective of the role . The semiotics of acting plays a far more central role in  |Bertolt_Brechts|Bertolt_Brecht| |_epic_theatre|Epic_Theatre| , in which an actor is concerned to bring out clearly the sociohistorical significance of behaviour and action by means of specific performance choices—a process that he describes as establishing the  |not_but|Not_But|  element in a performed physical  gestus  within context of the plays overal  Fabel  .  |Eugenio_Barba|Eugenio_Barba|  argues that actors ought not to concern themselves with the significance of their performance behaviour; this aspect is the responsibility, he claims, of the  |director|Theatre_Director| , who weaves the signifying elements of an actors performance into the directors  |dramaturgical|Dramaturgy|  montage .     The theatre semiotician  |Patrice_Pavis|Patrice_Pavis| , alluding to the contrast between  |Stanislavskis_system|Stanislavskis_System|  and Brechts  |demonstrating|Demonstration|  performer—and, beyond that, to  |Denis_Diderots|Denis_Diderot|  foundational essay on the art of acting,  Paradox of the Actor  —argues that:   Acting was long seen in terms of the actors sincerity or hypocrisy—should he believe in what he is saying and be moved by it, or should he distance himself and convey his role in a detached manner? The answer varies according to how one sees the effect to be produced in the audience and the social function of theatre. Pavis .     Elements of a semiotics of acting include the actors gestures, facial expressions, intonation and other vocal qualities, rhythm, and the ways in which these aspects of an individual performance relate to the drama and the theatrical event considered as a whole. A semiotics of acting recognises that all forms of acting involve  |conventions|Dramatic_Convention|  and  |codes|Code|  by means of which performance behaviour acquires significance—including those approaches, such as Stanislvaskis or the closely related  |method_acting|Method_Acting|  developed in the United States, that offer themselves as a natural kind of acting that can do without conventions and be received as self-evident and universal. Pavis goes on to argue that:   Any acting is based on a codified system of behaviour and actions that are considered to be believable and realistic or artificial and theatrical. To advocate the natural, the spontaneous, and the instinctive is only to attempt to produce natural effects, governed by an  |ideological|Ideology|  code that determines, at a particular historical time, and for a given audience, what is natural and believable and what is  |declamatory|Declamation|  and theatrical.   The conventions that govern acting in general are related to structured forms of  |play|Play| , which involve, in each specific experience,  |rules_of_the_game|Game| . Pavis . This aspect was first explored by  |Johan_Huizinga|Johan_Huizinga|   and  |Roger_Caillois|Roger_Caillois|  . Pavis . Caillois, for example, distinguishes four aspects of play relevant to acting:  mimesis  ,  agon  ,  alea  , and illinx . This connection with play as an activity was first proposed by Aristotle in his Poetics, in which he defines the desire to imitate in play as an essential part of being human and our first means of  |learning_as_children|Child_Development| |mimesis|Mimesis|  ; and equally natural that everyone enjoys mimetic objects. Halliwell .   This connection with play also informed the words used in English for  |drama|Drama| |play|Play|  or game  was the standard term used until  |William_Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|  time for a dramatic entertainment—just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist , the person acting was known as a player , and, when in the  |Elizabethan_era|Elizabethan_Era|  specific buildings for acting were built, they was known as play-houses rather than  |theatres|Theater| . Wickham . The sense of the creator of plays as a maker rather than a writer is preserved in the word  |playwright|Playwright| .  |The_Theatre|The_Theatre| , one of the first purpose-built playhouses in London, was a self-conscious  |latin|Latin| ism to describe one particular playhouse rather than a term for the buildings in general . The word dramatist was at that time still unknown in the English language .       Actors and actresses need to make a resume  when they go to auditions, similarly to when people of other occupations go into an interview. The acting resume is very different from the normal resume, it has a lot less information on it with lists, instead of paragraphs and it should have the head shot  on the back.     Auditioning is the act of performing either a monologue  or sides  the casting director either mails or emails to the actors right before their audition. Auditioning entails showing the skills the actors have to instantly turn into a completely different person within a two-minute frame period. For theater auditions it can be longer than two minutes or they can perform more than one monologue, each casting director can have different requirements for actors. For auditions, actors will have to go dressed similarly to the character they are auditioning for to make it easier for the casting director to visualize them as the character. For television or film they will have to undergo more than one audition, if the casting director chooses to put them forward into the process. Oftentimes actors are called into another audition last minute and will send them the sides either the morning of or the night before. Auditioning can be part of the stressful side to acting, especially if one is not trained to audition.        |Rehearsal|Rehearsal|  is a process in which actors prepare and practice a performance, exploring the vicissitudes of  |conflict|Conflict|  between  |characters|Character| , testing specific actions in the scene, and finding means to convey a particular sense. Some actors continue to rehearse a scene throughout the run of a show in order to keep the scene fresh in their minds and exciting for the audience.       A critical audience with evaluative spectators is known to induce stress on actors during performance,  and an actor will typically rate the quality of their performance higher than their spectators. Heart rates are generally always higher during a performance with an audience when compared to rehearsal, however whats interesting is that this audience also seems to induce a higher quality of performance. Simply put, while public performances cause extremely high stress levels in actors , the stress actually improves the performance, supporting the idea of positive stress in challenging situations        Depending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary. This is the bodys way of responding to stress. Prior to a show one will see an increase in heart rate due to anxiety. While performing an actor has an increased sense of exposure which will increase  |performance_anxiety|Performance_Anxiety|  and the associated physiological arousal, such as heart rate.  Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is due to the fact that a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actors career. After the show a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity can be seen. Often the heart rate will return to normal after the show or performance is done;  however, during the applause after the performance there is a rapid spike in heart rate.  This can be seen not only in actors but also with  |public_speaking|Public_Speaking|  and  |musicians|Musicians| .         There is a correlation between heart-rate and stress when actors are performing in front of an audience. Actors claim that having an audience has no change in their stress level, but as soon as they come on stage their heart-rate rises quickly.  A 2017 study done in an American University looking at actors stress by measuring heart-rate showed individual heart-rates rose right before the performance began for those actors opening. There are many  |factors|Factor_Analysis| .
