      The Second Polish Republic, commonly known as  interwar Poland, refers to the country of  |Poland|Poland|  in the period between the  |First|World_War_I|  and  |Second_World_Wars|World_War_Ii|  . Officially known as the Republic of Poland , the state was  |re-established_in_1918|National_Independence_Day| , in the  |aftermath_of_World_War_I|Aftermath_Of_World_War_I| . The Second Republic ceased to exist in 1939, when  |Poland_was_invaded|Invasion_Of_Poland|  by  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| , the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and the  |Slovak_Republic|Slovak_Republic| , marking the beginning of the  |European_theatre_of_World_War_II|European_Theatre_Of_World_War_Ii| .     In 1938, the Second Republic was the sixth largest country in Europe. According to the  |1921_census|Polish_Census_Of_1921| , the number of inhabitants was 27.2 million. By 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, this had grown to an estimated 35.1 million. Almost a third of population came from  |minority_groups|Minority_Group| : 13.9%  |Ruthenians|Ruthenians| ; 10%  |Ashkenazi_Jews|Ashkenazi_Jews| ; 3.1%  |Belarusians|Belarusians| ; 2.3%  |Germans|Germans|  and 3.4%  |Czechs|Czechs|  and  |Lithuanians|Lithuanians| . At the same time, a significant number of ethnic Poles lived  |outside_the_countrys_borders|Polish_Diaspora| .     When, after several regional conflicts, the borders of the state were finalised in 1922, Polands neighbours were  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| ,  |Germany|Weimar_Republic| , the  |Free_City_of_Danzig|Free_City_Of_Danzig| ,  |Lithuania|Lithuania| ,  |Latvia|Latvia| ,  |Romania|Kingdom_Of_Romania|  and the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . It had access to the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of  |Gdynia|Gdynia| , known as the  |Polish_Corridor|Polish_Corridor| . Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then- |Hungarian|Kingdom_Of_Hungary|  governorate of  |Subcarpathia|Carpathian_Ruthenia_During_World_War_Ii| . The political conditions of the Second Republic were heavily influenced by the  |aftermath_of_World_War_I|Aftermath_Of_World_War_I|  and conflicts with neighbouring states as well as the emergence of  |Nazism_in_Germany|Nazi_Germany| .     The Second Republic maintained moderate economic development. The cultural hubs of interwar Poland |Warsaw|Warsaw| ,  |Kraków|Kraków| ,  |Poznań|Poznań| ,  |Wilno|Vilnius|  and  |Lwów|Lviv| became major  |Europe|Europe| an cities and the sites of internationally acclaimed universities and other institutions of higher education.            After more than a  |century_of_Partitions|Partitions_Of_Poland|  between the  |Austrian|Austrian_Partition| , the  |Prussian|Prussian_Partition| , and the  |Russian|Russian_Partition|  imperial powers, Poland re-emerged as a sovereign state at the end of the First World War in Europe in 1917-1918.

It was one of the great stories of the  |1919_Paris_Peace_Conference|Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919| .  Poland solidified its independence in a series of border wars fought by the newly formed  |Polish_Army|Polish_Army|  from 1918 to 1921.

In the course of World War I ,  |Germany|Second_Reich|  gradually gained overall dominance on the  |Eastern_Front|Eastern_Front|  as the  |Imperial_Russian_Army|Imperial_Russian_Army|  fell back. German and  |Austro-Hungarian|Austria-Hungary|  armies seized the  |Russian-ruled_part_of_what_became_Poland|Congress_Poland| . In a failed attempt to resolve the  |Polish_question|Polish_Question|  as quickly as possible, Berlin set up a  |German_puppet_state|Kingdom_Of_Poland|  on 5 November 1916, with a governing  |Provisional_Council_of_State|Provisional_Council_Of_State|  and a  |Regency_Council|Regency_Council|  . The Council administered the country under German auspices , pending  |the_election_of_a_king|Royal_Elections_In_Poland| . A month before Germany surrendered on 11 November 1918 and the war ended, the Regency Council had dissolved the  |Council_of_State|Council_Of_State| , and announced its intention to restore Polish independence . With the notable exception of the  |Marxist|Marxism| -oriented  |Social_Democratic_Party_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland_and_Lithuania|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_The_Kingdom_Of_Poland_And_Lithuania|  , most Polish political parties supported this move. On 23 October the Regency Council appointed a new government under  |Józef_Świeżyński|Józef_Świeżyński|  and began conscription into the  |Polish_Army|Polish_Army| . Richard M. Watt, Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate, 1918–1939            In 1918–1919, over 100  |workers_councils|Workers_Councils_In_Poland|  sprang up on Polish territories;  on 5 November 1918, in  |Lublin|Lublin| , the first  |Soviet_of_Delegates|Soviet_Of_Delegates|  was established. On 6 November socialists proclaimed the  |Republic_of_Tarnobrzeg|Republic_Of_Tarnobrzeg|  at Tarnobrzeg in Austrian  |Galicia|Kingdom_Of_Galicia_And_Lodomeria| . The same day the Socialist,  |Ignacy_Daszyński|Ignacy_Daszyński| , set up a  |Provisional_Peoples_Government_of_the_Republic_of_Poland|Provisional_Peoples_Government_Of_The_Republic_Of_Poland|   in Lublin. On Sunday, 10 November at 7 a.m.,  |Józef_Piłsudski|Józef_Piłsudski| , newly freed from 16 months in a German prison in  |Magdeburg|Magdeburg| , returned by train to Warsaw. Piłsudski, together with Colonel  |Kazimierz_Sosnkowski|Kazimierz_Sosnkowski| , was greeted at Warsaws railway station by Regent  |Zdzisław_Lubomirski|Zdzisław_Lubomirski|  and by Colonel  |Adam_Koc|Adam_Koc| . Next day, due to his popularity and support from most political parties, the Regency Council appointed Piłsudski as Commander in Chief of the Polish Armed Forces. On 14 November, the Council dissolved itself and transferred all its authority to Piłsudski as Chief of State . After consultation with Piłsudski, Daszyńskis government dissolved itself and a new government formed under  |Jędrzej_Moraczewski|Jędrzej_Moraczewski| . In 1918 Italy became the first country in Europe to recognise Polands renewed sovereignty. Andrzej Garlicki , Józef Piłsudski, 1867–1935.        Centers of government that formed at that time in  |Galicia|Galicia|  included the National Council of the  |Principality_of_Cieszyn|Principality_Of_Cieszyn|  , the  |Republic_of_Zakopane|Republic_Of_Zakopane|  and the  |Polish_Liquidation_Committee|Polish_Liquidation_Committee|  . Soon afterward, the  |Polish–Ukrainian_War|Polish–Ukrainian_War|  broke out in  |Lwów|Lwów|  between forces of the  |Military_Committee_of_Ukrainians|West_Ukrainian_Peoples_Republic|  and the Polish irregular units made up of students known as the  |Lwów_Eaglets|Lwów_Eaglets| , who were later supported by the Polish Army . Meanwhile, in western Poland, another war of national liberation began under the banner of the  |Greater_Poland_uprising|Greater_Poland_Uprising| . In January 1919  |Czechoslovakian|First_Czechoslovak_Republic|  forces attacked Polish units in the area of Zaolzie . Soon afterwards the  |Polish–Lithuanian_War|Polish–Lithuanian_War|  began, and in August 1919 Polish-speaking residents of  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia|  initiated a series of three  |Silesian_Uprisings|Silesian_Uprisings| . The most critical military conflict of that period, however, the  |Polish–Soviet_War|Polish–Soviet_War|  , ended in a decisive Polish victory. Norman Richard Davies, White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919–20 In 1919 the Warsaw government suppressed the Republic of Tarnobrzeg and the workers councils.            The Second Polish Republic was a  |parliamentary_democracy|Parliamentary_System|  from 1919  to 1926, with the  |President|President_Of_Poland|  having limited powers. The  |Parliament|National_Assembly_Of_The_Republic_Of_Poland|  elected him, and he could appoint the  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Poland|  as well as the government with the  |Sejms|Sejm|  approval, but he could only dissolve the Sejm with the  |Senates|Senate_Of_The_Republic_Of_Poland|  consent. Moreover, his power to pass decrees was limited by the requirement that the Prime Minister and the appropriate other Minister had to verify his decrees with their signatures. Poland was one of the first countries in the world to recognize  |womens_suffrage|Womens_Suffrage| . Women in Poland were granted the right to vote on 28 November 1918 by a decree of Józef Piłsudski. A. Polonsky, Politics in Independent Poland, 1921–1939: The Crisis of Constitutional Government     The major political parties at this time were the  |Polish_Socialist_Party|Polish_Socialist_Party| ,  |National_Democrats|National_Democracy| , various  |Peasant_Parties|Peoples_Party| ,  |Christian_Democrats|Polish_Christian_Democratic_Party| , and political groups of ethnic minorities . Frequently changing governments  and other negative publicity the politicians received , made them increasingly unpopular. Major politicians at this time, in addition to Piłsudski, included peasant activist  |Wincenty_Witos|Wincenty_Witos|  and right-wing leader  |Roman_Dmowski|Roman_Dmowski| . Ethnic minorities were represented in the  |Sejm|Sejm| ; e.g. in 1928 – 1930 there was the Ukrainian-Belarusian Club, with 26 Ukrainian and 4 Belarusian members.        After the Polish – Soviet war, Marshal Piłsudski led an intentionally modest life, writing historical books for a living. After he took power by a  |military_coup|May_Coup|  in May 1926, he emphasized that he wanted to heal the Polish society and politics of excessive partisan politics. His regime, accordingly, was called  |Sanacja|Sanation|  in Polish. The  |1928_parliamentary_elections|1928_Polish_Legislative_Election|  were still considered free and fair, although the pro-Piłsudski  |Nonpartisan_Bloc_for_Cooperation_with_the_Government|Nonpartisan_Bloc_For_Cooperation_With_The_Government|  won them. The following three parliamentary elections  were manipulated, with opposition activists sent to  |Bereza_Kartuska_prison|Bereza_Kartuska_Prison|  . As a result, pro-government party  |Camp_of_National_Unity|Camp_Of_National_Unity|  won huge majorities in them. Piłsudski died just after an  |authoritarian_constitution|April_Constitution_Of_Poland|  was approved in the spring of 1935. During the last four years of the Second Polish Republic, the major politicians included President  |Ignacy_Mościcki|Ignacy_Mościcki| , Foreign Minister  |Józef_Beck|Józef_Beck|  and the Commander-in-Chief of the  |Polish_Army|Polish_Army| ,  |Edward_Rydz-Śmigły|Edward_Rydz-Śmigły| . The country was divided into  |104_electoral_districts|Electoral_Districts_Of_Poland| , and those politicians who were forced to leave Poland, founded  |Front_Morges|Front_Morges|  in 1936. The government that ruled Second Polish Republic in its final years is frequently referred to as  |Piłsudskis_colonels|Piłsudskis_Colonels| .
