                   The   was the period in the history of the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  of about 780 years between the  |Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania|Umayyad_Conquest_Of_Hispania|  in 711 and the  |fall_of_the_Nasrid_kingdom_of_Granada|Granada_Warlast_Stand_At_Granada|  to the expanding  |Christian_kingdoms|Christendom|  in 1492.     The beginning of the  is traditionally marked with the  |Battle_of_Covadonga|Battle_Of_Covadonga|  , the first known victory in Hispania by Christian military forces since the 711 military invasion undertaken by combined  |Arab|Arab| - |Berber|Berbers|  forces. In that small battle, a group led by the nobleman  |Pelagius|Pelagius_Of_Asturias|  defeated a Muslim patrol in the mountains of northern Iberia and established the independent Christian  |Kingdom_of_Asturias|Kingdom_Of_Asturias| . In the late 10th century, the Umayyad   |vizier|Vizier| |Almanzor|Almanzor|  waged military campaigns for 30 years to subjugate the northern Christian kingdoms. His armies, mostly composed of Slavic and African  |Mamluks|Mamluk|  , ravaged the north, even sacking the great  |shrine_of_Santiago_de_Compostela|Santiagodecompostelacathedralhistory| .     When the government of  |Córdoba|Caliphate_Of_Córdoba|  disintegrated in the early 11th century, a series of petty successor states known as  taifa s  emerged. The northern kingdoms took advantage of this situation and struck deep into  |Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus| ; they fostered civil war, intimidated the weakened  taifas,  and made them pay large tributes  for protection. After a Muslim resurgence in the 12th century the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian forces in the 13th century— |Córdoba_in_1236|Siege_Of_Córdoba|  and  |Seville_in_1248|Siege_Of_Seville| —leaving only the Muslim enclave of Granada as a  |tributary_state|Tributary_State|  in the south. After 1491, the entire peninsula was controlled by Christian rulers. The conquest was followed by the  |Alhambra_Decree|Alhambra_Decree|  which  |expelled_Jews|Expulsion_Of_Jews_From_Spain|  who would not convert to Christianity from Castile and Aragon, and a series of edicts which  |forced_the_conversions_of_the_Muslims_in_Spain|Forced_Conversions_Of_Muslims_In_Spain| , although later a significant part of them were expelled from the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula| .       Traditional historiography uses the term Reconquista starting at 19th. century  for what was earlier thought of as a restoration of the  |Visigothic_Kingdom|Visigothic_Kingdom|  over conquered territories.  Sanjuán, Alejandro García.  A 1300 Años de la conquista de Al-Andalus  : 65. The concept of Reconquista, consolidated in Spanish historiography in the second half of the 19th century, was associated with the development of a Spanish national identity, emphasizing nationalistic and romantic, and occasionally, colonialist, aspects.        Since the 19th century traditional  |historiography|Historiography|  has stressed the existence of the Reconquista,  a continuous phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms, understood as a common enemy who had militarily seized territory from native Iberian Christians.    The concept of a Christian reconquest of the peninsula first emerged, in tenuous form, at the end of the 9th century.  A landmark was set by the Christian  Chronica Prophetica  , a document stressing the Christian and Muslim cultural and religious divide in Iberia and the necessity to drive the Muslims out.          Both Christian and Muslim rulers fought amongst themselves. Alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon. Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious tolerance. María Rosa Menocal, The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain, Back Bay Books, 2003, , and see  |Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain|Golden_Age_Of_Jewish_Culture_In_Spain| .     The  |Crusades|Crusades| , which started late in the 11th century, bred the religious ideology of a Christian reconquest, confronted at that time with a similarly staunch Muslim  |Jihad|Jihad|  ideology in  |Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus|  by the  |Almoravids|Almoravids| , and to an even greater degree by the  |Almohads|Almohads| . In fact, previous documents from the 10th and 11th centuries are mute on any idea of reconquest .  Propaganda accounts of Muslim-Christian hostility came into being to support that idea, most notably the  Chanson de Roland , a fictitious 11th-century French version of the  |Battle_of_Roncevaux_Pass|Battle_Of_Roncevaux_Pass|  dealing with the Iberian  Saracen s , and taught as historical fact in the French educational system since 1880.       The modern idea of Reconquista is inextricably linked to the foundational myths of  |Spanish_nationalism|Spanish_Nationalism|  in the 19th century, and consolidated by the mid-20th century during  |Francos|Francisco_Franco| |National-Catholic|National-Catholicism|  dictatorship, based on a strong underlying Castilian ideological element. García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, p. 144 García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 146–147  The idea of a liberation war of reconquest against the Muslims, depicted as foreigners, suited well the anti-Republican rebels during the  |Spanish_Civil_War|Spanish_Civil_War|  who agitated for the banner of a Spanish fatherland threatened by regional nationalisms and communism. Their rebellious pursuit was thus a crusade for the restoration of the Churchs unity, where Franco stood for both  |Pelagius_of_Asturias|Pelagius_Of_Asturias|  and  |El_Cid|El_Cid| . The Reconquista has become a rallying call for right and far-right parties in Spain to expel from office incumbent progressive or peripheral nationalist options, as well as their values, in different political contexts as of 2018.         Some contemporary authors consider it proved that the process of Christian state-building in Iberia was indeed often defined by the reclamation of lands that had been lost to the  |Moors|Moors|  in generations past. In this way, state-building might be characterised—at least in ideological, if not practical, terms—as a process by which Iberian states were being rebuilt.  In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of Reconquista as a concept created a posteriori in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests. Eugènia de Pagès, La Reconquista, allò que mai no va existir , La Lamentable, July 11, 2014,  Martín M. Ríos Saloma, La Reconquista. Génesis de un mito historiográfico , Historia y Grafía, 30, 2008, pp. 191–216, , Retrieved October 12, 2014. One of the first Spanish intellectuals to question the idea of a reconquest that lasted for eight centuries was  |José_Ortega_y_Gasset|José_Ortega_Y_Gasset| , writing in the first half of the 20th century. Yo no entiendo cómo se puede llamar reconquista a una cosa que dura ocho siglos , in España invertebrada. Quoted by De Pagès, E. July 11, 2014. However, the term reconquista is still widely in use.                   In 711, North African  |Berber|Berber_People|  soldiers with some  |Arabs|Arab|  commanded by  |Tariq_ibn_Ziyad|Tariq_Ibn_Ziyad|  crossed the  |Strait_of_Gibraltar|Strait_Of_Gibraltar| , engaging a Visigothic force led by King  |Roderic|Roderic|  at the Battle of Guadalete in a moment of serious in-fighting and division across the  |Visigothic_Kingdom_of_Hispania|Visigothic_Kingdom| .     After Roderics defeat, the Umayyad governor of  |Ifrikiya|Ifriqiya| |Musa_ibn-Nusayr|Musa_Ibn_Nusayr|  joined Tariq, directing a campaign against different towns and strongholds in Iberia. Some, like Merida, Cordova, or  |Zaragoza|Zaragoza|  in 712, probably  |Toledo|Toledo,_Spain| , were taken by storm or after resistance, but many agreed to a treaty in exchange for maintaining autonomy, in  |Theodemirs|Theodemir|  dominion , or  |Pamplona|Pamplona| , for example.  The invading Islamic armies did not exceed 60,000 men.             After the establishment of a local  |Emirate|Emirate| ,  |Caliph|Caliph| |Al-Walid_I|Al-Walid_I| , ruler of the  |Umayyad_Caliphate|Umayyad_Caliphate| , removed many of the successful Muslim commanders. Tariq ibn Ziyad was recalled to  |Damascus|Damascus|  and replaced with Musa ibn-Nusayr, who had been his former superior. Musas son, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, apparently married  |Egilona|Egilona| ,  |Roderics|Roderic|  widow, and established his regional government in  |Seville|Seville| . He was suspected of being under the influence of his wife and was accused of wanting to convert to Christianity and of planning a secessionist rebellion. Apparently a concerned Al-Walid I ordered Abd al-Azizs assassination. Caliph Al-Walid I died in 715 and was succeeded by his brother  |Sulayman_ibn_Abd_al-Malik|Sulayman_Ibn_Abd_Al-Malik| . Sulayman seems to have punished the surviving Musa ibn-Nusayr, who very soon died during a pilgrimage in 716. In the end, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musas cousin,  |Ayyub_ibn_Habib_al-Lakhmi|Ayyub_Ibn_Habib_Al-Lakhmi|  became the wali of Al-Andalus.     The conquering generals were necessarily acting independently, due to the methods of communication available. Successful generals in the field and in a distant province would gain the personal loyalty of their officers and warriors and their ambitions were likely watched by certain circles of the distant government with a degree of concern and suspicion. Old rivalries and perhaps even full-fledged conspiracies between generals may have had influence over this development. In the end, the formerly successful generals were replaced by a younger generation considered more loyal to the government in Damascus.     A serious weakness amongst the Muslim conquerors was the ethnic tension between Berbers and Arabs.  |Chris_Lowney|Chris_Lowney| , A Vanished World: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Medieval Spain, , 40. The Berbers were indigenous inhabitants of North Africa who had only recently converted to Islam; they provided most of the soldiery of the invading Islamic armies but sensed Arab discrimination against them. Roger Collins, Early Medieval Spain, , 164. This latent internal conflict jeopardized Umayyad unity. The Ummyyad forces arrived and crossed the Pyrenees by 719. The last Visigothic king  |Ardo|Ardo|  resisted them in Septimania, where he fended off the Berber-Arab armies until 720.      After the Islamic Moorish conquest of most of the Iberian Peninsula in 711–718 and the establishment of the emirate of Al-Andalus, an Umayyad expedition suffered a major defeat at the  |Battle_of_Toulouse|Battle_Of_Toulouse|  and was halted for a while on its way north.  |Odo_of_Aquitaine|Odo_Of_Aquitaine|  had married his daughter to  |Uthman_ibn_Naissa|Uthman_Ibn_Naissa| , a rebel Berber and lord of  |Cerdanya|Cerdanya|  , in an attempt to secure his southern borders in order to fend off  |Charles_Martels|Charles_Martel|  attacks on the north. However, a major  |punitive_expedition|Punitive_Expedition|  led by  |Abdul_Rahman_Al_Ghafiqi|Abdul_Rahman_Al_Ghafiqi| , the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman, and the Muslim governor mustered an expedition north across the western Pyrenees, looted areas up to Bordeaux, and defeated Odo in the  |Battle_of_the_River_Garonne|Battle_Of_The_River_Garonne|  in 732.     A desperate Odo turned to his archrival Charles Martel for help, who led the Frankish and remaining Aquitanian armies against the Umayyad armies and defeated them at the  |Battle_of_Tours|Battle_Of_Tours|  in 732, killing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. While Moorish rule began to recede, it would remain in parts of the Iberian peninsula for another 760 years.       Reconquista       A drastic increase of taxes by the emir  |Anbasa_ibn_Suhaym_Al-Kalbi|Anbasa_Ibn_Suhaym_Al-Kalbi|  provoked several rebellions in Al-Andalus, which a series of succeeding weak emirs were unable to suppress. Around 722, a Muslim military expedition was sent into the north in late summer to suppress a rebellion led by  |Pelagius_of_Asturias|Pelagius_Of_Asturias|  . Traditional historiography has hailed Pelagius  |victory_at_Covadonga|Battle_Of_Covadonga|  as the beginning of the Reconquista. No Muslim source mentions the battle at Covadonga, in contrast with the  |Battle_of_Toulouse|Battle_Of_Toulouse|  in 721, with a death toll of perhaps tens of thousands, which was mourned for centuries as a large scale tragedy by the Iberian Muslims. For Pelagius, however, the Christian victory secured his independent rule, while the precise date and circumstances of the battle are unclear. Among the possibilities is that Pelagius rebellion was successful because the greater part of the Muslim forces were focusing in  |Septimania|Septimania|  and Toulouse .     Two northern realms, the Basque Navarre  and Asturias, despite their small size, demonstrated an ability to maintain their independence. Because the Umayyad rulers based in  |Córdoba|Córdoba,_Andalusia|  were unable to extend their power over the Pyrenees, they decided to consolidate their power within the Iberian peninsula. Arab-Berber forces made periodic incursions deep into Asturias, but this area was a cul-de-sac on the fringes of the Islamic world fraught with inconveniences during campaigns and little interest.      It comes then as no surprise that, besides focusing on raiding the Arab-Berber strongholds of the Meseta, Alphonse I centred on expanding his domains at the expense of the neighbouring Galicians and Basques at either side of his realm just as much.  During the first decades, Asturian control over part of the kingdom was weak, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances and war with other peoples from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. After Pelayos death in 737, his son  |Favila_of_Asturias|Favila_Of_Asturias|  was elected king. Favila, according to the chronicles, was killed by a bear during a trial of courage. Pelayos dynasty in Asturias survived and gradually expanded the kingdoms boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly 775. However, credit is due not to him but to his successors, the Banu Alfons from the Arab chronicles. Further expansion of the northwestern kingdom towards the south occurred during the reign of Alfonso II . A kings expedition arrived in and pillaged Lisbon in 798, probably concerted with the Carolingians.      The Asturian kingdom became firmly established with the recognition of Alfonso II as king of Asturias by  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne|  and the Pope. During his reign, the bones of  |St._James_the_Great|James,_Son_Of_Zebedee|  were declared to have been found in Galicia, at  |Santiago_de_Compostela|Santiago_De_Compostela| . Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a channel of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond, centuries later.            After the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian heartland of the Visigothic kingdom, the Muslims crossed the Pyrenees and gradually took control of  |Septimania|Septimania| , starting in 719 with the conquest of  |Narbonne|Narbonne|  through 725 when  |Carcassonne|Carcassonne|  and  |Nîmes|Nîmes|  were secured. From the stronghold of Narbonne, they tried to conquer  |Aquitaine|Aquitaine|  but suffered a major defeat at the  |Battle_of_Toulouse|Battle_Of_Toulouse| .      Ten years after halting their advance north,  |Odo_of_Aquitaine|Odo_Of_Aquitaine|  married his daughter to  |Uthman_ibn_Naissa|Uthman_Ibn_Naissa| , a rebel Berber and lord of  |Cerdanya|Cerdanya|  , in an attempt to secure his southern borders to fend off  |Charles_Martels|Charles_Martel|  attacks on the north. However, a major  |punitive_expedition|Punitive_Expedition|  led by  |Abdul_Rahman_Al_Ghafiqi|Abdul_Rahman_Al_Ghafiqi| , the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman.       After expelling the Muslims  |from_Narbonne_in_759|Siege_Of_Narbonne|  and driving their forces back over the Pyrenees, the Carolingian king  |Pepin_the_Short_conquered_Aquitaine|Pepin_The_Shortexpansion_Of_The_Frankish_Realm|  in a ruthless eight-year war. Charlemagne followed his father by subduing Aquitaine by creating counties, taking the Church as his ally and appointing counts of Frankish or Burgundian stock, like his loyal  |William_of_Gellone|William_Of_Gellone| , making  |Toulouse|Toulouse|  his base for expeditions against Al-Andalus. Charlemagne decided to organize a regional subkingdom in order to keep the Aquitanians in check and to secure the southern border of the  |Carolingian_Empire|Carolingian_Empire|  against Muslim incursions. In 781, his three-year-old son  |Louis|Louis_The_Pious|  was crowned king of  |Aquitaine|Aquitaine| , under the supervision of Charlemagnes trustee William of Gellone, and was nominally in charge of the incipient  |Spanish_March|Spanish_March| .     Meanwhile, the takeover of the southern fringes of Al-Andalus by Abd ar-Rahman I in 756 was opposed by  |Yusuf_ibn_Abd_al-Rahman|Yusuf_Ibn_Abd_Al-Rahman_Al-Fihri| , autonomous governor  or king  of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman I expelled Yusuf from Cordova,  but it took still decades for him to expand to the north-western Andalusian districts. He was also opposed externally by the  |Abbasids|Abbasid_Caliphate|  of Baghdad who failed in their attempts to overthrow him. In 778, Abd al-Rahman closed in on the Ebro valley. Regional lords saw the Umayyad emir at the gates and decided to enlist the nearby Christian Franks. According to  |Ali_ibn_al-Athir|Ali_Ibn_Al-Athir| , a Kurdish historian of the 12th century, Charlemagne received the envoys of  |Sulayman_al-Arabi|Sulayman_Al-Arabi| , Husayn, and  |Abu_Taur|Abu_Taur_Of_Huesca|  at the Diet of Paderborn in 777. These rulers of  |Zaragoza|Zaragoza| ,  |Girona|Girona| ,  |Barcelona|Barcelona| , and  |Huesca|Huesca|  were enemies of Abd ar-Rahman I, and in return for Frankish military aid against him offered their homage and allegiance.      Charlemagne, seeing an opportunity, agreed upon an expedition and crossed the Pyrenees in 778. Near the city of  |Zaragoza|Zaragoza|  Charlemagne received the homage of  |Sulayman_al-Arabi|Sulayman_Al-Arabi| . However the city, under the leadership of  |Husayn|Husayn_Of_Zaragoza| , closed its gates and refused to submit. Unable to conquer the city by force, Charlemagne decided to retreat. On the way home the rearguard of the army was ambushed and destroyed by Basque forces at the  |Battle_of_Roncevaux_Pass|Battle_Of_Roncevaux_Pass| .  |The_Song_of_Roland|The_Song_Of_Roland| , a highly romanticized account of this battle, would later become one of the most famous  |chansons_de_geste|Chanson_De_Geste|  of the Middle Ages. Around 788 Abd ar-Rahman I died and was succeeded by  |Hisham_I|Hisham_I_Of_Córdoba| . In 792 Hisham proclaimed a  |jihad|Jihad| , advancing in 793 against the  |Kingdom_of_Asturias|Kingdom_Of_Asturias|  and Carolingian  |Septimania|Septimania| . They defeated William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse, in battle, but  |William|William_Of_Gellone|  led an expedition the following year across the eastern Pyrenees.  |Barcelona|Barcelona| , a major city, became a potential target for the Franks in 797, as its governor Zeid rebelled against the Umayyad emir of Córdoba. An army of the emir managed to recapture it in 799, but Louis, at the head of an army, crossed the Pyrenees and besieged the city for two years until it finally capitulated in 801.  It took place on 28 December 801.     The main passes in the Pyrenees were  |Roncesvalles|Roncesvalles| ,  |Somport|Somport|  and  |La_Jonquera|La_Jonquera| . Charlemagne established across them the vassal regions of  |Pamplona|Pamplona| ,  |Aragon|Aragon| , and  |Catalonia|Catalonia|  respectively. Catalonia was itself formed from a number of  |small_counties|Catalan_Counties| , including  |Pallars|County_Of_Pallars| ,  |Girona|Girona| , and  |Urgell|Urgell| ; it was called the Marca Hispanica by the late 8th century. They protected the eastern Pyrenees passes and shores and were under the direct control of the Frankish kings. Pamplonas first king was  |Iñigo_Arista|Iñigo_Arista| , who allied with his Muslim kinsmen the  |Banu_Qasi|Banu_Qasi|  and rebelled against Frankish overlordship and overcame a  |Carolingian_expedition_in_824|Battle_Of_Roncevaux_Pass|  that led to the setup of the  |Kingdom_of_Pamplona|Kingdom_Of_Pamplona| . Aragon, founded in 809 by  |Aznar_Galíndez|Aznar_Galíndez| , grew around  |Jaca|Jaca|  and the high valleys of the  |Aragon_River|Aragon_River| , protecting the old Roman road. By the end of the 10th century, Aragon was annexed by Navarre. Sobrarbe and Ribagorza were small counties and had little significance to the progress of the Reconquista.     In the late 9th century under  |Count_Wilfred|Wilfred_The_Hairy,_Count_Of_Barcelona| , Barcelona became the de facto capital of the region. It controlled the other counties policies in a union, which led in 948 to the independence of Barcelona under  |Count_Borrel_II|Borrell_Ii,_Count_Of_Barcelona| , who declared that the new dynasty in France  were not the legitimate rulers of France nor, as a result, of his county. These states were small and, with the exception of Navarre, did not have the capacity for attacking the Muslims in the way that Asturias did, but their mountainous geography rendered them relatively safe from being conquered, and their borders remained stable for two centuries.          In the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages| , the fight against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula became linked to the fight of the whole of  |Christendom|Christendom| . The Reconquista was originally a mere war of conquest. It only later underwent a significant shift in meaning toward a religiously justified war of liberation . The  |papacy|Papacy|  and the influential  |Abbey_of_Cluny|Abbey_Of_Cluny|  in Burgundy not only justified the acts of war but actively encouraged Christian knights to seek armed confrontation with Moorish infidels instead of with each other.     From the 11th century onwards  |indulgences|Indulgences|  were granted: In 1064  |Pope_Alexander_II|Pope_Alexander_Ii|  promised the participants of  |an_expedition_against_Barbastro|War_Of_Barbastro|   a collective indulgence 30 years before  |Pope_Urban_II|Pope_Urban_Ii|  called the  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade| . Papal interest in Christian-Muslim relations in the peninsula was not without precedent  – Popes Leo IV , John VIII and John XIX are all known to have displayed substantial interest in the region. Not until 1095 and the  |Council_of_Clermont|Council_Of_Clermont|  did the Reconquista amalgamate the conflicting concepts of a peaceful pilgrimage and armed knight-errantry. But the papacy left no doubt about the heavenly reward for knights fighting for Christ reconquistadores fighting at  |Tarragona|Tarragona|  to stay in the Peninsula rather than joining the armed pilgrimage to conquer Jerusalem, saying that their contribution for Christianity was equally important. The pope promised them the same indulgences that he had promised to those who chose to join the First Crusade.     Later  |military_orders|Military_Order|  such as the  |Order_of_Santiago|Order_Of_Santiago| ,  |Montesa|Order_Of_Montesa| ,  |Order_of_Calatrava|Order_Of_Calatrava| , and the  |Knights_Templar|Knights_Templar|  were founded or called to fight in Iberia. The Popes called the knights of Europe to join the effort to destroy the Muslim states of the peninsula. After the so-called  |Disaster_of_Alarcos|Battle_Of_Alarcos| , French, Navarrese, Castilian, Portuguese and Aragonese armies united against the Muslim forces in the massive  battle of Las Navas de Tolosa  . The large territories awarded to military orders and nobles were the origin of the  |latifundia|Latifundia|  in todays  |Andalusia|Andalusia|  and  |Extremadura|Extremadura|  in Spain, and  |Alentejo|Alentejo|  in Portugal.            In an atmosphere of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly intertwined during this period. Small, lightly equipped armies reflected the need for society to be on constant alert during the first chapters of the Reconquista. These forces were capable of moving long distances in short times, allowing a quick return home after sacking a target. The initial battles were mainly waged between clans, expelling intruder armies or sacking expeditions.     In the context of the relative isolation of the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Europe, and the contact with Moorish culture, there were military strategies and tactics that were slightly different from those found in the rest of western Europe during the early stages of the Reconquista.     Medieval Iberian armies mainly comprised two types of forces: the cavalry and the infantry, or peones . Infantry only went to war if needed, which was not frequent.         Iberian  |cavalry_tactics|Cavalry_Tactics|  involved knights approaching the enemy, throwing  |javelins|Javelin| , then withdrawing to a safe distance before commencing another assault. Once the enemy formation was sufficiently weakened, the knights charged with thrusting  |spears|Spear|  . There were three types of knights , and commoner knights . Royal knights were mainly nobles with a close relationship with the king, and thus claimed a direct Gothic inheritance.     Royal knights in the early stages of the Reconquista were equipped in the same manner as their  |Gothic|Goths|  predecessors: mail  |hauberk|Hauberk| , kite shield, a long  |sword|Sword|  , javelins, spears and a  |Visigothic_axe|Francisca| . Noble knights came from the ranks of the infanzones or lower nobles, whereas the commoner knights were not noble but were wealthy enough to afford a horse. Uniquely in Europe, these horsemen comprised a militia cavalry force with no feudal links, being under the sole control of the king or the count of  |Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile|  because of  fueros  with the crown. Both noble and common knights wore padded armour and carried javelins, spears and round-tasselled shields , as well as a sword.     The peones were  |peasants|Peasants|  who went to battle in service of their  |feudal|Feudal|  lord. Poorly equipped, with bows and arrows, spears and short swords, they were mainly used as auxiliary troops. Their function in battle was to contain the enemy troops until the cavalry arrived and to block the enemy infantry from charging the knights. The  |longbow|Longbow| , the  |composite_bow|Composite_Bow| , and the  |crossbow|Crossbow|  were the basic types of bows and were especially popular in the infantry.     In the early Middle Age Iberian armour was typically made of leather, with iron scales. Head protections consisted of a round helmet with nose protector  and a chain mail headpiece. Shields were often round or kidney-shaped, except for the kite-shaped designs used by the royal knights. Usually adorned with geometric designs, crosses or tassels, shields were made out of wood and had a leather cover.     Steel swords were the most common weapon. The cavalry used long double-edged swords and the infantry short, single-edged ones. Guards were either semicircular or straight, but always highly ornamented with geometrical patterns. Spears and javelins were up to 1.5 metres long and had an iron tip. The double-axe – made of iron, 30  cm long, and possessing an extremely sharp edge – was designed to be equally useful as a thrown weapon or in close combat. Maces and hammers were not common, but some specimens have remained and are thought to have been used by members of the cavalry.     Finally, mercenaries were an important factor, as many kings did not have enough soldiers available.  |Norsemen|Norsemen| ,  |Flemish|Flemings|  spearmen, Frankish knights, Moorish mounted archers, and Berber light cavalry were the main types of mercenaries available and used in the conflict.         This style of warfare remained dominant in the Iberian Peninsula until the late 11th century, when lance tactics entered from France, although the traditional horse javelin-shot techniques continued to be used. In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.          Shields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the familys coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, a la jineta , a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, a la brida, a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.     Around the 14th and 15th centuries heavy cavalry gained a predominant role, where knights used to wear full plate armors.       The northern principalities and kingdoms survived in their mountainous strongholds . However, they started a definite territorial expansion south at the turn of the 10th century . The fall of the Caliphate of Cordova heralded a period of military expansion for the northern kingdoms, now divided into several mighty regional powers after the division of the Kingdom of Navarre . A myriad of autonomous Christian kingdoms emerged thereafter.             The Kingdom of Asturias was located in the  |Cantabrian_Mountains|Cantabrian_Mountains| , a wet and mountainous region in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It was the first Christian power to emerge. The kingdom was established by a nobleman,  |Pelagius|Pelagius_Of_Asturias|  , who had possibly returned after the Battle of Guadalete in 711 and was elected leader of the Asturians, laying the foundations for the  |Kingdom_of_Asturias|Kingdom_Of_Asturias|  and starting the  |Astur-Leonese_dynasty|Astur-Leonese_Dynasty|  that spanned from 718 to 1037 and led the initial efforts in the Iberian peninsula to take back the territories then ruled by the Moors. Ruiz De La Peña. La monarquia asturiana 718–910, p. 27. Cangas de Onís, 2000.  / Fernández Conde. Estudios Sobre La Monarquía Asturiana, pp. 35–76. Estudios Históricos La Olmeda, 2015.  Although the new dynasty first ruled in the mountains of Asturias, with the capital of the kingdom established initially in  |Cangas_de_Onís|Cangas_De_Onís| , and was in its dawn mostly concerned with securing the territory and settling the monarchy, the latest kings  emphasized the nature of the new kingdom as heir of that in  |Toledo|Visigothic_Kingdom|  and the restoration of the Visigothic nation in order to vindicate the expansion to the south. Casariego, J.E.: Crónicas de los reinos de Asturias y León. Biblioteca Universitaria Everest, León 1985, p. 68.  However, such claims have been overall dismissed by modern historiography, emphasizing the distinct, autochthonous nature of the Cantabro-Asturian and Vasconic domains with no continuation to the Gothic Kingdom of Toledo. García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 149–150     Pelagius kingdom initially was little more than a gathering point for the existing guerrilla forces. During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelagius daughter, was married to  |Alfonso|Alfonso_I_Of_Asturias| ,  |Dux_Peter_of_Cantabrias|Duchy_Of_Cantabria|  son. Alfonsos son  |Fruela|Fruela_I_Of_Asturias|  married Munia, a Basque from  |Álava|Álava| , after crushing a Basque uprising . Their son is reported to be  |Alfonso_II|Alfonso_Ii_Of_Asturias| , while Alfonso Is daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.     Alfonsos military strategy was typical of Iberian warfare at the time. Lacking the means needed for wholesale conquest of large territories, his tactics consisted of raids in the border regions of  |Vardulia|Vardulia| . With the plunder he gained further military forces could be paid, enabling him to raid the Muslim cities of  |Lisbon|Lisbon| ,  |Zamora|Zamora| , and  |Coimbra|Coimbra| . Alfonso I also expanded his realm westwards conquering  |Galicia|Galicia| .          During the reign of  |King_Alfonso_II|Alfonso_Ii_Of_Asturias|  , the kingdom was firmly established, and a series of Muslim raids caused the transfer of the Asturian capital to  |Oviedo|Oviedo| . The king is believed to have initiated diplomatic contacts with the kings of  |Pamplona|Pamplona|  and the  |Carolingians|Carolingian| , thereby gaining official recognition for his kingdom and his crown from the  |Pope|Pope|  and  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| .     The  |bones|Relic|  of St.  |James_the_Great|James_The_Great|  were proclaimed to have been found in Iria Flavia  in 813 or probably two or three decades later. The cult of the saint was transferred later to  |Compostela|Santiago_De_Compostela|  , possibly in the early 10th century when the focus of Asturian power moved from the mountains over to León, to become the  |Kingdom_of_León|Kingdom_Of_León|  or Galicia-León. Santiagos were among many saint relics proclaimed to have been found across north-western Iberia. Pilgrims started to flow in from other Iberian Christian realms, sowing the seeds of the later  |Way_of_Saint_James|Way_Of_Saint_James|  that sparked the enthusiasm and religious zeal of continental  |Christian_Europe|Christian_Europe|  for centuries.     Despite numerous battles, neither the Umayyads nor the Asturians had sufficient forces to secure control over these northern territories. Under the reign of  |Ramiro|Ramiro_I_Of_Asturias| , famed for the highly legendary  |Battle_of_Clavijo|Battle_Of_Clavijo| , the border began to slowly move southward and Asturian holdings in  |Castile|Castile| , Galicia, and  |León|León|  were fortified, and an intensive program of re-population of the countryside began in those territories. In 924 the Kingdom of Asturias became the  |Kingdom_of_León|Kingdom_Of_León| , when León became the seat of the royal court .           |Alfonso_III_of_Asturias|Alfonso_Iii_Of_Asturias|  repopulated the strategically important city  |León|León,_Spain|  and established it as his capital. King Alfonso began a series of campaigns to establish control over all the lands north of the  |Douro|Douro|  river. He reorganized his territories into the major duchies  and major counties , and fortified the borders with many castles. At his death in 910 the shift in regional power was completed as the kingdom became the  |Kingdom_of_León|Kingdom_Of_León| . From this power base, his heir  |Ordoño_II|Ordoño_Ii_Of_León|  was able to organize attacks against  |Toledo|Toledo,_Spain|  and even  |Seville|Seville| .     The  |Caliphate_of_Córdoba|Caliphate_Of_Córdoba|  was gaining power, and began to attack León. King Ordoño allied with Navarre against Abd-al-Rahman, but they were  |defeated_in_Valdejunquera|Battle_Of_Valdejunquera|  in 920. For the next 80 years, the Kingdom of León suffered civil wars, Moorish attack, internal intrigues and assassinations, and the partial independence of Galicia and Castile, thus delaying the reconquest and weakening the Christian forces. It was not until the following century that the Christians started to see their conquests as part of a long-term effort to restore the unity of the Visigothic kingdom.     The only point during this period when the situation became hopeful for León was the reign of  |Ramiro_II|Ramiro_Ii_Of_León| . King Ramiro, in alliance with  |Fernán_González_of_Castile|Fernán_González_Of_Castile|  and his retinue of caballeros villanos,  |defeated_the_Caliph_in_Simancas|Battle_Of_Simancas|  in 939. After this battle, when the Caliph barely escaped with his guard and the rest of the army was destroyed, King Ramiro obtained 12 years of peace, but he had to give González the independence of Castile as payment for his help in the battle. After this defeat, Moorish attacks abated until  |Almanzor|Almanzor|  began his campaigns.  |Alfonso_V|Alfonso_V_Of_León|  finally regained control over his domains in 1002. Navarre, though attacked by Almanzor, remained intact.     The conquest of León did not include Galicia which was left to temporary independence after the withdrawal of the Leonese king. Galicia was conquered soon after . However, this brief period of independence meant that Galicia remained a kingdom and fief of Leon, which is the reason it is part of Spain and not Portugal. Subsequent kings titled themselves kings of Galicia and León, instead of merely king of León as the two were united personally and not in union.              |Ferdinand_I_of_León|Ferdinand_I_Of_León|  was the leading king of the mid-11th century. He conquered  |Coimbra|Coimbra|  and attacked the  |taifa|Taifa|  kingdoms, often demanding the tributes known as  |parias|Parias| . Ferdinands strategy was to continue to demand parias until the taifa was greatly weakened both militarily and financially. He also repopulated the Borders with numerous fueros. Following the Navarrese tradition, on his death in 1064 he divided his kingdom between his sons. His son  |Sancho_II_of_Castile|Sancho_Ii_Of_Castile|  wanted to reunite the kingdom of his father and attacked his brothers, with a young noble at his side: Rodrigo Díaz, later known as  |El_Cid_Campeador|El_Cid_Campeador| . Sancho was killed in the siege of  |Zamora|Zamora|  by the traitor Bellido Dolfos in 1072. His brother  |Alfonso_VI|Alfonso_Vi_Of_Castile|  took over León, Castile and Galicia.     Alfonso VI the Brave gave more power to the fueros and repopulated  |Segovia|Segovia| ,  |Ávila|Ávila|  and  |Salamanca|Salamanca| . Once he had secured the Borders, King Alfonso conquered the powerful  |Taifa_kingdom_of_Toledo|Taifa_Of_Toledo|  in 1085.  |Toledo|Toledo,_Spain| , which was the former capital of the Visigoths, was a very important landmark, and the conquest made Alfonso renowned throughout the Christian world. However, this conquest was conducted rather gradually, and mostly peacefully, during the course of several decades. It was not until after sporadic and consistent population resettlements had taken place that Toledo was decisively conquered.     Alfonso VI was first and foremost a tactful monarch who chose to understand the kings of taifa and employed unprecedented diplomatic measures to attain political feats before considering the use of force. He adopted the title  Imperator totius Hispaniae  . Alfonsos more aggressive policy towards the taifas worried the rulers of those kingdoms, who called on the African  |Almoravids|Almoravid|  for help.          The  |Kingdom_of_Pamplona|Kingdom_Of_Pamplona|  primarily extended along either side of the Pyrenees on the Atlantic Ocean. The kingdom was formed when local leader Íñigo Arista led a revolt against the regional Frankish authority and was elected or declared King in Pamplona , establishing a kingdom inextricably linked at this stage to their kinsmen, the  |muwallad|Muwallad| |Banu_Qasi|Banu_Qasi|  of Tudela.     Although relatively weak until the early 11th century, Pamplona took a more active role after the accession of  |Sancho_the_Great|Sancho_Iii_Of_Pamplona|  . The kingdom expanded greatly under his reign, as it absorbed Castile, Leon, and what was to be Aragon, in addition to other small counties that would unite and become the  |Principality_of_Catalonia|Principality_Of_Catalonia| . This expansion also led to the independence of Galicia, as well as gaining overlordship over  |Gascony|Gascony| .     In the 12th century, however, the kingdom contracted to its core, and in 1162 King  |Sancho_VI|Sancho_Vi_Of_Navarre|  declared himself  |king_of_Navarre|Kingdom_Of_Navarre| . Throughout its early history, the Navarrese kingdom engaged in frequent skirmishes with the Carolingian Empire, from which it maintained its independence, a key feature of its history until 1513.               The Kingdom of Aragon started off as an offshoot of the Kingdom of Navarre. It was formed when  |Sancho_III_of_Navarre|Sancho_Iii_Of_Navarre|  decided to divide his large realm among all his sons. Aragon was the portion of the realm which passed to  |Ramiro_I_of_Aragon|Ramiro_I_Of_Aragon| , an illegitimate son of Sancho III. The kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre were several times united in personal union until the death of  |Alfonso_the_Battler|Alfonso_The_Battler|  in 1135.     In 1137 the heiress of the kingdom married the  |count_of_Barcelona|Count_Of_Barcelona| , and their son  |Alfonso_II|Alfonso_Ii_Of_Aragon|  ruled from 1162 the combined possessions of his parents, resulting in what modern historians call the  |Crown_of_Aragon|Crown_Of_Aragon| .     In the following centuries, the Crown of Aragon conquered a number of territories in the Iberian peninsula and the Mediterranean, including the  |kingdom_of_Valencia|Kingdom_Of_Valencia|  and the  |kingdom_of_Mallorca|Kingdom_Of_Mallorca| .  |James_I_of_Aragon|James_I_Of_Aragon| , also known as James the Conqueror, expanded his territories to the north, south and east. James also signed the  |Treaty_of_Corbeil|Treaty_Of_Corbeil| , which released him from the nominal suzerainty of the King of France.     Early in his reign, James attempted to reunite the Aragonese and Navarrese crowns through a treaty with the childless  |Sancho_VII_of_Navarre|Sancho_Vii_Of_Navarre| . But the Navarrese nobles rejected him, and chose  |Theobald_IV_of_Champagne|Theobald_Iv_Of_Champagne|  in his stead.     Later on,  |Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon|Ferdinand_Ii_Of_Aragon| , married  |Isabella_of_Castile|Isabella_Of_Castile| , leading to a dynastic union which eventually gave birth to modern  |Spain|Spain| , after the conquest of Upper  |Navarre|Kingdom_Of_Navarre|  and the  |kingdom_of_Granada|Kingdom_Of_Granada| .               In 1139, after an overwhelming victory in the  |Battle_of_Ourique|Battle_Of_Ourique|  against the  |Almoravids|Almoravid_Dynasty| ,  |Afonso_Henriques|Afonso_Henriques|  was proclaimed the first  |King_of_Portugal|List_Of_Portuguese_Monarchs|  by his troops. According to the legend, Christ announced from heaven Afonsos great deeds, whereby he would establish the first  |Portuguese_Cortes|Portuguese_Cortes|  at  |Lamego|Lamego|  and be crowned by the  |Primate|Primate| |Archbishop_of_Braga|Archbishop_Of_Braga| . In the  |Treaty_of_Zamora|Treaty_Of_Zamora|  in 1143,  |Alfonso_VII_of_León_and_Castile|Alfonso_Vii_Of_León_And_Castile|  recognized Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León.     In 1147, Portugal  |captured_Santarém|Conquest_Of_Santarém| , and seven months later the city of  |Lisbon|Lisbon|  was also brought under Portuguese control after the  |Siege_of_Lisbon|Siege_Of_Lisbon| . By the papal bull  |Manifestis_Probatum|Manifestis_Probatum| ,  |Pope_Alexander_III|Pope_Alexander_Iii|  recognized Afonso Henriques as King of Portugal in 1179.     With  |Portugal|Portugal|  finally recognized as an independent kingdom by its neighbours,  |Afonso_Henriques|Afonso_Henriques|  and his successors, aided by  |Crusaders|Crusades|  and the military monastic orders the  |Knights_Templar|Knights_Templar| , the  |Order_of_Aviz|Order_Of_Aviz|  or the  |Order_of_Saint_James|Order_Of_Saint_James_Of_The_Sword| , pushed the  |Moors|Moors|  to the  |Algarve|Algarve|  on the southern coast of Portugal. After several campaigns, the Portuguese part in the Reconquista came to an end with the definitive capture of the Algarve in 1249. With all of Portugal now under the control of  |Afonso_III_of_Portugal|Afonso_Iii_Of_Portugal| , religious, cultural and ethnic groups became gradually homogenized.          After the completion of the Reconquista, the Portuguese territory was a Roman Catholic realm. Nonetheless,  |Denis_of_Portugal|Denis_Of_Portugal|  carried out a short war with  |Castile|Crown_Of_Castile|  for possession of the towns of  |Serpa|Serpa|  and  |Moura|Moura_Municipality| . After this, Denis avoided war; he signed the  |Treaty_of_Alcanizes|Treaty_Of_Alcanizes|  with  |Ferdinand_IV_of_Castile|Ferdinand_Iv_Of_Castile|  in 1297, establishing the present-day borders.     During the suppression of the Knights Templar all over  |Europe|Europe| , under the influence of  |Philip_IV_of_France|Philip_Iv_Of_France|  and  |Pope_Clement_V|Pope_Clement_V|  requesting its annihilation by 1312, King Denis reinstituted the Templars of  |Tomar|Tomar|  as the  |Order_of_Christ|Order_Of_Christ|  in 1319. Denis believed that the Orders assets should by their nature stay in any given Order instead of being taken by the King, largely for the Templars contribution to the Reconquista and the reconstruction of Portugal after the wars.     The experience gained during the battles of the Reconquista was fundamental to  |Conquest_of_Ceuta|Conquest_Of_Ceuta| , the first step to the establishment of the  |Portuguese_Empire|Portuguese_Empire| . Likewise, the contact with  |Muslims_navigation_techniques_and_sciences|Islamic_Golden_Age|  enabled the creation of  |Portuguese_nautical_innovations|Portuguese_Renaissance|  such as the  |caravel|Caravel|  – the principal Portuguese ship during their voyages of exploration in the  |Age_of_Discovery|Age_Of_Discovery| .        Minor Christian realms were the  |Kingdom_of_Viguera|Kingdom_Of_Viguera|  , the  |Lordship_of_Albarracín|Lordship_Of_Albarracín|  and the  |Principality_of_Valencia|:Es:Señorío_De_Valencia|  .       Clashes and raids on bordering Andalusian lands did not keep the Christian kingdoms from battling among themselves or allying with Muslim kings. Some Muslim kings had Christian-born wives or mothers. Some Christian champions, like  |El_Cid|El_Cid| , were contracted by  |taifa|Taifa|  kings to fight against their neighbours. Indeed,  |El_Cids|El_Cid|  first battle experience was gained fighting for a Muslim state against a Christian state. At the  |Battle_of_Graus|Battle_Of_Graus|  in 1063, he and other Castilians fought on the side of  |al-Muqtadir|Ahmad_Al-Muqtadir| , Muslim  |sultan|Sultan|  of  |Zaragoza|Zaragoza| , against the forces of  |Ramiro_I_of_Aragon|Ramiro_I_Of_Aragon| . There is even an instance of a crusade being declared against another Christian king in Iberia. Joseph OCallaghan . Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain, Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press. p.  62.     Following the disastrous defeat of  |Alfonso_VIII|Alfonso_Viii| , King of Castile, at  |Alarcos|Battle_Of_Alarcos| , Kings  |Alfonso_IX|Alfonso_Ix|  of León and  |Sancho_VII|Sancho_Vii|  of Navarre entered an alliance with the  |Almohads|Almohad_Caliphate|  and invaded Castile in 1196. By the end of the year Sancho VII had dropped out of the war under Papal pressure. Early in 1197, at the request of  |Sancho_I|Sancho_I_Of_Portugal| , King of Portugal, Pope  |Celestine_III|Celestine_Iii|  declared a crusade against Alfonso IX and released his subjects from their responsibilities to the king, declaring that the men of his realm shall be absolved from their fidelity and his dominion by authority of the apostolic see. Together the Kings of Portugal, Castile, and  |Aragon|Kingdom_Of_Aragon|  invaded León. In the face of this onslaught combined with pressure from the Pope, Alfonso IX was finally forced to sue for peace in October 1197.     In the late years of Al-Andalus, Castile had the might to conquer the remnants of the kingdom of  |Granada|Granada| , but the kings preferred to claim the tribute of the Muslim  parias . The trade of Granadan goods and the parias were a major means by which African gold entered  |medieval_Europe|Medieval_Europe| .          The Reconquista was a process not only of war and conquest, but also of  |repopulation|Colonization| . Christian kings moved their own people to locations abandoned by Muslims in order to have a population capable of defending the borders. The main repopulation areas were the  |Douro|Douro|  Basin , the high  |Ebro|Ebro|  valley  and central  |Catalonia|Catalonia| . The repopulation of the  |Douro|Douro|  Basin took place in two distinct phases. North of the river, between the 9th and 10th centuries, the pressure  system was employed. South of the  |Douro|Douro| , in the 10th and 11th centuries, the presura led to the charters . Fueros were used even south of the Central Range.     The presura referred to a group of peasants who crossed the mountains and settled in the abandoned lands of the Douro Basin. Asturian laws promoted this system, for instance granting a peasant all the land he was able to work and defend as his own property. Of course, Asturian and Galician minor nobles and clergymen sent their own expeditions with the peasants they maintained. This led to very feudalised areas, such as  |León|León|  and Portugal, whereas Castile, an arid land with vast plains and harsh climate, only attracted peasants with no hope in Biscay. As a consequence, Castile was governed by a single count, but had a largely non-feudal territory with many  |free|Wikt:Freeman|  peasants. Presuras also appear in Catalonia, when the count of Barcelona ordered the Bishop of Urgell and the count of Gerona to repopulate the plains of  |Vic|Vic| .     During the 10th century and onwards, cities and towns gained more importance and power, as commerce reappeared and the population kept growing.  Fuero s were  |charters|Charter|  documenting the privileges and usages given to all the people repopulating a town. The fueros provided a means of escape from the  |feudal_system|Feudal_System| , as fueros were only granted by the monarch. As a result, the town council was dependent on the monarch alone and, in turn, was required to provide auxilium – aid or troops – for their monarch. The military force of the towns became the caballeros villanos. The first fuero was given by count  |Fernán_González|Fernán_González|  to the inhabitants of  |Castrojeriz|Castrojeriz|  in the 940s. The most important towns of medieval Iberia had fueros, or forais. In Navarre, fueros were the main repopulating system. Later on, in the 12th century, Aragon also employed the system; for example, the fuero of  |Teruel|Teruel| , which was one of the last fueros, in the early 13th century.     From the mid-13th century on, no more charters were granted, as the demographic pressure had disappeared and other means of re-population were created. Fueros remained as city charters until the 18th century in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia and until the 19th century in Castile and Navarre. Fueros had an immense importance for those living under them, who were prepared to go to war to defend their rights under the charter. In the 19th century, the abolition of the fueros in Navarre would be one of the causes of the  |Carlist_Wars|Carlist_Wars| . In Castile, disputes over the system contributed to the war against Charles I .                During the 9th century the Berbers returned to North Africa in the aftermath of revolts. Many governors of large cities distant from the capital, Córdoba, had planned to establish their independence. Then, in 929, the  |Emir_of_Córdoba|Emir_Of_Córdoba|  , the leader of the Umayyad dynasty, declared himself  |Caliph|Caliph| , independent from the  |Abbasids|Abbasid|  in  |Baghdad|Baghdad| . He took all the military, religious, and political power and reorganised the army and the bureaucracy.     After regaining control over the dissident governors, Abd-ar-Rahman III tried to conquer the remaining Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, attacking them several times and forcing them back beyond the  |Cantabrian_Mountains|Cantabrian_Mountains| . Abd-ar-Rahmans grandson later became a puppet in the hands of the great  |Vizier|Vizier| |Almanzor|Al-Mansur_Ibn_Abi_Aamir|  . Almanzor waged several campaigns attacking and sacking  |Burgos|Burgos| , León,  |Pamplona|Pamplona| ,  |Barcelona|Barcelona| , and  |Santiago_de_Compostela|Santiago_De_Compostela|  before his death in 1002.     Between Almanzors death and 1031, Al-Andalus suffered many civil wars, which ended in the division into the  |Taifa_kingdoms|Taifa| . The taifas were small kingdoms, established by the city governors. The result was many small kingdoms, each centered upon its capital. Their governors had no larger-scale vision of the Moorish presence in the Iberian peninsula and had no qualms about attacking their neighbouring kingdoms whenever they could gain advantage by doing so.     The split into the taifa states weakened the Islamic presence, and the Christian kingdoms further advanced as  |Alfonso_VI_of_León_and_Castile|Alfonso_Vi_Of_León_And_Castile|  conquered  |Toledo|Toledo,_Spain|  in 1085. Surrounded by enemies, taifa rulers sent a desperate appeal to the Berber chieftain  |Yusuf_ibn_Tashfin|Yusuf_Ibn_Tashfin| , leader of the Almoravids.                The  |Almoravids|Almoravid|  were a Muslim militia primarily composed of Berber and  |African|Ethnic_Groups_Of_Africa|  Moors, and unlike previous Muslim rulers, they were not so tolerant towards Christians and Jews. Their armies entered the Iberian peninsula on several occasions and defeated King Alfonso at the  |Battle_of_Sagrajas|Battle_Of_Sagrajas|  in 1086, but initially their purpose was to unite all the taifas into a single Almoravid Caliphate. Their actions halted the southward expansion of the Christian kingdoms. Their only defeat came at  |Valencia|Valencia|  in 1094, due to the actions of  |El_Cid|El_Cid| .     Meanwhile, Navarre lost all importance under King  |Sancho_IV|Sancho_Iv_Of_Navarre| , for he lost Rioja to  |Sancho_II_of_Castile|Sancho_Ii_Of_Castile| , and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king  |Sancho_Ramírez|Sancho_Ramírez| , King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre and expanding the borders south, conquering Wasqa t   |Huesca|Huesca|  deep in the valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25  km from Saraqusta t   |Zaragoza|Zaragoza| .     Catalonia came under intense pressure from the taifas of Zaragoza and  |Lérida|Taifa_Of_Lérida| , as well as from internal disputes, as Barcelona suffered a dynastic crisis that led to open war among the smaller counties. But by the 1080s, the situation had calmed down, and the dominion of Barcelona over the smaller counties was restored.             After a brief period of disintegration , the Almohads, the rising power in North Africa, took over most of Al-Andalus. However they were decisively defeated at the  |Battle_of_Las_Navas_de_Tolosa|Battle_Of_Las_Navas_De_Tolosa|  by a Christian coalition, losing almost all the remaining lands of Al-Andalus in the following decades. By 1252 only the  |Kingdom_of_Granada|Kingdom_Of_Granada|  remained intact but as a vassal state of Castile.           |Ferdinand_and_Isabella|Catholic_Monarchs|  completed the Reconquista with a war against the  |Emirate_of_Granada|Emirate_Of_Granada|  that started in 1482 and ended with Granadas surrender on January 2, 1492. The Moors in Castile previously numbered half a million within the realm . By 1492 some 100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 had emigrated, and 200,000 remained in Castile. Many of the Muslim elite, including Granadas former Emir  |Muhammad_XII|Muhammad_Xii_Of_Granada| , who had been given the area of the  |Alpujarras|Alpujarras|  mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and emigrated to  |Tlemcen|Tlemcen|  in North Africa. Kamen, Henry. Spain 1469 – 1714 A Society of Conflict. Third edition. pp. 37–38     In 1497 Spanish forces took  |Melilla|Melilla| , west of Oran, and the island of  |Djerba|Djerba| , south of Tunis, and went on to more important gains, with the bloody  |seizure_of_Oran_in_1509|Spanish_Conquest_Of_Oran| , and the capture of  |Bougie|Bougie|  and  |Tripoli_in_1510|Spanish_Conquest_Of_Tripoli| . The Spanish capture of  |Tripoli|Tripoli|  cost them some 300 men, while the inhabitants suffered between 3,000 and 5,000 killed and another 5,000–6,000 carried off as slaves.  Soon thereafter, however, they faced competition from the rapidly expanding  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  in the east and were pushed back.               As elsewhere in the Muslim world, Christians and Jews were allowed to retain their religions, with their own legal systems and courts, by paying a tax, the  jizya . The penalty for not paying it was imprisonment and death.     The new Christian hierarchy demanded heavy taxes from non-Christians and gave them rights, such as in the  |Treaty_of_Granada|Treaty_Of_Granada|  only for Moors in recently Islamic Granada. On July 30, 1492, all the Jewish community – some 200,000 people – were forcibly expelled. , The Jewish Virtual Library. The next year the  |Alhambra_decree|Alhambra_Decree|  ordered the expulsion of practicing Jews, leading many to convert to Catholicism. In 1502, Queen Isabella I declared conversion to Catholicism compulsory within the Kingdom of Castile.

Graduate Center, CUNY. Many local officials took advantage of the situation to seize property.            Most of the descendants of those Muslims who submitted to conversion to Christianity – rather than exile – during the early periods of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, the Moriscos, were later  |expelled_from_Spain|Expulsion_Of_The_Moriscos|  after serious social upheaval, when the Inquisition was at its height. The expulsions were carried out more severely in eastern Spain due to local animosity towards Muslims and Moriscos where they were seen as economic rivals by local workers who saw them as cheap labor undermining their bargaining position with the landlords. Exactions imposed on the Moriscos paved the way to a major  |Morisco_revolt|Morisco_Revolt|  happening in 1568, with the final  |expulsion_of_the_Moriscos|Expulsion_Of_The_Moriscos|  from  |Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile|  taking place in 1609; they were driven from  |Aragon|Aragon|  at about the same time.     Making things more complex were the many former Muslims and Jews known as  Morisco s,  Marrano s, and  Converso s, who shared ancestors in common with many Christians, especially among the aristocracy, causing much concern over loyalty and attempts by the aristocracy to hide their non-Christian ancestry. Some – the numbers are debated – continued to secretly practice their religions and use their languages well into the sixteenth century.   Those that the  |Spanish_Inquisition|Spanish_Inquisition|  found to be secretly practicing Islam or Judaism were executed, imprisoned, or exiled. Nevertheless, all those deemed to be New Christians were repeatedly suspected of illegally continuing in secret to practice their religions various  |crimes_against_the_Spanish_state|Treason|  including continued practice of Islam or Judaism. New Christians were subject to many discriminatory practices starting in the sixteenth century.          The many advances and retreats created several social types:   The  Muladi  Mozarab s |Latin|Latin|  language.    |New_Christians|New_Christians|  : Jews converting to Christianity called  conversos , or pejoratively  Marrano s. Jews converted to Christianity voluntarily or through force. Some were  |Crypto-Jews|Crypto-Jews|  who continued practicing  |Judaism|Judaism|  secretly. All remaining Jews were expelled from Spain as a consequence of the 1492  |Alhambra_Decree|Alhambra_Decree| , and from Portugal in 1497. Former Jews were subject to the  |Spanish|Spanish_Inquisition|  and  |Portuguese_Inquisitions|Portuguese_Inquisition| , established to enforce Christian faith and practice, which often resulted in secret investigations and public punishments of conversos in  |autos-da-fé|Auto-Da-Fé|  , often public executions by burning the victim alive.   The  Mudéjar  Morisco sconversos. Muslims who were forced to convert to Catholicism. A significant number were Crypto-Muslims who continued practicing Islam secretly. They ranged from successful skilled artisans, valued and protected in Aragon, to impoverished peasants in Castile. After the Alhambra Decree the entire Islamic population was forced to convert or leave, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century a significant number were expelled in the  |expulsion_of_the_Moriscos|Expulsion_Of_The_Moriscos| .            Real, legendary, and fictional episodes from the Reconquista are the subject of much of medieval  |Galician-Portuguese|Galician-Portuguese| ,  |Spanish|Spanish_Literature| , and  |Catalan_literature|Catalan_Literature|  such as the  cantar de gesta .      Some noble  |genealogies|Genealogy|  show the close relations between Muslims and Christians. For example,  |Al-Mansur_Ibn_Abi_Aamir|Al-Mansur_Ibn_Abi_Aamir| , whose rule is considered to have marked the peak of power for Moorish Al-Andalus Iberia, married Abda, daughter of  |Sancho_Garcés_II|Sancho_Ii_Of_Navarra|  of  |Navarra|Navarra| , who bore him a son, named Abd al-Rahman and commonly known in a pejorative sense as  |Sanchuelo|Sanchuelo|  .     After his fathers death, Sanchuelo/Abd al-Rahman, as a son of a Christian princess, was a strong contender to take over the ultimate power in Muslim al-Andalus. A hundred years later, King  |Alfonso_VI_of_Castile|Alfonso_Vi_Of_Castile| , considered among the greatest of the Medieval Spanish kings, designated as his heir his son by the refugee  |Muslim|Muslim|  princess  |Zaida_of_Seville|Zaida_Of_Seville| .     The Reconquista was a war with long periods of respite between the adversaries, partly for pragmatic reasons and also due to infighting among the Christian kingdoms of the North spanning over seven centuries. Some populations practiced Islam or Christianity as their own religion during these centuries, so the identity of contenders changed over time.          Currently, festivals called  moros y cristianos  , moros i cristians , mouros e cristãos and mouros e cristiáns , which all mean Moors and Christians , recreate the fights as colorful parades with elaborate garments and lots of fireworks, especially on the central and southern towns of the  |Land_of_Valencia|Land_Of_Valencia| , like  |Alcoi|Alcoi| ,  |Ontinyent|Ontinyent|  or  |Villena|Villena| .       A 2016 study found that the rate of Reconquest —how rapidly the Christian frontier was expanded—has persistent effects on the Spanish economy to this day. After an initial phase of military conquest, Christians states incorporated the conquered land. When large frontier regions were incorporated at once, the land was mostly given to the nobility and the military orders, with negative effects on long-term development. The incorporation of small regions, on the other hand, generally allowed for the participation of individual settlers and was more likely to fall under the auspices of the crown. This led to a more equitable distribution of land and greater social equality, with positive effects on long-term development.           On the conclusion of Iberian victory over the Moors, the Iberian powers, Spain and Portugal didnt stop their warring against the Muslims solely in their homelands—they extended the conflict against Islam overseas. The Spanish under the Habsburg dynasty soon became the champions of Roman Catholicism in Europe and the Mediterranean against the encroaching threat of the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman-Habsburg_Wars| . In a similar vein, the Portuguese also extended the Reconquista, this time against Muslim states overseas. The  |conquest_of_Ceuta|Conquest_Of_Ceuta|  marked the beginning of Portuguese expansion into Muslim Africa.
