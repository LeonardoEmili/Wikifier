      Sir Robert William Askin,  |GCMG|Knight_Grand_Cross_Of_The_Order_Of_St_Michael_And_St_George|  , was an Australian politician and the 32nd  |Premier_of_New_South_Wales|Premier_Of_New_South_Wales|  from 1965 to 1975, the first representing the  |Liberal_Party|Liberal_Party_Of_Australia| . He was born in 1907 as Robin William Askin, but always disliked his first name and changed it by  |deed_poll|Deed_Poll|  in 1971. Before being knighted in 1972, however, he was generally known as Bob Askin. Born in Sydney in 1907, Askin was educated at  |Sydney_Technical_High_School|Sydney_Technical_High_School| . After serving as a bank officer and as a Sergeant in the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , Askin joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the seat of  |Collaroy|Electoral_District_Of_Collaroy|  at the 1950 election.     Askin quickly rose through party ranks, eventually becoming Deputy Leader following  |Walter_Howarths|Walter_Howarth|  resignation in July 1954. When long-serving party leader  |Vernon_Treatt|Vernon_Treatt|  announced his resignation in August 1954, Askin put his name forward to replace him. At the vote, he became deadlocked against  |Pat_Morton|Pat_Morton|  and Askin asked his former commanding officer  |Murray_Robson|Murray_Robson|  to take the leadership instead. Robson did not live up to expectations and was deposed in September 1955 by Morton, who then became Leader. Askin remained as Deputy until, after leading the party to a second electoral defeat in 1959, Morton was deposed and Askin was elected to succeed him. At the  |May_1965_election|1965_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , Askin presented the Liberal Party as a viable alternative government. He won a narrow victory, ending a 24-year  |Labor|Australian_Labor_Party|  hold on government.     Askins time in office was marked by a significant increase in public works programs, strong opposition to an increase in Commonwealth powers, laissez-faire economic policies and wide-ranging reforms in laws and regulations such as the  |Law_Reform_Commission|Law_Reform_Commission_Of_New_South_Wales| , the introduction of consumer laws, legal aid, breath-testing of drivers, the liberalisation of liquor laws and the restoration of  |Postal_voting|Postal_Voting|  in NSW elections. More controversial changes included the 1967 abolition of  |Sydney_City_Council|Sydney_City_Council|  and increased rates of development in Sydney, often at the expense of architectural heritage and historic buildings. This culminated in the  |Green_ban|Green_Ban|  movement of the 1970s led by the Union movement to conserve the heritage of Sydney.     At the end of his term, after winning another three elections, Askin was the longest-serving Premier of New South Wales; his record has since been overtaken by  |Neville_Wran|Neville_Wran|  and  |Bob_Carr|Bob_Carr| . Askin remains the longest-serving  |Leader_of_the_New_South_Wales_Liberal_Party|Leader_Of_The_New_South_Wales_Liberal_Party| . Since his death in 1981, however, Askins legacy has been tarnished by persistent allegations that he was involved in organised crime and official corruption.       Robin William Askin was born in  |Sydney|Sydney| ,  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales|  on 4 April 1907 at the  |Crown_Street_Womens_Hospital|Crown_Street_Womens_Hospital| , the eldest of three sons of Ellen Laura Halliday and William James Askin, an  |Adelaide|Adelaide,_South_Australia| -born sailor and worker for  |New_South_Wales_Railways|New_South_Wales_Government_Railways| . His parents later married on 29 September 1916.  Askin spent his early years in  |Stuart_Town|Stuart_Town,_New_South_Wales|  before his family moved to  |Glebe|Glebe,_New_South_Wales| , a working-class inner-city suburb of Sydney. After primary education at Glebe Public School, Askin was awarded a bursary to study at  |Sydney_Technical_High_School|Sydney_Technical_High_School| , where he sat in the same class as the future aviator  |Charles_Kingsford_Smith|Charles_Kingsford_Smith| . At school he gained good marks, with a particular interest in Mathematics and History, and enjoyed swimming and Rugby League. He completed his Intermediate Certificate in 1921.       At the age of 15, after a short time in the electrical trade, in 1922 Askin joined the  |Government_Savings_Bank_of_New_South_Wales|Commonwealth_Bank|  as a Clerk. However, when the Savings Bank closed due to the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression|  in 1931, he joined the  |Rural_Bank_of_New_South_Wales|State_Bank_Of_New_South_Wales| . Between 1925 and 1929 Askin served part-time as a  |Lieutenant|Lieutenant|  in the  |55th_Battalion|55Th_Battalion| ,  |Citizens_Military_Forces|Australian_Army_Reserve| . On 5 February 1937 Askin married Mollie Isabelle Underhill, a typist at the bank, at Gilbert Park Methodist Church,  |Manly|Manly,_New_South_Wales| . They lived in Manly for the rest of their lives. He began his interest in politics by assisting in  |Percy_Spenders|Percy_Spender|  successful campaign for Askins local seat of  |Warringah|Division_Of_Warringah|  as an Independent candidate at the  |1937_Federal_election|1937_Australian_Federal_Election| .  In 1940 Askin was appointed manager of the Bank service department, which focused on public relations. He served as Vice-President from 1939 to 1940 and President from 1940 to 1941 of the Rural Bank branch of the United Bank Officers’ Association.     Askin enlisted as a Private in the  |Second_Australian_Imperial_Force|Second_Australian_Imperial_Force|  on 30 March 1942. An instructor with the 14th Infantry Training Battalion at  |Dubbo|Dubbo| , he was appointed Acting Corporal, then reverted to Private. In November 1942 he joined the  |2/31st_Infantry_Battalion|2/31St_Battalion|  in  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea_Campaign| , where he served for two months. He was in New Guinea for another six months from July 1943. Landing at  |Balikpapan|Battle_Of_Balikpapan| ,  |Borneo|Borneo_Campaign| , in July 1945, Askin was promoted to Sergeant under Lieutenant Colonel  |Murray_Robson|Murray_Robson| . When hostilities ceased, he unsuccessfully attempted to set up an import business in  |Bandjermasin|Banjarmasin| . Returning to Australia in February 1946, he was demobilised on 22 March. Robin William Askin , 1939–1948 National Archives Service records.       Upon demobilisation, Askin returned to work at the Rural Bank, managing its travel department. However, his interest in politics arose again when he assisted his former commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robson, in retaining his seat of  |Vaucluse|Electoral_District_Of_Vaucluse|  at the  |1947_state_election|1947_New_South_Wales_State_Election|  for the newly formed  |Liberal_Party|Liberal_Party_Of_Australia| , which Askin then joined. Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Askin soon became President of the Liberals  |Manly|Manly,_New_South_Wales|  branch and supported  |Bill_Wentworths|Bill_Wentworth|  successful bid for the new seat of  |Mackellar|Division_Of_Mackellar|  at the  |1949_election|1949_Australian_Federal_Election| .     Askin gained preselection for and won the newly created seat of  |Collaroy|Electoral_District_Of_Collaroy| , located in the  |Northern_Beaches|Northern_Beaches| , at the  |17_June_1950_election|1950_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , gaining 63.69% of the vote.  The Leader of the Liberal Party since 1946,  |Vernon_Treatt|Vernon_Treatt|  led the Liberal/Country Coalition at the election, which resulted in a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament| , with Treatts Coalition gaining 12 seats and a swing of 6.7% for a total of 46 seats. With the  |Labor_Party|Australian_Labor_Party|  also holding 46 seats, the balance of power lay with the two re-elected Independent Labor member,  |James_Geraghty|James_Geraghty|  and  |John_Seiffert|John_Seiffert| , who had been expelled from the party for disloyalty during the previous parliament. Under a legalistic interpretation of the ALP rules, Seiffert was readmitted to the party and, together with the support of Geraghty, Premier  |James_McGirr|James_Mcgirr|  and Labor were able to stay in power.  As the new local member for a constituency covering most of the Northern Beaches from North Manly to Pittwater, Askin protested against the lack of government development and services in the area, such as sewerage, education, and transport.     Labors near-defeat weakened McGirrs position and he was replaced as premier by  |Joseph_Cahill|Joseph_Cahill|  in April 1952. Cahill had won popular support as a vigorous and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales electricity supply and in his first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He appeared decisive and brought order to the governments chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of  |Robert_Menzies|Robert_Menzies| .  All this contributed to Treatts Coalition being defeated at the  |14_February_1953_election|1953_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , with a total loss of ten seats and a swing against them of 7.2%.  Askin retained his seat with 63.35%.        With confidence in his leadership demolished, Treatts Liberal Party descended into factional in-fighting culminating in the resignation of Deputy Leader  |Walter_Howarth|Walter_Howarth|  on 22 July 1954, who publicly announced it on 4 July citing that he felt that Treatt doubted his loyalty. He was replaced by now-Party Whip Askin. Leader quits L.C.P. post , The Argus 5 July 1954 p10 The resignation split the party and sparked a leadership challenge from  |Pat_Morton|Pat_Morton| . At the party meeting on 6 July, Treatt narrowly defeated Morton with 12 votes to 10.  With party support eroded, Treatt did not remain long as leader afterwards. On Friday 6 August 1954, Treatt announced that he would resign as leader.  At the following party meeting, after a deadlocked vote between Askin and Morton, Askin asked his friend Murray Robson to nominate and subsequently he was elected to succeed Treatt.      Like other senior members of the party, after having no conservative government since  |Alexander_Mair|Alexander_Mair|  in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, had little interest in policy and alienated many party members by trying to forge a closer alliance with  |Michael_Bruxners|Michael_Bruxner| |Country_Party|National_Party_Of_Australia_–_Nsw| . Over a year after Robson assumed the leadership, at a party meeting on 20 September 1955, senior party member  |Ken_McCaw|Ken_Mccaw|  moved that the leadership be declared vacant, citing that Robsons leadership lacked the qualities necessary for winning the next election. The motion was carried 15 votes to 5. Morton was then elected unopposed as leader, with Askin remaining as Deputy Leader.      Morton then led the party to defeat at the  |election|1956_New_South_Wales_State_Election|  on 3 March 1956. The Coalition gained six seats, reducing the governments majority from twenty to six. Hancock, The Liberals: The NSW Division 1945–2000, pg 98. Askin retained Collaroy with 70.14%.  Morton again led the opposition to the ballot at the  |21_March_1959_election|1959_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , which resulted in an overall gain of three seats but the loss of two seats to Labor. After counting was finalised the Cahill Government was left with an overall majority of four seats.  Askin retained his seat with 71.09%.        Mortons refusal to give up his many business interests while as leader led many to accuse him of being a part-time leader and together with his second election loss, eroded confidence in his leadership. Editorial , Sydney Morning Herald 19 July 1959 p20 On 14 July 1959, three Liberal MLAs called on Morton to resign, stating that the party needed a full-time leader and that Morton no longer commanded the majority support of his colleagues. Morton refused and instead called an emergency meeting on 17 July to confirm his leadership. Morton May Be Deposed Today , Sydney Morning Herald 17 July 1959 p1 By this time, Askin had emerged as one of the main opponents to his longtime friend and former commander. However, he and the other major challenger to Mortons leadership,  |Eric_Willis|Eric_Willis|  declared that they would only take the leadership if they were given an absolute majority of 28 votes. At the party meeting, a spill motion to remove Morton as leader carried by two votes. Willis then surprised many by deciding not to put his name forward for nomination, leaving Askin to take the leadership unopposed. Willis was eventually elected as Deputy Leader. Hancock, The Liberals: The NSW Division 1945–2000, pg 104. Upon election, Askin declared that One of my main tasks will be to sell our ideas and principles to the working man. Sydney Morning Herald 18 July 1959 p1.      When Premier Cahill died on 22 October 1959, he was replaced by Askins friend and parliamentary contemporary,  |Robert_Bob_Heffron|Robert_Heffron| , which tended to calm his aggression and opposition towards the government. At the  |March_1962_election|1962_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , Labor had been in power for 21 years and Heffron had since been Premier for 2 and a half years. Heffron was 72 at the time of the election and his age and the longevity of the government were made issues by the Askins opposition which described it as being composed of tired old men . The standing of Heffrons government suffered when the electors rejected its proposal to abolish the  |New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council|New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council|  at a  |referendum_in_April_1961|1961_New_South_Wales_Referendum| , being the first time Labor had lost a state electoral poll in 20 years. Askins successful opposition campaign centred on warning of a Labor-dominated single house subject to Communist and Trades Hall influence . Hancock, The Liberals: The NSW Division 1945–2000, pg 105–106.     Labors policies for the election included the establishment of a Department of Industrial Development to reduce unemployment, free school travel, aid to home buyers and commencing the construction of the  |Sydney–Newcastle_Freeway|Pacific_Motorway|  as a toll-road.  By contrast, Askin put forward a wide-ranging program of reform and addressed contentious issues including the introduction of State Aid for private schools, making rent control fairer and the legalisation of off-course betting on horse races. Askin accused the state government of allowing the transport infrastructure of the state to decline and promised to build the Newcastle freeway without a toll, to construct the  |Eastern_Suburbs_Railway|Eastern_Suburbs_Railway_Line|  and to plan for a second crossing of Sydney Harbour. Askin also made promises for more resources in mental health and district hospitals.      Despite these promises, Askin and the new Country Party Leader,  |Charles_Cutler|Charles_Cutler| , lost the election to Heffron, mainly due to the adverse reactions of voters towards the November 1960 horror budget and credit squeeze made by the federal Coalition government under Menzies. The Coalition lost five seats, despite a small swing of 0.16% and the Coalition gaining the support of prominent media businessman,  |Frank_Packer|Frank_Packer| , who helped project the image of Askin and the Liberals as a viable alternative government. Askin retained his seat with 72.53%.      The 1965 campaign against the Labor Government—led since April 1964 by  |Jack_Renshaw|Jack_Renshaw| —a government widely perceived to be tired and devoid of ideas, was notable for being one of Australias first presidential-style campaigns, with Askin being the major focus of campaigning and a main theme of With Askin Youll Get Action . Hancock, The Premiers of New South Wales 1856–2005, pg 352. He received vigorous support from the newspapers and TV stations owned by Packer. At the  |May_1965_election|1965_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , the Liberal/Country Coalition gained 49.8% of the vote to 43.3% to the  |ALP|Australian_Labor_Party| . While the Liberals took only two seats from Labor, Askin got the support of the two independent members,  |Douglas_Darby|Douglas_Darby|   and  |Harold_Coates|Harold_Coates|  , giving him enough support to end Labors 24-year run in power. He officially took office on 1 May, with  |Charles_Cutler|Charles_Cutler|  of the Country Party as Deputy Premier. Hancock, The Premiers of New South Wales 1856–2005, pg 353.       The Askin Government was sworn in by the  |Governor_of_New_South_Wales|Governor_Of_New_South_Wales| ,  |Sir_Eric_Woodward|Eric_Woodward| , on 13 May at  |Government_House|Government_House,_Sydney| . It was the first to be headed by the Liberal Party since the main non-Labor party in the state adopted the Liberal banner; being one of only three Liberals to win power from Labor. Askin, who served as his own  |Treasurer|Treasurer_Of_New_South_Wales| , heavily involved himself in the business of Government, while also maintaining a range of social agendas and regular outings to the racetrack or Rugby League games. Hancock, The Premiers of New South Wales 1856–2005, pg 354. One of the privileges of office was the access to a Ministerial car and personal driver, which became particularly important for Askin, who did not drive. On one occasion when Askin was supposed to drive a new  |Holden|Holden|  from the factory assembly line during a visit, Askin arranged for his driver, Russ Ferguson, to be hidden on the car floor working the controls while Askin held the wheel.     Askins government was marked by strong opposition to an increase in Commonwealth powers, a tough stance on law and order issues, laissez-faire economic policies, and aggressive support for industrial and commercial development. At his first Cabinet meeting, Askin restored direct air services between Sydney and Dubbo, and required  |Joern_Utzon|Joern_Utzon| , the Danish architect then working on the  |Sydney_Opera_House|Sydney_Opera_House| , to provide a final price and completion date for the Opera House, which had gone past the original estimates for both. His Public Works Minister  |Davis_Hughes|Davis_Hughes|  began to assert control over the project and demanded that costs be reined in. This brought him into direct conflict with Utzon and in February 1966, after a bitter standoff and the suspension of progress payments by Hughes, Utzon resigned, sparking a major public outcry. Two weeks after the first Government meeting, the Askin Government abolished the tow-away system for  |Sydney|Sydney|  and  |Newcastle|Newcastle,_New_South_Wales| . In 1966 the  |University_of_New_South_Wales|University_Of_New_South_Wales|  awarded him an honorary  |Doctor_of_Letters|Doctor_Of_Letters|  .       Despite a hostile  |Legislative_Council|New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council| , an extended drought and various industrial disputes, Askin and his Government passed several reforms. Among them were the removal of trading-hours restrictions on small businesses, abolishing juries for motor accident damage cases, extending the hours for liquor trading, thereby bringing an end to the Six oclock swill . The Government also moved into legal and local government reforms, attacking pollution and restoring the previously abolished  |postal_voting|Postal_Voting|  rights in state elections. Askin also addressed the demands of the  |New_England_New_State_Movement|New_England_New_State_Movement|  by holding a referendum in 1967, which was defeated by a large margin. Hancock, The Premiers of New South Wales 1856–2005, pp. 355–356.     Many of his government’s reforms were due to his Minister for Justice,  |John_Maddison|John_Maddison| , and Attorney-General  |Sir_Kenneth_McCaw|Kenneth_Mccaw| , who initiated the establishment of the  |Law_Reform_Commission_of_New_South_Wales|Law_Reform_Commission_Of_New_South_Wales| , the introduction of consumer laws, an ombudsman, legal aid, health labels on cigarette packs, breath-testing of drivers, limits on vehicle emissions, the liberalisation of liquor laws, and compensation for victims of violent crime. There was also a new  |National_Parks_and_Wildlife_Service|National_Parks_And_Wildlife_Service|  to assist environment conservation and protection. Despite these positive reforms, Askins government maintained a brutal prison and corrective regime that was to culminate in the  |Bathurst_Gaol|Bathurst_Correctional_Complex|  riots in 1970 and 1974.       Askin, along with his Minister for Local Government, Pat Morton, oversaw the rapid escalation of building development in inner-city Sydney and the central business district, which followed in the wake of his controversial 1967 abolition of  |Sydney_City_Council|Sydney_City_Council|  and a redistribution of municipal electoral boundaries that was aimed at reducing the power of the rival  |Labor_Party|Australian_Labor_Party| . On its abolition, Morton commented that it was essential for Sydneys progress and replaced the City Council with a Commission, headed by another former Liberal leader,  |Vernon_Treatt|Vernon_Treatt| .      The Sydney metropolitan area at the time was marked by increasing strains on state infrastructure and Askins Governments pro-development stance was largely attributed as an attempt to alleviate these problems. Despite this, the newly established State Planning Authority were continuously criticised for not being totally accountable to the public, particularly as the pro-business Sydney Commissioners worked side-by-side with the Planning authority to increase developments in the Sydney CBD to their highest levels ever, embodied by the construction of the  |MLC_Centre|Mlc_Centre| , the demolition of the  |Theatre_Royal,_Sydney|Theatre_Royal,_Sydney|  and the  |Australia_Hotel|Australia_Hotel| . Other controversial schemes proposed by his government were a massive freeway system that was planned to be driven through the hearts of historic inner-city suburbs including  |Glebe|Glebe,_New_South_Wales|  and  |Newtown|Newtown,_New_South_Wales|  and an equally ambitious scheme of slum clearance that would have brought about the wholescale destruction of the historic areas of  |Woolloomooloo|Woolloomooloo|  and  |The_Rocks|The_Rocks,_New_South_Wales| . This eventually culminated in the 1970s  |Green_ban|Green_Ban|  movement led by Unions Leader  |Jack_Mundey|Jack_Mundey| , to protect the architectural heritage of Sydney.        At the  |24_February_1968_election|1968_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , Askin increased his previously tenuous majority, scoring a six-seat swing against Labors Renshaw and an overall majority of 12 over the Labor Party and the two Independents. Askin retained his seat with 70.97%.  It was the first time since the  |UAP|United_Australia_Party| /Country Coalition won three consecutive elections from 1932 to 1938 that a non-Labor government in New South Wales had been reelected.     In mid-1968 Askin famously became embroiled in a media controversy over the reporting of several words spoken to the  |United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce|United_States_Chamber_Of_Commerce|  lunch in Sydney on 32 July 1968 , in which he spoke of the October 1966 state visit by United States President  |Lyndon_B._Johnson|Lyndon_B._Johnson| . Askin had joined Prime Minister  |Harold_Holt|Harold_Holt| , President Johnson and the American Ambassador,  |Ed_Clark|Edward_Clark| , in a drive through the Sydney CBD. As Johnsons motorcade drove into  |Liverpool_Street|Liverpool_Street,_Sydney| , several anti- |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  protesters, including  |Graeme_Dunstan|Graeme_Dunstan| , threw themselves in front of the car carrying them. As Askin later recalled, a police officer had informed him that some communists were obstructing the route. Askin claimed he had instructed the officer to drag them off. As the car moved on, he then said to Johnson half-jocularly : what I ought to have told him was to ride over them , to which Johnson replied a man after my own heart . At the subsequent luncheon, Askin instead reported that he had said the remark to the police officer, which a journalist attending the event later reported it as Run over the bastards.       As Treasurer, Askin focused on the state budget and on  |Commonwealth-State_financial_relations|Commonwealth-State_Financial_Relations| . His attitude towards the Commonwealth and the Federal was shaped by his first premiers’ conference in 1965 when Prime Minister Menzies negotiated with the Victorian premier  |Henry_Bolte|Henry_Bolte|  to achieve an extra grant of funds for Victoria at the expense of the other states and closed the conference before the other Premiers could object. At subsequent premiers’ conferences he opposed the centralising tendencies of Canberra and became a strong advocate of the rights of the states.     With  |John_Gorton|John_Gorton|  becoming Prime Minister after Holts death, Askin came into conflict with the Commonwealth Government over Gortons determination to maintain federal command over taxation and in June 1968 declared that he could veto any form of state taxation. In late 1969, Askin, with Bolte, organised an emergency premiers conference, without Gorton, to publicise the disadvantages of the States, a move that was partly responsible for the party deposition of Gorton in 1971.     Askin had a greater dislike for Gortons successor,  |William_McMahon|William_Mcmahon|  and received financial support from McMahon only when Askin threatened to release a NSW horror budget that could damage Federal Liberal voting intentions. However, when McMahon lost the 1972 election to Labor Leader  |Gough_Whitlam|Gough_Whitlam| , relations between Sydney and Canberra got even worse. Whitlams centralising economic policies and decision to end legal appeals to the  |Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom|Privy_Council_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  drew criticism from Askin.       At the  |13_February_1971_state_election|1971_New_South_Wales_State_Election| , the Coalition suffered a swing of four seats, but still managed a narrow win against Labor and new leader  |Pat_Hills|Pat_Hills| , taking 49 seats–a bare majority of one–in the expanded 96-seat Legislative Assembly.     Throughout his time as Premier, he was assisted by  |Charles_Cutler|Charles_Cutler|  as Deputy Premier and Leader of the Country Party. Cutler served as Acting Premier at times when Askin was suffering from illness, having suffered two heart attacks in 1969 and 1973. In 1972 the  |Eastern_Orthodox_Church_of_Antioch|Eastern_Orthodox_Church_Of_Antioch|  presented Askin with the Order of St Peter and St Paul for his services to ethnic minorities.     In 1971 Askin changed his name from Robin to Robert by a deed poll. On 1 January 1972, he was appointed a  |Knight_Commander_of_the_Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George|Knight_Commander_Of_The_Order_Of_St_Michael_And_St_George|  .  Later that year, taking advantage of unease at the increasingly erratic Labor government of Gough Whitlam and the increasing economic problems seen to be caused by it, Askin called an early election for 1973. However, a setback arose in the northern Sydney seat of  |Gordon|Electoral_District_Of_Gordon| , when the Liberal member and Education Minister,  |Harry_Jago|Harry_Jago| , failed to nominate his candidacy, thereby losing the seat to the  |Democratic_Labor_Party|Democratic_Labor_Party|  before the election took place. However, the Coalition went to a record fourth win against the ALP, led by  |Pat_Hills|Pat_Hills| , increasing the Liberal/Country majority by four seats and making Askin the only major party leader to win four consecutive terms as Premier until Neville Wran of the ALP. Askin contested the election in  |Pittwater|Electoral_District_Of_Pittwater| , replacing his former seat of Collaroy. In 1973 he was appointed an Officer of the Lebanese  |National_Order_of_the_Cedar|National_Order_Of_The_Cedar| .     His last term in office was marked by tension between the NSW and Victorian Governments and a view that Askin was getting out of touch with the voters. Late in 1974, Askin announced his resignation, and his last intervention was to support his Minister for Lands,  |Thomas_Lewis|Thomas_Lewis| , in his bid to be Askins successor instead of the Deputy Leader and Minister for Education,  |Sir_Eric_Willis|Eric_Willis| . It was reported that Lewis had offered to upgrade Askins knighthood from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, while Willis was uncommitted. Askin retired from politics in January 1975 and was succeeded by Lewis as Premier. Sydney Morning Herald, 12 May 1999, pg 8 On 14 June 1975 he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross, for his service as Premier.  His resignation began a turbulent year for the government. Lewis was ousted in a party room coup by Willis in 1976, but Willis only lasted four months before losing the 1976 election to Labor, ending the longest unbroken run for a non-Labor government since  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .       Askins health declined still further after 1975, and he died of heart failure on 9 September 1981 in  |St_Vincents_Hospital,_Sydney|St_Vincents_Hospital,_Sydney| . The next day, the  Sydney Morning Herald  editorialised that he was one of the ablest, most industrious and colourful political leaders of Australias post-war era .      His state funeral, held on 14  September, was attended by over 1,000 mourners including Prime Minister  |Malcolm_Fraser|Malcolm_Fraser| , Premier  |Neville_Wran|Neville_Wran| ,  |Mervyn_Wood|Mervyn_Wood| , Justice  |Lionel_Murphy|Lionel_Murphy|  and former NSW Labor Premier and former Governor-General  |Sir_William_McKell|William_Mckell| .        There have been persistent allegations that Askin, allegedly assisted by then Police Commissioner  |Norman_Allan|Norman_Allan| , oversaw the creation of a lucrative network of corruption and bribery that involved politicians, public servants and police and the nascent Sydney organised crime syndicates.      When questioned about his wealth, Askin always attributed it to the salary from his high public office, his frugal lifestyle, good investments and canny punting. After his death the  |Australian_Taxation_Office|Australian_Taxation_Office|  audited his estate, and although it made no finding of criminality, it determined that a substantial part of it came from undisclosed income derived from sources other than shares or gambling.     With Askins death, investigative journalists were freed from the threat of legal action under Australias defamation laws. Stories about his reputed corruption were published almost immediately. The most notable of these was the article appeared in the National Times co-written by  |David_Marr|David_Marr|  and  |David_Hickie|David_Hickie| , headlined Askin: friend of organised crime , which was published on the day of Askins funeral in 1981. This was followed by David Hickies book The Prince and The Premier , which detailed Askins long involvement in illegal bookmaking and allegations that he had received substantial and long-running payoffs from organised crime figures.     The allegations of corruption against Askin were revived in 2008 when Alan Saffron, the son of the late Sydney crime boss  |Abe_Saffron|Abe_Saffron| , published a biography of his father in which he alleged that Saffron had paid bribes to major public officials including Askin, former police commissioner  |Norman_Allan|Norman_Allan| , and other leading figures whom he claimed he could not name because they were still alive. Alan Saffron alleged that his father made payments of between A$5000 and $10,000 per week to both men over many years, that Askin and Allan both visited Saffrons office on several occasions, that Allan also visited the Saffron family home, and that Abe Saffron paid for an all-expenses overseas trip for Allan and a young female friend. He also alleged that, later in Askins premiership, Abe Saffron became the bagman for Sydneys illegal liquor and prostitution rackets and most illegal gambling activities, collecting payoffs that were then passed to Askin, Allan and others, in return for which his father was completely protected.
