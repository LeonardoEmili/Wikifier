   The Oaths of Strasbourg  were mutual pledges of allegiance between  |Louis_the_German|Louis_The_German|  , ruler of  |East_Francia|East_Francia| , and his half-brother  |Charles_the_Bald|Charles_The_Bald|  , ruler of  |West_Francia|West_Francia|  made on 12 February 842. Pierre Riche, The Carolingians:The Family who forged Europe, transl. Michael Idomir Allen, , 162. They are written in three different languages:  |Medieval_Latin|Medieval_Latin| ,  |Old_Gallo-Romance|Gallo-Romance|  and  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German| , all in  |Caroline_minuscule|Caroline_Minuscule| .  The Romance passages are generally considered to be the earliest texts in a language that is distinctly Gallo-Romance.       The several pledges were spoken at a strategic meeting on 12 February 842 at  |Strasbourg|Strasbourg| , with the brothers assembled armies in attendance and participating in the ceremonies. In addition to their promised allegiance to each other, Louis and Charles pledged their solidarity to oppose their eldest brother  |Lothair|Lothair_I| , ruler of  |Middle_Francia|Middle_Francia|  and, nominally, emperor of all the  |Carolingian_Empire|Carolingian_Empire| |Frankish_kingdoms|Frankish_Kingdoms|  as well as  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| . Louis spoke his oath in the Romance language of Charles realm, while Charles spoke his oath in lingua teudisca, Germanic, of Louis realm. Pierre Riche, The Carolingians:The Family who forged Europe, 163.     The historical nature of the meeting is made more remarkable by the additional, separate pledges that were scripted for the monarchs armies – in their respective vernaculars – to the effect that, for each soldier : should their own lord-king unilaterally break the oath just pledged , then, each soldier of the oath promises not to help his master against the abused other monarch.          The sole source for the text of the oaths is  |Nithards|Nithard|  Historiae or De dissensionibus filiorum Ludovici pii , where it is found in Chapter V of Book III. Nithards work is preserved in a manuscript from the 10th or 11th century  and the text of the oaths is on folios 12 v -13 r -13 v .     Both kings first made the same preamble speech, which was a detailed complaint against Lothair. Each king then swore his individual  |oath|Oath|  in front of their assembled armies, not in Latin nor in his own language, but in the  |vernacular|Vernacular|  of the others kingdom. Finally, the armies swore separate pledges in their respective languages.     One version of the pledges was written in the  |Rhine_Franconian|Rhine_Franconian|  dialect of  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German| . The second version is in a form of Romance that can be viewed, very approximately, as  |Proto-French|Langues_Doïl| . The preamble was also written in Latin, as were sections to report the ceremonies.       The text is significant to both  |linguists|Historical_Linguistics|  and historians. Linguistically, the text is the first document known to be written in a  |Romance_language|Romance_Language| , and specifically in a form of  |Gallo-Romance|Gallo-Romance| . The documents also shed light on a significant period in the history of the Carolingian-Frankish empire. Historians have long used the coexistence of these bilingual documents to illustrate their theory that, by 842, the empire had begun splitting into separate proto-countries and developing with different languages and customs.     However, others of late have come to favour a different hypothesis: that the Frankish Kingdom comprised several regna  that since ancient times had maintained different customs and dialects. Supporting this theory they note that both  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne|  and  |Louis_the_Pious|Louis_The_Pious|  sent their sons to be raised in the respective regna which they were designated to inherit, in order to better enlist the support of the local populace by becoming familiar with them and their customs.
