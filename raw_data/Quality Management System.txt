A quality management system  is a collection of  |business_process|Business_Process| es focused on consistently meeting customer requirements and enhancing their satisfaction. It is aligned with an organizations purpose and strategic direction . It is expressed as the organizational goals and aspirations, policies, processes, documented information and resources needed to implement and maintain it. Early  |quality_management|Quality_Management|  systems emphasized predictable outcomes of an industrial product production line, using simple statistics and random sampling. By the 20th century, labor inputs were typically the most costly inputs in most industrialized societies, so focus shifted to team cooperation and dynamics, especially the early signaling of problems via a  |continual_improvement|Continual_Improvement|  cycle. In the 21st century, QMS has tended to converge with  |sustainability|Sustainability|  and  |transparency|Transparency|  initiatives, as both investor and customer satisfaction and perceived quality is increasingly tied to these factors. Of QMS regimes, the  |ISO_9000|Iso_9000|  family of standards is probably the most widely implemented worldwide – the  |ISO_19011|Iso_19011| |audit|Audit|  regime applies to both, and deals with quality and sustainability and their integration.     Other QMS, e.g.  |Natural_Step|Natural_Step| , focus on  |sustainability|Sustainability|  issues and assume that other quality problems will be reduced as result of the systematic thinking, transparency, documentation and diagnostic discipline.     The term Quality Management System and the initialism QMS were invented in 1991 by Ken Croucher, a British management consultant working on designing and implementing a generic model of a QMS within the IT industry.        |Quality_objectives|Quality_Objectives|    Quality manual    |Organizational_structure|Organizational_Structure|  and responsibilities    |Data_management|Data_Management|    Processes – including purchasing   Product quality leading to  |customer_satisfaction|Customer_Satisfaction| |Continuous_improvement|Continuous_Improvement|  including  |corrective_and_preventive_action|Corrective_And_Preventive_Action|    Quality instrument          The concept of a quality as we think of it now first emerged from the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| . Previously goods had been made from start to finish by the same person or team of people, with handcrafting and tweaking the product to meet quality criteria. Mass production brought huge teams of people together to work on specific stages of production where one person would not necessarily complete a product from start to finish. In the late 19th century pioneers such as  |Frederick_Winslow_Taylor|Frederick_Winslow_Taylor|  and  |Henry_Ford|Henry_Ford|  recognized the limitations of the methods being used in mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output. Birland established Quality Departments to oversee the quality of production and rectifying of errors, and Ford emphasized standardization of design and component standards to ensure a standard product was produced. Management of quality was the responsibility of the Quality department and was implemented by Inspection of product output to catch defects.     Application of statistical control came later as a result of World War production methods, which were advanced by the work done of  |W._Edwards_Deming|W._Edwards_Deming| , a  |statistician|Statistician| , after whom the  |Deming_Prize|Deming_Prize|  for  |quality|Quality|  is named.  |Joseph_M._Juran|Joseph_M._Juran|  focused more on managing for quality. The first edition of Jurans Quality Control Handbook was published in 1951. He also developed the Jurans trilogy , an approach to cross-functional management that is composed of three managerial processes: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. These functions all play a vital role when evaluating quality.     Quality, as a profession and the managerial process associated with the quality function, was introduced during the second half of the 20th century and has evolved since then. Over this period, few other disciplines have seen as many changes as the quality profession.     The quality profession grew from simple control to engineering, to systems engineering.  |Quality_control|Quality_Control|  activities were predominant in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The 1970s were an era of quality engineering and the 1990s saw quality systems as an emerging field. Like  |medicine|Medicine| ,  |accounting|Accounting| , and  |engineering|Engineering| , quality has achieved status as a recognized profession American Society for Quality Certified Quality Engineer      As Lee and Dale state, there are many organizations that are striving to assess the methods and ways in which their overall productivity, the quality of their products and services and the required operations to achieve them are done.       The two primary, state of the art, guidelines for medical device manufacturer QMS and related services today are the  |ISO_13485|Iso_13485|  standards and the US FDA  |21_CFR_820|21_Cfr_820|  regulations. The two have a great deal of similarity, and many manufacturers adopt QMS that is compliant with both guidelines.     ISO 13485 are harmonized with the European Union  |medical_devices_directive|Medical_Devices_Directive|  as well as the IVD and AIMD directives. The ISO standard is also incorporated in regulations for other jurisdictions such as Japan and Canada .     Quality System requirements for medical devices have been internationally recognized as a way to assure product safety and efficacy and customer satisfaction since at least 1983 and were instituted as requirements in a . The  |U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration|U.S._Food_And_Drug_Administration|  had documented design defects in medical devices that contributed to recalls from 1983 to 1989 that would have been prevented if Quality Systems had been in place. The rule is promulgated at .     According to current  |Good_Manufacturing_Practice|Good_Manufacturing_Practice|  ,  |medical_device|Medical_Device|  manufacturers have the responsibility to use good judgment when developing their quality system and apply those sections of the FDA Quality System Regulation that are applicable to their specific products and operations, in  of the QS regulation. As with GMP, operating within this flexibility, it is the responsibility of each manufacturer to establish requirements for each type or family of devices that will result in devices that are safe and effective, and to establish methods and procedures to design, produce, and distribute devices that meet the quality system requirements.     The FDA has identified in the QS regulation the 7 essential subsystems of a quality system. These subsystems include:     |Design_controls|Design_Controls| ;   Production and process controls   Corrective and preventative actions   Material controls   Records, documents, and change controls   Facilities and equipment controls   all overseen by management and quality audits.     Because the QS regulation covers a broad spectrum of devices and production processes, it allows some leeway in the details of quality system elements. It is left to manufacturers to determine the necessity for, or extent of, some quality elements and to develop and implement procedures tailored to their particular processes and devices. For example, if it is impossible to mix up labels at a manufacturer because there is only one label to each product, then there is no necessity for the manufacturer to comply with all of the GMP requirements under device labeling.     Drug manufactures are regulated under a different section of the  |Code_of_Federal_Regulations|Code_Of_Federal_Regulations|    The  |International_Organization_for_Standardizations|International_Organization_For_Standardization| |ISO_9001:2015|Iso_9001|  series describes standards for a QMS addressing the principles and processes surrounding the  |design|Design| ,  |development,|New_Product_Development|  and delivery of a general  |product|Product|  or  |service|Service| . Organizations can participate in a continuing certification process to ISO 9001:2008 to demonstrate their compliance with the standard, which includes a requirement for continual improvement of the QMS, as well as more foundational QMS components such as failure mode and effects analysis .      .

The Baldrige Award recognizes U.S. organizations for performance excellence based on the . The Criteria address critical aspects of management that contribute to performance excellence: leadership; strategy; customers; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce; operations; and results.

A QMS process is an element of an organizational QMS. The  |ISO_9001:2000|Iso_9000|  standard requires organizations seeking  |compliance|Compliance|  or  |certification|Certification|  to define the processes which form the QMS and the sequence and interaction of these processes.  |Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworth-Heinemann|  and other publishers have offered several books which provide step-by-step guides to those seeking the quality certifications of their products  ,          Examples of such processes include:     order processes,    |production_plans|Production_Plans| ,    |product|Product| /  |service|Service| /  |process|Process_Modeling|  measurements to comply with specific requirements e.g.  |statistical_process_control|Statistical_Process_Control|  and  |measurement_systems_analysis|Measurement_Systems_Analysis| ,    |calibrations|Calibrations| ,    |internal_audits|Internal_Audits| ,    |corrective_actions|Corrective_Actions| ,    |preventive_actions|Preventive_Actions| ,   identification, labeling and control of  |non-conforming|Conformance_Testing| |products|Product|  to prevent its inadvertent use, delivery or processing,    |purchasing|Purchasing|  and related processes such as  |supplier|Distributor|  selection and  |monitoring|Wikt:Monitoring|      ISO9001 requires that the performance of these processes be measured, analyzed and  |continually_improved|Continuous_Improvement| , and the results of this form an input into the  |management|Management| .
