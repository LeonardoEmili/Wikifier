   The politics of Brazil take place in a framework of a  |federal|Federation| |presidential|Presidential_System| |representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy| |republic|Republic| , whereby the  |President|President_Of_Brazil|  is both  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  and  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| , and of a  |multi-party_system|Multi-Party_System| . The political and administrative organization of  |Brazil|Brazil|  comprises the  |federal_government|Federal_Government_Of_Brazil| , the 26  |states|States_Of_Brazil|  and a  |federal_district|Federal_District| , and the  |municipalities|Municipalities_Of_Brazil| .     The federal government exercises control over the  |central_government|Central_Government|  and is divided into three independent branches: executive, legislative and judicial.  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the President, advised by a  |cabinet|Cabinet_Of_Brazil| .  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested upon the  |National_Congress|National_Congress_Of_Brazil| , a two-chamber legislature comprising the  |Federal_Senate|Senate_Of_Brazil|  and the  |Chamber_of_Deputies|Chamber_Of_Deputies_Of_Brazil| .  |Judicial_power|Judicial_Power|  is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the  |Supreme_Federal_Court|Supreme_Federal_Court| , the  |Superior_Court_of_Justice|Superior_Court_Of_Justice|  and other  |Superior_Courts|Federal_Courts_Of_Brazil| , the  |National_Justice_Council|National_Justice_Council|  and the  |Regional_Federal_Courts|Regional_Federal_Courts| .     The states are  |autonomous|Autonomy| |sub-national_entities|Administrative_Division|  with their own governments that, together with the other federal units, form the Federative Republic of Brazil. Currently, Brazil is divided politically and administratively into 27 federal units, being 26 states and one federal district. The executive power is exercised by a  |governor|Governor|  elected to a four-year term. The judiciary is exercised by courts of first and second instance addressing the common justice. Each State has a unicameral  |legislature|Legislature|  with deputies who vote on state laws. The Constitution of Brazil knows also two elements of  |direct_democracy|Direct_Democracy| , stated in Article 14.  Navigator to Direct Democracy  The legislative assemblies supervise the activities of the Executive power of the states and municipalities.     The  |municipalities|Municipalities_Of_Brazil|  are minor federal units of the Federative Republic of Brazil. Each municipality has an autonomous  |local_government|Local_Government| , comprising a  |mayor|Mayor| , directly elected by the people to a four-year term, and a legislative body, also directly elected by the people.     Due to a mix of  |proportional_voting|Proportional_Voting|  , the lack of  |election_threshold|Election_Threshold|  and the cultural aspects of  |Latin_America|Latin_America| n  caudillismo - coronelismo , party politics in Brazil tends to be highly fragmented.                Brazil has had seven  |constitutions|Constitution| :    |Constitution_of_1824|History_Of_The_Constitution_Of_Brazil|  – the first Brazilian constitution, enacted by  |Emperor_Pedro_I|Pedro_I_Of_Brazil| . It was monarchic, hereditary, and highly centralized, permitting suffrage only to property-holders.    |Constitution_of_1891|History_Of_The_Constitution_Of_Brazil|  – the republic was proclaimed in 1889, but a new constitution was not promulgated until 1891. This federalist, democratic constitution was heavily influenced by the  |U.S.|United_States|  model. However, women and illiterates were not permitted to vote.    |Constitution_of_1934|History_Of_The_Constitution_Of_Brazil|  – when  |Getúlio_Vargas|Getúlio_Vargas|  came to power in 1930, he canceled the 1891 constitution and did not permit a new one until 1934. The  |Constitutionalist_Revolution|Constitutionalist_Revolution|  of 1932 forced Vargas to enact a new democratic constitution that permitted womens suffrage. Getúlio Vargas was indirectly elected president by the Constitutional Assembly to a four-year term, beginning in 1933.    |Constitution_of_1937|History_Of_The_Constitution_Of_Brazil|  – Getúlio Vargas suppressed a Communist uprising in 1935 and two years later used it as a pretext to establish autocratic rule. He instituted a corporatist constitution nicknamed the Polish, , written by  |Francisco_Campos|Francisco_Campos| .    |Constitution_of_1946|History_Of_The_Constitution_Of_Brazil|  – in October, 1945, with World War II over, a civil-military coup ousted dictatorial Getúlio Vargas, an Assembly wrote a democratic constitution.    |Constitution_of_1967|History_Of_The_Constitution_Of_Brazil|  – after the 1964 coup dÉtat against  |João_Goulart|João_Goulart| , the military dictatorship passed the Institutional Acts, a supraconstitutional law. This strongly undemocratic constitution simply incorporated these Acts.    |Constitution_of_1988|Constitution_Of_Brazil|  – the progressive redemocratization culminated in the current constitution. Very democratic, it is more expansive than a typical constitution – many statutory acts in other countries are written into this constitution, like Social Security and taxes.                According to sociologist Marcelo Ridenti, Brazilian politics is divided between internationalist  |liberals|Liberalism|  and  |statist|Statism|  nationalists.  Barros, Ana Cláudia. . Terra Magazine. September 17, 2010. The first group consists of politicians arguing that internationalization of the  |economy|Economy_Of_Brazil|  is essential for the development of the country, while the latter rely on  |interventionism|Interventionism| , and protection of  |state_enterprises|Government-Owned_Corporation| . According to Ridenti, who cites the  |Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso|Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso|  administration as an example of the first group and the  |Luiz_Inácio_Lula_da_Silva|Luiz_Inácio_Lula_Da_Silva|  administration as an example of the second, we have it cyclically .     Lulas  |Workers_Party|Workers_Party|  tended to the statist nationalist side, although there are  |privatizing|Privatization|  forces within his party and government, while Cardosos  |Social_Democratic_Party|Brazilian_Social_Democratic_Party|  tended to favor the international private market side by taking  |neoliberal|Neoliberalism|  policies. Lula compares himself with  |Getúlio_Vargas|Getúlio_Vargas| ,  |Juscelino_Kubitscheck|Juscelino_Kubitscheck|  and  |João_Goulart|João_Goulart| , presidents seen as statist nationalists.
