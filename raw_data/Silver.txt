               Silver is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Ag  and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  47. A soft, white, lustrous  |transition_metal|Transition_Metal| , it exhibits the highest  |electrical_conductivity|Electrical_Conductivity| ,  |thermal_conductivity|Thermal_Conductivity| , and  |reflectivity|Reflectivity|  of any  |metal|Metal| . The metal is found in the Earths crust in the pure, free elemental form , as an  |alloy|Alloy|  with  |gold|Gold|  and other metals, and in minerals such as  |argentite|Argentite|  and  |chlorargyrite|Chlorargyrite| . Most silver is produced as a byproduct of  |copper|Copper| , gold,  |lead|Lead| , and  |zinc|Zinc| |refining|Refining| .     Silver has long been valued as a  |precious_metal|Precious_Metal| . Silver metal is used in many  |bullion_coins|Bullion_Coin| , sometimes  |alongside_gold|Bimetallism|  while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a  |native_metal|Native_Metal| .  Its purity is typically measured on a  |per-mille|Per-Mille|  basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as 0.940 fine . As one of the seven  |metals_of_antiquity|Metals_Of_Antiquity| , silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures.     Other than in  |currency|Currency|  and as an  |investment|Investment|  medium , silver is used in  |solar_panels|Solar_Panels| ,  |water_filtration|Water_Filtration| ,  |jewellery|Jewellery| , ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils , in  |electrical_contacts|Electrical_Contact|  and  |conductors|Electrical_Conductor| , in specialized mirrors, window coatings, in  |catalysis|Catalysis|  of chemical reactions, as a colorant in  |stained_glass|Stained_Glass|  and in specialised confectionery. Its compounds are used in  |photographic|Photographic_Film|  and  |X-ray|X-Ray|  film. Dilute solutions of  |silver_nitrate|Silver_Nitrate|  and other silver compounds are used as  |disinfectants|Disinfectant|  and microbiocides , added to  |bandages|Bandage|  and wound-dressings,  |catheters|Catheter| , and other  |medical_instruments|Medical_Instrument| .          Silver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in  |group_11|Group_11_Element|  of the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| ,  |copper|Copper|  and  |gold|Gold| . Its 47 electrons are arranged in the  |configuration|Electron_Configuration|  d 10 5s 1 , similarly to copper and gold ; group 11 is one of the few groups in the  |d-block|D-Block|  which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations. This distinctive electron configuration, with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.     Silver is an extremely soft,  |ductile|Ductility|  and  |malleable|Malleability| |transition_metal|Transition_Metal| , though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a  |face-centered_cubic|Face-Centered_Cubic|  lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1178 Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a  |covalent|Covalent_Bond|  character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low  |hardness|Hardness|  and high ductility of  |single_crystals|Monocrystalline|  of silver.      Silver has a brilliant white metallic luster that can take a high  |polish|Polishing| ,  and which is so characteristic that the name of the metal itself has become a  |colour_name|Silver| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1177 Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p conduction band in silver is large enough that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet| ; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical  |reflectivity|Reflectivity|  than  |aluminium|Aluminium|  at all wavelengths longer than ~450  nm.  At wavelengths shorter than 450  nm, silvers reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310  nm.      Very high electrical and thermal conductivity is common to the elements in group 11, because their single s electron is free and does not interact with the filled d subshell, as such interactions lower electron mobility. Russell AM & Lee KL 2005,  & printsecfrontcover Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals, Wiley-Interscience, New York, . p. 302. The  |electrical_conductivity|Electrical_Conductivity|  of silver is the greatest of all metals, greater even than copper, but it is not widely used for this property because of the higher cost. An exception is in  |radio-frequency_engineering|Radio-Frequency_Engineering| , particularly at  |VHF|Vhf|  and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those  |currents_tend_to_flow_on_the_surface_of_conductors|Skin_Effect|  rather than through the interior. During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in the US,  tons of silver were used in  |electromagnets|Electromagnets|  for enriching  |uranium|Uranium| , mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper.    Pure silver has the highest  |thermal_conductivity|Thermal_Conductivity|  of any metal, although the conductivity of  |carbon|Carbon|   and  |superfluid_helium-4|Superfluid_Helium-4|  are even higher.  Silver also has the lowest  |contact_resistance|Contact_Resistance|  of any metal.     Silver readily forms  |alloys|Alloy|  with copper and gold, as well as  |zinc|Zinc| . Zinc-silver alloys with low zinc concentration may be considered as face-centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver, as the structure of the silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added. Increasing the electron concentration further leads to  |body-centred_cubic|Body-Centred_Cubic|  ,  |complex_cubic|Cubic_Crystal_System|  , and  |hexagonal_close-packed|Hexagonal_Close-Packed|  phases .            Naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable  |isotopes|Isotope| , 107 Ag and 109 Ag, with 107 Ag being slightly more abundant . This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The  |atomic_weight|Atomic_Weight|  is 107.8682  |u|Atomic_Mass_Unit| ;   this value is very important because of the importance of silver compounds, particularly halides, in  |gravimetric_analysis|Gravimetric_Analysis| . Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the  |s-process|S-Process|  , as well as in supernovas via the  |r-process|R-Process|  .      Twenty-eight  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  have been characterized, the most stable being 105 Ag with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 41.29 days, 111 Ag with a half-life of 7.45 days, and 112 Ag with a half-life of 3.13 hours. Silver has numerous  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer| , the most stable being 108m Ag , 110m Ag  and 106m Ag . All of the remaining  |radioactive|Radioactive|  isotopes have half-lives of less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives of less than three minutes.      Isotopes of silver range in  |relative_atomic_mass|Atomic_Weight|  from 92.950  u to 129.950  u ;  the primary  |decay_mode|Decay_Mode|  before the most abundant stable isotope, 107 Ag, is  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  and the primary mode after is  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| . The primary  |decay_products|Decay_Product|  before 107 Ag are  |palladium|Palladium|  isotopes, and the primary products after are  |cadmium|Cadmium|  isotopes.     The palladium  |isotope|Isotope|  107 Pd decays by beta emission to 107 Ag with a half-life of 6.5 million years.  |Iron_meteorites|Iron_Meteorite|  are the only objects with a high-enough palladium-to-silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107 Ag abundance.  |Radiogenic|Radiogenic|  107 Ag was first discovered in the  |Santa_Clara|Santa_Clara,_Durango|  meteorite in 1978.  The discoverers suggest the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small  |planets|Planet|  may have occurred 10 million years after a  |nucleosynthetic|Nucleosynthetic|  event. 107 Pd– 107 Ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the  |accretion|Accretion|  of the  |solar_system|Solar_System|  must reflect the presence of unstable nuclides in the early solar system.           Silver is a rather unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very effective in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is near the bottom of the  |electrochemical_series|Electrochemical_Series|  . In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy , but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold , so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1180 Unlike copper, for which the larger  |hydration_energy|Hydration_Energy|  of Cu 2+ as compared to Cu + is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, with silver this effect is swamped by its larger second ionisation energy. Hence, Ag + is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag 2+ being much less stable as it oxidizes water.     Most silver compounds have significant  |covalent|Covalent_Bond|  character due to the small size and high first ionization energy of silver. Furthermore, silvers Pauling  |electronegativity|Electronegativity|  of 1.93 is higher than that of  |lead|Lead|  , and its  |electron_affinity|Electron_Affinity|  of 125.6  kJ/mol is much higher than that of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and not much less than that of  |oxygen|Oxygen|  . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1176 Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable  |organometallic_compounds|Organometallic_Compound| , forming linear complexes showing very low  |coordination_numbers|Coordination_Number|  like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide Lidin RA 1996, Inorganic substances handbook, Begell House, New York, . p. 5 as well as  |Zintl_phases|Zintl_Phase|  like the  |post-transition_metals|Post-Transition_Metal| . Goodwin F, Guruswamy S, Kainer KU, Kammer C, Knabl W, Koethe A, Leichtfreid G, Schlamp G, Stickler R & Warlimont H 2005, Noble metals and noble metal alloys, in Springer Handbook of Condensed Matter and Materials Data, W Martienssen & H Warlimont , Springer, Berlin, pp.  329–406, . p. 341 Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable even in the absence of  |π-acceptor_ligands|Pi_Backbonding| .     Silver does not react with air, even at red heat, and thus was considered by  |alchemists|Alchemist|  as a  |noble_metal|Noble_Metal|  along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper  and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with  |sulfur|Sulfur|  and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air to form the black  |silver_sulfide|Silver_Sulfide|  . Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, with the exception of  |fluorine|Fluorine|  gas, with which it forms the  |difluoride|Silver_Fluoride| . While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| , as well as dilute or concentrated  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| . In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of  |hydrogen_peroxide|Hydrogen_Peroxide| , silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of  |cyanide|Cyanide| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1179     The three main forms of deterioration in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of  |silver_chloride|Silver_Chloride|  due to long-term immersion in salt water, as well as reaction with  |nitrate|Nitrate|  ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly from the surface of the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.  in Corrosion – Artifacts. NACE Resource Center     Silver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as  |potassium_permanganate|Potassium_Permanganate|   and  |potassium_dichromate|Potassium_Dichromate|  , and in the presence of  |potassium_bromide|Potassium_Bromide|  . These compounds are used in photography to  |bleach|Bleach|  silver images, converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with  |thiosulfate|Thiosulfate|  or redeveloped to  |intensify|Potassium_Dichromatephotography|  the original image. Silver forms  |cyanide|Cyanide|  complexes  that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions. Silver cyanide solutions are used in  |electroplating|Electroplating|  of silver.      The common  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  of silver are : +1 ; +2 ; and even very rarely +3 .  The +1 state is by far the most common, followed by the easily reducible +2 state. The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as  |fluorine|Fluorine|  or  |peroxodisulfate|Peroxodisulfate| , and some silver compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1188 Indeed, silver fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidizing agent,  |krypton_difluoride|Krypton_Difluoride| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 903            Silver and gold have rather low  |chemical_affinities|Chemical_Affinity|  for oxygen, lower than copper, and it is therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable. Soluble silver salts precipitate dark-brown  |silver_oxide|Silver_Oxide| , Ag 2 O, upon the addition of alkali. Silver oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160  °C. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1181–82 This and other silver compounds may be oxidized by the strong oxidizing agent  |peroxodisulfate|Peroxodisulfate|  to black AgO, a mixed  |silver_oxide|Silver_Oxide|  of formula Ag I Ag III O 2 . Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag 2 O 3 and Ag 3 O 4 , are also known, as is Ag 3 O which behaves as a metallic conductor.      |Silver_sulfide|Silver_Sulfide| , Ag 2 S, is very readily formed from its constituent elements and is the cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It may also be formed from the reaction of  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  with silver metal or aqueous Ag + ions. Many non-stoichiometric  |selenides|Selenide|  and  |tellurides|Telluride|  are known; in particular, AgTe ~3 is a low-temperature  |superconductor|Superconductor| .             The only known dihalide of silver is  |the_difluoride|Silver_Fluoride| , AgF 2 , which can be obtained from the elements under heat. A strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent, silver fluoride is often used to synthesize  |hydrofluorocarbons|Hydrofluorocarbon| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1183–85     In stark contrast to this, all four silver halides are known. The  |fluoride|Silver_Fluoride| ,  |chloride|Silver_Chloride| , and  |bromide|Silver_Bromide|  have the sodium chloride structure, but the  |iodide|Silver_Iodide|  has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic  |zinc_blende|Zinc_Blende|  structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for  |ligand-metal_charge_transfer|Charge-Transfer_Complex|  decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small that it has a considerable  |solvation|Solvation|  energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric  |analytical|Wet_Chemistry|  methods. All four are  |photosensitive|Photosensitive|  , especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography. The reaction involved is: Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1185–87   :X − + hν → X + e −   :Ag + + e − → Ag     The process is not reversible because the silver atom liberated is typically found at a  |crystal_defect|Crystal_Defect|  or an impurity site, so that the electrons energy is lowered enough that it is trapped .          White  |silver_nitrate|Silver_Nitrate| , AgNO 3 , is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called lunar caustic because silver was called luna by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver was associated with the moon.  It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the heavier silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in  |organic_synthesis|Organic_Synthesis| , e.g. for  |deprotection|Deprotection|  and oxidations. Ag + binds  |alkenes|Alkene|  reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting  |adduct|Adduct|  can be decomposed with  |ammonia|Ammonia|  to release the free alkene.      Yellow  |silver_carbonate|Silver_Carbonate| , Ag 2 CO 3 can be easily prepared by reacting aqueous solutions of  |sodium_carbonate|Sodium_Carbonate|  with a deficiency of silver nitrate.  Its principal use is for the production of silver powder for use in microelectronics. It is reduced with  |formaldehyde|Formaldehyde| , producing silver free of alkali metals: Andreas Brumby et al. Silver, Silver Compounds, and Silver Alloys in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2008.    :Ag 2 CO 3 + CH 2 O → 2 Ag + 2 CO 2 + H 2     Silver carbonate is also used as a  |reagent|Reagent|  in organic synthesis such as the  |Koenigs-Knorr_reaction|Koenigs-Knorr_Reaction| . In the  |Fétizon_oxidation|Fétizon_Oxidation| , silver carbonate on  |celite|Celite|  acts as an  |oxidising_agent|Oxidising_Agent|  to form  |lactones|Lactone|  from  |diols|Diols| . It is also employed to convert  |alkyl|Alkyl|  bromides into  |alcohols|Alcohol| .      |Silver_fulminate|Silver_Fulminate| , AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive  |explosive|Explosive|  used in  |percussion_caps|Percussion_Cap| , is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of  |ethanol|Ethanol| . Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are  |silver_azide|Silver_Azide| , AgN 3 , formed by reaction of  |silver_nitrate|Silver_Nitrate|  with  |sodium_azide|Sodium_Azide| ,  and  |silver_acetylide|Silver_Acetylide| , Ag 2 C 2 , formed when silver reacts with  |acetylene|Acetylene|  gas in  |ammonia|Ammonia|  solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.     : 2  → 3  + 2 Ag          Silver complexes tend to be similar to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper. For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver with alkaline  |peroxodisulfate|Peroxodisulfate| . The yellow diamagnetic − is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.     Silver complexes are more common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper complexes, they are usually square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag 2+ , produced by oxidation of Ag + by ozone, is a very strong oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilized in  |phosphoric_acid|Phosphoric_Acid|  due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic  |amines|Amine| , such as 2+ and 2+ : these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. 2− is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver complexes with N- or O-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1189     By far the most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag + cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu + and Au + , as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I − . Ag + forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag + cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form + ; silver salts are dissolved in photography due to the formation of the thiosulfate complex 3− ; and  |cyanide|Cyanide|  extraction for silver works by the formation of the complex − . Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer ; silver  |thiocyanate|Thiocyanate|  has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp 3 - |hybridized|Orbital_Hybridization|  sulfur atom.  |Chelating_ligands|Chelating_Ligand|  are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral  |diphosphine|Diphosphine|  and  |diarsine|Diarsine|  complexes + . Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1195–96          Under standard conditions, silver does not form simple carbonyls, due to the weakness of the Ag–C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6–15  K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag 3 , which dimerizes at 25–30  K, probably by forming Ag–Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with  |alkenes|Alkene|  and  |alkynes|Alkyne|  are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the  |platinum|Platinum|  complexes : they are also quite unsymmetrical, showing the weak π bonding in group 11. Ag–C σ bonds may also be formed by silver, like copper and gold, but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver are even less stable than those of copper . For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe and CuMe as well as those of PhAg and PhCu . Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1199–200     The C–Ag bond is stabilized by  |perfluoroalkyl|Perfluoroalkane|  ligands, for example in AgCF 2 .  Alkenylsilver compounds are also more stable than their alkylsilver counterparts.  Silver- |NHC_complexes|Transition_Metal_Carbene_Complex|  are easily prepared, and are commonly used to prepare other NHC complexes by displacing labile ligands. For example, the reaction of the bissilver complex with  |bispalladium_dichloride|Bispalladium_Dichloride|  or  |chloridogold|Chloridogold|      :          Silver forms  |alloys|Alloy|  with most other elements on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| ,  |lithium|Lithium| , and  |beryllium|Beryllium| , are very miscible with silver in the condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14  have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the  |eutectic_mixture|Eutectic_Mixture|  is used in vacuum  |brazing|Brazing| . The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry comes from the fact that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture . Ullmann, pp. 54–61     Most other binary alloys are of little use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver– |cadmium|Cadmium|  alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental  |amalgams|Amalgam|  are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys are very important in jewellery and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium– |indium|Indium|  is useful in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor|  because of its high thermal neutron capture  |cross-section|Cross_Section| , good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.       The word silver appears in  |Anglo-Saxon|Old_English_Language|  in various spellings, such as seolfor and siolfor. A similar form is seen throughout the  |Germanic_languages|Germanic_Languages|  . The chemical symbol Ag is from the  |Latin|Latin|  word for silver , argentum , from the  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European|  root h₂erǵ- , meaning white or shining : this was the usual Proto-Indo-European word for the metal, whose reflexes are missing in Germanic and  |Balto-Slavic|Balto-Slavic| . The Balto-Slavic words for silver are quite similar to the Germanic ones  and they may have a common origin, although this is uncertain: some scholars have suggested the  |Akkadian|Akkadian_Language|  sarpu refined silver as this origin, related to the word sarapu to refine or smelt .                Silver was one of the seven  |metals_of_antiquity|Metals_Of_Antiquity|  that were known to prehistoric humans and whose discovery is thus lost to history. Weeks, p. 4 In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the  |elemental_form|Native_Metal|  in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of  |money|Money|  as opposed to simple bartering. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1173–74 However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of  |metallurgy|Metallurgy|  on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money.  Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold. For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC: Weeks, pp. 14–19 the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the  |silver_chloride|Silver_Chloride|  produced to the metal.     The situation changed with the discovery of  |cupellation|Cupellation| , a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores. While  |slag|Slag|  heaps found in  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  and on the islands of the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea|  indicate that silver was being separated from  |lead|Lead|  as early as the  |4th_millennium_BC|4Th_Millennium_Bc| , and one of the earliest silver extraction centres in Europe was  |Sardinia|Sardinia|  in the early  |Chalcolithic_period|Chalcolithic_Period| ,  these techniques did not spread widely until later,   when it spread throughout the region and beyond. The origins of silver production in  |India|India| ,  |China|China| , and  |Japan|Japan|  were almost certainly equally ancient, but are not well-documented due to their great age.        When the  |Phoenicia|Phoenicia| ns first came to what is now  |Spain|Spain| , they obtained so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships, and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead. By the time of the Greek and Roman civilizations, silver coins were a staple of the economy: the Greeks were already extracting silver from  |galena|Galena|  by the 7th century BC, and the rise of  |Athens|Athens|  was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at  |Laurium|Laurium| , from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300 BC.  The stability of the  |Roman_currency|Roman_Currency|  relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, mostly from Spain, which  |Roman_miners|Roman_Metallurgy|  produced on a scale unparalleled before the  |discovery_of_the_New_World|Discovery_Of_The_New_World| . Reaching a peak production of 200 tonnes per year, an estimated silver stock of 10000 tonnes circulated in the  |Roman_economy|Roman_Economy|  in the middle of the second century AD, five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to  |medieval_Europe|Early_Middle_Ages|  and the  |Abbasid_Caliphate|Abbasid_Caliphate|  around AD 800.   The Romans also recorded the extraction of silver in central and northern Europe in the same time period. This production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the Roman Empire, not to resume until the time of  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in  |Bohemia|Bohemia| ,  |Saxony|Saxony| ,  |Erzgebirge|Erzgebirge| ,  |Alsace|Alsace| , the  |Lahn|Lahn|  region,  |Siegerland|Siegerland| ,  |Silesia|Silesia| ,  |Hungary|Hungary| ,  |Norway|Norway| ,  |Steiermark|Steiermark| ,  |Salzburg|Salzburg| , and the southern  |Black_Forest|Black_Forest| . Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, but a few of them remained active until the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50  tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead  |cupellation|Cupellation|  technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.      With the discovery of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around the beginning of the 18th century, particularly  |Peru|Peru| ,  |Bolivia|Bolivia| ,  |Chile|Chile| , and  |Argentina|Argentina|  Much of this silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese. A Portuguese merchant in 1621 noted that silver wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural center.  Still, much of it went to Spain, allowing Spanish rulers to pursue military and political ambitions in both Europe and the Americas. New World mines, concluded several historians, supported the Spanish empire.      In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly  |Canada|Canada| ,  |Mexico|Mexico| , and  |Nevada|Nevada|  in the  |United_States|United_States| |Siberia|Siberia|  and the  |Russian_Far_East|Russian_Far_East|  as well as in  |Australia|Australia|  were mined.  |Poland|Poland|  emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after the discovery of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.          Silver plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore. The Greek poet  |Hesiods|Hesiod|   Works and Days  lists different  |ages_of_man|Ages_Of_Man|  named after metals like gold, silver, bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity.  |Joseph_Eddy_Fontenrose|Joseph_Eddy_Fontenrose| Work, Justice, and Hesiods Five Ages. In: Classical Philology. V. 69, Nr. 1, 1974, p. 1–16.  |Ovids|Ovid|   Metamorphoses  contains another retelling of the story, containing an illustration of silvers metaphorical use of signifying the second-best in a series, better than bronze but worse than gold:      In folklore, silver was commonly thought to have mystic powers: for example, a  |bullet|Bullet|  cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a  |werewolf|Werewolf| ,  |witch|Witch| , or other  |monsters|Monster| .    From this the idiom of a  |silver_bullet|Silver_Bullet|  developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed  |software_engineering|Software_Engineering|  paper  No Silver Bullet .  Other powers attributed to silver include detection of poison and facilitation of passage into the  |mythical_realm_of_fairies|Fairyland| .     Silver production has also inspired figurative language. Clear references to cupellation occur throughout the  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament|  of the  |Bible|Bible| , such as in  |Jeremiahs|Jeremiah|  rebuke to Judah: The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them. Jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver, exemplifying the malleability and ductility of the metal: Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.     Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom  |thirty_pieces_of_silver|Wikt:Thirty_Pieces_Of_Silver| , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe  |Judas_Iscariot|Judas_Iscariot|  is said in the  |New_Testament|New_Testament|  to have taken from Jewish leaders in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  to turn  |Jesus_of_Nazareth|Jesus|  over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.  Ethically, silver also symbolizes greed and degradation of consciousness; this is the negative aspect, the perverting of its value.              The abundance of silver in the Earths crust is 0.08   |parts_per_million|Parts_Per_Million| , almost exactly the same as that of  |mercury|Mercury| . It mostly occurs in  |sulfide|Sulfide|  ores, especially  |acanthite|Acanthite|  and  |argentite|Argentite| , Ag 2 S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain  |native|Native_Metal|  silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to  |chlorargyrite|Chlorargyrite|  , AgCl, which is prevalent in  |Chile|Chile|  and  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1174–67 Most other silver minerals are silver  |pnictides|Pnictide|  or  |chalcogenides|Chalcogenide| ; they are generally lustrous semiconductors. Most true silver deposits, as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals, came from  |Tertiary_period|Tertiary_Period|  vulcanism. Ullmann, pp. 21–22     The principal sources of silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from  |Peru|Peru| ,  |Bolivia|Bolivia| ,  |Mexico|Mexico| ,  |China|China| ,  |Australia|Australia| ,  |Chile|Chile| ,  |Poland|Poland|  and  |Serbia|Serbia| . Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, and are still major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are  |Cannington|Cannington_Mine|  ,  |Fresnillo|Mina_Proaño|  ,  |San_Cristóbal|San_Cristóbal_Mine|  ,  |Antamina|Antamina_Mine|  ,  |Rudna|Rudna_Mine|  , and  |Penasquito|Peñasquito_Polymetallic_Mine|  .  Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama , Navidad , Jaunicipio , Malku Khota ,  and Hackett River . In  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| ,  |Tajikistan|Mining_In_Tajikistansilver|  is known to have some of the largest silver deposits in the world.      Silver is usually found in nature combined with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally in the form of  |sulfides|Sulfides|  such as  |galena|Galena|  or  |cerussite|Cerussite|  . So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then  |cupellation|Cupellation|  of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Kassianidou, V. 2003. Early Extraction of Silver from Complex Polymetallic Ores, in Craddock, P.T. and Lang, J Mining and Metal production through the Ages. London, British Museum Press: 198–206 Lead melts at 327  °C, lead oxide at 888  °C and silver melts at 960  °C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960  °C to 1000  °C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to  |lead_monoxide|Lead_Oxide| , then known as  |litharge|Litharge| , which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by  |capillary_action|Capillary_Action|  into the hearth linings. Craddock, P.T. . Early metal mining and production.

Pernicka, E., Rehren, Th., Schmitt-Strecker, S. 1998. Late Uruk silver production by cupellation at Habuba Kabira, Syria in Metallurgica Antiqua : in honour of Hans-Gert Bachmann and Robert Maddin by Bachmann, H.G, Maddin, Robert, Rehren, Thilo, Hauptmann, Andreas, Muhly, James David, Deutsches Bergbau-Museum: 123–34.   :  + 2 +  → 2 + Ag     Today, silver metal is primarily produced instead as a secondary byproduct of  |electrolytic|Electrolysis|  refining of copper, lead, and zinc, and by application of the  |Parkes_process|Parkes_Process|  on lead bullion from ore that also contains silver. In such processes, silver follows the non-ferrous metal in question through its concentration and smelting, and is later purified out. For example, in copper production, purified copper is  |electrolytically|Electrolysis|  deposited on the cathode, while the less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under the anode as the so-called anode slime . This is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute  |sulfuric|Sulfuric|  acid and heating with lime or silica flux, before the silver is purified to over 99.9% purity via electrolysis in  |nitrate|Nitrate|  solution.     Commercial-grade fine silver is at least 99.9% pure, and purities greater than 99.999% are available. In 2014, Mexico was the top producer of silver , followed by China and Peru .             The earliest known coins were minted in the kingdom of  |Lydia|Lydia|  in  |Asia_Minor|Anatolia|  around 600 BC.  The coins of Lydia were made of  |electrum|Electrum| , which is a naturally occurring  |alloy|Alloy|  of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time,  |silver_standards|Silver_Standard| , in which the standard economic  |unit_of_account|Unit_Of_Account|  is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable  |silver_coins|Silver_Coin|  through the centuries include the  |Greek_drachma|Greek_Drachma| ,  the Roman  |denarius|Denarius| , Crawford, Michael H. . Roman Republican Coinage, Cambridge University Press, 2 Volumes.  the Islamic  |dirham|Dirham| ,  Oxford English Dictionary , 1st edition,  the  |karshapana|Karshapana|  from ancient India and  |rupee|Rupee|  from the time of the  |Mughal_Empire|Mughal_Empire|  ,  and the  |Spanish_dollar|Spanish_Dollar| .       The ratio between the amount of silver used for coinage and that used for other purposes has fluctuated greatly over time; for example, in wartime, more silver tends to have been used for coinage to finance the war. Ullmann, pp. 63–65     Today, silver bullion has the  |ISO_4217|Iso_4217|  currency code XAG, one of only four  |precious_metals|Precious_Metal|  to have one .  Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut  |blanks|Planchet|  from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.       As of July 2018, silver is valued at around $495 per kilogram, or about $15.5 per ounce.      Silver prices are normally quoted in  |Troy_ounces|Troy_Weight| . One troy ounce is equal to 31.1034 grams. In 2015 China reverted to the metric system and currently prices silver in grams.  The London silver fix is published once daily at noon London time. This price is determined by several major international banks and is used by  |London_bullion_market|London_Bullion_Market|  members for trading that day. Prices are most commonly shown as the  |United_States_dollar|United_States_Dollar|  , the  |Pound_sterling|Pound_Sterling|  , and the  |Euro|Euro|  .                 The major use of silver besides coinage throughout most of history was in the manufacture of  |jewellery|Jewellery|  and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include  |table_silver|Household_Silver|  for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties.  |Western_concert_flutes|Western_Concert_Flute|  are usually plated with or made out of  |sterling_silver|Sterling_Silver| ; Ullmann, pp. 65–67 in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by  |electroplating|Electroplating| . Silver-plated glass is used for mirrors,  |vacuum_flasks|Vacuum_Flask| , and Christmas tree decorations.     Because pure silver is very soft, most silver used for these purposes is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of silver in the presence of  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly;  |base_metals|Base_Metal|  like  |zinc|Zinc| ,  |cadmium|Cadmium| ,  |silicon|Silicon| , and  |germanium|Germanium|  do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently. A simple chemical approach to removal of the sulfide tarnish is to bring silver items into contact with aluminium foil whilst immersed in water containing a conducting salt, such as sodium chloride.            In medicine, silver is incorporated into wound dressings and used as an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing  |silver_sulfadiazine|Silver_Sulfadiazine|  or  |silver_nanomaterials|Silver_Nanoparticles|  are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as  |urinary_catheters|Urinary_Catheter|   and in  |endotracheal_breathing_tubes|Endotracheal_Tube|  .   The silver  |ion|Ion|  is  |bioactive|Biological_Activity|  and in sufficient  |concentration|Concentration|  readily kills  |bacteria|Bacteria|   in vitro . Silver ions interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, and synthesise cell walls; these ions also bond with the bacterias genetic material. Silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer.  Bacteria can, however, develop resistance to the antimicrobial action of silver. Silver compounds are taken up by the body like  |mercury|Mercury|  compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry. Ullmann, pp. 67–71  |Silver_diammine_fluoride|Silver_Diammine_Fluoride| , the fluoride salt of a  |coordination_complex|Coordination_Complex|  with the formula , is a topical  |medicament|Medicament|  used to treat and prevent  |dental_caries|Dental_Caries|  and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.        Silver is very important in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for  |RF|Radio_Frequency| ,  |VHF|Very_High_Frequency| , and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as  |cavity_filters|Rf_And_Microwave_Filtercavity_Filters|  where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%.  |Printed_circuits|Printed_Circuit_Board|  and  |RFID|Rfid|  antennas are made with silver paints,  Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components. Ullmann, pp. 71–78       Silver-containing  |brazing|Brazing|  alloys are used for brazing metallic materials, mostly  |cobalt|Cobalt| ,  |nickel|Nickel| , and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals. The basic components are silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium,  |manganese|Manganese| , and  |phosphorus|Phosphorus| . Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage. Ullmann, pp. 78–81       Silver is useful in the manufacture of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver  |crucibles|Crucible|  are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with  |fluorine|Fluorine| . Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment. Ullmann, pp. 81–82       Silver metal is a good catalyst for  |oxidation|Oxidation|  reactions; in fact it is somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al 2 O 3 or silicates is a catalyst for the oxidation of  |ethylene|Ethylene|  to  |ethylene_oxide|Ethylene_Oxide|  at 230–270  °C. Dehydrogenation of  |methanol|Methanol|  to  |formaldehyde|Formaldehyde|  is conducted at 600–720  °C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of  |isopropanol|Isopropanol|  to  |acetone|Acetone| . In the gas phase,  |glycol|Glycol|  yields  |glyoxal|Glyoxal|  and  |ethanol|Ethanol|  yields  |acetaldehyde|Acetaldehyde| , while organic  |amines|Amine|  are dehydrated to  |nitriles|Nitrile| .       The photosensitivity of the silver halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases. Ullmann, p. 82     The use of silver nitrate and silver halides in photography has rapidly declined with the advent of digital technology. From the peak global demand for photographic silver in 1999  the market contracted almost 70% by 2013.             Nanosilver particles, between 10 and 100  nanometres in size, are used in many applications. They are used in conductive inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals in much the same way as larger silver particles. In addition, according to the , silver nanoparticles are used both in pigments, as well as cosmetics.            Pure silver metal is used as a food colouring. It has the  |E174|E_Number|  designation and is approved in the  |European_Union|European_Union| .  Traditional Pakistani and Indian dishes sometimes include decorative silver foil known as  vark ,  and in various other cultures, silver  dragée  are used to decorate cakes, cookies, and other dessert items.       |Photochromic_lens|Photochromic_Lens| es include silver halides, so that ultraviolet light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films are used in radiation detectors.  |Zeolite|Zeolite|  sieves incorporating Ag + ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption.  |Colloidal_silver|Colloidal_Silver|  is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it has the advantage of not giving off a smell like  |hypochlorite|Hypochlorite|  treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small  |silver_iodide|Silver_Iodide|  crystals are used in  |cloud_seeding|Cloud_Seeding|  to cause rain. Ullmann, pp. 83–84          Silver compounds have low toxicity compared to those of most other  |heavy_metals|Heavy_Metals| , as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by  |metallothionein|Metallothionein| . However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in  |gastroenteritis|Gastroenteritis| ,  |diarrhoea|Diarrhoea| , falling  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure| , cramps, paralysis, and  |respiratory_arrest|Respiratory_Arrest| . Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience  |anaemia|Anaemia| , slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with  |colloidal_silver|Colloidal_Silver|  have been observed to develop localised tumours.  |Parenterally|Route_Of_Administration|  admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Ullmann, pp. 88–91 Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts and those of the other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.     In large doses, silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into the  |circulatory_system|Circulatory_System|  and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to  |argyria|Argyria| , which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and  |mucous_membranes|Mucous_Membrane| . Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a persons health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for  |cyanosis|Cyanosis| .     Metallic silver, like copper, is an antibacterial agent, which was known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the  |oligodynamic_effect|Oligodynamic_Effect|  by  |Carl_Nägeli|Carl_Nägeli| . Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1  milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due to the formation of silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of  |sulfur|Sulfur|  due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.     Some silver compounds are very explosive, such as the nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver  |amide|Amide| , and silver fulminate, as well as  |silver_acetylide|Silver_Acetylide| ,  |silver_oxalate|Silver_Oxalate| , and silver oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and  |acetylene|Acetylene|  should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as  |silver_chlorate|Silver_Chlorate|.
