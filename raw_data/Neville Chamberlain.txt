         Arthur Neville Chamberlain   was a British  |Conservative|Conservative_Party|  statesman who served as  |Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  from May 1937 to May 1940. Chamberlain is best known for his foreign policy of  |appeasement|Appeasement| , and in particular for his signing of the  |Munich_Agreement|Munich_Agreement|  in 1938, conceding the German-speaking  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|  region of  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  to  |Germany|Nazi_Germany| . When  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler| |invaded_Poland|Invasion_Of_Poland| , the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, and Chamberlain led Britain through the  |first_eight_months|Phoney_War|  of the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| .     After working in business and local government, and after a short spell as  |Director_of_National_Service|Director_Of_National_Service|  in 1916 and 1917, Chamberlain followed his father,  |Joseph_Chamberlain|Joseph_Chamberlain| , and older half-brother,  |Austen_Chamberlain|Austen_Chamberlain| , in becoming a Member of Parliament in the  |1918_general_election|1918_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  for the new  |Birmingham_Ladywood|Birmingham_Ladywood_Elections_In_The_1910S|  division at the age of 49. He declined a junior ministerial position, remaining a  |backbencher|Backbencher|  until 1922. He was rapidly promoted in 1923 to  |Minister_of_Health|Secretary_Of_State_For_Health|  and then  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| . After a short-lived  |Labour|Labour_Party| -led government, he returned as Minister of Health, introducing a range of reform measures from 1924 to 1929. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the  |National_Government|Uk_National_Government|  in 1931.     When  |Stanley_Baldwin|Stanley_Baldwin|  retired in May 1937, Chamberlain took his place as Prime Minister. His premiership was dominated by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among the British at the time. When Hitler continued his aggression, Chamberlain pledged Britain to defend Polands independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought his country into war when Germany and the  |Soviet_Union|Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|  invaded Poland in 1939. Chamberlain resigned the premiership on 10 May 1940 as the  |Allies_were_being_forced_to_retreat_from_Norway|Norwegian_Campaign| , as he believed that a government supported by all parties was essential, and the Labour and  |Liberal|Liberal_Party|  parties would not join a government he headed. He was succeeded by  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  but remained very well regarded in Parliament, especially among Conservatives. Before ill health forced him to resign, he was an important member of Churchills  |war_cabinet|Churchill_War_Ministry|  as  |Lord_President_of_the_Council|Lord_President_Of_The_Council| , heading the Cabinet in the new premiers absence. Chamberlain died of cancer six months after leaving the premiership.     Chamberlains reputation remains controversial among historians, the initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as  Guilty Men , published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlains death held similar views, led by Churchill in  The Gathering Storm . Some later historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the  |Thirty_Year_Rule|Thirty-Year_Rule|  and arguing that going to war with Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was unprepared. Nonetheless, Chamberlain is still  |unfavourably_ranked|Historical_Rankings_Of_Prime_Ministers_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  amongst British Prime Ministers.                       Chamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the  |Edgbaston|Edgbaston|  district of  |Birmingham|Birmingham| . He was the only son of the second marriage of  |Joseph_Chamberlain|Joseph_Chamberlain| , who later became  |Mayor_of_Birmingham|List_Of_Lord_Mayors_Of_Birmingham|  and a Cabinet minister. His mother was Florence Kenrick, cousin to  |William_Kenrick_MP|William_Kenrick| ; she died when he was a small boy. Joseph Chamberlain had had another son,  |Austen_Chamberlain|Austen_Chamberlain| , by his first marriage. Neville Chamberlain was educated at home by his elder sister  |Beatrice_Chamberlain|Beatrice_Chamberlain|  and later at  |Rugby_School|Rugby_School| . Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to  |Mason_College|Mason_College| . Neville Chamberlain had little interest in his studies there, and in 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months he became a salaried employee.     In an effort to recoup diminished family fortunes, Joseph Chamberlain sent his younger son to establish a  |sisal|Sisal|  plantation on  |Andros_Island_in_the_Bahamas|Andros,_Bahamas| . Neville Chamberlain spent six years there but the plantation was a failure, and Joseph Chamberlain lost £50,000.     On his return to England, Neville Chamberlain entered business, purchasing Hoskins & Company, a manufacturer of metal ship berths. Chamberlain served as managing director of Hoskins for 17  years during which time the company prospered. He also involved himself in civic activities in Birmingham. In 1906, as Governor of Birminghams General Hospital, and along with no more than fifteen other dignitaries, Chamberlain became a founding member of the national United Hospitals Committee of the  |British_Medical_Association|British_Medical_Association| .       At forty, Chamberlain was expecting to remain a bachelor, but in 1910 he fell in love with  |Anne_Cole|Anne_Chamberlain| , a recent connection by marriage, and married her the following year. They met through his Aunt Lilian, the Canadian-born widow of  |Joseph_Chamberlains|Joseph_Chamberlain|  brother Herbert, who in 1907 had married Anne Coles uncle  |Alfred_Clayton_Cole|Alfred_Clayton_Cole| , a director of the  |Bank_of_England|Bank_Of_England| .     She encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and was to be his constant companion, helper, and trusted colleague, fully sharing his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as an MP. The couple had a son and a daughter.       Chamberlain initially showed little interest in politics, though his father and half-brother were in Parliament. During the  |Khaki_election|1900_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlains  |Liberal_Unionists|Liberal_Unionist_Party| . The Liberal Unionists were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them under the name Unionist Party , which in 1925 became known as the Conservative and Unionist Party . In 1911, Neville Chamberlain successfully stood as a Liberal Unionist for  |Birmingham_City_Council|Birmingham_City_Council|  for the All Saints Ward, located within  |his_fathers_parliamentary_constituency|Birmingham_West| .      Chamberlain was made chairman of the Town Planning Committee. Under his direction, Birmingham soon adopted one of the first town planning schemes in Britain. The start of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became  |Lord_Mayor_of_Birmingham|Lord_Mayor_Of_Birmingham| . Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlains uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Josephs brother  |Richard_Chamberlain|Richard_Chamberlain| , William and George Kenrick,  |Charles_Beale|Charles_Gabriel_Beale| , who had been four times Lord Mayor and  |Sir_Thomas_Martineau|Martineau_Family| . As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayors expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent. In 1915, Chamberlain was appointed a member of the Central Control Board on liquor traffic.      In December 1916, Prime Minister  |David_Lloyd_George|David_Lloyd_George|  offered Chamberlain the new position of  |Director_of_National_Service|Director_Of_National_Service| , with responsibility for co-ordinating  |conscription|Conscription|  and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. His tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George; in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned. The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would, thereafter, be one of mutual hatred.     Chamberlain decided to stand for the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , and was adopted as Unionist candidate for  |Birmingham_Ladywood|Birmingham_Ladywood| . After the war ended,  |a_general_election|1918_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  was called almost immediately. The campaign in this constituency was notable because his Liberal Party opponent was  |Mrs_Margery_Corbett_Ashby|Margery_Corbett_Ashby| , one of the seventeen women candidates who stood for Parliament at the first election at which women were eligible to do so. Chamberlain reacted to this intervention by being one of the few male candidates to specifically target women voters deploying his wife, issuing a special leaflet headed A word to the Ladies and holding two meetings in the afternoon. , Studley, 2018 chapter 4, Corbett Ashby in Ladywood. Chamberlains letters to his sisters detailing the campaign are deposited at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham. Chamberlain was elected with almost 70% of the vote and a majority of 6,833. He was 49 years old, which remains to date the greatest age at which any future Prime Minister has first been elected to the Commons.                   Chamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work. He was chairman of the national Unhealthy Areas Committee  and in that role, had visited the slums of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Cardiff.  Consequently, in March 1920,  |Bonar_Law|Bonar_Law|  offered him a junior post at the  |Ministry_of_Health|Department_Of_Health|  on behalf of the Prime Minister, but Chamberlain was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George and was offered no further posts during Lloyd Georges premiership. When Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament. Unionist leaders were willing to fight the  |1922_election|1922_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held  |a_meeting|Carlton_Club_Meeting,_19_October_1922|  at which they voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister.     Many high-ranking Unionists refused to serve under Bonar Law to the benefit of Chamberlain, who rose over the course of ten months from backbencher to Chancellor of the Exchequer. Bonar Law initially appointed Chamberlain  |Postmaster_General|Postmaster_General_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and Chamberlain was sworn of the  |Privy_Council|Privy_Council_Of_The_United_Kingdom| .  When Sir  |Arthur_Griffith-Boscawen|Arthur_Griffith-Boscawen| , the Minister of Health, lost his seat in the 1922 election and failed to win a by-election in March 1923, Bonar Law offered the position to Chamberlain. Two months later, Bonar Law was diagnosed with advanced, terminal  |throat_cancer|Throat_Cancer| . He immediately resigned and was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer  |Stanley_Baldwin|Stanley_Baldwin| . In August 1923, Baldwin promoted Chamberlain to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.     Chamberlain served only five months in the office before the Conservatives were defeated in the  |1923_general_election|1923_United_Kingdom_General_Election| .  |Ramsay_MacDonald|Ramsay_Macdonald|  became the first Labour Prime Minister, but his government fell within months, necessitating  |another_general_election|1924_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated the Labour candidate,  |Oswald_Mosley|Oswald_Mosley| , who later led the  |British_Union_of_Fascists|British_Union_Of_Fascists| . Believing he would lose if he stood again in Birmingham Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for  |Birmingham_Edgbaston|Birmingham_Edgbaston| , the district of the city where he was born and which was a much safer seat, which he would hold for the rest of his life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.     Within two weeks of his appointment as Minister of Health, Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law. Chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected  |Poor_Law|Poor_Law| |Boards_of_Guardians|Boards_Of_Guardians|  which administered relief—and which in some areas were responsible for  |rates|Rates| . Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. In 1929, Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons for two and a half hours on the  |second_reading|Second_Reading|  of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.     Though Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the  |1926_General_Strike|Uk_General_Strike_Of_1926| , in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition. Future Labour Prime Minister  |Clement_Attlee|Clement_Attlee|  complained that Chamberlain always treated us like dirt, and in April 1927 Chamberlain wrote: More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity.  His poor relations with the Labour Party later played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister.       Baldwin called  |a_general_election|1929_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  for 30 May 1929, resulting in a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament|  with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour, under MacDonald, again took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis as the  |May_Report|May_Report|  revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120  million. The Labour government resigned on 24 August, and MacDonald formed a  |National_Government|National_Government|  supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.     After the  |1931_general_election|1931_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , in which supporters of the National Government won an overwhelming victory, MacDonald designated Chamberlain as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Chamberlain proposed a 10% tariff on foreign goods and lower or no tariffs on goods from the colonies and the  |Dominions|Dominions| . Joseph Chamberlain had advocated a similar policy,  |Imperial_Preference|Imperial_Preference|  ; Neville Chamberlain laid his bill before the House of Commons on 4 February 1932, and concluded his address by noting the appropriateness of his seeking to enact his fathers proposal. At the end of the speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain walked down from the backbenches and shook his brothers hand. The  |Import_Duties_Act_1932|Import_Duties_Act_1932|  passed Parliament easily.     Chamberlain presented his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed at the inception of the National Government. Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on  |most_of_Britains_war_debt|War_Bondunited_Kingdom|  from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.       Chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the  |World_Monetary_and_Economic_Conference|London_Economic_Conference| , which came to nothing as US President  |Franklin_D._Roosevelt|Franklin_D._Roosevelt|  sent word that he would not consider any war  |debt_cancellation|Debt_Relief| . By 1934, Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and reverse many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office. He told the Commons, We have now finished the story of  Bleak House  and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of  Great Expectations .        The Unemployed Assistance Board  was largely Chamberlains creation, and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument.  Moreover, Chamberlain saw the importance of providing some interest in life for the large numbers of men never likely to get work, and out of this realisation was to come the responsibility of the UAB for the welfare, not merely the maintenance, of the unemployed. Bruce, p. 371.       Defence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlains early budgets. By 1935, faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitlers leadership , he was convinced of the need for rearmament. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force| , realising that Britains historical bulwark, the  |English_Channel|English_Channel| , was no defence against air power.     In 1935, MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister, and Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time. In the  |1935_general_election|1935_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , the Conservative-dominated National Government lost 90  seats from its massive 1931 majority, but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in the House of Commons. During the campaign, deputy Labour leader  |Arthur_Greenwood|Arthur_Greenwood|  had attacked Chamberlain for spending money on rearmament, saying that the rearmament policy was the merest scaremongering; disgraceful in a statesman of Mr Chamberlains responsible position, to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments.        Chamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the 1936  |abdication_crisis|Edward_Viii_Abdication_Crisis| . He wrote in his diary that  |Wallis_Simpson|Wallis_Simpson| , Edward VIIIs intended wife, was an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes. She has already ruined him in money and jewels  ...  In common with the rest of the Cabinet, except  |Duff_Cooper|Duff_Cooper| , he agreed with Baldwin that the King should abdicate if he married Simpson, and on 6 December he and Baldwin both stressed that the King should make his decision before Christmas; by one account, he believed that the uncertainty was hurting the Christmas trade .  The King abdicated on 10 December, four days after the meeting.     Soon after the abdication, Baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after the  |coronation_of_King_George_VI_and_Queen_Elizabeth|Coronation_Of_King_George_Vi_And_Queen_Elizabeth| . On 28 May, two weeks after the Coronation, Baldwin resigned, advising the King to send for Chamberlain. Sir Austen did not live to see his brothers final climb  ... to the top of the greasy pole,  having died two months earlier.                Upon his accession Chamberlain considered calling a general election, but with three and a half years remaining in the current Parliaments term he decided to wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century  to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary  |Anthony_Eden|Anthony_Eden|  a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlains premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.     Chamberlain had disliked what he considered to be the overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the  |President_of_the_Board_of_Trade|President_Of_The_Board_Of_Trade| ,  |Walter_Runciman|Walter_Runciman,_1St_Viscount_Runciman_Of_Doxford| , on the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, instead offering him the token position of  |Lord_Privy_Seal|Lord_Privy_Seal| , which an angry Runciman declined. Chamberlain thought Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.     At the time of his succession Chamberlains personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly to the camera. Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues; an attempt by his  |Parliamentary_Private_Secretary|Parliamentary_Private_Secretary_To_The_Prime_Minister| , Lord Dunglass , to bring him to the Commons Smoking Room to socialise with colleagues ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated  |press_management_system|Spin_Doctor|  employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at  |Number_10|10_Downing_Street| , led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.          Chamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions. One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs.     Soon after attaining the premiership, Chamberlain obtained passage of the Factories Act 1937. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. In 1938, Parliament enacted the  |Coal_Act_1938|Coal_Act_1938| , which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the  |Holidays_with_Pay_Act|Holiday_Pay_Act_1938| . Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay, it led to a great expansion of  |holiday_camps|Holiday_Camp|  and other leisure accommodation for the working classes. The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging  |slum_clearance|Slum_Clearance|  and maintained  |rent_control|Rent_Control| . Chamberlains plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect.       Relations between the United Kingdom and the  |Irish_Free_State|Irish_Free_State|  had been strained since the 1932 appointment of  |Éamon_de_Valera|Éamon_De_Valera|  as  |President_of_the_Executive_Council|President_Of_The_Executive_Council_Of_The_Irish_Free_State| . The  |Anglo-Irish_Trade_War|Anglo-Irish_Trade_War| , sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to sever the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the Kings status as Irish Head of State. As Chancellor, Chamberlain had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but as premier sought a settlement with Ireland, being persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions.     Talks had been suspended under Baldwin in 1936 but resumed in November 1937. De Valera sought not only to alter the constitutional status of Ireland, but to overturn other aspects of the  |Anglo-Irish_Treaty|Anglo-Irish_Treaty| , most notably the issue of  |partition|Partition_Of_Ireland| , as well as obtaining full control of the three  |Treaty_Ports|Treaty_Ports|  which had remained in British control. Britain, on the other hand, wished to retain the Treaty Ports, at least in time of war, and to obtain the money that Ireland had agreed to pay.     The Irish proved very tough negotiators, so much so that Chamberlain complained that one of de Valeras offers had presented United Kingdom ministers with a three-leafed shamrock, none of the leaves of which had any advantages for the UK.  With the talks facing deadlock, Chamberlain made the Irish a final offer in March 1938 which acceded to many Irish positions, though he was confident that he had only given up the small things, and the agreements were signed on 25 April 1938. The issue of partition was not resolved, but the Irish agreed to pay £10  million to the British. There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war, but Chamberlain accepted de Valeras oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access. Conservative backbencher  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  attacked the agreements in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports, which he described as the sentinel towers of the Western Approaches . When war came, de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under  |Irish_neutrality|Irish_Neutrality| . Churchill railed against these treaties in  The Gathering Storm , stating that he never saw the House of Commons more completely misled and that members were made to feel very differently about it when our existence hung in the balance during the  |Battle_of_the_Atlantic|Battle_Of_The_Atlantic| .  Chamberlain believed that the Treaty Ports were unusable if Ireland was hostile, and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with Dublin.              Chamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe. He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of her colonies, and during the  |Rhineland_crisis|Remilitarization_Of_The_Rhineland|  of March 1936 he had stated that if we were in sight of an all-round settlement the British government ought to consider the question of restoration of colonies.     The new Prime Ministers attempts to secure such a settlement were frustrated because Germany was in no hurry to talk to Britain. Foreign Minister  |Konstantin_von_Neurath|Konstantin_Von_Neurath|  was supposed to visit Britain in July 1937 but cancelled his visit.  |Lord_Halifax|E._F._L._Wood,_1St_Earl_Of_Halifax| , the  |Lord_President_of_the_Council|Lord_President_Of_The_Council| , visited Germany privately in November and met Hitler and other German officials. Both Chamberlain and British Ambassador to Germany  |Nevile_Henderson|Nevile_Henderson|  pronounced the visit a success. Foreign Office officials complained that the Halifax visit made it appear Britain was too eager for talks, and the Foreign Secretary,  |Anthony_Eden|Anthony_Eden| , felt that he had been bypassed.     Chamberlain also bypassed Eden while the Foreign Secretary was on holiday by opening direct talks with Italy, an international pariah for its  |invasion_and_conquest|Second_Italo-Abyssinian_War|  of  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| . At a Cabinet meeting on 8 September 1937, Chamberlain indicated that he saw the lessening of the tension between this country and Italy as a very valuable contribution toward the pacification and appeasement of Europe which would weaken the  |Rome–Berlin_axis|Axis_Powers| .  The Prime Minister also set up a private line of communication with the Italian Duce  |Benito_Mussolini|Benito_Mussolini|  through the Italian Ambassador, Count  |Dino_Grandi|Dino_Grandi| .     In February 1938, Hitler began to press the Austrian government to accept  |Anschluß|Anschluss| , or union between Germany and Austria. Chamberlain believed that it was essential to cement relations with Italy in the hope that an Anglo–Italian alliance would forestall Hitler from imposing his rule over Austria. Eden believed that Chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with Italy and holding out the prospect of  de jure  recognition of Italys conquest of Ethiopia. Chamberlain concluded that Eden would have to accept his policy or resign. The Cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for Chamberlain, and despite efforts by other Cabinet members to prevent it, Eden resigned from office. In later years, Eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement  but many ministers and MPs believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation. Chamberlain appointed Lord Halifax as Foreign Secretary in Edens place.       In March 1938 Austria became a part of Germany in the Anschluß . Though the beleaguered Austrians requested help from Britain, none was forthcoming. Britain did send Berlin a strong note of protest. In addressing the Cabinet shortly after German forces crossed the border, Chamberlain placed blame on both Germany and Austria. Chamberlain noted,          On 14 March, the day after the Anschluß, Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons and strongly condemned the methods used by the Germans in the takeover of Austria. Chamberlains address met with the approval of the House.        With Austria absorbed by Germany, attention turned to Hitlers obvious next target, the  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|  region of Czechoslovakia. With three million ethnic Germans, the Sudetenland represented the largest German population outside the Reich  and Hitler began to call for the union of the region with Germany. Britain had no military obligations toward Czechoslovakia, but France and Czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact and both the French and Czechoslovaks also had an alliance with the Soviet Union. After the fall of Austria, the Cabinets Foreign Policy Committee considered seeking a grand alliance to thwart Germany or, alternatively, an assurance to France of assistance if the French went to war. Instead, the committee chose to advocate that Czechoslovakia be urged to make the best terms it could with Germany. The full Cabinet agreed with the committees recommendation, influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that Britain could do to help the Czechs in the event of a German invasion. Chamberlain reported to an amenable House that he was unwilling to limit his governments discretion by giving commitments.     Britain and Italy signed an agreement in April 1938. In exchange for  de jure  recognition of Italys Ethiopian conquest, Italy agreed to withdraw some Italian volunteers from the Nationalist  side of the  |Spanish_Civil_War|Spanish_Civil_War| . By this point, the Nationalists strongly had the upper hand in that conflict, and they completed their victory the following year. Later that month, the new French Prime Minister,  |Édouard_Daladier|Édouard_Daladier| , came to London for talks with Chamberlain, and agreed to follow the British position on Czechoslovakia.     In May, Czech border guards shot two Sudeten German farmers who were trying to cross the border from Germany into Czechoslovakia without stopping for border controls. This incident caused unrest among the Sudeten Germans, and Germany was then said to be moving troops to the border. In response to the report, Prague moved troops to the German border. Halifax sent a note to Germany warning that if France intervened in the crisis on Czechoslovakias behalf, Britain might support France. Tensions appeared to calm, and Chamberlain and Halifax were applauded for their masterly handling of the crisis. Though it was not known at the time, it later became clear that Germany had had no plans for a May invasion of Czechoslovakia. Nonetheless, the Chamberlain government received strong and almost unanimous support from the British press.     Negotiations between the Czech government and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid-1938. They achieved little result; Sudeten leader  |Konrad_Henlein|Konrad_Henlein|  was under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement. On 3 August, Walter Runciman travelled to Prague as a  |mediator|Runciman_Mission|  sent by the British government. Over the next two weeks, Runciman met separately with Henlein, Czechoslovak President  |Edvard_Beneš|Edvard_Beneš| , and other leaders, but made no progress. On 30 August. Chamberlain met his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing—with only  |First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty|First_Lord_Of_The_Admiralty| |Duff_Cooper|Duff_Cooper|  dissenting against Chamberlains policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions, on the ground that Britain was then in no position to back up any threat to go to war.     Chamberlain realised that Hitler would likely signal his intentions in his 12 September speech at the annual  |Nuremberg_Rally|Nuremberg_Rally| , and so the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors how to respond if war seemed likely. In consultation with his close advisor Sir  |Horace_Wilson|Horace_Wilson| , Chamberlain set out Plan Z . If war seemed inevitable, Chamberlain would fly to Germany to negotiate directly with Hitler.           Lord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions. On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of  |Ostrava|Ostrava|  . The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved. As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitlers speech. The mission never resumed.          There was tremendous tension in the final days before Hitlers speech on the last day of the Rally, as Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia all partially mobilised their troops. Thousands gathered outside 10 Downing Street on the night of the speech. At last Hitler addressed his wildly enthusiastic followers:          The following morning, 13 September, Chamberlain and the Cabinet were informed by Secret Service sources that all German embassies had been told that Germany would invade Czechoslovakia on 25 September. Convinced that the French would not fight , Chamberlain decided to implement Plan Z and sent a message to Hitler that he was willing to come to Germany to negotiate. Hitler accepted and Chamberlain flew to Germany on the morning of 15 September; this was the first time, excepting a short jaunt at an industrial fair, that Chamberlain had ever flown. Chamberlain flew to Munich and then travelled by rail to Hitlers retreat at  |Berchtesgaden|Berchtesgaden| .     The face to face meeting lasted about three hours. Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland, and through questioning him, Chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that Hitler had no designs on the remainder of Czechoslovakia or on the areas in Eastern Europe which had German minorities. After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London, believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved. Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it. Czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations—principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks. The French agreed to the requirements. Under considerable pressure the Czechoslovaks also agreed, causing the Czechoslovak government to fall.          Chamberlain flew back to Germany, meeting Hitler in  |Bad_Godesberg|Bad_Godesberg|  on 22 September. Hitler brushed aside the proposals of the previous meeting, saying that wont do any more . Hitler demanded immediate occupation of the Sudetenland and that Polish and Hungarian territorial claims on Czechoslovakia be addressed. Chamberlain objected strenuously, telling Hitler that he had worked to bring the French and Czechoslovaks into line with Germanys demands, so much so that he had been accused of giving in to dictators and had been booed on his departure that morning. Hitler was unmoved.     That evening, Chamberlain told Lord Halifax that the meeting with Herr Hitler had been most unsatisfactory . The following day, Hitler kept Chamberlain waiting until mid-afternoon, when he sent a five-page letter, in German, outlining the demands he had made orally the previous day. Chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with the Czechoslovaks, and suggested that Hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to the French and Czechoslovaks.     The leaders met again late on the evening of 23 September—a meeting which stretched into the early morning hours. Hitler demanded that fleeing Czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them. He extended his deadline for occupation of the Sudetenland to 1 October—the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The meeting ended amicably, with Chamberlain confiding to Hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in Europe in the same spirit. Hitler hinted that the Sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in Europe. Chamberlain flew back to London, saying It is up to the Czechs now.        Hitlers proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks, but also from some members of Chamberlains cabinet. With no agreement in sight, war seemed inevitable. The Prime Minister issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought. On the evening of 27 September, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, and after thanking those who wrote to him, stated:          On 28 September, Chamberlain called on Hitler to invite him to Germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving the British, French, Germans, and Italians. Hitler replied favourably, and word of this response came to Chamberlain as he was winding up a speech in  |the_House_of_Commons|1935_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  which sat in gloomy anticipation of war. Chamberlain informed the House of this in his speech. The response was a passionate demonstration, with members cheering Chamberlain wildly. Even diplomats in the galleries applauded. Lord Dunglass later commented, There were a lot of appeasers in Parliament that day.      On the morning of 29 September Chamberlain left  |Heston_Aerodrome|Heston_Aerodrome|   for his third and final visit to Germany. On arrival in Munich the British delegation was taken directly to the  |Führerbau|Hochschule_Für_Musik_Und_Theater_München| , where Daladier,  |Mussolini|Benito_Mussolini| , and Hitler soon arrived. The four leaders and their translators held an informal meeting; Hitler said that he intended to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October. Mussolini distributed a proposal similar to Hitlers Bad Godesberg terms. In reality, the proposal had been drafted by German officials and transmitted to Rome the previous day. The four leaders debated the draft and Chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens, but Hitler refused to consider this.          The leaders were joined by advisors after lunch, and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the Italian draft agreement. Late that evening the British and French left for their hotels, saying that they had to seek advice from their respective capitals. Meanwhile, the Germans and Italians enjoyed the feast which Hitler had intended for all the participants. During this break, Chamberlain advisor  |Sir_Horace_Wilson|Horace_Wilson|  met with the Czechoslovaks; he informed them of the draft agreement and asked which districts were particularly important to them. The conference resumed at about 10  pm and was mostly in the hands of a small drafting committee. At 1:30  am the  |Munich_Agreement|Munich_Agreement|  was ready for signing, though the signing ceremony was delayed when Hitler discovered that the ornate inkwell on his desk was empty.     Chamberlain and Daladier returned to their hotel and informed the Czechoslovaks of the agreement. The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of the agreement, since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day. At 12:30  pm the Czechoslovak government in Prague objected to the decision but agreed to its terms.               Before leaving the Führerbau, Chamberlain requested a private conference with Hitler. Hitler agreed, and the two met at Hitlers apartment in the city later that morning. Chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed Anglo–German Agreement, which contained three paragraphs, including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again. According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected Ja! Ja! as the Prime Minister read it. The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister  |Joachim_von_Ribbentrop|Joachim_Von_Ribbentrop|  remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, Oh, dont take it so seriously. That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever.  Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, Ive got it!  Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlains return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters.     Chamberlain returned to London in triumph. Large crowds mobbed Heston, where he was met by the  |Lord_Chamberlain|Lord_Chamberlain| ,  |the_Earl_of_Clarendon|George_Villiers,_6Th_Earl_Of_Clarendon| , who gave him a letter from  |King_George_VI|George_Vi|  assuring him of the Empires lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report. The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain an hour and a half to journey the nine miles from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and  |Queen|Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother| . He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the front hall of Number 10 were packed. As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, Neville, go up to the window and say peace for our time.  Chamberlain turned around and responded, No, I dont do that sort of thing.  Nevertheless, in his statement to the crowd, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor,  |Benjamin_Disraeli|Benjamin_Disraeli| , upon the latters return from the  |Congress_of_Berlin|Congress_Of_Berlin|           King George issued a statement to his people, After the magnificent efforts of the Prime Minister in the cause of peace it is my fervent hope that a new era of friendship and prosperity may be dawning among the peoples of the world.  When the King met  |Duff_Cooper|Duff_Cooper| , who resigned as  |First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty|First_Lord_Of_The_Admiralty|  over the Munich Agreement, he told Cooper that he respected people who had the courage of their convictions, but could not agree with him. He wrote to his mother,  |Queen_Mary|Mary_Of_Teck| , that the Prime Minister was delighted with the results of his mission, as are we all.  The dowager queen responded to her son with anger against those who spoke against the Prime Minister: He brought home peace, why cant they be grateful?  Most newspapers supported Chamberlain uncritically, and he received thousands of gifts, from a silver dinner service to many of his trademark umbrellas.     The Commons discussed the Munich Agreement on 3 October. Though Cooper opened by setting forth the reasons for his resignation and Churchill spoke harshly against the pact, no Conservative voted against the government. Only between 20 and 30 abstained, including Churchill, Eden, Cooper, and  |Harold_Macmillan|Harold_Macmillan| .       In the aftermath of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, t would be madness for the country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good.  Later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich. Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes, but Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord. Having considered a general election immediately following Munich, Chamberlain instead  |reshuffled_his_Cabinet|Cabinet_Shuffle| . By the end of the year, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election would be suicidal .     Despite Hitlers relative quietness as the Reich absorbed the Sudetenland, foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy Chamberlain. He made trips to Paris and Rome, hoping to persuade the French to hasten their rearmament and Mussolini to be a positive influence on Hitler. Several of his Cabinet members, led by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, began to draw away from the appeasement policy. Halifax was by now convinced that Munich, though better than a European war, had been a horrid business and humiliating . Public revulsion over the pogrom of  Kristallnacht  on 9 November 1938 made any attempt at a rapprochement with Hitler unacceptable, though Chamberlain did not abandon his hopes.     Still hoping for reconciliation with Germany, Chamberlain made a major speech in Birmingham on 28 January 1939, in which he expressed his desire for international peace, and had an advance copy sent to Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Hitler seemed to respond; in his  |Reichstag|Reichstag|  speech on 30 January 1939, he stated that he wanted a long peace . Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table. This belief was reinforced by a German officials conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain. Chamberlain responded with a speech in  |Blackburn|Blackburn|  on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade, and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers. With matters appearing to improve, Chamberlains rule over the House of Commons was firm and he was convinced the government would romp home in a late 1939 election.     On 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, including Prague. Though Chamberlains initial parliamentary response was, according to biographer Nick Smart, feeble, within 48  hours he had spoken more forcefully against the German aggression. In another Birmingham speech, on 17 March, Chamberlain warned that no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made.  The Prime Minister questioned whether the invasion of Czechoslovakia was the end of an old adventure, or the beginning of a new and whether it was a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force.   |Colonial_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_The_Colonies| |Malcolm_MacDonald|Malcolm_Macdonald|  said, whereas the Prime Minister was once a strong advocate of peace, he has now definitely swung around to the war point of view.  This speech was met with widespread approval in Britain and recruitment for the armed services increased considerably.     Chamberlain set out to build an interlocking series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries as a means of deterring Hitler from war. He sought an agreement among Britain, France, the USSR, and Poland, whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail. Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of  |British_and|Anglo-Polish_Military_Alliance| |French_guarantees|Franco-Polish_Military_Alliance|  that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence. In the ensuing debate, Eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government. Even Churchill and Lloyd George praised Chamberlains government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.     The Prime Minister took other steps to deter Hitler from aggression. He doubled the size of the  |Territorial_Army|Territorial_Army| , created a  |Ministry_of_Supply|Ministry_Of_Supply|  to expedite the provision of equipment to the armed forces, and instituted peacetime conscription. The  |Italian_invasion_of_Albania|Italian_Invasion_Of_Albania|  on 7 April 1939 led to guarantees being given to Greece and Romania. On 17 June 1939,  |Handley_Page|Handley_Page|  received an order for 200  |Hampden|Handley_Page_Hampden|  twin-engined medium bombers, and by 3 September 1939, the chain of radar stations girdling the British coast was fully operational.      Chamberlain was reluctant to seek a military alliance with the Soviet Union; he distrusted  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  ideologically and felt that there was little to gain, given the recent massive purges in the  |Red_Army|Red_Army| . Much of his Cabinet favoured such an alliance, and when Poland withdrew her objection to an Anglo–Soviet alliance, Chamberlain had little choice but to proceed. The talks with Soviet Foreign Minister  |Vyacheslav_Molotov|Vyacheslav_Molotov| , to which Britain sent only a low-level delegation, dragged on over several months and eventually foundered on 14 August 1939 when Poland and Romania refused to allow Soviet troops to be stationed on their territories. A week after the failure of these talks, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the  |Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact| , committing the countries to non-aggression toward each other. A secret agreement divided up Poland in the event of war. Chamberlain had disregarded rumours of a Soviet–German rapprochement and was dismissive of the publicly announced pact, stating that it in no way affected British obligations toward Poland. On 23 August 1939, Chamberlain had Henderson deliver a letter to Hitler telling him that Britain was fully prepared to comply with its obligations to Poland. Hitler instructed his generals to prepare for  |an_invasion_of_Poland|Fall_Weiss| , telling them, Our enemies are small worms. I saw them at Munich.                 Germany  |invaded_Poland|Invasion_Of_Poland|  in the early morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish territory Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00  pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader  |Arthur_Greenwood|Arthur_Greenwood|  entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.      No formal declaration of war was immediately made. French Foreign Minister  |Georges_Bonnet|Georges_Bonnet|  stated that France could do nothing until its parliament met on the evening of 2 September. Bonnet was trying to rally support for a Munich-style summit proposed by the Italians to be held on 5 September. The British Cabinet demanded that Hitler be given an ultimatum at once, and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of 2 September, that war be declared forthwith. Chamberlain and Halifax were convinced by Bonnets pleas from Paris that France needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation, and postponed the expiry of the ultimatum . Chamberlains lengthy statement to the House of Commons made no mention of an ultimatum, and the House received it badly. When Greenwood rose to speak for the working classes, Conservative backbencher  |Leo_Amery|Leo_Amery|  urged him, Speak for England, Arthur, implying that the Prime Minister was not doing so. Chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with Paris and tried to dispel fears that the French were weakening. He had little success; too many members knew of Bonnets efforts. National Labour MP and diarist  |Harold_Nicolson|Harold_Nicolson|  later wrote, In those few minutes he flung away his reputation.  The seeming delay gave rise to fears that Chamberlain would again seek a settlement with Hitler. Chamberlains last peacetime Cabinet met at 11:30 that night, with a thunderstorm raging outside, and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in Berlin at nine oclock the following morning—to expire two hours later, before the House of Commons convened at noon. At 11:15  am, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, stating that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany:          That afternoon Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons first Sunday session in over 120 years. He spoke to a quiet House in a statement which even opponents termed restrained and therefore effective :                 Chamberlain instituted a  |War_Cabinet|War_Cabinetchamberlain_War_Ministry|  and invited the Labour and Liberal parties to join his government, but they declined. He restored Churchill to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the War Cabinet. Chamberlain also gave Eden a government post  but not a seat in the small War Cabinet. The new First Lord proved to be a difficult Cabinet colleague, deluging the Prime Minister with a sea of lengthy memos. Chamberlain castigated Churchill for sending so many memos, as the two met in War Cabinet every day. Chamberlain suspected, correctly as it proved after the war, that these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the Book that he will write hereafter.  Chamberlain was also able to deter some of Churchills more extreme plans, such as  |Operation_Catherine|Operation_Catherine| , which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea|  with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to Germany. With the naval war the only significant front involving the British in the early months of the conflict, the First Lords obvious desire to wage a ruthless, victorious war established him as a leader-in-waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues.     With little land action in the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the Bore War, later renamed the  |Phoney_War|Phoney_War|  by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied officials and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. The Prime Minister was reluctant to go too far in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, the only thing that matters is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process.  Government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.       In early 1940  |the_Allies_approved|Plan_R_4|  a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of  |Narvik|Narvik| , and possibly also to seize the iron mines at  |Gällivare|Gällivare|  in northern Sweden, from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore. As the Baltic froze in winter, the iron ore was then sent south by ship from Narvik. The Allies planned to begin by  |mining_Norwegian_waters|Operation_Wilfred| , thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then would occupy much of the country. Unforeseen by the Allies, Germany had also planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an  |invasion_of_Norway|Operation_Weserübung| . German forces quickly overran much of the country. The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal. The Prime Ministers opponents decided to turn the  |adjournment_debate|Adjournment_Debate|  for the  |Whitsun|Whitsun|  recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan. After initial anger, Chamberlain determined to fight. Erin Redihan, Neville Chamberlain and Norway: The Trouble with A Man of Peace in a Time of War. New England Journal of History 691/2 pp. 1-18.     What became known as the  |Norway_debate|Norway_Debate|  opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, including Chamberlains, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir  |Roger_Keyes|Roger_Keyes,_1St_Baron_Keyes| , member for  |Portsmouth_North|Portsmouth_North| , in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism.  |Leo_Amery|Leo_Amery|  then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing  |Oliver_Cromwells|Oliver_Cromwell|  words on dissolving the  |Long_Parliament|Long_Parliament|  When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his friends—and I still have some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight.  Because the use of the word friends was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an error of judgment for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty when the gravity of the war situation required national unity.  Lloyd George joined the attackers, and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38  MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.     Chamberlain spent much of 9 May in meetings with his Cabinet colleagues. Many Conservative MPs, even those who had voted against the government, indicated on 9 May and in the days following that they did not wish Chamberlain to depart but rather would seek to reconstruct his government. Chamberlain decided that he would resign unless the Labour Party was willing to join his government, and so he met with Attlee later that day. Attlee was unwilling, but agreed to consult his National Executive then meeting in  |Bournemouth|Bournemouth| . Chamberlain favoured Halifax as the next Prime Minister, but Halifax proved reluctant to press his own claims, and Churchill emerged as the choice. The following day, Germany invaded the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries|  and Chamberlain considered remaining in office. Attlee confirmed that Labour would not serve under Chamberlain, though they were willing to serve under someone else. Accordingly, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to resign and advise the King to send for Churchill. Churchill later expressed gratitude to Chamberlain for not advising the King to send for Halifax, who would have commanded the support of most government MPs. In a resignation broadcast that evening, Chamberlain told the nation,               Queen Elizabeth told Chamberlain that her daughter,  |Princess_Elizabeth|Elizabeth_Ii| , wept as she heard the broadcast. Churchill wrote to express his gratitude for Chamberlains willingness to stand by him in the nations hour of need, and Lord Baldwin, the only living former Prime Minister besides Chamberlain and Lloyd George, wrote, You have passed through fire since we were talking together only a fortnight ago, and you have come out pure gold.        In a departure from usual practice, Chamberlain did not issue any  |resignation_Honours_list|Prime_Ministers_Resignation_Honours| . With Chamberlain remaining leader of the Conservative Party, and with many MPs still supporting him and distrusting the new Prime Minister, Churchill refrained from any purge of Chamberlain loyalists. Churchill wished Chamberlain to return to the Exchequer, but he declined, convinced that this would lead to difficulties with the Labour Party. Instead, he accepted the post of  |Lord_President_of_the_Council|Lord_President_Of_The_Council|  with a seat in the shrunken five-member War Cabinet. When Chamberlain entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1940, for the first time since his resignation, MPs lost their heads, they shouted, they cheered, they waved their order papers, and his reception was a regular ovation.  The House received Churchill coolly; some of his great speeches to the chamber, such as  |We_shall_fight_on_the_beaches|We_Shall_Fight_On_The_Beaches| , met with only half-hearted enthusiasm.     Chamberlains fall from power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, Few men can have known such a reversal of fortune in so short a time.  He especially regretted the loss of  |Chequers|Chequers|  as a place where I have been so happy, though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote, I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind.  As Lord President, Chamberlain assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchills many absences. Attlee later remembered him as free from any of the rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike.  As chairman of the  |Lord_Presidents_Committee|Lord_Presidents_Committee| , he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. Halifax reported to the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries|  conquered and French Prime Minister  |Paul_Reynaud|Paul_Reynaud|  warning that France might have to sign an armistice, that diplomatic contacts with a still-neutral Italy offered the possibility of a negotiated peace. Halifax urged following up and seeing if a worthwhile offer could be obtained. The  |battle_over_the_course_of_action_within_the_War_Cabinet|May_1940_War_Cabinet_Crisis|  lasted three days; Chamberlains statement on the final day, that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the matter should not be pursued at that time, helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.          Twice in May 1940, Churchill broached the subject of bringing Lloyd George into the government. Each time, Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd Georges appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud. Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchills government.     Chamberlain worked to bring his Conservative Party in line behind Churchill, working with the  |Chief_Whip|Chief_Whip| ,  |David_Margesson|David_Margesson| , to overcome members suspicions and dislikes of the Prime Minister. On 4 July, after the  |British_attack_on_the_French_fleet|Attack_On_Mers-El-Kébir| , Churchill entered the chamber to a great cheer from Conservative MPs orchestrated by the two, and the Prime Minister was almost overcome with emotion at the first cheer he had received from his own partys benches since May. Churchill returned the loyalty, refusing to consider Labour and Liberal attempts to expel Chamberlain from the government. When criticisms of Chamberlain appeared in the press, and when Chamberlain learned that Labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of Parliament as a platform to attack him, he told Churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking Labour. The Prime Minister intervened with the Labour Party and the press and the criticism ceased, according to Chamberlain, like turning off a tap .     In July 1940, a polemic titled  Guilty Men  was released by Cato —a pseudonym for three journalists . It attacked the record of the National Government, alleging that it had failed to prepare adequately for war. It called for the removal of Chamberlain and other ministers who had allegedly contributed to the British disasters of the early part of the war. The short book sold more than 200,000 copies, many of which were passed from hand-to-hand, and went into 27 editions in the first few months, despite not being carried by several major bookshops. According to historian David Dutton, its impact upon Chamberlains reputation, both among the general public and within the academic world, was profound indeed.      Chamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health, except for occasional attacks of gout, but by July 1940 he was in almost constant pain. He sought treatment, and later that month entered hospital for surgery. Surgeons discovered that he was suffering from terminal  |bowel_cancer|Colorectal_Cancer| , but they concealed it from him, instead telling him that he would not require further surgery. Chamberlain resumed work in mid-August. He returned to his office on 9 September, but renewed pain, compounded by the night-time bombing of London which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest, sapped his energy, and he left London for the last time on 19 September, returning to  |Highfield_Park|Highfield_Park,_Heckfield|  in  |Heckfield|Heckfield| . Chamberlain offered his resignation to Churchill on 22 September. The Prime Minister was initially reluctant to accept, but as both men realised that Chamberlain would never return to work, Churchill finally allowed him to resign. The Prime Minister asked if Chamberlain would accept the highest order of British chivalry, the  |Order_of_the_Garter|Order_Of_The_Garter| , of which his brother had been a member. Chamberlain refused, saying he would prefer to die plain Mr Chamberlain like my father before me, unadorned by any title.      In the short time remaining to him, Chamberlain was angered by the short, cold and for the most part depreciatory  press comments on his retirement, according to him written without the slightest sign of sympathy for the man or even any comprehension that there may be a human tragedy in the background.  The King and Queen drove down from  |Windsor|Windsor_Castle|  to visit the dying man on 14 October. Chamberlain received hundreds of sympathetic letters from friends and supporters. He wrote to  |John_Simon|John_Simon,_1St_Viscount_Simon| , who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Chamberlains government:            Chamberlain died of  |bowel_cancer|Bowel_Cancer|  on 9 November 1940 at the age of 71. A funeral service took place at  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey|  . After cremation, his ashes were interred in the Abbey next to those of  |Bonar_Law|Bonar_Law| . Churchill eulogised Chamberlain in the House of Commons three days after his death:          Though some Chamberlain supporters found Churchills oratory to be  |faint_praise|Damn_With_Faint_Praise|  of the late Prime Minister, Churchill added less publicly, Whatever shall I do without poor Neville? I was relying on him to look after the Home Front for me.  Amongst others who paid tribute to Chamberlain in the Commons and in the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords|  on 12 November were Lord Halifax, Attlee, and the Liberal Party leader and Air Minister, Sir  |Archibald_Sinclair|Archibald_Sinclair| . Lloyd George, the only former Prime Minister remaining in the Commons, had been expected to speak, but absented himself from the proceedings. Ever close to his family, the executors of Chamberlains will were his cousins,  |Wilfred_Byng_Kenrick|Wilfred_Byng_Kenrick|  and  |Sir_Wilfrid_Martineau|Martineau_Family| , both of whom, like Chamberlain, were  |Lord_Mayors|Lord_Mayor|  of Birmingham.             A few days before his death, Neville Chamberlain wrote,          Guilty Men was not the only Second World War tract that damaged Chamberlains reputation. We Were Not All Wrong, published in 1941, took a similar tack to Guilty Men, arguing that Liberal and Labour MPs, and a small number of Conservatives, had fought against Chamberlains appeasement policies. The author, Liberal MP  |Geoffrey_Mander|Geoffrey_Mander| , had voted against conscription in 1939. Another polemic against Conservative policies was Why Not Trust the Tories , which castigated the Conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of Baldwin and Chamberlain. Though a few Conservatives offered their own versions of events, most notably MP  |Quintin_Hogg|Quintin_Hogg,_Baron_Hailsham_Of_St_Marylebone|  in his 1945  The Left was Never Right , by the end of the war, there was a very strong public belief that Chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgements that had nearly caused Britains defeat.     Chamberlains reputation was devastated by these attacks from the left. In 1948, with the publication of The Gathering Storm, the first volume of Churchills six-volume set,  The Second World War , Chamberlain sustained an even more serious assault from the right. While Churchill stated privately, this is not history, this is my case , his series was still hugely influential. Churchill depicted Chamberlain as well-meaning but weak, blind to the threat posed by Hitler, and oblivious to the fact that Hitler could have been removed from power by a grand coalition of European states. Churchill suggested that the years delay between Munich and war worsened Britains position, and criticised Chamberlain for both peacetime and wartime decisions. In the years following the publication of Churchills books, few historians questioned his judgment.      |Anne_Chamberlain|Anne_Chamberlain| , the former premiers widow, suggested that Churchills work was filled with matters that are not real misstatements that could easily be corrected, but wholesale omissions and assumptions that certain things are now recognised as facts which actually have no such position .     Many of Chamberlains family letters and his extensive personal papers were bequeathed by his family in 1974 to the Birmingham University Archives.    During the war, the Chamberlain family had commissioned historian  |Keith_Feiling|Keith_Feiling|  to produce an official biography, and gave him access to Chamberlains private diaries and papers. While Feiling had the right of access to official papers as the official biographer of a recently deceased person, he may not have been aware of the provision, and the  |Cabinet_Secretary|Cabinet_Secretary|  denied his requests for access.     Though Feiling produced what historian David Dutton described in 2001 as the most impressive and persuasive single-volume biography of Chamberlain , he could not repair the damage already done to Chamberlains reputation.     Conservative MP  |Iain_Macleods|Iain_Macleod|  1961 biography of Chamberlain was the first major biography of a revisionist school of thought on Chamberlain. The same year,  |A._J._P._Taylor|A._J._P._Taylor| , in his  The Origins of the Second World War , found that Chamberlain had adequately rearmed Britain for defence and described Munich as a triumph for all that was best and most enlightened in British life  ... for those who had courageously denounced the harshness and short-sightedness of Versailles .     The adoption of the  |thirty-year_rule|Thirty-Year_Rule|  in 1967 made available many of the papers of the Chamberlain government over the subsequent three years, helping to explain why Chamberlain acted as he did. The resultant works greatly fuelled the revisionist school, although they also included books that strongly criticised Chamberlain, such as  |Keith_Middlemass|Keith_Middlemas|  1972 Diplomacy of Illusion . Released papers indicated that, contrary to claims made in Guilty Men, Chamberlain had neither ignored the advice of the Foreign Office nor had he disregarded and run roughshod over his Cabinet. Other released papers showed that Chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst European governments like that later advocated by Churchill, but had rejected it on the ground that the division of Europe into two camps would make war more, not less likely. They also showed that Chamberlain had been advised that the Dominions, pursuing independent foreign policies under the  |Statute_of_Westminster|Statute_Of_Westminster_1931| , had indicated that Chamberlain could not depend on their help in the event of a Continental war. The Chiefs of Staff report, which indicated that Britain could not forcibly prevent Germany from conquering Czechoslovakia, was first publicly known at this time.   In reaction to the revisionist school of thought regarding Chamberlain a post-revisionist school emerged beginning in the 1990s, using the released papers to justify the initial conclusions of Guilty Men. Oxford historian  |R._A._C._Parker|R._A._C._Parker|  argued that Chamberlain could have forged a close alliance with France after the  Anschluß , in early 1938, and begun a policy of containment of Germany under the auspices of the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations| . While many revisionist writers had suggested that Chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions, Parker argued that Chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies. In his two volumes, Chamberlain and Appeasement and Churchill and Appeasement , Parker stated that Chamberlain, due to his powerful, obstinate personality and his skill in debate, caused Britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence. Parker also suggested that had Churchill held high office in the second half of the 1930s Churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred Hitler, and perhaps would have caused Hitlers domestic opponents to procure his removal.     Dutton observes that Chamberlains reputation, for good or ill, will probably always be closely tied to evaluation of his policy toward Germany:       |Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society|Fellow_Of_The_Royal_Society|  – 1938   |Oxford_University|Oxford_University|  –  |DCL|Doctor_Of_Civil_Law| |Cambridge_University|Cambridge_University|  – LLD    |Birmingham_University|Birmingham_University|  – LLD    |Bristol_University|Bristol_University|  – LLD    |Leeds_University|Leeds_University|  – LLD    |Reading_University|Reading_University|  – DLitt       Honorary Freedom  |City_of_Birmingham|City_Of_Birmingham|     Honorary Freedom  |City_of_London|City_Of_London|  – conferred 1940 but died before acceptance, the scroll being presented to his widow in 1941        Chamberlains arms were Gules eight Cinquefoils in orle Or.        1939: Honorary Air Commodore, No 916 Balloon Squadron,  |Auxiliary_Air_Force|Auxiliary_Air_Force|               Explanatory notes        Citations   .
