        The Downward Spiral is the second studio album by American  |industrial_rock|Industrial_Rock|  band  |Nine_Inch_Nails|Nine_Inch_Nails| , released on March 8, 1994, by  |Nothing_Records|Nothing_Records|  and  |Interscope_Records|Interscope_Records|  in the United States and by  |Island_Records|Island_Records|  in Europe. It is a  |concept_album|Concept_Album|  detailing the destruction of a man from the beginning of his downward spiral to his death by suicide. The Downward Spiral features elements of industrial rock,  |techno|Techno|  and  |heavy_metal_music|Heavy_Metal_Music| , in contrast to the bands  |synthpop|Synthpop| -influenced debut album  Pretty Hate Machine  , and was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman  |Trent_Reznor|Trent_Reznor|  and  |Flood|Flood| .     In 1992, Reznor moved to  |10050_Cielo_Drive|10050_Cielo_Drive|  in  |Benedict_Canyon_Los_Angeles|Benedict_Canyon_Los_Angeles| , where actress  |Sharon_Tate|Sharon_Tate|  was  |murdered|Tate_Murders|  by members of the  |Manson_Family|Manson_Family| . It was used as a studio called Le Pig for recording  Broken  and The Downward Spiral with collaborations from other musicians. The album was influenced by late-1970s rock music albums such as  |David_Bowies|David_Bowie|   Low  and  |Pink_Floyds|Pink_Floyd|   The Wall  in particular, and focused on texture and space.     The album spawned two singles,  |March_of_the_Pigs|March_Of_The_Pigs|  and  |Closer|Closer|  , in addition to the promotional singles  |Piggy|Piggy|  and  |Hurt|Hurt|  . March of the Pigs and Closer were accompanied by music videos, with the former shot twice and the latters heavily censored.     The Downward Spiral was a commercial success, and established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the  |1990s_music_scene|1990S_In_Music| , with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media attention and multiple honors, while diverging into drug abuse and depression. It has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s, and was praised for its abrasive and eclectic nature and dark themes, although it was scrutinized by social conservatives for some of its lyrics. A  |remix_album|Remix_Album|  titled  Further Down the Spiral  was released in 1995.          The Downward Spiral was conceived after the Lollapalooza festival tour as Trent Reznor thought of a negative vibe felt by the band when they were in a European hotel.  |Nine_Inch_Nails_live_performances|Nine_Inch_Nails_Live_Performances|  were known for its aggressive on-stage dynamic, in which band members act angry, injure themselves, and destroy instruments. Reznor had a  |feud|Trent_Reznor–Tvt_Records_Feud|  with  |TVT_Records|Tvt_Records|  that resulted in him co-founding Nothing Records with his former manager  |John_Malm_Jr_|John_Malm_Jr_|  and signing with Interscope. He wanted to explore a fictional character whose life is psychologically wounded and developed a concept about the albums themes; he later used the concept as lyrics. The concept was based on Reznors social issues at the time: he had personal conflicts with band member  |Richard_Patrick|Richard_Patrick|  and was known for enjoying  |alcohol|Alcoholic_Beverage| .   When developing The Downward Spiral, Reznor struggled with drug addiction and was depressed as he wrote songs related to personal issues. His friends suggested that he could take Prozac , an  |antidepressant|Antidepressant| , but this choice did not appeal to him.  He wanted the albums sound to diverge from Broken, emphasizing mood, texture, restraint and subtlety, although he was not sure about its musical direction. The album was made with full range and focused on texture and space, avoiding explicit usage of guitars or synthesizers.      Reznor searched for and moved to  |10050_Cielo_Drive|10050_Cielo_Drive|  in 1992 for recording Broken and The Downward Spiral,  a decision made against his initial choice to record the album in  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans| .  10050 Cielo Drive is referred to as the Tate House since Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family in 1969; Reznor named the studio Le Pig after the message that was scrawled on the front door with Tates blood by her murderers, and stayed there with Malm for 18 months. He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive terrifying because he already knew it and read books related to the incident. Reznor chose the Tate house to calibrate his engineering skills and the band bought a large console and two Studer machines as resources, a move that he believed was cheaper than renting. The studio was also used for the recording of  |Marilyn_Mansons|Marilyn_Manson|  debut album  Portrait of an American Family , which Reznor co-produced. Marilyn Manson accepted Reznors offer of signing a contract with Nothing Records.      Reznor collaborated with former  |Janes_Addiction|Janes_Addiction|  and  |Porno_for_Pyros|Porno_For_Pyros|  drummer  |Stephen_Perkins|Stephen_Perkins| , progressive rock guitarist  |Adrian_Belew|Adrian_Belew| , and Nine Inch Nails drummer  |Chris_Vrenna|Chris_Vrenna| .  Belews first visit to the studio involved playing the guitar parts in Mr. Self-Destruct , and he was told to play freely, think on reacting to melodies, concentrate on rhythm, and use noise. This approach improved Reznors confidence in the instrument: he found it to be more expressive than the keyboard due to the interface. Belew praised Reznor for his command of technology, and commented that the music of Nine Inch Nails made innovations that are in realm.  Vrenna and Perkins played drum parts recorded live in the studio; the tracks were rendered into looped samples. Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts: he would tape 20- to 25-minute-long sessions of himself playing guitars on a hard disc recorder with the Studio Vision sequencer.     Most of the music was recorded into a  |Macintosh|Macintosh|  computer using a board and manipulated with music editor programs on the computer. Unique effects such as analyzing and inverting the frequency were applied to the tracks to create original sounds. The band would get an arrangement together and convert it into analog tape.  Reznor sampled excerpts from guitar tracks and processed them to the point of randomness and expression. Among the equipment Reznor used for recording the album are  |Pro_Tools|Pro_Tools| ,  |Digidesigns|Digidesign|  TurboSynth, a  |Marshall|Marshall_Amplification|  rack head, the  |Prophet_VS|Sequential_Circuitssequential_Circuits_Products|  keyboard, and various  |Jackson|Jackson_Guitars|  and  |Gibson|Gibson_Guitar_Corporation|  guitars.     In December 1993, Reznor was confronted by Patti Tate, who asked if he was exploiting Sharon Tates death in the house. Reznor responded that he was interested in the house as her death happened there. He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with  Rolling Stone      Flood, known for engineering and producing  |U2|U2|  and  |Depeche_Mode|Depeche_Mode|  albums, was employed as co-producer on The Downward Spiral. It became his last collaboration with Nine Inch Nails due to creative differences. A very dangerously self-destructive, humorous short song written for the album, Just Do It , was not included in the final version and criticized by Flood in that Reznor had gone too far. Reznor completed the last song written for the album, Big Man with a Gun , in late 1993.  Also posted at  After the albums recording, Reznor moved out and the house was demolished shortly thereafter. The Downward Spiral entered its mixing and mastering processes, done at  |Record_Plant|Record_Plant|  Studios and  |A_M_Studios|Henson_Recording_Studios|  with  |Alan_Moulder|Alan_Moulder| , who subsequently took on more extensive production duties for future album releases.               Numerous layers of metaphors are present throughout The Downward Spiral, leaving it open to wide interpretation. The album relays  |nihilism|Nihilism|  and is defined by a prominent theme of  |self_abuse|Self_Destructive_Behaviour|  and  |self_control|Self_Control| . It is a semi-autobiographical concept album, in which the overarching plot follows the protagonists descent into madness in his own inner  |solipsistic|Solipsism|  world through a metaphorical downward spiral , dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally, suicide.  Reznor described the concept as consisting of someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on. Media journalists like  The New York Times  writer  |Jon_Pareles|Jon_Pareles|  noted the albums theme of angst had already been used by  |grunge|Grunge|  bands like  |Nirvana|Nirvana| , and that Nine Inch Nails depiction was more generalized.     Using elements of genres such as  |techno|Techno| ,   |dance|Dance_Music| ,  |electronic|Electronic_Music| ,   |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metal_Music| ,  and  |hard_rock|Hard_Rock| ,  The Downward Spiral is considered  |industrial_rock|Industrial_Rock| ,    |industrial|Industrial_Music| ,   |ambient|Ambient_Music| ,  and  |alternative_rock|Alternative_Rock| .  Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements that do not follow  |verse–chorus_form|Verse–Chorus_Form| , and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody or harmony . The treatment of metal guitars in Broken is carried over to The Downward Spiral, which includes innovative techniques such as expanded song structures and unconventional time signatures. The album features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of the central protagonist.  Reznors singing follows a similar pattern from beginning to end, frequently moving from whispers to screams.  These techniques are all used in the song Hurt , which features a highly dissonant  |tritone|Tritone|  played on guitar during the verses, a B511, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word I every time the B/E  |dyad|Dyad|  is played.      Mr. Self Destruct , a song about a powerful person, follows a build-up sampled from the 1971 film  THX 1138  with an industrial roar and is accompanied by an audio loop of a pinion rotating. The Becoming expresses the state of being dead and the protagonists transformation into a non-human organism. Closer concludes with a chromatic piano  |motif|Motif| |drop_D_tuning|Drop_D_Tuning|  throughout the chorus of Heresy , and recurs for the final time on The Downward Spiral .  The album was chiefly inspired by David Bowies  Low , an experimental rock album which Reznor related to on songwriting, mood, and structures, as well as progressive rock group Pink Floyds  The Wall , a concept album featuring themes of abuse, isolation, and mental instability.        Committere, an installation featuring artwork and sketches for The Downward Spiral, Closer and March of the Pigs by  |Russell_Mills|Russell_Mills|  was displayed at the  |Glasgow_School_of_Art|Glasgow_School_Of_Art| . Mills explained the ideas and materials that made up the painting that was used for the albums  |cover_art|Cover_Art|            March of the Pigs and Closer were released as singles; two other songs, Hurt and Piggy , were issued to radio without a commercial single release.  March of the Pigs has an unusual  |meter|Meter| , alternating three  |bars|Bar|  of 7/8 time with one of 8/8 , and has a  |BPM|Beats_Per_Minute|  rate of 269. The songs music video was directed by  |Peter_Christopherson|Peter_Christopherson|  and was shot twice; the first version scrapped due to Reznors involvement, and the released second version being a live performance.     Closer features a heavily modified bass drum sample from the  |Iggy_Pop|Iggy_Pop|  song  |Nightclubbing|Nightclubbing|  from his album  The Idiot .  Lyrically, it is a meditation on self-hatred and obsession, but to Reznors dismay, the song was widely misinterpreted as a lust anthem due to its chorus, which included the line I wanna fuck you like an animal . The music video for Closer was directed by  |Mark_Romanek|Mark_Romanek|  and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network heavily censored the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask, a monkey tied to a cross, a pigs head spinning on a machine, a diagram of a vulva, Reznor wearing an S & M mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a ball gag.  A radio edit that partially censored the songs explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.  The video has since been made part of the permanent collection of the  |Museum_of_Modern_Art|Museum_Of_Modern_Art|  in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| .      Piggy uses nothing can stop me now , a line that recurs in Ruiner and Big Man with a Gun . The frantic drumming on the songs outro is Reznors only attempt at performing drums on the record, and one of the few live drum performances on the album. He had stated that the recording was from him testing the microphone setup in studio, but he liked the sound too much not to include it. It was released as a promotional single in December 1994 and reached the Top 20 on the  |Billboard_Modern_Rock_Tracks|Billboard_Modern_Rock_Tracks|  chart.     Released in 1995, Hurt clearly includes references to  |self_harm|Self_Harm|  and  |heroin_addiction|Drug_Abuse| .              The Nine Inch Nails live band embarked on the Self Destruct tour in support of The Downward Spiral. Chris Vrenna and  |James_Woolley|James_Woolley|  performed drums and keyboards respectively,  |Robin_Finck|Robin_Finck|  replaced  |Richard_Patrick|Richard_Patrick|  on guitar and bassist  |Danny_Lohner|Danny_Lohner|  was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as Hurt . The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very few actual ones. The tour debuted the bands grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.     The tour included a set at  |Woodstock_94|Woodstock_94|  broadcast on  |pay_per_view|Pay_Per_View|  and seen in as many as 24  million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair entering his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have stolen the show from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded.   The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements.  Its performance of  |Happiness_in_Slavery|Happiness_In_Slavery|  from the Woodstock concert earned the group a  |Grammy_Award|Grammy_Award|  for  |Best_Metal_Performance|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Metal_Performance|  in 1995.   Entertainment Weekly  commented about the bands Woodstock 94 performance: Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core—an experience as draining as it is exhilarating .  Despite this acclaim, Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties.     The main leg of the tour featured Marilyn Manson as the supporting act, who featured bassist  |Jeordie_White|Jeordie_White|  ; White later played bass with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007.  After another tour leg supporting the remix album Further Down the Spiral, Nine Inch Nails contributed to the  |Alternative_Nation_Festival|Alternative_Nation_Festival|  in Australia and subsequently embarked on the  |Dissonance_Tour|Outside_Tour| , which included 26 separate performances with co-headliner David Bowie. Nine Inch Nails was the opening act for the tour, and its set transitioned into Bowies set with joint performances of both bands songs. However, the crowds reportedly did not respond positively to the pairing due to their creative differences.      The tour concluded with Nights of Nothing , a three-night showcase of performances from Nothing Records bands Marilyn Manson,  |Prick|Prick| ,  |Meat_Beat_Manifesto|Meat_Beat_Manifesto| , and  |Pop_Will_Eat_Itself|Pop_Will_Eat_Itself| , which ended with an 80-minute set from Nine Inch Nails.  Kerrang!  described the Nine Inch Nails set during the Nights of Nothing showcase as tight, brash and dramatic , but was disappointed at the lack of new material. On the second of the three nights, Richard Patrick was briefly reunited with the band and contributed guitar to a performance of  |Head_Like_a_Hole|Head_Like_A_Hole|  .  After the Self Destruct tour, Chris Vrenna, member of the live band since 1988 and frequent contributor to Nine Inch Nails studio recordings, left the act permanently to pursue a career in  |producing|Record_Producer|  and to form  |Tweaker|Tweaker| .            The Downward Spirals release date was delayed at various times to slow down Reznors intended pace of the albums recording. The first delay caused the process of setting up Le Pig to take longer than he expected, and its release was postponed again as he was educating himself different ways to write songs that did not resemble those on Broken and Pretty Hate Machine. He considered delivering the album to Interscope in early 1993, only to experience a  |writers_block|Writers_Block|  as he was unable to produce any satisfactory material. Interscope grew impatient and concerned with this progress, but Reznor was not forced by their demands of expediency despite crediting the label for giving him creative freedom. He told rock music producer  |Rick_Rubin|Rick_Rubin|  that his motivation for creating the album was to get it finished, thus Rubin responded that Reznor might not do so until he makes music that is allowed to be heard. Reznor realized that he was in the most fortunate situation he imagined when the album was recorded with a normal budget, cool equipment, and a studio to work at.     Released on March 8, 1994 to instant success, The Downward Spiral debuted at number two on the US  |Billboard_200|Billboard_200| , selling nearly 119,000 copies in its first week.  On October 28, 1998, the  |Recording_Industry_Association_of_America|Recording_Industry_Association_Of_America|  certified the album quadruple platinum, and by December 2011, it had sold 3.7 million copies in the United States. The album peaked at number nine on the  |UK_Albums_Chart|Uk_Albums_Chart| , and on July 22, 2013, it was certified gold by the  |British_Phonographic_Industry|British_Phonographic_Industry|  , denoting shipments in excess of 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. It reached number 13 on the Canadian  RPM  albums chart and received a triple platinum certification from the  |Canadian_Recording_Industry_Association|Canadian_Recording_Industry_Association|  for shipping 200,000 copies in Canada. A group of early listeners of the album viewed it as commercial suicide , but Reznor did not make it for profit as his goal was to slightly broaden Nine Inch Nails scope. Reznor felt that the finished product he delivered to Interscope was complete and faithful to his vision and thought its commercial potential was limited, but after its release he was surprised by the success and received questions about a follow-up single with a music video to be shown on MTV. The album has since sold over four million copies worldwide.      Many music critics and audiences praised The Downward Spiral for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes and commented on the concept of a destruction of a man. The New York Times writer Jon Pareles review of the album found the music to be highly abrasive. Pareles asserted that unlike other electro-industrial groups like  |Ministry|Ministry|  and  |Nitzer_Ebb|Nitzer_Ebb| , Reznor writes full-fledged tunes with stronger use of melodies than riffs. He noticed criticisms of Nine Inch Nails from industrial purists for popularizing the genre and the albums transgression.   Village Voice  critic  |Robert_Christgau|Robert_Christgau|  gave it an honorable mention in his  |capsule_review|Capsule_Review|  column and summed the record up as, musically,  |Hieronymus_Bosch|Hieronymus_Bosch|  as postindustrial atheist; lyrically,  |Transformers|Transformers|  as kiddie porn.  Jonathan Gold, writing for Rolling Stone, likened the album to cyberpunk fiction. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tom Sinclair commented: Reznors pet topics are all here, wrapped in hooks that hit your psyche with the force of a blowtorch.       The Downward Spiral has been listed on several publications best album lists. In 2003, the album was ranked number 201 on Rolling Stone magazines list of  |the_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time|The_500_Greatest_Albums_Of_All_Time|   maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. The Rolling Stone staff wrote: Holing up in the one-time home of Manson-family victim Sharon Tate, Trent Reznor made an overpowering meditation on NINs central theme: control.  The album was placed 10th on  Spin s 125 Best Albums of the Past 25 Years list; the Spin staff quoted Ann Powers review that appreciated its bleak, aggressive style.  It was ranked number 488 in the book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time by heavy metal music critic  |Martin_Popoff|Martin_Popoff| .  In 2001,  Q  named The Downward Spiral as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time;  in 2010, the album was ranked number 102 on their 250 Best Albums of Qs Lifetime  list.  The Downward Spiral was featured in Robert Dimerys book  1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .   In May 2014,  Loudwire  placed The Downward Spiral at number two on its 10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994 list.  In July 2014,  Guitar World  placed The Downward Spiral at number 43 in their Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994 list.           The immediate success of The Downward Spiral established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s. The bands image and musical style became so recognizable that a  |Gatorade|Gatorade|  commercial featured a remix of  |Down_in_It|Down_In_It|  without their involvement. Reznor felt uncomfortable with the media hype and success the band earned, received false reports of his death, depression, and was falsely reported to have had a relationship with serial killer  |Jeffrey_Dahmer|Jeffrey_Dahmer| , and was depicted as a sex icon due to his visual appearance. Nine Inch Nails received several honors, including Grammy Award nominations for  |Best_Alternative_Performance|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Alternative_Music_Album|  for The Downward Spiral and  |Best_Rock_Song|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Rock_Song|  for Hurt . After the release of The Downward Spiral, many bands such as  |Gravity_Kills|Gravity_Kills| ,  |Stabbing_Westward|Stabbing_Westward| ,  |Filter|Filter| , and  |Mötley_Crüe|Mötley_Crüe|  made albums that imitated the sound of Nine Inch Nails.       Reznor interpreted The Downward Spiral as an extension of himself that became the truth fulfilling itself, as he experienced personal and social issues presented in the album after its release. He had already struggled with  |social_anxiety_disorder|Social_Anxiety_Disorder|  and depression and started his abuse of  |narcotics|Narcotic|  including cocaine while he went on an alcohol binge. Around this time, his studio perfectionism,  struggles with addiction, and bouts of writers block prolonged the production of  The Fragile , and Reznor completed rehabilitation from drugs in 2001.       One year after The Downward Spiral’s release, the band released an accompanying remix album titled  Further Down the Spiral . It features contributions from  |Coil|Coil|  with  |Danny_Hyde|Danny_Hyde| ,  |J_G_Thirlwell|J_G_Thirlwell| , electronic musician  |Aphex_Twin|Aphex_Twin| , producer Rick Rubin, and Janes Addiction guitarist  |Dave_Navarro|Dave_Navarro| . The album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews.   Recoiled , a remix EP of  |Gave_Up|Gave_Up|  , Closer , The Downward Spiral , and Eraser by Coil, was released on February 24, 2014 via British record label  |Cold_Spring|Cold_Spring| .      Retrospective reviews regard The Downward Spiral as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and Reznors greatest work. The 2004 edition of  The New Rolling Stone Album Guide  gave the album five out of five stars and called it a powerful statement, and one of the landmark albums of the Nineties.  Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson remembered watching the music video of Closer on MTV as an adolescent and expressed that the album changed his perception of popular music from that of songs heard on the radio to albums with cover art.   Stereogum s Tom Breihan remains favorable toward the album since it is the one that most fully inhabits Nine Inch Nails characteristics and influenced youth culture, with teenagers wearing ripped fish nets on their arms. The album was also included in the book  1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .  According to  |Acclaimed_Music|Acclaimed_Music| , it is the 165th most acclaimed album, based on appearances in critics all-time lists.          The Downward Spirals emphasis on transgressive themes made its lyrics vulnerable to criticism from  |American_social_conservatives|Conservatism_In_The_United_Statessocial_Conservatism_And_Tradition| . Senator  |Bob_Dole|Bob_Dole| , then the head of the  |Republican_Party|Republican_Party| , sharply denounced  |Time_Warner|Time_Warner| , the former owner of Interscopes former parent company  |Warner_Music_Group|Warner_Music_Group| , after a meeting between  |Michael_J_Fuchs|Michael_J_Fuchs|  ,  |William_Bennett|William_Bennett| , and  |C_Delores_Tucker|C_Delores_Tucker| . Tucker and Bennett demanded Fuchs to recite lyrics from Big Man with a Gun , because they thought the song was an attack on American conservatives by metaphorically claiming within the lyrics they had a  |jingoistic|Jingoism|  agenda.  Interscope had previously been blamed for releasing  |gangsta_rap|Gangsta_Rap|  albums by rappers such as  |Dr_Dre|Dr_Dre| ,  |Tupac_Shakur|Tupac_Shakur| , and  |Snoop_Dogg|Snoop_Dogg|  that were deemed objectionable. Reznor called Tucker such a fucking idiot , and claimed that the song was actually a  |satire|Satire|  of the gangsta rap genre as a whole and was originally about madness. Reznor conceded The Downward Spiral could be harmful, through implying and subliminally suggesting things , whereas  |hardcore_hip_hop|Hardcore_Hip_Hop|  could be cartoonish .  Also posted at    |Robert_Bork|Robert_Bork|  also repeatedly referenced Big Man with a Gun in his book  Slouching Toward Gomorrah  as evidence of a cultural decline. The book also incorrectly states that it is a rap song.             Before the  |Columbine_High_School_massacre|Columbine_High_School_Massacre| , perpetrator  |Dylan_Klebold|Dylan_Klebold|  referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs multiple times in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The Downward Spiral as a symbol of his own depression.  On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the  |United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce_Science_and_Transportation|United_States_Senate_Committee_On_Commerce_Science_And_Transportation| .  The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of  |Denver|Denver_Colorado| , Reverend  |Charles_J_Chaput|Charles_J_Chaput| . Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails label-mate  |Marilyn_Manson|Marilyn_Manson| , and the 1999 film  The Matrix  for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the  |Federal_Trade_Commission|Federal_Trade_Commission|  and the  |United_States_Department_of_Justice|United_States_Department_Of_Justice|  investigate the entertainment industrys marketing practices to minors.        In 2009,  |Apple|Apple_Inc_|  rejected a proposal for a Nine Inch Nails  |iPhone|Iphone|  application, citing objectionable content in The Downward Spiral. Days later, Apple reversed the decision, but refused to explain its reasoning.               Notes  THX 1138  in which a man is being beaten by a prison guard.    The sample of screams that plays throughout The Becoming is from the film  Robot Jox , when a giant robot falls on a crowd of spectators.    The sample at the beginning of Big Man with a Gun comes from a studio-altered recording of a porn star having an orgasm. According to the album booklet, this sample is titled Steakhouse and is credited to  |Tommy_Lee|Tommy_Lee| .    Japanese pressings of the album contain a cover of  |Joy_Divisions|Joy_Division|  song Dead Souls , originally included on the  |soundtrack|The_Crow_Original_Motion_Picture_Soundtrack|  to the film  The Crow . The track is placed in between Big Man with a Gun and A Warm Place .

Affected tracks do not play at their beginnings when selected individually ; however, the disc plays and flows correctly as a whole.        To mark the albums tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc one of the albums deluxe edition re-release is nearly identical to the original version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel  |SACD|Super_Audio_Cd|  layer.
