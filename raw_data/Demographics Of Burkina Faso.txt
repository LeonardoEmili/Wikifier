This article is about the  |demographic|Demographics|  features of the  |population|Population|  of  |Burkina_Faso|Burkina_Faso| , including  |population_density|Population_Density| ,  |ethnicity|Ethnic_Group| , education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.         |Burkina_Fasos|Burkina_Faso|   million people belong to two major West African cultural groups—the  |Gur|Gur_People|  and the  |Mandé|Mandé| . The Voltaic are far more numerous and include the  |Mossi|Mossi_People| , who make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi are still bound by the traditions of the  |Mogho_Naba|Mogho_Naba| , who hold court in  |Ouagadougou|Ouagadougou| .     About 12,000 Europeans reside in Burkina Faso, the majority of whom are French.     Most of Burkina Fasos population is concentrated in the south and center of the country, with a population density sometimes exceeding . This population density, high for Africa, causes annual migrations of hundreds of thousands of Burkinabé to  |Ivory_Coast|Ivory_Coast|  and  |Ghana|Ghana|  for seasonal agricultural work. About a third of Burkinabé adhere to traditional African religions. The introduction of Islam to Burkina Faso was initially resisted by the Mossi rulers. Christians, predominantly  |Roman_Catholics|Roman_Catholic| , are largely concentrated among the urban elite.     Few Burkinabé have had formal education. Schooling is free but not compulsory, and only about 29% of Burkinas primary school-age children receive a basic education. The  |University_of_Ouagadougou|University_Of_Ouagadougou| , founded in 1974, was the countrys first institution of higher education. The  |Polytechnic_University_of_Bobo-Dioulasso|Polytechnic_University_Of_Bobo-Dioulasso|  in  |Bobo-Dioulasso|Bobo-Dioulasso|  was opened in 1995.          According to  the total population was  in , compared to only 4,284,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 45.3%, 52.4% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.2% was 65 years or older   .           Registration of vital events is in Burkina Faso not complete. The Population Departement of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.            Total Fertility Rate and Crude Birth Rate :                  Fertility data as of 2013 :                      Demographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2019.      One birth every 42 seconds	   One death every 3 minutes	   One net migrant every 21 minutes	   Net gain of one person every 55 seconds     The following demographic statistics are from the  |CIA_World_Factbook|Cia_World_Factbook| , unless otherwise indicated.        Burkina Faso has a young age structure – the result of declining mortality combined with steady high fertility – and continues to experience rapid population growth, which is putting increasing pressure on the country’s limited arable land. More than 65% of the population is under the age of 25, and the population is growing at 3% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of infants and children, have decreased because of improved health care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an average of almost 6 children. Even if fertility were substantially reduced, today’s large cohort entering their reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic prospects of Burkina Faso’s large working-age population.       :20,107,509   :Note   :0-14 years: 44.28%   :15-24 years: 20.19%   :25-54 years: 28.82%   :55-64 years: 3.55%   :65 years and over: 3.16%     :0-14 years: 44.88%   :15-24 years: 20.07%   :25-54 years: 29.42%   :55-64 years: 3.2%   :65 years and over: 2.43%       :total: 17.4 years Country comparison to the world: 218th   :male: 16.6 years   :female: 18.2 years     :Total: 17.3 years   :Male: 17.1 years   :Female: 17.4 years       :2.76% Country comparison to the world: 12th   :3%       :36.9 births/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 14th       :8.7 deaths/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 72nd       :0 migrant/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 76th       :19.4 years   :note: median age at first birth among women 25-29      |Total_fertility_rate|Total_Fertility_Rate|  Contraceptive prevalence rate Urbanization Sex ratio       :total population: 61.8 years   :male: 60.1 years   :female: 63.6 years       :Adult prevalence rate: 1.6%   :People living with  |HIV|Hiv| / |AIDS|Aids| |diarrhea|Diarrhea| ,  |hepatitis_A|Hepatitis_A| , and  |typhoid_fever|Typhoid_Fever|    :Vectorborne disease:  |malaria|Malaria|  and  |yellow_fever|Yellow_Fever|    :Water contact disease:  |schistosomiasis|Schistosomiasis|    :Respiratory disease:  |meningococcal_meningitis|Meningococcal_Meningitis|    :Animal contact diseases:  |rabies|Rabies|        :Noun: Burkinabé   :Adjective: Burkinabé          : |Mossi|Mossi_People|   52.5%,  |Fulani|Fula_People|  8.4%,  |Gurma|Gurma_People|  6.8%,  |Bobo|Bobo_People|  4.8%,  |Gurunsi|Gurunsi_Peoples|  4.5%,  |Senufo|Senufo_People|  4.4%,  |Bissa|Bissa_People|  3.9%,  |Lobi|Lobi_People|  2.5%,  |Dagara|Dagaaba_People|  2.4%,  |Tuareg|Tuareg_People|  / |Ikelan|Ikelan|  1.9%,  |Dioula|Diola_People|  0.8%, Unspecified /No answer 0.1%, Other 7%          : |Islam|Islam_In_Burkina_Faso|  61.6%,  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  23.2%,  |Traditional|Traditional_African_Religion|  / |Animist|Animism|  7.3%,  |Protestant|Protestant|  6.7%, Other/No Answer 0.2%, None 0.9%          : |French|French_Language|  , native  |African_languages|African_Languages|  belonging to  |Sudanic_family|Sudanic_Languages|  spoken by 90% of the population       :Definition: age 15 and over can read and write   :Total population: 36%   :Male: 43%   :Female: 29.3%          In 2018, an estimated 82,000 people in the country were living under modern slavery according to the Global Slavery Index.  News reports also indicate that most child slaves on cocoa farms come from Mali and Burkina Faso, two of the poorest nations on Earth. The children, some as young as ten, are sent by their families or trafficked by agents with the promise of money. They are made to work long hours for little or no money.
