The bands original lineup, originally named Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, featured guitarist  |Hillel_Slovak|Hillel_Slovak|  and drummer  |Jack_Irons|Jack_Irons| , alongside Kiedis and Flea. Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the bands 1984  |self_titled_debut_album|The_Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers| . Slovak performed on the second and third albums,  Freaky Styley  and  The Uplift Mofo Party Plan  , but he died from a heroin  |overdose|Drug_Overdose|  in 1988. As a result of his friends death, Irons chose to leave the group. After short-lived replacements on guitar and drums,  |John_Frusciante|John_Frusciante|  and Smith joined in 1988. The lineup of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante, and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with  Mothers Milk  . In 1990, the group signed with  |Warner_Bros_Records|Warner_Bros_Records|  and recorded the album  Blood Sugar Sex Magik  under producer  |Rick_Rubin|Rick_Rubin| . This album became the bands first major commercial success, but Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the bands popularity and left abruptly in 1992 in the middle of the  |Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik_Tour|Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik_Tour| .     After two temporary guitarists,  |Dave_Navarro|Dave_Navarro|  joined the group in 1993 and played on their subsequent album,  One Hot Minute  . Although commercially successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, selling less than half as much as its predecessor. Navarro was fired from the band in 1998.  Frusciante, fresh out of  |drug_rehabilitation|Drug_Rehabilitation| , rejoined the band that same year at Fleas request. The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record  Californication  , which became the bands biggest commercial success with 16 million copies sold worldwide.
