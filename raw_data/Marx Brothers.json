Woollcott did not meet the Marx Brothers until the premiere of  Ill Say She Is , which was their first Broadway show, so this would mean that they used their real names throughout their vaudeville days, and that the name Gummo never appeared in print during his time in the act. Other sources reported that the Marx Brothers went by their nicknames during their vaudeville era, but briefly listed themselves by their given names when Ill Say She Is opened because they were worried that a Broadway audience would reject a vaudeville act if they were perceived as low class.
