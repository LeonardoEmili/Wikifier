Management science  is the broad interdisciplinary study of problem solving and decision making in human organizations, with strong links to  management ,  |economics|Economics| ,  |business|Business| ,  |engineering|Engineering| ,  |management_consulting|Management_Consulting| , and other fields. It uses various scientific  |research|Research| -based  |principles|Principles| ,  |strategies|Strategies| , and  |analytical_methods|Analytical_Method|  including  |mathematical_model|Mathematical_Model| ing,  |statistics|Statistics|  and  |numerical_algorithms|Numerical_Algorithm|  to improve an organizations ability to enact rational and accurate  |management|Management|  decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems. Management science helps businesses to achieve goals using various scientific methods.     The field was initially an outgrowth of  |applied_mathematics|Applied_Mathematics| , where early challenges were problems relating to the  |optimization|Optimization|  of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima  of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which the problem can be structured as a functional system so as to obtain a solution set with identifiable characteristics.       Management science is concerned with a number of different areas of study: One is developing and applying  |models|Scientific_Modeling|  and  |concepts|Concept|  that may prove useful in helping to illuminate  |management|Management|  issues and solve managerial problems. The models used can often be represented mathematically, but sometimes computer-based,  |visual|Visual|  or  |verbal|Speech|  representations are used as well or instead.  Lancaster University, 2008.

Management science research can be done on three levels:  University of Cambridge 2008. Retrieved 5 June 2008.   The fundamental level lies in three mathematical disciplines:  |probability|Probability| ,  |optimization|Optimization| , and  |dynamical_systems_theory|Dynamical_Systems_Theory| .   The modeling level is about building models, analyzing them mathematically, gathering and analyzing data, implementing models on computers, solving them, experimenting with them  all this is part of management science research on the modeling level. This level is mainly instrumental, and driven mainly by  |statistics|Statistics|  and  |econometrics|Econometrics| .   The application level, just as in any other  |engineering|Engineering|  and  |economics|Economics|  disciplines, strives to make a practical impact and be a driver for change in the real world.     The management scientists mandate is to use rational, systematic, science-based techniques to inform and improve decisions of all kinds. The techniques of management science are not restricted to business applications but may be applied to  |military|Military| , medical,  |public_administration|Public_Administration| , charitable groups, political groups or community groups.       Its origins can be traced to  |operations_research|Operations_Research| , which became influential during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  when the Allied forces recruited scientists of various disciplines to assist with military operations. In these early applications, the scientists used simple mathematical models to make efficient use of limited technologies and resources. The application of these models to the corporate sector became known as management science.  The University of Tennessee, 2006. Retrieved 5 June 2008.     In 1967  |Stafford_Beer|Stafford_Beer|  characterized the field of management science as the business use of operations research .  |Stafford_Beer|Stafford_Beer|  . Management Science: The Business Use of Operations Research       Some of the fields that management science involves include:     |Data_mining|Data_Mining| |Decision_analysis|Decision_Analysis| |Engineering|Engineering| |Forecasting|Forecasting| |Game_theory|Game_Theory| |Industrial_engineering|Industrial_Engineering| |Logistics|Logistics| |Mathematical_modeling|Mathematical_Modeling| |Optimization|Optimization| |Operational_research|Operational_Research| |Probability_and_statistics|Probability_And_Statistics| |Project_management|Project_Management| |Psychology|Psychology| |Simulation|Simulation| |Social_network|Social_Network|  /  |Transportation_forecasting|Transportation_Forecasting|  models    |Sociology|Sociology| |Supply_chain_management|Supply_Chain_Management| |Management_consulting|Management_Consulting|       as well as many others.          Applications of management science are abundant in industries such as  |airlines|Airlines| ,  |manufacturing|Manufacturing|  companies,  |service_organizations|Service_Organization| , military branches, and in  |government|Government| . Management science has contributed insights and solutions to a vast range of problems and issues, including:    |scheduling|Scheduling|  airlines, both planes and crew   deciding the appropriate place to site new facilities such as a warehouse or factory   managing the flow of water from reservoirs   identifying possible future development paths for parts of the telecommunications industry   establishing the information needs of health services and appropriate systems to supply them   identifying and understanding the strategies adopted by companies for their  |information_systems|Information_System|      Management science is also concerned with so-called soft-operational analysis, which concerns methods for  |strategic_planning|Strategic_Planning| , strategic  |decision_support|Decision_Support| , and  |problem_structuring_methods|Problem_Structuring_Methods|  . At this level of abstraction, mathematical modeling and simulation will not suffice. Therefore, since the late 20th century, new non-quantified modelling methods have been developed, including  |morphological_analysis|Morphological_Analysis|  and various forms of  |influence_diagram|Influence_Diagram|.
