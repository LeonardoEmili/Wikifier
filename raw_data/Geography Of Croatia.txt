         The Geography of Croatia is defined by its location—it is described as a part of  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe|  and  |Southeast_Europe|Southeast_Europe| , a part of the  |Balkans|Balkans|  and  |Mitteleuropa|Mitteleuropa| . Croatias territory covers , making it the 127th largest country in the world. Bordered by  |Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina|  and  |Serbia|Serbia|  in the east,  |Slovenia|Slovenia|  in the west,  |Hungary|Hungary|  in the north and  |Montenegro|Montenegro|  and the Adriatic Sea in the south, it lies mostly between latitudes  |42°|42Nd_Parallel_North|  and  |47°_N|47Th_Parallel_North|  and longitudes  |13°|13Th_Meridian_East|  and  |20°_E|20Th_Meridian_East| .  |Croatias|Croatia| |_territorial_waters|Territorial_Waters|  encompass  in a  wide zone, and its  |internal_waters|Internal_Waters|  located within the  |baseline|Baseline|  cover an additional .     The  |Pannonian_Basin|Pannonian_Basin|  and the  |Dinaric_Alps|Dinaric_Alps| , along with the Adriatic Basin, represent major  |geomorphological|Geomorphology|  parts of Croatia. Lowlands make up the bulk of Croatia, with elevations of less than  above sea level recorded in 53.42% of the country. Most of the lowlands are found in the northern regions, especially in  |Slavonia|Slavonia| , itself a part of the Pannonian Basin plain. The plains are interspersed with  |horst|Horst|  and  |graben|Graben|  structures, believed to have broken the  |Pliocene|Pliocene| |Pannonian_Seas|Pannonian_Sea|  surface as  |islands|Pannonian_Island_Mountains| . The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in the  |Lika|Lika|  and  |Gorski_Kotar|Gorski_Kotar|  areas in the Dinaric Alps, but high areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent. The Dinaric Alps contain the highest mountain in Croatia— Dinara—as well as all other mountains in Croatia higher than . Croatias Adriatic Sea mainland coast is  long, while its  |1_246_islands|List_Of_Islands_Of_Croatia|  and islets encompass a further  of coastline—the most indented coastline in the Mediterranean.  |Karst_topography|Karst_Topography|  makes up  |about_half_of_Croatia|List_Of_Notable_Karst_Areascroatia|  and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps, as well as throughout the coastal areas and the islands.     62% of Croatias territory is encompassed by the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea| |_drainage_basin|Drainage_Basin| . The area includes the largest rivers flowing in the country: the  |Danube|Danube| , Sava,  |Drava|Drava| ,  |Mur|Mur|  and  |Kupa|Kupa| . The remainder belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin, where the largest river by far is the  |Neretva|Neretva| . Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy  |continental_climate|Continental_Climate|  as defined by the  |Köppen_climate_classification|Köppen_Climate_Classification| . The mean monthly temperature ranges between  and . Croatia has a number of  |ecoregions|Ecoregion|  because of its climate and geomorphology, and the country is consequently among the most biodiverse in Europe. There are four types of  |biogeographical|Biogeographical|  regions in Croatia: Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland; Alpine in the  |elevated|Altitudinal_Zonation|  Lika and Gorski Kotar; Pannonian along the Drava and Danube; and Continental in the remaining areas. There are 444   |protected_natural_areas_in_Croatia|Protected_Areas_Of_Croatia| , encompassing 8.5% of the country; there are about 37,000 known species in Croatia, and the total number of species is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.     The permanent population of Croatia by the 2011 census reached 4.29  million. The  |population_density|Population_Density|  was 75.8  inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall  |life_expectancy_in_Croatia|List_Of_Countries_By_Life_Expectancy|  at birth was 75.7  years. The country is inhabited mostly by  |Croats|Croats|  , while  |minorities|Ethnic_Minorities_In_Croatia|  include  |Serbs|Serbs|  , and 21 other ethnicities recognised by the  |constitution|Constitution_Of_Croatia| . Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into 20  |counties|Counties_Of_Croatia|  and the capital  |city_of_Zagreb|City_Of_Zagreb| . The counties subdivide into 127  |cities|List_Of_Cities_In_Croatia|  and 429  |municipalities|Municipalities_Of_Croatia| . The average  |urbanisation|Urbanisation|  rate in Croatia stands at 56%, with a growing urban population and shrinking rural population. The largest city and the nations  |capital|Capital_City|  is  |Zagreb|Zagreb| , with an urban population of 686,568 in the city itself and a  |metropolitan_area|Metropolitan_Area|  population of 978,161. The populations of  |Split|Split_Croatia|  and  |Rijeka|Rijeka|  exceed 100,000, and five more cities in Croatia have populations over 50,000.       Croatias territory covers ,  making it the 127th largest country in the world.  The physical geography of Croatia is defined by its location—it is described as a part of  |Southeast_Europe|Southeast_Europe|   Croatia borders  |Bosnia–Herzegovina|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina|  and  |Serbia|Serbia|  in the east,  |Slovenia|Slovenia|  for 667.8  km in the west,  |Hungary|Hungary|  for 355.5  km in the north and  |Montenegro|Montenegro|  for 22.6  km and the  |Adriatic_Sea|Adriatic_Sea|  in the south.   It lies mostly between latitudes  |42°|42Nd_Parallel_North|  and  |47°_N|47Th_Parallel_North|  and longitudes  |13°|13Th_Meridian_East|  and  |20°_E|20Th_Meridian_East| . Part of the extreme south of Croatia is separated from the rest of the mainland by a short coastline strip around  |Neum|Neum|  belonging to Bosnia–Herzegovina.      Croatias  border with Hungary was inherited from  |Yugoslavia|Sfr_Yugoslavia| . Much of the border with Hungary follows the  |Drava|Drava|  River or its former river bed; that part of the border dates from the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| . The border in  |Međimurje|Međimurje|  and  |Baranya|Baranya|  was defined as a border between the  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary|  and the  |Kingdom_of_Serbs_Croats_and_Slovenes|Kingdom_Of_Serbs_Croats_And_Slovenes| , later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, pursuant to the  |Treaty_of_Trianon|Treaty_Of_Trianonborders_Of_Hungary|  of 1920.   The present outline of the  border with Bosnia–Herzegovina and  border with Montenegro is largely the result of the  |Ottoman_conquest|Hundred_Years_Croatian–Ottoman_War|  and subsequent recapture of territories in the  |Great_Turkish_War|Great_Turkish_War|  of 1667–1698 formally ending with the  |Treaty_of_Karlowitz|Treaty_Of_Karlowitz| , as well as the  |Fifth|Cretan_War|  and  |Seventh_Ottoman–Venetian_Wars|Ottoman–Venetian_War| .  This border had minor modifications in 1947 when all borders of the former Yugoslav constituent republics were defined by demarcation commissions implementing the  |AVNOJ|Avnoj|  decisions of 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organisation of Yugoslavia. The commissions also defined Baranya and Međimurje as Croatian territories, and moreover set up the present-day  border between Serbia and Croatia in  |Syrmia|Syrmia|  and along the  |Danube|Danube|  River between  |Ilok|Ilok|  and the Drava rivers mouth and further north to the Hungarian border; the Ilok/Drava section matched the border between the  |Kingdom_of_Croatia_Slavonia|Kingdom_Of_Croatia_Slavonia|  and  |Bács_Bodrog_County|Bács_Bodrog_County|  that existed until 1918 . Most of the  border with Slovenia was also defined by the commissions, matching the northwestern border of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia,  and establishing a new section of Croatian border north of the  |Istria|Istria| n peninsula according to the ethnic composition of the territory previously belonging to the  |Kingdom_of_Italy|Kingdom_Of_Italy| .      Pursuant to the  |1947_Treaty_of_Peace_with_Italy|Treaty_Of_Peace_With_Italy_1947|  the islands of  |Cres|Creshistory| ,  |Lastovo|Lastovo|  and  |Palagruža|Palagruža|  and the cities of  |Zadar|Zadarhistory|  and  |Rijeka|Rijeka|  and most of Istria went to  |communist_Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia|  and Croatia, while carving out the  |Free_Territory_of_Trieste|Free_Territory_Of_Trieste|  as a city-state.  The FTT was partitioned in 1954 as  |Trieste|Trieste|  itself and the area to the north of it were placed under Italian control, and the rest under Yugoslav control. The arrangement was made permanent by the  |Treaty_of_Osimo|Treaty_Of_Osimo|  in 1975. The former FTTs Yugoslav part was partitioned between Croatia and Slovenia, largely conforming to the area populations ethnic composition.      In the late 19th century,  |Austria_Hungary|Austria_Hungary|  established a  |geodetic_network|Geodetic_Network| , for which the  |elevation_benchmark|Metres_Above_The_Adriatic|  was determined by the Adriatic Seas average level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste. This benchmark was subsequently retained by  |Austria|Austria| , adopted by  |Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia| , and kept by the states that emerged after its dissolution, including Croatia.                 The geographical extreme points of  |Croatia|Croatia|  are  |Žabnik|Žabnik|  in  |Međimurje_County|Međimurje_County|  as the northernmost point,  |Rađevac|Rađevac|  near Ilok in  |Vukovar_Syrmia_County|Vukovar_Syrmia_County|  as the easternmost point, Cape Lako near  |Bašanija|Bašanija|  in  |Istria_County|Istria_County|  as the westernmost point and the islet of  |Galijula|Galijula|  in Palagruža archipelago in  |Split_Dalmatia_County|Split_Dalmatia_County|  as the southernmost point. On the mainland, Cape Oštra of the  |Prevlaka|Prevlaka|  peninsula in  |Dubrovnik_Neretva_County|Dubrovnik_Neretva_County|  is the southernmost point.                  Italy and Yugoslavia defined their delineation of the  |continental_shelf|Continental_Shelf|  in the Adriatic Sea in 1968, with an additional agreement on the boundary in the Gulf of Trieste signed in 1975 in accordance with the Treaty of Osimo. All the successor states of former Yugoslavia accepted the agreements. Prior to Yugoslavias break-up, Albania, Italy and Yugoslavia initially proclaimed   |territorial_waters|Territorial_Waters| , subsequently reduced to the international-standard ; all sides adopted  |baseline|Baseline|  systems. Croatia also declared its  |Ecological_and_Fisheries_Protection_Zone|Ecological_And_Fisheries_Protection_Zone|  —a part of its  |Exclusive_Economic_Zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone| —as extending to the continental shelf boundary. Croatias territorial waters encompass ; its  |internal_waters|Internal_Waters|  located within the baseline cover an additional .               Croatia and Slovenia started negotiations to define maritime borders in the  |Gulf_of_Piran|Gulf_Of_Piran|  in 1992 but failed to agree, resulting in a dispute. Both countries also declared their economic zones, which partially overlap.  Croatias application to become an  |EU_member_state|Member_State_Of_The_European_Union|  was initially suspended pending resolution of its border disputes with Slovenia.  These were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an  |international_arbitration|International_Arbitration|  commission set up via the  |UN|United_Nations| , enabling Croatia to  |progress_towards_EU_membership|Accession_Of_Croatia_To_The_European_Union| .   The dispute has caused no major practical problems in areas other than the EU membership negotiations progress, even before the arbitration agreement.     The maritime boundary between Bosnia–Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999, but a few issues are still contested—the  |Klek_peninsula|Klek|  and two islets in the border area. The Croatia–Montenegro maritime boundary is disputed in the  |Bay_of_Kotor|Bay_Of_Kotor| , at the Prevlaka peninsula. The situation was exacerbated by the peninsulas occupation by the  |Yugoslav_Peoples_Army|Yugoslav_Peoples_Army|  and later by the  |Serbian_Montenegrin_army|Military_Of_Serbia_And_Montenegro| , which in turn was replaced by a  |United_Nations_observer_mission|United_Nations_Mission_Of_Observers_In_Prevlaka|  that lasted until 2002. Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in Croatian waters in the bay, and the dispute has become far less contentious since the independence of Montenegro in 2006.       The land border disputes pertain to comparatively small strips of land. The  |Croatia–Slovenia_border_disputes|Croatia–Slovenia_Border_Disputes|  are: along the  |Dragonja|Dragonja|  Rivers lower course where Slovenia claims three  |hamlets|Hamlet|  on the rivers left bank; the  |Sveta_Gera|Sveta_Gera|  peak of Žumberak where exact territorial claims were never made and appear to be limited to a military barracks on the peak itself; and along the  |Mura_River|Mur|  where Slovenia wants the border to be along the current river bed instead of along a former one and claims a piece of land near  |Hotiza|Hotiza| .   These claims are likewise in the process of being settled by binding arbitration.      There are also land  |border_disputes_between_Croatia_and_Serbia|Croatia_Serbia_Border_Dispute| . The two countries presently control one bank of the present-day river each, but Croatia claims that the border line should follow the  |cadastral|Cadastral|  borders between the former municipalities of  |SR_Croatia|Sr_Croatia|  and  |SR_Serbia|Sr_Serbia|  along the Danube, as defined by a Yugoslav commission in 1947 ; borders claimed by Croatia also include the  |Vukovar|Island_Of_Vukovar|  and  |Šarengrad|Island_Of_Šarengrad|  islands in the Danube as its territory.  There is also a border dispute with Bosnia–Herzegovina,  specifically Croatia claims Unčica  |channel|Meander|  on the right bank of  |Una|Una|  as the border at  |Hrvatska_Kostajnica|Hrvatska_Kostajnica| ,  while Bosnia and Herzegovina claims Una River course as the border there.               Most of Croatia is lowlands, with elevations of less than  above sea level recorded in 53.42% of the country. Most of the lowlands are found in the countrys northern regions, especially in  |Slavonia|Slavonia| , representing a part of the  |Pannonian_Basin|Pannonian_Basin| . Areas with elevations of  above sea level encompass 25.61% of Croatias territory, and the areas between  above sea level cover 17.11% of the country. A further 3.71% of the land is  above sea level, and only 0.15% of Croatias territory is elevated greater than  above sea level. The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in the  |Lika|Lika|  and  |Gorski_Kotar|Gorski_Kotar|  areas in the  |Dinaric_Alps|Dinaric_Alps| , but such areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent. The Pannonian Basin and the Dinaric Alps, along with the Adriatic Basin, represent major  |geomorphological|Geomorphology|  parts of Croatia.              Croatias Adriatic Sea mainland coast is  long, while its  |1_246_islands|List_Of_Islands_Of_Croatia|  and islets have a further  of coastline. The distance between the extreme points of Croatias coastline is . The number of islands includes all islands, islets, and rocks of all sizes, including ones emerging only at  |low_tide|Low_Tide| .  The largest islands in the Adriatic are  |Cres|Cres|  and  |Krk|Krk| , each covering ; the tallest is  |Brač|Brač| , reaching  above sea level. The islands include 47  |permanently_inhabited_ones|List_Of_Inhabited_Islands_Of_Croatia| , the most populous among them being Krk and  |Korčula|Korčula| .      The shore is the most indented coastline in the Mediterranean.  The majority of the coast is characterised by a  |karst_topography|Karst_Topography| , developed from the  |Adriatic_Carbonate_Platform|Adriatic_Carbonate_Platform| . Karstification there largely began after the final raising of the  |Dinarides|Dinarides|  in the  |Oligocene|Oligocene|  and  |Miocene|Miocene| |_epochs|Epoch| , when  |carbonate_rock|Carbonate_Rock|  was exposed to atmospheric effects such as rain; this extended to  below the present sea level, exposed during the  |Last_Glacial_Maximums|Last_Glacial_Maximum|  sea level drop. It is estimated that some karst formations are related to earlier drops of sea level, most notably the  |Messinian_salinity_crisis|Messinian_Salinity_Crisis| .  The eastern coasts largest part consists of carbonate rocks, while  |flysch|Flysch|  rock is significantly represented in the Gulf of Trieste coast, on the  |Kvarner_Gulf|Kvarner_Gulf|  coast opposite Krk, and in Dalmatia north of Split.  There are comparably small  |alluvial|Alluvial|  areas of the Adriatic coast in Croatia—most notably the  |Neretva|Neretva| |_river_delta|River_Delta| .  Western  |Istria|Istriageography|  is gradually subsiding, having sunk about  in the past 2,000  years.      In the Middle Adriatic Basin, there is evidence of  |Permian|Permian|  volcanism in the area of  |Komiža|Komiža|  on the island of  |Vis|Vis| , in addition to the volcanic islands of  |Jabuka|Jabuka|  and  |Brusnik|Brusnik| .  Earthquakes are frequent in the area around the Adriatic Sea, although most are too faint to be felt; an earthquake doing significant damage happens every few decades, with major earthquakes every few centuries.           The Dinaric Alps are linked to a Late  |Jurassic|Jurassic|  to recent times  |fold_and_thrust_belt|Fold_And_Thrust_Belt| , itself part of the  |Alpine_orogeny|Alpine_Orogeny| , extending southeast from the southern  |Alps|Alps| .  The Dinaric Alps in Croatia encompass the entire Gorski Kotar and Lika regions, as well as considerable parts of  |Dalmatia|Dalmatia| , with their northeastern edge running from   |Žumberak|Žumberak|  to the  |Banovina_region|Banovina| , along the Sava River,  and their westernmost landforms being   |Ćićarija|Ćićarija|  and   |Učka|Učka|  mountains in Istria. The Dinaric Alps contain the highest mountain in Croatia—  |Dinara|Dinara| —as well as all other mountains in Croatia higher than  |Biokovo|Biokovo| ,  |Velebit|Velebit| ,  |Plješivica|Plješivica| ,  |Velika_Kapela|Velika_Kapela| ,  |Risnjak|Risnjak| ,  |Svilaja|Svilaja|  and  |Snježnik|Snježnik| .     Karst topography makes up about  |half_of_Croatia|List_Of_Karst_Areas|  and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps.  There are  |numerous_caves_in_Croatia|List_Of_Caves_In_Croatia| , 49 of which are deeper than , 14 deeper than  and 3 deeper than .  The longest cave in Croatia,  |Kita_Gaćešina|Kita_Gaćešina| , is at the same time the longest cave in the Dinaric Alps at .                    The Pannonian Basin took shape through Miocenian thinning and  |subsidence|Subsidence|  of crust structures formed during the Late  |Paleozoic|Paleozoic| |_Variscan_orogeny|Variscan_Orogeny| . The Paleozoic and  |Mesozoic|Mesozoic|  structures are visible in  |Papuk|Papuk|  and other Slavonian mountains. The processes also led to the formation of a  |stratovolcanic|Stratovolcano|  chain in the basin 12–17   |Mya|Mya| ; intensified subsidence was observed until 5  Mya as well as  |flood_basalts|Flood_Basalt|  at about 7.5  Mya. The contemporary  |tectonic_uplift|Tectonic_Uplift|  of the  |Carpathian_Mountains|Carpathian_Mountains|  severed water flow to the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea|  and the  |Pannonian_Sea|Pannonian_Sea|  formed in the basin.  |Sediments|Sedimentationgeology|  were transported to the basin from the uplifting Carpathian and Dinaric mountains, with particularly deep  |fluvial|Fluvial|  sediments being deposited in the  |Pleistocene|Pleistocene|  epoch during the  |Transdanubian_Mountains|Transdanubian_Mountains|  formation.  Ultimately, up to  of sediment was deposited in the basin, and the sea eventually drained through the  |Iron_Gate|Iron_Gate|  gorge.      The results are large plains in eastern Slavonias  |Baranya|Baranya_Geography|  and  |Syrmia|Syrmiageography|  regions, as well as in river valleys, especially along the  |Sava|Sava| , Drava and  |Kupa|Kupa| . The plains are interspersed by  |horst|Horst|  and  |graben|Graben|  structures, believed to have broken the Pannonian Seas surface as  |islands|Pannonian_Island_Mountains| .  The tallest among such landforms are   |Ivanšćica|Ivanšćica|  and   |Medvednica|Medvednica|  north of  |Zagreb|Zagrebsurroundings| —both are also at least partially in  |Hrvatsko_Zagorje|Hrvatsko_Zagorje| —as well as   |Psunj|Psunj|  and  Papuk that are the tallest among the Slavonian mountains surrounding  |Požega|Požega_Croatia| . Psunj, Papuk and adjacent  |Krndija|Krndija|  consist mostly of Paleozoic rocks from 300–350  Mya.  |Požeška_gora|Požeška_Gora| , adjacent to Psunj, consists of much more recent  |Neogene|Neogene|  rocks, but there are also Upper  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  sediments and  |igneous_rocks|Igneous_Rocks|  forming the main,   |ridge|Ridge|  of the hill; these represent the largest igneous  |landform|Landform|  in Croatia. A smaller piece of igneous terrain is also present on Papuk, near  |Voćin|Voćin| .  The two, as well as the  |Moslavačka_gora|Moslavačka_Gora|  mountains, are possibly remnants of a  |volcanic_arc|Volcanic_Arc|  from the same  |tectonic_plate|Plate_Tectonics|  collision that caused the Dinaric Alps.             The largest part of Croatia—62% of its territory—is encompassed by the Black Sea  |drainage_basin|Drainage_Basin| . The area includes the largest rivers flowing in the country: the  |Danube|Danubegeology| , Sava, Drava,  |Mura|Mur_River_Course|  and Kupa. The rest belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin, where the largest river by far is the Neretva.   The longest rivers in Croatia are the  Sava,  Drava,  Kupa and a  section of the Danube. The longest rivers emptying into the Adriatic Sea are the   |Cetina|Cetina|  and an only  section of the Neretva.     The largest lakes in Croatia are   |Lake_Vrana|Lake_Vrana|  located in the northern Dalmatia,   |Lake_Dubrava|Lake_Dubrava|  near  |Varaždin|Varaždin| ,   |Peruća_Lake|Peruća_Lake|   on the Cetina River,   |Lake_Prokljan|Lake_Prokljan|  near  |Skradin|Skradin|  and   |Lake_Varaždin|Lake_Varaždin|  reservoir through which the Drava River flows near Varaždin. Croatias most famous lakes are the  |Plitvice_lakes|Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park| , a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over  |dolomite|Dolomite|  and  |limestone|Limestone|  cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue. Croatia has a remarkable wealth in terms of wetlands. Four of those are included in the  |Ramsar_list_of_internationally_important_wetlands|List_Of_Ramsar_Wetlands_Of_International_Importance| |Lonjsko_Polje|Lonjsko_Polje|  along the Sava and  |Lonja|Lonja|  rivers near  |Sisak|Sisak| ,  |Kopački_Rit|Kopački_Rit|  at the confluence of the Drava and Danube, the  |Neretva_Delta|Neretva_Delta|  and  |Crna_Mlaka|Crna_Mlaka|  near  |Jastrebarsko|Jastrebarsko| .     Average annual precipitation and evaporation rates are  and , respectively. Taking into consideration the overall water balance, the total Croatian water resources amount to  per year per capita, including  per year per capita from sources inside Croatia.                Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy  |oceanic_climate_|Oceanic_Climate|  as defined by the  |Köppen_climate_classification|Köppen_Climate_Classification| . Mean monthly temperatures range between  and  . The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar where a snowy forested climate is found at elevations above . The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland, which are characterised by a  |Mediterranean_climate|Mediterranean_Climate|  since temperatures are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas: the lowest temperature of  was recorded on 4 February 1929 in  |Gospić|Gospić| , and the highest temperature of  was recorded on 5 August 1981 in  |Ploče|Ploče| .     The mean annual precipitation is  depending on the geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands  and in the eastern parts of Slavonia; however, in the latter case it is mostly during the  |growing_season|Growing_Season| . The most precipitation is observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski Kotar, where some of the highest annual precipitation totals in Europe occur.     The prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest; in the coastal area, the prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as cool northeasterly  |buras|Bora|  or, less frequently, as warm southerly  |jugos|Jugo| . The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2,700  hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general, northern Adriatic coast, and Slavonia, all with more than 2,000  hours of sunshine per year.                  Croatia can be subdivided between a number of  |ecoregions|Ecoregion|  because of its climate and geomorphology, and the country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of  |biogeographical|Biogeography|  regions in Croatia: Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along the Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas.  Among the most significant are  |karst|Karst|  habitats; these include submerged karst, such as  |Zrmanja|Zrmanja|  and  |Krka|Krka|  canyons and  |tufa|Tufa|  barriers, as well as underground habitats. The karst geology has produced approximately 7,000 caves and pits, many of which are inhabited by  |troglobitic|Troglobite|  animals such as the  |olm|Olm| , a  |cave_salamander|Cave_Salamander|  and the only European troglobitic  |vertebrate|Vertebrate| .  Forests are also significant in the country, as they cover  representing 46.8% of Croatias land surface. The other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.  In terms of  |phytogeography|Phytogeography| , Croatia is part of the  |Boreal_Kingdom|Boreal_Kingdom| ; specifically, it is part of the Illyrian and Central European provinces of the  |Circumboreal_Region|Circumboreal_Region|  and the Adriatic province of the  |Mediterranean_Region|Mediterranean_Region| . The  |World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature|Biomewwf_System|  divides land in Croatia into three ecoregions— |Pannonian_mixed_forests|Pannonian_Mixed_Forests| ,  |Dinaric_Mountains_mixed_forests|Dinaric_Mountains_Mixed_Forests|  and  |Illyrian_deciduous_forests|Illyrian_Deciduous_Forests| .   |Biomes|Biome|  in Croatia include  |temperate_broadleaf_mixed_forest|Temperate_Broadleaf_And_Mixed_Forest|  and  |Mediterranean_forests_woodlands_and_scrub|Mediterranean_Forests_Woodlands_And_Scrub| ; all are in the  |Palearctic_ecozone|Palearctic_Ecozone| .         Croatia has 38,226 known  |taxa|Taxon| , 2.8% of which are  |endemic|Endemism| ; the actual number  is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The estimate is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of  |invertebrates|Invertebrate|  discovered in Croatia in 2000–2005 alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in the Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species. Indigenous  |cultivars|Cultivar|  of plants and  |breeds|Breed|  of domesticated animals are also numerous; they include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.          There are 444  |Croatian_protected_areas|Croatian_Protected_Areas| , encompassing 8.5% of the country. These include 8  |national_parks|List_Of_National_Parks_Of_Croatia| , 2 strict  |reserves|Nature_Reserve|  and 11  |nature_parks|Nature_Park| , accounting for 78% of the total protected area. The most famous protected area and the oldest  |national_park|National_Park|  in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a  |UNESCO|Unesco| |_World_Heritage_Site|World_Heritage_Site| . Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO  |Man_and_the_Biosphere_Programme|Man_And_The_Biosphere_Programme| . The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up as the first step in preparation for EU membership and joining the  |Natura_2000|Natura_2000|  network.      |Habitat_destruction|Habitat_Destruction|  represents a threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural  |habitats|Habitat| , while  |habitat_fragmentation|Habitat_Fragmentation|  occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of  |invasive_species|Invasive_Species| , with  Caulerpa racemosa  and  C. taxifolia  identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the  |benthic_habitat|Benthic_Zone| . Agricultural  |monocultures|Monoculture|  have also been identified as a threat to biodiversity.            The  |ecological_footprint|Ecological_Footprint|  of Croatias population and industry varies significantly between the countrys regions since 50% of the population resides in 26.8% of the nations territory, with a particularly high impact made by the city of Zagreb and Zagreb County areas—their combined area comprises 6.6% of Croatias territory while encompassing 25% of the population.  The ecological footprint is most notably from the increased development of settlements and the sea coast leading to  |habitat_fragmentation|Habitat_Fragmentation| . Between 1998 and 2008, the greatest changes of  |land_use|Land_Use|  pertained to artificially developed areas, but the scale of development is negligible compared to EU member states.      The Croatian Environment Agency , a public institution established by the  |Government_of_Croatia|Government_Of_Croatia|  to collect and analyse information on the environment,  has identified further ecological problems as well as various degrees of progress in terms of curbing their environmental impact. These problems include inadequate legal  |landfills|Landfill|  as well as the presence of illegal landfills; between 2005 and 2008, 62 authorised and 423 illegal landfills were  |rehabilitated|Land_Rehabilitation| . In the same period, the number of issued  |waste_management|Waste_Management|  licences doubled, while the annual  |municipal_solid_waste|Municipal_Solid_Waste|  volume increased by 23%, reaching  per capita. The processes of  |soil_acidification|Soil_Acidification|  and  |organic_matter|Soil_Organic_Matter|  degradation are present throughout Croatia, with increasing  |soil_salinity|Soil_Salinity|  levels in the  |Neretva|Neretva|  river plain and spreading areas of  |alkali_soil|Alkali_Soil|  in  |Slavonia|Slavonia| .     Croatian  |air_pollution|Air_Pollution|  levels reflect the drop in industrial production recorded in 1991 at the onset of the  |Croatian_War_of_Independence|Croatian_War_Of_Independence| —pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of  |desulfurised|Hydrodesulfurization|  fuels has led to a 25% reduction of  |sulphur_dioxide|Sulphur_Dioxide|  emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in  |NO_x_|Nox|  emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of  |unleaded_petrol|Unleaded_Petrol|  reduced emissions of  |lead|Lead|  into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004.  |Air_quality|Air_Quality|  measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of  |greenhouse_gas|Greenhouse_Gas|  emissions in Croatia are  |energy_production|Energy_Production|  , industry and agriculture . The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the  |Kyoto_Protocol|Kyoto_Protocol|  limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of  |ozone_depleting_substances|Ozone_Depletion|  was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.     Even though Croatia has sufficient  |water_resources|Water_Resources|  at its disposal, these are not uniformly distributed and public  |water_supply_network|Water_Supply_Network|  losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface  |water_pollution|Water_Pollution|  increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time  |organic_waste|Organic_Waste|  pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new  |sewage_treatment|Sewage_Treatment|  plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatias  |groundwater|Groundwater| |aquifers|Aquifer|  are top  |quality|Water_Quality| , unlike the available surface water; the latters quality varies in terms of  |biochemical_oxygen_demand|Biochemical_Oxygen_Demand|  and  |bacteriological_water_analysis|Bacteriological_Water_Analysis|  results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public  |water_supply|Water_Supply|  system, but only 44% of the population have access to the public  |sewerage|Sewerage|  network, with  |septic_systems|Septic_System|  in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good,  |oligotroph|Oligotroph| ic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased  |eutrophication|Eutrophication|  were identified in the  |Bay_of_Bakar|Bay_Of_Bakar| , the Bay of  |Kaštela|Kaštela| , the Port of  |Šibenik|Šibenik|  and near  |Ploče|Ploče| ; other areas of localised pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of  |marine_pollution|Marine_Pollution|  , which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.          As of 2006, 46.8% of Croatia was occupied by  of forest and shrub, while a further  or 40.4% of the land was used for diverse agricultural uses including , or 7.8% of the total, for  |permanent_crops|Permanent_Crop| . Bush and grass cover was present on  or 8.4% of the territory, inland waters took up  or 1.0% and marshes covered  or 0.4% of the country. Artificial surfaces took up  or 3.1% of the countrys area. The greatest impetus for land use changes is the expansion of settlements and road construction.     Because of the  |Croatian_War_of_Independence|Croatian_War_Of_Independence| , there are numerous leftover  |minefields_in_Croatia|Minefields_In_Croatia| , largely tracing former front lines. As of 2006, suspected minefields covered . As of 2012, 62% of the remaining minefields are situated in forests, 26% of them are found in agricultural land, and 12% are found in other land; it is expected that  |mine_clearance|Demining|  will be complete by 2019.           Croatia is traditionally divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders are not always clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognisable ones throughout the country are  |Central_Croatia|Central_Croatia|  , Eastern Croatia , and  |Mountainous_Croatia|Mountainous_Croatia|  . These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the general area of the city of  |Zadar|Zadar|  and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the  |Croatian_Littoral|Croatian_Littoral|  and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.                  The  |demographic_features_of_the_Croatian_population|Demographics_Of_Croatia|  are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The  |Croatian_Bureau_of_Statistics|Croatian_Bureau_Of_Statistics|  has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29  million. The  |population_density|Population_Density|  was 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall  |life_expectancy_in_Croatia|List_Of_Countries_By_Life_Expectancy|  at birth is 75.7 years. The population rose steadily from 2.1  million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7  million. Since 1991, Croatias  |death_rate|Death_Rate|  has continuously exceeded its  |birth_rate|Birth_Rate| ; the natural growth rate of the population is thus currently negative.  Croatia is currently in the  |demographic_transitions|Demographic_Transition|  fourth or fifth stage.  In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment. The median age of the population is 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.      Croatia is inhabited mostly by  |Croats|Croats|  , while  |minorities|Ethnic_Minorities_In_Croatia|  include  |Serbs|Serbs|  and 21 other ethnicities recognised by the  |Constitution_of_Croatia|Constitution_Of_Croatia| .  The demographic history of Croatia is marked by significant migrations, including: the Croats arrival in the area;  the growth of the Hungarian and German speaking population after the  |personal_union_of_Croatia_and_Hungary|Croatia_In_Personal_Union_With_Hungary| ;  joining of the  |Habsburg_Empire|Habsburg_Monarchy| ;  migrations set off by the  |Ottoman_conquests|Growth_Of_The_Ottoman_Empire| ;    and the growth of the Italian-speaking population in  |Istria|Istriahistory|  and  |Dalmatia|History_Of_Dalmatia|  during the  |Venetian|Venetian_Republic|  rule there. After  |Austria_Hungarys_collapse|Austria_Hungarydissolution| , the Hungarian population declined,  while the German-speaking population was forced out or fled during the last part of and after World War II,  and a  |similar_fate|Istrian_Exodus|  was suffered by the Italian population.  The late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad.    The 1940s and the 1950s in  |Yugoslavia|Demographics_Of_Sfr_Yugoslavia|  were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by  |urbanisation|Urbanisation| . The most recent significant migrations came as a result of the  |Croatian_War_of_Independence|Croatian_War_Of_Independence|  when hundreds of thousands were displaced.        The  |Croatian_language|Croatian_Language|  is Croatias official language, but the languages of constitutionally-recognised minorities are officially used in some local government units.  Croatian is the native language identified by 96% of the population.  A 2009 survey revealed that 78% of Croatians claim knowledge of at least one foreign language—most often  |English|English_Language| .  The largest religions of Croatia are  |Roman_Catholicism|Roman_Catholic_Church|  ,  |Orthodox_Christianity|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  and  |Islam|Islam|  .  Literacy in Croatia stands at 98.1%. The proportion of the population aged 15 and over attaining  |academic_degrees|Academic_Degree|  has grown rapidly since 2001, doubling and reaching 16.7% by 2008.   An estimated 4.5% of GDP is spent for education. Primary and secondary education are available in Croatian and in the languages of recognised minorities. Croatia has a  |universal_health_care|Universal_Health_Care|  system and in 2010, the nation spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare.  The net monthly income in September 2011 averaged 5,397   |kuna|Croatian_Kuna|  .  The most significant sources of employment in 2008 were wholesale and retail trade, the manufacturing industry and construction. In October 2011, the unemployment rate was 17.4%.  Croatias median equivalent household income tops the average  |Purchasing_Power_Standard|Purchasing_Power_Standard|  of  |the_ten_countries_which_joined_the_EU_in_2004|2004_Enlargement_Of_The_European_Union| , while trailing the EU average.  The 2011 census recorded a total of 1.5  million private households; most owned their own housing.             Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the  |Middle_Ages|Kingdom_Of_Croatia_Establishment| .  The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, in addition to changes in the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria. The traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced  |oblasts|Oblast|  and  |banovinas|Subdivisions_Of_The_Kingdom_Of_Yugoslavia|  respectively.  Communist-ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-WWII Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced  |municipalities|Municipalities_Of_Croatia| , subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 by legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions—for instance, in 1918 the  |Transleithania|Transleithania| n part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar, Gospić, Ogulin, Požega, Vukovar, Varaždin, Osijek and Zagreb, while the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory. Međimurje County was established in the  |eponymous|Eponymous|  region acquired through the 1920  |Treaty_of_Trianon|Treaty_Of_Trianon| .        Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia has been divided into 20 counties and the capital city of  |Zagreb|Zagreb| , the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time .   The county borders have changed in some instances since , with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127  |cities|List_Of_Cities_In_Croatia|  and 429 municipalities.      The EU  |Nomenclature_of_Territorial_Units_for_Statistics|Nomenclature_Of_Territorial_Units_For_Statistics| |_division_of_Croatia|Nuts_Of_Croatia|  is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions; these are Central and Eastern Croatia, Northwest Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The last encompasses all counties along the Adriatic coast. Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb and Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci, Međimurje and Zagreb counties, and the Central and Eastern Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties.  Individual counties and the city of Zagreb represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS  |Local_administrative_unit|Local_Administrative_Unit|  divisions are two-tiered. The LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb—in effect making these the same as NUTS 3 units—while the LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia.                   The average urbanisation rate in Croatia stands at 56%, with a growing urban population and shrinking rural population. The largest city and the nations capital is Zagreb, with an urban population of 686,568 in the city itself. Zagrebs  |metropolitan_area|Metropolitan_Area|  encompasses 341 additional settlements and, by the year 2001, the population of the area had reached 978,161; approximately 60% of Zagreb Countys residents live in Zagrebs metropolitan area, as does about 41% of Croatias urban population.  The cities of Split and Rijeka are the largest settlements on the Croatian Adriatic coast, with each citys population being over 100,000. There are four other Croatian cities exceeding 50,000  people: Osijek, Zadar,  |Pula|Pula|  and Slavonski Brod; the Zagreb  |district|Zagrebcity_Districts|  of  |Sesvete|Sesvete| , which has the status of a  |standalone_settlement|Naselje|  but not a city, also has such a large population. A further eleven cities are populated by more than 20,000.
