Quality of service  is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a  |telephony|Telephony|  or  |computer_network|Computer_Network|  or a  |cloud_computing|Cloud_Computing|  service, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network. To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the network service are often considered, such as  |packet_loss|Packet_Loss| ,  |bit_rate|Bit_Rate| ,  |throughput|Throughput| ,  |transmission_delay|Transmission_Delay| ,  |availability|Availability| ,  |jitter|Jitter| , etc.     In the field of  |computer_networking|Computer_Networking|  and other  |packet-switched|Packet-Switched|  telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data  |flows|Flow| , or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.     Quality of service is particularly important for the transport of traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have introduced  |Voice_over_IP|Voice_Over_Ip|  technology to allow computer networks to become as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations, as well as supporting new applications with even stricter network performance requirements.       In the field of  |telephony|Telephony| , quality of service was defined by the  |ITU|Itu|  in 1994. Quality of service comprises requirements on all the aspects of a connection, such as service response time, loss, signal-to-noise ratio,  |crosstalk|Crosstalk| , echo, interrupts, frequency response, loudness levels, and so on. A subset of telephony QoS is  |grade_of_service|Grade_Of_Service|  requirements, which comprises aspects of a connection relating to capacity and coverage of a network, for example guaranteed maximum  |blocking_probability|Blocking_Probability|  and outage probability.   ITU-T Study Group 2      In the field of  |computer_networking|Computer_Networking|  and other  |packet-switched|Packet-Switched|  telecommunication networks,  |teletraffic_engineering|Teletraffic_Engineering|  refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or  |data_flows|Flow| , or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. For example, a required bit rate,  |delay|Network_Delay| ,  |delay_variation|Packet_Delay_Variation| ,  |packet_loss|Packet_Loss|  or  |bit_error_rates|Bit_Error_Rate|  may be guaranteed. Quality of service is important for real-time  |streaming_multimedia|Streaming_Multimedia|  applications such as  |voice_over_IP|Voice_Over_Ip| ,  |multiplayer_online_games|Multiplayer_Online_Game|  and  |IPTV|Iptv| , since these often require fixed bit rate and are delay sensitive. Quality of service is especially important in networks where the capacity is a limited resource, for example in cellular data communication.     A network or protocol that supports QoS may agree on a  |traffic_contract|Traffic_Contract|  with the application software and reserve capacity in the network nodes, for example during a session establishment phase. During the session it may monitor the achieved level of performance, for example the data rate and delay, and dynamically control scheduling priorities in the network nodes. It may release the reserved capacity during a  |tear_down|Clearing|  phase.     A  |best-effort|Best-Effort|  network or service does not support quality of service. An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication over a best-effort network by  |over-provisioning|Overprovisioning|  the capacity so that it is sufficient for the expected peak traffic load. The resulting absence of  |network_congestion|Network_Congestion|  reduces or eliminates the need for QoS mechanisms.     QoS is sometimes used as a quality measure, with many alternative definitions, rather than referring to the ability to reserve resources. Quality of service sometimes refers to the level of quality of service, i.e. the guaranteed service quality.  High QoS is often confused with a high level of performance, for example high bit rate, low  |latency|Latency|  and low bit error rate.     QoS is sometimes used in application layer services such as telephony and  |streaming_video|Streaming_Video|  to describe a metric that reflects or predicts the subjectively experienced quality. In this context, QoS is the acceptable cumulative effect on subscriber satisfaction of all imperfections affecting the service. Other terms with similar meaning are the  |quality_of_experience|Quality_Of_Experience|  ,  |mean_opinion_score|Mean_Opinion_Score|  ,  |perceptual_speech_quality_measure|Perceptual_Speech_Quality_Measure|  and  |perceptual_evaluation_of_video_quality|Perceptual_Evaluation_Of_Video_Quality|  . See also  |Subjective_video_quality|Subjective_Video_Quality| .          A number of attempts for  |layer_2|Layer_2|  technologies that add QoS tags to the data have gained popularity in the past. Examples are  |frame_relay|Frame_Relay| ,  |asynchronous_transfer_mode|Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode|  and  |multiprotocol_label_switching|Multiprotocol_Label_Switching|  . Despite these network technologies remaining in use today, this kind of network lost attention after the advent of  |Ethernet|Ethernet|  networks. Today Ethernet is, by far, the most popular layer 2 technology. Conventional  |Internet_routers|Internet_Router|  and  |LAN_switch|Lan_Switch| es operate on a  |best_effort|Best_Effort|  basis. This equipment is less expensive, less complex and faster and thus more popular than earlier more complex technologies that provide QoS mechanisms.     Ethernet optionally uses  |802.1p|802.1P|  to signal the priority of a frame.     There were four  type of service  bits and three precedence bits originally provided in each  |IP_packet_header|Ipv4_Header| , but they were not generally respected. These bits were later re-defined as  |Differentiated_services_code_points|Differentiated_Services_Code_Point|  .     With the advent of  |IPTV|Iptv|  and  |IP_telephony|Ip_Telephony| , QoS mechanisms are increasingly available to the end user.       In  |packet-switched_networks|Packet-Switched_Network| , quality of service is affected by various factors, which can be divided into human and technical factors. Human factors include: stability of service quality, availability of service, waiting times and user information. Technical factors include: reliability, scalability, effectiveness, maintainability and network congestion.      Many things can happen to packets as they travel from origin to destination, resulting in the following problems as seen from the point of view of the sender and receiver:     ;  |Goodput|Goodput| |Packet_loss|Packet_Loss|  some packets due to network congestion. The receiving application may ask for this information to be retransmitted, possibly resulting in  |congestive_collapse|Congestive_Collapse|  or unacceptable delays in the overall transmission.   ; Errors: Sometimes packets are corrupted due to  |bit_errors|Bit_Error|  caused by noise and interference, especially in wireless communications and long copper wires. The receiver has to detect this and, just as if the packet was dropped, may ask for this information to be retransmitted.   ;  |Latency|Network_Delay| |Packet_delay_variation|Packet_Delay_Variation| |Out-of-order_delivery|Out-Of-Order_Delivery| |Streaming_media|Streaming_Media|  specifically    |Internet_protocol_television|Internet_Protocol_Television| |Audio_over_Ethernet|Audio_Over_Ethernet| |Audio_over_IP|Audio_Over_Ip| |Voice_over_IP|Voice_Over_Ip| |Videotelephony|Videotelephony| |Telepresence|Telepresence| |iSCSI|Iscsi|  and  |Fibre_Channel_over_Ethernet|Fibre_Channel_Over_Ethernet| |Circuit_emulation_service|Circuit_Emulation_Service| |Safety-critical|Safety-Critical_System|  applications such as  |remote_surgery|Remote_Surgery|  where  |availability|Availability|  issues can be hazardous   Network  |operations_support_systems|Operations_Support_System|  either for the network itself, or for customers business critical needs    |Online_games|Online_Game|  where real-time  |lag|Lag|  can be a factor    |Industrial_control_systems|Industrial_Control_System|  protocols such as  |EtherNet/IP|Ethernet/Ip|  which are used for real-time control of machinery     These types of service are called inelastic, meaning that they require a certain minimum bit rate and a certain maximum latency to function. By contrast, elastic applications can take advantage of however much or little  |bandwidth|Bandwidth|  is available. Bulk file transfer applications that rely on  |TCP|Transmission_Control_Protocol|  are generally elastic.       Circuit switched networks, especially those intended for voice transmission, such as  |Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode|Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode|  or  |GSM|Gsm| , have QoS in the core protocol, resources are reserved at each step on the network for the call as it is set up, there is no need for additional procedures to achieve required performance. Shorter data units and built-in QoS were some of the  |unique_selling_points|Unique_Selling_Point|  of ATM for applications such as  |video_on_demand|Video_On_Demand| .     When the expense of mechanisms to provide QoS is justified, network customers and providers can enter into a contractual agreement termed a  |service-level_agreement|Service-Level_Agreement|  which specifies guarantees for the ability of a connection to give guaranteed performance in terms of throughput or latency based on mutually agreed measures.       An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication by generously over-provisioning a network so that capacity is based on peak traffic load estimates. This approach is simple for networks with predictable peak loads. This calculation may need to appreciate demanding applications that can compensate for variations in bandwidth and delay with large receive buffers, which is often possible for example in video streaming.     Over-provisioning can be of limited use in the face of transport protocols  that over time increase the amount of data placed on the network until all available bandwidth is consumed and packets are dropped. Such greedy protocols tend to increase latency and packet loss for all users.     The amount of over-provisioning in interior links required to replace QoS depends on the number of users and their traffic demands. This limits usability of over-provisioning. Newer more bandwidth intensive applications and the addition of more users results in the loss of over-provisioned networks. This then requires a physical update of the relevant network links which is an expensive process. Thus over-provisioning cannot be blindly assumed on the Internet.     Commercial VoIP services are often competitive with traditional telephone service in terms of call quality even without QoS mechanisms in use on the users connection to their ISP and the VoIP providers connection to a different ISP. Under high load conditions, however, VoIP may degrade to cell-phone quality or worse. The mathematics of packet traffic indicate that network requires just 60% more raw capacity under conservative assumptions.        Unlike single-owner networks, the  |Internet|Internet|  is a series of exchange points interconnecting private networks.  Hence the Internets core is owned and managed by a number of different  |network_service_providers|Network_Service_Provider| , not a single entity. Its behavior is much more  |unpredictable|Predictability| .     There are two principal approaches to QoS in modern packet-switched IP networks, a parameterized system based on an exchange of application requirements with the network, and a prioritized system where each packet identifies a desired service level to the network.    |Integrated_services|Integrated_Services|  implements the parameterized approach. In this model, applications use the  |Resource_Reservation_Protocol|Resource_Reservation_Protocol|  to request and reserve resources through a network.    |Differentiated_services|Differentiated_Services|  implements the prioritized model. DiffServ marks packets according to the type of service they desire. In response to these markings, routers and switches use various  |scheduling|Network_Scheduler|  strategies to tailor performance to expectations. Differentiated services code point markings use the first 6 bits in the  |ToS|Type_Of_Service|  field of the  |IP_packet_header|Ipv4_Header| .     Early work used the integrated services philosophy of reserving network resources. In this model, applications used RSVP to request and reserve resources through a network. While IntServ mechanisms do work, it was realized that in a broadband network typical of a larger service provider, Core routers would be required to accept, maintain, and tear down thousands or possibly tens of thousands of reservations. It was believed that this approach would not scale with the growth of the Internet,  and in any event was antithetical to the  |end-to-end_principle|End-To-End_Principle| , the notion of designing networks so that core routers do little more than simply switch packets at the highest possible rates.     Under DiffServ, packets are marked either by the traffic sources themselves or by the  |edge_devices|Edge_Device|  where the traffic enters the network. In response to these markings, routers and switches use various queuing strategies to tailor performance to requirements. At the IP layer, DSCP markings use the 6 bit DS field in the IP packet header. At the MAC layer,  |VLAN|Vlan| |IEEE_802.1Q|Ieee_802.1Q|  can be used to carry 3 bit of essentially the same information. Routers and switches supporting DiffServ configure their network scheduler to use multiple queues for packets awaiting transmission from bandwidth constrained interfaces. Router vendors provide different capabilities for configuring this behavior, to include the number of queues supported, the relative priorities of queues, and bandwidth reserved for each queue.      In practice, when a packet must be forwarded from an interface with queuing, packets requiring low jitter  are given priority over packets in other queues. Typically, some bandwidth is allocated by default to network control packets , while best effort traffic might simply be given whatever bandwidth is left over.     At the  |Media_Access_Control|Media_Access_Control|  layer,  |VLAN|Vlan| |IEEE_802.1Q|Ieee_802.1Q|  and  |IEEE_802.1p|Ieee_802.1P|  can be used to distinguish between Ethernet frames and classify them. Queueing theory models have been developed on performance analysis and QoS for MAC layer protocols.        |Cisco_IOS|Cisco_Ios|  NetFlow and the Cisco Class Based QoS Management Information Base are marketed by  |Cisco_Systems|Cisco_Systems| .        One compelling example of the need for QoS on the Internet relates to congestive collapse. The Internet relies on congestion avoidance protocols, as built into  |Transmission_Control_Protocol|Transmission_Control_Protocol|  , to reduce traffic under conditions that would otherwise lead to meltdown . QoS applications, such as  |VoIP|Voip|  and  |IPTV|Iptv| , require largely constant bitrates and low latency, therefore they cannot use TCP and cannot otherwise reduce their traffic rate to help prevent congestion. QoS contracts limit traffic that can be offered to the Internet and thereby enforce traffic shaping that can prevent it from becoming overloaded, and are hence an indispensable part of the Internets ability to handle a mix of real-time and non-real-time traffic without meltdown.       The  |type_of_service|Type_Of_Service|  field in the  |IP_header|Ipv4_Header| |Differentiated_services|Differentiated_Services| |Integrated_services|Integrated_Services| |Resource_Reservation_Protocol|Resource_Reservation_Protocol| |Multiprotocol_Label_Switching|Multiprotocol_Label_Switching|  provides eight QoS classes     |RSVP-TE|Rsvp-Te| |Frame_relay|Frame_Relay| |X.25|X.25| |ADSL|Adsl|  modems    |Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode|Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode| |IEEE_802.1Q|Ieee_802.1Q|  with  |Audio_Video_Bridging|Audio_Video_Bridging|  and  |Time-Sensitive_Networking|Time-Sensitive_Networking| |IEEE_802.11e|Ieee_802.11E| |HomePNA|Homepna|  Home networking over coax and phone wires   The  |ITU-T|Itu-T| |G.hn|G.Hn|  standard provides QoS by means of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities which are allocated to flows which require QoS and which have negotiated a contract with the network controller. G.hn also supports non-QoS operation by means of Contention-based Time Slots .       End-to-end quality of service can require a method of coordinating resource allocation between one  |autonomous_system|Autonomous_System|  and another.   The  |Internet_Engineering_Task_Force|Internet_Engineering_Task_Force|  defined the  |Resource_Reservation_Protocol|Resource_Reservation_Protocol|  for bandwidth reservation, as a proposed standard in 1997.    RSVP is an  |end-to-end|End-To-End_Principle|  bandwidth reservation protocol. The traffic engineering version,  |RSVP-TE|Rsvp-Te| , is used in many networks to establish traffic-engineered  |Multiprotocol_Label_Switching|Multiprotocol_Label_Switching|  label-switched paths.   The IETF also defined  |Next_Steps_in_Signaling|Next_Steps_In_Signaling|   with QoS signalling as a target. NSIS is a development and simplification of RSVP.     Research consortia such as end-to-end quality of service support over heterogeneous networks  and fora such as the  |IPsphere_Forum|Ipsphere_Forum|    developed more mechanisms for handshaking QoS invocation from one domain to the next. IPsphere defined the  |Service_Structuring_Stratum|Service_Structuring_Stratum|  signaling bus in order to establish, invoke and assure network services.   EuQoS conducted experiments to integrate  |Session_Initiation_Protocol|Session_Initiation_Protocol| ,  |Next_Steps_in_Signaling|Next_Steps_In_Signaling|  and IPspheres SSS with an estimated cost of about 15.6 million Euro and published a book.       A research project Multi Service Access Everywhere defined another QoS concept in a first phase from January 2004 through February 2006, and a second phase from January 2006 through 2007.      Another research project named PlaNetS was proposed for European funding circa 2005.    A broader European project called Architecture and design for the future Internet known as 4WARD had a budget estimated at 23.4 million Euro and was funded from January 2008 through June 2010.    It included a Quality of Service Theme and published a book.     Another European project, called WIDENS  proposed a bandwidth reservation approach for mobile wireless multirate adhoc networks.         |Strong_cryptography|Strong_Cryptography|  network protocols such as  |Secure_Sockets_Layer|Transport_Layer_Security| ,  |I2P|I2P| , and  |virtual_private_networks|Virtual_Private_Network|  obscure the data transferred using them. As all  |electronic_commerce|Electronic_Commerce|  on the Internet requires the use of such strong cryptography protocols, unilaterally downgrading the performance of encrypted traffic creates an unacceptable hazard for customers. Yet, encrypted traffic is otherwise unable to undergo  |deep_packet_inspection|Deep_Packet_Inspection|  for QoS.     Protocols like  |ICA|Independent_Computing_Architecture|  and  |RDP|Remote_Desktop_Protocol|  may encapsulate other traffic with varying requirements that can make optimization difficult.       The  |Internet2|Internet2|  project found, in 2001, that the QoS protocols were probably not deployable inside its  |Abilene_Network|Abilene_Network|  with equipment available at that time.    Equipment available at the time relied on software to implement QoS. The group also predicted that “logistical, financial, and organizational barriers will block the way toward any bandwidth guarantees” by protocol modifications aimed at QoS.    They believed that the economics would encourage network providers to deliberately erode the quality of best effort traffic as a way to push customers to higher priced QoS services. Instead they proposed over-provisioning of capacity as more cost-effective at the time.     The Abilene network study was the basis for the testimony of Gary Bachula to the  |US_Senate_Commerce_Committees|United_States_Senate_Committee_On_Commerce,_Science_And_Transportation|  hearing on  |Network_Neutrality|Network_Neutrality|  in early 2006. He expressed the opinion that adding more bandwidth was more effective than any of the various schemes for accomplishing QoS they examined.      Bachulas testimony has been cited by proponents of a law banning quality of service as proof that no legitimate purpose is served by such an offering. This argument is dependent on the assumption that over-provisioning isnt a form of QoS and that it is always possible. Cost and other factors affect the ability of carriers to build and maintain permanently over-provisioned networks.          Mobile cellular service providers may offer  |mobile_QoS|Mobile_Qos|  to customers just as the fixed line  |PSTN|Pstn|  services providers and Internet Service Providers may offer QoS. QoS mechanisms are always provided for  |circuit_switched|Circuit_Switched|  services, and are essential for non-elastic services, for example  |streaming_multimedia|Streaming_Multimedia| .     Mobility adds complication to the QoS mechanisms, for several reasons:   A phone call or other session may be interrupted after a  |handover|Handover| , if the new  |base_station|Base_Station|  is overloaded. Unpredictable handovers make it impossible to give an absolute QoS guarantee during a session initiation phase.   The pricing structure is often based on per-minute or per-megabyte fee rather than  |flat_rate|Flat_Rate| , and may be different for different content services.   A crucial part of QoS in mobile communications is  |grade_of_service|Grade_Of_Service| , involving outage probability ,  |blocking_probability|Blocking_Probability|  and  |scheduling_starvation|Scheduling_Starvation| . These performance measures are affected by mechanisms such as  |mobility_management|Mobility_Management| ,  |radio_resource_management|Radio_Resource_Management| ,  |admission_control|Admission_Control| ,  |fair_scheduling|Fair_Scheduling| ,  |channel-dependent_scheduling|Channel-Dependent_Scheduling|  etc.       Quality of service in the field of  |telephony|Telephony| , was first defined in 1994 in the  |ITU-T|Itu-T|  Recommendation E.800. This definition is very broad, listing 6 primary components: Support, Operability, Accessibility, Retainability, Integrity and Security.  Updated September 2008 as Definitions of terms related to quality of service   A 1995 recommendation X.902 included a definition is the  |OSI_reference_model|Osi_Reference_Model| .  Updated October 2009.   In 1998 the ITU published a document discussing QoS in the field of data networking. X.641 offers a means of developing or enhancing standards related to QoS and provide concepts and terminology that will assist in maintaining the consistency of related standards.      Some QoS-related IETF  |Request_For_Commentss|Request_For_Comments|  are , and ; both these are discussed above. The IETF has also published two RFCs giving background on QoS: , and .     The IETF has also published  as an informative or best practices document about the practical aspects of designing a QoS solution for a  |DiffServ|Diffserv|  network. They try to identify which types of applications are commonly run over an IP network to group them into traffic classes, study what treatment do each of these classes need from the network, and suggest which of the QoS mechanisms commonly available in routers can be used to implement those treatments.        |Linux|Linux|  Advanced Routing & Traffic Control    Linux Bandwidth Arbitrator    Zero Shell     |modqos|Modqos|  adding QoS to the  |Apache|Apache_Http_Server|.
