Except for the Gigante cultivar, spring-grown kohlrabi much over 5  cm in size tend to be woody, as do full-grown kohlrabi much over perhaps 10  cm in size; the Gigante cultivar can achieve great size while remaining of good eating quality.  The plant matures in 55–60 days after sowing and has good standing ability for up to 30 days after maturity. The approximate weight is 150 g.           There are several varieties commonly available, including White Vienna,  Purple Vienna, Grand Duke, Gigante , Purple Danube, and White Danube. Coloration of the purple types is superficial: the edible parts are all pale yellow. The leafy greens can also be eaten. One commonly used variety grows without a swollen stem, having just leaves and a very thin stem, and is called Haakh. Haakh and Monj are popular Kashmiri dishes made using this vegetable. In the second year, the plant will bloom and develop seeds. Kohlrabi also comes in three different colors: white, purple, and pale green.       Kohlrabi stems are surrounded by two distinct fibrous layers that do not soften appreciably when cooked. These layers are generally peeled away prior to cooking or serving raw, with the result that the stems often provide a smaller amount of food than one might assume from their intact appearance.     The bulbous kohlrabi stem is frequently used raw in salad or slaws. It has a texture similar to that of a broccoli stem, but with a flavor that is sweeter and less vegetal.     Kohlrabi leaves are edible and can be used interchangeably with ": null
