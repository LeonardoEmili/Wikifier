        Afonso VI , known as the Victorious , was the second  |King_of_Portugal|King_Of_Portugal|  of the  |House_of_Braganza|House_Of_Braganza|  from 1656 until his death. He was initially under the regency of his mother,  |Luisa_of_Medina-Sidonia|Luisa_Of_Medina-Sidonia| , until 1662, when he removed her to a convent and took power with the help of his favourite, the  |Count_of_Castelo_Melhor|Luís_De_Vasconcelos_E_Sousa,_3Rd_Count_Of_Castelo_Melhor| .     Afonsos reign saw the end of the  |Restoration_War|Portuguese_Restoration_War|  and Spains recognition of Portugals independence. He also negotiated a French alliance through his marriage. However, the king was physically and mentally weak. In 1668, his brother  |Pedro|Peter_Ii_Of_Portugal|  conspired to have him declared incapable of ruling, and took supreme de facto power as regent, although nominally Afonso was still sovereign. Queen  |Marie_Françoise|Maria_Francisca_Of_Savoy| , Afonsos wife, received an annulment and subsequently married Pedro. Afonso spent the rest of his life and reign practically a prisoner.       At the age of three, Afonso suffered an illness that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body, also leaving him mentally unstable. His father created him 10th  |Duke_of_Braganza|Duke_Of_Braganza| .     After the death of his eldest brother  |Teodósio,_Prince_of_Brazil|Teodósio,_Prince_Of_Brazil|  in 1653, Afonso became the  |heir_apparent|Heir_Apparent|  to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd  |Prince_of_Brazil|Prince_Of_Brazil| .          He succeeded his father  in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother,  |Luisa_of_Medina-Sidonia|Luisa_Of_Medina-Sidonia| , was named regent in his fathers will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his lack of interest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662. Afonso oversaw decisive military victories over the Spanish at  |Elvas|Battle_Of_The_Lines_Of_Elvas|  ,  |Ameixial|Battle_Of_Ameixial|  and  |Montes_Claros|Battle_Of_Montes_Claros|  , culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugals new ruling dynasty, the  |House_of_Braganza|House_Of_Braganza| , on 13 February 1668 in the  |Treaty_of_Lisbon|Treaty_Of_Lisbon| .       Colonial affairs saw the  |Dutch|Netherlands|  conquest of  |Jaffna|Jaffna| patam, Portugals last colony in  |Portuguese_Ceylon|Portuguese_Ceylon|  and the cession of  |Bombay|Bombay|  and  |Tangier|Tangier|  to England as dowry for Afonsos sister,  |Catherine_of_Braganza|Catherine_Of_Braganza| , who had married King  |Charles_II_of_England|Charles_Ii_Of_England| . English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of  |Brazil|Colonial_Brazil|  in return for uncontested control of  |Ceylon|Ceylon| .     In 1662, the  |Count_of_Castelo_Melhor|Luís_De_Vasconcelos_E_Sousa,_3Rd_Count_Of_Castelo_Melhor|  saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile her in Portugal. As a result, Afonso sent his mother to a convent.       Afonso married  |Marie_Françoise_of_Nemours|Marie_Françoise_Of_Nemours| , the daughter of the  |Duke_of_Savoy|Duke_Of_Savoy|  in 1666, but the marriage was short-lived. Marie Françoise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonsos brother, Pedro,  |Duke_of_Beja|Duke_Of_Beja|  .          That same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force Afonso to relinquish control of the government to him, and he became Prince Regent in 1668. While Pedro never formally usurped the throne, Afonso was king in name only for the rest of his life.  For seven years after Pedros coup, Afonso was kept on the island of  |Terceira|Terceira|  in the  |Azores|Azores| . His health broken by this captivity, he was eventually permitted to return to the Portuguese mainland, but he remained powerless and kept under guard. At  |Sintra|Sintra|  he died in 1683.      The room where he was imprisoned is preserved at  |Sintra_National_Palace|Sintra_National_Palace| .
