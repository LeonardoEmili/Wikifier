            Bavaria , officially the Free State of Bavaria , is a landlocked  |federal_state|States_Of_Germany|  of  |Germany|Federal_Republic_Of_Germany| , occupying its southeastern corner. With an area of 70,550.19 square kilometres , Bavaria is the largest German state by land area comprising roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany. With 13  million inhabitants, it is Germanys second-most-populous state after  |North_Rhine_Westphalia|North_Rhine_Westphalia| . Bavarias main cities are  |Munich|Munich|  ,  |Nuremberg|Nuremberg|  and  |Augsburg|Augsburg| .     The  |history_of_Bavaria|History_Of_Bavaria|  includes its earliest settlement by  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age| |_Celtic|Celts|  tribes, followed by the conquests of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  in the 1st century BC, when the territory was incorporated into the provinces of  |Raetia|Raetia|  and  |Noricum|Noricum| . It became a  |stem_duchy|Stem_Duchy|  in the 6th century AD following the collapse of the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire| . It was later incorporated into the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , became an independent kingdom, joined the Prussian-led  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  in 1871 while retaining its title of kingdom, and finally became a  |state|States_Of_Germany|  of the  |Federal_Republic_of_Germany|Federal_Republic_Of_Germany|  in 1949.      The  |Duchy_of_Bavaria|Duchy_Of_Bavaria|  dates back to the year 555. In the 17th century AD, the  |Duke_of_Bavaria|Duke_Of_Bavaria|  became a  |Prince_elector|Prince_Elector|  of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . The  |Kingdom_of_Bavaria|Kingdom_Of_Bavaria|  existed from 1806 to 1918, when Bavaria became a republic. In 1946, the Free State of Bavaria reorganized itself on democratic lines after the Second World War.     Bavaria has a unique culture, largely because of the states former  |Catholic|Catholic_Church|  majority and conservative traditions.   |Bavarians|Bavarian_People|  have traditionally been proud of their culture, which includes a  |language|Bavarian_Language| ,  |cuisine|Bavarian_Cuisine| , architecture, festivals such as  |Oktoberfest|Oktoberfest|  and elements of  |Alpine|The_Alps|  symbolism.  The state also has the second largest economy among the  |German_states_by_GDP_figures|List_Of_German_States_By_Gdp| , giving it a status as a rather wealthy German region.      Modern Bavaria also includes parts of the historical regions of  |Franconia|Franconia|  and  |Swabia|Swabia| .              The Bavarians emerged in a region north of the  |Alps|Alps| , previously inhabited by  |Celts|Celts| , which had been part of the Roman provinces of  |Raetia|Raetia|  and  |Noricum|Noricum| . The Bavarians spoke  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German| , but, unlike other Germanic groups, they probably did not migrate from elsewhere. Rather, they seem to have coalesced out of other groups left behind by the Roman withdrawal late in the 5th century. These peoples may have included the Celtic  |Boii|Boii| , some remaining  |Romans|Ancient_Rome| ,  |Marcomanni|Marcomanni| ,  |Allemanni|Allemanni| ,  |Quadi|Quadi| ,  |Thuringians|Thuringians| ,  |Goths|Goths| ,  |Scirians|Scirians| ,  |Rugians|Rugians| ,  |Heruli|Heruli| . The name Bavarian  means Men of Baia which may indicate Bohemia, the homeland of the Celtic  |Boii|Boii|  and later of the Marcomanni. They first appear in written sources circa 520. A 17th century Jewish chronicler  |David_Solomon_Ganz|David_Gans| , citing  |Cyriacus_Spangenberg|Cyriacus_Spangenberg| , claimed that the diocese was named after an ancient Bohemian king, Boiia, in the 14th century BC. Dovid Solomon Ganz, Tzemach Dovid , part 2, Warsaw 1878, pp. 71, 85           From about 554 to 788, the house of  |Agilolfing|Agilolfing|  ruled the  |Duchy_of_Bavaria|Duchy_Of_Bavaria| , ending with  |Tassilo_III|Tassilo_Iii|  who was deposed by  |Charlemagne|Charlemagne| .      Three early dukes are named in  |Frankish|Franks|  sources:  |Garibald_I|Garibald_I|  may have been appointed to the office by the  |Merovingian|Merovingian|  kings and married the  |Lombard|Lombardy|  princess Walderada when the church forbade her to King  |Chlothar_I|Chlothar_I|  in 555. Their daughter,  |Theodelinde|Theodelinde| , became Queen of the Lombards in northern Italy and Garibald was forced to flee to her when he fell out with his Frankish overlords. Garibalds successor,  |Tassilo_I|Tassilo_I_Of_Bavaria| , tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of  |Slavs|Slavic_Peoples|  and  |Avars|Pannonian_Avars|  around 600. Tassilos son  |Garibald_II|Garibald_Ii_Of_Bavaria|  seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616.      After Garibald II little is known of the Bavarians until  |Duke_Theodo_I|Theodo_Of_Bavariaordinals| , whose reign may have begun as early as 680. From 696 onward, he invited churchmen from the west to organize churches and strengthen Christianity in his duchy. His son,  |Theudebert|Theodbert_Of_Bavaria| , led a decisive Bavarian campaign to intervene in a succession dispute in the  |Lombard_Kingdom|Lombards|  in 714, and married his sister Guntrud to the Lombard  |King_Liutprand|Liutprand_King_Of_The_Lombards| . At Theodos death the duchy was divided among his sons, but reunited under his grandson  |Hugbert|Hugbert_Of_Bavaria| .           At Hugberts death the duchy passed to a distant relative named  |Odilo|Odilo_Of_Bavaria| , from neighboring  |Alemannia|Alemannia|  . Odilo issued a  |law_code_for_Bavaria|Lex_Baiuvariorum| , completed the process of church organization in partnership with  |St_Boniface|Saint_Boniface|  , and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the  |Carolingian|Carolingian_Dynasty| |_Grifo|Grifo| . He was defeated near  |Augsburg|Augsburg|  in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748.    |Saint_Boniface|Saint_Boniface|  completed the peoples conversion to Christianity in the early 8th century.      |Tassilo_III|Tassilo_Iii_Of_Bavaria|  succeeded his father at the age of eight after an unsuccessful attempt by Grifo to rule Bavaria. He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onward. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the  |River_Danube|River_Danube|  and colonizing these lands. After 781, however, his cousin Charlemagne began to pressure Tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. The deposition was not entirely legitimate. Dissenters attempted a coup against Charlemagne at Tassilos old capital of  |Regensburg|Regensburg|  in 792, led by his own son  |PÃ©pin_the_Hunchback|Pepin_The_Hunchback| . The king had to drag Tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the Assembly of Frankfurt in 794. This is the last appearance of Tassilo in the sources, and he probably died a monk. As all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the Agilolfing dynasty.        For the next 400 years numerous families held the duchy, rarely for more than three generations. With the revolt of duke  |Henry_the_Quarrelsome|Henry_Ii_Duke_Of_Bavaria|  in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and south east. The territory of  Ostarrichi  was elevated to a duchy in its own right and given to the  |Babenberger_family|House_Of_Babenberg| . This event marks the founding of  |Austria|Austria| .     The last, and one of the most important, of the dukes of Bavaria was  |Henry_the_Lion|Henry_The_Lion|  of the  |house_of_Welf|House_Of_Welf| , founder of Munich, and de facto the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of  |Saxony|Saxony|  and Bavaria by his cousin,  |Frederick_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Frederick_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  , Bavaria was awarded as  |fief|Fief|  to the  |Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach|  family, counts palatinate of Schyren . They ruled for 738 years, from 1180 to 1918. The  |Electorate_of_the_Palatinate|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate|  by Rhine  was also acquired by the  |House_of_Wittelsbach|House_Of_Wittelsbach|  in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries.      The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the  |Hohenstaufen|House_Of_Hohenstaufen|  in 1268,  |Swabia|Swabia| n territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes.  |Emperor_Louis_the_Bavarian|Louis_Iv_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  acquired  |Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg| ,  |Tyrol|County_Of_Tyrol| ,  |Holland|County_Of_Holland|  and  |Hainaut|County_Of_Hainaut|  for his House but released the  |Upper_Palatinate|Upper_Palatinate|  for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies existed after the division of 1392:  |Bavaria_Straubing|Bavaria_Straubing| ,  |Bavaria_Landshut|Bavaria_Landshut| ,  |Bavaria_Ingolstadt|Bavaria_Ingolstadt|  and  |Bavaria_Munich|Bavaria_Munich| . In 1506 with the  |Landshut_War_of_Succession|Landshut_War_Of_Succession| , the other parts of Bavaria were reunited, and Munich became the sole capital. The country became one of the Jesuit-supported counter-reformation centers.               In 1623 the Bavarian duke replaced his relative of the Palatinate branch, the  |Electorate_of_the_Palatinate|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate|  in the early days of the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War|  and acquired the powerful  |prince_elector|Prince_Elector| al dignity in the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empires laws.     During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria . From 1777 onward, and after the younger Bavarian branch of the family had died out with elector  |Max_III_Joseph|Maximilian_Iii_Joseph_Elector_Of_Bavaria| , Bavaria and the  |Electorate_of_the_Palatinate|Electorate_Of_The_Palatinate|  were governed once again in  |personal_union|Personal_Union| , now by the Palatinian lines. The new state also comprised the  |Duchies_of_JÃ¼lich|Duchy_Of_JÃ¼lich|  and  |Berg|Berg|  as these on their part were in personal union with the Palatinate.             When  |Napoleon|Napoleon|  abolished the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria became a  |kingdom|Kingdom_Of_Bavaria|  in 1806 due, in part, to the  |Confederation_of_the_Rhine|Confederation_Of_The_Rhine| .  Its area doubled after the Duchy of JÃ¼lich was ceded to France, as the Electoral Palatinate was divided between France and the  |Grand_Duchy_of_Baden|Grand_Duchy_Of_Baden| . The Duchy of Berg was given to  |Jerome_Bonaparte|Jerome_Bonaparte| .  |Tyrol|County_Of_Tyrol|  and  |Salzburg|Salzburg|  were temporarily reunited with Bavaria but finally ceded to Austria by the  |Congress_of_Vienna|Congress_Of_Vienna| . In return Bavaria was allowed to annex the modern-day region of  |Palatinate|Palatinate|  to the west of the  |Rhine|Rhine|  and  |Franconia|Franconia|  in 1815. Between 1799 and 1817, the leading minister, Count  |Montgelas|Maximilian_Joseph_Von_Montgelas| , followed a strict policy of modernisation; he laid the foundations of administrative structures that survived the monarchy and retain core validity in the 21st century. In May 1808 a first constitution was passed by  |Maximilian_I|Maximilian_I_Joseph_Of_Bavaria| ,  being modernized in 1818. This second version established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords  and a House of Commons . That constitution was followed until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .     After the rise of  |Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  to power in the early 18th century, Bavaria preserved its independence by playing off the rivalry of Prussia and  |Austria|Austrian_Empire| . Allied to Austria, it was defeated along with Austria in the 1866  |Austro_Prussian_War|Austro_Prussian_War|  and was not incorporated into the  |North_German_Confederation|North_German_Federation|  of 1867, but the question of German unity was still alive. When  |France_declared_war_on_Prussia_in_1870|Franco_Prussian_War| , the south German states Baden, WÃ¼rttemberg, Hessen-Darmstadt and Bavaria joined the Prussian forces and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed  |Deutsches_Reich_|German_Empire|  in 1871 while Austria did not. Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and it had some special rights within the federation .          When Bavaria became part of the newly formed German Empire, this action was considered controversial by  |Bavarian_nationalists|Bavarian_Nationalism|  who had wanted to retain independence from the rest of Germany, as Austria had. As Bavaria had a majority-Catholic population, many people resented being ruled by the mostly  |Protestant|Protestant|  northerners of  |Prussia|Prussia| . As a direct result of the Bavarian-Prussian feud, political parties formed to encourage Bavaria to break away and regain its independence.  Although the idea of Bavarian separatism was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, apart from a small minority such as the  |Bavaria_Party|Bavaria_Party| , most Bavarians accepted that Bavaria is part of Germany.      In the early 20th century,  |Wassily_Kandinsky|Wassily_Kandinsky| ,  |Paul_Klee|Paul_Klee| ,  |Henrik_Ibsen|Henrik_Ibsen| , and other artists were drawn to Bavaria, especially to the  |Schwabing|Schwabing|  district of Munich, a center of international artistic activity. This area was devastated by bombing and invasion during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| .             Free State has been an adopted designation after the abolition of monarchy in the aftermath of World War I in several German states.   On 12 November 1918,  |Ludwig_III|Ludwig_Iii_Of_Bavaria|  signed a document, the  |Anif_declaration|Anif_Declaration| , releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths; the  |newly_formed_republican_government|Peoples_State_Of_Bavaria| , or Peoples State of Socialist premier  |Kurt_Eisner|Kurt_Eisner| , William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany, New York, NY, Simon & Schuster, 2011, p. 33 interpreted this as an abdication. To date, however, no member of the House of Wittelsbach has ever formally declared renunciation of the throne.  On the other hand, none has ever since officially called upon their Bavarian or Stuart claims. Family members are active in cultural and social life, including the head of the house,  |Franz_Duke_of_Bavaria|Franz_Duke_Of_Bavaria| . They step back from any announcements on public affairs, showing approval or disapproval solely by Franzs presence or absence.     Eisner was assassinated in February 1919, ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short-lived  |Bavarian_Soviet_Republic|Bavarian_Soviet_Republic|  being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the  |Freikorps|Freikorps| , the Bavarian Soviet Republic fell in May 1919. The  |Bamberg_Constitution|Constitution_Of_Bavaria|   was enacted on 12 or 14 August 1919 and came into force on 15 September 1919 creating the Free State of Bavaria within the  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| . Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923  |Beer_Hall_Putsch|Beer_Hall_Putsch|  led by the  |National_Socialists|Nsdap| , and Munich and Nuremberg became seen as  |Nazi|Nazism|  strongholds under the  |Third_Reich|Third_Reich|  of  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler| . However, in the crucial  |German_federal_election_March_1933|German_Federal_Election_March_1933| , the Nazis received less than 50% of the votes cast in Bavaria.     As a manufacturing centre, Munich was heavily bombed during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  and was occupied by U.S. troops, becoming a major part of the American Zone of  |Allied_occupied_Germany|Allied_Occupied_Germany|  and then of  |_Bizonia_|Bizone| .     The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state  |Rhineland_Palatinate|Rhineland_Palatinate| . During the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| , Bavaria was part of  |West_Germany|West_Germany| . In 1949, the Free State of Bavaria chose not to sign the Founding Treaty  for the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany, opposing the division of Germany into two states, after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . The  |Bavarian_Parliament|Landtag_Of_Bavaria|  did not sign the  |Basic_Law_of_Germany|Basic_Law_Of_Germany| , mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual LÃ¤nder, but at the same time decided that it would still come into force in Bavaria if two-thirds of the other LÃ¤nder ratified it. All of the other LÃ¤nder ratified it, and so it became law.       Bavarians have often emphasized a separate national identity and considered themselves as Bavarians first, Germans second.  .

This feeling started to come about more strongly among Bavarians when the  |Kingdom_of_Bavaria|Kingdom_Of_Bavaria|  joined the Protestant Prussian-dominated  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  while the  |Bavarian_nationalists|Bavarian_Nationalism|  wanted to keep Bavaria as Catholic and an independent state. Nowadays, aside from the minority  |Bavaria_Party|Bavaria_Party| , most Bavarians accept that Bavaria is part of Germany. Lunau, Kate.  , Macleans.ca, 25 June 2009, Retrieved on 2013-07-16. Another consideration is that Bavarians foster different cultural identities:  |Franconia|Franconia|  in the north, speaking  |East_Franconian_German|East_Franconian_German| ; Bavarian Swabia in the south west, speaking  |Swabian_German|Swabian_German| ; and  |Altbayern|Altbayern|  speaking  |Austro_Bavarian|Bavarian_Language| . In Munich, the Old Bavarian dialect was widely spread, but nowadays  |High_German|High_German_Languages|  is predominantly spoken there. Moreover, by the  |expulsion_of_German_speakers_from_Eastern_Europe|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans| , Bavaria has received a large population that was not traditionally Bavarian. In particular, the  |Sudeten_Germans|Sudeten_Germans| , expelled from neighboring  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , have been deemed to have become the fourth tribe of Bavarians.                 Uniquely among German states, Bavaria has two official flags of equal status, one with a white and blue stripe, the other with white and blue  |lozenges|Lozenge| . Either may be used by civilians and government offices, who are free to choose between them.  Unofficial versions of the flag, especially a lozenge style with coat of arms, are sometimes used by civilians.              The modern coat of arms of Bavaria was designed by Eduard Ege in 1946, following heraldic traditions.   The Golden Lion: At the dexter chief, sable, a  |lion|Lion|  rampant Or, armed and langued gules. This represents the administrative region of Upper Palatinate.   The  |Franconian_Rake|Franconian_Rake|  : At the sinister chief, per  |fess|Fess|  dancetty, gules, and argent. This represents the administrative regions of Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia.   The Blue Pantier  |inescutcheon|Escutcheon|  of white and blue fusils askance was originally the coat of arms of the Counts of Bogen, adopted in 1247 by the House of Wittelsbach. The white-and-blue fusils are indisputably the emblem of Bavaria and these arms today symbolize Bavaria as a whole. Along with the Peoples Crown, it is officially used as the Minor Coat of Arms.   The Peoples Crown  |crown|Crown|  with a golden band inset with precious stones and decorated with five ornamental leaves. This crown first appeared in the coat of arms to symbolize sovereignty of  |the_people|Common_People|  after the royal crown was eschewed in 1923.          Bavaria shares international borders with  |Austria|Austria|   and the  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic|  , as well as with  |Switzerland|Switzerland|  . Because all of these countries are part of the  |Schengen_Area|Schengen_Area| , the border is completely open. Neighboring states within Germany are  |Baden_WÃ¼rttemberg|Baden_WÃ¼rttemberg| , Hesse,  |Thuringia|Thuringia| , and  |Saxony|Saxony| . Two major rivers flow through the state: the  |Danube|Danube|   and the  |Main|Main| . The  |Bavarian_Alps|Bavarian_Alps|  define the border with Austria , and within the range is the highest peak in Germany: the  |Zugspitze|Zugspitze| . The  |Bavarian_Forest|Bavarian_Forest|  and the  |Bohemian_Forest|Bohemian_Forest|  form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czech Republic and Bohemia.     The major cities in Bavaria are  |Munich|Munich|  ,  |Nuremberg|Nuremberg|  ,  |Augsburg|Augsburg| ,  |Regensburg|Regensburg| ,  |WÃ¼rzburg|WÃ¼rzburg| ,  |Ingolstadt|Ingolstadt| ,  |FÃ¼rth|FÃ¼rth| , and  |Erlangen|Erlangen| .

In the other larger states of Germany, there are  which are only administrative divisions and not self-governing entities as the  in Bavaria.       The second communal layer is made up of 71 rural districts  that are comparable to counties, as well as the 25 independent cities , both of which share the same administrative responsibilities .          Rural districts:        Independent cities:          The 71 administrative districts are on the lowest level divided into 2,031 regular municipalities . Together with the 25 independent cities , there are a total of 2,056 municipalities in Bavaria.

Source: Bayerisches Landesamt fÃ¼r Statistik und Datenverarbeitung                        Bavaria has a multiparty system dominated by the conservative  |Christian_Social_Union|Christian_Social_Union_Of_Bavaria|  , which has won every election since 1945, The Greens, which became the second biggest political party in the 2018 parliament elections and the center-left  |Social_Democrats|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  , which dominates in  |Munich|Munich| . Thus far  |Wilhelm_Hoegner|Wilhelm_Hoegner|  has been the only SPD candidate to ever become Minister-President; notable successors in office include multi-term Federal Minister  |Franz_Josef_Strauss|Franz_Josef_Strauss| , a key figure among  |West_German|West_German|  conservatives during the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  years, and  |Edmund_Stoiber|Edmund_Stoiber| , who both failed with their bids for  |Chancellorship|Federal_Chancellor_Of_Germany| . The German  |Greens|Alliance_90_The_Greens|  and the center-right  |Free_Voters|Free_Voters_Of_Bavaria|  have been represented in the state parliament since 1986 and 2008 respectively.     In the  |2003_elections|Bavaria_State_Election_2003|  the CSU won a  |â_supermajority|Supermajority|  â something no party had ever achieved in postwar Germany. However, in the subsequent  |2008_elections|Bavaria_State_Election_2008|  the CSU lost the absolute majority for the first time in 46 years.   The losses were partly attributed by some to the CSUs stance for an anti-smoking bill. .            The  |last_state_elections|Bavarian_State_Election_2018|  were held on 14 October 2018 in which the CSU lost its absolute majority in the state parliament in part due to the partys stances as part of the federal government, winning 37.2% of the vote; the partys second worst election outcome in its history. The Greens who had surged in the polls leading up to the election have replaced the social-democratic SPD as the second biggest force in the  |Landtag|Landtag_Of_Bavaria|  with 17.5% of the vote. The SPD lost over half of its previous share compared to 2013 with a mere 9.7% in 2018. The liberals of the FDP were again able to reach the five-percent-threshold in order to receive mandates in parliament after they were not part of the Landtag after the 2013 elections. Also entering the new parliament will be the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany with 10.2% of the vote.  The center-right Free Voters party gained 11.6% of the vote and formed a government coalition with the CSU which lead to the subsequent reelection of Markus SÃ¶der as  |Minister_President_of_Bavaria|Minister_President_Of_Bavaria| .       The  |Constitution_of_Bavaria|Constitution_Of_Bavaria|  of the Free State of Bavaria was enacted on 8 December 1946. The new Bavarian Constitution became the basis for the Bavarian State after the Second World War.     Bavaria has a  |unicameral|Unicameral|   , elected by universal suffrage. Until December 1999, there was also a , or  |Senate|Bavarian_Senate| , whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished.     The Bavarian State Government consists of the  |Minister_President_of_Bavaria|Minister_President_Of_Bavaria| , eleven Ministers and six Secretaries of State. The Minister-President is elected for a period of five years by the State Parliament and is head of state. With the approval of the State Parliament he appoints the members of the State Government. The State Government is composed of the:     Ministry of the Interior, Building and Transport    Ministry of Education and Culture, Science and Art    Ministry of Finance, for Rural Development and Homeland    Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology    Ministry of Environment and Consumer Protection    Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Family and Integration    Ministry of Justice    Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Forestry    Ministry of Public Health and Care Services      Political processes also take place in the seven regions  in Bavaria, in the 71 administrative districts  and the 25 towns and cities forming their own districts , and in the 2,031 local authorities .     In 1995 Bavaria introduced  |direct_democracy|Direct_Democracy|  on the local level in a  |referendum|Referendum| . This was initiated bottom-up by an association called Mehr Demokratie . This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court tightened the regulations considerably . Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens participation in communal and municipal affairsâ835 referenda took place from 1995 through 2005.                    Unlike most German states , which simply designate themselves as State of , Bavaria uses the style of Free State of Bavaria . The difference from other states is purely terminological, as German constitutional law does not draw a distinction between States and Free States . The situation is thus analogous to the United States, where  |some_states|Commonwealth|  use the style Commonwealth rather than State . The choice of Free State , a creation of the early 20th century and intended to be a German alternative to the Latin-derived republic, has historical reasons, Bavaria having been styled that way even before the current 1946 Constitution was enacted . Two other states,  |Saxony|Saxony|  and  |Thuringia|Thuringia| , also use the style Free State ; unlike Bavaria, however, these were not part of the original states when the  |Grundgesetz|Grundgesetz|  was enacted but joined the federation later on, in 1990, as a result of  |German_reunification|German_Reunification| . Saxony had used the designation as Free State from 1918 to 1952.       In July 2017, Bavarias parliament enacted a new revision of the GefÃ¤hrdergesetz , allowing the authorities to imprison a person for a three months term, renewable indefinitely, when he or she has not committed a crime but it is assumed that he or she might commit a crime in the near future . ,  |SÃ¼ddeutsche_Zeitung|SÃ¼ddeutsche_Zeitung| , 19 July 2017 Critics like the prominent journalist  |Heribert_Prantl|Heribert_Prantl|  have called the law shameful and compared it to  |Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp|Guantanamo_Bay_Detention_Camp| , , Heribert Prantl, 20 July 2017 assessed it to be in violation of the  |European_Convention_on_Human_Rights|European_Convention_On_Human_Rights| , , Udo Vetter, 20 July 2017 and also compared it to the legal situation in Russia, where a similar law allows for imprisonment for a maximum term of two years ,  |Felix_von_Leitner|Felix_Von_Leitner| , 20 July 2017             Bavaria has long had one of the largest economies of any region in Germany, and in Europe. Its GDP is 143% of the EU average  whilst the German average is 121.5%. Source:  Its GDP in 2007 exceeded â¬434  billion .  This makes Bavaria itself one of the largest economies in Europe, and only 20 countries in the world have a higher GDP. See the  |list_of_countries_by_GDP|List_Of_Countries_By_Gdp| . Large companies headquartered in Bavaria include  |BMW|Bmw| ,  |Siemens|Siemens| ,  |Rohde_Schwarz|Rohde_Schwarz| ,  |Audi|Audi| ,  |MTU_Aero_Engines|Mtu_Aero_Engines| ,  |Munich_Re|Munich_Re| ,  |Allianz|Allianz| ,  |Infineon|Infineon| ,  |MAN_SE|Man_Se| ,  |Wacker_Chemie|Wacker_Chemie| ,  |Puma|Puma_Se| ,  |Adidas|Adidas| , and  |Ruf|Ruf_Automobile| . Bavaria has a GDP per capita of over U.S. $48,000; if it were an independent country it would rank 7th or 8th in the world. Bavaria has strong economic ties with Austria, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and Northern Italy.

Noteworthy differences can be found with respect to religion, traditions, and language.             Bavarian culture  has a long and predominant tradition of  |Catholic|Catholic_Church|  faith. Pope emeritus  |Benedict_XVI_|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  was born in  |Marktl_am_Inn|Marktl_Am_Inn|  in  |Upper_Bavaria|Upper_Bavaria|  and was  |Cardinal_Archbishop_of_Munich_and_Freising|Archbishop_Of_Munich_And_Freising| . Otherwise, the culturally  |Franconia|Franconia| n and  |Swabia|Swabia| n regions of the modern State of Bavaria are historically more diverse in religiosity, with both Catholic and  |Protestant|Protestant|  traditions. In 1925, 70.0% of the Bavarian population was  |Catholic|Catholic_Church| , 28.8% was  |Protestant|Protestant| , 0.7% was  |Jewish|Jewish| , and 0.5% was placed in other religious categories. Grundriss der Statistik. II. Gesellschaftsstatistik by Wilhelm Winkler, p. 36      49.6% of Bavarians adhered to Catholicism .   18.3% of the population adheres to the  |Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_Bavaria|Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_In_Bavaria| , which has also declined since 1970. 3% was  |Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| ,  |Muslims|Muslim|  make up 4.0% of the population of Bavaria. 28.1% of Bavarians are irreligious or adhere to other religions.       Bavarians commonly emphasize pride in their traditions. Traditional costumes collectively known as  |Tracht|Tracht|  are worn on special occasions and include in  |Altbayern|Altbayern| |_Lederhosen|Lederhosen|  for males and  |Dirndl|Dirndl|  for females. Centuries-old  |folk_music|Folk_Music|  is performed. The  |Maibaum|Maypole_Tradition_In_Bavaria| , or Maypole , and the bagpipes of the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the  |ancient_Celtic_and_Germanic|Paganism_In_The_Eastern_Alps|  remnants of cultural heritage of the region. There are many traditional Bavarian sports disciplines, e.g. the  |Aperschnalzen|Aperschnalzen| , competitive  |whipcracking|Whipcracking| .     Whether actually in Bavaria, overseas or with citizens from other nations Bavarians continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their heritage alive. In New York City the German American Cultural Society is a larger umbrella group for others which represent a specific part of Germany, including the Bavarian organizations. They present a German parade called  |Steuben_Parade|Steuben_Parade|  each year. Various affiliated events take place amongst its groups, one of which is the Bavarian Dancers.       Bavarians tend to place a great value on  |food_and_drink|Bavarian_Cuisine| . In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example  or in some instances a variety of entrails. At folk festivals and in many  |beer_gardens|Beer_Garden| , beer is traditionally served by the litre . Bavarians are particularly proud of the traditional , or beer purity law, initially established by the  |Duke_of_Bavaria|Duke_Of_Bavaria|  for the City of Munich in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water,  |barley|Barley| , and  |hops|Hops| . In 1906 the  made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the EU partly struck it down in 1987 as incompatible with the European common market.  German breweries, however, cling to the principle, and Bavarian breweries still comply with it in order to distinguish their beer brands.  Bavarians are also known as some of the worlds most beer-loving people with an average annual consumption of 170 liters per person, although figures have been declining in recent years.     Bavaria is also home to the  |Franconia_wine_region|Franconia| , which is situated along the  |Main_River|Main_River|  in Franconia. The region has produced wine  for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the  |Bocksbeutel|Bocksbeutel|  wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals throughout the year.            Three German dialects are most commonly spoken in Bavaria:  |Austro_Bavarian|Austro_Bavarian|  in Old Bavaria ,  |Swabian_German|Swabian_German|   in the Bavarian part of Swabia and  |East_Franconian_German|East_Franconian_German|  in Franconia . In the small town  |Ludwigsstadt|Ludwigsstadt|  in the north, district Kronach in Upper Franconia,  |Thuringian_dialect|Thuringian_Dialect|  is spoken. During the 20th century an increasing part of the population began to speak  |Standard_German|Standard_German|  , mainly in the cities.       Bavarians consider themselves to be  |egalitarian|Egalitarianism|  and informal. Their sociability can be experienced at the annual  |Oktoberfest|Oktoberfest| , the worlds largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous  |beer_gardens|Beer_Garden| . In traditional Bavarian beer gardens, patrons may bring their own food but buy beer only from the brewery that runs the beer garden.      In the United States, particularly among  |German_Americans|German_Americans| , Bavarian culture is viewed somewhat nostalgically, and several Bavarian villages have been founded, most notably  |Frankenmuth_Michigan|Frankenmuth_Michigan| ;  |Helen_Georgia|Helen_Georgia| ; and  |Leavenworth_Washington|Leavenworth_Washington| . Since 1962, the latter has been styled with a Bavarian theme and is home to an Oktoberfest celebration it claims is among the most attended in the world outside of Munich.        According to the Mitte study of 2015 by  |Leipzig_University|Leipzig_University| , 33.1% of Bavarians agree with  |xenophobic|Xenophobia|  statements. This is the highest approval rate among  |West_German_federal_states|Old_States_Of_Germany|  and the second highest nationwide . In addition, Bavaria has with 12.6% the highest approval for  |anti_Semitic|Antisemitism|  statements of all federal states . Thus, xenophobic and anti-Semitic attitudes are widespread in Bavaria.                Bavaria is home to several football clubs including  |FC_Bayern_Munich|Fc_Bayern_Munich| ,  |1_FC_NÃ¼rnberg|1_Fc_NÃ¼rnberg| ,  |FC_Augsburg|Fc_Augsburg| ,  |TSV_1860_Munich|Tsv_1860_Munich| ,  |FC_Ingolstadt_04|Fc_Ingolstadt_04|  and  |SpVgg_Greuther_FÃ¼rth|Spvgg_Greuther_FÃ¼rth| .
