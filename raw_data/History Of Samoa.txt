   The  |Samoan_Islands|Samoan_Islands|  were first settled some 3,500 years ago as part of the  |Austronesian_expansion|Austronesian_Languageshistory| . Samoas early and more current history is strongly connected with the histories of  |Tonga|Tonga|  and  |Fiji|Fiji| , which are in the same region, and with whom it shares historical, genealogical, and cultural traditions.      |European_exploration|Age_Of_Discovery|  first reached the islands in the early 18th century.    |Louis-Antoine_de_Bougainville|Louis-Antoine_De_Bougainville|  named them Navigator Islands in 1768.   The  |United_States_Exploring_Expedition|United_States_Exploring_Expedition|  under  |Charles_Wilkes|Charles_Wilkes|  reached Samoa in 1839.   In 1855  |J.C._Godeffroy_&_Sohn|Johann_Cesar_Vi._Godeffroy|  expanded its trading business into the archipelago.   The  |Samoan_Civil_War|Samoan_Civil_War|  of 1886  1894 devolved into the  |Samoan_crisis|Samoan_Crisis|  between colonial powers, followed by the  |Second_Samoan_Civil_War|Second_Samoan_Civil_War|  of 1898/9, which was resolved by partition of the islands in the  |Tripartite_Convention|Tripartite_Convention| , between the  |United_States|United_States| ,  |Great_Britain|British_Empire|  and  |Germany|German_Empire|      After World War I,  |German_Samoa|German_Samoa|  became a  |Trust_Territory|Western_Samoa_Trust_Territory|  and eventually became independent as  |Samoa|Samoa|  in 1962.  |American_Samoa|American_Samoa|  remains an  |unincorporated_territory_of_the_United_States|Unincorporated_Territory_Of_The_United_States| .            Archeologists place the earliest human settlement of the  |Samoan_archipelago|Samoan_Archipelago|  at around 2850 years before present. This date is based upon the ancient  |lapita|Lapita_Culture|  pottery shards found throughout the islands; The oldest evidence being in Mulifanua.  This area of Polynesia, Samoa and Tonga, contains evidence from dates of similar times, suggesting the area was settled during the same period. Samoan oral history, however, extends only as far back as AD 1000. Whatever occurred between 750  BC and AD 1000 remains a mystery, though this may have been the period of great migrations that led to the settlement of present-day  |Polynesia|Polynesia| . Another mystery is that the making of pottery suddenly stopped; there is no oral tradition among the people of Samoa that explains this but some theories suggest the lack of available pottery-making materials in Polynesia meant the majority of pottery was imported during migration and not locally sourced or made.     Tagaloa was a dynasty that ruled a pacific empire around Fiji Tonga Samoa, before the emergence of the Tui Manua.     Ancient Samoan oral traditions known only by direct descendants speak of Lumatagi, Lu of the winds who discovered New Zealand, and saw icebergs in the south. He named New Zealand Savaii laulau. Stretched out Savaii as they often named volcanic islands after Savaii. He had a gigantic canoe called blink of an eye because it was so fast. He was also Lufasiaitu, Lu the ghost slayer, who defeated Tagaloa and finally ended his power. His grandfather had discovered Hawaii.        Linguistically, the  |Samoan_language|Samoan_Language|  belongs to the  |Polynesian|Polynesian_Languages|  sub-branch of the  |Austronesian_language_family|Austronesian_Languages| , whose origin is thought to be in Taiwan.     According to oral tradition, Samoa shares the common Polynesian ancestor of  |Tagaloa|Tagaloa| .  The very earliest history of Samoa concerns a political center in the easternmost Samoan islands of  |Manua|Manua| , under the rule of the  |Tui_Manua|Tui_Manua| . In the Cook Islands to the east, the tradition is that Karika, or Tui Manua Alia, came to the Cook Islands from Manua; suggesting that it was from Manua and Samoa that the rest of Polynesia developed.     The Tui Manua gained his name when he first defeated Tagaloa in a battle over the Faleula , and in doing so was injured gaining the name Tui Manua approximately 2,000 years ago.   Also there are oral traditions that the name of Samoa based upon Sa Moa sacred center, where Lu finally defeated Tagaloa and took all his power and married his daughter. The TuiAtua was one of Tagaloas titles. Moa was also the family name of the Tui Manua so another interpretation is that SaMoa is the family of Moa, the Tui Manua. Tui Manua and Leifi TuiAtua Faanonofo ruled Samoa. Tui Manua was the elder brother and there are still 2 posts in the meeting house of the Tui Manua where only two kings are allowed to sit. The Tui Manua and Leifi. The Tui Manua controlled a pacific empire, extending over Tonga Fiji, cook islands etc, and Leifi was his war leader. He also fought internal wars. The Red fish of Manua went to war and destroyed the Shark of Savaii.     Leifi also would bestow another TuiAtua title. The TuiAtiua title has always been bestowed by Leifi, mostly in the last 1,000 years at his malae of Kings at Lufilufi. Various families and people would competeeg sons of the TuiManua and Leifi would decide who he would give it to. In more modern times, it was mainly the Tama Aiga that Leifi/Fuataga would bestow the TuiAtua on, eg Salamasina.   The Papa or 4 titles were all originally created by Leifi, but were later brought together by the Tama Aiga as an important collection of titles. Leifi bestowed the Tui Atua and created the Tui Aana. He had originally made the Vaetamasoalii and the Ngailetoatele which the people of Aana and Tuamasaga had asked for, as he would not give them a Tui title. However he had destroyed these lesser titles when he created the TuiAana title at his malae, at the last Tofiga of Kings with the Tui Manua present. This was the last Samoan Tui created.     This was for services rendered to him by the people of Aaana in a war against Tuamasaga. This was over the theft of the Pua tree and the people of Aana had located it with the Tuamasaga, and killed many to return it. They had piled the bodies of the Tuamasaga warriors as high as a tree, so the saying goes, piled as high as a tree. Then they returned it to Fogaa. Thereby the saying , take all good things to FGogaa.     Later the 2 lesser titles were used as womens names and these similar ones were passed off as the ancient original ones. These are the Natoitele, and Tamasoalii.     The Tui Manua was ended by the US govt. The bestowed TuiAtua ruled Samoa, but part of Samoa was taken over during the Tongan invasion.     Originally Samoans and Tongans were one people, but as numbers increased, Fiji and Tonga became separate and then made their own Tui titles, Tuifiti and TuiTonga. One of Leifis titles was Defender of Manua, and his island was Tutuila. Leifi fought off many waves of invasion from Fiji and Tonga.   Leifi became Fuataga , TuiAtua Faanofonofo , the Matua, . Leifi also created and bestowed the Tui Aana title and gave the people of Aana control and right to bestow it. There is an ancient saying All honours of Samoa come from Leifi . However in modern historic times, the Govt and the Tama Aiga now control Samoa.     Samoas history early was interwoven with that of certain chiefdoms of  |Fiji|Fiji|  as well as the history of the kingdom of  |Tonga|Tonga| . The oral history of Samoa preserves the memories of many battles fought between Samoa and neighboring islands. Too, intermarriage of Tongan and Fijian royalty to Samoan nobility has helped build close relationships between these island nations that exist to the present; these royal blood ties are acknowledged at special events and cultural gatherings. Other Samoan folklore tells of the arrival of two maidens from Fiji who brought the tools necessary to create the art of tatau, or in English  |tattoo|Tattoo| , whence came the traditional Samoan malofie .     The foundation of the cultural tradition of Samoa, or the  |faasamoa|Faasamoa|  came with the rise of the warrior queen  |Nafanua|Nafanua| . Her rule instituted traditions of the  |faamatai|Faamatai|  or local family and village and regional chiefly systems, a decentralized system. Her niece  |Salamasina|Salamasina|  continued under this system and their time is considered a golden age of Samoan cultural traditions.     For a long period, a Tongan aristocracy ruled in Samoa. However they did not defeat all of Samoa. They conquered Upolu, not where the Tui Manua was. The highly reverential title Malietoa refers to the parting words of Tongan warriors, Malie toa, malie tau . This was given by The Tongan King after having finally been driven out of Samoa. The title was amended as part of the more ancient royal courts and titles of Tui Aana, Tui Atua.             Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century but did not intensify until the arrival of the  |British|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain|  missionaries. In 1722,  |Dutchman|Netherlands| |Jacob_Roggeveen|Jacob_Roggeveen|  was the first European to see the islands. This visit was followed by the French explorer  |Louis-Antoine_de_Bougainville|Louis-Antoine_De_Bougainville|  , the man who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. In 1787  |Jean-François_de_Galaup,_comte_de_Lapérouse|Jean-François_De_Galaup,_Comte_De_Lapérouse|  visited Samoa, where at Tutuila Island, in what is now American Samoa, there was a conflict leading to deaths on both sides, including the deaths of twelve Frenchmen.       European and Tahitian and Cook Islander  |Missionaries|Missionary|  and traders, led by  |John_Williams|John_Williams|  began arriving around 1830. Coming via Tahiti, they were known in Samoa as the Lotu Taiti. The Rev. John Williams was helped by the  |Alii|Alii|  Malietoa Vainuupo to establish the Lotu Taiti, which became the  |Christian_Congregational_Church_of_Samoa|Christian_Congregational_Church_Of_Samoa| .     The  |United_States_Exploring_Expedition|United_States_Exploring_Expedition|  under  |Charles_Wilkes|Charles_Wilkes|  reached Samoa in 1839 and appointed an Englishman, John C. Williams, son of the missionary, as acting U.S. consul. However this appointment was never confirmed by the  |U.S._State_Department|U.S._State_Department| ; John C. Williams was merely recognized as Commercial Agent of the United States . A British consul was already residing at  |Apia|Apia| .     In 1855  |J.C._Godeffroy_&_Sohn|Johann_Cesar_Vi._Godeffroy|  expanded its trading business into the  |Samoan_Islands|Samoan_Islands| , which were then known as the Navigator Islands. During the second half of the 19th century  |German|German_Empire|  influence in  |Samoa|Samoa|  expanded with large plantation operations being introduced for coconut, cacao and hevea rubber cultivation, especially on the island of Upolu where German firms monopolized  |copra|Copra|  and  |cocoa_bean|Cocoa_Bean|  processing. British business enterprises, harbour rights, and consulate office were the basis on which Britain had cause to intervene in Samoa. The United States began operations at the harbor of  |Pago_Pago|Pago_Pago|  on  |Tutuila|Tutuila|  in 1877 and formed alliances with local native chieftains, most conspicuously on the islands of  |Tutuila|Tutuila|  and  |Manua|Manua|  .     In the 1880s Great Britain, Germany and the United States all claimed parts of the kingdom of Samoa, and established trade posts. The rivalry between these powers exacerbated the indigenous factions that were struggling to preserve their ancient political system. The islands were divided among the three powers in the 1890s, And between the United States and Germany in 1899. Paul M. Kennedy, The Samoan Tangle: A Study in Anglo-German-American Relations 1878–1900 .                The First  |Samoan_Civil_War|Samoan_Civil_War|  was fought roughly between 1886 and 1894, primarily between rival Samoan factions, although the rival powers intervened on several occasions with military forces. There followed an  |eight-year_civil_war|Samoan_Civil_War| , where each of the three powers supplied arms, training, and in some cases, combat troops to the warring Samoan parties.  The  |Samoan_crisis|Samoan_Crisis|  came to a critical juncture in March 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into  |Apia_harbour|Apia_Harbour| , and a larger-scale war seemed imminent, until a massive storm on 15 March 1889 damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict.       |Robert_Louis_Stevenson|Robert_Louis_Stevenson|  arrived in Samoa in 1889 and built a house at  |Vailima|Vailima,_Samoa| . He quickly became passionately involved in the attendant political machinations. His influence spread to the Samoans, who consulted him for advice, and he soon became involved in local politics. These involved the three colonial powers battling for control of Samoa - America, Germany and Britain - and the indigenous factions struggling to preserve their ancient political system. He was convinced that the European officials appointed to rule the Samoans were incompetent, and after many futile attempts to resolve the matter, he published  A Footnote to History . The book covers the period from 1882 to 1892. This was such a stinging protest against existing conditions that it resulted in the recall of two officials, and Stevenson feared for a time it would result in his own deportation. Letter to Sidney Colvin, 17 April 1893, Vailima Letters,  |Chapter_XXVIII|S:Vailima_Letters/Chapter_Xxviii|              The  |Second_Samoan_Civil_War|Second_Samoan_Civil_War|  reached a head in 1898 when Germany, Great Britain and the United States disputed over who should control the Samoan Islands.     The  Battle of Apia  occurred in March 1899. Samoan forces loyal to  |Prince_Tanu|Prince_Tanu|  were besieged by a larger force of Samoan rebels loyal to powerful chief  |Mataafa_Iosefo|Mataafa_Iosefo| . Supporting Prince Tanu were landing parties from four British and American warships. Over several days of fighting, the Samoan rebels were defeated. Mains, P. John; McCarty, Louis Philippe . The Statistician and Economist: Volume 23. p. 249     American and British warships shelled  |Apia|Apia|  on 15 March 1899; including the  |USS_Philadelphia|Uss_Philadelphia| . Following the initial defeat at Apia, Mataafas rebels defeated a combined American, British and Tanu allied force at  |Vailele|Second_Battle_Of_Vailele|  on 1 April 1899, with the allies in retreat.  According to a war correspondent associated with the Auckland Star newspaper, the aftermath saw Mataafas warriors leaving American and British corpses on the field being severed of their heads.  Papers Past Germany, Britain and the United States quickly resolved to end the hostilities by partitioning the island chain at the  |Tripartite_Convention_of_1899|Tripartite_Convention| . Ryden, George Herbert. The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa. , p. 574; the Tripartite Convention was signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900. With Tanu and his American and British allies inability to defeat him in war, the Tripartite resulted in Mataafa being promoted to Alii Sii, the high chief of Samoa.          The  |Samoa_Tripartite_Convention_of_1899|Tripartite_Convention| , a joint commission of three members composed of  |Bartlett_Tripp|Bartlett_Tripp|  for the United States, C. N. E. Eliot, C.B. for Great Britain, and Freiherr Speck von Sternburg for Germany, agreed to divide the islands.     The Tripartite Convention gave control of the islands west of 171 degrees west longitude to Germany, , containing  |Upolu|Upolu|  and  |Savaii|Savaii|   and other adjoining islands. These islands became known as  |German_Samoa|German_Samoa| .   The United States was given control the eastern islands of  |Tutuila|Tutuila|  and  |Manua|Manua| , . In exchange for Britain ceding claims in Samoa, Germany transferred their protectorates in the  |North_Solomon_Islands|North_Solomon_Islands|  and other territories in West Africa. It does not appear that any Samoans were consulted about the partition and the monarchy was also abolished.                From 1908, with the establishment of the  |Mau_movement|Mau_Movement|  , Western Samoans began to assert their claim to independence. The Mau movement began in 1908 with the ‘Mau a Pule resistance on Savaii, led by orator chief  |Lauaki_Namulauulu_Mamoe|Lauaki_Namulauulu_Mamoe| . Lauaki and Mau a Pule chiefs, wives and children were exiled to  |Saipan|Saipan|  in 1909. Many died in exile.      |World_War_I|World_War_I|  broke out in August 1914, and soon after,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  sent an expeditionary force to  |seize_and_occupy_German_Samoa|Fall_Of_German_Samoa| . Although Germany refused to officially surrender the islands, no resistance was offered and the occupation took place without any fighting. New Zealand continued the occupation of Western Samoa throughout World War I. Under the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  in 1919, Germany relinquished its claims to the islands.     In November 1918, the  |Spanish_flu|1918_Flu_Pandemic|  strongly hit the territory. 90% of the 38,302 native inhabitants were infected and 20% died. The American Samoa population was largely spared this devastation, due to vigorous efforts of its Governor. This led to some Samoan citizens petitioning in January 1919 for transfer to U.S administration, or at least general British administration. The petition was recalled a few days later.     The Mau movement gained momentum with Samoas royal leaders becoming more visible in supporting the movement but opposing violence. On 28 December 1929 Tupua Tamasese was shot along with eleven others during an otherwise peaceful demonstration in Apia. Tupua Tamasese died the following day; his final words included a plea that no more blood be shed.     New Zealand administered Western Samoa, or Samoa i Sisifo in the Samoan language, first as a  |League_of_Nations_Mandate|League_Of_Nations_Mandate|  and then as a  |United_Nations_Trust_Territory|United_Nations_Trust_Territory|  until the country received its independence on 1 January 1962 as  |Western_Samoa|Western_Samoa| .  Samoas first prime minister following independence was paramount chief  |Fiame_Mataafa_Faumuina_Mulinuu_II|Fiame_Mataafa_Faumuina_Mulinuu_Ii| .     Samoa i Sisifo was the first  |Polynesia|Polynesia| n people to be recognized as a sovereign nation in the 20th century. Samoa became one of the  |Member_states_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations|Member_States_Of_The_Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  on 28 August 1970. In 1977, Queen  |Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii|  visited Samoa during her tour of the  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| .     A conflict briefly emerged between Samoa and American Samoa following Samoas decision to drop the adjective Western from its name. The change was made by an act of the  |Legislative_Assembly_of_Western_Samoa|Legislative_Assembly_Of_Samoa|  adopted on 4 July 1997. Constitution Amendment Act 1997 The step caused surprise and uproar in neighboring American Samoa, as for some American Samoans the change of name implied a claim to be the real Samoa and implied that American Samoa was just an American appendix. Migration happens: reasons, effects and opportunities of Migration, Katarina Ferro, Margot Wallner and Richard Bedford, 2006. p. 72 Some in the American territory said it implied that there was only one Samoa. Two members of American Samoas legislature traveled to Apia in September 1997 to meet with Samoan head of State  |Malietoa_Tanumafili_II|Malietoa_Tanumafili_Ii| , and lobbied to have the name change reversed in order to maintain peace and good relations. An American Samoan petition to the United Nations for a ban on Samoas using the name Samoa was seriously discussed and ten American Samoan representatives sponsored an unsuccessful bill aimed at preventing American Samoa from recognizing independent Samoas new name. The proposed American Samoan bill was criticized by independent Samoas Prime Minister  |Tofilau_Eti_Alesana|Tofilau_Eti_Alesana|  who called the bill rash and irresponsible .     In 2002, New Zealands prime minister  |Helen_Clark|Helen_Clark|  formally apologized for two incidents during the period of New Zealands administration: a failure in 1918 to  |quarantine|Quarantine|  the , which carried the  |Spanish_flu|1918_Flu_Pandemic|  to Samoa, leading to an epidemic which devastated the Samoan population, and the shooting of leaders of the non-violent  |Mau_movement|Mau_Movement|  during a ceremonial procession in 1929.     In 2007, Samoas first head of state, His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II, died at age 95. He held this title jointly with Tupua Tamasese Lealofi until the latters death in 1963. Malietoa Tanumafili II was Samoas Head of State for 45 years. He was the son of  |Malietoa_Tanumafili_I|Malietoa_Tanumafili_I| , who was the last Samoan king recognized by Europe and the Western World.     Samoas current head of state is His Highness Tui-Atua Tupua Tamasese Tupuola Efi, who was anointed the head of state title with the unanimous endorsement of Samoas Parliament, a symbol of traditional Samoan protocol in alignment with Samoan decision-making stressing the importance of consensus in the 21st century.       As European traders began commercial activities in the Samoan Islands, they imposed their  |datekeeping_system|Gregorian_Calendar|  on their transactions. Thus by the 19th century, Samoan calendars were aligned with those of the other Asiatic countries to the west and south. However, in 1892, American traders convinced the king to alter the countrys dating system to align with the United States; thus the country lived through 4 July 1892, twice. But 119 years later, the economic geography of the island had changed, and most business was being done with Australia and New Zealand.
