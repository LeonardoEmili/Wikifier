           The History of the Netherlands is the history of seafaring people thriving on a lowland  |river_delta|River_Delta|  on the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  in northwestern Europe. Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarized border zone of the  |Roman|Romans_In_The_Netherlands|  Empire. This came under increasing pressure from  |Germanic_peoples|Germanic_Peoples|  moving westwards. As Roman power collapsed and the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  began, three dominant  |Germanic_peoples|Germanic_Peoples|  coalesced in the area,  |Frisians|Frisians|  in the north and coastal areas,  |Low_Saxons|Dutch_Low_Saxon|  in the northeast, and the  |Franks|Franks|  in the south.     During the Middle Ages, the descendants of the  |Carolingian|Carolingian|  dynasty came to dominate the area and then extended their rule to a large part of Western Europe. The region of the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  therefore became part of  |Lower_Lotharingia|Lower_Lotharingia|  within the Frankish  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . For several centuries, lordships such as  |Brabant|Duchy_Of_Brabant| ,  |Holland|County_Of_Holland| ,  |Zeeland|Zeeland| ,  |Friesland|Friesland| ,  |Guelders|Guelders|  and others held a changing patchwork of territories. There was no unified equivalent of the modern Netherlands.     By 1433, the  |Duke_of_Burgundy|Philip_The_Good|  had assumed control over most of the lowlands territories in Lower Lotharingia; he created the  |Burgundian_Netherlands|Burgundian_Netherlands|  which included modern Belgium, Luxembourg, and a part of France.     The Catholic kings of Spain took strong measures against Protestantism, which polarised the peoples of present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The subsequent  |Dutch_revolt|Dutch_Revolt|  led to splitting the Burgundian Netherlands into a Catholic French and Dutch-speaking  |Spanish_Netherlands|Spanish_Netherlands|  , and a northern  |United_Provinces|Dutch_Republic|  , which spoke Dutch and were predominantly Protestant with a Catholic minority. It became the modern Netherlands.     In the  |Dutch_Golden_Age|Dutch_Golden_Age| , which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the  |sciences|List_Of_People_From_The_Dutch_Golden_Agescience| . A rich worldwide  |Dutch_empire|Dutch_Empire|  developed and the  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company|  became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.     During the eighteenth century, the power, wealth and influence of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful  |British|Anglo-Dutch_Wars|  and  |French|Franco-Dutch_War|  neighbours weakened it. The UK seized the North American colony of  |New_Amsterdam|New_Amsterdam| , and renamed it New York . There was growing unrest and  |conflict|Second_Stadtholderless_Periodcrisis_And_The_Orangist_Revolution_Of_1747|  between the  |Orangists|Orangism|  and the  |Patriots|Patriottentijd| . The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French  |Batavian_Republic|Batavian_Republic|  was established in 1795–1806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the  |Kingdom_of_Holland|Kingdom_Of_Holland|  , and later simply a French imperial province.     After the collapse of Napoleon in 1813–15, an expanded  |United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands|United_Kingdom_Of_The_Netherlands|  was created with the  |House_of_Orange|House_Of_Orange-Nassau|  as monarchs, also ruling Belgium and Luxembourg. The King imposed unpopular Protestant reforms on Belgium,  |which_revolted_in_1830|Belgian_Revolution|  and became independent in 1839. After an initially conservative period, following the introduction of the 1848 constitution; the country became a  |parliamentary_democracy|Parliamentary_Democracy|  with a  |constitutional_monarch|Constitutional_Monarch| . Modern-day Luxembourg became officially independent from the Netherlands in 1839, but a personal union remained until 1890. Since 1890, it is ruled by another branch of the House of Nassau.     The Netherlands was neutral during the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , but during the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , it was invaded and occupied by  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| . The Nazis, including many collaborators, rounded up and killed almost all of the countrys Jewish population. When the Dutch resistance increased, the Nazis cut off food supplies to much of the country, causing severe starvation in 1944–45. In 1942, the Dutch East Indies were conquered by Japan, but prior to this; the Dutch destroyed the oil wells for which Japan was desperate.  |Indonesia|Indonesia|  proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945, followed by  |Suriname|Suriname|  in 1975. The post-war years saw rapid economic recovery , followed by the introduction of a  |welfare_state|Welfare_State|  during an era of peace and prosperity. The Netherlands formed a new economic alliance with Belgium and Luxembourg, the  |Benelux|Benelux| , and all three became founding members of the  |European_Union|European_Union|  and  |NATO|Nato| . In recent decades, the Dutch economy has been closely linked to that of Germany and is highly prosperous. The four countries adopted the Euro on 1 January 2002, along with eight other EU member states.                The prehistory of the area that is now the Netherlands was largely shaped by its constantly shifting, low-lying geography.    ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref name CMC  /ref  ref name CMC /  ref nameKooijmans1998  /ref  ref name Kooijmans1998 / ref  /ref ref nameRaemakers  /ref  ref nameBloemers  /ref  ref nameLanting  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref nameMallory  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name Werner Hilgemann p.109  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name Werner Hilgemann p.109 / ref name Verhart  /ref ref  /ref ref name Verhaal  /ref  ref name Verhaal /  ref name Verhaal /  |r|R|  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name Zutphen  /ref  ref name Zutphen / ref name Verhart / ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref name Verhart /  ref  /ref ref name Lendering  /ref  ref name Lendering /  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref .
