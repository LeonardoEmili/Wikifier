                 Fluorescence is the emission of  |light|Light|  by a substance that has absorbed light or other  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation| . It is a form of  |luminescence|Luminescence| . In most cases, the emitted light has a longer  |wavelength|Wavelength| , and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  region of the  |spectrum|Spectrumelectromagnetic_Spectrum| , and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can be seen only when exposed to  |UV_light|Uv_Light| . Fluorescent materials cease to glow nearly immediately when the radiation source stops, unlike  |phosphorescent|Phosphorescence|  materials, which continue to emit light for some time after.     Fluorescence has many practical applications, including  |mineralogy|Mineralogy| ,  |gemology|Gemology| ,  |medicine|Medicine| , chemical sensors ,  |fluorescent_labelling|Fluorescent_Labelling| ,  |dyes|Dye| , biological detectors, cosmic-ray detection, and, most commonly,  |fluorescent_lamps|Fluorescent_Lamp| . Fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in various biological states in many branches of the animal kingdom.             An early observation of fluorescence was described in 1560 by  |Bernardino_de_Sahagún|Bernardino_De_Sahagún|  and in 1565 by  |Nicolás_Monardes|Nicolás_Monardes|  in the  |infusion|Infusion|  known as  lignum nephriticum  . It was derived from the wood of two tree species,  Pterocarpus indicus  and  Eysenhardtia polystachya .     The chemical compound responsible for this fluorescence is matlaline, which is the oxidation product of one of the  |flavonoids|Flavonoid|  found in this wood.     In 1819,  |Edward_D._Clarke|Edward_Daniel_Clarke|   and in 1822  |René_Just_Haüy|René_Just_Haüy|  Haüy merely repeats Clarkes observation regarding the colors of the specimen of fluorite which he had examined: Haüy, Traité de Minéralogie, 2nd ed. , vol. 1,  . Fluorite is called chaux fluatée by Haüy: ... violette par réflection, et verdâtre par transparence au Derbyshire. described fluorescence in  |fluorites|Fluorite| ,  |Sir_David_Brewster|Sir_David_Brewster|  described the phenomenon for  |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll|  in 1833  On page 542, Brewster mentions that when white light passes through an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll, red light is reflected from it. and  |Sir_John_Herschel|Sir_John_Herschel|  did the same for  |quinine|Quinine|  in 1845.       In his 1852 paper on the Refrangibility  of light,  |George_Gabriel_Stokes|George_Gabriel_Stokes|  described the ability of  |fluorspar|Fluorite|  and  |uranium_glass|Uranium_Glass|  to change invisible light beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum into blue light. He named this phenomenon fluorescence : I am almost inclined to coin a word, and call the appearance fluorescence, from fluor-spar as the analogous term opalescence is derived from the name of a mineral.  From page 479, footnote: I am almost inclined to coin a word, and call the appearance fluorescence, from fluor-spar, as the analogous term opalescence is derived from the name of a mineral. The name was derived from the mineral  |fluorite|Fluorite|  , some examples of which contain traces of divalent  |europium|Europium| , which serves as the fluorescent activator to emit blue light. In a key experiment he used a prism to isolate ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and observed blue light emitted by an ethanol solution of quinine exposed by it. Stokes , pages 472–473. In a footnote on page 473, Stokes acknowledges that in 1843,  |Edmond_Becquerel|A._E._Becquerel|  had observed that quinine acid sulfate strongly absorbs ultraviolet radiation . See: Edmond Becquerel   , Comptes rendus, 17 : 882–884; on page 883, Becquerel cites quinine acid sulfate as strongly absorbing ultraviolet light.         Fluorescence occurs when an orbital  |electron|Electron|  of a molecule, atom, or  |nanostructure|Nanostructure| , relaxes to its  |ground_state|Ground_State|  by emitting a  |photon|Photon|  from an  |excited|Excited_State| |singlet_state|Singlet_State| |Lakowicz|Lakowicz| , p. 1     Excitation: S0 + h     S1   Fluorescence : S1   S0 + h   +       Here h  is a generic term for photon energy with h  |Plancks_constant|Plancks_Constant|  and   |frequency|Frequency|  of light. The specific frequencies of exciting and emitted lights are dependent on the particular system.     S 0 is called the ground state of the  |fluorophore|Fluorophore|  , and S 1 is its first excited singlet state.     A molecule in S 1 can relax by various competing pathways. It can undergo non-radiative  |relaxation|Photoluminescencerelaxation|  in which the excitation energy is dissipated as  |heat|Heat|  to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a  |triplet_state|Triplet_State| , which may subsequently relax via  |phosphorescence|Phosphorescence| , or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.     Relaxation from S 1 can also occur through interaction with a second molecule through  |fluorescence_quenching|Quenching| . Molecular  |oxygen|Oxygen|  is an extremely efficient quencher of fluorescence just because of its unusual triplet ground state.     In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation; this phenomenon is known as the  |Stokes_shift|Stokes_Shift| . However, when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is possible for one  |electron|Electron|  to absorb two  |photons|Photon| ; this  |two-photon_absorption|Two-Photon_Absorption|  can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation. The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation, termed resonance fluorescence . Holler, F. James; Skoog, Douglas A. and Crouch, Stanley R. Principles Of Instrumental Analysis. Cengage Learning.      Molecules that are excited through light absorption or via a different process can transfer energy to a second sensitized molecule, which is converted to its excited state and can then fluoresce.       The fluorescence  |quantum_yield|Quantum_Yield|  gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process. It is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed.  |Lakowicz|Lakowicz| , p. 10 Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario . Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications. Wiley-VCH. . p. 64     :         The maximum possible fluorescence quantum yield is 1.0 ; each  |photon|Photon|  absorbed results in a photon emitted. Compounds with quantum yields of 0.10 are still considered quite fluorescent. Another way to define the quantum yield of fluorescence is by the rate of excited state decay:     :         where is the rate constant of  |spontaneous_emission|Spontaneous_Emission|  of radiation and     :       is the sum of all rates of excited state decay. Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are, therefore, often called non-radiative rates , which can include:   dynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction , internal conversion, and  |intersystem_crossing|Intersystem_Crossing| . Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected.     Fluorescence quantum yields are measured by comparison to a standard. The  |quinine|Quinine|  salt quinine sulfate in a  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  solution is a common fluorescence standard.            The fluorescence lifetime refers to the average time the molecule stays in its excited state before emitting a photon. Fluorescence typically follows  |first-order_kinetics|First-Order_Kinetics|     is the decay rate or the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime. This is an instance of  |exponential_decay|Exponential_Decay| . Various radiative and non-radiative processes can de-populate the excited state. In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates:     :   +       where   is the total decay rate,   the radiative decay rate and   the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates . If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short. For commonly used fluorescent compounds, typical excited state decay times for photon emissions with energies from the  |UV|Ultraviolet|  to  |near_infrared|Near_Infrared|  are within the range of 0.5 to 20  |nanoseconds|Nanoseconds| . The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as  |fluorescence_resonance_energy_transfer|Fluorescence_Resonance_Energy_Transfer|  and  |fluorescence-lifetime_imaging_microscopy|Fluorescence-Lifetime_Imaging_Microscopy| .       The  |Jablonski_diagram|Jablonski_Diagram|  describes most of the relaxation mechanisms for excited state molecules. The diagram alongside shows how fluorescence occurs due to the relaxation of certain excited electrons of a molecule.  . PharmaXChange.info.       Fluorophores are more likely to be excited by photons if the transition moment of the fluorophore is parallel to the electric vector of the photon.  |Lakowicz|Lakowicz| , pp. 12–13 The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.     Fluorescence anisotropy can be defined quantitatively as   : r   where I  is the emitted intensity parallel to polarization of the excitation light and I  is the emitted intensity perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation light. Valeur, Bernard, Berberan-Santos, Mario . Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications. Wiley-VCH. . p. 186       Strongly fluorescent pigments often have an unusual appearance which is often described colloquially as a neon color . This phenomenon was termed Farbenglut by  |Hermann_von_Helmholtz|Hermann_Von_Helmholtz|  and fluorence by Ralph M. Evans. It is generally thought to be related to the high brightness of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter than it could possibly be by reflection alone.        There are several general  |rules|Rule_Of_Thumb|  that deal with fluorescence. Each of the following rules has exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding fluorescence .        |Kashas_rule|Kashas_Rule|  dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation.  |IUPAC|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry| .  . Compiled by McNaught, A.D. and Wilkinson, A. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1997. This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha–Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation.       For many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum.  |Lakowicz|Lakowicz| , pp. 6–8 This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the  |Franck–Condon_principle|Franck–Condon_Principle|  which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.          In general, emitted fluorescence light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light.  |Lakowicz|Lakowicz| , pp. 6–7 This phenomenon, known as  |Stokes_shift|Stokes_Shift| , is due to energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed and when a new one is emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.          There are many natural compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the  |greeneye|Greeneye| , have fluorescent structures.         Fluorescence is the temporary absorption of  |electromagnetic|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  wavelengths from the  |visible_light|Visible_Light|  spectrum by fluorescent molecules, and the subsequent emission of light at a lower energy level. When it occurs in a living organism, it is sometimes called biofluorescence. This causes the light that is emitted to be a different color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an  |electron|Electron| , raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescence light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Fluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.  Pumpkin toadlets that live in the Brazilian Atlantic forest are fluorescent.         |Bioluminescence|Bioluminescence|  differs from fluorescence in that it is the natural production of light by chemical reactions within an organism, whereas fluorescence is the absorption and reemission of light from the environment. A firefly and anglerfish are two example of bioluminescent organisms.         |Biophosphorescence|Phosphorescence|  is similar to fluorescence in its requirement of light wavelengths as a provider of excitation energy. The difference here lies in the relative stability of the energized electron. Unlike with fluorescence, in phosphorescence the electron retains stability, emitting light that continues to “glow-in-the-dark” even after the stimulating light source has been removed. Glow-in-the-dark stickers are phosphorescent, but there are no truly phosphorescent animals known.          Pigment cells that exhibit fluorescence are called fluorescent chromatophores, and function somatically similar to regular  |chromatophores|Chromatophore| . These cells are dendritic, and contain pigments called fluorosomes. These pigments contain fluorescent proteins which are activated by K+ ions, and it is their movement, aggregation, and dispersion within the fluorescent chromatophore that cause directed fluorescence patterning.  Fluorescent cells are innervated the same as other chromatphores, like melanophores, pigment cells that contain  |melanin|Melanin| . Short term fluorescent patterning and signaling is controlled by the nervous system. Fluorescent chromatophores can be found in the skin just below the epidermis, amongst other chromatophores.     Epidermal fluorescent cells in fish also respond to hormonal stimuli by the α–MSH and MCH hormones much the same as melanophores. This suggests that fluorescent cells may have color changes throughout the day that coincide with their  |circadian_rhythm|Circadian_Rhythm| .  Fish may also be sensitive to  |cortisol|Cortisol|  induced  |stress_responses|Stress_Response|  to environmental stimuli, such as interaction with a predator or engaging in a mating ritual.         It is suspected by some scientists that  |GFPs|Green_Fluorescent_Protein|  and GFP like proteins began as electron donors activated by light. These electrons were then used for reactions requiring light energy. Functions of fluorescent proteins, such as protection from the sun, conversion of light into different wavelengths, or for signaling are thought to have evolved secondarily.           The incidence of fluorescence across the  |tree_of_life|Tree_Of_Life|  is widespread, and has been studied most extensively in cnidarians and fish. The phenomenon appears to have evolved multiple times in multiple  |tax|Tax| a such as in the anguilliformes , gobioidei , and tetradontiformes , along with the other taxa discussed later in the article. Fluorescence is highly genotypically and phenotypically variable even within ecosystems, in regards to the wavelengths emitted, the patterns displayed, and the intensity of the fluorescence. Generally, the species relying upon camouflage exhibit the greatest diversity in fluorescence, likely because camouflage may be one of the uses of fluorescence.        Currently, relatively little is known about the functional significance of fluorescence and fluorescent proteins. However, it is suspected that fluorescence may serve important functions in signaling and communication,  |mating|Mating| , lures,  |camouflage|Camouflage| ,  |UV_protection|Uv_Protection|  and antioxidation, photoacclimation,  |dinoflagellate|Dinoflagellate|  regulation, and in coral health.        Water absorbs light of long wavelengths, so less light from these wavelengths reflects back to reach the eye. Therefore, warm colors from the visual light spectrum appear less vibrant at increasing depths. Water scatters light of shorter wavelengths above violet, meaning cooler colors dominate the visual field in the  |photic_zone|Photic_Zone| . Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense as it is on the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths. Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence.     Fluorescence is simply defined as the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at one  |wavelength|Wavelength|  and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength. Thus any type of fluorescence depends on the presence of external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause fluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it.    The visual field in the photic zone is naturally blue, so colors of fluorescence can be detected as bright reds, oranges, yellows, and greens. Green is the most commonly found color in the marine spectrum, yellow the second most, orange the third, and red is the rarest. Fluorescence can occur in organisms in the aphotic zone as a byproduct of that same organisms bioluminescence. Some fluorescence in the aphotic zone is merely a byproduct of the organisms tissue biochemistry and does not have a functional purpose. However, some cases of functional and adaptive significance of fluorescence in the aphotic zone of the deep ocean is an active area of research.       |Photic_zone|Photic_Zone|     Bony fishes living in shallow water generally have good color vision due to their living in a colorful environment. Thus, in shallow-water fishes, red, orange, and green fluorescence most likely serves as a means of communication with  |conspecifics|Biological_Specificity| , especially given the great phenotypic variance of the phenomenon.     Many fish that exhibit fluorescence, such as  |sharks|Sharks| ,  |lizardfish|Lizardfish| ,  |scorpionfish|Scorpionfish| ,  |wrasses|Wrasses| , and  |flatfishes|Flatfishes| , also possess yellow intraocular filters.  Yellow intraocular filters in the  |lenses|Lens|  and  |cornea|Cornea|  of certain fishes function as long-pass filters. These filters enable the species that to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence, in order to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fish that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing fluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members of it. Fluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage. Many of these lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.     Another adaptive use of fluorescence is to generate orange and red light from the ambient blue light of the  |photic_zone|Photic_Zone|  to aid vision. Red light can only be seen across short distances due to attenuation of red light wavelengths by water.  Many fish species that fluoresce are small, group-living, or benthic/aphotic, and have conspicuous patterning. This patterning is caused by fluorescent tissue and is visible to other members of the species, however the patterning is invisible at other visual spectra. These intraspecific fluorescent patterns also coincide with intra-species signaling. The patterns present in ocular rings to indicate directionality of an individuals gaze, and along fins to indicate directionality of an individuals movement. Current research suspects that this red fluorescence is used for private communication between members of the same species.  Due to the prominence of blue light at ocean depths, red light and light of longer wavelengths are muddled, and many predatory reef fish have little to no sensitivity for light at these wavelengths. Fish such as the fairy wrasse that have developed visual sensitivity to longer wavelengths are able to display red fluorescent signals that give a high contrast to the blue environment and are conspicuous to conspecifics in short ranges, yet are relatively invisible to other common fish that have reduced sensitivities to long wavelengths. Thus, fluorescence can be used as adaptive signaling and intra-species communication in reef fish.      Additionally, it is suggested that fluorescent  |tissues|Tissue|  that surround an organisms eyes are used to convert blue light from the photic zone or green bioluminescence in the aphotic zone into red light to aid vision.      |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis| .  Also, the proteins may fluctuate in number as more or less light becomes available as a means of photoacclimation.  Similarly, these fluorescent proteins may possess antioxidant capacities to eliminate oxygen radicals produced by photosynthesis.  Finally, through modulating photosynthesis, the fluorescent proteins may also serve as a means of regulating the activity of the corals photosynthetic algal symbionts.       |Cephalopods|Cephalopods| Alloteuthis subulata and Loligo vulgaris, two types of nearly transparent squid, have fluorescent spots above their eyes. These spots reflect incident light, which may serve as a means of camouflage, but also for signaling to other squids for schooling purposes.           Another, well-studied example of fluorescence in the ocean is the  |hydrozoan|Hydrozoan|   Aequorea victoria . This jellyfish lives in the photic zone off the west coast of North America and was identified as a carrier of  |green_fluorescent_protein|Green_Fluorescent_Protein|  by  |Osamu_Shimomura|Osamu_Shimomura| . The gene for these green fluorescent proteins has been isolated and is scientifically significant because it is widely used in genetic studies to indicate the expression of other genes.       |mantis_shrimp|Mantis_Shrimp| , which are stomatopod  |crustaceans|Crustaceans| , including Lysiosquillina glabriuscula, have yellow fluorescent markings along their antennal scales and  |carapace|Carapace|  that males present during threat displays to predators and other males. The display involves raising the head and thorax, spreading the striking appendages and other maxillipeds, and extending the prominent, oval antennal scales laterally, which makes the animal appear larger and accentuates its yellow fluorescent markings. Furthermore, as depth increases, mantis shrimp fluorescence accounts for a greater part of the visible light available. During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.       |Aphotic_zone|Aphotic_Zone|   Siphonophorae  is an order of marine animals from the phylum  |Hydrozoa|Hydrozoa|  that consist of a specialized  |medusoid|Jellyfish|  and  |polyp|Polyp| |zooid|Zooid| . Some siphonophores, including the genus Erenna that live in the aphotic zone between depths of 1600 m and 2300 m, exhibit yellow to red fluorescence in the  |photophores|Photophores|  of their tentacle-like  |tentilla|Tentilla| . This fluorescence occurs as a by-product of bioluminescence from these same photophores. The siphonophores exhibit the fluorescence in a flicking pattern that is used as a lure to attract prey.       |dragonfish|Barbeled_Dragonfish|  Malacosteus niger, the closely related genus  Aristostomias  and the species  Pachystomias microdon  use fluorescent red accessory pigments to convert the blue light emitted from their own bioluminescence to red light from suborbital  |photophores|Photophores| . This red luminescence is invisible to other animals, which allows these dragonfish extra light at dark ocean depths without attracting or signaling predators.          The  |Polka-dot_tree_frog|Polka-Dot_Tree_Frog| , widely found in the  |Amazon|Amazon_Rainforest|  was discovered to be the first fluorescent  |amphibian|Amphibian|  in 2017. The frog is pale green with dots in white, yellow or light red. The fluorescence of the frog was discovered unintentionally in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The fluorescence was traced to a new compound found in the  |lymph|Lymph|  and skin glads.  The main fluorescent compound is Hyloin-L1 and it gives a blue-green glow when exposed to violet or  |ultra_violet_light|Ultraviolet| . Scientists behind the discovery suggest that the fluorescence can be used for communication. They also think that about 100 or 200 species of frogs are likely to be fluorescent.         |Swallowtail|Swallowtail_Butterfly|   butterflies have complex systems for emitting fluorescent light. Their wings contain pigment-infused crystals that provide directed fluorescent light. These crystals function to produce fluorescent light best when they absorb  |radiance|Radiance|  from sky-blue light . The wavelengths of light that the butterflies see the best correspond to the absorbance of the crystals in the butterflys wings. This likely functions to enhance the capacity for signaling.         |Parrots|Parrots|  have fluorescent  |plumage|Plumage|  that may be used in mate signaling. A study using mate-choice experiments on  |budgerigars|Budgerigars|   found compelling support for fluorescent sexual signaling, with both males and females significantly preferring birds with the fluorescent experimental stimulus. This study suggests that the fluorescent plumage of parrots is not simply a by-product of  |pigmentation|Pigmentation| , but instead an adapted sexual signal. Considering the intricacies of the pathways that produce fluorescent pigments, there may be significant costs involved. Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they can deal with the associated costs.           Spiders fluoresce under UV light and possess a huge diversity of fluorophores. Remarkably, spiders are the only known group in which fluorescence is “taxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily labile, and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling . A study by Andrews et al. reveals that fluorescence has evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification. In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator-prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflaging with matching fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of fluorescence expression, depending upon whether fluorescence helps spiders be cryptic or makes them more conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of fluorescence across spider species.      Scorpions also fluorescent due to the presence of  |beta_carboline|Beta_Carboline|  in their cuticles.        The Mirabilis jalapa flower contains violet, fluorescent betacyanins and yellow, fluorescent betaxanthins. Under white light, parts of the flower containing only betaxanthins appear yellow, but in areas where both betaxanthins and betacyanins are present, the visible fluorescence of the flower is faded due to internal light-filtering mechanisms. Fluorescence was previously suggested to play a role in  |pollinator|Pollinator|  attraction, however, it was later found that the visual signal by fluorescence is negligible compared to the visual signal of light reflected by the flower.       |Chlorophyll|Chlorophyll|  is probably the most widely distributed fluorescent molecule, producing red emission under a reange of excitation wavelengths.              |Gemstones|Gemstone| ,  |minerals|Mineral| , may have a distinctive fluorescence or may fluoresce differently under short-wave ultraviolet, long-wave ultraviolet, visible light, or  |X-rays|X-Ray| .     Many types of  |calcite|Calcite|  and amber will fluoresce under shortwave UV, longwave UV and visible light.  |Rubies|Ruby| ,  |emeralds|Emerald| , and  |diamonds|Diamonds|  exhibit red fluorescence under long-wave UV, blue and sometimes green light; diamonds also emit light under  |X-ray|X-Ray|  radiation.     Fluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent  |manganese|Manganese| , in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of  |calcite|Calcite| , the green fluorescence of  |willemite|Willemite| , the yellow fluorescence of  |esperite|Esperite| , and the orange fluorescence of  |wollastonite|Wollastonite|  and  |clinohedrite|Clinohedrite| . Hexavalent  |uranium|Uranium| , in the form of the  |uranyl_cation|Uranyl_Cation| , fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as  |autunite|Autunite|  or  |andersonite|Andersonite| , and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of  |hyalite|Hyalite|  opal. Trivalent  |chromium|Chromium|  at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of  |ruby|Ruby| . Divalent  |europium|Europium|  is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral  |fluorite|Fluorite| . Trivalent  |lanthanides|Lanthanide|  such as  |terbium|Terbium|  and  |dysprosium|Dysprosium|  are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the  |yttrofluorite|Yttrofluorite|  variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of  |zircon|Zircon| .  |Powellite|Powellite|   and  |scheelite|Scheelite|  fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy  |tungsten|Tungsten|  to the lower-energy  |molybdenum|Molybdenum| , such that fairly low levels of  |molybdenum|Molybdenum|  are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for  |scheelite|Scheelite| , instead of blue. Low-iron  |sphalerite|Sphalerite|  , fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.     Crude oil  fluoresces in a range of colors, from dull-brown for heavy oils and tars through to bright-yellowish and bluish-white for very light oils and condensates. This phenomenon is used in  |oil_exploration|Oil_Exploration|  drilling to identify very small amounts of oil in drill cuttings and core samples.       Organic solutions such  |anthracene|Anthracene|  or  |stilbene|Stilbene| , dissolved in  |benzene|Benzene|  or  |toluene|Toluene| , fluoresce with  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  or  |gamma_ray|Gamma_Ray| |irradiation|Irradiation| . The decay times of this fluorescence are on the order of nanoseconds, since the duration of the light depends on the lifetime of the excited states of the fluorescent material, in this case anthracene or stilbene.       |Scintillation|Scintillation|  is defined a flash of light produced in a transparent material by the passage of a particle . Stilbene and derivatives are used in  |scintillation_counters|Scintillation_Counter|  to detect such particles. Stilbene is also one of the  |gain_mediums|Gain_Medium|  used in  |dye_lasers|Dye_Lasers| .       Fluorescence is observed in the atmosphere when the air is under energetic electron bombardment. In cases such as the natural  |aurora|Aurora| , high-altitude nuclear explosions, and rocket-borne electron gun experiments, the molecules and ions formed have a fluorescent response to light.           |Vitamin_B2|Vitamin_B2|  fluoresces yellow.    |Tonic_water|Tonic_Water|  fluoresces blue due to the presence of  |quinine|Quinine| .    |Highlighter|Highlighter|  ink is often fluorescent due to the presence of  |pyranine|Pyranine| .    |Banknotes|Banknote| ,  |postage_stamps|Postage_Stamp|  and  |credit_cards|Credit_Card|  often have fluorescent security features.               The common  |fluorescent_lamp|Fluorescent_Lamp|  relies on fluorescence. Inside the  |glass|Glass|  tube is a partial vacuum and a small amount of  |mercury|Mercury| . An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the  phosphor , which absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent  |lighting|Lighting|  is more energy-efficient than  |incandescent|Incandescent|  lighting elements. However, the uneven  |spectrum|Spectrum|  of traditional fluorescent lamps may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or  |daylight|Daylight| . The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254  nm , accompanied by visible light emission at 436  nm , 546  nm and 579  nm . These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many  |compact_fluorescent_lamp|Compact_Fluorescent_Lamp|  and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.      Fluorescent lights were first available to the public at the  |1939_New_York_Worlds_Fair|1939_New_York_Worlds_Fair| . Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes . Some  |high-intensity_discharge_lamps|High-Intensity_Discharge_Lamp|  couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.     White  |light-emitting_diodes|Light-Emitting_Diode|  became available in the mid-1990s as  |LED_lamps|Led_Lamp| , in which blue light emitted from the  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  strikes phosphors deposited on the tiny chip. The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light.      |Glow_sticks|Glow_Stick|  sometimes utilize fluorescent materials to absorb light from the  |chemiluminescent|Chemiluminescence|  reaction and emit light of a different color.       Many analytical procedures involve the use of a  |fluorometer|Fluorometer| , usually with a single exciting wavelength and single detection wavelength. Because of the sensitivity that the method affords, fluorescent molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion can be measured.      Fluorescence in several wavelengths can be detected by an  |array_detector|Chromatography_Detector| , to detect compounds from  |HPLC|High-Performance_Liquid_Chromatography|  flow. Also,  |TLC|Thin_Layer_Chromatography|  plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a  |Boltzmann_distribution|Boltzmann_Distribution| . There is, then, a higher probability of excitement and release of photons by lower-energy atoms, making analysis more efficient.          Usually the setup of a fluorescence assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength is required for proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to  |Stokes_shift|Stokes_Shift|  and various  |electron_transitions|Electron_Transition| . To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission  |monochromator|Monochromator| , and observed selectively by a detector.              Fluorescence in the life sciences is used generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysis of biological molecules by means of the fluorescent emission at a specific frequency where there is no background from the excitation light, as relatively few cellular components are naturally fluorescent .   In fact, a  |protein|Protein|  or other component can be labelled with an extrinsic  |fluorophore|Fluorophore| , a fluorescent  |dye|Dye|  that can be a small molecule, protein, or quantum dot, finding a large use in many biological applications.  |Lakowicz|Lakowicz| , p. xxvi     The quantification of a dye is done with a  |spectrofluorometer|Spectrofluorometer|  and finds additional applications in:       When scanning the fluorescence intensity across a plane one has  |fluorescence_microscopy|Fluorescence_Microscope|  of tissues, cells, or subcellular structures, which is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labelling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image . DNA microarrays are a variant of this.   Immunology: An antibody is first prepared by having a fluorescent chemical group attached, and the sites where the antibody has bound can be seen, and even quantified, by the fluorescence.   FLIM  can be used to detect certain bio-molecular interactions that manifest themselves by influencing fluorescence lifetimes.   Cell and molecular biology: detection of  |colocalization|Colocalization|  using fluorescence-labelled antibodies for selective detection of the antigens of interest using specialized software such as ImageJ.       FRET  is used to study protein interactions, detect specific nucleic acid sequences and used as biosensors, while fluorescence lifetime can give an additional layer of information.   Biotechnology:  |biosensors|Biosensors|  using fluorescence are being studied as possible  |Fluorescent_glucose_biosensors|Fluorescent_Glucose_Biosensors| .   Automated sequencing of  |DNA|Dna|  by the  |chain_termination_method|Chain_Termination_Method| ; each of four different chain terminating bases has its own specific fluorescent tag. As the labelled DNA molecules are separated, the fluorescent label is excited by a UV source, and the identity of the base terminating the molecule is identified by the wavelength of the emitted light.   FACS . One of several important  |cell_sorting|Cell_Sorting|  techniques used in the separation of different cell lines .   DNA detection: the compound  |ethidium_bromide|Ethidium_Bromide| , in aqueous solution, has very little fluorescence, as it is quenched by water. Ethidium bromides fluorescence is greatly enhanced after it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in  |agarose_gel_electrophoresis|Agarose_Gel_Electrophoresis| . Intercalated ethidium is in a hydrophobic environment when it is between the base pairs of the DNA, protected from quenching by water which is excluded from the local environment of the intercalated ethidium. Ethidium bromide may be carcinogenic – an arguably safer alternative is the dye  |SYBR_Green|Sybr_Green| .   FIGS  is a medical imaging technique that uses fluorescence to detect properly labeled structures during surgery.    |Intravascular_fluorescence|Intravascular_Fluorescence|  is a catheter-based medical imaging technique that uses fluorescence to detect high-risk features of atherosclerosis and unhealed vascular stent devices.  Plaque autofluorescence has been used in a first-in-man study in coronary arteries in combination with  |optical_coherence_tomography|Optical_Coherence_Tomography| .  Molecular agents has been also used to detect specific features, such as stent  |fibrin|Fibrin|  accumulation and enzymatic activity related to artery inflammation.    SAFI an imaging technique in  |electrokinetics|Electrokinetic_Phenomena|  and  |microfluidics|Microfluidics| .  It uses non-electromigrating dyes whose fluorescence is easily quenched by migrating chemical species of interest. The dye are usually seeded everywhere in the flow and differential quenching of their fluorescence by analytes is directly observed.   Fluorescence-based assays for screening  |toxic|Toxicity|  chemicals. The optical assays consist of a mixture of environmental-sensitive fluorescent dyes and human skin cells that generate fluorescence spectra patterns.  This approach can reduce the need for  |laboratory_animals|Animal_Testing|  in biomedical research and pharmaceutical industry.   Bone-margin detection:  |Alizarin-stained|Alizarin|  specimens and certain fossils can be lit by fluorescent lights to view anatomical structures, including bone margins.         |Fingerprints|Fingerprint|  can be visualized with fluorescent compounds such as  |ninhydrin|Ninhydrin|  or DFO . Blood and other substances are sometimes detected by fluorescent reagents, like  |fluorescein|Fluorescein| .  |Fibers|Fiber| , and other materials that may be encountered in  |forensics|Forensic_Science|  or with a relationship to various  |collectibles|Collectible| , are sometimes fluorescent.        |Fluorescent_penetrant_inspection|Fluorescent_Penetrant_Inspection|  is used to find cracks and other defects on the surface of a part.  |Dye_tracing|Dye_Tracing| , using fluorescent dyes, is used to find leaks in liquid and gas plumbing systems.       Fluorescent colors are frequently used in  |signage|Signage| , particularly road signs. Fluorescent colors are generally recognizable at longer ranges than their non-fluorescent counterparts, with fluorescent orange being particularly noticeable. Hawkins, H. Gene; Carlson, Paul John and Elmquist, Michael  , Texas Transportation Institute Report 2962-S. This property has led to its frequent use in safety signs and labels.          Fluorescent compounds are often used to enhance the appearance of fabric and paper, causing a whitening effect. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white. Optical brighteners are used in laundry detergents, high brightness paper, cosmetics,  |high-visibility_clothing|High-Visibility_Clothing|.
