Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the Harbour arm remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.
