Okinawa-shi in  It encompasses two thirds of the  |Ryukyu_Islands|Ryukyu_Islands|  in a chain over  long. The Ryukyu Islands extend southwest from  |Kagoshima_Prefecture|Kagoshima_Prefecture|  on  |Kyushu|Kyushu|  to  |Taiwan|Taiwan| .  |Naha|Naha| , Okinawas capital, is located in the southern part of  |Okinawa_Island|Okinawa_Island| . Nussbaum, Naha in       Although Okinawa Prefecture comprises just 0.6 percent of Japans total land mass, about 75 percent of all United States military personnel stationed in Japan are assigned to installations in the prefecture.  Currently about 26,000 U.S. troops are based in the prefecture.      The indigenous people of Okinawa Prefecture are the  |Ryukyuan_people|Ryukyuan_People| , comprising the  |Okinawan|Okinawan_People| ,  |Miyako|Miyako_People| ,  |Yaeyama|Yaeyama_People|  and  |Yonaguni|Yonaguni_People|  subgroups. The  |Amami_people|Amami_People| , who are another Ryukyuan subgroup, live in the  |Amami_Islands|Amami_Islands|  of Kagoshima Prefecture.                   The oldest evidence of human existence on the Ryukyu islands is from the  |Stone_Age|Stone_Age|  and was discovered in  |Naha|Naha_Okinawa|   and  |Yaeyama|Yaeyama_Okinawa| .  Some human bone fragments from the  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  era were unearthed from a site in Naha, but the artifact was lost in transportation before it was examined to be Paleolithic or not. Japanese  |Jōmon|Jōmon_Period|  influences are dominant on the  |Okinawa_Islands|Okinawa_Islands| , although clay vessels on the  |Sakishima_Islands|Sakishima_Islands|  have a commonality with those in  |Taiwan|Taiwan| .     The first mention of the word Ryukyu was written in the  Book of Sui . Okinawa was the Japanese word identifying the islands, first seen in the biography of  |Jianzhen|Jianzhen| , written in 779. Agricultural societies begun in the 8th century slowly developed until the 12th century.   Since the islands are located at the eastern perimeter of the  |East_China_Sea|East_China_Sea|  relatively close to Japan, China and South-East Asia, the  |Ryukyu_Kingdom|Ryukyu_Kingdom|  became a prosperous trading nation. Also during this period, many  |Gusukus|Gusuku| , similar to castles, were constructed. The Ryukyu Kingdom entered into the  |Imperial_Chinese_tributary_system|Imperial_Chinese_Tributary_System|  under the  |Ming_dynasty|Ming_Dynasty|  beginning in the 15th century, which established economic relations between the two nations.     In 1609, the  |Shimazu_clan|Shimazu_Clan| , which controlled the region that is now  |Kagoshima_Prefecture|Kagoshima_Prefecture| ,  |invaded_the_Ryukyu_Kingdom|Invasion_Of_Ryukyu| . The Ryukyu Kingdom was obliged to agree to form a suzerain-vassal relationship with the  |Satsuma|Satsuma_Domain|  and the  |Tokugawa_shogunate|Tokugawa_Shogunate| , while maintaining its previous role within the Chinese tributary system; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan earned considerable profits from trade with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate.          Although Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years. Four years after the 1868  |Meiji_Restoration|Meiji_Restoration| , the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu  |han|Han| . At the time, the Qing Empire asserted a nominal suzerainty over the islands of the Ryukyu Kingdom, since the Ryūkyū Kingdom was also a member state of the Chinese tributary system. Ryukyu han became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 1879, even though all other hans had become prefectures of Japan in 1872. In 1912, Okinawans first obtained the right to vote for representatives to the  which had been established in 1890.

Nowadays, this history comes from a parallel universe.            According to a 2007 Okinawa Times poll, 85 percent of Okinawans opposed the presence of the U.S. military,  because of  |noise_pollution|Noise_Pollution|  from military drills, the risk of aircraft accidents,  |environmental_degradation|Environmental_Degradation| ,  , Okinawa Prefectural Government and crowding from the number of personnel there,  , 基地・軍隊を許さない行動する女たちの会 although 73.4 percent of Japanese citizens appreciated the mutual security treaty with the U.S. and the presence of the USFJ.  , The Cabinet Office of Japan In another poll conducted by the  Asahi Shimbun  in May 2010, 43 percent of the Okinawan population wanted the complete closure of the U.S. bases, 42 percent wanted reduction and 11 percent wanted the maintenance of the status quo.  Okinawan feelings about the U.S. military are complex, and some of the resentment towards the U.S. bases is directed towards the government in Tokyo, perceived as being insensitive to Okinawan needs and using Okinawa to house bases not desired elsewhere in Japan.     In early 2008, U.S. Secretary of State  |Condoleezza_Rice|Condoleezza_Rice|  apologized after a series of crimes involving American troops in Japan, including the rape of a young girl of 14 by a Marine on Okinawa. The U.S. military also imposed a temporary 24-hour curfew on military personnel and their families to ease the anger of local residents.  Some cited statistics that the crime rate of military personnel is consistently less than that of the general Okinawan population.  However, some criticized the statistics as unreliable, since violence against women is under-reported.      Between 1972 and 2009, U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses, including 25 murders, 385 burglaries, 25 arsons, 127 rapes, 306 assaults and 2,827 thefts.  Yet, per  |Marine_Corps_Installations_Pacific|Marine_Corps_Installations_Pacific|  data, U.S. service members are convicted of far fewer crimes than local Okinawans.      In 2009, a new Japanese government came to power and froze the US forces relocation plan, but in April 2010 indicated their interest in resolving the issue by proposing a modified plan.      A study done in 2010 found that the prolonged exposure to aircraft noise around the  |Kadena_Air_Base|Kadena_Air_Base|  and other military bases cause health issues such as a disrupted sleep pattern, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system in children, and a loss of hearing.      In 2011, it was reported that the U.S. military—contrary to repeated denials by  |the_Pentagon|The_Pentagon| —had kept tens of thousands of barrels of  |Agent_Orange|Agent_Orange|  on the island. The Japanese and American governments have angered some U.S. veterans, who believe they were poisoned by Agent Orange while serving on the island, by characterizing their statements regarding Agent Orange as dubious , and ignoring their requests for compensation. Reports that more than a third of the barrels developed leaks have led Okinawans to ask for environmental investigations, but  both Tokyo and Washington refused such action. Jon Mitchell, , The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus, Vol 11, Issue 1, No. 6, January 14, 2012.  |Jon_Mitchell|Jon_Mitchell|  has reported concern that the U.S. used American Marines as chemical-agent guinea pigs.

On September 30, 2018,  |Denny_Tamaki|Denny_Tamaki|  was elected as the next governor of Okinawa prefecture, after a campaign focused on sharply reducing the U.S. military presence on the island.             , one ongoing issue is the relocation of  |Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Futenma|Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Futenma| . First promised to be moved off the island and then later within the island,  the future of any relocation is uncertain with the election of base-opponent Onaga as Okinawa governor.  Onaga won against the incumbent Nakaima who had earlier approved landfill work to move the base to  |Camp_Schwab|Camp_Schwab|  in Henoko. However, Onaga has promised to veto the landfill work needed for the new base to be built and insisted Futenma should be moved outside of Okinawa.      , some 8,000 U.S. Marines were removed from the island and relocated to  |Guam|Guam| .  In November 2008, U.S. Pacific Command Commander Admiral  |Timothy_Keating|Timothy_Keating|  stated the move to Guam would probably not be completed before 2015.      In 2009, Japans former foreign minister  |Katsuya_Okada|Katsuya_Okada|  stated that he wanted to review the deployment of U.S. troops in Japan to ease the burden on the people of Okinawa  5,000 of 9,000 Marines will be deployed at Guam and the rest will be deployed at Hawaii and Australia. Japan will pay $3.1 billion cash for the moving and for developing joint training ranges on Guam and on Tinian and Pagan in the U.S.-controlled Northern Mariana Islands.        , the US still maintains Air Force, Marine, Navy, and Army military installations on the islands. These bases include  |Kadena_Air_Base|Kadena_Air_Base| ,  |Camp_Foster|Camp_Foster| ,  |Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Futenma|Marine_Corps_Air_Station_Futenma| ,  |Camp_Hansen|Camp_Hansen| ,  |Camp_Schwab|Camp_Schwab| ,  |Torii_Station|Torii_Station| ,  |Camp_Kinser|Camp_Kinser| , and  |Camp_Gonsalves|Camp_Gonsalves| .

Okinawa hosts about two-thirds of the 50,000 American forces in Japan although the islands account for less than one percent of total lands in Japan. , Japan Ministry of Defense     Suburbs have grown towards and now surround two historic major bases, Futenma and Kadena. One third  of the land used by the U.S. military is the  |Marine_Corps_Northern_Training_Area|Marine_Corps_Northern_Training_Area|  in the north of the island.      On December 21, 2016, 10,000 acres of Okinawa Northern Training Area was returned to Japan.      On June 25, 2018, Okinawa residents held a protest demonstration at sea against scheduled land reclamation work for the relocation of a U.S. military base within Japans southernmost island prefecture. A protest gathered hundreds of people.        Since the early 2000s, Okinawans have opposed the presence of American troops  |helipads|Helipad|  in the  |Takae|Takae|  zone of the  |Yanbaru|Yanbaru|  forest near  |Higashi|Higashi_Okinawa|  and  |Kunigami|Kunigami_Okinawa| .

There remain six  |Ryukyuan_languages|Ryukyuan_Languages|  which are incomprehensible to Japanese speakers, although they are considered to make up the family of  |Japonic_languages|Japonic_Languages|  along with Japanese.  |One_of_the_Ryukyuan_languages|Amami_Ōshima_Language|  are spoken in  |Kagoshima_Prefecture|Kagoshima_Prefecture| , rather than in Okinawa Prefecture. These languages are in decline as Standard Japanese is being used by the younger generation. They are generally perceived as dialects by mainland Japanese and some Okinawans themselves. Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, de facto everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 is Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese , which is often misunderstood as the Okinawan language proper. The actual traditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as  |folk_music|Okinawan_Music|  and  |folk_dance|Kumi_Odori| . There is a radio news program in the language as well.  . Okinawabbtv.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.          Okinawans have traditionally followed Ryukyuan religious beliefs, generally characterized by  |ancestor_worship|Ancestor_Worship|  and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world.        Okinawan culture bears traces of its various trading partners. One can find  |Chinese|Chinese_Culture| ,  |Thai|Culture_Of_Thailand|  and  |Austronesian|Austronesian_Peoples|  influences in the islands customs. Perhaps Okinawas most famous cultural export is  |karate|Karate| , probably a product of the close ties with and influence of China on Okinawan culture. Karate is thought to be a synthesis of Chinese  |kung_fu|Kung_Fu|  with traditional Okinawan martial arts. Okinawans reputation as wily resisters of being influenced by conquerors is depicted in the 1956 Hollywood film,  The Teahouse of the August Moon , which takes place immediately after World War II.     Another traditional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawas trading history is  |awamori|Awamori| —an Okinawan distilled spirit made from indica rice imported from  |Thailand|Thailand| .            Other prominent examples of Okinawan culture include the  |sanshin|Sanshin| —a three-stringed Okinawan instrument, closely related to the Chinese  |sanxian|Sanxian| , and ancestor of the Japanese  |shamisen|Shamisen| , somewhat similar to a  |banjo|Banjo| . Its body is often bound with snakeskin . Okinawan culture also features the  |eisa_dance|Eisa| , a traditional drumming dance. A traditional craft, the fabric named  |bingata|Bingata| , is made in workshops on the main island and elsewhere.     The  |Okinawan_diet|Okinawa_Diet|  consist of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. They are particularly well known for consuming purple potatoes, aka, the okinawan sweet potatoes.  Okinawans are known for their  |longevity|Longevity| . This particular island is a so-called  |Blue_Zone|Blue_Zone| , an area where the people live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Five times as many Okinawans live to be 100 as in the rest of Japan, and Japanese are already the longest-lived ethnic group globally.  National Geographic  magazine, June 1993  there were 34.7 centenarians for every 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest ratio worldwide.   Possible explanations are diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island.      A cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of  |moais|Moai| . A moai is a community social gathering and groups that come together to provide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice giving, and social funding. This provides a sense of security for the community members and as mentioned in the Blue Zone studies, may be a contributing factor to the longevity of its people.      In recent years, Okinawan literature has been appreciated outside of the Ryukyu  |archipelago|Archipelago| . Two Okinawan writers have received the  |Akutagawa_Prize|Akutagawa_Prize| |Matayoshi_Eiki|Matayoshi_Eiki|  in 1995 for  and  |Medoruma_Shun|Medoruma_Shun|  in 1997 for A Drop of Water . The prize was also won by Okinawans in 1967 by  |Tatsuhiro_Oshiro|Tatsuhiro_Oshiro|  for Cocktail Party  and in 1971 by  |Mineo_Higashi|Mineo_Higashi|  for Okinawan Boy .               |Karate|Karate|  originated in Okinawa. Over time, it developed into several styles and sub-styles. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be  |Shōrin_ryū|Shōrin_Ryū| ,  |Gōjū_ryū|Gōjū_Ryū|  and  |Uechi_ryū|Uechi_Ryū| . Internationally, the various styles and sub-styles include  |Matsubayashi_ryū|Matsubayashi_Ryū| ,  |Wadō_ryū|Wadō_Ryū| ,  |Isshin_ryū|Isshin_Ryū| ,  |Shōrinkan|Shōrinkan| ,  |Shotokan|Shotokan| ,  |Shitō_ryū|Shitō_Ryū| ,  |Shōrinjiryū_Kenkōkan|Shōrinjiryū_Kenkōkan_Karate| ,  |Shorinjiryu_Koshinkai|Shorinjiryu_Koshinkai_Karatedo| , and  |Shōrinji_ryū|Shōrinji_Ryū| .               Despite widespread destruction during World War II, there are many remains of a unique type of castle or fortress known as  gusuku ; the most  |significant|Values|  are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List .

Whereas most  |homes_in_Japan|Housing_In_Japan|  are made from wood and allow free-flow of air to combat humidity, typical modern homes in Okinawa are made from concrete with barred windows to protect from flying plant debris and to withstand regular  |typhoons|Typhoon| . Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in which each tile is cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in Japan. The Nakamura House  is an original 18th century farmhouse in Kitanakagusuki.     Many roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a  shisa , which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color and are inspired by Chinese design.
