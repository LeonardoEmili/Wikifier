Alcindor played on the UCLA freshman team in 1966 only because the freshman rule was in effect, but his prowess was already well known.  He received national coverage when he made his varsity debut in 1967: Sports Illustrated described him as The New Superstar.  From 1967 to 1969, he played on the varsity under head coach  |John_Wooden|John_Wooden| . He was the main contributor to the teams three-year record of 88 wins and only two losses: one to the  |University_of_Houston|1967–68_Houston_Cougars_Mens_Basketball_Team|  in which Alcindor had an eye injury, and the other to crosstown rival  |USC|Usc_Trojans_Mens_Basketball|  who played a stall game .

Alcindor scored 31 points and had 21 rebounds in what was a good indication of things to come. After the game, the UCLA varsity was 1 in the country but 2 on campus. If the freshman rule had not been in effect at that time, UCLA would have had a much better chance of winning the 1966 National Championship.     Alcindor had considered transferring to  |Michigan|Michigan_Wolverines_Mens_Basketball|  because of unfulfilled recruiting promises. UCLA player  |Willie_Naulls|Willie_Naulls|  introduced Alcindor and teammate  |Lucius_Allen|Lucius_Allen|  to athletic booster  |Sam_Gilbert|Sam_Gilbert| , who convinced the pair to remain at UCLA.      The  |dunk|Slam_Dunk|  was banned in college basketball after the 1967 season, primarily because of Alcindors dominant use of the shot. . Time Magazine, April 14, 1967. Quote: First there was the Wilt Chamberlain Rule, designed to force him away from the basket by widening the 3-sec. zone, in which an offensive player can remain for only 3  sec. at a time. Next came the Bill Russell Rule, which forbids blocking a shot when the ball is on its downward course. Now there is the Lew Alcindor Rule. College basketballs rules makers decided last week that players may no longer dunk or stuff the ball by ramming it through the hoop from directly above. The rule was not rescinded until the 1976–77 season, which was shortly after Woodens retirement.     During his junior year, Alcindor suffered a scratched left  |cornea|Cornea|  on January 12, 1968, in a game against Cal when he was struck by Tom Henderson in a rebound battle.  He would miss the next two games against Stanford and Portland. This happened right before the showdown game against Houston.

Alcindors decision to stay home during the 1968 Games was in protest of the unequal treatment of  |African-Americans|African-Americans|  in the United States.     Alcindor was one of only four players who started on three NCAA championship teams; the others all played for Wooden at UCLA:  |Henry_Bibby|Henry_Bibby| ,  |Curtis_Rowe|Curtis_Rowe|  and  |Lynn_Shackelford|Lynn_Shackelford| .

The Bruins 47-game winning streak ended in what has been called the  |Game_of_the_Century|Game_Of_The_Century|  . Hayes and Alcindor had a rematch in the semi-finals of the  |NCAA_Tournament|1968_Ncaa_Mens_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament| , where UCLA, with a healthy Alcindor, defeated Houston 101–69 en route to the national championship. UCLA limited Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game, to only ten points. Wooden credited his assistant,  |Jerry_Norman|Jerry_Norman| , for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes.

The  |Harlem_Globetrotters|Harlem_Globetrotters|  offered Alcindor $1 million to play for them, but he declined and was picked first in the  |1969_NBA_draft|1969_Nba_Draft|  by the  |Milwaukee_Bucks|1969–70_Milwaukee_Bucks_Season| , who were in only their second season of existence. The Bucks won a coin-toss with the  |Phoenix_Suns|1969–70_Phoenix_Suns_Season|  for first pick. He was also chosen first overall in the 1969  |American_Basketball_Association|American_Basketball_Association|  draft by the  |New_York_Nets|1969–70_New_York_Nets_Season| .  The Nets believed that they had the upper hand in securing Alcindors services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept one offer only from each team, the Nets bid too low. Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge. . Sports Illustrated, April 7, 1969 After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying, A bidding war degrades the people involved. It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I dont want to think like that.      Alcindors presence enabled the  |1969–70_Bucks|1969–70_Milwaukee_Bucks_Season|  to claim second place in the NBAs Eastern Division with a 56–26 record . Alcindor was an instant star, ranking second in the league in scoring  and third in rebounding , for which he was awarded the title of  |NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year|Nba_Rookie_Of_The_Year_Award| . Until  |Jayson_Tatum|Jayson_Tatum|  in 2018, Alcindor would be the only rookie to record 10 or more games of 20+ points scored during the playoffs.     The next season, the Bucks acquired All-Star guard  |Oscar_Robertson|Oscar_Robertson| . Milwaukee went on to record the  |best_record_in_the_league|List_Of_Nba_Teams_By_Single_Season_Win_Percentage|  with 66 victories in the  |1970–71_season|1970–71_Nba_Season| , including a then-record  |20_straight_wins|List_Of_National_Basketball_Association_Longest_Winning_Streaks| . Alcindor was awarded his first of six  |NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Awards|Nba_Most_Valuable_Player_Award| , along with his first scoring title . He also led the league in total points, with 2,596. In the playoffs, the Bucks went 12–2 , and won the championship, while Alcindor was named  |Finals_MVP|Bill_Russell_Nba_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award| . On May 1, 1971, the day after the Bucks won the NBA championship, he adopted the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , its translation roughly noble one, servant of the Almighty i.e., servant of  |Allah|Allah|  . He had converted to Islam while at UCLA.        Abdul-Jabbar remained a dominant force for the Bucks. The following year, he repeated as scoring champion with  and was named NBA Most Valuable Player. He helped the Bucks to repeat as division leaders for four straight years. In 1974, Abdul-Jabbar won his third MVP Award in five years and was among the top five NBA players in scoring , rebounding , blocked shots , and field goal percentage .     Abdul-Jabbar remained relatively injury-free throughout his NBA career, but he twice broke one of his hands. The first incident occurred during a pre-season game in 1974, when he was bumped hard and got his eye scratched; this angered him enough to punch the basket support  |stanchion|Wiktionary:Stanchion| . He returned after missing the first 16 games of the season and started to wear protective goggles. In the second incident, he broke his hand during the opening game of the  |1977–78_season|1977–78_Nba_Season| . Two minutes into the game, Abdul-Jabbar punched  |Milwaukees|1977–78_Milwaukee_Bucks_Season| |Kent_Benson|Kent_Benson|  in retaliation for an overly aggressive elbow; the punch caused Bensons jaw to be broken.  As a result of the injury to his hand, Abdul-Jabbar was out for two months, and it was unnecessary for the NBA to suspend him.      Although Abdul-Jabbar always spoke well of  |Milwaukee|Milwaukee|  and its fans, he said that being in the Midwest did not fit his cultural needs. In October 1974, he requested a trade to either the New York Knicks or  |Los_Angeles|1974–75_Los_Angeles_Lakers_Season| .          In 1975, the Lakers acquired Abdul-Jabbar and reserve center  |Walt_Wesley|Walt_Wesley|  from the Bucks for center  |Elmore_Smith|Elmore_Smith| , guard  |Brian_Winters|Brian_Winters| , and rookie blue chippers  |Dave_Meyers|David_Meyers|  and  |Junior_Bridgeman|Junior_Bridgeman| . In the  |1975–76_season|1975–76_Nba_Season| , his first with the Lakers, he had a dominating season, averaging 27.7 points per game and leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. His 1,111 defensive rebounds remains the NBA single-season record .  He earned his fourth MVP award, but missed the post-season for the second straight year.        Once he joined the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his trademark goggles . Years of battling under NBA backboards, and being hit and scratched in the face in the process, had taken their toll on his eyes and he developed  |corneal_erosion_syndrome|Recurrent_Corneal_Erosion| , where the eyes begin to dry out easily and cease to produce moisture. He missed one game in the  |1986–87_season|1986–87_Nba_Season|  when his eyes dried out and swelled.     In the  |1976–77_season|1976–77_Nba_Season| , Abdul-Jabbar had another strong performance. He led the league in field goal percentage, finished second in rebounds and blocked shots, and third in points per game. He helped lead the Lakers to the best record in the NBA, and he won his record-tying fifth MVP award. In the playoffs, the Lakers beat the  |Golden_State_Warriors|1976–77_Golden_State_Warriors_Season|  in the Western Conference semi-finals, setting up a confrontation with the  |Portland_Trail_Blazers|1976–77_Portland_Trail_Blazers_Season| . The result was a memorable matchup, pitting Abdul-Jabbar against a young, injury-free  |Bill_Walton|Bill_Walton| . Although Abdul-Jabbar dominated the series statistically, Walton and the Trail Blazers swept the Lakers, behind Waltons skillful passing and leadership.     Abdul-Jabbars play remained strong during the next two seasons, being named to the All-NBA Second Team twice, the All-Defense First Team once, and the All-Defense Second Team once. The Lakers, however, continued to be stymied in the playoffs, being eliminated by the  |Seattle_SuperSonics|Seattle_Supersonics|  in both  |1978|1977–78_Nba_Season|  and  |1979|1978–79_Nba_Season| .     In 1979, the Lakers acquired first overall draft pick  |Magic_Johnson|Magic_Johnson| . The trade and draft paved the way for a Laker dynasty as they went on to become the most dominant team of the 1980s, appearing in the finals eight times and winning five NBA championships. Individually, while Abdul-Jabbar was not the dominant center he had been in the 1970s, he experienced a number of highlight moments. Among them were his record sixth MVP award in 1980, four more All-NBA First Team designations, two more All-Defense First Team designations, the 1985 Finals MVP, and on April 5, 1984 breaking Wilt Chamberlains record for most career points. Later in his career, he bulked up to about , to be able to withstand the strain of playing the highly physical center position into his early 40s.        While in Los Angeles, Abdul-Jabbar started doing  |yoga|Yoga|  in 1976 to improve his flexibility, and was notable for his physical fitness regimen.  He says, There is no way I could have played as long as I did without yoga.      In 1983, Abdul-Jabbars house burned down. Many of his belongings, including his beloved  |jazz|Jazz_Music|  LP collection of about 3,000 albums, were destroyed.  Many Lakers fans sent and brought him albums, which he found uplifting.      On June 28, 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was 42 years old when he announced that he would retire at the end of the season after twenty years in the NBA. On his retirement tour he received standing ovations at games, home and away and gifts ranging from a yacht that said Captain Skyhook to framed jerseys from his basketball career to an Afghan rug. In his biography My Life,  |Magic_Johnson|Magic_Johnson|  recalls that many Lakers and Celtics legends participated in Abdul-Jabbars farewell game. Every player wore Abdul-Jabbars trademark goggles and had to try a skyhook at least once, which led to comic results. The Lakers made the NBA Finals in each of Abdul-Jabbars final three seasons, defeating  |Boston|1986–87_Boston_Celtics_Season|  in 1987, and  |Detroit|1987–88_Detroit_Pistons_Season|  in 1988. The Lakers lost to the Pistons in a four-game sweep in his final season.     At the time of his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar held the record for most games played by a single player in the NBA; this would later be broken by  |Robert_Parish|Robert_Parish| . He also was the all-time record holder for most points , most field goals made , and most minutes played .       Since 2005, Abdul-Jabbar has served as a special assistant coach for the Lakers. He had been interested in coaching since his retirement, and given the influence that he exerted on the league during his playing days, he thought that the opportunity would present itself. However, during his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation for being introverted and sullen. He did not speak to the press, which led to the impression that he disliked journalists. In his biography My Life,  |Magic_Johnson|Magic_Johnson|  recalls instances when Abdul-Jabbar brushed him off when he was a  |ball_boy|Ball_Boy|  and asked him for an autograph. Abdul-Jabbar also froze out reporters who gave him a too-enthusiastic handshake or even hugged him, and he refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview.     Abdul-Jabbar believes that his reticence, whether through disdain for the press or simply because of introversion, contributed to the dearth of coaching opportunities offered to him by the NBA. In his words, he said he had a mindset he could not overcome, and proceeded through his career oblivious to the effect his reticence may have had on his future coaching prospects. Abdul-Jabbar said: I didnt understand that I also had affected people that way and thats what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it. Since he began lobbying for a coaching position in 1995, he has managed to obtain only low-level assistant and scouting jobs in the NBA, and a head coaching position only in a minor professional league.     Abdul-Jabbar has worked as an assistant for the  |Los_Angeles_Clippers|Los_Angeles_Clippers|  and the  |Seattle_SuperSonics|Seattle_Supersonics| , helping mentor, among others, their young centers,  |Michael_Olowokandi|Michael_Olowokandi|  and  |Jerome_James|Jerome_James| . Abdul-Jabbar was the head coach of the  |Oklahoma_Storm|Oklahoma_Storm|  of the  |United_States_Basketball_League|United_States_Basketball_League|  in 2002, leading the team to the leagues championship that season, but he failed to land the head coaching position at  |Columbia_University|Columbia_University|  a year later.  He then worked as a  |scout|Scout|  for the  |New_York_Knicks|New_York_Knicks| .  Finally, on September 2, 2005, he returned to the Lakers as a special assistant to  |Phil_Jackson|Phil_Jackson|  to help the Lakers centers, and in particular their young draftee  |Andrew_Bynum|Andrew_Bynum| .  Abdul-Jabbars influence has been credited with Bynums emergence as a more talented NBA center. Abdul-Jabbar also served as a volunteer coach at Alchesay High School on the  |Fort_Apache_Indian_Reservation|Fort_Apache_Indian_Reservation|  in  |Whiteriver,_Arizona|Whiteriver,_Arizona|  in 1998.      In 2016, he performed a tribute to friend  |Muhammad_Ali|Muhammad_Ali|  along with  |Chance_the_Rapper|Chance_The_Rapper| .  He is also co-author of a comic book published by  |Titan_Comics|Titan_Comics|  entitled Mycroft Holmes and the Apocalypse Handbook.       On offense, Abdul-Jabbar was a dominant low-post threat. In contrast to other low-post specialists like  |Wilt_Chamberlain|Wilt_Chamberlain| ,  |Artis_Gilmore|Artis_Gilmore|  or  |Shaquille_ONeal|Shaquille_Oneal| , Abdul-Jabbar was a relatively slender player, standing  tall but only weighing  .  However, he made up for his relative lack of bulk by showing textbook finesse, strength and was famous for his ambidextrous  |skyhook|Hook_Shot|  shot, which was impossible for defenders to block. It contributed to his high .559 field goal accuracy, making him the eighth most accurate scorer of all time  and a feared clutch shooter. Abdul-Jabbar was also quick enough to run the  |Showtime|Showtime|  fast break led by  |Magic_Johnson|Magic_Johnson|  and was well-conditioned, standing on the hardwood an average 36.8 minutes. In contrast to other big men, Abdul-Jabbar also could reasonably hit his free throws, finishing with a career 72% average.     Abdul-Jabbar maintained a dominant presence on defense. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Team eleven times. He frustrated opponents with his superior shot-blocking ability and denied an average of 2.6 shots a game. After the pounding he endured early in his career, his rebounding average fell to between six or eight a game in his latter years.     As a teammate, Abdul-Jabbar exuded natural leadership and was affectionately called Cap  or Captain by his colleagues. He had an even temperament, which Riley said made him coachable.  A strict fitness regime made him one of the most durable players of all time. In the NBA, his 20 seasons and 1,560 games are performances surpassed only by former Celtics center  |Robert_Parish|Robert_Parish| .       Abdul-Jabbar was well known for his trademark skyhook , a  |hook_shot|Hook_Shot|  in which he bent his entire body like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arms arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height——the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without committing a  |goaltending|Goaltending|  violation. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him even more difficult to defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the  |Mikan_Drill|Mikan_Drill|  and soon learned to value it, as it was the only shot I could use that didnt get smashed back in my face .        Abdul-Jabbar is the NBAs all-time leading scorer with 38,387 points, and he won a league-record six MVP awards.  He earned six championship rings, two Finals MVP awards, fifteen NBA First or Second Teams, a record nineteen NBA All-Star call-ups and averaging 24.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 2.6 blocks per game. He is ranked as the NBAs third leading all-time rebounder .  He is also the third all-time in registered blocks ,  which is even more impressive because this stat had not been recorded until the fourth year of his career .

Abdul-Jabbar combined dominance during his career peak with the longevity and sustained excellence of his later years. He credited  |Bruce_Lee|Bruce_Lee|  with teaching him the discipline and spirituality of martial arts, which was greatly responsible for me being able to play competitively in the NBA for 20 years with very few injuries. . The Hollywood Reporter. August 16, 2019. After claiming his sixth and final MVP in 1980, Abdul-Jabbar continued to average above 20 points in the following six seasons, including 23 points per game in his 17th season at age 38. He made the NBAs  |35th_Anniversary_Team|Nba_35Th_Anniversary_Team| , and was named one of its  |50_greatest_players_of_all_time|50_Greatest_Players_In_Nba_History|  in 1996.
