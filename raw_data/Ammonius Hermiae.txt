Ammonius Hermiae  was a  |Greek|Byzantine_Empire| |philosopher|Philosopher| , and the son of the  |Neoplatonist|Neoplatonist|  philosophers  |Hermias|Hermias|  and  |Aedesia|Aedesia| . He was a pupil of  |Proclus|Proclus|  in  |Athens|Athens| , and taught at  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  for most of his life, writing commentaries on  |Plato|Plato| ,  |Aristotle|Aristotle| , and other philosophers.       Ammonius father,  |Hermias|Hermias| , died when he was a child, and his mother, Aedesia, raised him and his brother,  |Heliodorus|Heliodorus_Of_Alexandria| , in  |Alexandria|Alexandria| . When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to  |Athens|Athens|  where they studied under  |Proclus|Proclus| . Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on  |Plato|Plato|  and  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  for the rest of his life. According to  |Damascius|Damascius| , during the persecution of the  |pagans|Paganism|  at Alexandria in the late 480s, Ammonius made concessions to the  |Christian|Christianity|  authorities so that he could continue his lectures. Damascius, Philosophos Historia, 118B, Athanassiadi Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515;  |Olympiodorus|Olympiodorus_The_Younger|  heard him lecture on  |Platos|Plato|  Gorgias in that year. Olympiodorus, in Gorgias, 199, 8–10 He also taught  |Asclepius_of_Tralles|Asclepius_Of_Tralles| ,  |John_Philoponus|John_Philoponus| ,  |Damascius|Damascius|  and  |Simplicius|Simplicius_Of_Cilicia| .    He was also an accomplished  |astronomer|Astronomer| ; he lectured on  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  and is known to have written a treatise on the  |astrolabe|Astrolabe| .          Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotles De Interpretatione survives intact. A commentary on  |Porphyrys|Porphyry|   Isagoge  may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.     In De Interpretatione, Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like    |Boëthius|Boethius|  in his second Commentary and  The Consolation of Philosophy , this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites  |Iamblichus|Iamblichus|  who said knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known.   Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition, Curzon Press, John Inglis, 2002, pg. 128.     In addition, there are some notes of Ammonius lectures written by various students which also survive:     On Aristotles Categories   On Aristotles Prior Analytics I   On Aristotles Metaphysics 1–7    On  |Nicomachus|Nicomachus|  Introduction to Arithmetic   On Aristotles Prior Analytics    On Aristotles Posterior Analytics   On Aristotles On Generation and Corruption   On Aristotles On the Soul     There is Greek-language work called Life of Aristotle, which is usually ascribed to Ammonius, but is more probable that it is the work of  |Joannes_Philoponus|Joannes_Philoponus| , the pupil of Ammonius, to whom it is ascribed in some  |MSS|Manuscript| .  |Society_for_the_Diffusion_of_Useful_Knowledge|Society_For_The_Diffusion_Of_Useful_Knowledge| , , Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1843, p. 487.
