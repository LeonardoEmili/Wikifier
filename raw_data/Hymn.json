Watts , whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts first hymn, Behold the glories of the Lamb .    Found in few hymnals today, the hymn has eight stanzas in common meter and is based on Revelation 5:6, 8, 9, 10, 12.      Relying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called the father of English hymnody , but Erik Routley sees him more as the liberator of English hymnody , because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.

Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.     The meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as 87.87.87 , which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long meter, which is 88.88 ; S.M. is short meter ; C.M. is common metre , while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.
