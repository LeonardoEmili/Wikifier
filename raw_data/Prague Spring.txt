                The Prague Spring  was a period of political  |liberalization|Liberalization|  and mass protest in    |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic|  as a  |Communist_state|Communist_State|  after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . It began on 5 January 1968, when  |reformist|Reformist| |_Alexander_Dubček|Alexander_Dubček|  was elected  |First_Secretary|Secretary|  of the  |Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia|Communist_Party_Of_Czechoslovakia|  , and continued until 21 August 1968, when the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and other members of the  |Warsaw_Pact|Warsaw_Pact| |_invaded_the_country|Warsaw_Pact_Invasion_Of_Czechoslovakia|  to suppress the reforms.     The  |Prague|Prague|  Spring reforms were a strong attempt by Dubček to grant additional  |rights|Rights|  to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial  |decentralization_of_the_economy|Decentralization_Of_The_Economy|  and  |democratization|Democratization| . The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the  |media|Freedom_Of_The_Press| ,  |speech|Freedom_Of_Speech|  and  |travel|Freedom_Of_Movement| . After national discussion of dividing the country into a  |federation|Federation|  of three  |republics|Republic| ,  |Bohemia|Bohemia| ,  |Moravia_Silesia|Moravia_Silesia|  and  |Slovakia|Slovakia| , Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic. Czech radio broadcasts 18–20 August 1968 This dual federation was the only formal change that survived the invasion.     The reforms, especially the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country.  The New York Times  cited reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue.  A large wave of emigration swept the nation. Resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted  |fraternization|Fraternization| , sabotage of street signs, defiance of curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country, the resistance held out for eight months until it was finally circumvented by diplomatic maneuvers . It became a high-profile example of  |civilian_based_defense|Civilian_Based_Defense| ; there were sporadic acts of violence and several protest suicides by  |self_immolation|Self_Immolation|  , but no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained controlled by the Soviet Union until 1989, when the  |Velvet_Revolution|Velvet_Revolution|  peacefully ended the communist regime; the last Soviet troops left the country in 1991.     After the invasion, Czechoslovakia entered a period known as  |normalization|Normalization|  : subsequent leaders attempted to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the KSČ.  |Gustáv_Husák|Gustáv_Husák| , who replaced Dubček as First Secretary and also became  |President|President_Of_Czechoslovakia| , reversed almost all of the reforms. The Prague Spring inspired music and literature including the work of  |Václav_Havel|Václav_Havel| ,  |Karel_Husa|Karel_Husa| ,  |Karel_Kryl|Karel_Kryl|  and  |Milan_Kunderas|Milan_Kundera|  novel  The Unbearable Lightness of Being .            The process of  |de_Stalinization|De_Stalinization|  in  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  had begun under  |Antonín_Novotný|Antonín_Novotný|  in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the  |Eastern_Bloc|Eastern_Bloc| . Williams , p. 170 Following the lead of  |Nikita_Khrushchev|Nikita_Khrushchev| , Novotný proclaimed the completion of socialism, and the  |new_constitution|1960_Constitution_Of_Czechoslovakia|  Williams , p. 7 accordingly adopted the name  |Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic|Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic| . The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the  |Slánský_trials|Slánský_Trials| , may have been considered as early as 1963, but did not take place until 1967. Skilling , p. 47      |In_the_early_1960s|Czechoslovakia_1948_1968| , Czechoslovakia underwent an economic downturn.  The  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  model of industrialization applied poorly to Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was already quite industrialized before World War II and the Soviet model mainly took into account less developed economies. Novotnýs attempt at restructuring the economy, the 1965 New Economic Model, spurred increased demand for political reform as well. Williams , p. 5       In May 1963, Communist Marxists organized the Liblice conference that discussed Franz Kafkas life, marking the beginning of the cultural democratization of Czechoslovakia which ultimately led to the 1968 Prague Spring, an era of political liberalization. This conference was unique because it symbolizes  |Kafka|Franz_Kafka| ’s rehabilitation in the socialist world after having been largely criticized, led to a partial opening up of the regime and influenced the relaxation of censorship in communist countries. It also had an international impact as a representative from all Eastern European countries were invited to the Liblice Conference; only the Soviet Union did not send any representative. This conference had a revolutionary effect and paved the way for  |Dubcek|Alexander_Dubček|  reforms while making Kafka the symbol of the renaissance of Czech artistic and intellectual freedom.        As the strict regime eased its rules, the Union of Czechoslovak Writers cautiously began to air discontent, and in the unions gazette, , members suggested that literature should be independent of Party doctrine.     In June 1967, a small fraction of the Czech writers union sympathized with radical socialists, specifically  |Ludvík_Vaculík|Ludvík_Vaculík| ,  |Milan_Kundera|Milan_Kundera| ,  |Jan_Procházka|Jan_Procházka| ,  |Antonín_Jaroslav_Liehm|Antonín_Jaroslav_Liehm| ,  |Pavel_Kohout|Pavel_Kohout|  and  |Ivan_Klíma|Ivan_Klíma| .     A few months later, at a party meeting, it was decided that administrative actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only a small part of the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves. Williams , p. 55            As President Antonín Novotný was losing support,  |Alexander_Dubček|Alexander_Dubček| , First Secretary of the regional  |Communist_Party_of_Slovakia|Communist_Party_Of_Slovakia| , and economist  |Ota_Šik|Ota_Šik|  challenged him at a meeting of the Central Committee. Novotný then invited the secretary-general of the  |Communist_Party_of_Soviet_Union|Communist_Party_Of_Soviet_Union| ,  |Leonid_Brezhnev|Leonid_Brezhnev| , to  |Prague|Prague|  that December, seeking support; Navrátil , pp. 18–20 but Brezhnev was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakias leader. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968. Navazelskis On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by  |Ludvík_Svoboda|Ludvík_Svoboda| , who later gave consent to the reforms.      Early signs of change were few. When the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Presidium member  |Josef_Smrkovský|Josef_Smrkovský|  was interviewed in a  Rudé Právo  article, entitled What Lies Ahead , he insisted that Dubčeks appointment at the January Plenum would further the goals of socialism and maintain the working class nature of the Communist Party. Navrátil , p. 46       However, right after Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became chairman of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, Williams, p. 68  which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstücker tested the boundaries of Dubčeks devotion to freedom of the press when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotnys previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia. Williams, p 69     Despite the official government statement that allowed for freedom of the press, this was the first trial of whether Dubček was serious about reforms. Goldstücker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journals name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy. By August 1968, Literární listy had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe. Holý, Jiří. Writers Under Siege: Czech Literature Since 1945. Sussex: Sussex Academic Press, 2011, p. 119               On the 20th anniversary of Czechoslovakias  |Victorious_February|Czechoslovak_Coup_Détat_Of_1948|  , Dubček delivered a speech explaining the need for change following the triumph of socialism. He emphasized the need to enforce the leading role of the party more effectively and acknowledged that, despite  |Klement_Gottwalds|Klement_Gottwald|  urgings for better relations with society, the Party had too often made heavy-handed rulings on trivial issues. Dubček declared the partys mission was to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations  ...  a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the experience of other communist parties  ... Navrátil , pp. 52–54     One of the most important steps towards the reform was the reduction and later abolition of the  |censorship|Censorship|  on 4 March 1968. It was for the first time in Czech history the censorship was abolished and it was also probably the only reform fully implemented, although only for a short period. Changing from an instrument of party propaganda, media quickly became the instrument of criticism of the regime.       In April, Dubček launched an  |Action_Programme|Action_Programme|  of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on  |consumer_goods|Consumer_Goods|  and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy. Ello , pp. 32, 54 It would limit the power of the secret police  and provide for the  |federalization|Constitutional_Law_Of_Federation|  of the ČSSR into two equal nations. Hochman, Dubček The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and other  |Eastern_Bloc|Eastern_Bloc|  nations.  It spoke of a ten-year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of democratic socialism would replace the status quo. Judt , p. 441     Those who drafted the Action Programme were careful not to criticize the actions of the post-war Communist regime, only to point out policies that they felt had outlived their usefulness. For instance, the immediate post-war situation had required centralist and directive-administrative methods to fight against the remnants of the  |bourgeoisie|Bourgeoisie| . Since the antagonistic classes were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism, these methods were no longer necessary. Reform was needed for the Czechoslovak economy to join the scientific-technical revolution in the world , rather than relying on Stalinist-era  |heavy_industry|Heavy_Industry| , labour power, and raw materials. Ello , pp. 7–9, 129–31 Furthermore, since internal class conflict had been overcome, workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening  |Marxism_Leninism|Marxism_Leninism| . The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were filled by capable, educated socialist expert cadres in order to compete with capitalism.     Although it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately.  Radical elements became more vocal: anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press on 26 June 1968, the  |Social_Democrats|Czech_Social_Democratic_Party|  began to form a separate party, and new unaffiliated political clubs were created. Party conservatives urged repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership. Kusin , pp. 107–22 At the Presidium of the  |Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia|Communist_Party_Of_Czechoslovakia|  in April, Dubček announced a political programme of  |socialism_with_a_human_face|Socialism_With_A_Human_Face|  .  In May, he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on 9 September. The congress would incorporate the Action Programme into the party statutes, draft a federalization law, and elect a new Central Committee. Williams , p. 156     Dubčeks reforms guaranteed freedom of the press, and political commentary was allowed for the first time in mainstream media. Williams , p. 164 At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubčeks reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing  |planned|Planned_Economy|  and  |market_economies|Market_Economy| . Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more  |mixed_economy|Mixed_Economy|  while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule. Williams , pp. 18–22     On 27 June  |Ludvík_Vaculík|Ludvík_Vaculík| , a leading author and journalist, published a manifesto titled  The Two Thousand Words . It expressed concern about conservative elements within the KSČ and so-called foreign forces. Vaculík called on the people to take the initiative in implementing the reform programme.  Dubček, the party Presidium, the National Front, and the cabinet denounced this manifesto.             Dubčeks relaxation of censorship ushered in a brief period of freedom of speech and the press. Williams, Tieren. The Prague Spring and Its Aftermath: Czechoslovak Politics, 1968–1970. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 67. The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of openness was the production of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literarni noviny, renamed Literarni listy.     Freedom of the press also opened the door for the first honest look at Czechoslovakias past by Czechoslovakias people. Many of the investigations centered on the countrys history under communism, especially in the instance of the  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin| -period. In another television appearance, Goldstücker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history. The Writers Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet  |Jaroslav_Seifert|Jaroslav_Seifert| , to investigate the persecution of writers after the  |Communist_takeover_in_February_1948|Czechoslovak_Coup_Détat_Of_1948|  and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world.

Cambridge, UK: CUP Archive, 1973, p. 10 Holy, p. 119 Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily Prace . This was also helped by the Journalists Union, which by March 1968 had already persuaded the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions to foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news. Golan, p. 112     The press, the radio, and the television also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstücker,  |Pavel_Kohout|Pavel_Kohout| , and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as  |Josef_Smrkovský|Josef_Smrkovský| , Zdenek Hejzlar, and  |Gustav_Husak|Gustav_Husak| . Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new freedom of the press and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.            Initial reaction within the  |Communist_Bloc|Eastern_Bloc|  was mixed.  |Hungarys|Peoples_Republic_Of_Hungary| |_János_Kádár|János_Kádár|  was highly supportive of Dubčeks appointment in January, but  |Leonid_Brezhnev|Leonid_Brezhnev|  and others grew concerned about Dubčeks reforms, which they feared might weaken the position of the Communist Bloc during the  |Cold_War|Cold_War| . Navrátil , p. 37  Navrátil , pp. 172–81     At a meeting in  |Dresden|Dresden| , East Germany on 23 March, leaders of the Warsaw Five  questioned a Czechoslovak delegation over the planned reforms, suggesting any talk of democratization was a veiled criticism of other policies. Navrátil , pp. 64–72  |Władysław_Gomułka|Władysław_Gomułka|  and János Kádár were less concerned with the reforms themselves than with the growing criticisms levelled by the Czechoslovak media, and worried the situation might be similar to the prologue of the  |Hungarian_counterrevolution|Hungarian_Revolution_Of_1956|  . Some of the language in Aprils KSČ Action Programme may have been chosen to assert that no counterrevolution was planned, but Kieran Williams suggests that Dubček was perhaps surprised at, but not resentful of, Soviet suggestions. Williams , pp. 10–11     The Soviet leadership tried to stop, or limit, the changes in the ČSSR through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at  |Čierna_nad_Tisou|Čierna_Nad_Tisou| , near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, from 29 July to 1 August, with attendance of Brezhnev,  |Alexei_Kosygin|Alexei_Kosygin| ,  |Nikolai_Podgorny|Nikolai_Podgorny| ,  |Mikhail_Suslov|Mikhail_Suslov|  and others on the Soviet side and Dubček, Svoboda,  |Oldřich_Černík|Oldřich_Černík| , Smrkovský and others on the Czechoslovak side, Dubček defended the proposals of the reformist wing of the KSČ while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and  |Comecon|Comecon| . The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers  who supported Dubček, and conservatives  who adopted an anti-reformist stance. Navrátil , pp. 448–79     Brezhnev decided on compromise. The KSČ delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb anti-socialist tendencies, prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, and control the press more effectively. The Soviets agreed to withdraw their  |armed_forces|Military|  and permit the 9 September Party Congress.     On 3 August representatives from the Warsaw Five and Czechoslovakia met in  |Bratislava|Bratislava|  and signed the  |Bratislava_Declaration|Bratislava_Declaration| . The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to  |Marxism_Leninism|Marxism_Leninism|  and  |proletarian_internationalism|Proletarian_Internationalism|  and declared an implacable struggle against bourgeois ideology and all anti-socialist forces. Navrátil , pp. 326–29 The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in a Warsaw Pact country if a bourgeois system—a pluralist system of several political parties representing different factions of the capitalist class—was ever established. After the Bratislava conference, the Soviet Army left Czechoslovak territory but remained along its borders. Navrátil , pp. 326–27               As these talks proved unsatisfactory, the Soviets began to consider a military alternative. The Soviet Unions policy of compelling the socialist governments of its  |satellite_states|Satellite_State|  to subordinate their national interests to those of the Eastern Bloc became known as the  |Brezhnev_Doctrine|Brezhnev_Doctrine| . Chafetz , p. 10 On the night of 20–21 August 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries – the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary—invaded the ČSSR. Ouimet , pp. 34–35      That night, 200,000 troops and 2,000 tanks entered the country.  |Washington_Post|Washington_Post| , , 21 August 1968, p. A11 They first occupied the  |Ruzyně_International_Airport|Ruzyně_International_Airport| , where air deployment of more troops was arranged. The  |Czechoslovak_forces|Military_Of_The_Czech_Republic|  were confined to their barracks, which were surrounded until the threat of a counter-attack was assuaged. By the morning of 21 August Czechoslovakia was occupied.     Neither Romania nor Albania took part in the invasion.  Soviet command refrained from drawing upon East German troops for fear of reviving memories of the Nazi invasion in 1938.  During the invasion by the Warsaw Pact armies, 72   |Czechs|Czechs|  and  |Slovaks|Slovaks|  were killed , 266 severely wounded and another 436 slightly injured.  Williams , p. 158 Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist. Nevertheless, there was scattered resistance in the streets. Road signs in towns were removed or painted over—except for those indicating the way to Moscow. See Paul Chan, Fearless Symmetry Artforum International vol. 45, March 2007. Many small villages renamed themselves Dubcek or Svoboda ; thus, without navigational equipment, the invaders were often confused.      On the night of the invasion the Czechoslovak Presidium declared that Warsaw Pact troops had crossed the border without the knowledge of the ČSSR government, but the  |Soviet_Press|Central_Newspapers_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  printed an unsigned request – allegedly by Czechoslovak party and state leaders – for immediate assistance, including assistance with armed forces . Skilling At the 14th KSČ  |Party_Congress|Party_Congress|  , it was emphasized that no member of the leadership had invited the intervention. Navrátil , p. xviii More recent evidence suggests that conservative KSČ members did send a request for intervention to the Soviets. Fowkes , pp. 64–85 The invasion was followed by a previously unseen wave of emigration, which was stopped shortly thereafter. An estimated 70,000 fled immediately with an eventual total of some 300,000.      The Soviets attributed the invasion to the Brezhnev Doctrine , which stated that the U.S.S.R. had the right to intervene whenever a country in the Eastern Bloc appeared to be making a shift towards capitalism. Grenville , p. 780 There is still some uncertainty, however, as to what provocation, if any, occurred to make the Warsaw Pact armies invade. Preceding the invasion was a rather calm period without any major events taking place in Czechoslovakia.               In Czechoslovakia, especially in the week immediately following the invasion, popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of  |nonviolent_resistance|Nonviolent_Resistance| .

The generalized resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust the First Secretary. Dubček, who had been arrested on the night of 20 August, was taken to Moscow for negotiations. There, he and several other leaders signed the  |Moscow_Protocol|Moscow_Protocol| , under heavy psychological pressure from Soviet politicians, and it was agreed that Dubček would remain in office and a programme of moderate reform would continue.          On 25 August citizens of the Soviet Union who did not approve of the invasion  |protested_in_Red_Square|1968_Red_Square_Demonstration| ; seven protesters opened banners with anti-invasion slogans. The demonstrators were brutally beaten and arrested by security forces, and later punished by a secret tribunal; the protest was dubbed anti-Soviet and several people were detained in psychiatric hospitals. Gorbanevskaya     A more pronounced effect took place in Romania, where  |Nicolae_Ceaușescu|Nicolae_Ceaușescu| ,  |General_Secretary_of_the_Romanian_Communist_Party|General_Secretary_Of_The_Romanian_Communist_Party| , already a staunch opponent of Soviet influences and a self-declared Dubček supporter, gave a public speech in  |Bucharest|Bucharest|  on the day of the invasion, depicting Soviet policies in harsh terms. Albania withdrew from the  |Warsaw_Pact|Warsaw_Pact|  in opposition, calling the invasion an act of  |social_imperialism|Social_Imperialism|  . In Finland, a country under some Soviet political influence, the occupation caused a major scandal. Jutikkala, Pirinen     Like the  |Italian|Italian_Communist_Party|  and  |French|French_Communist_Party|   Communist parties, the majority of the  |Communist_Party_of_Finland|Communist_Party_Of_Finland|  denounced the occupation. Nonetheless,  |Finnish_president|President_Of_Finland| |_Urho_Kekkonen|Urho_Kekkonen|  was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of President  |Ludvík_Svoboda|Ludvík_Svoboda| , on 4 October 1969.

Most countries offered only vocal criticism following the invasion. The night of the invasion, Canada, Denmark, France, Paraguay, the United Kingdom and the United States requested a meeting of the  |United_Nations_Security_Council|United_Nations_Security_Council| . Franck At the meeting, the Czechoslovak ambassador  |Jan_Muzik|Jan_Muzik|  denounced the invasion. Soviet ambassador  |Jacob_Malik|Yakov_Malik|  insisted the Warsaw Pact actions were fraternal assistance against antisocial forces .     One of the nations that most vehemently condemned the invasion was China, which objected furiously to the so-called  |Brezhnev_Doctrine|Brezhnev_Doctrine|  that declared the Soviet Union alone had the right to determine what nations were properly Communist and could invade those Communist nations whose communism did not meet the Kremlins approval. Rea, p. 22.  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong|  saw the Brezhnev doctrine as the ideological basis for a Soviet invasion of China, and launched a massive propaganda campaign condemning the invasion of Czechoslovakia, despite his own earlier opposition to the Prague Spring. Speaking at a banquet at the Romanian embassy in Beijing on 23 August 1968, the Chinese Premier  |Zhou_Enlai|Zhou_Enlai|  denounced the Soviet Union for fascist politics, great power chauvinism, national egoism and social imperialism , going on to compare the invasion of Czechoslovakia to the American war in Vietnam and more pointedly to the policies of Adolf Hitler towards Czechoslovakia in 1938-39. Zhou ended his speech with a barely veiled call for the people of Czechoslovakia to wage guerrilla war against the Red Army.     The next day, several countries suggested a  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  resolution condemning the intervention and calling for immediate withdrawal. Eventually, a UN vote was taken with ten members supporting the motion; Algeria, India, and Pakistan abstained; the  |USSR|Ussr|  and Hungary opposed. Canadian delegates immediately introduced another motion asking for a UN representative to travel to Prague and work toward the release of the imprisoned Czechoslovak leaders.     By 26 August a new Czechoslovak representative requested the whole issue be removed from the Security Councils agenda.  |Shirley_Temple_Black|Shirley_Temple_Black|  visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare for becoming the US Ambassador for a free Czechoslovakia. However, after the 21 August invasion she became part of a U.S. Embassy-organized convoy of vehicles that evacuated U.S. citizens from the country. The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past By Alan Axelrod In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the  |Velvet_Revolution|Velvet_Revolution|  that ended 41 years of Communist rule.                In April 1969, Dubček was replaced as first secretary by  |Gustáv_Husák|Gustáv_Husák| , and a period of  |normalization|Normalization|  began. Williams , p. xi Dubček was expelled from the KSČ and given a job as a forestry official.      Husák reversed Dubčeks reforms, purged the party of its liberal members, and dismissed from public office professional and intellectual elites who openly expressed disagreement with the political transformation. Goertz , pp. 154–57 Husák worked to reinstate the power of the police and strengthen ties with the rest of the Communist bloc. He also sought to re- |centralize|Planned_Economy|  the economy, as a considerable amount of freedom had been granted to industries during the Prague Spring. Commentary on politics was forbidden in mainstream media, and political statements by anyone not considered to have full political trust were also banned. The only significant change that survived was the  |federalization_of_the_country|Federalization_Of_Czechoslovakia| , which created the  |Czech_Socialist_Republic|Czech_Socialist_Republic|  and the  |Slovak_Socialist_Republic|Slovak_Socialist_Republic|  in 1969.   In 1987, the Soviet leader  |Mikhail_Gorbachev|Mikhail_Gorbachev|  acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of  |glasnost|Glasnost|  and  |perestroika|Perestroika|  owed a great deal to Dubčeks socialism with a human face . Gorbachev , p. x When asked what the difference was between the Prague Spring and Gorbachevs own reforms, a Foreign Ministry spokesman replied, Nineteen years.      Dubček lent his support to the  |Velvet_Revolution|Velvet_Revolution|  of December 1989. After the collapse of the Communist regime that month, Dubček became chairman of the federal assembly under the  |Havel|Václav_Havel|  administration.

The Warsaw Pact invasion included attacks on media establishments, such as  |Radio_Prague|Radio_Prague|  and  |Czechoslovak_Television|Czechoslovak_Television| , almost immediately after the initial tanks rolled into Prague on 21 August 1968. Bren, p. 28 While both the radio station and the television station managed to hold out for at least enough time for initial broadcasts of the invasion, what the Soviets did not attack by force they attacked by reenacting party censorship. In reaction to the invasion, on 28 August 1968, all Czechoslovak publishers agreed to halt production of newspapers for the day to allow for a day of reflection for the editorial staffs. Williams, p. 147 Writers and reporters agreed with Dubcek to support a limited reinstitution of the censorship office, as long as the institution was to only last three months. Williams, p. 148 Finally, by September 1968, the  |Czechoslovak_Communist_Party|Czechoslovak_Communist_Party|  plenum was held to instate the new censorship law. In the words of the Moscow-approved resolution, The press, radio, and television are first of all the instruments for carrying into life the policies of the Party and state. Bren, p. 29     While this was not yet the end of the medias freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the beginning of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television. Williams, p. 175     The intellectuals were stuck at a bypass; they recognized the governments increasing normalization, but they were unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubceks promises for reform,  |Milan_Kundera|Milan_Kundera|  published the article Cesky udel in Literarni listy on 19 December. Williams, p. 182 He wrote: People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting that there are not enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, that we might again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials, that this or that could happen, are simply weak people, who can live only in illusions of certainty. Williams, p. 183     In March 1969, however, the new Soviet-backed Czechoslovakian government instituted full censorship, effectively ending the hopes that normalization would lead back to the freedoms enjoyed during the Prague Spring. A declaration was presented to the Presidium condemning the media as co-conspirators against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in their support of Dubceks liberalization measures. Finally, on 2 April 1969, the government adopted measures to secure peace and order through even stricter censorship, forcing the people of Czechoslovakia to wait until the  |thawing_of_Eastern_Europe|Cold_War|  for the return of a free media. Williams, p. 202     Former students from Prague, including  |Constantine_Menges|Constantine_Menges| , and Czech  |refugees|Refugees|  from the crisis, who were able to escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for  |human_rights|Human_Rights| ,  |religious_liberty|Religious_Liberty| ,  |freedom_of_speech|Freedom_Of_Speech|  and  |political_asylum|Political_Asylum|  for Czech  |political_prisoners|Political_Prisoners|  and  |dissidents|Dissidents| . Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and  |Red_Armys|Red_Army|  continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, before the fall of the  |Berlin_Wall|Berlin_Wall|  and collapse of  |Communism|Communism|  in  |Moscow|Moscow|  and Eastern Europe.       The Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of many Western leftists with  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  views. It contributed to the growth of  |Eurocommunist|Eurocommunism|  ideas in Western communist parties, which sought greater distance from the Soviet Union, and eventually led to the dissolution of many of these groups. Aspaturian , p. 174   A decade later, a period of Chinese political liberalization became known as the  |Beijing_Spring|Beijing_Spring| . It also partly influenced the  |Croatian_Spring|Croatian_Spring|  in  |Communist_Yugoslavia|Communist_Yugoslavia| . Despalatović , pp. 91–92 In a 1993 Czech survey, 60% of those surveyed had a personal memory linked to the Prague Spring while another 30% were familiar with the events in another form. Williams , p. 29 The demonstrations and regime changes taking place in North Africa and the Middle East from December 2010 have frequently been referred to as an  |Arab_Spring|Arab_Spring|  .     The event has been referenced in popular music, including the music of  |Karel_Kryl|Karel_Kryl| ,  |Luboš_Fišers|Luboš_Fišer|  Requiem,  and  |Karel_Husas|Karel_Husa|   Music for Prague 1968 .    The Israeli song Prague , written by  |Shalom_Hanoch|Shalom_Hanoch|  and performed by  |Arik_Einstein|Arik_Einstein|  at the Israel Song Festival of 1969, was a  |lamentation|Lamentation|  on the fate of the city after the Soviet invasion and mentions  |Jan_Palachs|Jan_Palach| |_Self_immolation|Self_Immolation| . , Mooma .

Waters has described it as a kind of  |Celtic|Celtis|  celebration of the Eastern European revolutions and their eventual outcome , quoting Dubčeks alleged comment: They may crush the flowers, but they cant stop the Spring.      The Prague Spring is featured in several works of literature.  |Milan_Kundera|Milan_Kundera|  set his novel  The Unbearable Lightness of Being  during the Prague Spring. It follows the repercussions of increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. Kundera , p. 1 A  |film_version|The_Unbearable_Lightness_Of_Being|  was released in 1988.  The Liberators , by  |Viktor_Suvorov|Viktor_Suvorov| , is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, from the point of view of a Soviet tank commander. Suvorov , p. 1  Rock n Roll , a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright  |Tom_Stoppard|Tom_Stoppard| , references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989  |Velvet_Revolution|Velvet_Revolution| .   |Heda_Margolius_Kovály|Heda_Margolius_Kovály|  also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events. Margolius-Kovály , pp. 178–92.     In film there has been an adaptation of  |The_Unbearable_Lightness_of_Being|The_Unbearable_Lightness_Of_Being| , and also the movie  Pelíšky  from director  |Jan_Hřebejk|Jan_Hřebejk|  and screenwriter Petr Jarchovský, which depicts the events of the Prague Spring and ends with the invasion by the Soviet Union and their allies. The Czech musical film,  Rebelové  from  |Filip_Renč|Filip_Renč| , also depicts the events, the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration.      The number 68 has become iconic in the former  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| .  |Hockey|Ice_Hockey|  player  |Jaromír_Jágr|Jaromír_Jágr| , whose grandfather died in prison during the rebellion, wears the number because of the importance of the year in Czechoslovak history. Morrison , pp. 158–59  A former publishing house based in  |Toronto|Toronto| ,  |68_Publishers|68_Publishers| , that published books by exiled Czech and Slovak authors, took its name from the event.        |Anarchist|Anarchism| |_Colin_Ward|Colin_Ward|  argues that a significantly anarchist street culture developed during the Prague Spring as citizens became increasingly defiant of government authorities and began to occupy workplaces while creating  |mutual_aid|Mutual_Aid|  networks between telephone workers, truck drivers and university students. Furthermore, during the Soviet invasion, anarchists took to the streets and battled tanks and soldiers with rocks, molotov cocktails and improvised weapons.  Colin Ward describes it in detail: In a broadcast on the anniversary of the Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia a speaker looked back to the summer of 1968 in Prague as one in which, as she put it, Everyone had become more gentle, more considerate. Crime and violence diminished. We all seemed to be making a special effort to make life tolerable, just because it had been so intolerable before . Now that the Prague Spring and the Czechoslovak long hot summer have retreated into history, we tend to forget - though the Czechs will not forget - the change in the quality of ordinary life, while the historians, busy with the politicians floating on the surface of events, or this or that memorandum from a Central Committee or a Praesidium, tell us nothing about what it felt like for people in the streets. At the time John Berger wrote of the immense impression made on him by the transformation of values: Workers in many places spontaneously offered to work for nothing on Saturdays in order to contribute to the national fund. Those for whom, a few months before, the highest ideal was a consumer society, offered money and gold to help save the national economy. I saw crowds of workers in the streets of Prague, their faces lit by an evident sense of opportunity and achievement. Such an atmosphere was bound to be temporary. But it was an unforgettable indication of the previously unused potential of a people: of the speed with which demoralisation may be overcome. And Harry Schwartz of the New York Times reminds us that Gay, spontaneous, informal and relaxed were the words foreign correspondents used to described the vast outpouring of merry Prague citizens. What was Dubcek doing at the time? He was trying to set limits on the spontaneous revolution that had been set in motion and tried to curb it. No doubt he had hoped to honour the promises he had given at Dresden that he would impose order on what more and more conservative Communists were calling anarchy . When the Soviet tanks rolled in to impose their order, the spontaneous order gave way to a spontaneous resistance. Of Prague, Kamil Winter declared, I must confess to you that nothing was organised at all. Everything went on spontaneously ... And of the second day of the invasion of Bratislava, Ladislav Mnacko wrote: Nobody has given any order. Nobody was giving any orders at all. People knew of their own accord what needed to be done. Each and every one of them was their own government, with its orders and regulations, while the government itself was somewhere very far away, probably in Moscow. Everything the occupation forces tried to paralyse went on working and even worked better than in normal times; by the evening the people had even managed to deal with the bread situation. In November, when the students staged a sit-in at the universities, the sympathy of the population with the students was shown by the dozens of trucks sent in from the factories to bring about food free of charge, and Pragues railway workers threatened to strike if the government took reprisal measures against the students. Workers of various state organisations supplied them with food. The buses of the urban transport workers were placed at the strikers disposal ... Postal workers established certain free telephone communications between university towns.           The photographs taken in Vinohradskà Avenue and  |Wenceslas_Square|Wenceslas_Square|  are widely represented in the photographic archive of the 1968 invasion while other sites of protests are missing. The memory of the Prague Spring is marked by the Czech republics and Slovakias desire to avoid unpleasant collective memories leading to a process of historical amnesia and narrative whitewashing. Photographs taken by  |Josef_Koudelka|Josef_Koudelka|  portray memories of the invasion such as a memorial to the victims set up in Wenceslas Square.  There are many omnipresent signs of memorial of the soviet invasion in the city of Prague.      During the invasion, protesters set up several memorials to record the location of the victims’ death. The  |Jan_Palach|Jan_Palach|  memorial is a monument remembering the suicide of a student in 1969. This place is often called the “boulevard of history” Palach was the first to kill himself in  |Wenceslas_Square|Wenceslas_Square|  but was not the last, he was belonging to a student pact of resistance.  There is also the memorial for the victims of communism in Prague is a narrowing staircase along which seven male bronze silhouettes descend. The first one, the one at the bottom, is complete, while the others gradually disappear. It aims at representing the same person at different phases of the destruction caused by communist ideology.        The Prague Spring has deeply marked the history of communism in Eastern Europe even though its outcomes were modest. Rather than remembering the cultural democratization, the opening of the press and its impact on the emergence of a new form of socialism, history textbooks consider the Prague Spring as one of the major crises of Socialism in the Soviet bloc. The memory has acquired a negative significance as marking disillusion of political hopes within Eastern European communism.  Indeed, long hidden and rejected from the collective memory, the Prague Spring of 1968 is rarely commemorated in Prague and is often considered a painful defeat, symbol of disappointed hope and a surrender that heralds twenty years of normalisation. It was not until the 2000s, following the publication of texts dating from 1968, such as Milan Kundera, Cesky udel , and  |Vaclav_Havel|Václav_Havel| ,  Cesky udel?  published in 2007 in the weekly magazine Literarni Noviny  , that the debate on the Prague Spring resumed. Indeed, the posterity of the Prague Spring remains first and foremost the memory of the military intervention of the Warsaw Pact as well as the failure of a reform within a communist regime, which definitely discredited the Dubcekian revisionist perspective in the East. The memory of the Prague Spring is thus largely obscured and often overviewed. Indeed, the Prague Spring also deeply impacted the Czech society and should also be remembered for the cultural momentum that accompanied and illustrated this movement, of which there are still films, novels, and plays. The Prague Spring also influenced a renewal of the Prague artistic and cultural scene as well as a liberalization of society which deeply marked the following years. The 1960s indeed saw the emergence of a major shift in Czechoslovakia with cultural changes and movement coming from the West, notably rock music and sub-cultural movements which are the symbol of a cultural renewal for Czechoslovakia. The Czech sixties were thus a process of emancipation of culture from the constraints of existing political structures, and were the prelude to the upheavals of 1968.  In fact, the regimes political crisis did not begin with Dubceks election as party leader on 5 January 1968, but with the break-up speeches delivered at the Writers Congress in June 1967 by  |Ludvik_Vaculik|Ludvík_Vaculík| ,  |Milan_Kundera|Milan_Kundera|  and  |Antonin_Liehm|Antonín_J_Liehm| . In addition, the revitalization of the society was also an essential component of the Prague Spring. Indeed, the great achievements of the Prague Spring, i. e. the abolition of censorship, the restoration of individual and collective freedoms... have revitalized society, which has begun to express itself more freely. Although the Prague Spring only restored what had existed thirty years earlier in Czechoslovakia, the spring of 1968 had a profound and long lasting impact on the society.     Recently, the anniversary of the 50 years of the conflict raised the question of the memory of the Prague Spring. The  |European_Commission|European_Commission|  Vice-President  |Maroš_Šefčovič|Maroš_Šefčovič| , himself a Slovak, reminded us on the occasion that “we should never tolerate a breach of international law, crushing people’s legitimate yearning for freedom and democracy”. The European justice commissioner  |Věra_Jourová|Věra_Jourová|  also made a speech. However, the memory is still very conflicted as demonstrated when the Czech Republics pro-Russian President  |Miloš_Zeman_r|Miloš_Zeman|  efused to attend any ceremony remembering the Prague Spring, and didnt give any speech in memory of the numerous death.      The memory of the Prague Spring is also transmitted through testimonies of former Czechoslovak citizens. In a 2018 article,  |Radio_Free_Europe|Radio_Free_Europe_Radio_Liberty|  collected testimonies of four women who witnessed the Warsaw Pact troops invasion and bravely acted. Stanislava Draha who volunteered to help some of the 500 wounded testifies says that the invasion had a major impact on her life. Besides, Vera Homolova, a radio reporter broadcasting the invasion from a covert studio testifies “ I experienced the Soviet-led troops shooting recklessly into the Czechoslovak Radio’s building, into windows” . In the aftermath, Vera Roubalova, who reacted as a student to the occupation by demonstrating posters, that tensions were still present towards the countries that occupied Czechoslovakia. On the night of August 20–21, 137 Czechoslovaks died during the invasion.
