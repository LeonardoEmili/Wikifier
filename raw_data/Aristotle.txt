Aristotle  was a Greek  |philosopher|Philosopher|  and  |polymath|Polymath|  during the  |Classical_period|Classical_Greece|  in  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| .
He was the founder of the  |Lyceum|Lyceum|  and the  |Peripatetic_school|Peripatetic_School|  of philosophy and  |Aristotelian|Aristotelianism|  tradition.
Along with his teacher  |Plato|Plato| , he has been called the Father of  |Western_Philosophy|Western_Philosophy|  .
His writings cover many subjects – including  |physics|Physics| ,  |biology|Biology| ,  |zoology|Zoology| ,  |metaphysics|Metaphysics| ,  |logic|Logic| , ethics,  |aesthetics|Aesthetics| ,  |poetry|Poetics| , theatre, music,  |rhetoric|Rhetoric| ,  |psychology|Psychology| ,  |linguistics|Linguistics| ,  |economics|Economics| ,  |politics|Politics|  and government.
Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual  |lexicon|Lexicon| , as well as problems and methods of inquiry.
Aristotle was born in the city of  |Stagira|Stagira|  in  |Northern_Greece|Northern_Greece| .
His father,  |Nicomachus|Nicomachus| , died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian.
At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined  |Platos_Academy|Platos_Academy|  in  |Athens|Athens|  and remained there until the age of thirty-seven .
Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of  |Philip_II_of_Macedon|Philip_Ii_Of_Macedon| , tutored  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  beginning in 343 BC.
He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on  |papyrus|Papyrus| |_scrolls|Scrolls| .
Aristotles views on  |physical_science|Aristotelian_Physics|  profoundly shaped medieval scholarship.
Their influence extended from  |Late_Antiquity|Late_Antiquity|  and the  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages|  into the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , and were not replaced systematically until  |the_Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  and theories such as  |classical_mechanics|Classical_Mechanics| .
Some of Aristotles zoological observations found in  |his_biology|Aristotles_Biology| , such as on the  |hectocotyl_arm|Hectocotylus|  of the  |octopus|Octopus| , were disbelieved until the 19th century.
His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as  |Peter_Abelard|Peter_Abelard|  and  |John_Buridan|John_Buridan| .
He influenced  |Islamic_thought|Judeo_Islamic_Philosophies|  during the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , as well as  |Christian_theology|Christian_Theology| , especially the  |Neoplatonism|Neoplatonism|  of the  |Early_Church|Early_Church|  and the  |scholastic|Scholasticism|  tradition of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| .
Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as The First Teacher and among medieval Christians like  |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  as simply The Philosopher .
His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of  |virtue_ethics|Virtue_Ethics| , such as in the thinking of  |Alasdair_MacIntyre|Alasdair_Macintyre|  and  |Philippa_Foot|Philippa_Foot| .
Aristotle, whose name means the best purpose in Ancient Greek, was born in 384  BC in  |Stagira|Stagira| ,  |Chalcidice|Chalcidice| , about 55  km east of modern-day  |Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki| .
His father  |Nicomachus|Nicomachus|  was the personal physician to  |King_Amyntas_of_Macedon|Amyntas_Iii_Of_Macedon| .
Both of Aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen, and  |Proxenus_of_Atarneus|Proxenus_Of_Atarneus|  became his guardian.
Although little information about Aristotles childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the  |Macedonian_monarchy|Macedonia_Kingship_And_The_Royal_Court| .
At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at  |Platos_Academy|Platonic_Academy| .
He probably experienced the  |Eleusinian_Mysteries|Eleusinian_Mysteries|  as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, to experience is to learn  Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47  BC.
The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academys direction after control passed to Platos nephew  |Speusippus|Speusippus| , although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.
Aristotle then accompanied  |Xenocrates|Xenocrates|  to the court of his friend  |Hermias_of_Atarneus|Hermias_Of_Atarneus|  in  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor| .
After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil  |Theophrastus|Theophrastus|  to the island of  |Lesbos|Lesbos| , where together they researched the  |botany|Botany|  and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon.
While in Lesbos, Aristotle married  |Pythias|Pythias| , either Hermiass adoptive daughter or niece.
In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by  |Philip_II_of_Macedon|Philip_Ii_Of_Macedon|  to become the tutor to his son  |Alexander|Alexander_The_Great| .
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of  |Macedon|Macedon| .
During Aristotles time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings:  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy_I_Soter|  and  |Cassander|Cassander| .
Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotles own attitude towards  |Persia|Persia|  was unabashedly  |ethnocentric|Ethnocentricism| .
By 335  BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the  |Lyceum|Lyceum| .
While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with  |Herpyllis|Herpyllis|  of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father,  |Nicomachus|Nicomachus| .
According to the  Suda , he also had an  erômenos ,  |_Palaephatus_of_Abydus|Palaephatus| .
Those works that have survived are in  |treatise|Treatise|  form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students.
A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexanders death, but the only evidence of this is an  |unlikely_claim|Hagnothemis|  made some six years after the death.
In 322  BC, Demophilus and  |Eurymedon_the_Hierophant|Eurymedon_The_Hierophant|  reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in  |_Chalcis_on_Euboea|Chalcis| , at which occasion he was said to have stated: I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy  – a reference to Athenss  |trial_and_execution_of_Socrates|Trial_Of_Socrates| .
He died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year, having named his student  |Antipater|Antipater|  as his chief  |executor|Executor|  and leaving a  |will|Will|  in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.
With the  Prior Analytics , Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic| .
|Kant|Immanuel_Kant|  stated in the  Critique of Pure Reason  that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.
Organon        What we today call Aristotelian logic with its  |types_of_syllogism|Syllogismtypes|  , Aristotle himself would have labelled analytics .
The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the  Organon  around 40 BC by  |Andronicus_of_Rhodes|Andronicus_Of_Rhodes|  or others among his followers.
He wrote in his Metaphysics :                 Aristotle examines the concepts of  |substance|Substance_Theory|   and  |essence|Essence|   in his Metaphysics , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called  |hylomorphism|Hylomorphism| .
In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the  |substratum|Material_Substratum| , or the stuff of which it is composed.
For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other  |differentia|Genus_Differentia_Definition|  that let us define something as a house.
Like his teacher Plato, Aristotles philosophy aims at the  |universal|Problem_Of_Universals| .
Aristotles  |ontology|Ontology|  places the universal  in  |particulars|Particular|  , things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate.
For Aristotle, form is still what  |phenomena|Phenomena|  are based on, but is instantiated in a particular substance.
Plato argued that all things have a  |universal_form|Theory_Of_Forms| , which could be either a property or a relation to other things.
In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a  |final_cause|Final_Cause|  or end.
Since, according to  |Plato|Plato|  there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity?
Aristotles immanent realism means his  |epistemology|Epistemology|  is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal  |Forms|Theory_Of_Forms|  and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.
Aristotle uses  |induction|Inductive_Reasoning|  from examples alongside  |deduction|Deductive_Reasoning| , whereas Plato relies on deduction from  a priori  principles.
In his  On Generation and Corruption , Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by  |Empedocles|Empedocles| ,  |Earth|Earth| ,  |Water|Water| ,  |Air|Air| , and  |Fire|Fire| , to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry.
Aristotles scheme added the heavenly  |Aether|Aether| , the divine substance of the  |heavenly_spheres|Celestial_Spheres| , stars and planets.
In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also; in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, since Aristotle does not address  |friction|Friction| .
In the Physics , Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density, ρ, of the fluid in which it is falling:     :: vc      Aristotle implies that in a  |vacuum|Vacuum|  the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible.
|Archimedes|Archimedes|  corrected Aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they  |displace_enough_water|Archimedes_Principle| ; floating depends in Archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not as Aristotle thought its elementary composition.
Aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the  |Early_Modern|Early_Modern|  period.
|John_Philoponus|John_Philoponus|   and  |Galileo|Galileo_Galilei|  are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.
A contrary opinion is given by  |Carlo_Rovelli|Carlo_Rovelli| , who argues that Aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the  |Earths|Earth|  gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air.
Newtons forced motion corresponds to Aristotles violent motion with its external agent, but Aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval  |theory_of_impetus|Theory_Of_Impetus| .
|Material_cause|Material_Cause|  describes the material out of which something is composed.
|formal_cause|Formal_Cause|  is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter.
|efficient_cause|Efficient_Cause|  is the primary source , or that from which the change under consideration proceeds.
In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of  |how_it_develops_from_the_egg|Developmental_Biology| , and  |how_its_body_functions|Physiology| .
|final_cause|Final_Cause|   is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities.
In the case of living things, it implies  |adaptation|Adaptation|  to a particular way of life.
Aristotle describes experiments in  |optics|Optics|  using a  |camera_obscura|Camera_Obscura|  in  Problems , book 15.
The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small  |aperture|Aperture|  that let light in.
Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of  |accidental_things|Accident| , from what is spontaneous .
In  |astronomy|Astronomy| , Aristotle refuted  |Democrituss|Democritus|  claim that the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays, pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.
Aristotle was one of the first people to record any  |geological|Geology|  observations.
He stated that  |geological_change|Uniformitarianism|  was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime.
The geologist  |Charles_Lyell|Charles_Lyell|  noted that Aristotle described such change, including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers , giving as examples the growth of the  |Nile_delta|Nile_Delta|  since the time of  |Homer|Homer| , and the upheaving of one of the  |Aeolian_islands|Aeolian_Islands| , previous to a  |volcanic_eruption|Volcanic_Eruption| .
He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of  |Lesbos|Lesbos|  and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos.
His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on  |botany|Botany|  have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.
He describes the  |catfish|Catfish| ,  |electric_ray|Electric_Ray| , and  |frogfish|Frogfish|  in detail, as well as  |cephalopods|Cephalopod|  such as the  |octopus|Octopus|  and  |paper_nautilus|Paper_Nautilus| .
His description of the  |hectocotyl_arm|Hectocotylus|  of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century.
He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of  |ruminants|Ruminant| , and of the  |ovoviviparous|Ovoviviparity|  embryological development of the  |hound_shark|Hound_Shark| .
He notes that an animals structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the  |heron|Heron| , which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas  |ducks|Duck|  that swim have short legs and webbed feet.
|Darwin|Charles_Darwin| , too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of  |evolution|Evolution| .
Aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or  |hybridisations|Hybridisation|  could occur, he saw these as rare accidents.
To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a  |common_ancestor|Common_Descent| , or that one kind can  |change_into_another|Speciation| , or that kinds can become  |extinct|Extinction| .
This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as  |genomics|Genomics| .
From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of  |rules|Biological_Rules|  relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods that he studied.
|Lifespan|Life_Expectancy|  increases with  |gestation_period|Gestation_Period| , and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier.
As a final example,  |fecundity|Fecundity|  decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.
Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of  |animals|Animal| , arranging these in the History of Animals in a graded scale of perfection, a  scala naturae , with man at the top.
His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave  |live_birth|Viviparity|  to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs.
Animals came above  |plants|Plant| , and these in turn were above minerals.
see also: He grouped what the modern zoologist would call  |vertebrates|Vertebrate|  as the hotter animals with blood , and below them the colder  |invertebrates|Invertebrate|  as animals without blood .
Those without blood were insects, crustacea  and the hard-shelled  |molluscs|Mollusc|  .
He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a  |placenta|Placenta|  like the tetrapods.
To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is  |convergent_evolution|Convergent_Evolution| .
He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this  |teleological|Teleological|  view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.
Aristotles  |psychology|Psychology| , given in his treatise  On the Soul  , posits three kinds of  |soul|Soul|  : the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul.
For Aristotle, the soul is the  |form|Hylomorphismbody–Soul_Hylomorphism|  of a living being.
Notable is Aristotles division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of  |Alcmaeon|Alcmaeon_Of_Croton| .
A memory occurs when  |stimuli|Stimulus|  such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once.
These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian  |common_sense|Common_Sense| , and thinking.
Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and  |contiguity|Contiguity| , described in his  |laws_of_association|Laws_Of_Association| .
Aristotelian  |just_war_theory|Just_War_Theory|  is not well regarded in the present day, especially his view that warfare was justified to enslave natural slaves .
In Aristotelian philosophy, the abolition of what he considers  |natural_slavery|Natural_Slavery|  would undermine civic  |freedom|Freedom| .
Aristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war, extolling it as a chance for  |virtue|Virtue|  and writing that the leisure that accompanies peace tends to make people arrogant .
This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with  |social_contract|Social_Contract|  theory, according to which individuals leave the  |state_of_nature|State_Of_Nature|  because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences.
In  Protrepticus , the character Aristotle states:                 Aristotle made substantial contributions to  |economic_thought|Economics| , especially to thought in the Middle Ages.
In  Politics , Aristotle addresses the city,  |property|Property| , and  |trade|Trade| .
His response to criticisms of  |private_property|Private_Property| , in  |Lionel_Robbinss|Lionel_Robbins|  view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall  |utility|Utility|  of social arrangements.
Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from  |human_nature|Human_Nature| .
In Politics, Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of  |money|Money| .
For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or  |silver|Silver| .
Aristotles discussions on  |retail|Retail|  and  |interest|Interest|  was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages.
He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a  |profit|Profit| .
He also categorises rhetoric into three genres:  |epideictic|Epideictic|  ,  |forensic|Forensic_Rhetoric|  , and  |deliberative|Deliberative_Rhetoric|  .
Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical  |proofs|Proof|  enthymeme   and  paradeigma  .
Aristotle writes in his Poetics that  |epic_poetry|Epic_Poetry| , tragedy, comedy,  |_dithyrambic_poetry|Dithyramb| , painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of  mimesis  , each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.
Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what  |Stephen_Halliwell|Stephen_Halliwell|  calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.
Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the  |catharsis|Catharsis|  of those same emotions.
Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the  |Delphic_Oracle|Pythia|  and studied the fables of  |Aesop|Aesop| .
On this ground, proponents of  |feminist_metaphysics|Feminist_Metaphysics|  have accused Aristotle of  |misogyny|Misogyny|  and  |sexism|Sexism| .
According to the philosopher  |Bryan_Magee|Bryan_Magee| , it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did .
Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of  |formal_logic|Formal_Logic| ,  pioneered the study of  |zoology|Zoology| , and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.
|Jonathan_Barnes|Jonathan_Barnes|  wrote that an account of Aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought .
Aristotles pupil and successor,  |Theophrastus|Theophrastus| , wrote the  History of Plants , a pioneering work in botany.
Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as  |carpel|Carpel|  from carpos, fruit, and  |pericarp|Pericarp| , from pericarpion, seed chamber.
The immediate influence of Aristotles work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the  |Peripatetic_school|Peripatetic_School| .
Aristotles notable students included  |Aristoxenus|Aristoxenus| ,  |Dicaearchus|Dicaearchus| ,  |Demetrius_of_Phalerum|Demetrius_Of_Phalerum| ,  |Eudemos_of_Rhodes|Eudemos_Of_Rhodes| ,  |Harpalus|Harpalus| ,  |Hephaestion|Hephaestion| ,  |Mnason_of_Phocis|Mnason_Of_Phocis| ,  |Nicomachus|Nicomachus| , and Theophrastus.
It is not until the age of  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  under the  |Ptolemies|Ptolemaic_Kingdom|  that advances in biology can be again found.
The first medical teacher at Alexandria,  |Herophilus_of_Chalcedon|Herophilos| , corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation.
Herophilus also distinguished between  |veins|Vein|  and  |arteries|Artery| , noting that the latter  |pulse|Pulse|  while the former do not.
Though a few ancient  |atomists|Atomism|  such as  |Lucretius|Lucretius|  challenged the  |teleological|Teleology|  viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology  would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries.
|Ernst_Mayr|Ernst_Mayr|  states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.
The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and  |Stephen_of_Alexandria|Stephen_Of_Alexandria|  in the early seventh century.
|John_Philoponus|John_Philoponus|  stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotles views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.
Philoponus questioned Aristotles teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the  |theory_of_impetus|Theory_Of_Impetus|  to explain his observations.
After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and  |Michael_of_Ephesus|Michael_Of_Ephesus|  reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by  |Anna_Comnena|Anna_Comnena| .
Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early  |Islamic_theology|Islamic_Theology| .
|Averroes|Averroes| ,  |Avicenna|Avicenna|  and  |Alpharabius|Alpharabius| , who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced  |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers.
|Alkindus|Alkindus|  greatly admired Aristotles philosophy, and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers.
The title teacher was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers  who were influenced by the tradition of  |Islamic_philosophy|Islamic_Philosophy| .
With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early  |medieval|Medieval|  Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the Organon made by  |Boethius|Boethius| .
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by  |Gerard_of_Cremona|Gerard_Of_Cremona| , and from the original Greek, such as those by  |James_of_Venice|James_Of_Venice|  and  |William_of_Moerbeke|William_Of_Moerbeke| .
After the  |Scholastic|Scholasticism|  Thomas Aquinas wrote his  Summa Theologica , working from Moerbekes translations and calling Aristotle The Philosopher , the demand for Aristotles writings grew, and the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| .
Scholars such as Boethius,  |Peter_Abelard|Peter_Abelard| , and  |John_Buridan|John_Buridan|  worked on Aristotelian logic.
The medieval English poet  |Chaucer|Geoffrey_Chaucer|  describes his student as being happy by having          A  |cautionary_medieval_tale|The_Tale_Of_Phyllis_And_Aristotle|  held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the kings seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her, and allowed her to ride him.
Artists such as  |Hans_Baldung|Hans_Baldung|  produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme.
The Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in  The Divine Comedy             In the  |Early_Modern|Early_Modern|  period, scientists such as  |William_Harvey|William_Harvey|  in England and  |Galileo_Galilei|Galileo_Galilei|  in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like  |Galen|Galen| , establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment.
Harvey demonstrated the  |circulation_of_the_blood|Circulation_Of_The_Blood| , establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat, as Aristotle thought.
The 19th-century German philosopher  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche|  has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.
It was  |Martin_Heidegger|Martin_Heidegger| , not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.
The English mathematician  |George_Boole|George_Boole|  fully accepted Aristotles logic, but decided to go under, over, and beyond it with his system of  |algebraic_logic|Boolean_Algebra|  in his 1854 book  The Laws of Thought .
This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check  |validity|Validity| , and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.
The philosopher  |Bertrand_Russell|Bertrand_Russell|    argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine .
The Dutch historian of science  |Eduard_Jan_Dijksterhuis|Eduard_Jan_Dijksterhuis|  wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceed so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses.
In 1985, the biologist  |Peter_Medawar|Peter_Medawar|  could still state in pure seventeenth century  tones that Aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility .
|Ayn_Rand|Ayn_Rand|  accredited Aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking.
More recently,  |Alasdair_MacIntyre|Alasdair_Macintyre|  has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.
Kukkonen observed, too, that that most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander remained current, as in the 2004 film  Alexander , while the firm rules of Aristotles theory of drama have ensured a role for the Poetics in  |Hollywood|Cinema_Of_The_United_States| .
|Armand_Marie_Leroi|Armand_Marie_Leroi|  has reconstructed Aristotles biology, while  |Niko_Tinbergens_four_questions|Tinbergens_Four_Questions| , based on Aristotles four causes, are used to analyse  |animal_behaviour|Animal_Behaviour| ; they examine  |function|Function| ,  |phylogeny|Phylogeny| ,  |mechanism|Mechanism| , and  |ontogeny|Ontogeny| .
Reference to them is made according to the organisation of  |Immanuel_Bekkers|Immanuel_Bekker|  Royal Prussian Academy edition , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.
