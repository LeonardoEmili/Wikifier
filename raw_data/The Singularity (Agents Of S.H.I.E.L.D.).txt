S.H.I.E.L.D. scrambles to repair the damage  |Daisy|Daisy_Johnson|  did to the base, while  |Coulson|Phil_Coulson| , who sustained a leg injury, resolves to defeat  |Hive|Hive|  and save Daisy. Fitz, Simmons and Lincoln determine that the effect of Hives infection will prevent those Inhumans he controls from being sedated. Realizing Alisha would be a powerful asset to Hive, Coulson, May and Lincoln visit her, only to find she has already been infected and has gone with Hive, leaving her duplicates to attack them. After the duplicates are killed, Coulson orders Lincoln to stay out of the field until they have a cure for Hives infection.     Hive and Daisy approach  |James|Hellfire| , revealing they know he has another Kree artefact connected to the orb, which Hive describes as the only thing that can destroy him. They induce his Terrigenesis, giving him the ability to explosively charge objects , and Hive enthrals him, learning he buried the companion artifact beneath his home. Daisys use of her seismokinetic powers to unearth the artefact attracts the attention of SHIELD, and Coulson and May arrive to find the Inhumans already gone, along with the artefact. The hut is destroyed by a planted bomb, but Coulson protects himself and May with an  |energy_shield|Captain_Americas_Shield|  projected from his robotic hand.     Meanwhile, Fitz, Simmons and Mack decide to seek out  |Holden_Radcliffe|Holden_Radcliffe| , who was in charge of  |Transias|Spacetime|  work against invasive organisms, before he was fired for his  |transhumanist|Transhumanism|  beliefs. While continuing to discuss how to proceed with their relationship, Fitz and Simmons infiltrate a transhumanist social club to find Radcliffe, under the guise of geneticists wanting to sell him eye prosthetic technology based on those used for Project  |Deathlok|Deathlok| . Upon meeting Radcliffe they reveal their true intentions and ask for his help to devise a cure for Hives infection, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Hive himself and his Inhuman allies. Alisha abducts Radcliffe, while Daisy subdues Fitz with her powers and warns him of her vision of an agents death, wanting S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop trying to combat Hive, and avoid that future from coming to pass. Mack narrowly escapes James, and Hive approaches Simmons, speaking to her as Will, using his memories, only for her to shoot him and escape, after deriding him for trying to be someone he murdered. The three agents reconvene at a hotel, where Fitz and Simmons finally consummate their relationship while Mack goes to the quinjet .     Under Coulsons direction,  |Talbot|Glenn_Talbot|  and the ATCU use information Malick provided before his death to neutralize what is left of Hydra, with the exception of the forces commanded by Hive. So all HYDRA facilities, buildings and stations are bombed and destroyed, with Coulson and May looking on, satisfied.     In an end tag, Hive brings Daisy, Radcliffe, Alisha, and James to a town he bought with Malicks money. Seeking to make Earth the home Inhumans deserve, he reveals his intention to recreate the original Kree experiments and convert the entire human race into Inhumans, with Radcliffes medical and scientific help.
