In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , one can often define a direct product of objects already known, giving a new one. This generalizes the  |Cartesian_product|Cartesian_Product|  of the underlying  |sets|Set| , together with a suitably defined structure on the product set. More abstractly, one talks about the  |product_in_category_theory|Product| , which formalizes these notions.     Examples are the product of sets,  |groups|Group|  ,  |rings|Product_Ring| , and other  |algebraic_structures|Algebraic_Structures| . The  |product|Product_Topology|  of  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space|  is another instance.     There is also the  |direct_sum|Direct_Sum|  – in some areas this is used interchangeably, while in others it is a different concept.         If we think of   as the set of real numbers, then the direct product     is just the Cartesian product   .   If we think of   as the  |group|Group|  of real numbers under addition, then the direct product     still has   as its underlying set. The difference between this and the preceding example is that     is now a group, and so we have to also say how to add their elements. This is done by defining + .   If we think of   as the  |ring|Ring|  of real numbers, then the direct product     again has   as its underlying set. The ring structure ring consists of addition defined by + and multiplication defined by .   However, if we think of   as the  |field|Field|  of real numbers, then the direct product     does not exist – naively defining addition and multiplication componentwise as in the above example would not result in a field since the element does not have a  |multiplicative_inverse|Multiplicative_Inverse| .     In a similar manner, we can talk about the direct product of finitely many algebraic structures, e.g.               . This relies on the fact that the direct product is  |associative|Associative|  up to  |isomorphism|Isomorphism| . That is,   C   A   for any algebraic structures A , B , and C of the same kind. The direct sum is also  |commutative|Commutative|  up to isomorphism, i.e. A   B   B   A for any algebraic structures A and B of the same kind. We can even talk about the direct product of infinitely many algebraic structures; for example we can take the direct product of  |countably|Countably_Infinite|  many copies of   R , which we write as               .          In  |group_theory|Group|  one can define the direct product of two groups  and , denoted by G × H. For  |abelian_groups|Abelian_Group|  which are written additively, it may also be called the  |direct_sum_of_two_groups|Direct_Sum_Of_Groups| , denoted by G   H .     It is defined as follows:   the  |set|Set|  of the elements of the new group is the Cartesian product of the sets of elements of G and H, that is ;   on these elements put an operation, defined element-wise:   :  ×          This construction gives a new group. It has a  |normal_subgroup|Normal_Subgroup|  isomorphic to G , and one isomorphic to H .     The reverse also holds, there is the following recognition theorem: If a group K contains two normal subgroups G and H, such that K GH and the intersection of G and H contains only the identity, then K is isomorphic to G × H. A relaxation of these conditions, requiring only one subgroup to be normal, gives the  |semidirect_product|Semidirect_Product| .     As an example, take as G and H two copies of the unique group of order 2, C 2 : say  and . Then C 2 ×C 2 , with the operation element by element. For instance,   , and   .     With a direct product, we get some natural  |group_homomorphisms|Group_Homomorphism|  for free: the projection maps define by   :       G   H   G,       & g       G   H   H,       & h       called the coordinate functions.     Also, every homomorphism f to the direct product is totally determined by its component functions   fi     f .     For any group  and any integer n ≥ 0, repeated application of the direct product gives the group of all n- |tuples|Tuple|  G n , for example Z n and R n .       The direct product for  |modules|Module|   is very similar to the one defined for groups above, using the Cartesian product with the operation of addition being componentwise, and the scalar multiplication just distributing over all the components. Starting from R we get  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space|  R n , the prototypical example of a real n-dimensional vector space. The direct product of R m and R n is R m+n .     Note that a direct product for a finite index   Xi is identical to the  |direct_sum|Direct_Sum_Of_Modules|    Xi . The direct sum and direct product differ only for infinite indices, where the elements of a direct sum are zero for all but for a finite number of entries. They are dual in the sense of  |category_theory|Category_Theory| |coproduct|Coproduct| , while the direct product is the product.     For example, consider X    and Y    , the infinite direct product and direct sum of the real numbers. Only sequences with a finite number of non-zero elements are in Y. For example, is in Y but is not. Both of these sequences are in the direct product X; in fact, Y is a proper subset of X .         The direct product for a collection of  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space|  X i  for i in I, some index set, once again makes use of the Cartesian product     :   Xi.     Defining the  |topology|Topology|  is a little tricky. For finitely many factors, this is the obvious and natural thing to do: simply take as a  |basis|Basis|  of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor:     :   B       This topology is called the  |product_topology|Product_Topology| . For example, directly defining the product topology on R 2 by the open sets of R , the basis for this topology would consist of all disjoint unions of open rectangles in the plane .     The product topology for infinite products has a twist, and this has to do with being able to make all the projection maps continuous and to make all functions into the product continuous if and only if all its component functions are continuous : we take as a basis of open sets to be the collection of all Cartesian products of open subsets from each factor, as before, with the proviso that all but finitely many of the open subsets are the entire factor:     :   B       The more natural-sounding topology would be, in this case, to take products of infinitely many open subsets as before, and this does yield a somewhat interesting topology, the  |box_topology|Box_Topology| . However it is not too difficult to find an example of bunch of continuous component functions whose product function is not continuous . The problem which makes the twist necessary is ultimately rooted in the fact that the intersection of open sets is only guaranteed to be open for finitely many sets in the definition of topology.     Products are nice with respect to preserving properties of their factors; for example, the product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff; the product of connected spaces is connected, and the product of compact spaces is compact. That last one, called  |Tychonoffs_theorem|Tychonoffs_Theorem| , is yet another equivalence to the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| .     For more properties and equivalent formulations, see the separate entry  |product_topology|Product_Topology| .       On the Cartesian product of two sets with  |binary_relations|Binary_Relation|  R and S, define T as aRc and bSd. If R and S are both  |reflexive|Reflexive_Relation| ,  |irreflexive|Irreflexive_Relation| ,  |transitive|Transitive_Relation| ,  |symmetric|Symmetric_Relation| , or  |antisymmetric|Antisymmetric_Relation| , then T will be also.  Combining properties it follows that this also applies for being a  |preorder|Preorder|  and being an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation| . However if R and S are  |total_relations|Total_Relation| , T is in not general total.       If Σ is a fixed  |signature|Signature| , I is an arbitrary index set, and  i∈I is an  |indexed_family|Indexed_Family|  of Σ algebras, the direct product A ∏ i∈I A i is a Σ algebra defined as follows:   The universe set A of A is the Cartesian product of the universe sets A i of A i , formally: A ∏ i∈I A i ;   For each n and each n-ary operation symbol , its interpretation f A in A is defined componentwise, formally: for all  and each , the ith component of  is defined as .   For each , the ith projection  is defined by . It is a  |surjective_homomorphism|Surjective_Homomorphism|  between the Σ algebras A and A i . Stanley N. Burris and H.P. Sankappanavar, 1981. http://www.thoralf.uwaterloo.ca/htdocs/ualg.html A Course in Universal Algebra. Springer-Verlag. . Here: Def.7.8, p.53     As a special case, if the index set  the direct product of two Σ algebras A 1 and A 2 is obtained, written as . If Σ just contains one binary operation f, the  |above|Group_Direct_Product|  definition of the direct product of groups is obtained, using the notation , , , , and . Similarly, the definition of the direct product of modules is subsumed here.            The direct product can be abstracted to an arbitrary  |category|Category_Theory| . In a general category, given a collection of objects A i  and a collection of  |morphisms|Morphism|  p i  from A to A i  with i ranging in some index set I, an object A is said to be a categorical product in the category if, for any object B and any collection of morphisms f i  from B to A i , there exists a unique morphism f from B to A such that f i p i f and this object A is unique. This not only works for two factors, but arbitrarily many.     For groups we similarly define the direct product of a more general, arbitrary collection of groups G i  for i in I, I an index set. Denoting the Cartesian product of the groups by G we define multiplication on G with the operation of componentwise multiplication; and corresponding to the p i  in the definition above are the projection maps     :     G   Gi        gi ,     the functions that take to its ith component g i .                  Some authors draw a distinction between an internal direct product and an external direct product. If A, B   X and A   B   X , then we say that X is an internal direct product of A and B, while if A and B are not subobjects then we say that this is an external direct product.       A metric on a Cartesian product of metric spaces, and a norm on a direct product of normed vector spaces, can be defined in various ways, see for example  |p-norm|Norm_P-Norm| .
