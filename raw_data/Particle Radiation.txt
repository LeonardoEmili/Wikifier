   Particle radiation is the  |radiation|Radiant_Energy|  of energy by means of fast-moving  |subatomic_particles|Subatomic_Particle| . Particle radiation is referred to as a  |particle_beam|Particle_Beam|  if the particles are all moving in the same direction, similar to a  |light_beam|Light_Beam| .     Due to the  |wave–particle_duality|Wave–Particle_Duality| , all moving particles also have wave character. Higher energy particles more easily exhibit particle characteristics, while lower energy particles more easily exhibit wave characteristics.       Particles can be  |electrically_charged|Charged_Particle|  or uncharged:     Particle radiation can be emitted by an unstable  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  , or it can be the product from some other kind of  |nuclear_reaction|Nuclear_Reaction| . Many types of particles may be emitted:      |protons|Proton|  and other  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  nuclei stripped of their electrons   positively charged  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  , equivalent to a  |helium-4|Helium-4|  nucleus    |helium|Helium|  ions at high energy levels    |HZE_ions|Hze_Ions| , which are nuclei heavier than helium   positively or negatively charged  |beta_particles|Beta_Particle|     high-speed electrons that are not from the  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  process, but others such as  |internal_conversion|Internal_Conversion|  and  |Auger_effect|Auger_Effect| |photons|Photon| |neutrons|Neutron| , subatomic particles which have no charge;  |neutron_radiation|Neutron_Radiation| |neutrinos|Neutrino| |mesons|Meson| |muons|Muon|      Mechanisms that produce particle radiation include:    |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay| |Auger_effect|Auger_Effect| |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| |cluster_decay|Cluster_Decay| |internal_conversion|Internal_Conversion| |neutron_emission|Neutron_Emission| |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission|  and  |spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission| |nuclear_fusion|Nuclear_Fusion| |particle_colliders|Particle_Collider|  in which streams of high energy particles are smashed    |proton_emission|Proton_Emission| |solar_flares|Solar_Flares| |solar_particle_events|Solar_Particle_Events| |supernova|Supernova|  explosions   Additionally,  |galactic_cosmic_rays|Galactic_Cosmic_Rays|  include these particles, but many are from unknown mechanisms     Charged particles  can be produced by  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator| . Ion irradiation is widely used in the  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  industry to introduce  |dopants|Dopant|  into   materials, a method known as  |ion_implantation|Ion_Implantation| .     Particle accelerators can also produce  |neutrino|Neutrino|  beams. Neutron beams are mostly produced by  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor| . For the production of  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation| , there are many methods, depending upon the  |wave_length|Wave_Length|  .          In  |radiation_protection|Radiation_Protection| , radiation is often separated into two categories,  ionizing  and  non-ionizing , to denote the level of danger posed to humans.  |Ionization|Ionization|  is the process of removing electrons from atoms, leaving two electrically charged particles behind. The negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions created by ionizing radiation may cause damage in living tissue. Basically, a particle is ionizing if its energy is higher than the  |ionization_energy|Ionization_Potential|  of a typical substance, i.e., a few  |eV|Electronvolt| , and interacts with electrons significantly.     According to the  |International_Commission_on_Non-Ionizing_Radiation_Protection|International_Commission_On_Non-Ionizing_Radiation_Protection| , electromagnetic radiations from ultraviolet to infrared, to radiofrequency radiation, static and time-varying electric and magnetic fields, and  |ultrasound|Ultrasound|  belong to the non-ionizing radiations.     The charged particles mentioned above all belong to the ionizing radiations. When passing through matter, they  |ionize|Ionization|  and thus lose energy in many small steps. The distance to the point where the charged particle has lost all its energy is called the  |range|Range|  of the particle. The range depends upon the type of particle, its initial energy, and the material it traverses. Similarly, the energy loss per unit path length, the  |stopping_power|Stopping_Power| , depends on the type and energy of the charged particle and upon the material. The stopping power and hence, the density of ionization, usually increases toward the end of range and reaches a maximum, the  |Bragg_Peak|Bragg_Peak| .
