Bradbury had just graduated from high school when he met Robert Heinlein, then 31 years old. Bradbury recalled, He was well known, and he wrote humanistic science fiction, which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical.

There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious. Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were  |Norma_Shearer|Norma_Shearer| ,  |Laurel_and_Hardy|Laurel_And_Hardy| , and  |Ronald_Colman|Ronald_Colman| .

In 1939, Bradbury joined  |Laraine_Days|Laraine_Day|  Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years, he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, so incredibly bad that he gave up playwriting for two decades.  Bradburys first paid piece, Pendulum , written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine Super Science Stories in November 1941, for which he earned $15.

It was later published at about 50,000 words under the name Fahrenheit 451, for a total cost of $9.80, due to the librarys typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour.      A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer  |Christopher_Isherwood|Christopher_Isherwood|  gave Bradbury the opportunity to put  The Martian Chronicles  into the hands of a respected critic. Isherwoods glowing review  followed.       Bradbury attributed his lifelong habit of writing every day to two incidents.

Ray Bradbury. Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition : UFO. November 10, 2010. The second incident occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword, made his hair stand on end, and shouted, Live forever!  Bradbury remarked, I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico... gave me a future...I began to write, full-time.

Bradbury resisted that categorization, however:          Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at the beach and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he wrote about it, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.

In regard to his education, Bradbury said:        He told  The Paris Review , You cant learn to write in college. Its a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do – and they dont.

It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics Dandelion Wine,  Something Wicked This Way Comes , and Farewell Summer, as well as in many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradburys favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to  |Charles_Dickens|Charles_Dickens| .  Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in Summer Morning, Summer Night, a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.

Bradbury wrote many short essays on the culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that Fahrenheit 451 touches on the alienation of people by media:        Bradbury stated the novel worked as a critique of the later development of  |political_correctness|Political_Correctness|      In a 1982 essay, he wrote, People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it .

He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editors idea; he suggested, You could call it The Martian Chronicles. Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became The Martian Chronicles.       What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, Summer Morning, Summer Night, started out to be Bradburys first true novel. The core of the work was Bradburys witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.     In the winter of 1955–56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book Dandelion Wine. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it Farewell Summer. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.     The most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, Summer Morning, Summer Night, in 2007. , by Ray Bradbury; PS Publishing, 2007             From 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradburys stories were adapted by  |Al_Feldstein|Al_Feldstein|  for  |EC_Comics|Ec_Comics|  and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks,  The Autumn People  and  Tomorrow Midnight  , both published by  |Ballantine_Books|Ballantine_Books|  with cover illustrations by  |Frank_Frazetta|Frank_Frazetta| .
