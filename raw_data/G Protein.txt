           G proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a  |family_of_proteins|Protein_Family|  that act as  |molecular_switch|Molecular_Switch| es inside cells, and are involved in transmitting signals from a variety of stimuli outside a  |cell|Cell|  to its interior. Their activity is regulated by factors that control their ability to bind to and hydrolyze  |guanosine_triphosphate|Guanosine_Triphosphate|  to  |guanosine_diphosphate|Guanosine_Diphosphate|  . When they are bound to GTP, they are on, and, when they are bound to GDP, they are off. G proteins belong to the larger group of enzymes called  |GTPases|Gtpase| .     There are two classes of G proteins. The first function as  |monomeric|Monomeric| |small_GTPases|Small_Gtpase|  , while the second function as  |heterotrimeric_G_protein|Heterotrimeric_G_Protein| |complexes|Protein_Complex| . The latter class of complexes is made up of  alpha  , beta and gamma  |subunits|Protein_Subunit| .  In addition, the beta and gamma subunits can form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the  |beta-gamma_complex|G_Beta-Gamma_Complex|    .      Heterotrimeric G proteins located within the cell are activated by  |G_protein-coupled_receptors|G_Protein-Coupled_Receptor|  that span the cell membrane.  Signaling molecules bind to a domain of the GPCR located outside the cell, and an intracellular GPCR domain then in turn activates a particular G protein. Some active-state GPCRs have also been shown to be pre-coupled with G proteins. The G protein activates a cascade of further signaling events that finally results in a change in cell function. G protein-coupled receptor and G proteins working together transmit signals from many  |hormones|Hormone| ,  |neurotransmitters|Neurotransmitter| , and other signaling factors.  G proteins regulate metabolic  |enzymes|Enzyme| ,  |ion_channels|Ion_Channel| ,  |transporter_proteins|Membrane_Transport_Protein| , and other parts of the cell machinery, controlling  |transcription|Transcription| ,  |motility|Motility| ,  |contractility|Contractility| , and  |secretion|Secretion| , which in turn regulate diverse systemic functions such as  |embryonic_development|Embryonic_Development| , learning and memory, and  |homeostasis|Homeostasis| .             G proteins were discovered when  |Alfred_G._Gilman|Alfred_G._Gilman|  and  |Martin_Rodbell|Martin_Rodbell|  investigated stimulation of cells by  |adrenaline|Adrenaline| . They found that when adrenaline binds to a receptor, the receptor does not stimulate enzymes directly. Instead, the receptor stimulates a G protein, which then stimulates an enzyme. An example is  |adenylate_cyclase|Adenylate_Cyclase| , which produces the  |second_messenger|Second_Messenger| |cyclic_AMP|Cyclic_Amp| . , Illustrated Lecture. For this discovery, they won the 1994  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine| .  The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1994 jointly to Alfred G. Gilman and Martin Rodbell for their discovery of G-proteins and the role of these proteins in signal transduction in cells . 10 October 1994     Nobel prizes have been awarded for many aspects of signaling by G proteins and GPCRs. These include  |receptor_antagonists|Receptor_Antagonist| ,  |neurotransmitters|Neurotransmitters| , neurotransmitter  |reuptake|Reuptake| ,  |G_protein-coupled_receptors|G_Protein-Coupled_Receptor| , G proteins,  |second_messengers|Second_Messenger| , the enzymes that trigger protein  |phosphorylation|Phosphorylation|  in response to  |cAMP|Cyclic_Adenosine_Monophosphate| , and consequent metabolic processes such as  |glycogenolysis|Glycogenolysis| .

The 2004  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|  to  |Richard_Axel|Richard_Axel|  and  |Linda_B._Buck|Linda_B._Buck|  for their work on G protein-coupled  |olfactory_receptors|Olfactory_Receptor| .    The 2012  |Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry|Nobel_Prize_In_Chemistry|  to  |Brian_Kobilka|Brian_Kobilka|  and  |Robert_Lefkowitz|Robert_Lefkowitz|  for their work on GPCR function.        G proteins are important  |signal_transducing|Signal_Transducing|  molecules in cells. Malfunction of GPCR signaling pathways are involved in many diseases, such as  |diabetes|Diabetes| , blindness, allergies, depression, cardiovascular defects, and certain forms of  |cancer|Cancer| . It is estimated that about 30% of the modern drugs cellular targets are GPCRs.  The human genome encodes roughly 800   |G_protein-coupled_receptors|G_Protein-Coupled_Receptors| , which detect photons of light, hormones, growth factors, drugs, and other endogenous  |ligands|Ligand| . Approximately 150 of the GPCRs found in the human genome still have unknown functions.     Whereas G proteins are activated by  |G_protein-coupled_receptors|G_Protein-Coupled_Receptor| , they are inactivated by  |RGS_proteins|Regulator_Of_G_Protein_Signalling|  . Receptors stimulate GTP binding . RGS proteins stimulate GTP hydrolysis .          All eukaryotes use G proteins for signaling and has evolved a large diversity of G proteins. For instance, humans encode 18 different G α proteins, 5 G β proteins, and 12 G γ proteins.       G protein can refer to two distinct families of proteins.  |Heterotrimeric_G_proteins|Heterotrimeric_G_Protein| , sometimes referred to as the large G proteins, are activated by  |G_protein-coupled_receptors|G_Protein-Coupled_Receptor|  and are made up of alpha , beta , and gamma  |subunits|Protein_Subunit| .  Small G proteins belong to the  |Ras|Ras|  superfamily of  |small_GTPases|Small_Gtpase| . These proteins are  |homologous|Sequence_Homology|  to the alpha subunit found in heterotrimers, but are in fact monomeric, consisting of only a single unit. However, like their larger relatives, they also bind GTP and GDP and are involved in  |signal_transduction|Signal_Transduction| .          Different types of heterotrimeric G proteins share a common mechanism. They are activated in response to a  |conformational_change|Conformational_Change|  in the GPCR, exchanging GDP for GTP, and dissociating in order to activate other proteins in a particular  |signal_transduction|Signal_Transduction|  pathway. The specific mechanisms, however, differ between protein types.          Receptor-activated G proteins are bound to the inner surface of the  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane| . They consist of the G α and the tightly associated G βγ subunits. There are many classes of G α subunits: G s α , G i α , G o α , G q/11 α, and G 12/13 α are some examples. They behave differently in the recognition of the effector molecule, but share a similar mechanism of activation.      |ligand|Ligand|  activates the  |G_protein-coupled_receptor|G_Protein-Coupled_Receptor| , it induces a conformational change in the receptor that allows the receptor to function as a  |guanine_nucleotide_exchange_factor|Guanine_Nucleotide_Exchange_Factor|  that exchanges GDP for GTP – thus turning the GPCR on . The GTP is bound to the G α subunit in the traditional view of heterotrimeric GPCR activation. This exchange triggers the dissociation of the G α subunit from the G βγ dimer and the receptor as a whole. However, models which suggest molecular rearrangement, reorganization, and pre-complexing of effector molecules are beginning to be accepted.    Both G α -GTP and G βγ can then activate different signaling cascades  and effector proteins, while the receptor is able to activate the next G protein.       |hydrolyze|Hydrolysis|  the attached GTP to GDP by its inherent  |enzymatic|Enzyme|  activity, allowing it to re-associate with G βγ and starting a new cycle. A group of proteins called  |Regulator_of_G_protein_signalling|Regulator_Of_G_Protein_Signalling|  , act as  |GTPase-activating_proteins|Gtpase-Activating_Proteins|  , are specific for G α subunits. These proteins accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, thus terminating the transduced signal. In some cases, the effector itself may possess intrinsic GAP activity, which then can help deactivate the pathway. This is true in the case of  |phospholipase_C|Phospholipase_C| -beta, which possesses GAP activity within its  |C-terminal|C-Terminus|  region. This is an alternate form of regulation for the G α subunit. Such G α GAPs do not have catalytic residues to activate the G α protein. They work instead by lowering the required activation energy for the reaction to take place.           G αs  activates the  |cAMP-dependent_pathway|Camp-Dependent_Pathway|  by stimulating the production of  |cyclic_AMP|Cyclic_Amp|  from  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate| . This is accomplished by direct stimulation of the membrane-associated enzyme  |adenylate_cyclase|Adenylate_Cyclase| . cAMP can then act as a second messenger that goes on to interact with and activate  |protein_kinase_A|Protein_Kinase_A|  . PKA can phosphorylate a myriad downstream targets.     The  |cAMP-dependent_pathway|Camp-Dependent_Pathway|  is used as a signal transduction pathway for many hormones including:      |ADH|Antidiuretic_Hormone|  – Promotes water retention by the  |kidneys|Kidneys| |GHRH|Ghrh|  – Stimulates the synthesis and release of GH     |GHIH|Ghih|  – Inhibits the synthesis and release of GH    |CRH|Corticotropin-Releasing_Hormone|  – Stimulates the synthesis and release of ACTH    |ACTH|Acth|  – Stimulates the synthesis and release of  |cortisol|Cortisol| |TSH|Thyroid-Stimulating_Hormone|  – Stimulates the synthesis and release of a majority of  |T4|Thyroxine| |LH|Luteinizing_Hormone|  – Stimulates follicular maturation and ovulation in women; or testosterone production and spermatogenesis in men    |FSH|Follicle_Stimulating_Hormone|  – Stimulates follicular development in women; or  |spermatogenesis|Spermatogenesis|  in men    |PTH|Parathyroid_Hormone|  – Increases  |blood_calcium|Blood_Calcium|  levels. This is accomplished via the  |parathyroid_hormone_1_receptor|Parathyroid_Hormone_1_Receptor|  in the kidneys and bones, or via the  |parathyroid_hormone_2_receptor|Parathyroid_Hormone_2_Receptor|  in the central nervous system and brain, as well as the bones and kidneys.    |Calcitonin|Calcitonin|  – Decreases blood calcium levels     |Glucagon|Glucagon|  – Stimulates  |glycogen|Glycogen|  breakdown in the liver    |hCG|Human_Chorionic_Gonadotropin|  – Promotes cellular differentiation, and is potentially involved in  |apoptosis|Apoptosis| .     |Epinephrine|Epinephrine|  – released by the  adrenal medulla  during the fasting state, when body is under metabolic duress. It stimulates  |glycogenolysis|Glycogenolysis| , in addition to the actions of  |glucagon|Glucagon| .      G αi  inhibits the production of cAMP from ATP.   eg. somatostatin,prostaglandins      G αq/11  stimulates the membrane-bound  |phospholipase_C|Phospholipase_C|  beta, which then cleaves PIP 2  into two second messengers,  |IP3|Inositol_Trisphosphate|  and  |diacylglycerol|Diglyceride|  .   The Inositol Phospholipid Dependent Pathway is used as a signal transduction pathway for many hormones including:   ADH  – Induces the synthesis and release of  |glucocorticoids|Glucocorticoid|  ; Induces vasoconstriction    TRH – Induces the synthesis and release of TSH    TSH – Induces the synthesis and release of a small amount of T4    Angiotensin II – Induces Aldosterone synthesis and release    GnRH – Induces the synthesis and release of FSH and LH      G α12/13  are involved in Rho family GTPase signaling . This is through the RhoGEF superfamily involving the  |RhoGEF_domain|Rhogef_Domain|  of the proteins structuresα20-kDa to 25-kDa |GTP|Guanosine_Triphosphate|.
