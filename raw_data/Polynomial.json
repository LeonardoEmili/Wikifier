Moreover, the functional notation is often useful for specifying, in a single phrase, a polynomial and its indeterminate. For example, let P be a polynomial is a shorthand for let P be a polynomial in the indeterminate x . On the other hand, when it is not necessary to emphasize the name of the indeterminate, many formulas are much simpler and easier to read if the name of the indeterminate do not appear at each occurrence of the polynomial.     The ambiguity of having two notations for a single mathematical object may be formally resolved by considering the general meaning of the functional notation for polynomials.   If a denotes a number, a variable, another polynomial, or, more generally any expression, then P denotes, by convention, the result of substituting a for x in P. Thus, the polynomial P defines the function   : a  P,   which is the polynomial function associated to P.   Frequently, when using this notation, one supposes that a is a number.
