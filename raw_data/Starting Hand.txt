   In  |poker|Poker| , a starting hand is the initial set of cards dealt to a player before any voluntary betting takes place.

The one decision made by every poker player on every deal of every game is whether to continue playing that hand after seeing that first set of cards.

Optimal starting hand standards can be very sensitive to factors such as the  |betting_structure|Betting|  of a game,  |position|Position|.
