Carl Friedrich Michael Meinhof was a  |German|Germany| |linguist|Linguistics|  and one of the first linguists to study  |African_languages|African_Languages| .       Meinhof was born in  |Barzwitz|Barzowice|  near  |Rügenwalde|Darłowo|  in the  |Province_of_Pomerania|Province_Of_Pomerania| . He studied at the  |University_of_Tübingen|University_Of_Tübingen|  and at the  |University_of_Greifswald|University_Of_Greifswald| . In 1905 he became professor at the  |School_of_Oriental_Studies|School_Of_Oriental_Studies,_Berlin|  in  |Berlin|Berlin| . On 5 May 1933 he became a member of the  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party| .       His most notable work was developing comparative  |grammar|Grammar|  studies of the  |Bantu_languages|Bantu_Languages| , building on the pioneering work of  |Wilhelm_Bleek|Wilhelm_Heinrich_Immanuel_Bleek| . In his work, Meinhof looked at the common  |Bantu_languages|Bantu_Languages|  such as  |Swahili|Swahili_Language|  and  |Zulu|Zulu_Language|  to determine similarities and differences.     In his work, Meinhof looked at  |noun_class|Noun_Class| es with all Bantu languages having at least 10 classes and with 22 classes of nouns existing throughout the Bantu languages, though his definition of noun class differs slightly from the accepted one, considering the plural form of a word as belonging to a different class from the singular form . While no language has all 22 classes active,  |Venda|Venda_Language|  has 20,  |Lozi|Lozi_Language|  has 18, and  |Ganda|Ganda_Languagenoun_Classes|  has 16 or 17 . All Bantu languages have a noun class specifically for humans .     Meinhof also examined other African languages, including groups classified at the time as  |Kordofanian|Kordofanian_Languages| ,  |Bushman|Khoisan_Languages| ,  |Khoikhoi|Khoikhoi| , and  |Hamitic|Hamitic_Languages| .     Meinhof developed a comprehensive classification scheme for African languages. His classification was the standard one for many years . It was replaced by those of  |Joseph_Greenberg|Joseph_Greenberg|  in 1955 and in 1963.     In 1902, Meinhof made recordings of East African music. These are among the first recordings made of traditional  |African_music|African_Music| .       In 1912, Carl Meinhof published Die Sprachen der Hamiten . He used the term  |Hamitic|Hamitic| . Meinhofs system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the Negroes of Africa. Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African History, CRC Press, 2005, p.797 However, in the case of the so-called  |Nilo-Hamitic_languages|Nilo-Hamitic_Languages|  , it was based on the typological feature of gender and a fallacious theory of  |language_mixture|Mixed_Language| . Meinhof did this in spite of earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston demonstrating that the languages which he would later dub Nilo-Hamitic were in fact  |Nilotic_languages|Nilotic_Languages|  with numerous similarities in vocabulary with other Nilotic languages.
