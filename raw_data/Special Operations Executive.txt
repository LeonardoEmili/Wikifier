        The Special Operations Executive was a British  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  organisation. It was officially formed on 22 July 1940 under  |Minister_of_Economic_Warfare|Minister_Of_Economic_Warfare| |_Hugh_Dalton|Hugh_Dalton| , from the amalgamation of three existing secret organisations. Its purpose was to conduct  |espionage|Espionage| ,  |sabotage|Sabotage|  and  |reconnaissance|Reconnaissance|  in  |occupied_Europe|Occupied_Europe|   against the  |Axis_powers|Axis_Powers| , and to aid local  |resistance_movements|Resistance_During_World_War_Ii| .     Few people were aware of SOEs existence. Those who were part of it or liaised with it were sometimes referred to as the  |Baker_Street_Irregulars|Baker_Street_Irregulars|  , after the location of its London headquarters. It was also known as Churchills Secret Army or the Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare . Its various branches, and sometimes the organisation as a whole, were concealed for security purposes behind names such as the Joint Technical Board or the Inter-Service Research Bureau , or fictitious branches of the  |Air_Ministry|Air_Ministry| ,  |Admiralty|Admiralty|  or  |War_Office|War_Office| .     SOE operated in all territories occupied or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britains principal  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  . It also made use of neutral territory on occasion, or made plans and preparations in case neutral countries were attacked by the Axis. The organisation directly employed or controlled more than 13,000 people, about 3,200 of whom were women.     After the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946. A memorial to SOEs agents was unveiled in October 2009 on the  |Albert_Embankment|Albert_Embankment|  by  |Lambeth_Palace|Lambeth_Palace|  in London.            The organisation was formed from the merger of three existing secret departments, which had been formed shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. Immediately after Germany  |annexed|Annexation| |_Austria|Austria|   in March 1938, the  |Foreign_Office|Foreign_Office|  created a propaganda organisation known as  |Department_EH|Department_Eh|  , run by Canadian newspaper  |magnate|Magnate|  Sir  |Campbell_Stuart|Campbell_Stuart| . Later that month, the  |Secret_Intelligence_Service|Secret_Intelligence_Service|  formed a section known as Section D, under Major Lawrence Grand  |RE|Royal_Engineers| , to investigate the use of sabotage, propaganda, and other irregular means to weaken an enemy. In the autumn of the same year, the  |War_Office|War_Office|  expanded an existing research department known as GS and appointed Major J. C. Holland RE as its head to conduct research into  |guerrilla_warfare|Guerrilla_Warfare| . GS was renamed MI in early 1939.     These three departments worked with few resources until the outbreak of war. There was much overlap between their activities. Section D and EH duplicated much of each others work. On the other hand, the heads of Section D and MI knew each other and shared information. They agreed to a rough division of their activities; MI researched irregular operations that could be undertaken by regular uniformed troops, while Section D dealt with truly undercover work.     During the early months of the war, Section D was based first at  |St_Ermins_Hotel|St_Ermins_Hotel|  in Westminster and then the  |Metropole_Hotel|Metropole_Hotel_London|  near Trafalgar Square.  The Section attempted unsuccessfully to sabotage deliveries of vital  |strategic_materials|Strategic_Material|  to Germany from neutral countries by mining the  |Iron_Gate|Iron_Gate|  on the  |River_Danube|River_Danube| . MI meanwhile produced pamphlets and technical handbooks for guerrilla leaders. MI was also involved in the formation of the  |Independent_Companies|Independent_Company| , autonomous units intended to carry out sabotage and guerrilla operations behind enemy lines in the  |Norwegian_Campaign|Norwegian_Campaign| , and the  |Auxiliary_Units|Auxiliary_Units| , stay-behind commando units based on the Home Guard which would act in the event of an  |Axis|Axis_Powers|  invasion of Britain, as seemed possible in the early years of the war.       On 13 June 1940, at the instigation of newly appointed Prime Minister  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| ,  |Lord_Hankey|Maurice_Hankey_1St_Baron_Hankey|   persuaded Section D and MI that their operations should be coordinated. On 1 July, a Cabinet level meeting arranged the formation of a single sabotage organisation. On 16 July,  |Hugh_Dalton|Hugh_Dalton| , the  |Minister_of_Economic_Warfare|Minister_Of_Economic_Warfare| , was appointed to take political responsibility for the new organisation, which was formally created on 22 July 1940. Dalton recorded in his diary that on that day the War Cabinet agreed to his new duties and that Churchill had told him, And now go and set Europe ablaze.  Dalton used the  |Irish_Republican_Army|Irish_Republican_Army|  during the  |Irish_War_of_Independence|Irish_War_Of_Independence|  as a model for the organisation.  Hugh Dalton letter to Lord Halifax 2 July 1940; quoted in M. R. D. Foot, SOE in France, p. 8      |Sir_Frank_Nelson|Frank_Nelson|  was nominated by SIS to be director of the new organisation, and a senior  |civil_servant|Civil_Service| ,  |Gladwyn_Jebb|Gladwyn_Jebb| , transferred from the Foreign Office to it, with the title of Chief Executive Officer. Campbell Stuart left the organisation, and the flamboyant Major Grand was returned to the regular army. At his own request, Major Holland also left to take up a regular appointment in the Royal Engineers.  However, Hollands former deputy at MI, Brigadier  |Colin_Gubbins|Colin_Gubbins| , returned from command of the Auxiliary Units to be Director of Operations of SOE.     One department of MI, MI R, which was involved in the development of weapons for irregular warfare, was not formally integrated into SOE but became an independent body codenamed  |MD1|Md1| . Directed by Major  |Millis_Jefferis|Millis_Jefferis| , it was located at  |The_Firs|The_Firs_Whitchurch|  in  |Whitchurch|Whitchurch_Buckinghamshire|  and nicknamed Churchills Toyshop from the Prime Ministers close interest in it and his enthusiastic support.        The director of SOE was usually referred to by the initials CD . Nelson, the first director to be appointed, was a former head of a trading firm in  |India|India| , a  |back_bench|Backbencher|  Conservative Member of Parliament and  |Consul|Consul|  in  |Basel|Basel| ,  |Switzerland|Switzerland| . There he had also been engaged in undercover intelligence work.     In February 1942 Dalton became  |President_of_the_Board_of_Trade|President_Of_The_Board_Of_Trade|  and was replaced as Minister of Economic Warfare by  |Lord_Selborne|Roundell_Palmer_3Rd_Earl_Of_Selborne| . Selborne in turn retired Nelson, who had suffered ill health as a result of his hard work, and appointed Sir  |Charles_Hambro|Charles_Jocelyn_Hambro| , head of  |Hambros_Bank|Hambros_Bank| , to replace him. He also transferred Jebb back to the Foreign Office.     Hambro had been a close friend of Churchill before the war and had won the  |Military_Cross|Military_Cross|  in the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| . He retained several other interests, for example remaining chairman of Hambros and a director of the  |Great_Western_Railway|Great_Western_Railway| . Some of his subordinates and associates expressed reservations that these interests distracted him from his duties as director. Selborne and Hambro nevertheless cooperated closely until August 1943, when they fell out over the question of whether SOE should remain a separate body or co-ordinate its operations with those of the  |British_Army|British_Army|  in several theatres of war. Hambro felt that any loss of autonomy would cause a number of problems for SOE in the future. At the same time, Hambro was found to have failed to pass on vital information to Selborne. He was dismissed as director, and became head of a  |raw_materials|Raw_Material|  purchasing commission in Washington, D.C., which was involved in the exchange of nuclear information.        As part of the subsequent closer ties between the  |Imperial_General_Staff|Chief_Of_The_Imperial_General_Staff|  and SOE , Hambros replacement as director from September 1943 was Gubbins, now a Major-general. Gubbins had wide experience of  |commando|Commando|  and  |clandestine_operations|Clandestine_Operation|  and had played a major part in MIs and SOEs early operations. He also put into practice many of the lessons he learned from the  |IRA|Irish_Republican_Army|  during the  |Irish_War_of_Independence|Irish_War_Of_Independence| .         The organisation of SOE continually evolved and changed during the war. Initially, it consisted of three broad departments: SO1, which dealt with propaganda; SO2 ; and SO3 . SO3 was quickly overloaded with paperwork and was merged into SO2. In August 1941, following quarrels between the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the  |Ministry_of_Information|Ministry_Of_Information|  over their relative responsibilities, SO1 was removed from SOE and became an independent organisation, the  |Political_Warfare_Executive|Political_Warfare_Executive| .     Thereafter, a single, broad Operations department controlled the Sections operating into enemy and sometimes neutral territory, and the selection and training of agents. Sections, usually referred to by code letters or groups of letters, were assigned to a single country. Some enemy-occupied countries had two or more sections assigned to deal with politically disparate resistance movements. . For security purposes, each section had its own headquarters and training establishments. This strict compartmentalisation was so effective that in mid-1942 five governments in exile jointly suggested that a single sabotage organisation be created, and were startled to learn that SOE had been in existence for two years.     Four departments and some smaller groups were controlled by the director of scientific research, Professor  |Dudley_Maurice_Newitt|Dudley_Maurice_Newitt| , and were concerned with the development or acquisition and production of special equipment. A few other sections were involved with finance, security, economic research and administration, although SOE had no central registry or filing system. When Gubbins was appointed director, he formalised some of the administrative practices which had grown in an ad hoc fashion and appointed an establishment officer to oversee the manpower and other requirements of the various departments.     The main controlling body of SOE was its council, consisting of around fifteen heads of departments or sections. About half of the council were from the armed forces , the rest were various  |civil_servants|Her_Majestys_Civil_Service| , lawyers, or business or industrial experts. Most of the members of the council, and the senior officers and functionaries of SOE generally, were recruited by word of mouth among public school alumni and  |Oxbridge|Oxbridge|  graduates, although this did not notably affect SOEs political complexion.       Several subsidiary SOE headquarters and stations were set up to manage operations which were too distant for London to control directly. SOEs operations in the Middle East and  |Balkans|Balkans|  were controlled from a headquarters in  |Cairo|Cairo| , which was notorious for poor security, infighting and conflicts with other agencies. It finally became known in April 1944 as Special Operations , or SO. Shortly after the  |Allied_landings_in_North_Africa|Allied_Landings_In_North_Africa| , a station codenamed  Massingham  was established near  |Algiers|Algiers|  in late 1942, which operated into  |Southern_France|Southern_France| . Following the  |Allied_invasion_of_Italy|Allied_Invasion_Of_Italy| , personnel from Massingham established forward stations in  |Brindisi|Brindisi|  and near  |Naples|Naples| . A subsidiary headquarters initially known as Force 133 was later set up in  |Bari|Bari|  in  |Southern_Italy|Southern_Italy| , under the Cairo headquarters, to control operations in the Balkans and  |Northern_Italy|Northern_Italy| .     An SOE station, which was first called the India Mission, and was subsequently known as GS I was set up in  |India|British_India|  late in 1940. It subsequently moved to  |Ceylon|Sri_Lanka|  so as to be closer to the headquarters of the Allied  |South_East_Asia_Command|South_East_Asia_Command|  and became known as  |Force_136|Force_136| . A Singapore Mission was set up at the same time as the India Mission but was unable to overcome official opposition to its attempts to form resistance movements in  |Malaya|British_Malaya|  before the  |Japanese|Imperial_Japanese_Army|  overran  |Singapore|Battle_Of_Singapore| . Force 136 took over its surviving staff and operations.     New York City also had a branch office, formally titled  |British_Security_Coordination|British_Security_Coordination| , and headed by the Canadian businessman Sir  |William_Stephenson|William_Stephenson| . This office, located at Room 3603, 630  |Fifth_Avenue|Fifth_Avenue| ,  |Rockefeller_Center|Rockefeller_Center| , coordinated the work of SOE, SIS and MI5 with the American  |FBI|Federal_Bureau_Of_Investigation|  and  |Office_of_Strategic_Services|Office_Of_Strategic_Services| .       As with its leadership and organisation, the aims and objectives of SOE changed throughout the war, although they revolved around sabotaging and subverting the Axis war machines through indirect methods. SOE occasionally carried out operations with direct military objectives, such as  |Operation_Harling|Operation_Harling| , originally designed to cut one of the Axis supply lines to their troops fighting in North Africa. They also carried out some high-profile operations aimed mainly at the morale both of the Axis and occupied nations, such as  |Operation_Anthropoid|Operation_Anthropoid| , the assassination in Prague of  |Reinhard_Heydrich|Reinhard_Heydrich| . In general also, SOEs objectives were to foment mutual hatred between the population of Axis-occupied countries and the occupiers, and to force the Axis to expend manpower and resources on maintaining their control of subjugated populations.     Daltons early enthusiasm for fomenting widespread strikes, civil disobedience and nuisance sabotage in Axis-occupied areas had to be curbed. Thereafter, there were two main aims, often mutually incompatible; sabotage of the Axis war effort, and the creation of secret armies which would rise up to assist the liberation of their countries when Allied troops arrived or were about to do so. It was recognised that acts of sabotage would bring about reprisals and increased Axis security measures which would hamper the creation of underground armies. As the tide of war turned in the Allies favour, these underground armies became more important.       At the government level, SOEs relationships with the  |Foreign_Office|Foreign_Office|  were often difficult. On several occasions, various governments in exile protested at operations taking place without their knowledge or approval, provoking Axis  |reprisals|Reprisal|  against civilian populations, or complained about SOEs support for movements opposed to the exiled governments. SOEs activities also threatened relationships with neutral countries. SOE nevertheless generally adhered to the rule,  No bangs without Foreign Office approval.      Early attempts at bureaucratic control of Jefferiss MIR by the  |Ministry_of_Supply|Ministry_Of_Supply|  were eventually foiled by Churchills intervention. Thereafter, they co-operated, though at arms length, with Dudley Newitts various supply and development departments. The  |Treasury|Hm_Treasury|  were accommodating from the start and were often prepared to turn a blind eye to some of SOEs questionable activities.     With other military headquarters and commands, SOE cooperated fairly well with  |Combined_Operations_Headquarters|Combined_Operations_Headquarters|  during the middle years of the war, usually on technical matters as SOEs equipment was readily adopted by commandos and other raiders. This support was lost when  |Vice_Admiral|Vice_Admiral| |_Louis_Mountbatten|Louis_Mountbatten_1St_Earl_Mountbatten_Of_Burma|  left Combined Operations, though by this time SOE had its own transport and had no need to rely on Combined Operations for resources. On the other hand, the  |Admiralty|Admiralty|  objected to SOE developing its own underwater vessels, and the duplication of effort this involved. The Royal Air Force, and in particular  |RAF_Bomber_Command|Raf_Bomber_Command|  under  |_Bomber_Harris|Sir_Arthur_Harris_1St_Baronet|  were usually reluctant to allocate aircraft to SOE.     Towards the end of the war, as Allied forces began to liberate territories occupied by the Axis and in which SOE had established resistance forces, SOE also liaised with and to some extent came under the control of the Allied theatre commands. Relationships with  |Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force|Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force|  in north-west Europe  and  |South_East_Asia_Command|South_East_Asia_Command|  were generally excellent.  However, there were difficulties with the Commanders in Chief in the Mediterranean, partly because of the complaints over impropriety at SOEs Cairo headquarters during 1941 and partly because both the supreme command in the Mediterranean and SOEs establishments were split in 1942 and 1943, leading to divisions of responsibility and authority.     There was tension between SOE and SIS, which the Foreign Office controlled. Where SIS preferred placid conditions in which it could gather intelligence and work through influential persons or authorities, SOE was intended to create unrest and turbulence, and often backed anti-establishment organisations, such as the  |Communists|Communist| , in several countries. At one stage, SIS actively hindered SOEs attempts to infiltrate agents into  |enemy_occupied_France|German_Occupation_Of_France_During_World_War_Ii| .     Even before the United States joined the war, the head of the newly formed Office of the Coordinator of Information ,  |William_J_Donovan|William_J_Donovan| , had received technical information from SOE and had arranged for some members of his organisation to undergo training at a  |camp|Camp_X|  run by SOE in Oshawa in Canada. In early 1942, Donovans organisation became the  |Office_of_Strategic_Services|Office_Of_Strategic_Services| . SOE and OSS worked out respective areas of operation: OSSs exclusive sphere included China , Korea and Australia, the Atlantic islands and Finland. SOE retained India, the Middle East and East Africa, and the Balkans. While the two services both worked in Western Europe, it was expected that SOE would be the leading partner.     In the middle of the war, the relations between SOE and OSS were not often smooth. They established a joint headquarters in  |Algiers|Algiers|  but the officers of the two organisations working there refused to share information with each other. In the Balkans, and Yugoslavia especially, SOE and OSS several times worked at cross-purposes, reflecting their governments differing attitudes to the Partisans and Chetniks. However, in 1944 SOE and OSS successfully pooled their personnel and resources to mount  |Operation_Jedburgh|Operation_Jedburgh| , providing large scale support to the French Resistance following the  |Normandy_landings|Normandy_Landings| .     SOE had some nominal contact with the Soviet  |NKVD|Nkvd| , but this was limited to a single liaison officer at each others headquarters.                 After working from temporary offices in Central London, the headquarters of SOE was moved on 31 October 1940 into  |64_Baker_Street|64_Baker_Street|  . Ultimately, SOE occupied much of the western side of Baker Street. Baker Street became the euphemistic way of referring to SOE. The precise nature of the buildings remained concealed; it had no entry in the telephone directories, and correspondence to external bodies bore service addresses; MO1 , NID , AI10 , or other fictitious bodies or civilian companies.     SOE maintained a large number of training, research and development or administrative centres. It was a joke that  SOE  stood for  Stately omes of England , after the large number of country houses and estates it requisitioned and used.       The establishments connected with experimentation and production of equipment were mainly concentrated in and around  |Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire|  and were designated by roman numbers. The main weapons and devices research establishments were  |The_Firs|The_Firs_Whitchurch| , the home of MD1 near  |Aylesbury|Aylesbury|  in Buckinghamshire , and  |Station_IX|Station_Ix|  at  |The_Frythe|The_Frythe| , a country house outside  |Welwyn_Garden_City|Welwyn_Garden_City|  where, under the cover name of ISRB , SOE developed radios, weapons, explosive devices and  |booby_traps|Booby_Trap| .     Section D originally had a research station at  |Bletchley_Park|Bletchley_Park| , which also held the  |Government_Code_and_Cipher_School|Government_Communications_Headquarters| , until in November 1940 it was decided that it was unwise to conduct codebreaking and explosives experiments on the same site. The establishment moved to Aston House near  |Stevenage|Stevenage|  in Hertfordshire and was renamed  |Station_XII|Station_Xii| . It originally conducted research and development but from 1941 it became a production, storage and distribution centre for devices already developed.     Station XV, at the  |Thatched_Barn|Thatched_Barn|  near  |Borehamwood|Borehamwood| , was devoted to  |camouflage|Camouflage| , which usually meant equipping agents with authentic local clothing and personal effects. Various sub-stations in London were also involved in this task. Station XV and other camouflage sections also devised methods of hiding weapons, explosives or radios in innocuous-seeming items.     Agents also needed identity papers, ration cards, currency and so on. Station XIV, at  |Briggens_House|Briggens_House|  near  |Roydon|Roydon_Essex|  in Essex, was originally the home of STS38, a training facility for Polish saboteurs, which later became  |Manchester_Airport|Manchester_Airport| 2008 |rld_War_|Rld_War| 2008such as the former diplomat  |Fitzroy_Maclean|Sir_Fitzroy_Maclean_1St_Baronet|  or the classicist  |Christopher_Woodhouse|Montague_Woodhouse_5Th_Baron_Terrington| such as Frenchmen owing loyalty to  |Charles_de_Gaulle|Charles_De_Gaulle|  and especially the Polessome of whom taught skills such as picking locksFANYsuch as  |Pearl_Witherington|Pearl_Witherington| |so_known_as_the_B2_radio_s|So_Known_As_The_B2_Radio_S| specifically developed for SOE at Station IXand the Sten |ap|Ap| The term plastique comes from plastic explosive packaged by SOE and originally destined for France but taken to the United States instead.station IXaSRDlightweight binoculars with plastic lensesthe  Welbike  |Operation_Savanna|Operation_Savanna| |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd|  Bomber Harris Tempsford had been rejected for Bomber Commands purposes by Harris in March 1942, as it frequently became waterlogged.ten or more450 yards vs. 150 yardsIrregularand  |MI9|Mi9|  Operation Title and neutral Sweden |sistance_fighte|Sistance_Fighte| 1911–19931919–1944although not all of these belonged to SOEas opposed to clandestine4,000 tons had been dropped during the years before D-Dayexcept EU/P |F|F| nom de guerre Christine Granvillewith  |Andrzej_Kowerski|Andrzej_Kowerski| |rld_War_|Rld_War| mostly German executions of Polish civiliansformerSASmagazine |lgi|Lgi| |it|It| in Italy renamed No. 1 Special ForceBrigate GaribaldiOSS |goslav|Goslav| |itish_Army_offic|Itish_Army_Offic| László Veress |ücksbu|Ücksbu| later Brigadierthe  |Plaka|Plaka|  agreementfilm |litici|Litici| |39–19|39–19| STSNOR.I.C.1 |Operation_Autonomous|Operation_Autonomous| named  |Gideon_Force|Gideon_Force|  by Wingate |mbered_11157bottom_le|Mbered_11157Bottom_Le| |Japanese|Imperial_Japan| 1944–45 |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| |ited_Kingd|Ited_Kingd| who was generally known simply as C local resistance fighters and the agents of foreign governments who supported themand said agentsWorld War II .
