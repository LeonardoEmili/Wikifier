     The  |Eastern_Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| , like the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| , claims to be the  |One,_Holy,_Catholic_and_Apostolic_Church|Four_Marks_Of_The_Church| .     The term  |Western_Orthodoxy|Western_Orthodoxy|  is sometimes used to denominate what is technically a  |vicariate|Vicariate|  within the  |Antiochian_Orthodox|Antiochian_Eastern-Orthodox|  and the  |Russian_Orthodox_Church|Russian_Orthodox_Church| es and thus a part of the Eastern Orthodox Church as that term is defined here. The term Western Orthodox Church is disfavored by members of that vicariate.     In the 5th century,  |Oriental_Orthodoxy|Oriental_Orthodoxy|  separated from  |Chalcedonian_Christianity|Chalcedonian_Christianity|  , well before the 11th century  |Great_Schism|East-West_Schism| . It should not be confused with Eastern Orthodoxy.          The Orthodox Church is a  |communion|Full_Communion|  comprising the fourteen or sixteen separate  |autocephalous|Autocephaly|  hierarchical churches that recognize each other as canonical  |Orthodox_Christian|Eastern_Orthodoxy|  churches. Each constituent church is self-governing; its highest-ranking bishop reports to no higher earthly authority. Each regional church is composed of constituent eparchies ruled by bishops. Some autocephalous churches have given an eparchy or group of eparchies varying degrees of autonomy . Such autonomous churches maintain varying levels of dependence on their mother church, usually defined in a Tomos or other document of autonomy. In many cases, autonomous churches are almost completely self-governing, with the mother church retaining only the right to appoint the highest-ranking bishop of the autonomous church.     Normal governance is enacted through a  |synod|Synod|  of bishops within each church. In case of issues that go beyond the scope of a single church, multiple self-governing churches send representatives to a wider synod, sometimes wide enough to be called an Orthodox  |ecumenical_council|Ecumenical_Council|  . Such councils are deemed to have authority superior to that of any autocephalous church or its ranking bishop.     The Orthodox Church is decentralised, having no central authority, earthly head or a single  |Bishop|Bishop|  in a leadership role. Thus, the Orthodox Church uses a  |synod|Synod| ical system  |canonically|Canon_Law| , which is significantly different from the hierarchically organised Catholic Church that follows the doctrine of  |papal_supremacy|Papal_Supremacy| .
