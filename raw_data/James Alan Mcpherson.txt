At the time of his death, McPherson was a  |professor_emeritus|Professor_Emeritus|  of fiction at the  |Iowa_Writers_Workshop|Iowa_Writers_Workshop| .            McPherson was born in  |Savannah,_Georgia|Savannah,_Georgia| , on September 16, 1943, the second of four children.  His father was a  |master_electrician|Master_Electrician|  , Henry, DeWitt  and his mother was a maid. While McPherson was growing up, his father struggled with alcohol and time in jail. In the essay Going Up To Atlanta, McPherson describes the many odd jobs he took on during this time to help support his mother, brother, and sisters. But it was his discovery of the colored branch of the public library that changed his life. When he started reading books, McPherson learned that words, even without pictures, gave up their secret meanings, spoke of other worlds, made me know that pain was a part of other peoples lives.     He attended  |Morgan_State_University|Morgan_State_University|  from 1963 to 1964 before receiving his undergraduate degree in history and English from  |Morris_Brown_College|Morris_Brown_College|  in 1965.  In 1968, McPherson received a  |LL.B.|Ll.B.|  from  |Harvard_Law_School|Harvard_Law_School| , where he partially financed his studies by working as a janitor.     While at Harvard, McPherson studied fiction writing with Alan Lebowitz in 1967 and worked on his stories when he found some spare time. It was the publication of his short story Gold Coast in  The Atlantic Monthly , following an open reading competition they had sponsored, that first brought him public recognition. During this period, McPherson established a close working relationship with Edward Weeks, an editor at The Atlantic Monthly, which led to McPherson becoming a contributing editor at that magazine in 1969. His fiction would go on to appear in numerous journals and magazines throughout the following decade. Many of his stories were anthologized, beginning with Gold Coast when it appeared in  The Best American Stories  in 1969. His first collection of short stories, Hue and Cry, was published by Atlantic Monthly Press that year.     In 1971, he received an  |M.F.A.|Master_Of_Fine_Arts|  in fiction from the Iowa Writers Workshop, where he studied briefly with the short-story writer and novelist  |Richard_Yates|Richard_Yates| . While studying creative writing, McPherson decided not to practice law; however, he would continue to utilize his legal training in various projects. In a 1972 Atlantic Monthly essay, he exposed exploitative business practices against black homeowners, presaging the later work of  |Ta-Nehisi_Coates|Ta-Nehisi_Coates| .      During this period in his life, he gained the attention of  |Ralph_Ellison|Ralph_Ellison|  , who became both a friend and mentor to the young McPherson. In December 1970, McPherson interviewed Ellison for an Atlantic Monthly cover story and collaborated with him on the essay Indivisible Man. This relationship with Ellison would have a lasting influence on his own life and work, as McPherson acknowledges in his essay Gravitas, which he published in 1999 as both a tribute to the recently deceased writer, and to observe the posthumous publication of Ellisons novel  Juneteenth  that same year.  McPherson also initiated a friendship with  |Albert_Murray|Albert_Murray|  shortly after the publication of Murrays The Omni-Americans: Black Experience & American Culture .          McPherson taught English and creative writing at the  |University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz|University_Of_California,_Santa_Cruz|  , the  |Harvard_University|Harvard_University|  summer school , Morgan State University and the  |University_of_Virginia|University_Of_Virginia|  before joining the Iowa Writers Workshop in 1981,  with whom he was associated for the remainder of his life. He served as acting director of the program for two years following the death of  |Frank_Conroy|Frank_Conroy|  in 2005. Following the publication of  Elbow Room  in 1977, McPherson primarily focused on his teaching career, with the  Chicago Tribune  characterizing him as being only slightly more gregarious than  |J.D._Salinger|J.D._Salinger| .     He was also a visiting scholar at  |Yale_Law_School|Yale_Law_School|  and a fellow at  |Stanford_Universitys|Stanford_University| |Center_for_Advanced_Study_in_the_Behavioral_Sciences|Center_For_Advanced_Study_In_The_Behavioral_Sciences|  . Significantly, McPherson lectured in  |Japan|Japan|  , a country whose society and culture profoundly affected him.  It was in Japan, he once wrote, where he went to lay down the burden carried by all black Americans, especially the males.     Crabcakes: A Memoir, his first original work since Elbow Room, was published in 1998. His final book  was published in 2000.       In 1972, McPherson was awarded a  |Guggenheim_Fellowship|Guggenheim_Fellowship| .
