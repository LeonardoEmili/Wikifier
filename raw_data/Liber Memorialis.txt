The Liber Memorialis is an ancient book in  |Latin|Latin|  featuring an extremely concise summary  a kind of index  of  |universal_history|Universal_History|  from earliest times to the reign of  |Trajan|Trajan| . It was written by  |Lucius_Ampelius|Lucius_Ampelius| , who was possibly a tutor or schoolmaster.       The book is dedicated to a Macrinus, who may have been the  |emperor|Macrinus|  who reigned 217–218, but that name was not uncommon, and it seems more likely he was simply a young man with a thirst for universal knowledge, which the book was compiled to satisfy.     The books object and scope are indicated in its dedication:        The Liber Memorialis seems to have been intended as a  |textbook|Textbook|  to be learned by heart. This little work, in fifty chapters, gives a sketch of  |cosmography|Cosmography| ,  |geography|Geography| ,  |mythology|Mythology|  , and history . The historical portion, dealing mainly with the  |republican|Roman_Republic|  period, is untrustworthy and the text in many places corrupt; the earlier chapters are more valuable, and contain some interesting information.     Chapter VIII  contains the following, the only reference by an ancient writer to the famous sculptures of the  |Pergamon_Altar|Pergamon_Altar| , which were discovered in 1871, excavated in 1878, and are now in  |Berlin|Berlin|        Nothing is known of the date at which the work was written; the times of Trajan,  |Hadrian|Hadrian| ,  |Antoninus_Pius|Antoninus_Pius| , the beginning of the 3rd century have all been suggested. However, in Chapter V De Orbe Terrarum , Ampelius refers to the Tigris and Euphrates in Parthia, which suggests that Ampelius wrote before the  |Sassanians|Sassanians|  overthrew the Parthians in 224.       The first edition of the Liber Memorialis was published in 1638 by  |Claudius_Salmasius|Claudius_Salmasius|  from the Dijon manuscript, now lost, together with the Epitome of  |Florus|Florus| . An 1873 edition by Wölfflin was based on Salmasiuss copy of the lost codex. The more recent editions are   Erwin Assmanns  |Teubner|Teubner|  edition of 1935   Nicola Terzaghis edition, published by Chiantore in Turin ca. 1947   Marie-Pierre Arnaud-Lidets 1993 edition for the  |Collection_Budé|Collection_Budé|            .
