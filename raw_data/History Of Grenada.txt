The recorded history of the Caribbean island of Grenada begins in the early 17th century. First settled by  |indigenous_peoples|Indigenous_People_Of_The_Americas| , by the time of European contact it was inhabited by the  |Caribs|Island_Caribs| .  |British_colonists|British_Colonization_Of_The_Americas|  drove most of the Caribs off the island and established  |plantations|Sugar_Plantations_In_The_Caribbean|  on the island, eventually importing  |African_slaves|African_Slave_Trade|  to work on the sugar plantations.     Control of the island was disputed by  |Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain|  and France in the 18th century, with the British ultimately prevailing. In 1795,  |Fédons_Rebellion|Fédons_Rebellion| , inspired by the  |Haitian_Revolution|Haitian_Revolution| , very nearly succeeded, taking significant military intervention to quell. Slavery was abolished in 1833, and in 1885, the islands capital,  |St._Georges|St._Georges,_Grenada| , became the capital of the  |British_Windward_Islands|British_Windward_Islands| .      |Grenada|Grenada|  achieved independence from Britain in 1974. Following a coup by the Marxist  |New_Jewel_Movement|New_Jewel_Movement|  in 1983, the island  |was_invaded|Invasion_Of_Grenada|  by  |United_States|United_States|  troops and the government overthrown. The islands major crop,  |nutmeg|Nutmeg| , was significantly damaged by  |Hurricane_Ivan|Hurricane_Ivan|  in 2004.          About 2 million years ago,  |Grenada|Grenada|  was formed as an underwater volcano.     The earliest potential evidence for human presence on Grenada comes from the increase of charcoal particulates and the decline of arboreal pollen from the original climax forests, around 3760-3525 BC,  during the  |Archaic_Age|Ortoiroid_People| . This evidence remains controversial, as it could be natural . Several shell fragments from  |archaeological|Archaeology|  sites have been dated 1700-1380 BC, but are from mixed, insecure contexts.  More secure are the shell middens at Point Salines, dated between 765-535 BC. None of these dates are associated with definitively human artifacts, however. The earliest human-made artifacts that have been scientifically dated are from  |Early_Ceramic_Age|Saladoid|  settlements at Beausejour and Pearls  .
