        ", Walter Donlan, and Jennifer Tolbert Roberts have written, Plutarch was influenced by histories written after the decline of Sparta and marked by nostalgia for a happier past, real or imagined. Turning to Plutarch himself, they write, the admiration writers like Plutarch and Xenophon felt for Spartan society led them to exaggerate its monolithic nature, minimizing departures from ideals of equality and obscuring patterns of historical change. Thus the Spartan egalitarianism and superhuman immunity to pain that have seized the popular imagination are likely myths, and their main architect is Plutarch. While flawed, Plutarch is nonetheless indispensable as one of the only ancient sources of information on Spartan life. Pomeroy et al. conclude that Plutarchs works on Sparta, while they must be treated with skepticism, remain valuable for their large quantities of information and these historians concede that Plutarchs writings on Sparta, more than those of any other ancient author, have shaped later views of Sparta , despite their potential to misinform.

According to Plutarch scholar R. H.
