                 The Knights of Columbus is the worlds largest  |Catholic|Catholic_Church| |_fraternal_service_organization|Fraternal_And_Service_Organizations| .  Founded in 1882 by  |Michael_J_McGivney|Michael_J_Mcgivney|  in  |New_Haven_Connecticut|New_Haven_Connecticut| , it was named in honor of  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus| . Originally serving as a  |mutual_benefit_society|Friendly_Society|  to working-class and immigrant Catholics in the United States, it developed into a fraternal benefit society dedicated to providing charitable services, including war and disaster relief, actively defending Catholicism in various nations, and promoting  |Catholic_education|Catholic_Education| .  The Knights also support the Catholic Churchs  |positions_on_public_policy_issues|Catholic_Social_Teaching| , including  |various_political_causes|Political_Activity_Of_The_Knights_Of_Columbus| , and are participants in the  |new_evangelization|New_Evangelization| . The current  |Supreme_Knight|Supreme_Knight_Of_The_Knights_Of_Columbus|  is  |Carl_A_Anderson|Carl_A_Anderson| .     As of 2019, there are nearly 2 million members around the world. Membership is limited to practicing Catholic men aged 18 or older. The order consists of four different degrees, each exemplifying a different principle of the order. The are more than 16,000 councils around the world, including over 300 on college campuses. The Knights official junior organization is known as the  |Columbian_Squires|Columbian_Squires|  and the orders patriotic arm is the Fourth Degree.     In 2018, the Knights gave US$185 million directly to charity and performed over 76 million  |man_hours|Man_Hour|  of voluntary service.  The origanization also provides certain financial services to affiliated groups and individuals.                       |Michael_J_McGivney|Michael_J_Mcgivney| , an Irish-American Catholic priest, founded the Knights of Columbus, with a group of men from  |St_Marys_Parish|St_Marys_Church| ,  incorporating it on March 29, 1882. Although its was initially based in Connecticut, it later expanded throughout the United States.      The order was intended to be a  |mutual_benefit_society|Benefit_Society| . As a parish priest in an immigrant community, McGivney wanted to provide insurance to care for families that faced unforseen hardship. At that time, Roman Catholics were frequently excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services.     The original insurance system devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knights widow a $1,000 death benefit, funded by a pro-rata contribution from the membership.  There was also a Sick Benefit for members who fell ill and could not work.     From the earliest days of the order, members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members. About 1,400 members attended the first exemplification of the Fourth Degree at the Lenox Lyceum in New York on February 22, 1900.       From the entry of the United States into  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  the Knights supported the war effort and the troops. It was hoped that this would help mitigate some of the  |American_anti_Catholicism|Anti_Catholicism_In_The_United_States| . Supreme Knight  |James_A_Flaherty|James_A_Flaherty|  proposed to US President Woodrow Wilson that the order establish soldiers welfare centers in the US and abroad. The organization already had experience, having provided similar services to troops encamped on the Mexican border during  |Pershings|John_J_Pershing|  expedition of 1916. With the slogan Everyone Welcome, Everything Free, the huts became recreation/service centers for doughboys regardless of race or religion. They were staffed by secretaries , commonly referred to as Caseys who were generally men above the age of military service. The centers provided basic amenities not readily available, such as stationery, hot baths, and religious services.     The war effort gave the order a framework and the experience needed to meet larger needs in both the church and in society. Kauffman viewed the experience as being symbolic of the American church as a whole growing from a poor immigrant society to one that was well established and respected in the United States. After the war, the Knights became involved in education, occupational training, and employment programs for the returning troops.     During the  |nadir_of_American_race_relations|Nadir_Of_American_Race_Relations| , a bogus oath was circulated claiming that Fourth Degree Knights swore to exterminate  |Freemasons|Freemasonry|  and  |Protestants|Protestantism| . The  |Ku_Klux_Klan|Ku_Klux_Klan|  , which was growing into a newly powerful force through the 1920s, spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their contemporary campaign against Catholics. Numerous state councils and the Supreme Council believed publication would stop if the KKK were assessed fines or punished by jail time assessed and began suing distributors for  |libel|Libel| . As a result, the KKK ended its publication of the false oath. As the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit , it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders.        After World War I, many Americans had concerns about the assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values; they wanted public schools to teach children to be American. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the  |Oregon_Compulsory_Education_Act|Oregon_Compulsory_Education_Act| . The law was primarily aimed at eliminating  |parochial_schools|Parochial_School| , including Catholic schools. The Compulsory Education Act required almost all children in Oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend  |public_school|Public_School|  by 1926.  |Roger_Nash_Baldwin|Roger_Nash_Baldwin| , an associate director of the  |American_Civil_Liberties_Union|American_Civil_Liberties_Union|  and a personal friend of then-Supreme Advocate and future Supreme Knight  |Luke_E_Hart|Luke_E_Hart| , offered to join forces with the order to challenge the law. The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it. The case became known as  Pierce v. Society of Sisters  and in a unanimous decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best.     Postwar social unrest was also related to the difficulties of absorbing the veterans from the war in the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing  |anti_Semitism_in_the_United_States|Anti_Semitism_In_The_United_States|  related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. To combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities, including Catholics, the order formed a historical commission which published a series of books on their contributions, among other activities. The Knights of Columbus Racial Contributions Series of books included three titles: The Gift of Black Folk, by  |W_E_B_Du_Bois|W_Nbsp_E_Nbsp_B_Du_Bois| , The Jews in the Making of America by George Cohen, and The Germans in the Making of America by Frederick Schrader.          Today, according to  |Massimo_Faggioli|Massimo_Faggioli| , the Knights of Columbus are an extreme version of a post–Vatican II phenomenon, the rise of discrete lay groups that have become centers of power themselves. As the order and its charitable works grew, so did its prominence within the church. The Supreme Board of Directors was invited to hold their April meeting at the  |Vatican|Holy_See|  in 1978, and the board and their wives were received by  |Pope_Paul_VI|Pope_Paul_Vi| .  |Pope_John_Paul_Is|Pope_John_Paul_I|  first audience with a layman was with Supreme Knight Dechant, and  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii|  met with Dechant three days after his installation.     John Paul traveled to the  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic|  and Mexico in 1978 and Dechant was invited to attend and welcome the Pope to the Americas. During the popes 1979 visit to the United States, the Supreme Officers and Board were the only lay organization to receive an audience.     In 1997, the cause for McGivneys  |canonization|Canonization|  was opened in the  |Archdiocese_of_Hartford|Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_Of_Hartford| . It was placed before the  |Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints|Congregation_For_The_Causes_Of_Saints|  in 2000. The Father Michael J. McGivney Guild was formed in 1997 to promote his cause, and it currently has more than 140,000 members. Membership in the Knights of Columbus does not automatically make one a member of the guild, nor is membership restricted to Knights; members must elect to join. On March 15, 2008,  |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  approved a decree recognizing McGivneys heroic virtue, significantly advancing the priests process toward sainthood. McGivney may now be referred to as the  |Venerable|Venerableroman_Catholic|  Servant of God. If the cause is successful, he would be the first priest born in the United States to be canonized as a  |saint|Saint| .       The order is dedicated to the principles of charity, unity, fraternity, and patriotism. A First Degree exemplification ceremony, by which a man joins the order, explicates the virtue of charity. He is said to be a First-Degree Knight of Columbus; after participating in the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, he rises to that status. Upon reaching the Third Degree, a gentleman is a full member. Priests do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as laymen do, but rather take the degree by observation.     The first ritual handbook, printed in 1885, contained only sections teaching unity and charity. Supreme Knight Mullen, along with primary ritual author Daniel Colwell, believed that the initiation ceremony should be held in three sections in accord with the Trinity of Virtues, Charity, Unity, and Brotherly love.  The third section, expounding fraternity, was officially adopted in 1891.            After taking their third degree, knights are eligible to receive their fourth degree, the primary purpose of which is to foster the spirit of  |patriotism|Patriotism|  and to encourage active Catholic citizenship. Fourth degree members, in addition to being members of their individual councils, are also members of Fourth-Degree assemblies which typically comprise members of several councils.     A new Military Overseas Europe Special District was established in 2013. Over 100 Department of Defense civilian employees and active-duty personnel based in Germany, Italy, and Britain took part in a special Fourth Degree Exemplification Ceremony at  |Ramstein_Air_Force_Base|Ramstein_Air_Force_Base|  in Germany in 2013. In that year exemplifications were also held in  |Camp_Zama|Camp_Zama| , Japan, and  |Yongsan_Garrison|Yongsan_Garrison|  in Seoul, Korea, where there are existing assemblies.       Fourth Degree Knights may optionally purchase and wear the full regalia and join an assemblys Color Corps. The Color Corps is the most visible arm of the Knights, as they are often seen in parades and other local events. Official dress for the Color Corps is a blue blazer with the emblem as a patch and on the buttons, a white shirt, a Fourth Degree tie, dark gray slacks and a  |beret|Beret|  with the emblem.  In warm climates and during warm months, a white dinner jacket may be worn, if done as a unit.     Baldrics are worn from the right shoulder to left hip and are color specific by nation. In the United States, Panama, and the Philippines, baldrics are red, white, and blue. Red and white baldrics are used in Canada and Poland; red, white, and green in Mexico; and blue and white in Guatemala. Service baldrics include a scabbard for a  |sword|Sword|  and are worn over the coat while social baldrics are worn under the coat. Faithful navigators and past faithful navigators are permitted to carry a white handled silver sword. Masters and vice supreme masters, as well as former masters and former vice supreme masters, are also denoted by their gold swords.                 Charity is the foremost principle of the Knights of Columbus. According to one commentator, there is hardly a corner of the Catholic world where the resources of this international force have not left an impression. This has allowed the Knights and its high-ranking officers to become powerful and influential in ways unimaginable in 1882  ... and no other lay group can match the Knights ability to leave its mark on the church.     In 2018, the order gave more than $185  million directly to charity and performed over 76  million man hours in volunteer service. According to  |Independent_Sector|Independent_Sector| , this service has a value of more than $1.7  billion. The total charitable contributions from the decade ending December 31, 2015 rose to $15  billion. On average in 2015, each Knight of Columbus contributed 38 hours of community service. Much of the financial effort went to initiatives of the Vatican and the US bishops.     United in Charity, a general, unrestricted  |endowment_fund|Endowment_Fund| , was introduced at the 2004 Supreme Council meeting to support and ensure the overall long-term charitable and philanthropic goals of the order. The fund is wholly managed, maintained, and operated by Knights of Columbus Charities, Inc., a  |501|501|  charitable organization. Before United in Charity was formed, all requests for funds were met with the general funds of the order or in combination with specific appeals.            The original insurance system devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knights widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, and when the number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks . If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.     The need for a reserve fund for times of epidemic was seen from the earliest days, but it was rejected several times before finally being established in 1892. It had $12,000 in assets in 1896. By 1897, the method of funding the program changed. Each member was assessed five cents a month for 100 months, so that he would contribute $5.     Since its first loan to St. Rose Church in  |Meriden_Connecticut|Meriden_Connecticut| , in the late 1890s, the Knights of Columbus have made loans to parishes, dioceses, and other Catholic institutions. By 1954, over $300  million had been loaned and the program never lost one cent of principal or interest.      In the post– |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  era, the interest rates on long-term bonds dipped below levels at which the orders insurance program could sustain itself, and Supreme Knight Hart moved the order into a more aggressive program of investing in real estate. Under his leadership, the order established a lease-back investment program in which the order would buy a piece of property and then lease it back to the original owner upon terms generally that would bring to our Order a net rental equal to the normal mortgage interest rate.      Late in 1953 it was learned that the land upon which  |Yankee_Stadium|Yankee_Stadium|  was built was for sale. On December 17, 1953, the order purchased the property for $2.5  million and then leased it back for 28 years at $182,000 a year with the option to renew the lease for three additional terms of 15 years at $125,000 a year. In 1971 the  |City_of_New_York|City_Of_New_York|  took the land by  |eminent_domain|Eminent_Domain| .     Between 1952 and 1962, 18 pieces of land were purchased as part of the lease-back program for a total of $29  million. During this time, the amount of money invested in common stock also increased.          The order offers a modern, professional insurance operation with more than $100  billion of life insurance policies in force and $19.8  billion in assets , a figure more than double the 2000 levels. Nearly 80,000 life certificates were issued in 2013, almost 30,000 more than the orders closest competitor, to bring the total to 1.73  million. In 2012, the program had a $1.8  billion surplus. By 2017, the annual surplus grew to $2.1 billion.     Over $286  million in death benefits were paid in 2012 and $1.7  billion were paid between 2000 and 2010. This is large enough to rank 49th on the  |A_M_Best|A_Nbsp_M_Best|  list of all life insurance companies in North America. Since the founding of the order, $3.5  billion in death benefits have been paid. Premiums in 2012 were nearly $1.2  billion, and dividends paid out totaled more than $274  million. Over the same time period, annuity deposits rose 4.2 percent, compared to an 8 percent loss for the industry as a whole.     Every day in 2012 more than $10  million was invested, for a total of $2.7  billion on the year, and an annual income of $905  million. The order maintains a two-prong investment strategy: a company must first be a sound investment before stock in it is purchased, and secondly the companys activities must not conflict with  |Catholic_social_teaching|Catholic_Social_Teaching| . Citing the awards they have won, the order calls themselves champions of ethical investing. The order also provides mortgages to churches and Catholic schools at very competitive rates through its ChurchLoan program.     Products include  |permanent|Permanent_Life_Insurance|  and  |term_life_insurance|Term_Life_Insurance| , as well as  |annuities|Annuity| ,  |long_term_care_insurance|Long_Term_Care_Insurance| , and  |disability_insurance|Disability_Insurance| . The insurance program is not a separate business offered by the order to others but is exclusively for the benefit of members and their families. According to the  |Fortune_1000|Fortune_1000|  list, the Knights of Columbus ranked 880 in total revenue in 2017  and, with more than 1,500 agents, was 925th in size in 2015. All agents are members of the order.     The orders insurance program is the most highly rated program in North America. For 40 consecutive years, the order has received A.  M. Bests highest rating, A++. Additionally, the order is certified by the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association for ethical sales practices. Standard & Poors downgraded the insurance programs financial strength/credit rating from AAA to AA+ in August 2011 not due to the orders financial strength, but due to its lowering of the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States to AA+.  Additionally, the insurance program has a low 3.5 percent lapse rate of the 1.9  million members and their families who are insured.
