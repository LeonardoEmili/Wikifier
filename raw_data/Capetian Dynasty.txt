           The Capetian dynasty , also known as the  |House_of_France|House_Of_France| , is a  |dynasty|Dynasty|  of  |Frankish|Franks|  origin, and a branch of the  |Robertians|Robertians| . It is among the largest and oldest  |royal_houses|Dynasty|  in Europe and the world, and consists of  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet| , the founder of the dynasty, and his male-line descendants, who ruled in France without interruption from 987 to 1792, and again from 1814 to 1848. The senior line ruled in France as the  |House_of_Capet|House_Of_Capet|  from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of  |Charles_IV|Charles_Iv_Of_France|  in 1328. That line was succeeded by  |cadet_branch|Cadet_Branch| es, the Houses of  |Valois|House_Of_Valois|  and then  |Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon| , which ruled without interruption until the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  abolished the monarchy in 1792. The Bourbons were restored in 1814 in the aftermath of  |Napoleons|Napoleon|  defeat, but had to vacate the throne again in 1830 in favor of the last Capetian monarch of France,  |Louis_Philippe_I|Louis_Philippe_I| , who belonged to the  |House_of_Orléans|House_Of_Orléans| .     The dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. Initially obeyed only in their own  |demesne|Demesne| , the  |Île-de-France|Île-De-France| , the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see  Crown lands of France .     Members of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic, and the early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader Kings –  |Louis_VII|Louis_Vii_Of_France| ,  |Philip_Augustus|Philip_Ii_Of_France| ,  |Louis_VIII|Louis_Viii_Of_France| ,  |Saint_Louis|Louis_Ix_Of_France| , and  |Philip_III|Philip_Iii_Of_France| . The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the  |Aragonese_Crusade|Aragonese_Crusade| . Philip IIIs son and successor,  |Philip_IV|Philip_Iv_Of_France| , humiliated a pope and brought the  |papacy_under_French_control|Avignon_Papacy| . The later Valois, starting with  |Francis_I|Francis_I_Of_France| , ignored religious differences and  |allied|Franco-Ottoman_Alliance|  with the  |Ottoman_Sultan|Ottoman_Sultanate|  to counter the growing power of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| .  |Henry_IV|Henry_Iv_Of_France|  was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.     The Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the King of France are given  |appanages|Appanage|  for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. As a result, the Capetians have reigned at different times in the kingdoms of  |Spain|Kingdom_Of_Spain| ,  |Poland|Kingdom_Of_Poland| ,  |Aragon|Kingdom_Of_Aragon| ,  |Portugal|Kingdom_Of_Portugal| ,  |Navarre|Kingdom_Of_Navarre| , and as Emperors of the  |Latin_Empire|Latin_Empire| .     In modern times, King  |Felipe_VI_of_Spain|Felipe_Vi_Of_Spain|  is a member of this family, while Grand Duke  |Henri_of_Luxembourg|Henri,_Grand_Duke_Of_Luxembourg|  is of relation to the family by  |agnatic_kinship|Agnatic_Kinship| ; both through the  |Bourbon_branch|House_Of_Bourbon|  of the dynasty. Along with the  |House_of_Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg| , it was one of the two most powerful  |continental_Europe|Continental_Europe| an royal families, dominating European politics for nearly five centuries.       The name of the dynasty derives from its founder,  |Hugh|Hugh_Capet_Of_France| , who was known as Hugh Capet . The meaning of Capet is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with cape , other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word caput , and explain it as meaning chief or head .     Historians in the 19th century  came to apply the name Capetian to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name Capet has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the  |House_of_Capet|House_Of_Capet| . One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned  |King_Louis_XVI|King_Louis_Xvi|   and  |Queen_Marie_Antoinette|Marie_Antoinette_Of_Austria|   were referred to as Louis and Antoinette Capet .          The Capetian Miracle  refers to the dynastys ability to attain and hold onto the French crown.      In 987,  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet|  was elected to succeed  |Louis_V|Louis_V_Of_France|  of the  |Carolingian|Carolingian|  dynasty that had ruled France for over three centuries. By a process of associating elder sons with them in the kingship, the early Capetians established the hereditary succession in their family and transformed a theoretically electoral kingship to a sacral one. By the time of  |Philip_II_Augustus|Philip_Ii_Augustus| , who became king in 1180, the Capetian hold on power was so strong that the practice of associate kingship was dropped. While the Capetian monarchy began as one of the weakest in Europe, drastically eclipsed by the new Anglo-Norman realm in England  and even other  |great_lords_of_France|Peerage_Of_France| , the political value of orderly succession in the Middle Ages cannot be overstated. The orderly succession of power from father to son over such a long period of time meant that the French monarchs, who originally were essentially just the direct rulers of the  |Île-de-France|Île-De-France| , were able to preserve and extend their power, while over the course of centuries the great peers of the realm would eventually lose their power in one succession crisis or another.     By comparison, the Crusader  |Kingdom_of_Jerusalem|Kingdom_Of_Jerusalem|  was constantly beset with internal succession disputes because each generation only produced female heirs. Even the English monarchy encountered severe succession crises, such as  |The_Anarchy|The_Anarchy|  of the 1120s between Stephen and Matilda, and the murder of  |Arthur_I,_Duke_of_Brittany|Arthur_I,_Duke_Of_Brittany| , the primogeniture heir of  |Richard_I_of_England|Richard_I_Of_England| . The latter case would deal a severe blow to the prestige of  |King_John|John_Of_England| , leading to the eventual destruction of Angevin hegemony in France. In contrast, the French kings were able to maintain uncontested father-to-son succession from the time of Hugh Capet until the succession crisis which began the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War|  of the 14th century.                The dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capets family prior to his election as King of France is Robertians or Robertines. The name is derived from the familys first certain ancestor,  |Robert_the_Strong|Robert_The_Strong|  , the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of  |Robert_III_of_Worms|Robert_Iii_Of_Worms|  and grandson of  |Robert_of_Hesbaye|Robert_Of_Hesbaye|  . The Robertians probably originated in the county  |Hesbaye|Hesbaye| , around  |Tongeren|Tongeren|  in modern-day Belgium.     The sons of Robert the Strong were  |Odo|Odo_Of_France|  and  |Robert|Robert_I_Of_France| , who both ruled as king of  |Western_Francia|Western_Francia| . The family became  |Counts_of_Paris|Count_Of_Paris|  under Odo and Dukes of the  |Franks|Franks|  under Robert, possessing large parts of  |Neustria|Neustria| .     The Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of  |Louis_V|Louis_V_Of_France| . After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great,  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet| , was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at  |Noyon|Noyon|  on 3 July 987 with the full support from  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| |Otto_III|Otto_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| . With Hughs coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the Capetians, with the Capetian dynasty and its cadet branches such as the  |House_of_Valois|House_Of_Valois|  ruling France for more than 800 years .       Rodbert    |Ingerman_of_Hesbaye|Ingerman_Of_Hesbaye| |Ermengarde_of_Hesbaye|Ermengarde_Of_Hesbaye| , wife of  |Louis_the_Pious|Louis_The_Pious| |Cancor|Cancor| , founder of the  |Lorsch_Abbey|Lorsch_Abbey| |Lahngau|Lahngau| |Poppo_of_Grapfeld|Poppo_Of_Grapfeld|  , ancestor of the Frankish  |House_of_Babenberg|House_Of_Babenberg| |Saint_Chrodogang|Chrodegang_Of_Metz| , Archbishop of Metz, Abbot of the  |Lorsch_Abbey|Lorsch_Abbey| |Robert_of_Hesbaye|Robert_Of_Hesbaye| |Robert_III_of_Worms|Robert_Iii_Of_Worms| |Robert_the_Strong|Robert_The_Strong| |Odo|Odo_Of_France| , king of  |Western_Francia|Western_Francia| |Robert|Robert_I_Of_France| , king of  |Western_Francia|Western_Francia| |Emma|Emma_Of_France| , married  |Rudolph_of_Burgundy|Rudolph,_Duke_Of_Burgundy| |Herbert_II,_Count_of_Vermandois|Herbert_Ii,_Count_Of_Vermandois| |Hugh_the_Great|Hugh_The_Great| |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet| , founder House of Capet    |Hadwig|Hedwig_Of_France| , married  |Reginar_IV,_Count_of_Mons|Reginar_Iv,_Count_Of_Mons| |Robert_II|Robert_Ii_Of_France| |Frederick_of_Bar|Frederick_I,_Duke_Of_Upper_Lorraine| |Richard_I_of_Normandy|Richard_I_Of_Normandy| |Herbert|Herbert_Of_Selkirk| , bishop of  |Auxerre|Auxerre|           Over the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from  |kingdoms|Monarchy|  to  |manors|Manorialism| .        |Salic_law|Salic_Law| , reestablished during the  |Hundred_Years_War|Hundred_Years_War|  from an ancient  |Frankish|Salian_Franks|  tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male  descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.     Without Salic law, upon the death of  |John_I|John_I_Of_France| , the crown would have passed to his half-sister,  |Joan|Joan_Ii_Of_Navarre|  . However, Joans paternity was suspect due to her mothers adultery in the  |Tour_de_Nesle_Affair|Tour_De_Nesle_Affair| ; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.     In 1328, King  |Charles_IV_of_France|Charles_Iv_Of_France|  died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him.  |Philip_of_Valois|Philip_Vi_Of_France| , the late kings first cousin acted as regent, pending the birth of the kings posthumous child, which proved to be a girl.  |Isabella_of_France|Isabella_Of_France| , sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son,  |Edward_III_of_England|Edward_Iii_Of_England| . The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females, but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.     Thus the French crown passed from the  |House_of_Capet|House_Of_Capet|  after the death of  |Charles_IV|Charles_Iv_Of_France|  to  |Philip_VI_of_France|Philip_Vi_Of_France|  of the  |House_of_Valois|House_Of_Valois| , a  |cadet_branch|Cadet_Branch|  of the Capetian dynasty,   then to Louis II, Duke of Orléans, of the Orléans branch of the Valois, who became  |Louis_XII_of_France|Louis_Xii_Of_France| ,   then to Francis, Duke of Valois, Count of Angoulème, who became  |Francis_I_of_France|Francis_I_Of_France| , and his descendants, of the Orléans-Angoulème,   then to Henry III of Navarre, who became  |Henry_IV_of_France|Henry_Iv_Of_France| , of the  |House_of_Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon| , a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.     This did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain,  |Navarre|Navarre| , and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available  |below|Senior_Capets| .       The Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most. This list of cadet branches shows most of the Capetian cadet lines and designating their royal French progenitor, although some sub-branches are not shown.       |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet|

Jaime Álvares Pereira de Melo, 10th Duke of Cadaval       Throughout most of history, the Senior Capet and the  |King_of_France|King_Of_France|  were synonymous terms. Only in the time before  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet|  took the crown for himself and after the reign of  |Charles_X|Charles_X_Of_France|  is the term necessary to identify which. However, since primogeniture and the  |Salic_law|Salic_Law|  provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the predecessors of the French monarchy, all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the  |Legitimist|Legitimist|  pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign. It is important to note that historians class the predecessors of Hugh Capet as Robertians, not Capetians.

Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven  |pretenders|Pretender|  represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is  |Louis-Alphonse_de_Bourbon|Louis_Alphonse,_Duke_Of_Anjou| , known by his supporters as  |Duke_of_Anjou|Duke_Of_Anjou| , who also holds the  |Legitimist|Legitimist|   claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.     Except for the  |House_of_Braganza|House_Of_Braganza|  , all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.        |Henri|Henri_Of_Luxembourg| ,  |Grand_Duke_of_Luxembourg|Grand_Duke_Of_Luxembourg| |Felipe_VI|Felipe_Vi_Of_Spain| ,  |King_of_Spain|King_Of_Spain| |Louis_Alphonse,_Duke_of_Anjou|Louis_Alphonse,_Duke_Of_Anjou| ,  |Legitimist|Legitimist|   pretender to France since 1989.    |Prince_Pedro,_Duke_of_Calabria|Prince_Pedro,_Duke_Of_Calabria| , Calabrian pretender to the  |Two_Sicilies|Two_Sicilies|  since 2015.    |Prince_Carlo,_Duke_of_Castro|Prince_Carlo,_Duke_Of_Castro| , Castroist pretender to the  |Two_Sicilies|Two_Sicilies|  since 2008.    |Carlos,_Duke_of_Parma|Carlos,_Duke_Of_Parma| , pretender to Parma since 2010.    |Prince_Sixtus_Henry_of_Bourbon-Parma|Prince_Sixtus_Henry_Of_Bourbon-Parma| ,  |Carlist|Carlism|  pretender to Spain since 1979.    |Prince_Jean,_Duke_of_Vendôme|Prince_Jean,_Duke_Of_Vendôme| ,  |Orléanist|Orléanist|  pretender to France since 2019.    |Prince_Pedro_Carlos_of_Orléans-Braganza|Prince_Pedro_Carlos_Of_Orléans-Braganza| , Petrópolis pretender to Brazil since 2007.    |Prince_Luiz_of_Orléans-Braganza|Prince_Luiz_Of_Orléans-Braganza| , Vassouras pretender to Brazil since 1981.    |Duarte_Pio,_Duke_of_Braganza|Duarte_Pio,_Duke_Of_Braganza| , pretender to Portugal since 1976.          It is estimated that the agnatic descendants of the Capetian dynasty consists of 6,500 people .     The small number of agnatic descendants of the kings of France, compared with a theoretical number, is explained by the frequent marriages between Capetian cousins between the 12th and 20th centuries. Some examples of considerable inbreeding among descendants of the kings of France are:      |Alfonso_XIII_of_Spain|Alfonso_Xiii_Of_Spain| , who, instead of having 1024 ancestors in the 11th generation, only had 111 distinct ancestors;   |Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis_Xiv_Of_France|  is descended 368 times from  |Saint_Louis|Louis_Ix_Of_France|  ; and   The four grandparents of the  |Henri,_Count_of_Paris|Henri,_Count_Of_Paris|  were all of the House of Orleans, all cousins and all grandchildren of  |Louis_Philippe_I|Louis_Philippe_I| .
