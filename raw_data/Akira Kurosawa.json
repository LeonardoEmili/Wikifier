Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.          Shooting of  Sanshiro Sugata  began on location in Yokohama in December 1942.

Kurosawa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor-friendly and less expensive to produce.

Kurosawa agreed, and the Kurosawa Production Company was established in April 1959, with Toho as the majority shareholder.      Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a story that was more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work.  The Bad Sleep Well , based on a script by Kurosawas nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about a young man who is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his fathers death.

A conceited and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as Akahige , played by Mifune.

Red Beard premiered in April 1965, becoming the years highest-grossing Japanese production and the third Kurosawa film to top the prestigious Kinema Jumpo yearly critics poll. It remains one of Kurosawas best-known and most-loved works in his native country. Outside Japan, critics have been much more divided. Most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kurosawas best, while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power, with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artists previous commitment to social and political change.

Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawas costly production methods.      Red Beard also marked the midway point, chronologically, in the artists career. During his previous twenty-nine years in the film industry , he had directed twenty-three films, while during the remaining twenty-eight years, for many and complex reasons, he would complete only seven more. Also, for reasons never adequately explained, Red Beard would be his final film starring Toshiro Mifune. Yu Fujiki, an actor who worked on The Lower Depths, observed, regarding the closeness of the two men on the set, Mr. Kurosawas heart was in Mr. Mifunes body.  Donald Richie has described the rapport between them as a unique symbiosis .

Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.       The first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called  Dora-heita , but when this was deemed too expensive, attention shifted to  Dodesukaden , an adaptation of yet another Shūgorō Yamamoto work, again about the poor and destitute. The film was shot quickly in about nine weeks, with Kurosawa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget. For his first work in color, the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside, with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold, almost surreal palette of primary colors, in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live. It was released in Japan in October 1970, but though a minor critical success, it was greeted with audience indifference. The picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four Knights to dissolve. Initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable, but Dodesukaden has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the directors best work.      Unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems, Kurosawa apparently reached the breaking point: on December 22, 1971, he slit his wrists and throat multiple times. The suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the directors health recovered fairly quickly, with Kurosawa now taking refuge in domestic life, uncertain if he would ever direct another film.

Ran won several awards in Japan, but was not quite as honored there as many of the directors best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been.

For his next movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures  had included brief dream sequences,  Dreams  was to be entirely based upon the directors own dreams. Significantly, for the first time in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone.

He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke the base of his spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film.  His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie  —was never to be fulfilled.     After his accident, Kurosawas health began to deteriorate.

According to Stephen Prince, the latter theme began with Throne of Blood , and recurred in Kurosawa films of the 1980s.

According to such French commentators, Mizoguchi seemed, of the two artists, the more authentically Japanese. But at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between Japanese Mizoguchi and Western Kurosawa by pointing out that Mizo had been at least as much influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kurosawa had ever been, and that this awareness of foreign trends is reflected in his work.      In Japan, there have been critics and other filmmakers who have accused Kurosawas work of elitism, because of his focus on exceptional, heroic individuals and groups of men. In her DVD commentary on Seven Samurai, Joan Mellen maintains that certain shots of the samurai characters Kambei and Kyuzo, which as far as she is concerned reveal Kurosawa privileging these samurai, support the argument voiced by several Japanese critics that Kurosawa was an elitist  ...

Kurosawa defended himself against this charge in his interview with me. I wanted to say that after everything the peasants were the stronger, closely clinging to the earth  ... It was the samurai who were weak because they were being blown by the winds of time.
