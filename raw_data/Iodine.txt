                    Iodine is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  I and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  53. The heaviest of the stable  |halogens|Halogen| , it exists as a lustrous, purple-black non-metallic solid at  |standard_conditions|Standard_Condition|  that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 degrees Celsius, and boils to a violet gas at 184 degrees Celsius. The element was discovered by the French chemist  |Bernard_Courtois|Bernard_Courtois|  in 1811. It was named two years later by  |Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac|Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac|  from this property, after the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  ἰώδης violet-coloured .     Iodine occurs in many oxidation states, including  |iodide|Iodide|  ,  |iodate|Iodate|  , and the various  |periodate|Periodate|  anions. It is the least abundant of the stable halogens, being the sixty-first most abundant element. It is the heaviest essential  |mineral_nutrient|Mineral_Nutrient| . Iodine is essential in the synthesis of  |thyroid_hormones|Thyroid_Hormone| .   |Iodine_deficiency|Iodine_Deficiency|  affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of  |intellectual_disabilities|Intellectual_Disabilities| .     The dominant producers of iodine today are Chile and Japan. Iodine and its  |compounds|Chemical_Compound|  are primarily used in  |nutrition|Nutrition| . Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compound| , it has also found favour as a non-toxic  |radiocontrast|Radiocontrast|  material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine can also be used to treat  |thyroid_cancer|Thyroid_Cancer| . Iodine is also used as a  |catalyst|Catalyst|  in the industrial production of  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid|  and some  |polymers|Polymer| .       In 1811, iodine was discovered by French chemist  |Bernard_Courtois|Bernard_Courtois| ,  In French, seaweed that had been washed onto the shore was called varec , varech , or vareck , whence the English word wrack . Later, varec also referred to the ashes of such seaweed: The ashes were used as a source of iodine and salts of sodium and potassium.  who was born to a manufacturer of  |saltpetre|Potassium_Nitrate|  . At the time of the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , saltpetre was in great demand in France. Saltpetre produced from French  |nitre_beds|Nitrary|  required  |sodium_carbonate|Sodium_Carbonate| , which could be isolated from  |seaweed|Seaweed|  collected on the coasts of  |Normandy|Normandy|  and  |Brittany|Brittany| . To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| . Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 794 Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.      Courtois gave samples to his friends,  |Charles_Bernard_Desormes|Charles_Bernard_Desormes|  and  |Nicolas_Clément|Nicolas_Clément|  , to continue research. He also gave some of the substance to  |chemist|Chemist| |_Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac|Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac|  , and to  |physicist|Physicist| |_André_Marie_Ampère|André_Marie_Ampère|  . On 29 November 1813, Desormes and Clément made Courtois discovery public. They described the substance to a meeting of the Imperial  |Institute_of_France|Institute_Of_France| . Desormes and Clément made their announcement at the Institut impérial de France on 29 November 1813; a summary of their announcement appeared in the Gazette nationale ou Le Moniteur Universel of 2 December 1813. See: F. D. Chattaway  The Chemical News...  , 99 : 193–195. On 6 December, Gay-Lussac announced that the new substance was either an element or a compound of oxygen.    It was Gay-Lussac who suggested the name  iode , from the  |Greek|Ancient_Greek_Language|  word   at the  |Perseus_Digital_Library|Perseus_Digital_Library|   for violet . Ampère had given some of his sample to English chemist  |Humphry_Davy|Humphry_Davy|  , who experimented on the substance and noted its similarity to  |chlorine|Chlorine| .  Davy sent a letter dated 10 December to the  |Royal_Society_of_London|Royal_Society_Of_London|  stating that he had identified a new element.  Arguments erupted between Davy and Gay-Lussac over who identified iodine first, but both scientists acknowledged Courtois as the first to isolate the element.      |Antonio_Grossich|Antonio_Grossich|  , an Istrian-born surgeon, was among the first to use sterilization of the operative field. In 1908, he introduced tincture of iodine as a way for rapid sterilization of the human skin in the surgical field.     In early  |periodic_tables|Periodic_Table| , iodine is often given the symbol J, for Jod, its name in German.           Iodine is the fourth  |halogen|Halogen| , being a member of group 17 in the periodic table, below  |fluorine|Fluorine| ,  |chlorine|Chlorine| , and  |bromine|Bromine| ; it is the heaviest stable member of its group . Iodine has an electron configuration of d 10 5s 2 5p 5 , with the seven electrons in the fifth and outermost shell being its  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron| . Like the other halogens, it is one electron short of a full octet and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell, although in keeping with  |periodic_trends|Periodic_Trend| , it is the weakest oxidising agent among the stable halogens: it has the lowest  |electronegativity|Electronegativity|  among them, just 2.66 on the Pauling scale . Elemental iodine hence forms  |diatomic_molecules|Diatomic_Molecule|  with chemical formula I 2 , where two iodine atoms share a pair of electrons in order to each achieve a stable octet for themselves; at high temperatures, these diatomic molecules reversibly dissociate a pair of iodine atoms. Similarly, the iodide anion, I − , is the strongest reducing agent among the stable halogens, being the most easily oxidised back to diatomic I 2 . Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800–4      The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114  °C and boils at 183  °C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group . Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the  |electron_transition|Atomic_Electron_Transition|  between the  |highest_occupied|Homo_Lumo|  antibonding π g  molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σ u  molecular orbital. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804–9     Elemental iodine is slightly soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450  ml at 20  °C and 1280  ml at 50  °C;  |potassium_iodide|Potassium_Iodide|  may be added to increase solubility via formation of  |triiodide|Triiodide|  ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as  |hexane|Hexane|  and  |carbon_tetrachloride|Carbon_Tetrachloride|  provide a higher solubility.  Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as  |Lewis_bases|Lewis_Base| ; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour.  |Charge_transfer_complex|Charge_Transfer_Complex| es form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in  |alcohols|Alcohol|  and  |amines|Amine| , solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.           The melting and boiling points of iodine are the highest among the halogens, conforming to the increasing trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them that is the most easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest  |van_der_Waals_interactions|Van_Der_Waals_Interaction|  among the halogens. Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the halogens. Because it has the largest  |atomic_radius|Atomic_Radius|  among the halogens, iodine has the lowest first  |ionisation_energy|Ionisation_Energy| , lowest  |electron_affinity|Electron_Affinity| , lowest  |electronegativity|Electronegativity|  and lowest reactivity of the halogens.        The interhalogen bond in diiodine is the weakest of all the halogens. As such, 1% of a sample of gaseous iodine at atmospheric pressure is dissociated into iodine atoms at 575  °C. Temperatures greater than 750  °C are required for fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to dissociate to a similar extent. Most bonds to iodine are weaker than the analogous bonds to the lighter halogens. Gaseous iodine is composed of I 2 molecules with an I–I bond length of 266.6  pm. The I–I bond is one of the longest single bonds known. It is even longer in solid  |orthorhombic|Orthorhombic|  crystalline iodine, which has the same crystal structure as chlorine and bromine.   As such, within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next-nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and  |semiconducting|Semiconductor|  properties. Iodine is a two-dimensional semiconductor with a  |band_gap|Band_Gap|  of 1.3  eV : it is a semiconductor in the plane of its crystalline layers and an insulator in the perpendicular direction.          Of the thirty-seven known  |isotopes_of_iodine|Isotopes_Of_Iodine| , only one occurs in nature, iodine-127. The others are radioactive and have half-lives too short to be  |primordial|Primordial_Nuclide| . As such, iodine is both  |monoisotopic|Monoisotopic_Element|  and  |mononuclidic|Mononuclidic_Element|  and its atomic weight is known to great precision, as it is a constant of nature.     The longest-lived of the radioactive isotopes of iodine is  |iodine_129|Iodine_129| , which has a half-life of 15.7  million  years, decaying via  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  to stable  |xenon|Xenon| -129.  Some iodine-129 was formed along with iodine-127 before the formation of the Solar System, but it has by now completely decayed away, making it an  |extinct_radionuclide|Extinct_Radionuclide|  that is nevertheless still useful in dating the history of the early Solar System or very old groundwaters, due to its mobility in the environment. Its former presence may be determined from an excess of its  |daughter|Decay_Product|  xenon-129.   P. Santschi et al. 129Iodine: A new tracer for surface water/groundwater interaction. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory preprint UCRL-JC-132516. Livermore, USA.      Traces of iodine-129 still exist today, as it is also a  |cosmogenic_nuclide|Cosmogenic_Nuclide| , formed from  |cosmic_ray_spallation|Cosmic_Ray_Spallation|  of atmospheric xenon: these traces make up 10 −14 to 10 −10 of all terrestrial iodine. It also occurs from open-air nuclear testing, and is not hazardous because of its incredibly long half-life, the longest of all fission products. At the peak of thermonuclear testing in the 1960s and 1970s, iodine-129 still made up only about 10 −7 of all terrestrial iodine.    , the  |Scientific_Committee_on_Problems_of_the_Environment|Scientific_Committee_On_Problems_Of_The_Environment|  , 1993. See table 1.9 in Section 1.4.5.2. Excited states of iodine-127 and iodine-129 are often used in  |Mössbauer_spectroscopy|Mössbauer_Spectroscopy| .     The other iodine radioisotopes have much shorter half-lives, no longer than days. Some of them have medical applications involving the  |thyroid_gland|Thyroid_Gland| , where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated.  |Iodine_123|Iodine_123|  has a half-life of thirteen hours and decays by  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  to  |tellurium_123|Tellurium_123| , emitting  |gamma_radiation|Gamma_Radiation| ; it is used in  |nuclear_medicine|Nuclear_Medicine|  imaging, including  |single_photon_emission_computed_tomography|Single_Photon_Emission_Computed_Tomography|  and  |X_ray_computed_tomography|X_Ray_Computed_Tomography|  scans.   |Iodine_125|Iodine_125|  has a half-life of fifty-nine days, decaying by electron capture to  |tellurium_125|Tellurium_125|  and emitting low-energy gamma radiation; the second-longest-lived iodine radioisotope, it has uses in  |biological_assays|Biological_Assay| ,  |nuclear_medicine|Nuclear_Medicine|  imaging and in  |radiation_therapy|Radiation_Therapy|  as  |brachytherapy|Brachytherapy|  to treat a number of conditions, including  |prostate_cancer|Prostate_Cancer| ,  |uveal_melanomas|Uveal_Melanoma| , and  |brain_tumours|Brain_Tumour| . Harper, P.V. ; Siemens, W.D. ; Lathrop, K.A. ; Brizel, H.E. ; Harrison, R.W. Iodine-125. Proc. Japan Conf. Radioisotopes; Vol: 4th Jan 01, 1961 Finally,  |iodine_131|Iodine_131| , with a half-life of eight days, beta decays to an excited state of stable  |xenon_131|Xenon_131|  that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation. It is a common  |fission_product|Fission_Product|  and thus is present in high levels in radioactive  |fallout|Fallout| . It may then be absorbed through contaminated food, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure to high levels of iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of  |radiogenic|Radiogenic| |_thyroid_cancer|Thyroid_Cancer|  in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and  |thyroiditis|Thyroiditis| .      The usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine-131 is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine-127 in the form of  |potassium_iodide|Potassium_Iodide|  tablets, taken daily for optimal prophylaxis.  However, iodine-131 may also be used for medicinal purposes in  |radiation_therapy|Radiation_Therapy|  for this very reason, when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue.  Iodine-131 is also used as a  |radioactive_tracer|Radioactive_Tracer| .                Though it is the least reactive of the halogens, iodine is still one of the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide| ,  |nitric_oxide|Nitric_Oxide| , and  |sulfur_dioxide|Sulfur_Dioxide|  , iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example,  |rhenium|Rhenium|  metal reacts with chlorine to form  |rhenium_hexachloride|Rhenium_Hexachloride| , but with bromine it forms only  |rhenium_pentabromide|Rhenium_Pentabromide|  and iodine can achieve only  |rhenium_tetraiodide|Rhenium_Tetraiodide| . By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in  |iodine_heptafluoride|Iodine_Heptafluoride| .     I 2 dissociates on light, absorbing it at 578  nm wavelength.       The simplest compound of iodine is  |hydrogen_iodide|Hydrogen_Iodide| , HI. It is a colourless gas that reacts with oxygen to give water and iodine. Although it is useful in  |iodination|Iodination|  reactions in the laboratory, it does not have large-scale industrial uses, unlike the other hydrogen halides. Commercially, it is usually made by reacting iodine with  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  or  |hydrazine|Hydrazine|  4 HI + N 2   At room temperature, it is a colourless gas, like all of the hydrogen halides except  |hydrogen_fluoride|Hydrogen_Fluoride| , since hydrogen cannot form strong  |hydrogen_bonds|Hydrogen_Bond|  to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0  °C and boils at −35.1  °C. It is an  |endothermic|Endothermic|  compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a  |catalyst|Catalyst|  is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I  |bond_dissociation_energy|Bond_Dissociation_Energy|  is likewise the smallest of the hydrogen halides, at 295  kJ/mol. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812–9     Aqueous hydrogen iodide is known as  |hydroiodic_acid|Hydroiodic_Acid| , which is a strong acid. Hydrogen iodide is exceptionally soluble in water: one litre of water will dissolve 425 litres of hydrogen iodide, and the saturated solution has only four water molecules per molecule of hydrogen iodide. Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. Inorganic Chemistry Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . Commercial so-called concentrated hydroiodic acid usually contains 48–57% HI by mass; the solution forms an  |azeotrope|Azeotrope|  with boiling point 126.7  °C at 56.7  g HI per 100  g solution. Hence hydroiodic acid cannot be concentrated past this point by evaporation of water.     Unlike  |hydrogen_fluoride|Hydrogen_Fluoride| , anhydrous liquid hydrogen iodide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its  |dielectric_constant|Dielectric_Constant|  is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H 2 I + and  ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the  |bifluoride|Bifluoride|  ions  due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and iodine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as  |Cs_|Caesium|  and   may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen iodide is a poor solvent, able to dissolve only small molecular compounds such as nitrosyl chloride and  |phenol|Phenol| , or salts with very low  |lattice_energies|Lattice_Energy|  such as tetraalkylammonium halides.       Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary iodides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions ; extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation ; and having an electronegativity higher than iodines , so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not iodides but rather oxides, nitrides, or halides of iodine.      Given the large size of the iodide anion and iodines weak oxidising power, high oxidation states are difficult to achieve in binary iodides, the maximum known being in the pentaiodides of  |niobium|Niobium| ,  |tantalum|Tantalum| , and  |protactinium|Protactinium| . Iodides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydroiodic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen iodide gas. These methods work best when the iodide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative iodination of the element with iodine or hydrogen iodide, high-temperature iodination of a metal oxide or other halide by iodine, a volatile metal halide,  |carbon_tetraiodide|Carbon_Tetraiodide| , or an organic iodide. For example,  |molybdenum_oxide|Molybdenum_Oxide|  reacts with  |aluminium_iodide|Aluminium_Iodide|  at 230  °C to give  |molybdenum_iodide|Molybdenum_Iodide| . An example involving halogen exchange is given below, involving the reaction of  |tantalum_chloride|Tantalum_Chloride|  with excess aluminium iodide at 400  °C to give  |tantalum_iodide|Tantalum_Iodide| .
