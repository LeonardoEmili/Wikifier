      John Malcolm Fraser   was an Australian politician who served as the  |22nd|List_Of_Prime_Ministers_Of_Australia_By_Time_In_Office| |Prime_Minister_of_Australia|Prime_Minister_Of_Australia| , in office from 1975 to 1983 as leader of the  |Liberal_Party|Liberal_Party_Of_Australia| .     Fraser was raised on his fathers  |sheep_stations|Sheep_Station| , and after studying at  |Magdalen_College,_Oxford|Magdalen_College,_Oxford| , returned to Australia to take over the family property in the  |Western_District|Western_District|  of  |Victoria|Victoria| . After an initial defeat  |in_1954|1954_Australian_Federal_Election| , he was elected to the  |House_of_Representatives|House_Of_Representatives|  at the  |1955_federal_election|1955_Australian_Federal_Election| , standing in the  |Division_of_Wannon|Division_Of_Wannon| . He was 25 at the time, making him one of the youngest people ever elected to parliament. When  |Harold_Holt|Harold_Holt|  became prime minister in 1966, Fraser was appointed  |Minister_for_the_Army|Minister_For_The_Army| . After Holts  |disappearance|Disappearance_Of_Harold_Holt|  and  |replacement|1968_Liberal_Party_Of_Australia_Leadership_Election|  by  |John_Gorton|John_Gorton| , Fraser became  |Minister_for_Education_and_Science|Minister_For_Education|  and then  |Minister_for_Defence|Minister_For_Defence|  . In 1971, Fraser resigned from cabinet and denounced Gorton as unfit to hold the great office of prime minister ; this precipitated  |the_replacement|1971_Liberal_Party_Of_Australia_Leadership_Election|  of Gorton with  |William_McMahon|William_Mcmahon| . He subsequently returned to his old education and science portfolio.     After the  |Coalition|Coalition|  was defeated at the  |1972_election|1972_Australian_Federal_Election| , Fraser  |unsuccessfully_stood|1972_Liberal_Party_Of_Australia_Leadership_Election|  for the Liberal leadership, losing to  |Billy_Snedden|Billy_Snedden| . When the party lost the  |1974_election|1974_Australian_Federal_Election| , he began to move against Snedden, eventually mounting  |a_successful_challenge|Liberal_Party_Of_Australia_Leadership_Spill,_1975|  in March 1975. As  |Leader_of_the_Opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition| , Fraser used the Coalitions control of the  |Senate|Australian_Senate|  to block  |supply|Supply|  to the  |Whitlam_Government|Whitlam_Government| , precipitating  |a_constitutional_crisis|1975_Australian_Constitutional_Crisis| . This culminated with  |Gough_Whitlam|Gough_Whitlam|  being dismissed as prime minister by Governor-General  |John_Kerr|John_Kerr| , a unique occurrence in Australian history. The correctness of Frasers actions in the crisis and the exact nature of his involvement in Kerrs decision have since been a topic of debate.     After Whitlams dismissal, Fraser was sworn in as prime minister on an initial  |caretaker|Caretaker_Government|  basis. The Coalition won a landslide victory at the  |1975_election|1975_Australian_Federal_Election| , and was re-elected  |in_1977|1977_Australian_Federal_Election|  and  |1980|1980_Australian_Federal_Election| . Fraser took a keen interest in foreign affairs as prime minister, and was more active in the international sphere than many of his predecessors. He was a strong supporter of  |multiculturalism|Multiculturalism_In_Australia| , and during his term in office Australia admitted significant numbers of non-white immigrants   |for_the_first_time|White_Australia_Policy| . His government also established the  |Special_Broadcasting_Service|Special_Broadcasting_Service|  . Particularly in his final years in office, Fraser came into conflict with the  |economic_rationalist|Economic_Rationalism|  faction of his party. His government made few major changes to economic policy.     Fraser and the Coalition lost power at the  |1983_election|1983_Australian_Federal_Election| , and he left politics a short time later. To date, he is the last Prime Minister from a country seat. In retirement, he held advisory positions with the UN and Commonwealth of Nations, and was president of the aid agency  |CARE|Care|  from 1990 to 1995. He resigned his membership of the Liberal Party in 2009, having been a critic of its policy direction for a number of years. Evaluations of Frasers prime ministership have been mixed. He is generally credited with restoring stability to the country after a series of short-term leaders, but some have seen his government as a lost opportunity for economic reform. Only three Australian prime ministers have served longer terms in office –  |Robert_Menzies|Robert_Menzies| ,  |John_Howard|John_Howard|  and  |Bob_Hawke|Bob_Hawke| .         John Malcolm Fraser was born in  |Toorak,_Melbourne,_Victoria|Toorak,_Victoria| , on 21 May 1930. He was the second of two children born to Una Arnold and John Neville Fraser; his older sister Lorraine had been born in 1928. Both he and his father were known exclusively by their middle names. His paternal grandfather,  |Sir_Simon_Fraser|Simon_Fraser| , was born in  |Nova_Scotia|Nova_Scotia| , Canada, and arrived in Australia in 1853. He made his fortune as a railway contractor, and later acquired significant  |pastoral|Pastoral_Farming|  holdings, becoming a member of the  |squattocracy|Squattocracy|  . Frasers maternal grandfather, Louis Woolf, was born in  |Dunedin|Dunedin| , New Zealand, and arrived in Australia as a child. He was of Jewish origin, a fact which his grandson did not learn until he was an adult. A chartered accountant by trade, he married Amy Booth, who was related to the wealthy  |Hordern_family|Hordern_Family|  of Sydney and was a first cousin of  |Sir_Samuel_Hordern|Samuel_Hordern| .      Fraser had a political background on both sides of his family. His father served on the  |Wakool_Shire_Council|Wakool_Shire| , including as president for two years, and was an admirer of  |Billy_Hughes|Billy_Hughes|  and a friend of  |Richard_Casey|Richard_Casey,_Baron_Casey| . Simon Fraser served in both houses of the colonial  |Parliament_of_Victoria|Parliament_Of_Victoria| , and represented Victoria at several of the  |constitutional_conventions|Constitutional_Convention|  of the 1890s. He eventually become one of the inaugural members of the new  |federal_Senate|Australian_Senate| , serving from 1901 to 1913 as a member of the early conservative parties. Louis Woolf also ran for the Senate in 1901, standing as a  |Free_Trader|Free_Trade_Party|  in  |Western_Australia|Western_Australia| . He polled only 400 votes across the whole state, and was never again a candidate for public office.       Fraser spent most of his early life at Balpool-Nyang, a  |sheep_station|Sheep_Station|  of  on the  |Edward_River|Edward_River|  near  |Moulamein,_New_South_Wales|Moulamein,_New_South_Wales| . His father had a law degree from  |Magdalen_College,_Oxford|Magdalen_College,_Oxford| , but never practised law and preferred the life of a grazier. Fraser contracted a severe case of pneumonia when he was eight years old, which nearly proved fatal. He was home-schooled until the age of ten, when he was sent to board at  |Tudor_House_School|Tudor_House_School|  in the  |Southern_Highlands|Southern_Highlands| . He attended Tudor House from 1940 to 1943, and then completed his secondary education at  |Melbourne_Grammar_School|Melbourne_Grammar_School|  from 1944 to 1948 where he was a member of Rusden House. While at Melbourne Grammar, he lived in a flat that his parents owned on  |Collins_Street|Collins_Street,_Melbourne| . In 1943, Frasers father sold Balpool-Nyang – which had been prone to drought – and bought Nareen, in the  |Western_District|Western_District|  of Victoria. He was devastated by the sale of his childhood home, and regarded the day he found out about it as the worst of his life.       In 1949, Fraser moved to England to study at  |Magdalen_College,_Oxford|Magdalen_College,_Oxford| , which his father had also attended. He read  |Philosophy,_Politics_and_Economics|Philosophy,_Politics_And_Economics|  , graduating in 1952 with  |third-class_honours|Third-Class_Honours| . Although Fraser did not excel academically, he regarded his time at Oxford as his intellectual awakening, where he learned how to think . His college  |tutor|Tutor|  was  |Harry_Weldon|Thomas_Dewar_Weldon| , who was a strong influence. His circle of friends at Oxford included  |Raymond_Bonham_Carter|Raymond_Bonham_Carter| ,  |Nicolas_Browne-Wilkinson|Nicolas_Browne-Wilkinson,_Baron_Browne-Wilkinson| , and  |John_Turner|John_Turner| . In his second year, he had a relationship with Anne Reid, who as  |Anne_Fairbairn|Anne_Fairbairn|  later became a prominent poet. After graduating, Fraser considered taking a law degree or joining the  |British_Army|British_Army| , but eventually decided to return to Australia and take over the running of the family property.       Fraser returned to Australia in mid-1952. He began attending meetings of the  |Young_Liberals|Young_Liberals|  in  |Hamilton|Hamilton,_Victoria| , and became acquainted with many of the local party officials. In November 1953, aged 23, Fraser unexpectedly won Liberal  |preselection|Preselection|  for the  |Division_of_Wannon|Division_Of_Wannon| , which covered most of Victorias Western District. The previous Liberal member,  |Dan_Mackinnon|Dan_Mackinnon| , had been defeated in 1951 and moved to a different electorate. He was expected to be succeeded by  |Magnus_Cormack|Magnus_Cormack| , who had recently lost his place in the Senate. Fraser had put his name forward as a way of building a profile for future candidacies, but mounted a strong campaign and in the end won a narrow victory. Ayres , pp. 51–56. In January 1954, he made the first of a series of weekly radio broadcasts on  |3HA_Hamilton|3Ha|  and  |3YB_Warrnambool|3Yb| , titled One Australia. His program – consisting of a pre-recorded 15-minute monologue – covered a wide range of topics, and was often reprinted in newspapers. It continued more or less uninterrupted until his retirement from politics in 1983, and helped him build a substantial personal following in his electorate. Fraser & Simons , pp. 76.     At the  |1954_election|1954_Australian_Federal_Election| , Fraser lost to the sitting  |Labor|Australian_Labor_Party|  member  |Don_McLeod|Don_Mcleod|  by just 17 votes . Ayres , p. 61. However, he reprised his candidacy at the early  |1955_election|1955_Australian_Federal_Election|  after a  |redistribution|Electoral_Redistribution|  made Wannon notionally Liberal. McLeod concluded the reconfigured Wannon was unwinnable and retired. These factors, combined with the  |1955_Labor_Party_split|Australian_Labor_Party_Split_Of_1955| , allowed Fraser to win a landslide victory. Ayres , p. 62.          Fraser took his seat in parliament at the age of 25 – the youngest sitting MP by four years, and the first who had been too young to serve in World War II. Ayres , p. 64. He was re-elected at the  |1958_election|1958_Australian_Federal_Election|  despite being restricted in his campaigning by a bout of hepatitis. Ayres , pp. 80–81. Fraser was soon being touted as a future member of cabinet, but despite good relations with  |Robert_Menzies|Robert_Menzies|  never served in any of his ministries. This was probably due to a combination of his youth and the fact that the ministry already contained a disproportionately high number of Victorians. Ayres , pp. 90–91.      Fraser spoke on a wide range of topics during his early years in parliament, but took a particular interest in foreign affairs. In 1964, he and Gough Whitlam were both awarded Leader Grants by the  |United_States_Department_of_State|United_States_Department_Of_State| , allowing them to spend two months in Washington, D.C., getting to know American political and military leaders. The Vietnam War was the main topic of conversation, and on his return trip to Australia he spent two days in  |Saigon|Saigon| . Ayres , pp. 96–99. Early in 1965, he also made a private seven-day visit to  |Jakarta|Jakarta| , and with assistance from Ambassador  |Mick_Shann|Mick_Shann|  secured meetings with various high-ranking officials. Ayres , pp. 100–102.          After more than a decade on the backbench, Fraser was appointed to the  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_Australia|  by the prime minister,  |Harold_Holt|Harold_Holt| , in 1966. As  |Minister_for_the_Army|Minister_For_Defence|  he presided over the controversial  |Vietnam_War_conscription_program|Conscription_In_Australiavietnam_War| .     Under the new prime minister,  |John_Gorton|John_Gorton| , he became  |Minister_for_Education_and_Science|Minister_For_Education|  and in 1969 was promoted to  |Minister_for_Defence|Minister_For_Defence| , a particularly challenging post at the time, given the height of Australias involvement in the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  and the protests against it.      In March 1971 Fraser abruptly resigned from the Cabinet in protest at what he called Gortons interference in ministerial responsibilities .      This precipitated a series of events which eventually led to the downfall of Gorton and his replacement as prime minister by  |William_McMahon|William_Mcmahon| . Gorton never forgave Fraser for the role he played in his downfall; to the day Gorton died in 2002, he could not bear to be in the same room with Fraser.      McMahon immediately reappointed Fraser to the Cabinet, returning him to his old position of Minister for Education and Science. When the Liberals were defeated at the  |1972_election|1972_Australian_Federal_Election|  by the  |Labor_Party|Australian_Labor_Party|  under  |Gough_Whitlam|Gough_Whitlam| , McMahon resigned and Fraser became  |Shadow_Minister_for_Labour|Minister_For_Employment_And_Workplace_Relations|  under  |Billy_Snedden|Billy_Snedden| .       After the Coalition lost the  |1972_election|1972_Australian_Federal_Election| , Fraser was  |one_of_five_candidates|1972_Liberal_Party_Of_Australia_Leadership_Election|  for the Liberal leadership that had been vacated by McMahon. He outpolled John Gorton and  |James_Killen|James_Killen| , but was eliminated on the third ballot.  |Billy_Snedden|Billy_Snedden|  eventually defeated  |Nigel_Bowen|Nigel_Bowen|  by a single vote on the fifth ballot. In the new  |shadow_cabinet|Shadow_Cabinet_Of_Australia|  – which featured only Liberals – Fraser was given responsibility for primary industry. This was widely seen as a snub, as the new portfolio kept him mostly out of the public eye and was likely to be given to a member of the Country Party when the Coalition returned to government. Ayres , p. 203. In an August 1973 reshuffle, Snedden instead made him the Liberals spokesman for industrial relations. He had hoped to be given responsibility for foreign affairs , but that role was given to  |Andrew_Peacock|Andrew_Peacock| . Ayres , p. 213. Fraser oversaw the development of the partys new industrial relations policy, which was released in April 1974. It was seen as more flexible and even-handed than the policy that the Coalition had pursued in government, and was received well by the media. Ayres , pp. 214–220. According to Frasers biographer  |Philip_Ayres|Philip_James_Ayres| , by putting a new policy in place, he managed to modify his public image and emerge as an excellent communicator across a traditionally hostile divide .       After the Liberals lost the  |1974_election|1974_Australian_Federal_Election| , Fraser unsuccessfully challenged Snedden for the leadership in November. Despite surviving the challenge, Sneddens position in opinion polls continued to decline and he was unable to get the better of Whitlam in the Parliament. Fraser again challenged Snedden on 21 March 1975, this time succeeding and becoming Leader of the Liberal Party and  |Leader_of_the_Opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition| .          Following a series of ministerial scandals engulfing the  |Whitlam_Government|Gough_Whitlam|  later that year, Fraser began to instruct Coalition senators to delay the governments budget bills, with the objective of forcing an early election that he believed he would win. After several months of political deadlock, during which time the government secretly explored methods of obtaining supply funding outside the Parliament, the  |Governor-General|Governor-General_Of_Australia| ,  |Sir_John_Kerr|John_Kerr| , controversially dismissed Whitlam as prime minister on 11 November 1975. In Matters for Judgment, Sir John Kerr recounted having to reject government advice to that end proffered by the attorney-general,  |Kep_Enderby|Kep_Enderby| .     Fraser was immediately sworn in as  |caretaker|Caretaker_Government|  prime minister on the condition that he end the political deadlock and call an immediate  |double_dissolution|Double_Dissolution|  election.     On 19 November 1975, shortly after the election had been called, a letter bomb was sent to Fraser, but it was intercepted and defused before it reached him. Similar devices were sent to the governor-general and the  |Premier_of_Queensland|Premier_Of_Queensland| ,  |Joh_Bjelke-Petersen|Joh_Bjelke-Petersen| .                 At the  |1975_election|1975_Australian_Federal_Election| , Fraser led the  |Liberal-Country_Party_Coalition|Coalition|  to a landslide victory. The Coalition won 91 seats of a possible 127 in the election to gain a 55-seat majority,  which remains to date the largest in Australian history. Fraser subsequently led the Coalition to a second victory in  |1977|1977_Australian_Federal_Election| , with only a very small decrease in their vote. The Liberals actually won a majority in their own right in both of these elections, something that Menzies and Holt had never achieved. Although Fraser thus had no need for the support of the Country Party to govern, he retained the formal Coalition between the two parties.     Fraser quickly dismantled some of the programs of the Whitlam Government, such as the Ministry of the Media, and made major changes to the universal health insurance system  |Medibank|Medibank| . He initially maintained Whitlams levels of tax and spending, but real per-person tax and spending soon began to increase. He did manage to rein in inflation, which had soared under Whitlam. His so-called Razor Gang implemented stringent budget cuts across many areas of the Commonwealth Public Sector, including the  |Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation|Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation|  .      Fraser practised  |Keynesian|Keynesian|  economics during his time as Prime Minister,  in part demonstrated by running budget deficits throughout his term as Prime Minister.  He was the Liberal Partys last Keynesian Prime Minister. Though he had long been identified with the Liberal Partys right wing, he did not carry out the radically conservative program that his political enemies had predicted, and that some of his followers wanted. Frasers relatively moderate policies particularly disappointed the  |Treasurer|Treasurer_Of_Australia| ,  |John_Howard|John_Howard| , as well as other ministers who were strong adherents of  |economic_liberalism|Economic_Liberalism| , and therefore detractors of Keynesian economics. The governments economic record was marred by rising double-digit unemployment and double-digit inflation, creating  |stagflation|Stagflation|  , caused in part by the ongoing effects of the  |1973_oil_crisis|1973_Oil_Crisis| .      Fraser was particularly active in foreign policy as prime minister. He supported the  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  in campaigning to abolish  |apartheid|South_Africa_Under_Apartheid|  in South Africa and refused permission for the aircraft carrying the  |Springbok|South_Africa_National_Rugby_Union_Team|  rugby team to refuel on Australian territory en route to their controversial  |1981_tour_of_New_Zealand|1981_South_Africa_Rugby_Union_Tour_Of_New_Zealand| .  However, an earlier tour by the South African ski boat angling team was allowed to pass through Australia on the way to New Zealand in 1977 and the transit records were suppressed by Cabinet order.      Fraser also strongly opposed white minority rule in  |Rhodesia|Rhodesia| . During the 1979 Commonwealth Conference, Fraser, together with his Nigerian counterpart, convinced the newly elected British prime minister,  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher| , to withhold recognition of the internal settlement  |Zimbabwe_Rhodesia|Zimbabwe_Rhodesia|  government; Thatcher had earlier promised to recognise it. Subsequently, the  |Lancaster_House_Agreement|Lancaster_House_Agreement|  was signed and  |Robert_Mugabe|Robert_Mugabe|  was elected leader of an independent  |Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe|  at the inaugural  |1980_election|1980_Zimbabwean_Parliamentary_Election| . Duncan Campbell, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated that Fraser was the principal architect in the ending of white minority rule.  The  |President_of_Tanzania|President_Of_Tanzania| ,  |Julius_Nyerere|Julius_Nyerere| , said that he considered Frasers role crucial in many parts and the  |President_of_Zambia|President_Of_Zambia| ,  |Kenneth_Kaunda|Kenneth_Kaunda| , called his contribution vital .       Under Fraser, Australia recognised  |Indonesias|Indonesia| |annexation|Indonesian_Occupation_Of_East_Timor|  of  |East_Timor|East_Timor| , although many East Timorese refugees were granted  |asylum_in_Australia|Asylum_In_Australia| . Fraser was also a strong supporter of the United States and supported the boycott of the  |1980_Summer_Olympics|1980_Summer_Olympics|  in Moscow. However, although he persuaded some sporting bodies not to compete, Fraser did not try to prevent the  |Australian_Olympic_Committee|Australian_Olympic_Committee|  sending a team to the Moscow Games.     Fraser also surprised his critics over immigration policy; according to 1977 Cabinet documents, the Fraser Government adopted a formal policy for a humanitarian commitment to admit refugees for resettlement .  Frasers aim was to expand immigration from Asian countries and allow more refugees to enter Australia. He was a firm supporter of  |multiculturalism|Multiculturalism|  and established a government-funded multilingual radio and television network, the  |Special_Broadcasting_Service|Special_Broadcasting_Service|  , building on their first radio stations which had been established under the Whitlam Government. , SBS web site      Despite Frasers support for SBS, his government imposed stringent budget cuts on the national broadcaster, the  |ABC|Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation| , which came under repeated attack from the Coalition for alleged left-wing bias and unfair coverage on their TV programs, including  This Day Tonight  and  Four Corners , and on the ABCs new youth-oriented radio station  |Double_Jay|Triple_J| . One result of the cuts was a plan to establish a national youth radio network, of which Double Jay was the first station. The network was delayed for many years and did not come to fruition until the 1990s. Fraser also legislated to give  |Indigenous_Australians|Indigenous_Australians|  control of their traditional lands in the  |Northern_Territory|Northern_Territory| , but resisted imposing land rights laws on conservative state governments.        At the  |1980_election|1980_Australian_Federal_Election| , Fraser saw his majority more than halved, from 48 seats to 21. The Coalition also lost control of the Senate. Despite this, Fraser remained ahead of Labor leader  |Bill_Hayden|Bill_Hayden|  in opinion polls. However, the economy was hit by the  |early_1980s_recession|Early_1980S_Recession| , and a protracted scandal over tax-avoidance schemes run by some high-profile Liberals also began to hurt the Government.     In April 1981, the  |Minister_for_Industrial_Relations|Minister_For_Employment_And_Workplace_Relations| ,  |Andrew_Peacock|Andrew_Peacock| , resigned from the Cabinet, accusing Fraser of constant interference in his portfolio . Fraser, however, had accused former prime minister  |John_Gorton|John_Gorton|  of the same thing a decade earlier. Peacock subsequently challenged Fraser for the leadership; although Fraser defeated Peacock, these events left him politically weakened.     By early 1982, the popular former  |ACTU_President|Australian_Council_Of_Trade_Unions| ,  |Bob_Hawke|Bob_Hawke| , who had entered Parliament in 1980, was polling well ahead of both Fraser and the Labor Leader,  |Bill_Hayden|Bill_Hayden| , on the question of who voters would rather see as prime minister. Fraser was well aware of the infighting this caused between Hayden and Hawke and had planned to call a snap election in autumn 1982, preventing the Labor Party changing leaders. These plans were derailed when Fraser suffered a severe back injury. Shortly after recovering from his injury, the Liberal Party narrowly won a  |by-election|1982_Flinders_By-Election|  in the marginal seat of  |Flinders|Division_Of_Flinders|  in December 1982. The failure of the Labor Party to win the seat convinced Fraser that he would be able to win an election against Hayden.     As leadership tensions began to grow in the Labor Party throughout January, Fraser subsequently resolved to call a  |double_dissolution|Double_Dissolution| |election|1983_Australian_Federal_Election|  at the earliest opportunity, hoping to capitalise on Labors disunity. He knew that if the writs were issued soon enough, Labor would essentially be frozen into going into the subsequent election with Hayden as leader.     On 3 February 1983, Fraser arranged to visit the  |Governor-General_of_Australia|Governor-General_Of_Australia| ,  |Ninian_Stephen|Ninian_Stephen| , intending to ask for a surprise election. However, Fraser made his run too late. Without any knowledge of Frasers plans, Hayden resigned as Labor leader just two hours before Fraser travelled to  |Government_House|Government_House,_Canberra| . This meant that the considerably more popular Hawke was able to replace him at almost exactly the same time that the writs were issued for the election. Although Fraser reacted to the move by saying he looked forward to knock two Labor Leaders off in one go at the forthcoming election, Labor immediately surged in the opinion polls.      At the election on 5 March the Coalition was heavily defeated, suffering a 24-seat swing, the worst defeat of a non-Labor government since Federation. Fraser immediately announced his resignation as Liberal leader and formally resigned as prime minister on 11 March 1983; he retired from Parliament two months later. To date, he is the last non-interim prime minister from a rural seat.       In retirement Fraser served as Chairman of the UN Panel of Eminent Persons on the Role of Transnational Corporations in South Africa 1985, as Co-Chairman of the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons on South Africa in 1985–86 , and as Chairman of the UN Secretary-Generals Expert Group on African Commodity Issues in 1989–90. He was a distinguished international fellow at the  |American_Enterprise_Institute|American_Enterprise_Institute|  from 1984 to 1986. Fraser helped to establish the foreign aid group  |CARE|Care|  organisation in Australia and became the agencys international president in 1991, and worked with a number of other charitable organisations. In 2006, he was appointed Professorial Fellow at the Asia Pacific Centre for Military Law, and in October 2007 he presented his inaugural professorial lecture, Finding Security in Terrorisms Shadow: The importance of the rule of law .        On 14 October 1986, Fraser, then the Chairman of the  |Commonwealth_Eminent_Persons_Group|Commonwealth_Eminent_Persons_Group| , was found in the foyer of the Admiral Benbow Inn, a seedy  |Memphis|Memphis,_Tennessee|  hotel, wearing only a pair of underpants and confused as to where his trousers were. The hotel was an establishment popular with prostitutes and drug dealers. Though it was rumoured at the time that the former Prime Minister had been with a prostitute, his wife stated that Fraser had no recollection of the events and that she believes it more likely that he was the victim of a practical joke by his fellow delegates.           In 1993, Fraser made a bid for the Liberal Party presidency but withdrew at the last minute following opposition to his bid, which was raised due to him having been critical of then Liberal leader  |John_Hewson|John_Hewson|  for losing the election earlier that year.     After 1996, Fraser was critical of the  |Howard_Coalition_government|Howard_Government|  over foreign policy issues, particularly  |John_Howards|John_Howard|  alignment with the foreign policy of the  |Bush|George_W._Bush|  administration, which Fraser saw as damaging Australian relationships in Asia. He opposed Howards policy on  |asylum-seekers|Asylum-Seekers| , campaigned in support of an  |Australian_Republic|Republicanism_In_Australia|  and attacked what he perceived as a lack of integrity in Australian politics, together with former Labor prime minister  |Gough_Whitlam|Gough_Whitlam| , finding much common ground with his predecessor and his successor  |Bob_Hawke|Bob_Hawke| , another republican.       The  |2001_election|2001_Australian_Federal_Election|  continued his estrangement from the Liberal Party. Many Liberals criticised the Fraser years as a decade of lost opportunity on deregulation of the Australian economy and other issues. In early 2004, a  |Young_Liberal|Young_Liberals|  convention in Hobart called for Frasers life membership of the Liberal Party to be ended.      In 2006, Fraser criticised Howard Liberal government policies on areas such as refugees, terrorism and civil liberties, and that if Australia continues to follow United States policies, it runs the risk of being embroiled in the  |conflict_in_Iraq|Conflict_In_Iraq|  for decades, and a fear of  |Islam|Islam|  in the Australian community will take years to eradicate .
