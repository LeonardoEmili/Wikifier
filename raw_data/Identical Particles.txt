     Identical particles, also called indistinguishable or indiscernible particles, are  |particles|Particle|  that cannot be distinguished from one another, even in principle. Species of identical particles include, but are not limited to  |elementary_particles|Elementary_Particle|  such as  |electrons|Electron| , composite  |subatomic_particles|Subatomic_Particle|  such as  |atomic_nuclei|Atomic_Nuclei| , as well as  |atoms|Atom|  and  |molecules|Molecule| .  |Quasiparticles|Quasiparticle|  also behave in this way. Although all known indistinguishable particles are  |tiny|Quantum_Realm| , there is no exhaustive list of all possible sorts of particles nor a clear-cut limit of applicability, as explored in  |quantum_statistics|Particle_Statistics_Quantum_Statistics| .     There are two main categories of identical particles:  |bosons|Boson| , which can share  |quantum_states|Quantum_State| , and  |fermions|Fermion| , which do not share quantum states as described by the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| . Examples of bosons are  |photons|Photon| ,  |gluons|Gluon| ,  |phonons|Phonon| ,  |helium-4|Helium-4|  nuclei and all  |mesons|Meson| . Examples of fermions are  |electrons|Electron| ,  |neutrinos|Neutrino| ,  |quarks|Quark| ,  |protons|Proton| ,  |neutrons|Neutron| , and  |helium-3|Helium-3|  nuclei.     The fact that particles can be identical has important consequences in  |statistical_mechanics|Statistical_Mechanics| . Calculations in statistical mechanics rely on  |probabilistic|Probability_Theory|  arguments, which are sensitive to whether or not the objects being studied are identical. As a result, identical particles exhibit markedly different statistical behaviour from distinguishable particles. For example, the indistinguishability of particles has been proposed as a solution to Gibbs  |mixing_paradox|Gibbs_Paradox| .         There are two methods for distinguishing between particles. The first method relies on differences in the intrinsic physical properties of the particles, such as  |mass|Mass| ,  |electric_charge|Electric_Charge| , and  |spin|Spin| . If differences exist, it is possible to distinguish between the particles by measuring the relevant properties. However, it is an empirical fact that microscopic particles of the same species have completely equivalent physical properties. For instance, every electron in the universe has exactly the same electric charge; this is why it is possible to speak of such a thing as  |the_charge_of_the_electron|Elementary_Charge|  .     Even if the particles have equivalent physical properties, there remains a second method for distinguishing between particles, which is to track the trajectory of each particle. As long as the position of each particle can be measured with infinite precision , then there would be no ambiguity about which particle is which.     The problem with the second approach is that it contradicts the principles of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| . According to quantum theory, the particles do not possess definite positions during the periods between measurements. Instead, they are governed by  |wavefunctions|Wavefunction|  that give the probability of finding a particle at each position. As time passes, the wavefunctions tend to spread out and overlap. Once this happens, it becomes impossible to determine, in a subsequent measurement, which of the particle positions correspond to those measured earlier. The particles are then said to be indistinguishable.                   What follows is an example to make the above discussion concrete, using the formalism developed in the article on the  |mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics|Mathematical_Formulation_Of_Quantum_Mechanics| .     Let n denote a complete set of quantum numbers for specifying single-particle states  For simplicity, consider a system composed of two particles that are not interacting with each other. Suppose that one particle is in the state n 1 , and the other is in the state n 2 . Intuitively, the quantum state of the system is written as     :   n1     n2       where the state writing order matters such as the firstly written state is for the particle 1 and the secondly written state is for the particle 2 . This is simply the canonical way of constructing a basis for a  |tensor_product|Tensor_Product|  space H   H of the combined system from the individual spaces. This expression is valid for distinguishable particles, however, it is not appropriate for indistinguishable particles since  n1   n2  and  n2   n1  as a result of exchanging the particles are generally different states.     the particle 1 occupies the n 1 state and the particle 2 occupies the n 2 state ≠ the particle 1 occupies the n 2 state and the particle 2 occupies the n 1 state .     Two states are physically equivalent only if they differ by a complex phase factor. For two indistinguishable particles, a state before the particle exchange must be physically equivalent to the state after the exchange, so these two state differ only by a complex phase factor. This fact suggests that a state for two indistinguishable particles is given by following two possibilities:        :  n1   n2     n2   n1      States where it is a sum are known as symmetric, while states involving the difference are called antisymmetric. More completely, symmetric states have the form     :  n1, n2; S              while antisymmetric states have the form     :  n1, n2; A              Note that if n 1 and n 2 are the same, the antisymmetric expression gives zero, which cannot be a state vector since it cannot be normalized. In other words, more than one identical particle cannot occupy an antisymmetric state . This is known as the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| , and it is the fundamental reason behind the  |chemical|Chemistry|  properties of atoms and the stability of  |matter|Matter| .         The importance of symmetric and antisymmetric states is ultimately based on empirical evidence. It appears to be a fact of nature that identical particles do not occupy states of a mixed symmetry, such as     :  n1, n2; ?            There is actually an exception to this rule, which will be discussed later. On the other hand, it can be shown that the symmetric and antisymmetric states are in a sense special, by examining a particular symmetry of the multiple-particle states known as exchange symmetry.     Define a linear operator P, called the exchange operator. When it acts on a tensor product of two state vectors, it exchanges the values of the state vectors:     : P               P is both  |Hermitian|Hermitian_Operator|  and  |unitary|Unitary_Operator| . Because it is unitary, it can be regarded as a  |symmetry_operator|Symmetry| . This symmetry may be described as the symmetry under the exchange of labels attached to the particles .     Clearly, P2 1 , so the  |eigenvalues|Eigenvalue|  of P are +1 and & minus;1. The corresponding  |eigenvectors|Eigenvector|  are the symmetric and antisymmetric states:     : P n1, n2; S  +  n1, n2; S    : P n1, n2; A  -  n1, n2; A      In other words, symmetric and antisymmetric states are essentially unchanged under the exchange of particle labels: they are only multiplied by a factor of +1 or & minus;1, rather than being rotated somewhere else in the Hilbert space. This indicates that the particle labels have no physical meaning, in agreement with the earlier discussion on indistinguishability.     It will be recalled that P is Hermitian. As a result, it can be regarded as an observable of the system, which means that, in principle, a measurement can be performed to find out if a state is symmetric or antisymmetric. Furthermore, the equivalence of the particles indicates that the  |Hamiltonian|Hamiltonian|  can be written in a symmetrical form, such as     : H   +   + U + V + V     It is possible to show that such Hamiltonians satisfy the  |commutation_relation|Commutator|      :   0     According to the  |Heisenberg_equation|Heisenberg_Picture| , this means that the value of P is a constant of motion. If the quantum state is initially symmetric , it will remain symmetric as the system evolves. Mathematically, this says that the state vector is confined to one of the two eigenspaces of P, and is not allowed to range over the entire Hilbert space. Thus, that eigenspace might as well be treated as the actual Hilbert space of the system. This is the idea behind the definition of  |Fock_space|Fock_Space| .         The choice of symmetry or antisymmetry is determined by the species of particle. For example, symmetric states must always be used when describing  |photons|Photon|  or  |helium-4|Helium-4|  atoms, and antisymmetric states when describing  |electrons|Electron|  or  |protons|Proton| .     Particles which exhibit symmetric states are called  |bosons|Boson| . The nature of symmetric states has important consequences for the statistical properties of systems composed of many identical bosons. These statistical properties are described as  |Bose–Einstein_statistics|Bose–Einstein_Statistics| .     Particles which exhibit antisymmetric states are called  |fermions|Fermion| . Antisymmetry gives rise to the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| , which forbids identical fermions from sharing the same quantum state. Systems of many identical fermions are described by  |Fermi–Dirac_statistics|Fermi–Dirac_Statistics| .      |Parastatistics|Parastatistics|  are also possible.     In certain two-dimensional systems, mixed symmetry can occur. These exotic particles are known as  |anyons|Anyon| , and they obey  |fractional_statistics|Fractional_Statistics| . Experimental evidence for the existence of anyons exists in the  |fractional_quantum_Hall_effect|Quantum_Hall_Effect| , a phenomenon observed in the two-dimensional electron gases that form the inversion layer of  |MOSFETs|Mosfet| . There is another type of statistic, known as  |braid_statistics|Braid_Statistics| , which are associated with particles known as  |plektons|Plekton| .     The  |spin-statistics_theorem|Spin-Statistics_Theorem|  relates the exchange symmetry of identical particles to their  |spin|Spin| . It states that bosons have integer spin, and fermions have half-integer spin. Anyons possess fractional spin.     N particles N particles. Suppose there are N particles with quantum numbers n 1 , n 2 , ..., n N . If the particles are bosons, they occupy a totally symmetric state, which is symmetric under the exchange of any two particle labels:     :  n1 n2   nN; S       n   n     n      Here, the sum is taken over all different states under  |permutations|Permutation|  p acting on N elements. The square root left to the sum is a  |normalizing_constant|Normalizing_Constant| . The quantity m n  stands for the number of times each of the single-particle states n appears in the N-particle state. Note that ∑ n m n N.     In the same vein, fermions occupy totally antisymmetric states is the  |sign|Parity_Of_A_Permutation|  of each permutation . Note that there is no   mn term, because each single-particle state can appear only once in a fermionic state. Otherwise the sum would again be zero due to the antisymmetry, thus representing a physically impossible state. This is the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle|  for many particles.     These states have been normalized so that     :   n1 n2   nN; S   n1 n2   nN; S  1,     n1 n2   nN; A   n1 n2   nN; A  1.         Suppose there is a system of N bosons in the symmetric state     :  n1 n2   nN; S/A       and a measurement is performed on some other set of discrete observables, m. In general, this yields some result m 1  for one particle, m 2  for another particle, and so forth. If the particles are bosons , the state after the measurement must remain symmetric , i.e.     :  m1 m2   mN; S/A       The probability of obtaining a particular result for the m measurement is     : P     m1   mN; S/A   n1   nN; S/A         It can be shown that     :   P 1     which verifies that the total probability is 1. The sum has to be restricted to ordered values of m 1 , ..., m N  to ensure that each multi-particle state is not counted more than once.         So far, the discussion has included only discrete observables. It can be extended to continuous observables, such as the  |position|Position|   x.     Recall that an eigenstate of a continuous observable represents an infinitesimal range of values of the observable, not a single value as with discrete observables. For instance, if a particle is in a state  ψ⟩, the probability of finding it in a region of volume d 3 x surrounding some position x is     :    x         d3 x     As a result, the continuous eigenstates  x⟩ are normalized to the  |delta_function|Dirac_Delta_Function|  instead of unity:     :   x   x         Symmetric and antisymmetric multi-particle states can be constructed from continuous eigenstates in the same way as before. However, it is customary to use a different normalizing constant:     :  x1 x2   xN; S       x   x     x    :  x1 x2   xN; A         x   x     x      A many-body  |wavefunction|Wavefunction|  can be written,     :         &     x1 x2   xN; S   n1 n2   nN; S       &                       :         &     x1 x2   xN; A   n1 n2   nN; A       &                         where the single-particle wavefunctions are defined, as usual, by     :       x   n       The most important property of these wavefunctions is that exchanging any two of the coordinate variables changes the wavefunction by only a plus or minus sign. This is the manifestation of symmetry and antisymmetry in the wavefunction representation:     :             :     -           The many-body wavefunction has the following significance: if the system is initially in a state with quantum numbers n 1 , ..., n N , and a position measurement is performed, the probability of finding particles in infinitesimal volumes near x 1 , x 2 , ..., x N is     : N!         d      The factor of N! comes from our normalizing constant, which has been chosen so that, by analogy with single-particle wavefunctions,     :       d3  d3    d3  1     Because each integral runs over all possible values of x, each multi-particle state appears N! times in the integral. In other words, the probability associated with each event is evenly distributed across N! equivalent points in the integral space. Because it is usually more convenient to work with unrestricted integrals than restricted ones, the normalizing constant has been chosen to reflect this.     Finally, antisymmetric wavefunction can be written as the  |determinant|Determinant|  of a  |matrix|Matrix| , known as a  |Slater_determinant|Slater_Determinant| |bijective_relation|Bijective_Relation|  with irreducible subspaces of   H under Sn .     Two obvious irreducible subspaces are the one dimensional symmetric/bosonic subspace and anti-symmetric/fermionic subspace. There are however more types of irreducible subspaces. States associated with these other irreducible subspaces are called  |parastatistic_states|Parastatistics| .   |Young_tableaux|Young_Tableauapplications_In_Representation_Theory|  provide a way to classify all of these irreducible subspaces.               The indistinguishability of particles has a profound effect on their statistical properties. To illustrate this, consider a system of N distinguishable, non-interacting particles. Once again, let n j denote the state of particle j. If the particles have the same physical properties, the n j s run over the same range of values. Let ε denote the  |energy|Energy|  of a particle in state n. As the particles do not interact, the total energy of the system is the sum of the single-particle energies. The  |partition_function|Partition_Function|  of the system is     : Z         where k is  |Boltzmanns_constant|Boltzmanns_Constant|  and T is the  |temperature|Temperature| . This expression can be  |factored|Factorization|  to obtain     : Z       where     :           If the particles are identical, this equation is incorrect. Consider a state of the system, described by the single particle states n 1 , ..., n N . In the equation for Z, every possible permutation of the  .
