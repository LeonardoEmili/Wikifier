   Pierre Teilhard de Chardin   was a  |French_idealist|French_Idealism|  philosopher and  |Jesuit|Society_Of_Jesus| |priest|Catholic_Priesthood|  who trained as a  |paleontologist|Paleontology|  and  |geologist|Geology|  and took part in the discovery of the  |Peking_Man|Peking_Man| . He conceived the  |vitalist|Vitalism|  idea of the  |Omega_Point|Omega_Point|  , and he developed  |Vladimir_Vernadskys|Vladimir_Vernadsky|  concept of  |noosphere|Noosphere| .     Although a  monitum  was issued in regard to some of Teilhards ideas, he has been posthumously praised by  |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  and other eminent Catholic figures, and his theological teachings were cited by  |Pope_Francis|Pope_Francis|  in the 2015 encyclical,  Laudato si . The response to his writings by evolutionary biologists has been, with some exceptions, decidedly negative.         Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was born in the Château of Sarcenat,  |Orcines|Orcines| |commune|Communes_Of_France| , some 4  km north-west of  |Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-Ferrand| ,  |Auvergne|Auvergne| ,  |France|French_Third_Republic| , on 1 May 1881, as the fourth of eleven children of librarian Emmanuel Teilhard de Chardin and of Berthe-Adèle, née de Dompierre dHornoys of  |Picardy|Picardy| , a great-grandniece of  |Voltaire|Voltaire| .   He inherited the double surname from his father, who was descended on the Teilhard side from an ancient family of magistrates from  |Auvergne|Auvergne|  originating in  |Murat,_Cantal|Murat,_Cantal| , ennobled under  |Louis_XVIII|Louis_Xviii| . Paul Marichal , Emmanuel Teilhard de Chardin , Bibliothèque de lÉcole des chartes 93 , 416f.   Emmanuel Teilhard de Chardin was the son of Pierre-Cirice Teilhard and of Victoire Teilhard née Barron de Chardin.   The grandfather of Pierre-Cirice, Pierre Teilhard, was granted a letter of confirmation of nobility by  |Louis_XVIII|Louis_Xviii|  in 1816.   Amir Aczel, The Jesuit and the Skull ,  .     His father, an amateur  |naturalist|Naturalist| , collected stones, insects and plants and promoted the observation of nature in the household. Pierre Teilhards  |spirituality|Spirituality|  was awakened by his mother.   When he was 12, he went to the  |Jesuit|Jesuit|  college of Mongré, in  |Villefranche-sur-Saône|Villefranche-Sur-Saône| , where he completed  |baccalaureates|Baccalauréat|  of  |philosophy|Philosophy|  and  |mathematics|Mathematics| . Then, in 1899, he entered the Jesuit novitiate at  |Aix-en-Provence|Aix-En-Provence| , where he began a philosophical, theological and spiritual career.     When the  |Associations_Bill|Waldeck-Rousseau|  of 1901 required congregational associations to submit their properties to state control, some of the Jesuits exiled themselves in the United Kingdom. Young Jesuit students continued their studies in  |Jersey|Jersey| . In the meantime, Teilhard earned a licentiate in literature in  |Caen|Caen|  in 1902.       From 1905 to 1908, he taught  |physics|Physics|  and  |chemistry|Chemistry|  in  |Cairo|Cairo| , Egypt, at the  |Jesuit|Jesuit|  College of the Holy Family. He wrote ... it is the dazzling of the East foreseen and drunk greedily ... in its lights, its vegetation, its fauna and its deserts. Letters from Egypt  — Éditions Aubier     Teilhard studied theology in  |Hastings|Hastings| , in  |Sussex|Sussex| , from 1908 to 1912. There he synthesized his scientific, philosophical and theological knowledge in the light of  |evolution|Evolution| . At that time he read  LÉvolution Créatrice  by  |Henri_Bergson|Henri_Bergson| , about which he wrote that the only effect that brilliant book had upon me was to provide fuel at just the right moment, and very briefly, for a fire that was already consuming my heart and mind.  In short, Bergsons ideas helped him to unify his views on matter, life, and energy into a coherent and organic whole.       From 1912 to 1914, Teilhard worked in the  |paleontology|Paleontology|  laboratory of the  |Museum_National_dHistoire_Naturelle|Museum_National_Dhistoire_Naturelle|  in Paris, studying the  |mammals|Mammal|  of the middle  |tertiary|Tertiary|  period. Later he studied elsewhere in Europe. In June 1912 he formed part of the original digging team, with  |Arthur_Smith_Woodward|Arthur_Smith_Woodward|  and  |Charles_Dawson|Charles_Dawson| , at the  |Piltdown|Piltdown|  site, after the discovery of the first fragments of the  |Piltdown_Man|Piltdown_Man|  . Some have suggested he participated in the hoax.    |Marcellin_Boule|Marcellin_Boule| , a specialist in  |Neanderthal|Neanderthal|  studies, who as early as 1915 had recognized the non- |hominid|Hominid|  origins of the Piltdown finds, gradually guided Teilhard towards human paleontology. At the museums Institute of Human Paleontology, he became a friend of  |Henri_Breuil|Henri_Breuil|  and in 1913 took part with him in excavations at the prehistoric painted  |Caves_of_Castillo|Cuevas_De_El_Castillo|  in northwest Spain.       Mobilized in December 1914, Teilhard served in  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  as a stretcher-bearer in the  |8th_Moroccan_Rifles|French_Colonial_Forces| . For his valor, he received several citations, including the  |Médaille_militaire|Médaille_Militaire|  and the  |Legion_of_Honor|Légion_Dhonneur| .     During the war, he developed his reflections in his diaries and in letters to his cousin, Marguerite Teillard-Chambon, who later published a collection of them. Genèse dune pensée He later wrote: ...the war was a meeting ... with the Absolute. In 1916, he wrote his first essay: La Vie Cosmique , where his scientific and philosophical thought was revealed just as his mystical life. While on leave from the military he pronounced his solemn vows as a Jesuit in  |Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon|Sainte-Foy-Lès-Lyon|  on 26 May 1918. In August 1919, in  |Jersey|Jersey| , he wrote Puissance spirituelle de la Matière .     At the  |University_of_Paris|University_Of_Paris| , Teilhard pursued three unit degrees of natural science:  |geology|Geology| ,  |botany|Botany| , and  |zoology|Zoology| . His thesis treated the mammals of the French lower  |Eocene|Eocene|  and their  |stratigraphy|Stratigraphy| . After 1920, he lectured in geology at the  |Catholic_Institute_of_Paris|Catholic_Institute_Of_Paris|  and after earning a science doctorate in 1922 became an assistant professor there.       In 1923 he traveled to China with Father  |Emile_Licent|Emile_Licent| , who was in charge of a significant laboratory collaboration between the  |Natural_History_Museum|National_Museum_Of_Natural_History|  in Paris and Marcellin Boules laboratory in  |Tientsin|Tientsin| . Licent carried out considerable basic work in connection with missionaries who accumulated observations of a scientific nature in their spare time.     Teilhard wrote several essays, including La Messe sur le Monde , in the  |Ordos_Desert|Ordos_Desert| . In the following year, he continued lecturing at the Catholic Institute and participated in a cycle of conferences for the students of the Engineers Schools. Two theological essays on  |Original_Sin|Original_Sin|  were sent to a theologian at his request on a purely personal basis:   July 1920: Chute, Rédemption et Géocentrie    Spring 1922: Notes sur quelques représentations historiques possibles du Péché originel    The  |Church|Catholic_Church|  required him to give up his lecturing at the Catholic Institute in order to continue his geological research in China.     Teilhard traveled again to China in April 1926. He would remain there for about twenty years, with many voyages throughout the world. He settled until 1932 in  |Tientsin|Tianjin|  with Emile Licent, then in  |Beijing|Beijing| . Teilhard made five geological research expeditions in China between 1926 and 1935.   They enabled him to establish a general geological map of China. That same year, Teilhards superiors in the Jesuit Order forbade him to teach any longer.     In 1926–27, after a missed campaign in  |Gansu|Gansu| , Teilhard traveled in the  |Sang-Kan-Ho|Sang-Kan-Ho|  valley near Kalgan  and made a tour in Eastern  |Mongolia|Mongolia| . He wrote Le Milieu Divin . Teilhard prepared the first pages of his main work Le Phénomène Humain . The Holy See refused the Imprimatur for Le Milieu Divin in 1927.      He joined the ongoing excavations of the  |Peking_Man|Peking_Man|  Site at  |Zhoukoudian|Zhoukoudian|  as an advisor in 1926 and continued in the role for the  |Cenozoic_Research_Laboratory|Cenozoic_Research_Laboratory|  of the  |Geological_Survey_of_China|Geological_Survey_Of_China|  following its founding in 1928. Teilhard resided in  |Manchuria|Manchuria|  with Emile Licent, staying in Western Shansi  and northern Shensi  with the Chinese paleontologist  |C._C._Young|Yang_Zhongjian|  and with  |Davidson_Black|Davidson_Black| , Chairman of the  |Geological_Survey_of_China|Geological_Survey_Of_China| .     After a tour in Manchuria in the area of  |Great_Khingan|Great_Khingan|  with Chinese geologists, Teilhard joined the team of American Expedition Center-Asia in the  |Gobi_Desert|Gobi_Desert| , organized in June and July by the  |American_Museum_of_Natural_History|American_Museum_Of_Natural_History|  with  |Roy_Chapman_Andrews|Roy_Chapman_Andrews| . Henri Breuil and Teilhard discovered that the  |Peking_Man|Peking_Man| , the nearest relative of  Pithecanthropus  from  |Java|Java| , was a faber . Teilhard wrote LEsprit de la Terre .     Teilhard took part as a scientist in the  |Croisière_Jaune|Croisière_Jaune|  financed by  |André_Citroën|André_Citroën|  in  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| . Northwest of Beijing in  |Kalgan|Zhangjiakou| , he joined the Chinese group who joined the second part of the team, the  |Pamir|Pamir_Mountains|  group, in  |Aksu|Aksu,_Xinjiang| . He remained with his colleagues for several months in  |Ürümqi|Ürümqi| , capital of  |Sinkiang|Xinjiang| . The following year the  |Sino-Japanese_War|Second_Sino-Japanese_War|  began.     In 1933, Rome ordered him to give up his post in Paris. Teilhard subsequently undertook several explorations in the south of China. He traveled in the valleys of  |Yangtze_River|Yangtze_River|  and  |Sichuan|Sichuan|  in 1934, then, the following year, in  |Kwang-If|Kwang-If|  and  |Guangdong|Guangdong| . The relationship with Marcellin Boule was disrupted; the museum cut its financing on the grounds that Teilhard worked more for the Chinese Geological Service than for the museum.     During all these years, Teilhard contributed considerably to the constitution of an international network of research in human paleontology related to the whole of eastern and southeastern Asia. He would be particularly associated in this task with two friends, the English/Canadian Davidson Black and the  |Scot|Scot| |George_Brown_Barbour|George_Brown_Barbour| . Often he would visit France or the United States, only to leave these countries for further expeditions.            From 1927 to 1928, Teilhard based himself in Paris. He journeyed to  |Leuven|Leuven| , Belgium, and to  |Cantal|Cantal|  and  |Ariège|Ariège| , France. Between several articles in reviews, he met new people such as  |Paul_Valéry|Paul_Valéry|  and  |Bruno_de_Solages|Bruno_De_Solages| , who were to help him in issues with the  |Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| .     Answering an invitation from  |Henry_de_Monfreid|Henry_De_Monfreid| , Teilhard undertook a journey of two months in  |Obock|Obock| , in  |Harrar|Harrar|  and in  |Somalia|Somalia|  with his colleague  |Pierre_Lamarre|Pierre_Lamarre| , a geologist, before embarking in  |Djibouti|Djibouti|  to return to  |Tianjin|Tianjin| . While in China, Teilhard developed a deep and personal friendship with  |Lucile_Swan|Lucile_Swan| .      During 1930–1931, Teilhard stayed in France and in the United States. During a conference in Paris, Teilhard stated: For the observers of the Future, the greatest event will be the sudden appearance of a collective humane  |conscience|Conscience|  and a human work to make. From 1932–1933, he began to meet people to clarify issues with the  |Congregation_for_the_Doctrine_of_the_Faith|Congregation_For_The_Doctrine_Of_The_Faith| , regarding Le Milieu divin and LEsprit de la Terre. He met  |Helmut_de_Terra|Helmut_De_Terra| , a  |German|Germans|  geologist in the  |International_Geology_Congress|International_Union_Of_Geological_Sciences|  in  |Washington,_DC|Washington,_Dc| .     Teilhard participated in the 1935  |Yale|Yale_University| – |Cambridge|University_Of_Cambridge|  expedition in northern and central India with the geologist  |Helmut_de_Terra|Helmut_De_Terra|  and Patterson, who verified their assumptions on Indian  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  civilisations in  |Kashmir|Kashmir|  and the  |Salt_Range|Salt_Range|  Valley. He then made a short stay in  |Java|Java| , on the invitation of  |Dutch|Netherlands|  paleontologist  |Ralph_von_Koenigswald|Gustav_Heinrich_Ralph_Von_Koenigswald|  to the site of  |Java_man|Java_Man| . A second  |cranium|Human_Skull| , more complete, was discovered. Professor von Koenigswald had also found a tooth in a Chinese  |apothecary|Apothecary|  shop in 1934 that he believed belonged to a three-meter-tall  |ape|Ape| ,  Gigantopithecus , which lived between one hundred thousand and around a million years ago. Fossilized teeth and bone  are often ground into powder and used in some branches of  |traditional_Chinese_medicine|Traditional_Chinese_Medicine| .      In 1937, Teilhard wrote Le Phénomène spirituel  on board the boat Empress of Japan, where he met the  |Raja|Raja|  of  |Sarawak|Sarawak| . The ship conveyed him to the United States. He received the  |Mendel_Medal|Mendel_Medal|  granted by  |Villanova_University|Villanova_University|  during the Congress of  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| , in recognition of his works on human paleontology. He made a speech about  |evolution|Evolution| , the origins and the destiny of man.  The New York Times  dated 19 March 1937 presented Teilhard as the Jesuit who held that  |man|Human|  descended from  |monkeys|Monkeys| . Some days later, he was to be granted the  Doctor Honoris Causa  distinction from  |Boston_College|Boston_College| . Upon arrival in that city, he was told that the award had been cancelled.     Rome banned his work L’Énergie Humaine in 1939. By this point Teilhard was based again in France, where he was immobilized by  |malaria|Malaria| . During his return voyage to Beijing he wrote LEnergie spirituelle de la Souffrance  .     In 1941, Teilhard submitted to Rome his most important work, Le Phénomène Humain. By 1947, Rome forbade him to write or teach on philosophical subjects. The next year, Teilhard was called to Rome by the Superior General of the Jesuits who hoped to acquire permission from the Holy See for the publication of Le Phénomène Humain. However, the prohibition to publish it that was previously issued in 1944 was again renewed. Teilhard was also forbidden to take a teaching post in the Collège de France. Another setback came in 1949, when permission to publish Le Groupe Zoologique was refused.     Teilhard was nominated to the  |French_Academy_of_Sciences|French_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in 1950. He was forbidden by his Superiors to attend the International Congress of   Paleontology in 1955. The Supreme Authority of the Holy Office, in a decree dated 15 November 1957, forbade the works of de Chardin to be retained in libraries, including those of  |religious_institutes|Religious_Institute| . His books were not to be sold in Catholic bookshops and were not to be translated into other languages.     Further resistance to Teilhards work arose elsewhere. In April 1958, all Jesuit publications in Spain carried a notice from the Spanish Provincial of the Jesuits that Teilhards works had been published in Spanish without previous ecclesiastical examination and in defiance of the decrees of the Holy See. A decree of the Holy Office dated 30 June 1962, under the authority of Pope John XXIII, warned that ... it is obvious that in philosophical and theological matters, the said works are replete with ambiguities or rather with serious errors which offend Catholic doctrine. That is why... the Rev. Fathers of the Holy Office urge all Ordinaries, Superiors, and Rectors... to effectively protect, especially the minds of the young, against the dangers of the works of Fr. Teilhard de Chardin and his followers .     The  |Diocese_of_Rome|Roman_Catholic_Diocese_Of_Rome|  on 30 September 1963 required Catholic booksellers in Rome to withdraw his works as well as those that supported his views. The text of this decree was published in daily L’Aurore of Paris, dated 2 October 1963, and was reproduced in Nouvelles De Chrétienté, 10 October 1963, p.  35.          Teilhard died in New York City, where he was in residence at the Jesuit  |Church_of_St._Ignatius_Loyola|Church_Of_St._Ignatius_Loyola| ,  |Park_Avenue|Park_Avenue| . On 15 March 1955, at the house of his diplomat cousin Jean de Lagarde, Teilhard told friends he hoped he would die on  |Easter_Sunday|Easter_Sunday| .  On the evening of Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, during an animated discussion at the apartment of Rhoda de Terra, his personal assistant since 1949, Teilhard suffered a heart attack and died. He was buried in the cemetery for the New York Province of the Jesuits at the Jesuit novitiate,  |St._Andrew-on-Hudson|St._Andrew-On-Hudson| , in  |Hyde_Park,_New_York|Hyde_Park,_New_York| . With the moving of the novitiate, the property was sold to the  |Culinary_Institute_of_America|Hyde_Park_Campus_Of_The_Culinary_Institute_Of_America|  in 1970.       Teilhard de Chardin wrote two comprehensive works,  The Phenomenon of Man  and The Divine Milieu.      His posthumously published book, The Phenomenon of Man, set forth a sweeping account of the unfolding of the  |cosmos|Cosmos|  and the evolution of matter to humanity, to ultimately a reunion with Christ. In the book, Teilhard abandoned literal interpretations of creation in the  |Book_of_Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis|  in favor of allegorical and theological interpretations. The unfolding of the material  |cosmos|Cosmos|  is described from  |primordial|Primordial_Nuclide|  particles to the development of life, human beings and the  |noosphere|Noosphere| , and finally to his vision of the  |Omega_Point|Omega_Point|  in the future, which is pulling all creation towards it. He was a leading proponent of  |orthogenesis|Orthogenesis| , the idea that  |evolution|Evolution|  occurs in a directional, goal-driven way. Teilhard argued in  |Darwin|Charles_Darwin| ian terms with respect to biology, and supported the  |synthetic_model_of_evolution|Modern_Synthesis| , but argued in  |Lamarckian_terms|Lamarckism|  for the development of culture, primarily through the vehicle of education.  by . Teilhard made a total commitment to the evolutionary process in the 1920s as the core of his spirituality, at a time when other religious thinkers felt evolutionary thinking challenged the structure of conventional Christian faith. He committed himself to what the evidence showed. Berry, Thomas Teilard de Chardin in the Age of Ecology     Teilhard made sense of the  |universe|Universe|  by assuming it had a  |vitalist|Vitalism|  evolutionary process.   He interprets complexity as the axis of evolution of matter into a geosphere, a biosphere, into consciousness , and then to supreme consciousness .     Teilhards unique relationship to both  |paleontology|Paleontology|  and  |Catholicism|Catholicism|  allowed him to develop a highly progressive,  |cosmic_theology|Cosmic_Christ|  which takes into account his evolutionary studies. Teilhard recognized the importance of bringing the Church into the modern world, and approached  |evolution|Evolution|  as a way of providing ontological meaning for Christianity, particularly creation theology. For Teilhard, evolution was the natural landscape where the history of salvation is situated.      Teilhards cosmic theology is largely predicated on his interpretation of  |Pauline_scripture|Paul_The_Apostle| , particularly Colossians 1:15-17 and 1 Corinthians 15:28. He drew on the Christocentrism of these two Pauline passages to construct a cosmic theology which recognizes the absolute primacy of Christ. He understood creation to be a  |teleological|Teleology|  process towards union with the Godhead, effected through the incarnation and redemption of Christ, in whom all things hold together .  He further posited that creation would not be complete until each participated being is totally united with God through Christ in the  |Pleroma|Pleroma| , when God will be all in all .     Teilhards life work was predicated on his conviction that human spiritual development is moved by the same universal laws as material development. He wrote, ...everything is the sum of the past and ...nothing is comprehensible except through its history. Nature is the equivalent of becoming, self-creation: this is the view to which experience irresistibly leads us. ... There is nothing, not even the human soul, the highest spiritual manifestation we know of, that does not come within this universal law. Teilhard de Chardin:  The Phenomenon of Man represents Teilhards attempt at reconciling his religious  |faith|Catholicism|  with his academic interests as a  |paleontologist|Paleontologist| . Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, The Phenomenon of Man , 250–75. One particularly poignant observation in Teilhards book entails the notion that  |evolution|Evolution|  is becoming an increasingly optional  |process|Process| . Teilhard points to the societal problems of  |isolation|Solitude|  and  |marginalization|Marginalization|  as huge  |inhibitors|:Wikt:Inhibit|  of evolution, especially since evolution requires a unification of  |consciousness|Higher_Consciousness| . He states that no evolutionary future awaits anyone except in association with everyone else. Teilhard argued that the human condition necessarily leads to the psychic unity of humankind, though he stressed that this unity can only be voluntary; this voluntary psychic unity he termed unanimization. Teilhard also states that evolution is an ascent toward consciousness , giving  |encephalization|Encephalization|  as an example of early stages, and therefore, signifies a continuous upsurge toward the  |Omega_Point|Omega_Point|  which, for all intents and purposes, is  |God|God| .     Teilhard also used his perceived correlation between spiritual and material to describe Christ, arguing that Christ not only has a  |mystical|Mystical|  dimension but also takes on a physical dimension as he becomes the organizing principle of the universe—that is, the one who holds together the universe . For Teilhard, Christ forms not only the  |eschatological|Eschatological|  end toward which his mystical/ecclesial body is oriented, but he also operates physically in order to regulate all things  becoming the one from whom all creation receives its stability.  In other words, as the one who holds all things together, Christ exercises a supremacy over the universe which is physical, not simply juridical. He is the unifying center of the universe and its goal. The function of holding all things together indicates that Christ is not only man and God; he also possesses a third aspect—indeed, a third nature—which is cosmic.  In this way, the Pauline description of the  |Body_of_Christ|Body_Of_Christ|  is not simply a mystical or  |ecclesial|Ecclesial|  concept for Teilhard; it is  |cosmic|Cosmic_Christ| . This cosmic Body of Christ extend throughout the universe and compris all things that attain their fulfillment in Christ ... the Body of Christ is the one single thing that is being made in creation.  Teilhard describes this cosmic amassing of Christ as Christogenesis. According to Teilhard, the universe is engaged in Christogenesis as it evolves toward its full realization at  |Omega|Omega_Point| , a point which coincides with the fully realized Christ. It is at this point that God will be all in all .              In 1925, Teilhard was ordered by the  |Jesuit_Superior_General|Father_General| |Wlodimir_Ledóchowski|Wlodimir_Ledóchowski|  to leave his teaching position in France and to sign a statement withdrawing his controversial statements regarding the doctrine of  |original_sin|Original_Sin| . Rather than leave the Society of Jesus, Teilhard signed the statement and left for China.     This was the first of a series of condemnations by certain  |ecclesiastical|Ecclesiastical|  officials that would continue until after Teilhards death. The climax of these condemnations was a 1962  monitum  of the  |Holy_Office|Congregation_For_The_Doctrine_Of_The_Faith|  cautioning on Teilhards works. It said:           The Holy Office did not place any of Teilhards writings on the  Index Librorum Prohibitorum  , which existed during Teilhards lifetime and at the time of the 1962 decree.     Shortly thereafter, prominent clerics mounted a strong theological defense of Teilhards works.  |Henri_de_Lubac|Henri_De_Lubac|  wrote three comprehensive books on the theology of Teilhard de Chardin in the 1960s. Wojciech Sadłoń, Teologia Teilharda de Chardin. Studium nad komentarzami Henri de Lubaca, Warszawa, UKSW 2009 While de Lubac mentioned that Teilhard was less than precise in some of his concepts, he affirmed the orthodoxy of Teilhard de Chardin and responded to Teilhards critics: We need not concern ourselves with a number of detractors of Teilhard, in whom emotion has blunted intelligence . Cardinal Henri Cardinal de Lubac  – The Religion of Teilhard de Chardin, Image Books Later that decade  |Joseph_Ratzinger|Joseph_Ratzinger| , a German theologian who became Pope Benedict XVI, spoke glowingly of Teilhards Christology in Ratzingers Introduction to Christianity     Over the next several decades prominent theologians and prelates, including leading cardinals,  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii|  and  |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  all wrote approvingly of Teilhards ideas. In 1981, Cardinal  |Agostino_Casaroli|Agostino_Casaroli| , on behalf of  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii| , wrote on the front page of the Vatican newspaper, lOsservatore Romano     Cardinal  |Avery_Dulles|Avery_Dulles|  said in 2004: A Eucharistic Church: The Vision of John Paul II  – McGinley Lecture, University, 10 November 2004        Cardinal  |Christoph_Schönborn|Christoph_Schönborn|  wrote in 2007: Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, Creation, Evolution, and a Rational Faith, Ignatian Press         |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  in his book Spirit of the Liturgy incorporates Teilhards vision as a touchstone of the Catholic Mass: – Ratzinger, Joseph Cardinal; Pope Benedict XVI . The Spirit of the Liturgy . Ignatius Press. Kindle Edition.        in July 2009, Vatican spokesman  |Federico_Lombardi|Federico_Lombardi|  said, By now, no one would dream of saying that is a heterodox author who shouldnt be studied.       |Pope_Francis|Pope_Francis|  refers to Teilhards eschatological contribution in his encyclical  |Laudato_si|Laudato_Si| .      The philosopher  |Dietrich_von_Hildebrand|Dietrich_Von_Hildebrand|  criticized severely the work of Teilhard. According to this philosopher, in a conversation after a lecture by Teilhard: He ignored completely the decisive difference between nature and supernature. After a lively discussion in which I ventured a criticism of his ideas, I had an opportunity to speak to Teilhard privately. When our talk touched on  |St._Augustine|Augustine_Of_Hippo| , he exclaimed violently: Don’t mention that unfortunate man; he spoiled everything by introducing the supernatural.  Von Hildebrand writes that Teilhardism is incompatible with Christianity, substitutes efficiency for sanctity, dehumanizes man, and describes love as merely cosmic energy.         According to  |Daniel_Dennett|Daniel_Dennett|  , it has become clear to the point of unanimity among scientists that Teilhard offered nothing serious in the way of an alternative to orthodoxy; the ideas that were peculiarly his were confused, and the rest was just bombastic redescription of orthodoxy.     |Steven_Rose|Steven_Rose|  wrote that Teilhard is revered as a mystic of genius by some, but amongst most biologists is seen as little more than a  |charlatan|Charlatan| .      In 1961, British immunologist and Nobel laureate  |Peter_Medawar|Peter_Medawar|  wrote a scornful review of The Phenomenon Of Man for the journal  Mind  the greater part of it, I shall show, is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself ; In spite of all the obstacles that Teilhard perhaps wisely puts in our way, it is possible to discern a train of thought in The Phenomenon of Man . Evolutionary biologist  |Richard_Dawkins|Richard_Dawkins|  called Medawars review devastating and The Phenomenon of Man the quintessence of bad poetic science .       |Sir_Julian_Huxley|Julian_Huxley| , the evolutionary biologist, in the preface to the 1955 edition of The Phenomenon of Man, praised the thought of Teilhard de Chardin for looking at the way in which human development needs to be examined within a larger integrated universal sense of evolution, though admitting he could not follow Teilhard all the way. Huxley, Julian Preface to Teilhard de Chardin, Teilhard The Phenomenon of Man    |Theodosius_Dobzhansky|Theodosius_Dobzhansky| , writing in 1973, drew upon Teilhards insistence that evolutionary theory provides the core of how man understands his relationship to nature, calling him one of the great thinkers of our age . ; reprinted in     |David_Sloan_Wilson|David_Sloan_Wilson| , an evolutionary biologist, in a 2012 interview judged that Teilhard remains amazingly relevan even though he has been largely forgotten as a scientist , and that he had anticipated his own work in  |multilevel_selection_theory|Group_Selectionmultilevel_Selection_Theory| .       |George_Gaylord_Simpson|George_Gaylord_Simpson|  felt that if Teilhard were right, the lifework of Huxley, Dobzhansky, and hundreds of others was not only wrong, but meaningless , and was mystified by their public support for him.  He considered Teilhard a friend and his work in paleontology extensive and important, but expressed strongly adverse views of his contributions as scientific theorist and philosopher.           |Brian_Swimme|Brian_Swimme|  wrote Teilhard was one of the first scientists to realize that the human and the universe are inseparable. The only universe we know about is a universe that brought forth the human. Introduction by Brian Swimme, in The Human Phenomenon by Teilhard de Chardin, trans.
