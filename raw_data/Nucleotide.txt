Nucleotides are  |molecules|Molecule|  consisting of a  |nucleoside|Nucleoside|  and a  |phosphate_group|Phosphate_Group| . They are the basic building blocks of  |DNA|Dna|  and  |RNA|Rna| .     They are  |organic_molecules|Organic_Molecule|  that serve as the  |monomer|Monomer|  units for forming the  |nucleic_acid|Nucleic_Acid| |polymers|Polymers| |deoxyribonucleic_acid|Deoxyribonucleic_Acid|  and  |ribonucleic_acid|Ribonucleic_Acid|  , both of which are essential  |biomolecules|Biomolecules|  within all  |life-forms|Rna_Worldprebiotic_Rna_Synthesis|  on Earth. Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids; they are composed of three sub unit molecules: a  |nitrogenous_base|Nitrogenous_Base|  , a  |five-carbon_sugar|Pentose|  , and at least one  |phosphate_group|Phosphate_Group| .     Nucleotides also play a central role in  |metabolism|Metabolism|  at a fundamental, cellular level. They carry packets of chemical energy—in the form of the  |nucleoside_triphosphates|Nucleoside_Triphosphate| |Adenosine_triphosphate|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  ,  |Guanosine_triphosphate|Guanosine_Triphosphate|  ,  |Cytidine_triphosphate|Cytidine_Triphosphate|  and  |Uridine_triphosphate|Uridine_Triphosphate|  —throughout the cell to the many cellular functions that demand energy, which include: synthesizing  |amino_acids|Amino_Acids| ,  |proteins|Protein|  and  |cell_membranes_and_parts|Cell_Membranes| , moving the cell and moving cell parts , dividing the cell, etc. Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K & Walter P . Molecular Biology of the Cell . Garland Science. . pp. 120–121. In addition, nucleotides participate in  |cell_signaling|Cell_Signaling|  , and are incorporated into important  |cofactors|Cofactor|  of enzymatic reactions .     In experimental  |biochemistry|Biochemistry| , nucleotides can be  |radiolabeled|Radiolabeled|  with  |radionuclides|Radionuclide|  to yield radionucleotides.            A nucleo tide is composed of three distinctive chemical sub-units: a five-carbon sugar molecule, a  |nitrogenous_base|Nitrogenous_Base| —which two together are called a  |nucleo_side|Nucleoside| —and one  |phosphate_group|Phosphate_Group| . With all three joined, a nucleotide is also termed a nucleo side monophosphate . The chemistry sources  |ACS_Style_Guide|Acs_Style_Guide|   and  |IUPAC_Gold_Book|Iupac_Gold_Book|   prescribe that a nucleotide should contain only one phosphate group, but common usage in molecular biology textbooks often extends the definition to include molecules with two, or with three, phosphates.    Thus, the terms nucleoside diphosphate or nucleoside triphosphate may also indicate nucleotides.     Nucleotides contain either a  |purine|Purine|  or a  |pyrimidine|Pyrimidine|  base—i.e., the nitrogenous base molecule, also known as a  |nucleobase|Nucleobase| —and are termed ribonucleotides if the sugar is ribose, or deoxyribonucleotides if the sugar is deoxyribose. Individual phosphate molecules repetitively connect the  |sugar-ring|Ribose|  molecules in two adjacent nucleotide monomers, thereby connecting the nucleotide monomers of a nucleic acid end-to-end into a long chain. These chain-joins of sugar and phosphate molecules create a backbone strand for a single- or  |double_helix|Double_Helix| . In any one strand, the chemical orientation  of the chain-joins runs from the 5-end to the 3-end —referring to the five carbon sites on sugar molecules in adjacent nucleotides. In a double helix, the two strands are oriented in opposite directions, which permits  |base_pairing|Base_Pairing|  and  |complementarity|Complementarity|  between the base-pairs, all which is essential for  |replicating|Dna_Replication|  or  |transcribing|Transcription|  the encoded information found in DNA.     Unlike in nucleic acid nucleotides, singular  |cyclic_nucleotides|Cyclic_Nucleotides|  are formed when the phosphate group is bound twice to the same sugar molecule, i.e., at the corners of the sugar  |hydroxyl_groups|Hydroxyl_Group| . These individual nucleotides function in cell metabolism rather than the nucleic acid structures of long-chain molecules.      |Nucleic_acids|Nucleic_Acid|  then are  |polymeric|Polymeric| |macromolecules|Macromolecule|  assembled from nucleotides, the  |monomer-units_of_nucleic_acids|Monomer| . The purine bases  |adenine|Adenine|  and  |guanine|Guanine|  and pyrimidine base  |cytosine|Cytosine|  occur in both DNA and RNA, while the pyrimidine bases  |thymine|Thymine|  and  |uracil|Uracil|  occur in just one. Adenine forms a  |base_pair|Base_Pair|  with thymine with two hydrogen bonds, while guanine pairs with cytosine with three hydrogen bonds.            Nucleotides can be synthesized by a variety of means both  |in_vitro|In_Vitro|  and  |in_vivo|In_Vivo| .     In vitro,  |protecting_groups|Protecting_Group|  may be used during laboratory production of nucleotides. A purified  |nucleoside|Nucleoside|  is protected to create a  |phosphoramidite|Phosphoramidite| , which can then be used to obtain analogues not found in nature and/or to  |synthesize_an_oligonucleotide|Oligonucleotide_Synthesis| .     In vivo, nucleotides can be synthesized  |de_novo|De_Novo_Synthesis|  or recycled through  |salvage_pathways|Nucleotide_Salvage| .  The components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  metabolism, and from ammonia and carbon dioxide. The liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides. De novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways. Pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl-phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid, onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked. Purines, however, are first synthesized from the sugar template onto which the ring synthesis occurs. For reference, the syntheses of the  |purine|Purine|  and  |pyrimidine|Pyrimidine|  nucleotides are carried out by several enzymes in the  |cytoplasm|Cytoplasm|  of the cell, not within a specific  |organelle|Organelle| . Nucleotides undergo breakdown such that useful parts can be reused in synthesis reactions to create new nucleotides.                 The synthesis of the pyrimidines CTP and UTP occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from  |glutamine|Glutamine|  and CO 2 . Next,  |aspartate_carbamoyltransferase|Aspartate_Carbamoyltransferase|  catalyzes a condensation reaction between  |aspartate|Aspartate|  and  |carbamoyl_phosphate|Carbamoyl_Phosphate|  to form  |carbamoyl_aspartic_acid|Carbamoyl_Aspartic_Acid| , which is cyclized into  |4,5-dihydroorotic_acid|4,5-Dihydroorotic_Acid|  by  |dihydroorotase|Dihydroorotase| . The latter is converted to  |orotate|Orotate|  by  |dihydroorotate_oxidase|Dihydroorotate_Oxidase| . The net reaction is:     :-Dihydroorotate + O 2 → Orotate + H 2 O 2     Orotate is covalently linked with a phosphorylated ribosyl unit. The covalent linkage between the ribose and pyrimidine occurs at position C 1 See  |IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry|Iupac_Nomenclature_Of_Organic_Chemistry|  for details on carbon residue numbering of the  |ribose|Ribose|  unit, which contains a  |pyrophosphate|Pyrophosphate| , and N 1 of the pyrimidine ring.  |Orotate_phosphoribosyltransferase|Orotate_Phosphoribosyltransferase|  catalyzes the net reaction yielding orotidine monophosphate :     :Orotate +  |5-Phospho-α-D-ribose_1-diphosphate|Phosphoribosyl_Pyrophosphate|  → Orotidine 5-phosphate + Pyrophosphate      |Orotidine_5-monophosphate|Orotidine_5-Monophosphate|  is decarboxylated by orotidine-5-phosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate . PRPP transferase catalyzes both the ribosylation and decarboxylation reactions, forming UMP from orotic acid in the presence of PRPP. It is from UMP that other pyrimidine nucleotides are derived. UMP is phosphorylated by two kinases to uridine triphosphate via two sequential reactions with ATP. First the diphosphate form UDP is produced, which in turn is phosphorylated to UTP. Both steps are fueled by ATP hydrolysis:     :ATP + UMP → ADP + UDP     :UDP + ATP → UTP + ADP     CTP is subsequently formed by amination of UTP by the catalytic activity of  |CTP_synthetase|Ctp_Synthetase| . Glutamine is the NH 3 donor and the reaction is fueled by ATP hydrolysis, too:     :UTP + Glutamine + ATP + H 2 O → CTP + ADP + P i     Cytidine monophosphate is derived from cytidine triphosphate with subsequent loss of two phosphates.                    The atoms that are used to build the  |purine_nucleotides|Purine_Nucleotides|  come from a variety of sources:           The  |de_novo_synthesis|De_Novo_Synthesis|  of  |purine_nucleotides|Purine_Nucleotides|  by which these precursors are incorporated into the purine ring proceeds by a 10-step pathway to the branch-point intermediate  |IMP|Inosine_Monophosphate| , the nucleotide of the base  |hypoxanthine|Hypoxanthine| .  |AMP|Adenosine_Monophosphate|  and  |GMP|Guanosine_Monophosphate|  are subsequently synthesized from this intermediate via separate, two-step pathways. Thus, purine  |moieties|Moiety|  are initially formed as part of the  |ribonucleotides|Ribonucleotides|  rather than as  |free_bases|Freebase| .     Six enzymes take part in IMP synthesis. Three of them are multifunctional:    |GART|Phosphoribosylglycinamide_Formyltransferase| |PAICS|Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole_Carboxylase| |ATIC|Inosine_Monophosphate_Synthase|      The pathway starts with the formation of  |PRPP|Prpp| .  |PRPS1|Prps1|  is the  |enzyme|Enzyme|  that activates  |R5P|R5P| , which is formed primarily by the  |pentose_phosphate_pathway|Pentose_Phosphate_Pathway| , to  |PRPP|Prpp|  by reacting it with  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate| . The reaction is unusual in that a pyrophosphoryl group is directly transferred from ATP to C 1 of  |R5P|R5P|  and that the product has the α configuration about C1. This reaction is also shared with the pathways for the synthesis of  |Trp|Tryptophan| ,  |His|Histidine| , and the  |pyrimidine_nucleotides|Pyrimidine_Nucleotides| . Being on a major metabolic crossroad and requiring much energy, this reaction is highly regulated.     In the first reaction unique to purine nucleotide biosynthesis,  |PPAT|Ppat|  catalyzes the displacement of  |PRPPs|Prpp| |pyrophosphate|Pyrophosphate|  group by an amide nitrogen donated from either  |glutamine|Glutamine|  ,  |glycine|Glycine|  ,  |aspartate|Aspartate|  ,  |folic_acid|Folic_Acid|  , or CO 2 . This is the committed step in purine synthesis. The reaction occurs with the inversion of configuration about ribose C 1 , thereby forming β- |5-phosphorybosylamine|5-Phosphorybosylamine|  and establishing the anomeric form of the future nucleotide.     Next, a glycine is incorporated fueled by ATP hydrolysis and the carboxyl group forms an amine bond to the NH 2 previously introduced. A one-carbon unit from folic acid coenzyme N 10 -formyl-THF is then added to the amino group of the substituted glycine followed by the closure of the imidazole ring. Next, a second NH 2 group is transferred from a glutamine to the first carbon of the glycine unit. A carboxylation of the second carbon of the glycin unit is concomitantly added. This new carbon is modified by the additional of a third NH 2 unit, this time transferred from an aspartate residue. Finally, a second one-carbon unit from formyl-THF is added to the nitrogen group and the ring covalently closed to form the common purine precursor inosine monophosphate .     Inosine monophosphate is converted to adenosine monophosphate in two steps. First, GTP hydrolysis fuels the addition of aspartate to IMP by adenylosuccinate synthase, substituting the carbonyl oxygen for a nitrogen and forming the intermediate adenylosuccinate. Fumarate is then cleaved off forming adenosine monophosphate. This step is catalyzed by adenylosuccinate lyase.     Inosine monophosphate is converted to guanosine monophosphate by the oxidation of IMP forming xanthylate, followed by the insertion of an amino group at C 2 . NAD + is the electron acceptor in the oxidation reaction. The amide group transfer from glutamine is fueled by ATP hydrolysis.       In humans, pyrimidine rings can be degraded completely to CO 2 and NH 3 . That having been said, purine rings cannot. Instead they are degraded to the metabolically inert  |uric_acid|Uric_Acid|  which is then excreted from the body. Uric acid is formed when GMP is split into the base guanine and ribose. Guanine is deaminated to xanthine which in turn is oxidized to uric acid. This last reaction is irreversible. Similarly, uric acid can be formed when AMP is deaminated to IMP from which the ribose unit is removed to form hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is oxidized to xanthine and finally to uric acid. Instead of uric acid secretion, guanine and IMP can be used for recycling purposes and nucleic acid synthesis in the presence of PRPP and aspartate .            An unnatural base pair is a designed subunit  of  |DNA|Dna|  which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature. In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the  |Scripps_Research_Institute|Scripps_Research_Institute|  in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair .  The two new artificial nucleotides or Unnatural Base Pair were named  d5SICS  and  dNaM . More technically, these artificial nucleotides bearing hydrophobic  |nucleobases|Nucleobase| , feature two fused  |aromatic_rings|Aromatic_Hydrocarbon|  that form a complex or base pair in DNA.  In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a  |plasmid|Plasmid|  containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesbergs laboratory had designed, and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium E. coli that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations.  This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations.   This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive algal gene that expresses a  |nucleotide_triphosphate|Nucleoside_Triphosphate|  transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into E. coli bacteria. Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate the  |plasmid|Plasmid|  containing d5SICS–dNaM.     The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of amino acids which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 21 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel  |proteins|Protein| . The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses.        Nucleotide is a common unit of length for single-stranded nucleic acids, similar to how  |base_pair|Base_Pair|  is a unit of length for double-stranded nucleic acids.       A study done by the Department of Sports Science at the University of Hull in Hull, UK has shown that nucleotides have significant impact on  |cortisol|Cortisol|  levels in saliva. Post exercise, the experimental nucleotide group had lower cortisol levels in their blood than the control or the placebo. Additionally, post supplement values of  |Immunoglobulin_A|Immunoglobulin_A|  were significantly higher than either the placebo or the control. The study concluded, nucleotide supplementation blunts the response of the hormones associated with physiological stress.      Another study conducted in 2013 looked at the impact nucleotide supplementation had on the immune system in athletes. In the study, all athletes were male and were highly skilled in  |taekwondo|Taekwondo| . Out of the twenty athletes tested, half received a placebo and half received 480  mg per day of nucleotide supplement. After thirty days, the study concluded that nucleotide supplementation may counteract the impairment of the bodys immune function after heavy exercise.           The  |IUPAC|Iupac|  has designated the symbols for nucleotides.  Apart from the five bases, often degenerate bases are used especially for designing  |PCR_primers|Primer| . These nucleotide codes are listed here. Some primer sequences may also include the character I , which codes for the non-standard nucleotide  |inosine|Inosine| . Inosine occurs in tRNAs, and will pair with adenine, cytosine, or thymine. This character does not appear in the following table however, because it does not represent a degeneracy. While inosine can serve a similar function as the degeneracy D , it is an actual nucleotide, rather than a representation of a mix of nucleotides that covers each possible pairing needed.
