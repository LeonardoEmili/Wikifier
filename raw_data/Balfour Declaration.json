The Jewish population will be secured in the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, equal political rights with the rest of the population, reasonable facilities for immigration and colonisation, and such municipal privileges in the towns and colonies inhabited by them as may be shown to be necessary.     On 11 March, telegrams  were sent in Greys name to Britains Russian and French ambassadors for transmission to Russian and French authorities, including the formula, as well as :     The scheme might be made far more attractive to the majority of Jews if it held out to them the prospect that when in course of time the Jewish colonists in Palestine grow strong enough to cope with the Arab population they may be allowed to take the management of the internal affairs of Palestine into their own hands.     Sykes, having seen the telegram, had discussions with Picot and proposed  the creation of an Arab Sultanate under French and British protection, some means of administering the holy places along with the establishment of a company to purchase land for Jewish colonists, who would then become citizens with equal rights to Arabs.     Shortly after returning from Petrograd, Sykes briefed Samuel, who then briefed a meeting of Gaster, Weizmann and Sokolow. Gaster recorded in his diary on 16 April 1916: We are offered French-English condominium in Palest Arab Prince to conciliate Arab sentiment and as part of the Constitution a Charter to Zionists for which England would stand guarantee and which would stand by us in every case of friction... It practically comes to a complete realisation of our Zionist programme. However, we insisted on: national character of Charter, freedom of immigration and internal autonomy, and at the same time full rights of citizenship to and Jews in Palestine.  In Sykes mind, the agreement which bore his name was outdated even before it was signed – in March 1916, he wrote in a private letter: to my mind the Zionists are now the key of the situation . In the event, neither the French nor the Russians were enthusiastic about the proposed formulation and eventually on 4 July, Wolf was informed that the present moment is inopportune for making any announcement.      These wartime initiatives, inclusive of the declaration, are frequently considered together by historians because of the potential, real or imagined, for incompatibility between them, particularly in regard to the disposition of Palestine.

There was a very strong and enthusiastic organisation, more particularly in the United States, who were zealous in this matter, and his belief was that it would be of most substantial assistance to the Allies to have the earnestness and enthusiasm of these people enlisted on our side. To do nothing was to risk a direct breach with them, and it was necessary to face this situation.  4 October 1917: ... stated that the German Government were making great efforts to capture the sympathy of the Zionist Movement.

The term national home was intentionally ambiguous, having no legal value or precedent in international law, such that its meaning was unclear when compared to other terms such as state .

An official report to the War Cabinet sent by Sykes on 22 September said that the Zionists did not want to set up a Jewish Republic or any other form of state in Palestine or in any part of Palestine but rather preferred some form of protectorate as provided in the Palestine Mandate. A month later, Curzon produced a memorandum circulated on 26 October 1917 where he addressed two questions, the first concerning the meaning of the phrase a National Home for the Jewish race in Palestine ; he noted that there were different opinions ranging from a fully fledged state to a merely spiritual centre for the Jews.     Sections of the British press assumed that a Jewish state was intended even before the Declaration was finalized.

When Chaim Weizmann met with Churchill, Lloyd George and Balfour at Balfours home in London on 21 July 1921, Lloyd George and Balfour assured Weizmann that by the Declaration they had always meant an eventual Jewish State, according to Weizmann minutes of that meeting.  Lloyd George stated in 1937 that it was intended that Palestine would become a Jewish Commonwealth if and when Jews had become a definite majority of the inhabitants , and Leo Amery echoed the same position in 1946. In the UNSCOP report of 1947, the issue of home versus state was subjected to scrutiny arriving at a similar conclusion to that of Lloyd George.         The statement that such a homeland would be found in Palestine rather than of Palestine was also deliberate. The proposed draft of the declaration contained in Rothschilds 12 July letter to Balfour referred to the principle that Palestine should be reconstituted as the National Home of the Jewish people.  In the final text, following Lord Milners amendment, the word reconstituted was removed and the word that was replaced with in .

In 1919, King Hussein refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. After February, 1920, the British ceased to pay subsidy to him. In August, 1920, five days after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, which formally recognized the Kingdom of Hejaz, Curzon asked Cairo to procure Husseins signature to both treaties and agreed to make a payment of £30,000 conditional on signature. Hussein declined and in 1921, stated that he could not be expected to affix his name to a document assigning Palestine to the Zionists and Syria to foreigners.  Following the 1921 Cairo Conference, Lawrence was sent to try and obtain the Kings signature to a treaty as well as to Versailles and Sèvres, a £60,000 annual subsidy being proposed; this attempt also failed. During 1923, the British made one further attempt to settle outstanding issues with Hussein and once again, the attempt foundered, Hussein continued in his refusal to recognize the Balfour Declaration or any of the Mandates that he perceived as being his domain.
