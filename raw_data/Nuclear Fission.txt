         In  |nuclear_physics|Nuclear_Physics|  and  |nuclear_chemistry|Nuclear_Chemistry| , nuclear fission is a  |nuclear_reaction|Nuclear_Reaction|  or a  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay|  process in which the  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  of an atom splits into two or more smaller, lighter  |nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus| . The fission process often produces  |gamma|Gamma_Ray| |photons|Photon| , and releases a very large amount of  |energy|Energy|  even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.     Nuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered on December 17, 1938 by German  |Otto_Hahn|Otto_Hahn|  and his assistant  |Fritz_Strassmann|Fritz_Strassmann| , and explained theoretically in January 1939 by  |Lise_Meitner|Lise_Meitner|  and her nephew  |Otto_Robert_Frisch|Otto_Robert_Frisch| . Frisch named the process by analogy with  |biological_fission|Fission|  of living cells. For heavy  |nuclides|Nuclide| , it is an  |exothermic_reaction|Exothermic_Reaction|  which can release large amounts of  |energy|Energy|  both as  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation|  and as  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of the fragments . In order for fission to produce energy, the total  |binding_energy|Nuclear_Binding_Energy|  of the resulting elements must be more negative than that of the starting element.     Fission is a form of  |nuclear_transmutation|Nuclear_Transmutation|  because the resulting fragments are not the same  |element|Chemical_Element|  as the original atom. The two nuclei produced are most often of comparable but slightly different sizes, typically with a mass ratio of products of about 3 to 2, for common  |fissile|Fissile| |isotopes|Isotope| .   Most fissions are binary fissions , but occasionally , three positively charged fragments are produced, in a  |ternary_fission|Ternary_Fission| . The smallest of these fragments in ternary processes ranges in size from a proton to an  |argon|Argon|  nucleus.     Apart from fission induced by a neutron, harnessed and exploited by humans, a natural form of spontaneous  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay|  is also referred to as fission, and occurs especially in very high-mass-number isotopes.  |Spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission|  was discovered in 1940 by  |Flyorov|Georgy_Flyorov| ,  |Petrzhak|Konstantin_Petrzhak| , and  |Kurchatov|Igor_Kurchatov|  in Moscow, when they confirmed that, without bombardment by neutrons, the fission rate of uranium was indeed negligible, as predicted by  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr| ; it was not.      The unpredictable composition of the products distinguishes fission from purely  |quantum_tunneling|Quantum_Tunneling|  processes such as  |proton_emission|Proton_Emission| ,  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay| , and  |cluster_decay|Cluster_Decay| , which give the same products each time. Nuclear fission produces energy for  |nuclear_power|Nuclear_Power|  and drives the explosion of  |nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapon| . Both uses are possible because certain substances called  |nuclear_fuels|Nuclear_Fuel|  undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons, and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart. This makes a self-sustaining  |nuclear_chain_reaction|Nuclear_Chain_Reaction|  possible, releasing energy at a controlled rate in a  |nuclear_reactor|Nuclear_Reactor|  or at a very rapid, uncontrolled rate in a  |nuclear_weapon|Nuclear_Weapon| .     The amount of  |free_energy|Thermodynamic_Free_Energy|  contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as  |gasoline|Gasoline| , making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy. The products of nuclear fission, however, are on average far more  |radioactive|Radioactive|  than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel, and remain so for significant amounts of time, giving rise to a  |nuclear_waste|Radioactive_Waste|  problem. Concerns over  |nuclear_waste|Radioactive_Waste|  accumulation and over the  |destructive_potential|Nuclear_Winter|  of nuclear weapons are a counterbalance to the peaceful desire to use  |fission_as_an_energy_source|Nuclear_Power| .                     Nuclear fission can occur without  |neutron|Neutron|  bombardment as a type of  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| . This type of fission  is rare except in a few heavy isotopes.       In engineered nuclear devices, essentially all nuclear fission occurs as a  |nuclear_reaction|Nuclear_Reaction|  — a bombardment-driven process that results from the collision of two subatomic particles. In nuclear reactions, a subatomic particle collides with an atomic nucleus and causes changes to it. Nuclear reactions are thus driven by the mechanics of bombardment, not by the relatively constant  |exponential_decay|Exponential_Decay|  and  |half-life|Half-Life|  characteristic of spontaneous radioactive processes.     Many types of  |nuclear_reactions|Nuclear_Reactions|  are currently known. Nuclear fission differs importantly from other types of nuclear reactions, in that it can be amplified and sometimes controlled via a  |nuclear_chain_reaction|Nuclear_Chain_Reaction|  . In such a reaction, free  |neutrons|Neutrons|  released by each fission event can trigger yet more events, which in turn release more neutrons and cause more fission.     The  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element| |isotopes|Isotopes|  that can sustain a fission chain reaction are called  |nuclear_fuels|Nuclear_Fuel| , and are said to be  fissile . The most common nuclear fuels are  |235_U|Uranium-235|   and  |239_Pu|Plutonium-239|  . These fuels break apart into a bimodal range of chemical elements with atomic masses centering near 95 and 135  u . Most nuclear fuels undergo  |spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission|  only very slowly, decaying instead mainly via an  |alpha|Alpha_Particle| - |beta|Beta_Particle| |decay_chain|Decay_Chain|  over periods of  |millennia|Millennium|  to  |eons|Eon| . In a  |nuclear_reactor|Nuclear_Reactor|  or nuclear weapon, the overwhelming majority of fission events are induced by bombardment with another particle, a neutron, which is itself produced by prior fission events.     Nuclear fission in fissile fuels are the result of the nuclear excitation energy produced when a fissile nucleus captures a neutron. This energy, resulting from the neutron capture, is a result of the attractive  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force|  acting between the neutron and nucleus. It is enough to deform the nucleus into a double-lobed drop , to the point that nuclear fragments exceed the distances at which the nuclear force can hold two groups of charged nucleons together and, when this happens, the two fragments complete their separation and then are driven further apart by their mutually repulsive charges, in a process which becomes irreversible with greater and greater distance. A similar process occurs in  |fissionable|Fissionable|  isotopes , but in order to fission, these isotopes require additional energy provided by  |fast_neutrons|Fast_Neutron|  .     The  |liquid_drop_model|Liquid_Drop_Model|  of the  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  predicts equal-sized fission products as an outcome of nuclear deformation. The more sophisticated  |nuclear_shell_model|Nuclear_Shell_Model|  is needed to mechanistically explain the route to the more energetically favorable outcome, in which one fission product is slightly smaller than the other. A theory of the fission based on shell model has been formulated by  |Maria_Goeppert_Mayer|Maria_Goeppert_Mayer| .     The most common fission process is binary fission, and it produces the fission products noted above, at 95±15 and 135±15  u. However, the binary process happens merely because it is the most probable. In anywhere from 2 to 4 fissions per 1000 in a nuclear reactor, a process called  |ternary_fission|Ternary_Fission|  produces three positively charged fragments and the smallest of these may range from so small a charge and mass as a proton , to as large a fragment as  |argon|Argon|  . The most common small fragments, however, are composed of 90% helium-4 nuclei with more energy than alpha particles from alpha decay , plus helium-6 nuclei, and tritons . The ternary process is less common, but still ends up producing significant helium-4 and tritium gas buildup in the fuel rods of modern nuclear reactors. S. Vermote, et al.  in Dynamical aspects of nuclear fission: proceedings of the 6th International Conference. J. Kliman, M. G. Itkis, S. Gmuca . World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

The fission of a heavy nucleus requires a total input energy of about 7 to 8 million  |electron_volts|Electron_Volt|  to initially overcome the  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force|  which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape, and from there, deform it into a two-lobed shape in which the lobes are able to continue to separate from each other, pushed by their mutual positive charge, in the most common process of binary fission . Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a critical distance, beyond which the short range  |strong_force|Strong_Force|  can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the  |electromagnetic|Electromagnetic_Force|  repulsion between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.     About 6 MeV of the fission-input energy is supplied by the simple binding of an extra neutron to the heavy nucleus via the strong force; however, in many fissionable isotopes, this amount of energy is not enough for fission. Uranium-238, for example, has a near-zero fission cross section for neutrons of less than one MeV energy. If no additional energy is supplied by any other mechanism, the nucleus will not fission, but will merely absorb the neutron, as happens when U-238 absorbs slow and even some fraction of fast neutrons, to become U-239. The remaining energy to initiate fission can be supplied by two other mechanisms: one of these is more kinetic energy of the incoming neutron, which is increasingly able to fission a  |fissionable|Fissionable|  heavy nucleus as it exceeds a kinetic energy of one MeV or more . Such high energy neutrons are able to fission U-238 directly . However, this process cannot happen to a great extent in a nuclear reactor, as too small a fraction of the fission neutrons produced by any type of fission have enough energy to efficiently fission U-238 . J. Byrne Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter, Dover Publications, Mineola, NY, p. 259, .     Among the heavy  |actinide|Actinide|  elements, however, those isotopes that have an odd number of neutrons bind an extra neutron with an additional 1 to 2 MeV of energy over an isotope of the same element with an even number of neutrons . This extra binding energy is made available as a result of the mechanism of  |neutron_pairing|Semi-Empirical_Mass_Formula|  effects. This extra energy results from the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle|  allowing an extra neutron to occupy the same nuclear orbital as the last neutron in the nucleus, so that the two form a pair. In such isotopes, therefore, no neutron kinetic energy is needed, for all the necessary energy is supplied by absorption of any neutron, either of the slow or fast variety . As noted above, the subgroup of fissionable elements that may be fissioned efficiently with their own fission neutrons  are termed  |fissile|Fissile| . Examples of fissile isotopes are uranium-235 and plutonium-239.       Typical fission events release about two hundred million  |eV|Electronvolt|  of energy, the equivalent of roughly  ref nameENS  /ref  ref name bulletin1950  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  |ef_/ref_ref_/ref_ref_/ref_ref_/re|Ef_/Ref_Ref_/Ref_Ref_/Ref_Ref_/Re|  !-- The number is correct as destructive power increases as yield raised to the 2/3 power--  ref  /ref  sup /sup sup /sup  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  blockquote  /blockquote blockquote  sup /sup ref  /ref /blockquote  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  sup /sup ref  /ref  sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup .
