   Embryo drawing is the  |illustration|Illustration|  of  |embryos|Embryo|  in their  |developmental_sequence|Embryogenesis| . In plants and animals, an embryo develops from a  |zygote|Zygote| , the single cell that results when an  |egg|Egg|  and  |sperm|Sperm|  fuse during  |fertilization|Fertilization| . In animals, the zygote divides repeatedly to form a ball of cells, which then forms a set of tissue layers that migrate and fold to form an early embryo. Images of embryos provide a means of comparing embryos of different ages, and  |species|Species| . To this day, embryo drawings are made in  |undergraduate|Undergraduate| |_developmental_biology|Developmental_Biology|  lessons.     Comparing different embryonic stages of different animals is a tool that can be used to infer relationships between species, and thus  |biological_evolution|Biological_Evolution| . This has been a source of quite some controversy, both now and in the past.  |Ernst_Haeckel|Ernst_Haeckel|  pioneered in this field. By comparing different embryonic stages of different  |vertebrate|Vertebrate|  species, he formulated the  |recapitulation_theory|Recapitulation_Theory| . This  |theory|Theory|  states that an animals embryonic development follows exactly the same sequence as the sequence of its evolutionary ancestors. Haeckels work and the ensuing controversy linked the fields of  |developmental_biology|Developmental_Biology|  and  |comparative_anatomy|Comparative_Anatomy|  into comparative  |embryology|Embryology| . From a more modern perspective, Haeckels drawings were the beginnings of the field of  |evolutionary_developmental_biology|Evolutionary_Developmental_Biology|  .     The study of comparative embryology aims to prove or disprove that vertebrate embryos of different  |classes|Class|  follow a similar developmental path due to their common ancestry. Such developing vertebrates have similar  |genes|Gene| , which determine the basic body plan. However, further development allows for the distinguishing of distinct characteristics as adults.          In current biology, fundamental research in developmental biology and evolutionary developmental biology is no longer driven by  |morphological|Morphology|  comparisons between embryos, but more by  |molecular_biology|Molecular_Biology| . This is partly because Haeckels drawings were very inaccurate.       The exactness of  |Ernst_Haeckels|Ernst_Haeckel|  drawings of embryos has caused much controversy among  |Intelligent_Design|Intelligent_Design|  proponents recently and Haeckels intellectual opponents in the past. Although the early embryos of different species exhibit similarities, Haeckel greatly exaggerated these similarities in support of his  |Recapitulation_theory|Recapitulation_Theory| , sometimes known as the  |Biogenetic_Law|Biogenetic_Law|  or  |Ontogeny|Ontogeny|  recapitulates  |phylogeny|Phylogenetics|  . Furthermore, Haeckel even proposed theoretical life-forms to accommodate certain stages in embryogenesis. A recent review concluded that the biogenetic law is supported by several recent studies - if applied to single characters only . Michael K. Richardson and Gerhard Keuck, Haeckels ABC of evolution and development , Biol. Rev. 77, 495-528     Critics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,  |Karl_von_Baer|Karl_Von_Baer|  and  |Wilhelm_His|Wilhelm_His_Sr_| , did not believe that living embryos reproduce the evolutionary process and produced embryo drawings of their own  which emphasized the differences in early embryological development. Late 20th and early 21st century critic  |Stephen_Jay_Gould|Stephen_Jay_Gould|  Gould, Stephen Jay. Abscheulich! : Haeckels distortions did not help Darwin . Nat. Hist. 109 : 42-49. has objected to the continued use of Haeckels embryo drawings in textbooks.     On the other hand, Michael K. Richardson, Professor of Evolutionary Developmental Zoology,  |Leiden_University|Leiden_University| , while recognizing that some criticisms of the drawings are legitimate , has supported the drawings as teaching aids, Haeckels much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution. While some criticisms of the drawings are legitimate, others are more tenditious. , M. K. Richardson and G. Keuck, Haeckels ABC of evolution and development , Biol. Rev. 77, 495-528 and has said that on a fundamental level, Haeckel was correct Letter to Science, 280, , 983-984.              Haeckels illustrations show vertebrate embryos at different stages of development, which exhibit embryonic resemblance as support for evolution, recapitulation as evidence of the Biogenetic Law, and phenotypic divergence as evidence of  |von_Baers_laws|Karl_Ernst_Von_Baerbaers_Laws| . The series of twenty-four embryos from the early editions of Haeckels Anthropogenie remain the most famous. The different species are arranged in columns, and the different stages in rows. Similarities can be seen along the first two rows; the appearance of specialized characters in each species can be seen in the columns and a diagonal interpretation leads one to Haeckels idea of recapitulation.     Haeckels embryo drawings are primarily intended to express his theory of embryonic development, the Biogenetic Law, which in turn assumes the evolutionary concept of  |common_descent|Common_Descent| . His postulation of embryonic development coincides with his understanding of evolution as a developmental process. Nyhart, Biology Takes Form, pp. 132-133 In and around 1800, embryology fused with comparative anatomy as the primary foundation of  |morphology|Morphology| . Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 264 Ernst Haeckel, along with Karl von Baer and Wilhelm His, are primarily influential in forming the preliminary foundations of ‘phylogenetic embryology’ based on principles of evolution. Richardson and Keuck, Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development, p. 497 Haeckels ‘Biogenetic Law’ portrays the parallel relationship between an embryos development and phylogenetic history. The term, ‘recapitulation,’ has come to embody Haeckels Biogenetic Law, for embryonic development is a recapitulation of evolution. Nyhart, Biology Takes Form, p. 9 Haeckel proposes that all classes of vertebrates pass through an evolutionarily conserved “ |phylotypic|Phylotype| ” stage of development, a period of reduced phenotypic diversity among higher embryos. Richardson and Keuck, Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development, p. 506 Only in later development do particular differences appear. Haeckel portrays a concrete demonstration of his Biogenetic Law through his  Gastrea  theory, in which he argues that the early cup-shaped  |gastrula|Gastrula|  stage of development is a universal feature of multi-celled animals. An ancestral form existed, known as the gastrea, which was a common ancestor to the corresponding gastrula. Nyhart, Biology Takes Form, p. 159     Haeckel argues that certain features in embryonic development are conserved and  |palingenetic|Palingenesis| , while others are  |caenogenetic|Caenogenesis| . Caenogenesis represents “the blurring of ancestral resemblances in development,” which are said to be the result of certain adaptations to embryonic life due to environmental changes. Richardson and Keuck, Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development, p. 499 In his drawings, Haeckel cites the  |notochord|Notochord| ,  |pharyngeal_arches|Branchial_Arch|  and clefts,  |pronephros|Pronephros|  and  |neural_tube|Neural_Tube|  as palingenetic features. However, the  |yolk_sac|Yolk_Sac| , extra-embryonic membranes, egg membranes and  |endocardial|Endocardium|  tube are considered caenogenetic features. Richardson and Keuck, Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development, p. 500 The addition of terminal adult stages and the telescoping, or driving back, of such stages to descendants embryonic stages are likewise representative of Haeckelian embryonic development. In addressing his embryo drawings to a general audience, Haeckel does not cite any sources, which gives his opponents the freedom to make assumptions regarding the originality of his work. Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 270       Haeckel was not the only one to create a series of drawings representing embryonic development.  |Karl_E_von_Baer|Karl_Ernst_Von_Baer|  and Haeckel both struggled to model one of the most complex problems facing embryologists at the time: the arrangement of general and special characters during development in different species of animals. In relation to developmental timing, von Baers scheme of development differs from Haeckels scheme. Von Baers scheme of development need not be tied to developmental stages defined by particular characters, where recapitulation involves  |heterochrony|Heterochrony| . Heterochrony represents a gradual alteration in the original phylogenetic sequence due to embryonic adaptation. Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, Haeckels ABC of Evolution and Development, p. 506   As well, von Baer early noted that embryos of different species could not be easily distinguished from one another as in adults.      |Von_Baers_laws|Karl_Ernst_Von_Baerbaers_Laws|  governing embryonic development are specific rejections of recapitulation. As a response to Haeckels theory of recapitulation, von Baer enunciates his most notorious laws of development. Von Baers laws state that general features of animals appear earlier in the embryo than special features, where less general features stem from the most general, each embryo of a species departs more and more from a predetermined passage through the stages of other animals, and there is never a complete morphological similarity between an embryo and a lower adult. Gould, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, p. 56 Von Baers embryo drawings   display that individual development proceeds from general features of the developing embryo in early stages through differentiation into special features specific to the species, establishing that linear evolution could not occur. Richards, The Meaning of Evolution, p. 57-59 Embryological development, in von Baers mind, is a process of differentiation, a movement from the more  |homogeneous|Wikt_Homogeneous|  and universal to the more  |heterogeneous|Heterogeneous|  and individual. Richards, The Meaning of Evolution, p. 59-60     Von Baer argues that embryos will resemble each other before attaining characteristics differentiating them as part of a specific  |family|Family| ,  |genus|Genus|  or  |species|Species| , but embryos are not the same as the final forms of lower organisms.       Wilhelm His was one of Haeckels most authoritative and primary opponents advocating physiological embryology. Gould, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, p. 189 His Anatomie menschlicher Embryonen employs a series of his most important drawings chronicling developing embryos from the end of the second week through the end of the second month of pregnancy. His, in opposition to Haeckel, seeks to take human embryos out of the hands of Darwinist proponents. In 1878, His begins to engage in serious study of the anatomy of human embryos for his drawings. During the 19th century, embryologists often obtained early human embryos from abortions and miscarriages, postmortems of pregnant women and collections in anatomical museums. Hopwood, Producing Development , p. 38 In order to construct his series of drawings, His collected specimens which he manipulated into a form that he could operate with.     In His’ Normentafel, he displays specific individual embryos rather than ideal types. Hopwood, Producing Development , p. 36 His does not produce norms from aborted specimens, but rather visualizes the embryos in order to make them comparable and specifically subjects his embryo specimens to criticism and comparison with other cases. Ultimately, His’ critical work in embryonic development comes with his production of a series of embryo drawings of increasing length and degree of development. Hopwood, Producing Development , p. 50 His’ depiction of embryological development strongly differs from Haeckels depiction, for His argues that the phylogenetic explanation of ontogenetic events is unnecessary. His argues that all ontogenetic events are the “mechanical” result of differential cell growth. Di Gregorio, From Here to Eternity, p. 277 His’ embryology is not explained in terms of ancestral history.     The debate between Haeckel and His ultimately becomes fueled by the description of an embryo that  |Wilhelm_Krause|Wilhelm_Krause|  propels directly into the ongoing feud between Haeckel and His. Haeckel speculates that the  |allantois|Allantois|  is formed in a similar way in both humans and other mammals. His, on the other hand, accuses Haeckel of altering and playing with the facts. Although Haeckel is proven right about the allantois, the utilization of Krauses embryo as justification turns out to be problematic, for the embryo is that of a bird rather than a human. The underlying debate between Haeckel and His derives from differing viewpoints regarding the similarity or dissimilarity of vertebrate embryos. In response to Haeckels evolutionary claim that all vertebrates are essentially identical in the first month of embryonic life as proof of common descent, His responds by insisting that a more skilled observer would recognize even sooner that early embryos can be distinguished. His also counteracts Haeckels sequence of drawings in the Anthropogenie with what he refers to as “exact” drawings, highlighting specific differences. Ultimately, His goes so far as to accuse Haeckel of “faking” his embryo illustrations to make the vertebrate embryos appear more similar than in reality. His also accuses Haeckel of creating early human embryos that he conjured in his imagination rather than obtained through  |empirical|Empirical|  observation. His completes his denunciation of Haeckel by pronouncing that Haeckel had “‘relinquished the right to count as an equal in the company of serious researchers.’” Hopwood, Producing Development , p. 61       Haeckel encountered numerous oppositions to his artistic depictions of embryonic development during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Haeckel’s opponents believe that he de-emphasizes the differences between early embryonic stages in order to make the similarities between embryos of different species more pronounced. Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 282       The first suggestion of fakery against Haeckel was made in late 1868 by Ludwig Rutimeyer in the Archiv für Anthropogenie. Rutimeyer was a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the  |University_of_Basel|University_Of_Basel| , who rejected natural selection as simply mechanistic and proposed an anti-materialist view of nature. Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel “had taken to kinds of liberty with established truth.” Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 283 Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel presented the same image three consecutive times as the embryo of the dog, the chicken, and the turtle. Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 275      |Theodor_Bischoff|Theodor_Ludwig_Wilhelm_Bischoff|  , was a strong opponent of  |Darwinism|Darwinism| . As a pioneer in mammalian embryology, he was one of Haeckels strongest critics. Although Bischoffs 1840 surveys depict how similar the early embryos of man are to other vertebrates, he later demanded that such  |hasty_generalization|Hasty_Generalization|  was inconsistent with his recent findings regarding the dissimilarity between hamster embryos and those of rabbits and dogs. Nevertheless, Bischoffs main argument was in reference to Haeckels drawings of human embryos, for Haeckel is later accused of miscopying the dog embryo from him. Throughout Haeckels time, criticism of his embryo drawings was often due in part to his critics belief in his representations of embryological development as “crude schemata.” Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 273       Michael Richardson and his colleagues in a July 1997 issue of Anatomy and Embryology, Richardson, M.K., Hanken, J., Gooneratne, M.L., Pieau, C., Raynaud. A., Selwood, L. and Wright, G.M. : There is no highly conserved embryonic stage in the vertebrates: implications for current theories of evolution and development. Anatomy and Embryology 196: 91-106. demonstrated that Haeckel falsified his drawings in order to exaggerate the similarity of the phylotypic stage.   In a March 2000 issue of  Natural History , Stephen Jay Gould argued that Haeckel exaggerated the similarities by idealizations and omissions. As well, Gould argued that Haeckels drawings are simply inaccurate and falsified.    On the other hand, one of those who criticized Haeckels drawings, Michael Richardson, has argued that Haeckels much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution . Richardson and Keuck, Haeckels ABC of evolution and development , Biol. Rev. 77, 495-528   But even Richardson admitted in  Science  Magazine in 1997 that his teams investigation of Haeckels drawings were showing them to be one of the most famous fakes in biology.      Some version of Haeckels drawings can be found in many modern biology textbooks in discussions of the history of embryology, with clarification that these are no longer considered valid . Futuyma, Douglas, Evolutionary Biology, p. 652-653       Although Charles Darwin accepted Haeckels support for natural selection, he was tentative in using Haeckels ideas in his writings; with regard to embryology, Darwin relied far more on von Baers work. Haeckels work was published in 1866 and 1874, years after Darwins The Origin of Species .     Despite the numerous oppositions, Haeckel has influenced many disciplines in science in his drive to integrate such disciplines of taxonomy and embryology into the Darwinian framework and to investigate phylogenetic reconstruction through his Biogenetic Law. As well, Haeckel served as a mentor to many important scientists, including  |Anton_Dohrn|Anton_Dohrn| ,  |Richard|Richard_Hertwig|  and  |Oscar_Hertwig|Oscar_Hertwig| ,  |Wilhelm_Roux|Wilhelm_Roux| , and  |Hans_Driesch|Hans_Driesch| . Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, Haeckels ABC of evolution and development, p. 496     One of Haeckels earliest proponents was  |Carl_Gegenbaur|Carl_Gegenbaur|  at the University of Jena , during which both men were absorbing the impact of Darwins theory. The two quickly sought to integrate their knowledge into an evolutionary program. In determining the relationships between phylogenetic linkages and evolutionary laws of form, both Gegenbaur and Haeckel relied on a method of comparison. Nyhart, Lynn K., Biology Takes Form, p. 150 As Gegenbaur argued, the task of comparative anatomy lies in explaining the form and organization of the animal body in order to provide evidence for the continuity and evolution of a series of organs in the body. Haeckel then provided a means of pursuing this aim with his biogenetic law, in which he proposed to compare an individuals various stages of development with its ancestral line. Although Haeckel stressed comparative embryology and Gegenbaur promoted the comparison of adult structures, both believed that the two methods could work in conjunction to produce the goal of evolutionary morphology. Nyhart, Lynn K., Biology Takes Form, p. 153     The philologist and anthropologist,  |Friedrich_Müller|Max_Müller| , used Haeckels concepts as a source for his ethnological research, involving the systematic comparison of the folklore, beliefs and practices of different societies. Müllers work relies specifically on theoretical assumptions that are very similar to Haeckels and reflects the German practice to maintain strong connections between empirical research and the philosophical framework of science. Language is particularly important, for it establishes a bridge between natural science and philosophy. Di Gregorio, Mario A., From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith, p. 253 For Haeckel, language specifically represented the concept that all phenomena of human development relate to the laws of biology. Di Gregorio, Mario A., From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith, p. 252 Although Müller did not specifically have an influence in advocating Haeckels embryo drawings, both shared a common understanding of development from lower to higher forms, for Müller specifically saw humans as the last link in an endless chain of evolutionary development. Di Gregorio, Mario A., From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith, p. 254     Modern acceptance of Haeckels Biogenetic Law, despite current rejection of Haeckelian views, finds support in the certain degree of parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny. A. M. Khazen, on the one hand, states that ontogeny is obliged to repeat the main stages of phylogeny. Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, Haeckels ABC of Evolution and Development, p. 501 A. S. Rautian, on the other hand, argues that the reproduction of ancestral patterns of development is a key aspect of certain biological systems. Dr. Rolf Siewing acknowledges the similarity of embryos in different species, along with the laws of von Baer, but does not believe that one should compare embryos with adult stages of development. According to M. S. Fischer, reconsideration of the Biogenetic Law is possible as a result of two fundamental innovations in biology since Haeckels time:  |cladistics|Cladistics|  and developmental genetics. Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, Haeckels ABC of Evolution and Development, p. 502     In defense of Haeckels embryo drawings, the principal argument is that of schematisation. Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, Haeckels ABC of Evolution and Development, p. 519 Haeckels drawings were not intended to be technical and scientific depictions, but rather schematic drawings and reconstructions for a specifically lay audience. Therefore, as R. Gursch argues, Haeckels embryo drawings should be regarded as reconstructions. Although his drawings are open to criticism, his drawings should not be considered falsifications of any sort. Although modern defense of Haeckels embryo drawings still considers the inaccuracy of his drawings, charges of fraud are considered unreasonable. As  |Erland_Nordenskiöld|Erland_Nordenskiöld|  argues, charges of fraud against Haeckel are unnecessary. R. Bender ultimately goes so far as to reject Hiss claims regarding the fabrication of certain stages of development in Haeckels drawings, arguing that Haeckels embryo drawings are faithful representations of real stages of embryonic development in comparison to published embryos. Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, Haeckels ABC of Evolution and Development, p. 520       Haeckels embryo drawings, as comparative plates, were at first only copied into biology textbooks, rather than texts on the study of embryology. Even though Haeckels program in comparative embryology virtually collapsed after the First World War, his embryo drawings have often been reproduced and redrawn with increased precision and accuracy in works that have kept the study of  |comparative_embryology|Comparative_Embryology|  alive. Nevertheless, neither His-inspired human embryology nor developmental biology are concerned with the comparison of vertebrate embryos. Although Stephen Jay Goulds 1977 book Ontogeny and Phylogeny .
