           Arsenic is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|   As and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|   33. Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with  |sulfur|Sulfur|  and  |metals|Metal| , but also as a pure elemental  |crystal|Crystal| . Arsenic is a  |metalloid|Metalloid| . It has various  |allotropes|Allotropy| , but only the gray form, which has a metallic appearance, is important to industry.     The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of  |lead|Lead|  . Arsenic is a common n-type  |dopant|Dopant|  in  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  electronic devices, and the  |optoelectronic|Optoelectronic|  compound  |gallium_arsenide|Gallium_Arsenide|  is the second most commonly used semiconductor after  |doped|Doping| |_silicon|Silicon| . Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of  |pesticides|Pesticide| , treated wood products,  |herbicides|Herbicide| , and  |insecticides|Insecticide| . These applications are declining due to the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds.       |A_few_species_of_bacteria|Bacteria|  are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory  |metabolites|Metabolite| . Trace quantities of arsenic are an essential  |dietary_element|Mineral|  in rats, hamsters, goats, chickens, and presumably other species. A role in human metabolism is not known. Anke M. Arsenic.

However,  |arsenic_poisoning|Arsenic_Poisoning|  occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed.  |Arsenic_contamination_of_groundwater|Arsenic_Contamination_Of_Groundwater|  is a problem that affects millions of people across the world.     The  |United_States|United_States| |_Environmental_Protection_Agency|Environmental_Protection_Agency|  states that all forms of arsenic are a serious risk to human health.  The United States  |Agency_for_Toxic_Substances_and_Disease_Registry|Agency_For_Toxic_Substances_And_Disease_Registry|  ranked arsenic as number 1 in its 2001 Priority List of  |Hazardous|Hazardous|  Substances at  |Superfund|Superfund|  sites.  Arsenic is classified as a Group-A  |carcinogen|Carcinogen| .                The three most common arsenic  |allotropes|Allotropy|  are gray, yellow, and black arsenic, with gray being the most common.  Gray arsenic  adopts a double-layered structure consisting of many interlocked, ruffled, six-membered rings. Because of weak bonding between the layers, gray arsenic is brittle and has a relatively low  |Mohs_hardness|Mohs_Hardness|  of 3.5. Nearest and next-nearest neighbors form a distorted octahedral complex, with the three atoms in the same double-layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next.  This relatively close packing leads to a high density of 5.73  g/cm 3 . Gray arsenic is a  |semimetal|Semimetal| , but becomes a  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  with a  |bandgap|Bandgap|  of 1.2–1.4  eV if amorphized.  Gray arsenic is also the most stable form.   Yellow arsenic is soft and waxy, and somewhat similar to  |tetraphosphorus|Tetraphosphorus|  .  Both have four atoms arranged in a  |tetrahedral|Tetrahedral|  structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by a single bond. This unstable allotrope, being molecular, is the most volatile, least dense, and most toxic. Solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor, . It is rapidly transformed into gray arsenic by light. The yellow form has a density of 1.97  g/cm 3 . Black arsenic is similar in structure to  |black_phosphorus|Black_Phosphorus| .   Black arsenic can also be formed by cooling vapor at around 100–220  °C. It is glassy and brittle. It is also a poor electrical conductor. . chemicool.com            Arsenic occurs in nature as a  |monoisotopic_element|Monoisotopic_Element| , composed of one stable  |isotope|Isotope| , 75 As.  As of 2003, at least 33  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  have also been synthesized, ranging in  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass|  from 60 to 92. The most stable of these is 73 As with a  |half_life|Half_Life|  of 80.30  days. All other isotopes have half-lives of under one day, with the exception of 71 As , 72 As , 74 As , 76 As , and 77 As . Isotopes that are lighter than the stable 75 As tend to decay by  |β_decay|Beta_Decay| , and those that are heavier tend to decay by  |β_−_decay|Beta_Decay| , with some exceptions.     At least 10  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 66 to 84. The most stable of arsenics isomers is 68m As with a half-life of 111  seconds.         Arsenic has a similar electronegativity and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and as such readily forms covalent molecules with most of the nonmetals. Though stable in dry air, arsenic forms a golden-bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes a black surface layer. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 552–4 When heated in air, arsenic  |oxidizes|Oxidation|  to  |arsenic_trioxide|Arsenic_Trioxide| ; the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling  |garlic|Garlic| . This odor can be detected on striking  |arsenide|Arsenide|  minerals such as  |arsenopyrite|Arsenopyrite|  with a hammer. It burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and  |arsenic_pentoxide|Arsenic_Pentoxide| , which have the same structure as the more well-known phosphorus compounds, and in fluorine to give  |arsenic_pentafluoride|Arsenic_Pentafluoride| . Arsenic  |sublimes|Sublimation|  upon heating at atmospheric pressure, converting directly to a gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at . The  |triple_point|Triple_Point|  is 3.63  MPa and . Arsenic makes  |arsenic_acid|Arsenic_Acid|  with concentrated  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| ,  |arsenous_acid|Arsenous_Acid|  with dilute nitric acid, and  |arsenic_trioxide|Arsenic_Trioxide|  with concentrated  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| ; however, it does not react with water, alkalis, or non-oxidising acids.  Arsenic reacts with metals to form  |arsenides|Arsenide| , though these are not ionic compounds containing the As 3− ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group 1 arsenides have properties of  |intermetallic|Intermetallic|  compounds. Like  |germanium|Germanium| ,  |selenium|Selenium| , and  |bromine|Bromine| , which like arsenic  |succeed_the_3d_transition_series|D_Block_Contraction| , arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of +5 than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony, and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers.            Compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of  |phosphorus|Phosphorus|  which occupies the same  |group|Group|  of the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| . The most common  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  for arsenic are: −3 in the  |arsenides|Arsenide| , which are alloy-like intermetallic compounds, +3 in the  |arsenites|Arsenite| , and +5 in the  |arsenates|Arsenates|  and most organoarsenic compounds. Arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square As ions in the mineral  |skutterudite|Skutterudite| .  In the +3  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State| , arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the  |lone_pair|Lone_Pair|  of  |electrons|Electron| .         One of the simplest arsenic compound is the trihydride, the highly toxic, flammable, pyrophoric  |arsine|Arsine|  . This compound is generally regarded as stable, since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly. At temperatures of 250–300  °C decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 557–8 Several factors, such as  |humidity|Humidity| , presence of light and certain  |catalysts|Catalyst|   facilitate the rate of decomposition.  It oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water, and analogous reactions take place with  |sulfur|Sulfur|  and  |selenium|Selenium|  instead of  |oxygen|Oxygen| .     Arsenic forms colorless, odorless, crystalline  |oxides|Oxide| |_As_2_O_3_|Arsenic_Trioxide|   and  |As_2_O_5_|Arsenic_Pentoxide|  which are  |hygroscopic|Hygroscopic|  and readily soluble in water to form acidic solutions.  |Arsenic_acid|Arsenic_Acid|  is a weak acid and the salts are called  |arsenates|Arsenate| , the most common  |arsenic_contamination_of_groundwater|Arsenic_Contamination_Of_Groundwater| , and a problem that affects many people. Synthetic arsenates include  |Scheeles_Green|Scheeles_Green|  ,  |calcium_arsenate|Calcium_Arsenate| , and  |lead_hydrogen_arsenate|Lead_Hydrogen_Arsenate| . These three have been used as  |agricultural|Agriculture| |insecticides|Insecticide|  and  |poisons|Poison| .     The protonation steps between the arsenate and arsenic acid are similar to those between  |phosphate|Phosphate|  and  |phosphoric_acid|Phosphoric_Acid| . Unlike  |phosphorous_acid|Phosphorous_Acid| ,  |arsenous_acid|Arsenous_Acid|  is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As 3 . Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 572–8     A broad variety of sulfur compounds of arsenic are known. Orpiment  and realgar  are somewhat abundant and were formerly used as painting pigments. In As 4 S 10 , arsenic has a formal oxidation state of +2 in As 4 S 4 which features As-As bonds so that the total covalency of As is still 3.  Both orpiment and realgar, as well as As 4 S 3 , have selenium analogs; the analogous As 2 Te 3 is known as the mineral  |kalgoorlieite|Kalgoorlieite| ,    and the anion As 2 Te − is known as a ligand in  |cobalt|Cobalt|  complexes. Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 578–83     All trihalides of arsenic are well known except the astatide, which is unknown.  |Arsenic_pentafluoride|Arsenic_Pentafluoride|  is the only important pentahalide, reflecting the lower stability of the +5 oxidation state; even so, it is a very strong fluorinating and oxidizing agent.          Arsenic is used as the group 5 element in the  |III_V_semiconductors|Iii_V_Semiconductor| |_gallium_arsenide|Gallium_Arsenide| ,  |indium_arsenide|Indium_Arsenide| , and  |aluminium_arsenide|Aluminium_Arsenide| .  The valence electron count of GaAs is the same as a pair of Si atoms, but the  |band_structure|Electronic_Band_Structure|  is completely different which results in distinct bulk properties.  Other arsenic alloys include the II-V semiconductor  |cadmium_arsenide|Cadmium_Arsenide| .                A large variety of organoarsenic compounds are known. Several were developed as  |chemical_warfare_agents|Chemical_Weapon|  during World War I, including  |vesicants|Blister_Agent|  such as  |lewisite|Lewisite|  and vomiting agents such as  |adamsite|Adamsite| .     |Cacodylic_acid|Cacodylic_Acid| , which is of historic and practical interest, arises from the  |methylation|Methylation|  of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry. Indeed,  |cacodyl|Cacodyl|  was the first organometallic compound known and was named from the Greek κακωδἰα stink for its offensive odor; it is very poisonous. Greenwood, p. 584                  Arsenic comprises about 1.5   |ppm|Parts_Per_Million|    of the  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust| , and is the 53rd most abundant element. Typical background concentrations of arsenic do not exceed 3  ng/m 3 in the atmosphere; 100  mg/kg in soil; and 10  μg/L in freshwater.      |Minerals|Mineral|  with the formula MAsS and MAs 2  are the dominant commercial sources of arsenic, together with  |realgar|Realgar|  and native arsenic. An illustrative mineral is  |arsenopyrite|Arsenopyrite|   , which is structurally related to  |iron_pyrite|Iron_Pyrite| . Many minor As-containing minerals are known. Arsenic also occurs in various organic forms in the environment.           In 2014, China was the top producer of white arsenic with almost 70% world share, followed by  |Morocco|Morocco| ,  |Russia|Russia| , and  |Belgium|Belgium| , according to the  |British_Geological_Survey|British_Geological_Survey|  and the  |United_States_Geological_Survey|United_States_Geological_Survey| . Most arsenic refinement operations in the US and Europe have closed over environmental concerns. Arsenic is found in the smelter dust from  |copper|Copper| ,  |gold|Gold| , and  |lead|Lead|  smelters, and is recovered primarily from copper refinement dust.     On  |roasting|Roasting|  arsenopyrite in air, arsenic sublimes as arsenic oxide leaving iron oxides, while roasting without air results in the production of gray arsenic. Further purification from sulfur and other chalcogens is achieved by  |sublimation|Sublimation|  in vacuum, in a hydrogen atmosphere, or by distillation from molten lead-arsenic mixture.                     The word arsenic has its origin in the  |Syriac|Syriac_Language|  word   zarniqa,  from the  |Persian|Persian_Language|  word  zarnikh, meaning yellow and hence  |orpiment|Orpiment|  . It was adopted into  |Greek|Greek_Language|  as arsenikon , a form that is  |folk_etymology|Folk_Etymology| , being the neuter form of the Greek word arsenikos , meaning male , virile . The Greek word was adopted in Latin as arsenicum, which in French became arsenic, from which the English word arsenic is taken. Arsenic sulfides  and oxides have been known and used since ancient times.   |Zosimos|Zosimos_Of_Panopolis|  describes roasting sandarach to obtain cloud of arsenic , which he then  |reduces|Redox|  to gray arsenic.  As the symptoms of  |arsenic_poisoning|Arsenic_Poisoning|  are not very specific, it was frequently used for  |murder|Murder|  until the advent of the  |Marsh_test|Marsh_Test| , a sensitive chemical test for its presence.  Owing to its use by the ruling class to murder one another and its potency and discreetness, arsenic has been called the poison of kings and the king of poisons .           During the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| , arsenic was often included in  |bronze|Bronze| , which made the alloy harder .     The isolation of arsenic was described by  |Jabir_ibn_Hayyan|Jabir_Ibn_Hayyan|  before 815 AD.  |George_Sarton|George_Sarton| , Introduction to the History of Science. We find in his writings preparation of various substances .  |Albertus_Magnus|Albertus_Magnus|  later isolated the element from a compound in 1250, by heating soap together with  |arsenic_trisulfide|Arsenic_Trisulfide| .  In 1649,  |Johann_Schröder|Johann_Schröder|  published two ways of preparing arsenic.  Crystals of elemental arsenic are found in nature, although rare.      |Cadets_fuming_liquid|Cadets_Fuming_Liquid|  , often claimed as the first synthetic  |organometallic_compound|Organometallic_Chemistry| , was synthesized in 1760 by  |Louis_Claude_Cadet_de_Gassicourt|Louis_Claude_Cadet_De_Gassicourt|  by the reaction of  |potassium_acetate|Potassium_Acetate|  with  |arsenic_trioxide|Arsenic_Trioxide| .           In the  |Victorian_era|Victorian_Era| , arsenic was mixed with  |vinegar|Vinegar|  and  |chalk|Chalk|  and eaten by women to improve the  |complexion|Complexion|  of their faces, making their skin paler to show they did not work in the fields.  Arsenic was also rubbed into the faces and arms of women to improve their complexion . The accidental use of arsenic in the adulteration of foodstuffs led to the  |Bradford_sweet_poisoning|1858_Bradford_Sweets_Poisoning|  in 1858, which resulted in around 20 deaths.  Wallpaper production also began to use dyes made from arsenic, which was thought to increase the pigments brightness.      Two arsenic pigments have been widely used since their discovery –  |Paris_Green|Paris_Green|  and  |Scheeles_Green|Scheeles_Green| . After the toxicity of arsenic became widely known, these chemicals were used less often as pigments and more often as insecticides. In the 1860s, an arsenic byproduct of dye production, London Purple was widely used. This was a solid mixture of arsenic trioxide, aniline, lime, and ferrous oxide, insoluble in water and very toxic by inhalation or ingestion , Chemical Book But it was later replaced with Paris Green, another arsenic-based dye.  With better understanding of the toxicology mechanism, two other compounds were used starting in the 1890s.   |Arsenite_of_lime|Calcium_Arsenate|  and  |arsenate_of_lead|Arsenate_Of_Lead|  were used widely as insecticides until the discovery of  |DDT|Ddt|  in 1942.                   The toxicity of arsenic to  |insects|Insect| ,  |bacteria|Bacteria| , and  |fungi|Fungi|  led to its use as a wood preservative.  In the 1930s, a process of treating wood with  |chromated_copper_arsenate|Chromated_Copper_Arsenate|   was invented, and for decades, this treatment was the most extensive industrial use of arsenic. An increased appreciation of the toxicity of arsenic led to a ban of CCA in consumer products in 2004, initiated by the  |European_Union|European_Union|  and United States.   However, CCA remains in heavy use in other countries .     Arsenic was also used in various agricultural insecticides and poisons. For example,  |lead_hydrogen_arsenate|Lead_Hydrogen_Arsenate|  was a common insecticide on  |fruit_trees|Fruit_Tree| ,  but contact with the compound sometimes resulted in  |brain_damage|Brain_Damage|  among those working the sprayers. In the second half of the 20th century,  |monosodium_methyl_arsenate|Monosodium_Methyl_Arsenate|  and  |disodium_methyl_arsenate|Disodium_Methyl_Arsenate|  – less toxic organic forms of arsenic – replaced lead arsenate in agriculture. These organic arsenicals were in turn phased out by 2013 in all agricultural activities except cotton farming.      The biogeochemistry of arsenic is complex and includes various adsorption and desorption processes. The toxicity of arsenic is connected to its solubility and is affected by pH. Arsenite  is more soluble than arsenate  and is more toxic; however, at a lower pH, arsenate becomes more mobile and toxic. It was found that addition of sulfur, phosphorus, and iron oxides to high-arsenite soils greatly reduces arsenic phytotoxicity.      Arsenic is used as a feed additive in  |poultry|Poultry_Farming|  and  |swine_production|Pig_Farming| , in particular in the U.S. to increase weight gain, improve  |feed_efficiency|Feed_Conversion_Ratio| , and to prevent disease.   An example is  |roxarsone|Roxarsone| , which had been used as a  |broiler|Broiler|  starter by about 70% of U.S. broiler growers.  The Poison-Free Poultry Act of 2009 proposed to ban the use of roxarsone in industrial swine and poultry production.  Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., which produces roxarsone, voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic, a carcinogen, in treated chickens.  A successor to Alpharma,  |Zoetis|Zoetis| , continues to sell  |nitarsone|Nitarsone| , primarily for use in turkeys.     Arsenic is intentionally added to the feed of  |chickens|Chickens|  raised for human consumption. Organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than pure arsenic, and promote the growth of chickens. Under some conditions, the arsenic in  |chicken_feed|Chicken_Feed|  is converted to the toxic inorganic form.      A 2006 study of the remains of the  |Australia|Australia| n racehorse,  |Phar_Lap|Phar_Lap| , determined that the 1932 death of the famous champion was caused by a massive overdose of arsenic. Sydney veterinarian Percy Sykes stated, In those days, arsenic was quite a common tonic, usually given in the form of a solution ... It was so common that Id reckon 90 per cent of the horses had arsenic in their system.          During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds were used as medicines, including  |arsphenamine|Arsphenamine|   and  |arsenic_trioxide|Arsenic_Trioxide|  .  Arsphenamine, as well as  |neosalvarsan|Neosalvarsan| , was indicated for  |syphilis|Syphilis| , but has been superseded by modern  |antibiotics|Antibiotics| . However, arsenicals such as  |melarsoprol|Melarsoprol|  are still used for the treatment of  |trypanosomiasis|Trypanosomiasis| , since although these drugs suffer from severe toxicity, the disease is almost uniformly fatal if untreated.      Arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 500 years, most commonly in the treatment of  |cancer|Cancer| , but also in medications as diverse as  |Fowlers_solution|Fowlers_Solution|  in  |psoriasis|Psoriasis| .  The US  |Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  in the year 2000 approved this compound for the treatment of patients with  |acute_promyelocytic_leukemia|Acute_Promyelocytic_Leukemia|  that is resistant to  |all_trans_retinoic_acid|All_Trans_Retinoic_Acid| .      Recently, researchers have been locating tumors using arsenic-74 . This isotope produces clearer  |PET_scan|Positron_Emission_Tomography|  images than the previous radioactive agent,  |iodine|Iodine| -124, because the body tends to transport iodine to the thyroid gland producing signal noise.      In subtoxic doses, soluble arsenic compounds act as  |stimulants|Stimulant| , and were once popular in small doses as medicine by people in the mid-18th to 19th centuries.          The main use of arsenic is in alloying with lead. Lead components in  |car_batteries|Automotive_Battery|  are strengthened by the presence of a very small percentage of arsenic.   |Dezincification|Selective_Leaching|  of brass is greatly reduced by the addition of arsenic.  Phosphorus Deoxidized Arsenical Copper with an arsenic content of 0.3% has an increased corrosion stability in certain environments.   |Gallium_arsenide|Gallium_Arsenide|  is an important  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  material, used in  |integrated_circuits|Integrated_Circuit| . Circuits made from GaAs are much faster than those made from  |silicon|Silicon| . Unlike silicon, GaAs has a  |direct_bandgap|Direct_Bandgap| , and can be used in  |laser_diodes|Laser_Diode|  and  |LEDs|Led|  to convert  |electrical|Electricity|  energy directly into  |light|Light| .         After  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the United States built a stockpile of 20,000 tons of  |weaponized|Chemical_Warfare| |_lewisite|Lewisite|  , an  |organoarsenic|Organoarsenic| |_vesicant|Vesicant|  and  |lung|Lung|  irritant. The stockpile was neutralized with bleach and dumped into the  |Gulf_of_Mexico|Gulf_Of_Mexico|  in the 1950s.  During the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| , the United States used  |Agent_Blue|Agent_Blue| , a mixture of  |sodium_cacodylate|Sodium_Cacodylate|  and its acid form, as one of the  |rainbow_herbicides|Rainbow_Herbicides|  to deprive North Vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice.          Copper acetoarsenite was used as a green  |pigment|Pigment|  known under many names, including  |Paris_Green|Paris_Green|  and Emerald Green. It caused numerous  |arsenic_poisonings|Arsenic_Poisoning| .  |Scheeles_Green|Scheeles_Green| , a copper arsenate, was used in the 19th century as a  |coloring_agent|Food_Dye|  in  |sweets|Sweets| .    Arsenic is used in  |bronzing|Bronzing|   and  |pyrotechnics|Pyrotechnics| .   As much as 2% of produced arsenic is used in lead alloys for  |lead_shot|Lead_Shot|  and  |bullets|Bullet| .    Arsenic is added in small quantities to alpha-brass to make it  |dezincification_resistant|Selective_Leaching| . This grade of brass is used in plumbing fittings and other wet environments.    Arsenic is also used for taxonomic sample preservation.    Until recently, arsenic was used in optical glass. Modern glass manufacturers, under pressure from environmentalists, have ceased using both arsenic and  |lead|Lead| .                    Some species of  |bacteria|Bacteria|  obtain their energy by  |oxidizing|Redox|  various fuels while  |reducing|Redox|  arsenate to arsenite. Under oxidative environmental conditions some bacteria oxidize arsenite to arsenate as fuel for their metabolism.  The  |enzymes|Enzyme|  involved are known as  |arsenate_reductases|Arsenate_Reductase|  .      In 2000, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis|  in the absence of oxygen with arsenites as  |electron_donors|Electron_Donor| , producing arsenates . This may be classified as chemolithoautotrophic arsenite oxidation, for which oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor, arsenite is the electron donor, and carbon dioxide is the carbon source.  Researchers conjecture that, over the course of history, these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. One  |strain|Strain|  PHS-1 has been isolated and is related to the  |gammaproteobacterium|Gammaproteobacterium|   Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovii . The mechanism is unknown, but an encoded Arr enzyme may function in reverse to its known  |homologues|Homology| .      In 2011, it was postulated that a strain of  Halomonadaceae  was able to grown in the absence of phosphorus by substituting it with arsenic.  Although the  |arsenate|Arsenate|  and  |phosphate|Phosphate|  anions are similar structurally, the study was widely criticised and subsequently refuted by independent researcher groups.           Some evidence indicates that arsenic is an essential trace mineral in birds , and in mammals . However, the  |biological_function|Biological_Function|  is not known. Anke M. Arsenic , pp. 347–372 in Mertz W. , Trace elements in human and Animal Nutrition, 5th ed. Orlando, FL: Academic Press  Uthus E.O. Arsenic essentiality and factors affecting its importance , pp. 199–208 in Chappell W.R, Abernathy C.O, Cothern C.R. Arsenic Exposure and Health. Northwood, UK: Science and Technology Letters.         Arsenic has been linked to  |epigenetic_changes|Epigenetics| , heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in  |DNA_sequence|Dna_Sequence| . These include DNA methylation, histone modification, and  |RNA|Rna|  interference. Toxic levels of arsenic cause significant DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes  |p16|P16|  and  |p53|P53| , thus increasing risk of  |carcinogenesis|Carcinogenesis| . These epigenetic events have been studied in vitro using human  |kidney|Kidney|  cells and in vivo using rat  |liver|Liver|  cells and peripheral blood  |leukocytes|Leukocytes|  in humans.   |Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry|Inductively_Coupled_Plasma_Mass_Spectrometry|  is used to detect precise levels of intracellular arsenic and other arsenic bases involved in epigenetic modification of DNA.  Studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor can be used to develop precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.     The Chinese brake fern  hyperaccumulates arsenic from the soil into its leaves and has a proposed use in  |phytoremediation|Phytoremediation| .            Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the  |food_chain|Food_Chain| , are progressively metabolized through a process of  |methylation|Methylation| .   For example, the mold  Scopulariopsis brevicaulis  produces significant amounts of  |trimethylarsine|Trimethylarsine|  if inorganic arsenic is present.  The organic compound  |arsenobetaine|Arsenobetaine|  is found in some marine foods such as fish and algae, and also in mushrooms in larger concentrations. The average persons intake is about 10–50  µg/day. Values about 1000  µg are not unusual following consumption of fish or mushrooms, but there is little danger in eating fish because this arsenic compound is nearly non-toxic.              Naturally occurring sources of human exposure include volcanic ash, weathering of minerals and ores, and mineralized groundwater. Arsenic is also found in food, water, soil, and air.  Arsenic is absorbed by all plants, but is more concentrated in leafy vegetables, rice, apple and grape juice, and seafood.  An additional route of exposure is inhalation of atmospheric gases and dusts. . The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry .   During the  |Victorian_era|Victorian_Era| , arsenic was widely used in home decor, especially wallpapers.             Extensive arsenic contamination of groundwater has led to widespread  |arsenic_poisoning|Arsenic_Poisoning|  in  |Bangladesh|Water_Supply_And_Sanitation_In_Bangladesh|   and neighboring countries.  It is estimated that approximately 57  million people in the Bengal basin are drinking  |groundwater|Groundwater|  with arsenic concentrations elevated above the  |World_Health_Organizations|World_Health_Organization|  standard of 10  |parts_per_billion|Concentration_Parts_Per_Notation|  .  However, a study of cancer rates in Taiwan  suggested that significant increases in cancer mortality appear only at levels above 150 ppb. The arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin, and is released from the sediment into the groundwater, caused by the  |anoxic_conditions|Dead_Zone|  of the subsurface. This groundwater was used after local and western  |NGOs|Non_Governmental_Organization|  and the Bangladeshi government undertook a massive shallow tube  |well|Water_Well|  drinking-water program in the late twentieth century. This program was designed to prevent drinking of bacteria-contaminated surface waters, but failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater. Many other countries and districts in  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia| , such as  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  and  |Cambodia|Cambodia| , have geological environments that produce groundwater with a high arsenic content.  |Arsenicosis|Arsenic_Poisoningarsenicosis_Chronic_Arsenic_Poisoning_From_Drinking_Water|  was reported in  |Nakhon_Si_Thammarat|Nakhon_Si_Thammarat| ,  |Thailand|Thailand|  in 1987, and the  |Chao_Phraya_River|Chao_Phraya_River|  probably contains high levels of naturally occurring dissolved arsenic without being a public health problem because much of the public uses bottled water.  In Pakistan, more than 60 million people are exposed to arsenic polluted drinking water indicated by a recent report of  |Science|Science| . Podgorskis team investigated more than 1200 samples and more than 66% samples exceeded the WHO minimum contamination level.      In the United States, arsenic is most commonly found in the ground waters of the southwest.  Parts of  |New_England|New_England| ,  |Michigan|Michigan| ,  |Wisconsin|Wisconsin| ,  |Minnesota|Minnesota|  and the Dakotas are also known to have significant concentrations of arsenic in ground water.  Increased levels of skin cancer have been associated with arsenic exposure in Wisconsin, even at levels below the 10 part per billion drinking water standard.  According to a recent film funded by the US  |Superfund|Superfund| , millions of private wells have unknown arsenic levels, and in some areas of the US, more than 20% of the wells may contain levels that exceed established limits.      Low-level exposure to arsenic at concentrations of 100 parts per billion compromises the initial immune response to  |H1N1_or_swine_flu|Influenza_A_Virus_Subtype_H1N1|  infection according to NIEHS-supported scientists. The study, conducted in laboratory mice, suggests that people exposed to arsenic in their drinking water may be at increased risk for more serious illness or death from the virus.      Some Canadians are drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic. Private-dug–well waters are most at risk for containing inorganic arsenic. Preliminary well water analysis typically does not test for arsenic. Researchers at the Geological Survey of Canada have modeled relative variation in natural arsenic hazard potential for the province of New Brunswick. This study has important implications for potable water and health concerns relating to inorganic arsenic.      Epidemiological evidence from  |Chile|Chile|  shows a dose-dependent connection between chronic arsenic exposure and various forms of cancer, in particular when other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, are present. These effects have been demonstrated at contaminations less than 50 ppb.  Arsenic is itself a constituent of  |tobacco_smoke|Tobacco_Smoke| .      Analyzing multiple epidemiological studies on inorganic arsenic exposure suggests a small but measurable increase in risk for bladder cancer at 10 ppb.  According to Peter Ravenscroft of the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge,  roughly 80 million people worldwide consume between 10 and 50 ppb arsenic in their drinking water. If they all consumed exactly 10 ppb arsenic in their drinking water, the previously cited multiple epidemiological study analysis would predict an additional 2,000 cases of bladder cancer alone. This represents a clear underestimate of the overall impact, since it does not include lung or skin cancer, and explicitly underestimates the exposure. Those exposed to levels of arsenic above the current WHO standard should weigh the costs and benefits of arsenic remediation.        Early evaluations of the processes for removing dissolved arsenic from drinking water demonstrated the efficacy of co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. In particular, iron as a coagulant was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding 90%.   Several adsorptive media systems have been approved for use at point-of-service in a study funded by the  |United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency|United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency|  and the  |National_Science_Foundation|National_Science_Foundation|  . A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in  |West_Bengal|West_Bengal|  based on in-situ remediation method . This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.      Another effective and inexpensive method to avoid arsenic contamination is to sink wells 500  feet or deeper to reach purer waters. A recent 2011 study funded by the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program shows that deep sediments can remove arsenic and take it out of circulation. In this process, called adsorption, arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles and is naturally removed from the ground water.      Magnetic separations of arsenic at very low magnetic field  |gradients|Gradient|  with high-surface-area and  |monodisperse|Monodisperse| |_magnetite|Magnetite| |nanocrystals|Nanocrystal|  have been demonstrated in point-of-use water purification. Using the high specific surface area of Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals, the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water has been dramatically reduced.      Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between chronic consumption of drinking water contaminated with arsenic and the incidence of all leading causes of mortality.  The literature indicates that arsenic exposure is causative in the pathogenesis of diabetes.      Chaff-based filters have recently been shown to reduce the arsenic content of water to 3  µg/L. This may find applications in areas where the potable water is extracted from underground  |aquifers|Aquifer| .   published by  |Magyar_Nemzet|Magyar_Nemzet|  on 15 April 2012.         For several centuries, the people of  |San_Pedro_de_Atacama|San_Pedro_De_Atacama|  in  |Chile|Chile|  have been drinking water that is contaminated with arsenic, and some evidence suggests they have developed some immunity.          Around one-third of the worlds population drinks water from groundwater resources. Of this, about 10 percent, approximately 300 million people, obtains water from groundwater resources that are contaminated with unhealthy levels of arsenic or fluoride.

Nature Geoscience, 1, 536–542 .          Arsenic is unique among the trace  |metalloids|Metalloids|  and oxyanion-forming trace metals . It is sensitive to mobilization at pH values typical of natural waters under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states , but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite or pentavalent arsenate Organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity, mostly in surface waters, but are rarely quantitatively important. Organic arsenic compounds may, however, occur where waters are significantly impacted by industrial pollution.      Arsenic may be solubilized by various processes. When pH is high, arsenic may be released from surface binding sites that lose their positive charge. When water level drops and  |sulfide|Sulfide|  minerals are exposed to air, arsenic trapped in sulfide minerals can be released into water. When organic carbon is present in water, bacteria are fed by directly reducing As to As or by reducing the element at the binding site, releasing inorganic arsenic. . Civil and Environmental Engineering.  |University_of_Maine|University_Of_Maine|      The aquatic transformations of arsenic are affected by pH, reduction-oxidation potential, organic matter concentration and the concentrations and forms of other elements, especially iron and manganese. The main factors are pH and the redox potential. Generally, the main forms of arsenic under oxic conditions are H 3 AsO 4 , H 2 AsO 4 − , HAsO 4 2− , and AsO 4 3− at pH 2, 2–7, 7–11 and 11, respectively. Under reducing conditions, H 3 AsO 4 is predominant at pH 2–9.     Oxidation and reduction affects the migration of arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the  |adsorption|Adsorption|  of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments. Zeng Zhaohua, Zhang Zhiliang . The formation of As element in groundwater and the controlling factor . Shanghai Geology 87 : 11–15.     The presence of sulfur is another factor that affects the transformation of arsenic in natural water. Arsenic can  |precipitate|Precipitate|  when metal sulfides form. In this way, arsenic is removed from the water and its mobility decreases. When oxygen is present, bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur to generate energy, potentially releasing bound arsenic.     Redox reactions involving Fe also appear to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems. The reduction of iron oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the release of arsenic to water. So arsenic can be enriched in water with elevated Fe concentrations.  Under oxidizing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized from  |pyrite|Pyrite|  or iron oxides especially at elevated pH. Under reducing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides. The reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances. One is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly. The other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the desorption of bound arsenic. Thomas, Mary Ann . . U.S. Geological Survey, Virginia. pp. 1–18.     Some species of bacteria catalyze redox transformations of arsenic. Dissimilatory arsenate-respiring prokaryotes speed up the reduction of As to As. DARP use As as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive. Other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process.  |Chemoautotrophic|Chemoautotrophic|  arsenite oxidizers and  |heterotrophic|Heterotrophic|  arsenite oxidizers convert As into As. CAO combine the oxidation of As with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate. They use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from CO 2 . HAO cannot obtain energy from As oxidation. This process may be an arsenic  |detoxification|Detoxification|  mechanism for the bacteria.      Equilibrium thermodynamic calculations predict that As concentrations should be greater than As concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions, i.e. where SO 4 2− reduction is occurring. However, abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow. Oxidation of As by dissolved O 2 is a particularly slow reaction. For example, Johnson and Pilson gave  |half_lives|Half_Life|  for the oxygenation of As in seawater ranging from several months to a year.  In other studies, As/As ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation, again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates. Cherry found from experimental studies that the As/As ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales.  Sterile water samples have been observed to be less susceptible to speciation changes than non-sterile samples.  Oremland found that the reduction of As to As in Mono Lake was rapidly catalyzed by bacteria with rate constants ranging from 0.02 to 0.3 day −1 .          As of 2002, US-based industries consumed 19,600 metric tons of arsenic. Ninety percent of this was used for treatment of wood with  |chromated_copper_arsenate|Chromated_Copper_Arsenate|  . In 2007, 50% of the 5,280 metric tons of consumption was still used for this purpose.   In the United States, the voluntary phasing-out of arsenic in production of consumer products and residential and general consumer construction products began on 31 December 2003, and alternative chemicals are now used, such as  |Alkaline_Copper_Quaternary|Alkaline_Copper_Quaternary| ,  |borates|Borate| ,  |copper_azole|Wood_Preservationcopper_Azole| ,  |cyproconazole|Cyproconazole| , and  |propiconazole|Propiconazole| .      Although discontinued, this application is also one of the most concerning to the general public. The vast majority of older  |pressure_treated|Timber_Treatment|  wood was treated with CCA. CCA lumber is still in widespread use in many countries, and was heavily used during the latter half of the 20th century as a structural and outdoor  |building_material|Building_Material| . Although the use of CCA lumber was banned in many areas after studies showed that arsenic could leach out of the wood into the surrounding  |soil|Soil|  , a risk is also presented by the burning of older CCA timber. The direct or indirect ingestion of wood ash from burnt CCA lumber has caused fatalities in animals and serious poisonings in humans; the lethal human dose is approximately 20  grams of ash.  Scrap CCA lumber from construction and demolition sites may be inadvertently used in commercial and domestic fires. Protocols for safe disposal of CCA lumber are not consistent throughout the world. Widespread  |landfill|Landfill|  disposal of such timber raises some concern,  but other studies have shown no arsenic contamination in the groundwater.           One tool that maps the location of arsenic releases in the United State is  |TOXMAP|Toxmap| .  TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System from the Division of Specialized Information Services of the  |United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine|United_States_National_Library_Of_Medicine|  funded by the US Federal Government. With marked-up maps of the United States, TOXMAP enables users to visually explore data from the  |United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agencys|United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency| |_Toxics_Release_Inventory|Toxics_Release_Inventory|  and  |Superfund_Basic_Research_Programs|Superfund_Basic_Research_Program| .

Retrieved 2011-10-24.  |PubMed|Pubmed| , and from other authoritative sources.         Physical, chemical, and biological methods have been used to remediate arsenic contaminated water.  Bioremediation is said to be cost-effective and environmentally friendly.  Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite is the dominant form in hypoxic to anoxic environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in anoxic conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor.  This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via  |phytoremediation|Phytoremediation|  but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.     Bioremediation requires careful evaluation and design in accordance with existing conditions. Some sites may require the addition of an electron acceptor while others require microbe supplementation . Regardless of the method used, only constant monitoring can prevent future contamination.             Arsenic and many of its compounds are especially potent poisons.         Elemental arsenic and arsenic sulfate and trioxide compounds are classified as  |toxic|Toxicity|  and dangerous for the environment in the  |European_Union|European_Union|  under  |directive_67_548_EEC|Directive_67_548_Eec| .     The  |International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer|International_Agency_For_Research_On_Cancer|  recognizes arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds as  |group_1_carcinogens|List_Of_Iarc_Group_1_Carcinogens| , and the EU lists arsenic trioxide,  |arsenic_pentoxide|Arsenic_Pentoxide| , and  |arsenate|Arsenate|  salts as category 1  |carcinogens|Carcinogen| .     Arsenic is known to cause  |arsenicosis|Arsenic_Poisoningarsenicosis_Chronic_Arsenic_Poisoning_From_Drinking_Water|  when present in drinking water, the most common species being arsenate ; As and arsenite .         In the United States since 2006, the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the  |Environmental_Protection_Agency|Environmental_Protection_Agency|  is 10 ppb . U.S.  |Environmental_Protection_Agency|Environmental_Protection_Agency| . Adopted 22 January 2001; effective 23 January 2006. and the FDA set the same standard in 2005 for bottled water.   The Department of Environmental Protection for New Jersey set a drinking water limit of 5 ppb in 2006.  The  |IDLH|Idlh|  value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is 5  mg/m 3 . The  |Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration|Occupational_Safety_And_Health_Administration|  has set the  |permissible_exposure_limit|Permissible_Exposure_Limit|  to a time-weighted average of 0.01  mg/m 3 , and the  |National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health|National_Institute_For_Occupational_Safety_And_Health|  has set the  |recommended_exposure_limit|Recommended_Exposure_Limit|  to a 15-minute constant exposure of 0.002  mg/m 3 .  The PEL for organic arsenic compounds is a TWA of 0.5  mg/m 3 .  .     In 2008, based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of American foods for toxic chemicals,  and  the U.S.  |Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  set the level of concern for inorganic arsenic in apple and pear juices at 23 ppb, based on non-carcinogenic effects, and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level; it also required recalls for non-conforming domestic products. In 2011, the national  Dr. Oz  television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers. Though the methodology was disputed the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb.  In response, FDA tested the worst brand from the Dr. Oz show and found much lower levels. Ongoing testing found 95% of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern. Later testing by  |Consumer_Reports|Consumer_Reports|  showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above 10 ppb, and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption.  In July 2013, on consideration of consumption by children, chronic exposure, and carcinogenic effect, the FDA established an action level of 10 ppb for apple juice, the same as the drinking water standard.     Concern about arsenic in rice in Bangladesh was raised in 2002, but at the time only Australia had a legal limit for food .   Concern was raised about people who were eating U.S. rice exceeding WHO standards for personal arsenic intake in 2005.  In 2011, the Peoples Republic of China set a food standard of 150 ppb for arsenic.      In the United States in 2012, testing by separate groups of researchers at the Childrens Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at  |Dartmouth_College|Dartmouth_College|   and  |Consumer_Reports|Consumer_Reports|    found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the FDA to set limits. . Foodsafetynews.com . Retrieved 2012-05-23. The FDA released some testing results in September 2012,   and as of July 2013, is still collecting data in support of a new potential regulation. It has not recommended any changes in consumer behavior.      Consumer Reports recommended:   That the EPA and FDA eliminate arsenic-containing fertilizer, drugs, and pesticides in food production;   That the FDA establish a legal limit for food;   That industry change production practices to lower arsenic levels, especially in food for children; and   That consumers test home water supplies, eat a varied diet, and cook rice with excess water, then draining it off .   Evidence-based public health advocates also recommend that, given the lack of regulation or labeling for arsenic in the U.S., children should eat no more than 1.5 servings per week of rice and should not drink rice milk as part of their daily diet before age 5.  They also offer recommendations for adults and infants on how to limit arsenic exposure from rice, drinking water, and fruit juice.   A 2014  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  advisory conference was scheduled to consider limits of 200–300 ppb for rice.                  Arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms, marine species in particular, but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs. In polluted areas, plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate, which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells. In polluted areas, uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion is likely in poorly-drained soils.                     Arsenics toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic oxides for  |thiols|Thiol| . Thiols, in the form of  |cysteine|Cysteine|  residues and  |cofactors|Cofactor|  such as  |lipoic_acid|Lipoic_Acid|  and  |coenzyme_A|Coenzyme_A| , are situated at the active sites of many important  |enzymes|Enzyme| .     Arsenic disrupts  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  production through several mechanisms. At the level of the  |citric_acid_cycle|Citric_Acid_Cycle| , arsenic inhibits  |lipoic_acid|Lipoic_Acid| , which is a cofactor for  |pyruvate_dehydrogenase|Pyruvate_Dehydrogenase| . By competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples  |oxidative_phosphorylation|Oxidative_Phosphorylation| , thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of  |NAD_|Nicotinamide_Adenine_Dinucleotide| , mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system  |organ_failure|Organ_Failure| . The organ failure is presumed to be from  |necrotic|Necrotic|  cell death, not  |apoptosis|Apoptosis| , since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur.             Occupational exposure and  |arsenic_poisoning|Arsenic_Poisoning|  may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry.      The conversion between As and As is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination. According to Croal, Gralnick, Malasarn and Newman, understanding what stimulates As oxidation and/or limits As reduction is relevant for  |bioremediation|Bioremediation|  of contaminated sites . The study of chemolithoautotrophic As oxidizers and the heterotrophic As reducers can help the understanding of the oxidation and/or reduction of arsenic.          Treatment of chronic arsenic poisoning is possible. British anti-lewisite  is prescribed in doses of 5  mg/kg up to 300  mg every 4  hours for the first day, then every 6  hours for the second day, and finally every 8  hours for 8 additional days.  However the USAs  |Agency_for_Toxic_Substances_and_Disease_Registry|Agency_For_Toxic_Substances_And_Disease_Registry|  states that the long-term effects of arsenic exposure cannot be predicted. Blood, urine, hair, and nails may be tested for arsenic; however, these tests cannot foresee possible health outcomes from the exposure. Long-term exposure and consequent excretion through urine has been linked to bladder and kidney cancer in addition to cancer of the liver, prostate, skin, lungs, and nasal cavity.
