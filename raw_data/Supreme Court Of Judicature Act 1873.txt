   The Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873  was an  |act|Act_Of_Parliament|  of the  |Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom|Parliament_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in 1873. It reorganised the  |English_court_system|English_Court_System|  to establish the  |High_Court|High_Court_Of_England_And_Wales|  and the  |Court_of_Appeal|Court_Of_Appeal_Of_England_And_Wales| , and also originally provided for the abolition of the  |judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords|Judicial_Functions_Of_The_House_Of_Lords|  with respect to  |England|England| . It would have retained those functions in relation to  |Scotland|Scotland|  and  |Ireland|Ireland|  for the time being. However, the  |Gladstone|William_Ewart_Gladstone| |Liberal|Liberal_Party|  government fell in 1874 before the act entered into force, and the succeeding  |Disraeli|Benjamin_Disraeli,_1St_Earl_Of_Beaconsfield| |Conservative|Conservative_Party|  government suspended the entry into force of the act by means of further acts passed in 1874 and 1875.       One of the reasons that the Liberal government under Gladstone wanted to abolish the judicial aspect of the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords|  was that it was concerned for the poor quality of  |judges|Judge|  at this court. Judges at the House of Lords secured their position by mere virtue of the fact that their fathers were  |hereditary_peers|Hereditary_Peer|  and so individuals would automatically inherit seats in the upper house rather than securing their position through merit. Therefore, some of the best  |lawyers|Lawyer|  in the land were prohibited from sitting as judges in the upper house simply because of their parentage.       However, under the Conservative government, the 1874 and 1875 Acts retained the judicial aspect of the House of Lords and ensured the quality of judicial appointments to the House of Lords by legislating under the  |Appellate_Jurisdiction_Act_1876|Appellate_Jurisdiction_Act_1876| , for the mechanism of  |law_lords|Lords_Of_Appeal_In_Ordinary| . The reigning monarch could appoint any individual to be a peer and thus a judge in the House of Lords. These judicial life peers would hold seats only for the duration of their life; their seat would not pass through their inheritance to their son. Thus,  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria|  and subsequent monarchs were able to appoint leading lawyers to adjudicate in the House of Lords by making them life peers.        |Lord_Cairns|Hugh_Cairns,_1St_Earl_Cairns| , Disraelis  |Lord_Chancellor|Lord_Chancellor| , sought to remove the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords|  jurisdiction for Scottish and Irish appeals as well, which would have completely removed its judicial jurisdiction. However, the Lord Chancellor could not muster the necessary support in the Parliament for the bill as originally proposed in 1874 or when it was reintroduced in 1875. Finally, when it became clear that the English legal profession was firmly opposed to the reform proposals, the  |Appellate_Jurisdiction_Act_1876|Appellate_Jurisdiction_Act_1876|  removed the provisions for the abolition of the judicial functions of the House of Lords, although it retained the provisions that established the  |High_Court|High_Court_Of_Justice|  and the  |Court_of_Appeal|Court_Of_Appeal_Of_England_And_Wales|.
