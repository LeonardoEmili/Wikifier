           At ,  |Cameroon|Cameroon|  is the worlds 53rd largest country. It is slightly larger than the nation of  |Sweden|Sweden|  and US state of California. It is comparable in size to  |Papua_New_Guinea|Papua_New_Guinea| . Cameroons landmass is , with  of water.     The country is located in Central and West Africa, bordering the  |Bight_of_Biafra|Bight_Of_Biafra| , between  |Equatorial_Guinea|Equatorial_Guinea|  and  |Nigeria|Nigeria| .     Cameroon is sometimes described as Africa in miniature because it exhibits all the major climates and vegetation of the continent: mountains, desert, rain forest, savanna grassland, and ocean coastland. Cameroon can be divided into five geographic zones. These are distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features.             Cameroons coastal plain extends  inland from the  |Gulf_of_Guinea|Gulf_Of_Guinea|  to the edge of a plateau. In the former western state, however, the mass of  |Mount_Cameroon|Mount_Cameroon|  reaches almost to the sea. The plain is densely forested including areas of  |Central_African_mangroves|Central_African_Mangroves|  especially around  |Douala|Douala|  and in the estuary of the  |Cross_River|Cross_River|  on the border with  |Nigeria|Nigeria| .     The low  |South_Cameroon_Plateau|South_Cameroon_Plateau| , rising from the coastal plain and dominated by tropical rain forest, has an average elevation of . It is less humid than the coast.     In western Cameroon is an irregular chain of mountains, hills, and plateaus that extends from Mount Cameroon almost to  |Lake_Chad|Lake_Chad|  at the northern tip of the country. This region includes the  |Bamenda|Bamenda_Highlands| ,  |Bamiléké|Bamiléké_Highlands| , and  |Mambilla_highlands|Mambilla_Highlands| . It also contains some of the countrys most fertile soils, notably around volcanic Mt. Cameroon. This area of tropical forest has been categorised by the  |World_Wildlife_Fund|World_Wildlife_Fund|  as the  |Cameroonian_Highlands_forests|Cameroonian_Highlands_Forests| |ecoregion|Ecoregion|  with  |Mount_Cameroon|Mount_Cameroon_And_Bioko_Montane_Forests|  considered separately because as an active volcano it has a distinct environment from the other mountains.     From the forested southern plateau the land rises northward to the grassy, rugged  |Adamaoua|Adamaoua_Highlands|  highlands. Stretching across Cameroon from the western mountain area, the Adamaoua forms a barrier between the north and south. Its average elevation is .     The southern  |savanna_plain|Savanna|  extends from the edge of the Adamaoua to Lake Chad. Its characteristic vegetation is scrub and grass. This is region of sparse rainfall and high median temperatures has been included as part of the  |East_Sudanian_savanna|East_Sudanian_Savanna|  ecoregion.              The climate varies with terrain, from tropical along the coast to semiarid and hot in the north.   Exceedingly hot and humid, the coastal belt includes some of the wettest places on earth. For example,  |Debundscha|Debundscha| , at the base of Mt. Cameroon, has an average annual rainfall of . .

The country has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers flow southwestward or westward directly to the  |Gulf_of_Guinea|Gulf_Of_Guinea|  – the  |Wouri|Wouri_River| , and lesser  |Dibamba|Dibamba_River| ,  |Bimbia|Bimbia_River|  and  |Mungo|Mungo_River,_Cameroon|  to the Cameroon  |estuary|Estuary|  near  |Douala|Douala| ;  |Sanaga|Sanaga_River| ,  |Nyong|Nyong_River| , and  |Ntem|Ntem_River|  further south along the coast;  |Akwayafe|Akwayafe_River|  and  |Manyu|Manyu_River|  , and the lesser  |Ndian|Ndian_River|  and  |Meme|Meme_River|  north of the coast.  The  |Dja|Dja_River|  and  |Kadeï|Kadei_River| , however, drain southeastward into the  |Congo_River|Congo_River| . In northern Cameroon, the  |Benoué_River|Benue_River|  runs north and west, eventually into the Niger, while the  |Logone_River|Logone_River|  flows northward into  |Lake_Chad|Lake_Chad| .       Some of the borders of Cameroon follow rivers, including the  |Aïna|Aïna_River| , Akwayafe, and Ntem or  |Campo|Campo_River| .
