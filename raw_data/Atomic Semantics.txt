Atomic semantics is a type of guarantee provided by a  |data_register|Data_Register|  shared by several  |processors|Central_Processing_Unit|  in a  |parallel_machine|Parallel_Machine|  or in a network of computers working together.   Atomic semantics are very strong. An atomic register provides strong guarantees even when there is concurrency and failures.     A read/write register R stores a value and is accessed by two basic operations: read and write. A read returns the value stored in R and write changes the value stored in R to v.   A register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties:     1opopopopopopopop1op2 .
