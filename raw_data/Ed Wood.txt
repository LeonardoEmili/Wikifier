              Edward Davis Wood Jr. was an American filmmaker, actor, and author.     In the 1950s, Wood directed several  |low-budget|B_Movie|  science fiction, crime and horror films, notably  Glen or Glenda  ,  Jail Bait  ,  Bride of the Monster  ,  Plan 9 from Outer Space  ,  Night of the Ghouls  and  The Sinister Urge  . In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards  |sexploitation|Sexploitation_Film|  and  |pornographic_films|Pornographic_Film| , and wrote over 80  |pulp|Pulp_Magazine|  crime, horror and sex novels. Notable for their  |campy|Camp|  aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated  |special_effects|Special_Effects| , ill-fitting  |stock_footage|Stock_Footage| , eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories, and non sequitur dialogue, Woods films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a  |Golden_Turkey_Award|The_Golden_Turkey_Awards|  for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.     Following the publication of  |Rudolph_Greys|Rudolph_Grey|  1992 oral biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr., a biopic of his life,  Ed Wood  , was directed by  |Tim_Burton|Tim_Burton| . Starring  |Johnny_Depp|Johnny_Depp|  as Wood, the film received two  |Academy_Awards|Academy_Awards| .       Woods father, Edward Sr., worked for the  |U.S._Postal_Service|United_States_Postal_Service|  as a custodian, and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in  |Poughkeepsie,_New_York|Poughkeepsie,_New_York| , where Ed Wood Jr. was born in 1924. According to Woods second wife, Kathy OHara, Woods mother Lillian would dress him in girls clothing when he was a child because she had always wanted a daughter. For the rest of his life, Wood  |crossdressed|Cross-Dressing| , infatuated with the feel of  |angora|Angora_Wool|  on his skin.     During his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and pulp fiction. He collected comics and  |pulp_magazines|Pulp_Magazine| , and adored movies, especially  |Westerns|Western| , serials, and anything involving the  |occult|Occult| .  |Buck_Jones|Buck_Jones|  and  |Bela_Lugosi|Bela_Lugosi|  were two of his earliest childhood idols. He often skipped school, in favor of watching motion pictures at the local movie theater, where  |stills|Film_Still|  from that days movie would often be thrown into the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage the images, and to add to his extensive collection.     On his 12th birthday, in 1936, Wood received as a gift his first movie camera, a  |Kodak|Eastman_Kodak|  Cine Special . One of his first pieces of footage, and one that imbued him with pride, showed the airship  Hindenburg  passing over the  |Hudson_River|Hudson_River|  at Poughkeepsie, shortly before its  |disastrous_crash|Hindenburg_Disaster|  at  |Lakehurst,_New_Jersey|Lakehurst,_New_Jersey| . One of Woods first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, and he also sang and played drums in a band. He later fronted a singing quartet called Eddie Woods Little Splinters , having learned to play a variety of string instruments.       In 1942, Wood enlisted in the  |United_States_Marine_Corps|United_States_Marine_Corps| , just months after the  |attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor| . Assigned to the 2nd  |Defense_Battalions|Marine_Defense_Battalions| , he reached the rank of corporal before he was discharged. Although Wood often claimed to have faced strenuous combat, including having his front teeth knocked out by a Japanese rifleman, his military records reveal this to be false; apart from recovering bodies on  |Betio|Betio|  following the  |Battle_of_Tarawa|Battle_Of_Tarawa| , and experiencing minor Japanese bombing raids on Betio and the  |Ellice_Islands|Ellice_Islands| , a recurring  |filariasis|Filariasis|  infection left him performing clerical work for the remainder of his enlistment, and his dental extractions were carried out over several months by Navy dentists, unconnected to any combat. Wood later claimed that he feared being wounded in battle more than he feared being killed, mainly because he was afraid a  |combat_medic|Combat_Medic|  would discover his secret due to wearing a bra and panties under his uniform during the Battle of Tarawa.              In 1947, Wood moved to Hollywood, California, where he wrote scripts and directed television pilots, commercials and several forgotten micro-budget westerns with names such as  Crossroads of Laredo  and Crossroad Avenger: The Legend of the Tucson Kid. In 1948, Wood wrote, produced, directed, and starred in Casual Company, a play derived from his unpublished novel, which was based on his service in the  |United_States_Marine_Corps|United_States_Marine_Corps| . It opened at the Village Playhouse to negative reviews on October 25.     In 1952, Wood was introduced to actor  |Bela_Lugosi|Bela_Lugosi|  by friend and fellow writer-producer  |Alex_Gordon|Alex_Gordon| , Woods roommate at the time, who was later involved in creating  |American_International_Pictures|American_International_Pictures| . Lugosis son,  |Bela_Lugosi_Jr.|Bela_G._Lugosi| , has been among those who felt Wood exploited the senior Lugosis stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not refuse any work,  while most documents and interviews with other Wood associates in Nightmare of Ecstasy suggest that Wood and Lugosi were genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of his  |clinical_depression|Major_Depressive_Disorder|  and  |addiction|Substance_Dependence| . Lugosi had become dependent on  |morphine|Morphine|  as a way of controlling his debilitating  |sciatica|Sciatica|  over the years, and was in a poor physical state.      Wood billed himself under a number of different pseudonyms, including Ann Gora  and Akdov Telmig .     Glen or Glenda Glen or Glenda   with producer  |George_Weiss|George_Weiss| . The film starred Wood , his girlfriend  |Dolores_Fuller|Dolores_Fuller| , and Lugosi as the god-like narrator.     Jail Bait Jail Bait  , along with co-writer Alex Gordon, which starred  |Lyle_Talbot|Lyle_Talbot|  and  |Steve_Reeves|Steve_Reeves|  . Bela Lugosi was supposed to play the lead role of the plastic surgeon, but was busy working on another film project when filming started and had to bow out.     Bride of the Monster Bride of the Monster  , based on an original story idea by Alex Gordon which he called The Atomic Monster.  It starred Bela Lugosi, Swedish wrestler  |Tor_Johnson|Tor_Johnson| , and  |Loretta_King|Loretta_King_Hadler| .     Plan 9 from Outer Space Plan 9 from Outer Space  , which featured Lugosi in a small role , Tor Johnson, Vampira ,  |Tom_Mason|Tom_Mason|  , and  |the_Amazing_Criswell|The_Amazing_Criswell|  as the films narrator. Plan 9 premiered  at a very small screening in 1957, was only released theatrically under the title Plan Nine from Outer Space in 1959, and was finally sold to  |late_night_television|Late_Night_Television_In_The_United_States|  in 1961, thereby finding its audience over the years.     It became Woods best-known film and received a  |cult_following|Cult_Following|  after 1980, when  |Michael_Medved|Michael_Medved|  declared this film  |the_worst_film_ever_made|List_Of_Films_Considered_The_Worst|  in his book  The Golden Turkey Awards .     The Violent Years The Violent Years   with director William M. Morgan, starring  Playboy  model  |Jean_Moorhead|Jean_Moorhead| .     Night of the Ghouls Night of the Ghouls  , starring Kenne Duncan, Tor Johnson , Criswell, Duke Moore, and Valda Hansen. The film may have been released marginally in March 1959, and then promptly vanished from sight for a quarter century. For many years, it was thought to be a  |lost_film|Lost_Film|  but it was rediscovered and finally released on home video in 1984.      The Sinister Urge The Sinister Urge  , Craig, Rob , The Sinister Urge , Ed Wood, Mad Genius: A Critical Study of the Films, McFarland & Company,  starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore, and Carl Anthony. Filmed in just five days, this is the last mainstream film Wood directed, although it has  |grindhouse|Grindhouse|  elements. The film contains an eerily prescient  scene, in which Carl Anthonys character states, I look at this slush, and I try to remember, at one time, I made good movies .     The scenes of teenagers at a pizza place had been shot in 1956 for Woods unfinished juvenile delinquency film Rock and Roll Hell      Orgy of the DeadShotgun Wedding and his 1965 transitional film  Orgy of the Dead  , combining the horror and grindhouse skin-flick genres. Wood handled various production details while  |Stephen_C._Apostolof|Stephen_C._Apostolof|  directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film begins with a recreation of the opening scene from the then-unreleased Night of the Ghouls. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosis old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul , preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave . The film also features a Wolf Man and a Mummy. Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted.  Venus Flytrap  aka The Revenge of Dr. X, a US/Japan  |horror_film|Horror_Film| , was based on an unproduced Ed Wood screenplay from the 1950s.     NecromaniaThe Photographer , the first of two films produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson, portraying a photographer using his position to engage in sexual antics with models. He had a smaller role in Robertsons second film, Mrs. Stones Thing, as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on lingerie in a bedroom.     In 1970, Wood made his own pornographic film,  Take It Out in Trade . The following year, he produced, wrote, and directed  Necromania   under the pseudonym Don Miller . The film was an early entry to the new subgenre of hardcore pornographic film. Thought lost for years, it resurfaced in edited form on Mike Vraneys  |Something_Weird|Something_Weird_Video|  imprint in the late 1980s, then was re-released on DVD by Fleshbot Films in 2005.     Throughout the 1970s, Wood worked with friend Stephen C. Apostolof, usually co-writing scripts, but also serving as an assistant director and associate producer.  His last known on-screen appearance was in Apostolofs Fugitive Girls  in 1974, where he played both a gas station attendant called Pops and a sheriff on the womens trail.       Beginning in the early 1960s up until his death, Wood wrote at least 80 lurid crime and sex novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines and daily newspapers. Thirty-two stories known to be written by Wood are collected in Blood Splatters Quickly, published by  |OR_Books|Or_Books|  in 2014. Novels include Black Lace Drag , Orgy of the Dead , Devil Girls , Death of a Transvestite , The Sexecutives , The Photographer ,  Take It Out in Trade  , The Only House in Town ,  Necromania  , The Undergraduate , A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies and Fugitive Girls .     In Nightmare of Ecstasy,  |Maila_Nurmi|Maila_Nurmi|  said she declined Woods offer to do a nude scene sitting in a coffin for the film version of his Necromania, claiming she was recovering from a major stroke at the time.     In 1965, Wood wrote the quasi- |memoir|Memoir|   Hollywood Rat Race , which was eventually published in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, youll get better , and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub  |cabaret|Cabaret| .           Wood had a long-term relationship with actress and songwriter  |Dolores_Fuller|Dolores_Fuller| , whom he met in late 1952. The two lived together for a time and Wood cast Fuller in three of his films: Glen or Glenda, Jail Bait, and Bride of the Monster. Fuller later said she initially had no idea that Wood was a  |crossdresser|Crossdresser|  and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman in Glen or Glenda. The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress in the lead role of Bride of the Monster and because of Woods excessive drinking.      While making Bride of the Monster in late 1955, Wood married Norma McCarty. McCarty appeared as Edie, the airplane stewardess in Plan 9 from Outer Space. The marriage was  |annulled|Annulled|  in 1956.      Wood married his second wife, Kathy OHara, in 1959. They remained married until Woods death in 1978.  Kathy died on June 26, 2006, having never remarried.       In Woods 1992 biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr., Woods wife Kathy recalls that Wood told her that his mother dressed him in girls clothing as a child. Kathy stated that Woods transvestism was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from  |angora|Angora_Wool|  fabric . Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as Shirley, his female alter ego .       By 1978, Woods depression had worsened, and he and his wife Kathy had both become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend, actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking  |vodka|Vodka| . Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coes bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink, which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, Kathy, I cant breathe! , a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood bossing her around. After hearing no movement in the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a  |heart_attack|Heart_Attack| . Kathy later said, I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. Ill never forget the look in his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like hed seen hell .     Wood was  |cremated|Cremation| , and his ashes were scattered at sea.       In 1986 in an essay paying homage to Wood in  Incredibly Strange Films , Jim Morton wrote: Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a man born to film. Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat .     In 1994 director  |Tim_Burton|Tim_Burton|  released the biopic  Ed Wood , starring  |Johnny_Depp|Johnny_Depp|  in the title role and  |Martin_Landau|Martin_Landau| , who won an  |Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor|Academy_Award_For_Best_Supporting_Actor|  for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. It also won an  |Academy_Award_for_Best_Makeup|Academy_Award_For_Best_Makeup|  for  |Rick_Baker|Rick_Baker| .  |Conrad_Brooks|Conrad_Brooks|  appeared in the movie, in a cameo role of Barman, along with  |Gregory_Walcott|Gregory_Walcott|  as a potential Backer. The film received mass critical acclaim, but did poorly at the box office. It has since developed a  |cult_following|Cult_Following| .     In 1996 Reverend Steve Galindo of Seminole, Oklahoma, created a legally recognized religion with Wood as its official savior.  Founded as a joke, the Church of Ed Wood now boasts more than 3,500 baptized followers. Woodites, as Galindos followers are called, celebrate Woodmas on October 10, which was Woods birthday. Numerous parties and concerts are held worldwide to celebrate Woodmas.

Past themes have included Rebel Without a Bra , Whats That in Your Pocket? , and Slippery When Wet .        From 1993 to 1994, three of Woods films  were featured on the television series  Mystery Science Theater 3000 , which gave those works wider exposure. Producers of MST3K considered including Plan 9, but found it had too much dialogue for the shows format.     In 1998, Woods previously unfilmed script  I Woke Up Early the Day I Died  was finally produced, starring  |Billy_Zane|Billy_Zane|  and  |Christina_Ricci|Christina_Ricci| , with appearances by  |Tippi_Hedren|Tippi_Hedren| ,  |Bud_Cort|Bud_Cort| ,  |Sandra_Bernhard|Sandra_Bernhard| ,  |Karen_Black|Karen_Black| ,  |John_Ritter|John_Ritter|  and many others.

In 2005, the Plan 9 cast were lampooned in an episode of the television series  Deadly Cinema ; the following year, clips of this episode were featured in the documentary Vampira: The Movie.      In 2006, MST3K head writer and host  |Michael_J._Nelson|Michael_J._Nelson|  recorded an audio commentary track for a DVD release of a  |colorized|Film_Colorization|  version of Plan 9 from Outer Space.
