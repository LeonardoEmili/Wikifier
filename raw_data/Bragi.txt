           Bragi is the  |skald|Skald| ic god of  |poetry|Poetry|  in  |Norse_mythology|Norse_Mythology| .       Bragi is generally associated with bragr, the Norse word for  |poetry|Poetry| . The name of the god may have been derived from bragr, or the term bragr may have been formed to describe what Bragi does. A connection between the name Bragi and Old English brego chieftain has been suggested but is generally now discounted. A connection between Bragi and the bragarfull promise cup is sometimes suggested, as bragafull, an alternate form of the word, might be translated as Bragis cup. See  Bragarfull .                   |Snorri_Sturluson|Snorri_Sturluson|  writes in the  Gylfaginning  after describing  |Odin|Odin| ,  |Thor|Thor| , and  |Baldr|Baldr|      In  Skáldskaparmál  Snorri writes:        That Bragi is Odins son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin . But wish-son in stanza 16 of the  Lokasenna  could mean Odins son and is translated by Hollander as Odins kin. Bragis mother is possibly the giantess  |Gunnlod|Gunnlod| . If Bragis mother is  |Frigg|Frigg| , then Frigg is somewhat dismissive of Bragi in the Lokasenna in stanza 27 when Frigg complains that if she had a son in  |Ægirs|Ægir|  hall as brave as  |Baldr|Baldr|  then  |Loki|Loki|  would have to fight for his life.     In that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the  |Æsir|Æsir|  and  |Elves|Elves|  within the hall. Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Lokis head, but Loki only repeats the accusation. When Bragis wife Iðunn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her brothers slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain Iðunns brother.     A passage in the Poetic Edda poem  Sigrdrífumál  describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on  |Sleipnirs|Sleipnir|  teeth, on bears paw, on eagles beak, on wolfs claw, and on several other things including on Bragis tongue. Then the runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that Æsir have some, Elves have some,  |Vanir|Vanir|  have some, and Men have some, these being speech runes and birth runes, ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.     The first part of Snorri Sturlusons  Skáldskaparmál  is a dialogue between  |Ægir|Ægir|  and Bragi about the nature of poetry, particularly skaldic poetry. Bragi tells the origin of the mead of poetry from the blood of  |Kvasir|Kvasir|  and how Odin obtained this mead. He then goes on to discuss various poetic metaphors known as  kenning s.     Snorri Sturluson clearly distinguishes the god Bragi from the mortal skald  |Bragi_Boddason|Bragi_Boddason| , whom he often mentions separately. The appearance of Bragi in the Lokasenna indicates that if these two Bragis were originally the same, they have become separated for that author also, or that chronology has become very muddled and Bragi Boddason has been relocated to mythological time. Compare the appearance of the  |Welsh|Wales| |_Taliesin|Taliesin|  in the second branch of the  |Mabinogi|Mabinogion| . Legendary chronology sometimes does become muddled. Whether Bragi the god originally arose as a deified version of Bragi Boddason was much debated in the 19th century, especially by the scholars  |Eugen_Mogk|Eugen_Mogk|  and  |Sophus_Bugge|Sophus_Bugge| .  |John_Lindow|John_Lindow| , Narrative worlds, human environments, and poets: The case of Bragi , in Old Norse Religion in Long-Term Perspectives: Origins, Changes, and Interactions, ed. Anders Andrén, Kristina Jennbert and Catharina Raudvere, Vägar till Midgård 8, Lund: Nordic Academic Press, 2012, , pp.  21  25, . The debate remains undecided.     In the poem  Eiríksmál  Odin, in  |Valhalla|Valhalla| , hears the coming of the dead  |Norwegian|Norway|  king  |Eric_Bloodaxe|Eric_Bloodaxe|  and his host, and bids the heroes  |Sigmund|Sigmund|  and  |Sinfjötli|Sinfjötli|  rise to greet him. Bragi is then mentioned, questioning how Odin knows that it is Eric and why Odin has let such a king die. In the poem  Hákonarmál , Hákon the Good is taken to Valhalla by the  |valkyrie|Valkyrie| |_Göndul|Göndul|  and Odin sends  |Hermóðr|Hermóðr|  and Bragi to greet him. In these poems Bragi could be either a god or a dead hero in Valhalla. Attempting to decide is further confused because Hermóðr also seems to be sometimes the name of a god and sometimes the name of a hero. That Bragi was also the first to speak to Loki in the Lokasenna as Loki attempted to enter the hall might be a parallel. It might have been useful and customary that a man of great eloquence and versed in poetry should greet those entering a hall. He is also depicted in tenth-century court poetry of helping to prepare Valhalla for new arrivals and welcoming the kings who have been slain in battle to the hall of Odin.               In the Prose Edda Snorri Sturluson quotes many stanzas attributed to Bragi Boddason the old , a Norwegian court poet who served several Swedish kings,  |Ragnar_Lodbrok|Ragnar_Lodbrok| ,  |Östen_Beli|Östen_Beli|  and  |Björn_at_Hauge|Björn_At_Hauge|  who reigned in the first half of the 9th century. This Bragi was reckoned as the first skaldic poet, and was certainly the earliest skaldic poet then remembered by name whose verse survived in memory.     Snorri especially quotes passages from Bragis  Ragnarsdrápa , a poem supposedly composed in honor of the famous legendary Viking  |Ragnar_Lodbrók|Ragnar_Lodbrok|  describing the images on a decorated shield which Ragnar had given to Bragi. The images included Thors fishing for  |Jörmungandr|Jörmungandr| ,  |Gefjuns|Gefjun|  ploughing of  |Zealand|Zealand|  from the soil of Sweden, the attack of  |Hamdir_and_Sorli|Hamdir_And_Sorli|  against King  |Jörmunrekk|Ermanaric| , and the never-ending battle between  |Hedin_and_Högni|Hedin_And_Högni| .       Bragi son of Hálfdan the Old is mentioned only in the Skjáldskaparmál. This Bragi is the sixth of the second of two groups of nine sons fathered by King Hálfdan the Old on Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymund of  |Hólmgard|Novgorod| . This second group of sons are all eponymous ancestors of legendary families of the north. Snorri says:     Bragi, from whom the Bragnings are sprung .     Of the Bragnings as a race and of Hálfdan the Generous nothing else is known. However, Bragning is often, like some others of these dynastic names, used in poetry as a general word for king or ruler.       In the eddic poem  Helgakviða Hundingsbana II , Bragi Högnason, his brother Dag, and his sister Sigrún were children of  |Högne|Högne| , the king of  |East_Götaland|East_Götaland| . The poem relates how  |Sigmunds|Sigmund|  son  |Helgi_Hundingsbane|Helgi_Hundingsbane|  agreed to take Sigrún daughter of Högni as his wife against her unwilling betrothal to Hodbrodd son of  |Granmar|Granmar|  the king of  |Södermanland|Södermanland| . In the subsequent battle of Frekastein  .
