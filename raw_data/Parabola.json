In the following proof, the fact that every point on the parabola is equidistant from the focus and from the directrix is taken as axiomatic.     Consider the parabola . Since all parabolas are similar, this simple case represents all others. The right-hand side of the diagram shows part of this parabola.       The point E is an arbitrary point on the parabola, with coordinates . The focus is F, the vertex is A , and the line   is the axis of symmetry. The line  is parallel to the axis of symmetry, and intersects the -axis at D. The point C is located on the directrix . The point B is the midpoint of the line segment .       Measured along the axis of symmetry, the vertex, A, is equidistant from the focus, F, and from the directrix. According to the ": null

        ", since C is on the directrix, the -coordinates of F and C are equal in absolute value and opposite in sign. B is the midpoint of FC, so its -coordinate is zero, so it lies on the -axis. Its -coordinate is half that of E, D, and C, i.e., . The slope of the line  is the quotient of the lengths of  and , which is , which comes to . But  is also the slope of the parabola at E. Therefore, the line  is the tangent to the parabola at E.     The distances  and  are equal because E is on the parabola, F is the focus and C is on the directrix. Therefore, since B is the midpoint of , triangles △FEB and △CEB are congruent , which implies that the angles marked  are congruent. This means that a ray of light which enters the parabola and arrives at E travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry will be reflected by the line  so it travels along the line , as shown in red in the diagram . Since  is the tangent to the parabola at E, the same reflection will be done by an infinitesimal arc of the parabola at E. Therefore, light that enters the parabola and arrives at E travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola is reflected by the parabola toward its focus.     The point E has no special characteristics. This conclusion about reflected light applies to all points on the parabola, as is shown on the left side of the diagram. This is the reflective property.       There are other theorems that can be deduced simply from the above argument.       The above proof and the accompanying diagram show that the tangent  bisects the angle ∠FEC. In other words, the tangent to the parabola at any point bisects the angle between the lines joining the point to the focus, and perpendicularly to the directrix.          Since triangles △FBE and △CBE are congruent,  is perpendicular to the tangent . Since B is on the -axis, which is the tangent to the parabola at its vertex, it follows that the point of intersection between any tangent to a parabola and the perpendicular from the focus to that tangent lies on the line that is tangential to the parabola at its vertex.

The above proofs of the reflective and tangent bisection properties use a line of calculus. For readers who are not comfortable with calculus, the following alternative is presented.
