           An expert is someone who has a broad and deep  |competence|Competence|  in terms of  |knowledge|Knowledge| ,  |skill|Skill|  and  |experience|Experience|  through practice and education in a particular field. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a  |reliable|Reliabilism|  source of  |technique|Wikt:Technique|  or  |skill|Skill|  whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by  |peers|Peer_Group|  or the  |public|General_Public|  in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive  |knowledge|Knowledge|  or  |ability|Aptitude|  based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of  |credentials|Credential| ,  |training|Training| ,  |education|Education| ,  |profession|Profession| ,  |publication|Publication|  or  |experience|Experience| , to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may  |official|Official| ly  rely upon the individuals  |opinion|Opinion|  on that topic. Historically, an expert was referred to as a  |sage|Wise_Old_Man|  . The individual was usually a profound  |thinker|Intellectual|  distinguished for  |wisdom|Wisdom|  and sound  |judgment|Judgment| .     In specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic  |qualification|Wikt:Qualification|  for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from  |computer_science|Computer_Science|  is that an  |expert_system|Expert_System|  may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In  |law|Law| , an  |expert_witness|Expert_Witness|  must be recognized by  |argument|Logical_Argument|  and  |authority|Authority| .     Research in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.        Expertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert  |medical_specialists|Medical_Specialist|  are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.     The word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.       There are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of  |communities_of_practice|Communities_Of_Practice| . In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.     In the second view expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years experience  deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the  |nature_and_nurture|Nature_And_Nurture|  argument. Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.        In the field of education there is a potential expert blind spot  in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the expert blind spot hypothesis researched by  |Mitchell_Nathan|Mitchell_J._Nathan|  and Andrew Petrosino . Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.     The blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices’ cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts’ and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed . Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter . Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators’ experience with instructing learners over time.          In line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of  |power|Power| ; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elites power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the  |printing_press|Printing_Press|  in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.     Platos  |Noble_Lie|Noble_Lie|  , concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and societys best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city the noble lie to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.     In contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman.  However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries, despite not understanding it.       A number of computational models have been developed in  |cognitive_science|Cognitive_Science|  to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular,  |Herbert_A._Simon|Herbert_A._Simon|  and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP . Simon and Gilmartin Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000  |chunks|Chunking_Chunking_As_The_Learning_Of_Long-Term_Memory_Structures|  are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the  |CHREST_model|Chrest|  has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise and in other domains.       An important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on Skilled Memory and Expertise by  |Anders_Ericsson|Anders_Ericsson|  and  |James_J._Staszewski|James_J._Staszewski|  confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.     Work on  |expert_systems|Expert_Systems|  typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.     In a critique of the expert systems literature  suggest:   If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. … No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.          The role of long term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long term memory mediated experts rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects prior experience. Experts chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long term memory.     Skilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.     The first principle of skilled memory, the meaningful encoding principle, states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.     The second principle, the retrieval structure principle states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.     The third principle, the speed up principle states that long term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short term memory storage and retrieval.     Examples of skilled memory research described within the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:   a waiter who can accurately remember up to 20 complete dinner orders in an actual restaurant setting by using mnemonic strategy, patterns, and spatial relations . At the time of recall all items of a category would be recalled in clockwise for all customers.   a running enthusiast who grouped together short random sequences of digits and encoded the groups in terms of their meaning as running times, dates, and ages. He was thus able to recall over 84% of all digit groups presented in a session totaling 200-300 digits. His expertise was limited to digits; when a switch from digits to letters of the alphabet was made he exhibited no transfer—his memory span dropped back to about six consonants.   math enthusiasts .
