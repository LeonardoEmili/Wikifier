              Sherlock Holmes  is a fictional  |private_detective|Private_Investigator|  created by British author  |Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle|Arthur_Conan_Doyle| . Referring to himself as a consulting detective in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation,  |forensic_science|Forensic_Science| , and  |logical_reasoning|Logical_Reasoning|  that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including  |Scotland_Yard|Scotland_Yard| .     First appearing in print in 1887s  A Study in Scarlet , the characters popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in  The Strand Magazine , beginning with  |A_Scandal_in_Bohemia|A_Scandal_In_Bohemia|  in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling  |four_novels_and_56_short_stories|Canon_Of_Sherlock_Holmes| . All but one are set in the  |Victorian|Victorian_Era|  or  |Edwardian|Edwardian_Era|  eras, between about 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmess friend and biographer  |Dr._Watson|Dr._Watson| , who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of  |221B_Baker_Street|221B_Baker_Street| , London, where many of the stories begin.     Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best known,  with  Guinness World Records  listing him as the most portrayed movie character in history. , The Daily Telegraph 15 December 2009. Retrieved 23 April 2010. Holmess popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual;   numerous literary and fan societies have been founded that pretend to operate on  |this_principle|Sherlockian_Game| . Widely considered a  |British_cultural_icon|List_Of_Cultural_Icons_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , the character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on  |mystery_writing|Detective_Fiction|  and  |popular_culture|Popular_Culture_References_To_Sherlock_Holmes|  as a whole, with the original tales as well as thousands  |written_by_authors_other_than_Conan_Doyle|Sherlock_Holmes_Pastiches|  being  |adapted|Adaptations_Of_Sherlock_Holmes|  into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.          Inspiration for the character      |Edgar_Allan_Poes|Edgar_Allan_Poe| |C._Auguste_Dupin|C._Auguste_Dupin|  is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes.    Conan Doyle once wrote, Each is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?  Similarly, the stories of  |Émile_Gaboriaus|Émile_Gaboriau| |Monsieur_Lecoq|Monsieur_Lecoq|  were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes speech and behaviour sometimes follow that of Lecoq.  Holmes and Watson discuss Dupin and Lecoq at the beginning of A Study in Scarlet.     Conan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of  |Joseph_Bell|Joseph_Bell| , a surgeon at the  |Royal_Infirmary_of_Edinburgh|Royal_Infirmary_Of_Edinburgh| , whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations.  However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it .  Sir  |Henry_Littlejohn|Henry_Littlejohn| , Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the  |University_of_Edinburgh_Medical_School|University_Of_Edinburgh_Medical_School| , is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.      Other inspirations have been proposed, such as Maximilien Heller, by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel , Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smoking polymath detective, operating in Paris.    It is not known if Conan Doyle read the novel, but he was fluent in French.   |Michael_Harrison|Michael_Harrison|  has suggested that a German self-styled consulting detective named Walter Scherer may have been the model for Holmes.               Details about Sherlock Holmes life are scarce in Conan Doyles stories. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.     An estimate of Holmess age in  |His_Last_Bow|His_Last_Bow|  places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age.  His parents are not mentioned in the stories, although Holmes mentions that his ancestors were country  |squires|Squires|  . In  |The_Adventure_of_the_Greek_Interpreter|The_Adventure_Of_The_Greek_Interpreter|  , he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was  |Claude_Joseph|Claude_Joseph_Vernet| ,  |Carle|Carle_Vernet| , or  |Horace_Vernet|Horace_Vernet| . Holmess brother  |Mycroft|Mycroft_Holmes| , seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique  |civil_service|Civil_Service|  position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. He lacks Sherlocks interest in physical investigation, however, preferring to spend his time at the  |Diogenes_Club|Diogenes_Club| .     Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students. A meeting with a classmates father led him to adopt detection as a profession,  |The_Adventure_of_the_Gloria_Scott|The_Adventure_Of_The_Gloria_Scott|  and he spent several years after university as a consultant before financial difficulties led him to accept  |John_H._Watson|Dr._Watson|  as a fellow lodger.     The two take lodgings at  |221B_Baker_Street|221B_Baker_Street| , London, an apartment at the upper end of the street, up seventeen steps. .       Life with Watson     Holmes worked as a detective for twenty-three years, with physician John Watson assisting him for seventeen.  |The_Adventure_of_the_Veiled_Lodger|The_Adventure_Of_The_Veiled_Lodger|  They were roommates before Watsons 1888 marriage and again after  |his_wifes|Mary_Morstan|  death. Their residence is maintained by their landlady,  |Mrs._Hudson|Mrs_Hudson| . Most of the stories are  |frame_narratives|Frame_Narrative| , written from Watsons point of view as summaries of the detectives most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watsons writing sensational and populist, suggesting that it fails to accurately and objectively report the science of his craft:          Nevertheless, Holmess friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. When Watson is injured by a bullet, although the wound turns out to be quite superficial , Watson is moved by Holmess reaction:            Holmes clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy  |aristocrats|Aristocracy|  and  |industrialists|Industrialist| , to impoverished  |pawnbrokers|Pawnbroker|  and  |governess|Governess| es. He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watsons stories raises Holmes profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of that of the police The Adventure of the Reigate Squire and The Adventure of the Illustrious Client are two examples. that, Watson writes, by 1895 Holmes has an immense practice . The Adventure of Black Peter Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby, even during a vacation. The Adventure of the Reigate Squire A  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  The Adventure of the Second Stain and the  |King_of_Bohemia|King_Of_Bohemia|  A Scandal in Bohemia visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmess assistance; the  |government_of_France|Cabinet_Of_France|  awards him its  |Legion_of_Honour|Legion_Of_Honour|  for solving a case; The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez the King of Scandinavia is a client;  |The_Adventure_of_the_Noble_Bachelor|The_Adventure_Of_The_Noble_Bachelor|  and he aids the  |Vatican|Holy_See|  at least twice. The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventure of Black Peter The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times,  |The_Adventure_of_the_Bruce-Partington_Plans|The_Adventure_Of_The_Bruce-Partington_Plans|  ,  |The_Adventure_of_the_Naval_Treaty|The_Adventure_Of_The_Naval_Treaty|  , and after retirement,  |His_Last_Bow|His_Last_Bow|  . and declines a  |knighthood|Knight_Bachelor|  for services which may perhaps some day be described .     The Great Hiatus   The first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Wishing to devote more time to his historical novels, Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind  |Professor_James_Moriarty|Professor_Moriarty|  in The Final Problem . Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes death that they wore black armbands in mourning. However, there is no known contemporary source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949.      After resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote  The Hound of the Baskervilles  . In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote The Adventure of the Empty House , set in 1894; Holmes reappears, explaining to a stunned Watson that he had faked his death to fool his enemies. The Adventure of the Empty House marks the beginning of the second set of stories, which Conan Doyle wrote until 1927.Holmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894—between his disappearance and presumed death in The Final Problem and his reappearance in The Adventure of the Empty House —as the Great Hiatus. The earliest known use of this expression is in the article Sherlock Holmes and the Great Hiatus by Edgar W. Smith, published in the July 1946 issue of The Baker Street Journal.        In His Last Bow , Holmes has retired to a small farm on the  |Sussex_Downs|South_Downs|  and taken up  |beekeeping|Beekeeping|  as his primary occupation. The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 . The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the  |war|World_War_I|  effort. Only one other adventure,  |The_Adventure_of_the_Lions_Mane|The_Adventure_Of_The_Lions_Mane|  , takes place during the detectives retirement.     Personality and habits   Watson describes Holmes as  |bohemian|Bohemianism|  in his habits and lifestyle. Described by Watson in  The Hound of the Baskervilles  as having a cat-like love of personal cleanliness, Holmes is an  |eccentric|Eccentricity|  with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. In many of the stories, Holmes dives into an apparent mess to find a relevant item. In  |The_Adventure_of_the_Musgrave_Ritual|The_Adventure_Of_The_Musgrave_Ritual|  , Watson says:          The detective starves himself at times of intense intellectual activity, such as during  |The_Adventure_of_the_Norwood_Builder|The_Adventure_Of_The_Norwood_Builder|  —wherein, according to Watson:             While the detective is usually dispassionate and cold, during an investigation he is animated and excitable. He has a flair for showmanship, preparing elaborate traps to capture and expose a culprit . See, for example, Inspector Lestrade at the end of  |The_Adventure_of_the_Norwood_Builder|The_Adventure_Of_The_Norwood_Builder|  . His companion condones the detectives willingness to bend the truth on behalf of a client—lying to the police, concealing evidence or breaking into houses—when he feels it morally justifiable,  |The_Adventure_of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton|The_Adventure_Of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton|  and  |The_Adventure_of_the_Illustrious_Client|The_Adventure_Of_The_Illustrious_Client|  but condemns Holmes manipulation of innocent people in  |The_Adventure_of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton|The_Adventure_Of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton|  . Holmes derives pleasure from baffling police inspectors with his deductions and has supreme confidence—bordering on arrogance—in his intellectual abilities. While the detective does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work, In  The Adventure of the Naval Treaty , Holmes remarks that, of his last fifty-three cases, the police have had all the credit in forty-nine. he is pleased when his skills are recognised and responds to flattery.     Except for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In  |The_Adventure_of_the_Gloria_Scott|The_Adventure_Of_The_Gloria_Scott| , he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson ... I never mixed much with the men of my year . The detective is similarly described in A Study in Scarlet.     As shooting practice during a period of boredom, Holmes decorates the wall of his Baker Street lodgings with a patriotic VR  in bullet-pocks from his revolver. Holmes relaxes with music in  |The_Red-Headed_League|The_Red-Headed_League|  , taking the evening off from a case to listen to  |Pablo_de_Sarasate|Pablo_De_Sarasate|  play violin. His enjoyment of vocal music, particularly  |Wagner|Richard_Wagner| , is evident in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Red_Circle|The_Adventure_Of_The_Red_Circle|  .     Drug use   Holmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases. He uses  |cocaine|Cocaine| , which he injects in a seven-percent solution with a  |syringe|Syringe|  kept in a  |Morocco_leather|Morocco_Leather|  case. Although Holmes also dabbles in  |morphine|Morphine| , he expresses strong disapproval when he visits an  |opium_den|Opium_Den| ; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England. As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friends cocaine habit, describing it as the detectives only vice , and concerned about its effect on Holmess  |mental_health|Mental_Health|  and intellect.  The Sign of Four In  |The_Adventure_of_the_Missing_Three-Quarter|The_Adventure_Of_The_Missing_Three-Quarter|  , Watson says that although he has weaned Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is not dead, but merely sleeping .     Watson and Holmes both use tobacco, smoking cigarettes, cigars, and  |pipes|Smoking_Pipe| . Although his chronicler does not consider Holmess smoking a vice per se, Watson—a physician—occasionally criticises the detective for creating a poisonous atmosphere in their confined quarters.  The Hound of the Baskervilles      Finances |The_Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band|The_Adventure_Of_The_Speckled_Band|  , The Red-Headed League , and  |The_Adventure_of_the_Beryl_Coronet|The_Adventure_Of_The_Beryl_Coronet|  . In  |The_Problem_of_Thor_Bridge|The_Problem_Of_Thor_Bridge|  , the detective says, My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether . In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate. In  |The_Adventure_of_the_Priory_School|The_Adventure_Of_The_Priory_School|  , Holmes earns a £6,000 fee, an amount that surprises even Watson .  However, in  |The_Adventure_of_Black_Peter|The_Adventure_Of_Black_Peter|  , Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.     Although when the stories begin Holmes needed Watson to share the rent for their residence, by the time of The Final Problem , he says that his services to the government of France and the royal family of Scandinavia had left him with enough money to retire comfortably.     Attitudes towards women |Babbages|Babbage|  calculating machine and just about as likely to fall in love .  Holmes says in The Valley of Fear, I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind ,  and in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Second_Stain|The_Adventure_Of_The_Second_Stain|  finds the motives of women  ... inscrutable  .... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes  ... their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tongs .  In The Sign of the Four, he says, I would not tell them too much. Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them .      Watson says in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Copper_Beeches|The_Adventure_Of_The_Copper_Beeches|  that the detective inevitably manifested no further interest in the client when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems . In  |The_Lions_Mane|The_Lions_Mane|  , Holmes writes, Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart, indicating that he has been attracted to women in some way on occasion, but has not been interested in pursuing relationships with them. Ultimately, however, in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Devils_Foot|The_Adventure_Of_The_Devils_Foot|  , he claims outright that I have never loved . At the end of The Sign of Four, Holmes states that love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.     Despite his overall attitude, Holmes is adept at effortlessly putting his clients at ease, and Watson says that although the detective has an aversion to women , he has a peculiarly ingratiating way with . Watson notes in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Dying_Detective|The_Adventure_Of_The_Dying_Detective|  that Mrs. Hudson is fond of Holmes because of his remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent .  In  |The_Adventure_of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton|The_Adventure_Of_Charles_Augustus_Milverton|  , the detective easily manages to become  |engaged|Engagement|  under false pretenses in order to obtain information about a case, but also abandons the woman once he has the information he requires.        |Irene_Adler|Irene_Adler|  is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in  |A_Scandal_in_Bohemia|A_Scandal_In_Bohemia|  . Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who best Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman. For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of  |pastiche|Pastiche|  writing. The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:          Five years before the storys events, Adler had a brief liaison with Crown Prince of  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  Wilhelm von Ormstein. As the story opens, the Prince is engaged to another. Fearful that the marriage would be called off if his fiancées family learns of this past impropriety, Ormstein hires Holmes to regain a photograph of Adler and himself. Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed. Her memory is kept alive by the photograph of Adler that Holmes received for his part in the case, and he refers to her from time to time in subsequent stories.       Shortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, A Study in Scarlet , Watson assesses the detectives abilities:          Subsequent stories reveal that Watsons early assessment was incomplete in places and inaccurate in others, due to the passage of time if nothing else. At the end of A Study in Scarlet, Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of  |Latin|Latin| . Despite Holmess supposed ignorance of politics, in A Scandal in Bohemia he immediately recognises the true identity of Count von Kramm . His speech is peppered with references to the Bible,  |Shakespeare|Shakespeare| , and  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe| , and the detective quotes  |a_letter|Flauberts_Letters|  from  |Gustave_Flaubert|Gustave_Flaubert|  to  |George_Sand|George_Sand|  in the original French. At the end of A Case of Identity , Holmes quotes  |Hafez|Hafez| . In The Hound of the Baskervilles, the detective recognises works by  |Martin_Knoller|Martin_Knoller|  and  |Joshua_Reynolds|Joshua_Reynolds| |Motets|Motet|  of  |Lassus|Lassus|  , considered the last word on the subject; to be able to do that, Holmes must have had a very specific and detailed musicological knowledge, which could not be of any use in detecting crime.  Holmes is also a  |cryptanalyst|Cryptanalyst| , telling Watson in The Adventure of the Dancing Men : I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers .      In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes claims to be unaware that the earth revolves around the sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces ones ability to learn useful things. The later stories move away from this notion: in  The Valley of Fear , he says, All knowledge comes useful to the detective , and in The Adventure of the Lions Mane , the detective calls himself an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles .     Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of psychology in A Scandal in Bohemia , luring Irene Adler into betraying where she hid a photograph based on the premise that an unmarried woman will save her most valued possession from a fire. Another example is in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Blue_Carbuncle|The_Adventure_Of_The_Blue_Carbuncle|  , where Holmes obtains information from a salesman with a wager: When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and  |the_Pink_un|The_Sporting_Times|  protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet  .... I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager .      |Maria_Konnikova|Maria_Konnikova|  points out in an interview with  |D._J._Grothe|D._J._Grothe|  that Holmes practices what is now called mindfulness, concentrating on one thing at a time, and almost never multitasks. She adds that in this he predates the science showing how helpful this is to the brain.             Though the stories always refer to Holmes intellectual detection method as  |deduction|Deductive_Reasoning|  , he primarily relies on  |abduction|Abductive_Reasoning| |inferring|Inference|  an explanation for observed details.    From a drop of water , he writes, a logician could infer the possibility of an  |Atlantic|Atlantic_Ocean|  or a  |Niagara|Niagara_Falls|  without having seen or heard of one or the other . A Study in Scarlet     In A Scandal in Bohemia , Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had a most clumsy and careless servant girl . When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:          In the first Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, Dr. Watson compares Holmes to  |C._Auguste_Dupin|C._Auguste_Dupin| , Edgar Allan Poes fictional detective, who employed a similar methodology. Alluding to an episode in  |The_Murders_in_the_Rue_Morgue|The_Murders_In_The_Rue_Morgue|  , where Dupin determines what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: That trick of his breaking in on his friends thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial . Nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same trick on Watson in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Cardboard_Box|The_Adventure_Of_The_Cardboard_Box|  and again in  |The_Adventure_of_the_Dancing_Men|The_Adventure_Of_The_Dancing_Men|  .     This methodology allows Holmes to learn a strangers occupation and other details. He observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks , contamination , emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a persons clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories Holmes is seen applying his method to walking sticks, The Hound of the Baskervilles pipes,  |The_Adventure_of_the_Yellow_Face|The_Adventure_Of_The_Yellow_Face|  hats,  |The_Adventure_of_the_Blue_Carbuncle|The_Adventure_Of_The_Blue_Carbuncle|  . and other objects.     Holmes does employ deductive reasoning as well. The detectives guiding principle, as he says in The Sign of the Four and other stories, is: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth .      Despite Holmes remarkable reasoning abilities, Conan Doyle still paints him as fallible in this regard .            Though Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy .     The detective is particularly skilled in the analysis of  |trace_evidence|Trace_Evidence|  and other physical evidence, including latent prints to identify actions at a crime scene ; using tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals ;  |handwriting_analysis|Questioned_Document_Examination|  and  |graphology|Graphology|  ; comparing typewritten letters to expose a fraud ; using gunpowder residue to expose two murderers ; comparing bullets from two crime scenes ; analyzing small pieces of human remains to expose two murders , and an early use of  |fingerprints|Fingerprintmodern_Era|  .     Because of the small scale of much of his evidence, the detective often uses a magnifying glass at the scene and an  |optical_microscope|Optical_Microscope|  at his Baker Street lodgings. He uses  |analytical_chemistry|Analytical_Chemistry|  for  |blood_residue|Blood_Residue|  analysis and  |toxicology|Toxicology|  to detect poisons; Holmess home chemistry laboratory is mentioned in The Adventure of the Naval Treaty .  |Ballistics|Ballistics|  feature in The Adventure of the Empty House when spent bullets are recovered and matched with a suspected murder weapon.
