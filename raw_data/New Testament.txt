                     The New Testament  is the second part of the  |Christian_biblical_canon|Christian_Biblical_Canons| , the first being the  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament| . The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of  |Jesus|Jesus_In_Christianity| , as well as events in  |first-century_Christianity|Christianity_In_The_1St_Century| . Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as  |sacred_scripture|Religious_Text| .     The New Testament is a collection of Christian texts originally written in the  |Koine_Greek|Koine_Greek|  language, at different times by various different authors. While the Old Testament canon varies somewhat between different  |Christian_denominations|Christian_Denomination| , the  |27-book_canon|Development_Of_The_New_Testament_Canon|  of the New Testament has been almost universally recognized within  |Christianity|Christianity|  since at least  |Late_Antiquity|Late_Antiquity| . Thus, in almost all Christian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books: the four  |canonical_gospels|Canonical_Gospels|  , the  |Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostles| , the fourteen  |epistles_of_Paul|Pauline_Epistles| , the seven  |catholic_epistles|Catholic_Epistles| , and the  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation| .     The earliest known complete list of the 27 books of the New Testament is found in a letter written by  |Athanasius|Athanasius| , a 4th-century  |bishop|Bishop|  of  |Alexandria|Alexandria| , dated to 367 AD.  The 27-book New Testament was first formally canonized during the councils of  |Hippo|Council_Of_Hippo|  and  |Carthage|Council_Of_Carthage|  in North Africa.  |Pope|Pope| |Innocent_I|Innocent_I|  ratified the same canon in 405, but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under  |Pope_Damasus_I|Pope_Damasus_I|  gave the same list first. These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament, which included the  |apocryphal|Biblical_Apocrypha|  books. Introduction to the New Testament. Werner Georg Kummel. Abingdon Press. Nashville. 1993.     There is no  |scholarly_consensus|Scholarly_Consensus|  on the date of composition of the latest New Testament texts. Conservative scholars  |John_A._T._Robinson|John_Robinson_Redating_The_New_Testament| ,  |Dan_Wallace|Daniel_B._Wallace| , and  |William_F._Albright|William_F._Albright|  dated all the books of the New Testament before 70 AD.  But most scholars date some New Testament texts much later than this. For example,  |Richard_Pervo|Richard_Pervo|  dates  |Luke-Acts|Luke-Acts|  to c. AD 115,  and  |David_Trobisch|David_Trobisch|  places  |Acts|Acts_Of_The_Apostles|  in the mid- to late second century, contemporaneous with the publication of the first New Testament canon.  ...Acts provides information that makes it possible to identify Luke, the author of the Gospel, as the doctor who travels with Paul and to identify Mark as someone close to Peter and Paul. This canon consciousness suggests that the book of Acts was composed at a later date than is typically thought; this theory is supported by the first attestation of the book around 180 CE. - Trobisch 2007       The use of the phrase New Testament  to describe a collection of first and second-century Christian Greek scriptures can be traced back to  |Tertullian|Tertullian|  in his work Against Praxeas .   If I fail in resolving this article by passages which may admit of dispute out of the Old Testament, I will take out of the New Testament a confirmation of our view, that you may not straightway attribute to the Father every possible which I ascribe to the Son. -  |Tertullian|Tertullian| , http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0317.htm Against Praxeas 15 Irenaeus uses the phrase New Testament several times, but does not use it in reference to any written text. In Against Marcion , written c.  208  AD, Tertullian writes of: Tertullian. Chapter XIV . .        And Tertullian continues later in the book, writing: Tertullian. Chapter VI . . See also Tertullian, , chapters I, II, XIV. However, his meaning in chapter XX is less clear, and in chapters IX and XL he uses the term to mean new covenant.        By the  |4th_century|Christianity_In_The_4Th_Century| , the existence—even if not the exact contents—of both an Old and New Testament had been established.  |Lactantius|Lactantius| , a 3rd–4th century Christian author wrote in his early-4th-century Latin Institutiones Divinae .                    Each of the four  |gospels|Gospels|  in the New Testament narrates the life, death, and resurrection of  |Jesus|Jesus|  of  |Nazareth|Nazareth| . The word gospel derives from the  |Old_English|Old_English_Language|  gōd-spell  , meaning good news or glad tidings . The gospel was considered the good news of the coming  |Kingdom_of_Messiah|Messiahchristianity| , and the redemption through the life and death of Jesus, the central Christian message. Cross, F. L., ed . Gospel . The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. Gospel is a  |calque|Calque|  of the  |Greek|Koine_Greek|  word , euangelion .     Starting in the late second century, the four narrative accounts of the life and work of Jesus Christ have been referred to as The Gospel of ... or The Gospel according to ... followed by the name of the supposed author. The first author to explicitly name the canonical gospels is  |Irenaeus|Irenaeus|  of Lyon,  |Irenaeus|Irenaeus| , http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103311.htm Against Heresies III.11 who promoted the four canonical gospels in his book  |Against_Heresies|Against_Heresies| , written around 180. Due to its reference to  |Eleutherus|Eleutherus|  as the current  |bishop_of_Rome|Bishop_Of_Rome| , the work is usually dated .  |Schaff,_Philip|Philip_Schaff|    ,  Ante-Nicene Fathers , Volume I, Against Heresies,  |William_B._Eerdmans_Publishing_Company|William_B._Eerdmans_Publishing_Company| . Whatever these admittedly early ascriptions may imply about the sources behind or the perception of these gospels, they are anonymous compositions.   The  |Gospel_of_Matthew|Gospel_Of_Matthew| , ascribed to the  |Apostle_Matthew|Matthew_The_Evangelist| . This gospel begins with a  |genealogy_of_Jesus|Genealogy_Of_Jesus|  and a story of his birth that includes a visit from  |magi|Biblical_Magi|  and a  |flight_into_Egypt|Flight_Into_Egypt| , and it ends with the  |commissioning_of_the_disciples|Great_Commission|  by the resurrected Jesus.   The  |Gospel_of_Mark|Gospel_Of_Mark| , ascribed to  |Mark_the_Evangelist|Mark_The_Evangelist| . This gospel begins with the preaching of  |John_the_Baptist|John_The_Baptist|  and the  |baptism_of_Jesus|Baptism_Of_Jesus| . Two different secondary endings were affixed to this gospel in the 2nd century.   The  |Gospel_of_Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke| , ascribed to  |Luke_the_Evangelist|Luke_The_Evangelist| , who was not one of  |the_Twelve_Apostles|Twelve_Disciplesthe_Twelve_Apostles| , but was mentioned as a companion of the  |Apostle_Paul|Paul_Of_Tarsus|  and as a physician. Fitzmyer, Joseph A. . The Gospel according to Luke, Vol. 1. Anchor Bible Commentary series. New York: Doubleday. pp. 35–53. This gospel begins with parallel stories of the birth and childhood of  |John_the_Baptist|John_The_Baptist|  and  |Jesus|Jesus|  and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus and his ascension into heaven.   The  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John| , ascribed to  |John_the_Evangelist|John_The_Evangelist| . This gospel begins with a philosophical prologue and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus. It is about Jesuss miracles.     The first three gospels listed above are classified as the  |Synoptic_Gospels|Synoptic_Gospels| . They contain similar accounts of the events in Jesuss life and his teaching, due to their literary interdependence. The Gospel of John is structured differently and includes stories of several miracles of Jesus and sayings not found in the other three.     These four gospels that were eventually included in the New Testament were only a few among many other early Christian gospels. The existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke. Other early Christian gospels such as the so-called  |Jewish-Christian_Gospels|Jewish-Christian_Gospels|  or the  |Gospel_of_Thomas|Gospel_Of_Thomas| , also offer both a window into the context of  |early_Christianity|Early_Christianity|  and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the  |historical_Jesus|Historical_Jesus| .       The  |Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostles|  is a narrative of the apostles ministry and activity after  |Christs_death|Christs_Death|  and resurrection, from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the  |Gospel_of_Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke| . Examining style, phraseology, and other evidence, modern scholarship generally concludes that Acts and the Gospel of Luke share the same author, referred to as  |Luke–Acts|Luke–Acts| . Luke-Acts does not name its author. Church tradition identified him as  |Luke_the_Evangelist|Luke_The_Evangelist| , the companion of Paul, but the majority of scholars reject this due to the many differences between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters. The most probable date of composition is around 80–100 AD, although some scholars date it significantly later, and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.       The epistles of the New Testament are considered by Christians to be divinely inspired and holy letters, written by the apostles and disciples of Christ, to either local congregations with specific needs, or to  |New_Covenant|New_Covenant|  Christians in general, scattered about; or catholic epistles.          The Pauline letters to churches are the thirteen New Testament books that present  |Paul_the_Apostle|Paul_The_Apostle|  as their author. Six of the letters are disputed. Four are thought by most modern scholars to be  |pseudepigraphic|Pseudepigraphy| , i.e., not actually written by Paul even if attributed to him within the letters themselves. Opinion is more divided on the other two disputed letters .  |Bassler,_Jouette_M.|Jouette_Bassler|  . Paul and his Letters . In Aune, David E. The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 388. . These letters were written to Christian communities in specific cities or geographical regions, often to address issues faced by that particular community. Prominent themes include the relationship both to broader  |pagan|Gentile|  society, to Judaism, and to other Christians. Roetzel, Calvin J. . The Letters of Paul: Conversations in Context .

They include the following:    |First_Epistle_to_Timothy|First_Epistle_To_Timothy| |Second_Epistle_to_Timothy|Second_Epistle_To_Timothy| |Epistle_to_Titus|Epistle_To_Titus| |Epistle_to_Philemon|Epistle_To_Philemon|        All of the above except for Philemon are known as the  |Pastoral_epistles|Pastoral_Epistles| . They are addressed to individuals charged with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. They often address different concerns to those of the preceding epistles. These letters are believed by many to be pseudepigraphic. Some scholars will argue that the letters are genuinely Pauline, or at least written under Pauls supervision.       The  |Epistle_to_the_Hebrews|Epistle_To_The_Hebrews|  addresses a Jewish audience who had come to believe that Jesus was the  |anointed_one|Messiahjudaism|   who was predicted in the writings of the Hebrew Scriptures. The author discusses the superiority of the new covenant and the ministry of Jesus, to the  |Mosaic_covenant|Mosaic_Covenant|   and urges the readers in the practical implications of this conviction through the end of the epistle.     The book has been widely accepted by the Christian church as inspired by God and thus authoritative, despite the acknowledgment of uncertainties about who its human author was. Regarding authorship, although the Epistle to the Hebrews does not internally claim to have been written by the  |Apostle_Paul|Paul_Of_Tarsus| , some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline Epistles have been noted and inferred. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.  |Attridge,_Harold_W.|Harold_W._Attridge|  . Hebrews. Hermeneia. Philadelphia: Fortress. pp. 1–6.     In the 4th century,  |Jerome|Jerome|  and  |Augustine_of_Hippo|Augustine_Of_Hippo|  supported  |Pauls_authorship|Authorship_Of_The_Pauline_Epistles| . The Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the  |Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| . The letter to the Hebrews had difficulty in being accepted as part of the Christian canon because of its anonymity.  |Lane,_William_L.|William_L._Lane|  . Hebrews 1–8. Word Biblical Commentary series, Vol. 47A. Dallas, Texas: Word Books. p. cliv. As early as the 3rd century,  |Origen|Origen|  wrote of the letter, Men of old have handed it down as Pauls, but who wrote the Epistle God only knows.      Contemporary scholars often reject Pauline authorship for the epistle to the Hebrews, Ehrman, Bart D. . The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings. Oxford University Press. p. 323. Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing - Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul , and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee . Are there other books in the New Testament, though, that can be considered forgeries? based on its distinctive style and theology, which are considered to set it apart from Pauls writings.        The  |Catholic_epistles|Catholic_Epistles|  consist of both letters and treatises in the form of letters written to the church at large. The term  |catholic|Catholic|  , used to describe these letters in the oldest manuscripts containing them, here simply means general or universal . The authorship of a number of these is disputed.    |Epistle_of_James|Epistle_Of_James| , written by an author named James , often identified with  |James,_the_brother_of_Jesus|James_The_Just| .    |First_Epistle_of_Peter|First_Epistle_Of_Peter| , ascribed to the  |Apostle_Peter|Saint_Peter| .    |Second_Epistle_of_Peter|Second_Epistle_Of_Peter| , ascribed to the Apostle Peter, though widely considered not to have been written by him.

In the New Testament canon, it is considered  |prophetical|Bible_Prophecy|  or  |apocalyptic_literature|Apocalyptic_Literature| . Its authorship has been attributed either to John the Apostle  or to another John designated  |John_of_Patmos|John_Of_Patmos|  after the island where the text says the revelation was received .

The work opens with letters to  |seven_local_congregations_of_Asia_Minor|Seven_Churches_Of_Asia|  and thereafter takes the form of an  |apocalypse|Apocalypse| , a revealing of divine prophecy and mysteries, a literary genre popular in ancient Judaism and Christianity. For a detailed study of the Apocalypse of John, see Aune, David E. . Revelation, 3 volumes. Word Biblical Commentary series. Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson.                  ;Table notes           The order in which the books of the New Testament appear differs between some collections and ecclesiastical traditions. In the Latin West, prior to the  |Vulgate|Vulgate|  , the four Gospels were arranged in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark. The Syriac  |Peshitta|Peshitta|  places the major Catholic epistles immediately after Acts and before the Pauline epistles.     The order of an early edition of the letters of Paul is based on the size of the letters: longest to shortest, though keeping 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians together. The Pastoral epistles were apparently not part of the Corpus Paulinum in which this order originated and were later inserted after 2 Thessalonians and before Philemon. Hebrews was variously incorporated into the Corpus Paulinum either after 2 Thessalonians, after Philemon , or after Romans.     The New Testament of the 16th-century  |Luther_Bible|Luther_Bible|  continues, to this day, to place Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse last. This reflects the thoughts of the Reformer Martin Luther  |on_the_canonicity_of_these_books|Luthers_Canon| .            The books that eventually found a permanent place in the New Testament were not the only works of Christian literature produced in the earliest Christian centuries. The long process of  |canonization|Development_Of_The_New_Testament_Canon|  began early, sometimes with tacit reception of traditional texts, sometimes with explicit selection or rejection of particular texts as either acceptable or unacceptable for use in a given context .     Over the course of history, those works of early Christian literature that survived but that did not become part of the New Testament have been variously grouped by theologians and scholars. Drawing upon, though redefining, an older term used in  |early_Christianity|Early_Christianity|  and among Protestants when referring to those books found in the Christian  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament|  although not in the  |Jewish_Bible|Tanakh| , modern scholars began to refer to these works of early Christian literature not included in the New Testament as apocryphal , by which was meant non-canonical.     Collected editions of these works were then referred to as the  |New_Testament_apocrypha|New_Testament_Apocrypha|  . Typically excluded from such published collections are the following groups of works:  |The_Apostolic_Fathers|Apostolic_Fathers| , the 2nd-century Christian apologists,  |the_Alexandrians|Alexandrian_School| ,  |Tertullian|Tertullian| ,  |Methodius_of_Olympus|Methodius_Of_Olympus| ,  |Novatian|Novatian| ,  |Cyprian|Cyprian| , martyrdoms, and  |the_Desert_Fathers|Desert_Fathers| . Almost all other Christian literature from the period, and sometimes including works composed well into  |Late_Antiquity|Late_Antiquity| , are relegated to the so-called New Testament apocrypha.     Although not considered to be inspired by God, these apocryphal works were produced in the same ancient context and often using the same language as those books that would eventually form the New Testament. Some of these later works are dependent upon books that would later come to be in the New Testament or upon the ideas expressed in them. There is even an example of a  |pseudepigraph|Pseudepigraph| ical letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the Apostle Paul, the  |Epistle_to_the_Laodiceans|Epistle_To_The_Laodiceans| .          The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by  |Jewish_Christians|Jewish_Christians| —that is, Jewish disciples of Christ, who lived in the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , and under  |Roman_occupation|Judea| .  Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a  |Hellenistic_Jew|Hellenistic_Judaism| . Strelan, Rick . Luke the Priest: The Authority of the Author of the Third Gospel. Farnham, ENG: Routledege- |Ashgate|Ashgate_Publishing| . pp. 102–105. A few scholars identify the author of the Gospel of Mark as probably a Gentile, and similarly for the Gospel of Matthew, though most assert Jewish-Christian authorship. For discussion of Mark, see Schröter, Jens . Gospel of Mark . In Aune, David. The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament. New York: Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 281f.

According to the large majority of  |critical_scholars|Biblical_Criticism| , none of the authors of the Gospels were eyewitnesses or even explicitly claimed to be eyewitnesses.     |Bart_D._Ehrman|Bart_D._Ehrman|  of the  |University_of_North_Carolina|University_Of_North_Carolina|  has argued for a scholarly consensus that many New Testament books were not written by the individuals whose names are attached to them.

Traditionalists tend to support the idea that the writer of the Gospel of John himself claimed to be an eyewitness in their commentaries of  |John_21|John_21|   however, this idea is rejected by the majority of modern scholars.      Most scholars hold to the  |two-source_hypothesis|Two-Source_Hypothesis| , which posits that the  |Gospel_of_Mark_was_the_first_gospel_to_be_written|Marcan_Priority| . On this view, the authors of the  |Gospel_of_Matthew|Gospel_Of_Matthew|  and the  |Gospel_of_Luke|Gospel_Of_Luke|  used as sources the  |Gospel_of_Mark|Gospel_Of_Mark|  and a hypothetical  |Q_document|Q_Document|  to write their individual gospel accounts.   Easton, M. G. Luke, Gospel According To . Eastons Bible Dictionary. Oak Harbor, Washington: Logos Research.   These three gospels are called the  |Synoptic_Gospels|Synoptic_Gospels| , because they include many of the same stories, often in the same sequence, and sometimes in exactly the same wording. Scholars agree that the Gospel of John was written last, by using a different tradition and body of testimony. In addition, most scholars agree that the author of Luke also wrote the  |Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostles| . Scholars hold that these books constituted two halves of a single work,  |Luke-Acts|Luke-Acts| .     All four gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are  |anonymous_works|Anonymous_Work| .  The Gospel of John claims to be based on eyewitness testimony from the  |Disciple_whom_Jesus_loved|Disciple_Whom_Jesus_Loved| , but never names this character.           The Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles were both written by the same author, and are thus referred to as the Lucan texts. Horrell, D. G. . An Introduction to the Study of Paul. 2nd ed. London, ENG: Bloomsbury-T & T Clark. p. 7. Knox, W. L. . The Acts of the Apostles. pp. 2–15, for detailed arguments. The most direct evidence comes from the prefaces of each book; both were addressed to  |Theophilus|Theophilus| , and the preface to the Acts of the Apostles references my former book about the ministry of Jesus. Furthermore, there are linguistic and theological similarities between the two works, suggesting that they have a common author. Kenny, A. . A Stylometric Study of the New Testament.  |Schelle,_Udo|Udo_Schnelle| . The History and Theology of the New Testament Writings. p. 259. Bruce, F. F. . The Acts of the Apostles. p. 2.               The Pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the New Testament traditionally attributed to  |Paul_of_Tarsus|Paul_Of_Tarsus| . The anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is, despite unlikely Pauline authorship, often functionally grouped with these thirteen to form a corpus of fourteen Pauline epistles.     Seven letters are generally classified as undisputed , expressing contemporary scholarly near consensus that they are the work of Paul: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon. Six additional letters bearing Pauls name do not currently enjoy the same academic consensus: Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.     While many scholars uphold the traditional view, some question whether the first three, called the Deutero-Pauline Epistles , are authentic letters of Paul. As for the latter three, the Pastoral epistles , some scholars uphold the traditional view of these as the genuine writings of the Apostle Paul; most, however, regard them as  |pseudepigrapha|Pseudepigraphy| . Ehrman , p. 385.     One might refer to the  |Epistle_to_the_Laodiceans|Epistle_To_The_Laodiceans|  and the  |Third_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians|Third_Epistle_To_The_Corinthians|  as examples of works identified as pseudonymous. Since the early centuries of the church, there has been debate concerning the authorship of the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews, and contemporary scholars generally reject Pauline authorship.     The epistles all share common themes, emphasis, vocabulary and style; they exhibit a uniformity of doctrine concerning the  |Mosaic_Law|Ten_Commandments| , Jesus, faith, and various other issues. All of these letters easily fit into the chronology of Pauls journeys depicted in Acts of the Apostles.       The author of the  |Epistle_of_James|Epistle_Of_James|  identifies himself in the opening verse as James, a servant of  |God|God|  and of the Lord  |Jesus|Jesus|  Christ . From the middle of the 3rd century,  |patristic|Patristic|  authors cited the Epistle as written by  |James_the_Just|James_The_Just| . . 1914 Catholic Encyclopedia. Ancient and modern scholars have always been divided on the issue of authorship. Many consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries.      The author of the  |First_Epistle_of_Peter|First_Epistle_Of_Peter|  identifies himself in the opening verse as Peter, an  |apostle|Apostle|  of Jesus Christ , and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of  |Church_Fathers|Church_Fathers| |Irenaeus|Irenaeus|  ,  |Tertullian|Tertullian|  ,  |Clement_of_Alexandria|Clement_Of_Alexandria|  and  |Origen_of_Alexandria|Origen_Of_Alexandria|  . Unlike  |The_Second_Epistle_of_Peter|The_Second_Epistle_Of_Peter| , the authorship of which was debated in antiquity, there was little debate about Peters authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century. Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle, many biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author.

The  |First_Epistle_of_John|First_Epistle_Of_John|  is traditionally held to have been composed by  |John_the_Apostle|John_The_Apostle|   when the writer was in advanced age. The epistles content, language and conceptual style indicate that it may have had the same author as the Gospel of John, 2 John and 3 John.   |Eusebius|Eusebius|  claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not  |John_the_Apostle|John_The_Apostle| , but an elder John which refers either to the apostle at an advanced age or a hypothetical second individual . Eusebius. Chapter 39 . . Scholars today are divided on the issue.       The author of the  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation|  identifies himself several times as John . and states that he was on  |Patmos|Patmos|  when he received his first vision. As a result, the author is sometimes referred to as  |John_of_Patmos|John_Of_Patmos| . The author has traditionally been identified with  |John_the_Apostle|John_The_Apostle|  to whom the  |Gospel|Gospel_Of_John|  and the  |epistles_of_John|Epistles_Of_John|  were attributed. It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the  |Roman_emperor|Roman_Emperor| |Domitian|Domitian| , and there wrote Revelation.  |Justin_Martyr|Justin_Martyr|  who was acquainted with  |Polycarp|Polycarp| , who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source. Justin Martyr.  Dialogue with Trypho . Chapter LXXXI.  |Irenaeus|Irenaeus|  assumes it as a conceded point. According to the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, modern scholars are divided between the apostolic view and several alternative hypotheses put forth in the last hundred years or so.

These manuscripts place a clear  |upper_limit|Terminus_Post_Quem|  on the dating of New Testament texts. Explicit references to NT books in extra-biblical documents can push this upper limit down a bit further.  |Irenaeus|Irenaeus|  of Lyon names and quotes from most of the books in the New Testament in his book  |Against_Heresies|Against_Heresies| , written around 180 AD. The  |Epistle_of_Polycarp_to_the_Philippians|Epistle_Of_Polycarp_To_The_Philippians| , written some time between 110 and  |Polycarps_death|Polycarp|  in 155-167 AD, quotes or alludes to most New Testament texts. Biblical scholar  |David_Trobisch|David_Trobisch|  concludes in his survey of the evidence that no book of the New Testament could have been written later than 167 AD, the latest date for the martyrdom of  |Polycarp|Polycarp| .       Literary analysis of the New Testament texts themselves can be used to date many of the books of the New Testament to the mid- to late first century. The earliest works of the New Testament are the letters of the  |Apostle_Paul|Paul_The_Apostle| . It can be determined that  |1_Thessalonians|First_Epistle_To_The_Thessalonians|  is likely the earliest of these letters, written around 52 AD.  |Raymond_E._Brown|Raymond_E._Brown| , An Introduction to the New Testament,  |Anchor_Bible|Anchor_Bible| , 1997. pp. 456–466.          The major languages spoken by both Jews and Greeks in the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land|  at the  |time_of_Jesus|Cultural_And_Historical_Background_Of_Jesus|  were  |Aramaic|Aramaic_Of_Jesus|  and  |Koine_Greek|Koine_Greek| , and also a colloquial dialect of  |Mishnaic_Hebrew|Mishnaic_Hebrew| . It is generally agreed by most scholars that the  |historical_Jesus|Historical_Jesus|  primarily spoke  |Aramaic|Aramaic_Of_Jesus| ,  perhaps also some  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language|  and  |Koine_Greek|Koine_Greek| . The majority view is that all of the books that would eventually form the New Testament were written in the Koine Greek language. Metzger, Bruce M.; Ehrman, Bart D. .

D.; Allison, Dale C. . A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on The Gospel according to Saint Matthew, Vol. 1. Edinburgh: T & T Clark. pp. 33–58.          The process of canonization of the New Testament was complex and lengthy. In the initial centuries of  |early_Christianity|Early_Christianity| , there were many books widely considered by the church to be inspired, but there was no single formally recognized New Testament canon. Eusebius. Chapter 25 . . The process was characterized by a compilation of books that  |apostolic_tradition|Sacred_Tradition|  considered authoritative in worship and teaching, relevant to the historical situations in which they lived, and consonant with the Old Testament. Gamble, Harry Y. . The New Testament Canon: Its Making and Meaning. Guides to Biblical Scholarship. Philadelphia: Fortress. Writings attributed to the apostles circulated among the  |earliest_Christian_communities|Early_Centers_Of_Christianity|  and the Pauline epistles were circulating, perhaps in collected forms, by the end of the  |1st_century_AD|Christianity_In_The_1St_Century| . Three forms are postulated, from The Canon Debate, chapter 18, p. 300, note 21, attributed to Harry Y. Gamble: Marcions collection that begins with Galatians and ends with Philemon; Papyrus 46, dated about 200, that follows the order that became established except for reversing Ephesians and Galatians; and the letters to seven churches, treating those to the same church as one letter and basing the order on length, so that Corinthians is first and Colossians is last.     One of the earliest attempts at solidifying a canon was made by  |Marcion|Marcion| , circa 140 AD, who accepted only a modified version of Luke  and ten of Pauls letters, while rejecting the Old Testament entirely. His canon was largely rejected by other groups of Christians, notably the  |proto-orthodox_Christians|Proto-Orthodox_Christianity| , as was his theology,  |Marcionism|Marcionism| .  |Adolf_von_Harnack|Adolf_Von_Harnack| ,  John Knox,  and  |David_Trobisch|David_Trobisch| , among other scholars, have argued that the church formulated its New Testament canon partially in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.      |Polycarp|Polycarp| ,  |Epistle_of_Polycarp_to_the_Philippians|Epistle_Of_Polycarp_To_The_Philippians| ,   |Irenaeus|Irenaeus|   Against Heresies , inter alia, 3.12.12 and  |Tertullian|Tertullian|  Adversus Marcionem, inter alia, V.14 held the  |epistles_of_Paul|Pauline_Epistles|  to be divinely inspired scripture. Other books were held in high esteem but were gradually relegated to the status of  |New_Testament_apocrypha|New_Testament_Apocrypha| . Justin Martyr, in the mid  |2nd_century|Christianity_In_The_2Nd_Century| , mentions memoirs of the apostles as being read on Sunday alongside the  |writings_of_the_prophets|Neviim| . Justin Martyr. . Chapter 67.     The  |Muratorian_fragment|Muratorian_Fragment| , dated at between 170 and as late as the end of the 4th century , may be the earliest known New Testament canon attributed to mainstream Christianity. It is similar, but not identical, to the modern New Testament canon.     The oldest clear endorsement of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John being the only legitimate gospels was written circa 180 AD. A four gospel canon  was asserted by Irenaeus, who refers to it directly  Irenaeus. . Against Heresies, Book III. Section 8. in his  |polemic|Polemic|   Against Heresies    The books considered to be authoritative by Irenaeus included the four gospels and many of the letters of Paul, although, based on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the fourfold Gospel must have still been a novelty in Irenaeuss time.        By the early 200s,  |Origen|Origen|  may have been using the same twenty-seven books as in the Catholic New Testament canon, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of the Letter to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, II Peter, II John and III John and the Book of Revelation, Noll, Mark A. . Turning Points. Baker Academic. pp. 36–37. known as the  |Antilegomena|Antilegomena| . Likewise, the  |Muratorian_fragment|Muratorian_Fragment|  is evidence that, perhaps as early as 200, there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to the twenty-seven book NT canon, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them. de Jonge, H. J. . The New Testament Canon . In de Jonge, H. J.; Auwers, J. M . The Biblical Canons. Leuven University Press. p. 315. Thus, while there was a good measure of debate in the  |Early_Church|Early_Church|  over the New Testament canon, the major writings are claimed to have been accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the  |3rd_century|Christianity_In_The_3Rd_Century| .      Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information regarding the texts that became the New Testament. The information used to create the late-4th-century  |Easter_Letter|Easter_Letter| , which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the Ecclesiastical History of  |Eusebius_of_Caesarea|Eusebius_Of_Caesarea| , wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origens list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were then accepted and what were then  |disputed|Antilegomena| , by the  |third-century_churches_throughout_the_known_world|Early_Centers_Of_Christianity| , a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen. Bateman, C. G. . . Social Science Research Network.     In fact, Origen would have possibly included in his list of inspired writings other texts kept out by the likes of Eusebius—including the  |Epistle_of_Barnabas|Epistle_Of_Barnabas| ,  |Shepherd_of_Hermas|Shepherd_Of_Hermas| , and  |1_Clement|1_Clement| . Notwithstanding these facts, Origen is not the originator of the idea of biblical canon, but he certainly gives the philosophical and literary-interpretative underpinnings for the whole notion. McGuckin, John A. . Origen as Literary Critic in the Alexandrian Tradition . In Perrone, L. . Origeniana Octava: Origen and the Alexandrian Tradition, Vol. 1.

Leuven: Leuven University Press. pp. 121–37.        |Eusebius|Eusebius| , circa 300, gave a detailed list of New Testament writings in his Ecclesiastical History , Chapter XXV:   : 1... First then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Book of Revelation, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings.     : 3 Among the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name. Among the rejected writings must be reckoned also the  |Acts_of_Paul|Acts_Of_Paul| , and the so-called  |Shepherd|Shepherd_Of_Hermas| , and the  |Apocalypse_of_Peter|Apocalypse_Of_Peter| , and in addition to these the extant  |epistle_of_Barnabas|Epistle_Of_Barnabas| , and the so-called  |Teachings_of_the_Apostles|Didache| ; and besides, as I said, the  |Apocalypse_of_John|Book_Of_Revelation| , if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books. And among these some have placed also the  |Gospel_according_to_the_Hebrews|Gospel_Of_The_Hebrews| ... And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books.     : 6... such books as the  |Gospels_of_Peter|Gospel_Of_Peter| , of  |Thomas|Gospel_Of_Thomas| , of  |Matthias|Gospel_Of_Matthias| , or of any others besides them, and the  |Acts_of_Andrew|Acts_Of_Andrew|  and  |John|Acts_Of_John|  and the other apostles... they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of heretics. Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious.     The Book of Revelation is counted as both accepted and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the church fathers, it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: Pauls fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul. EH 4.29.6 mentions the  |Diatessaron|Diatessaron| |Athanasius|Athanasius| , Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon, and he used the word canonized  in regards to them. Brakke, David . Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandrias Thirty Ninth Festal Letter . Harvard Theological Review 87 : 395–419. The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the  |Synod_of_Hippo_Regius|Synod_Of_Hippo|  in North Africa ; the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the  |Council_of_Carthage|Council_Of_Carthage|  and the  |Council_of_Carthage|Council_Of_Carthage| .  Revelation was added later in 419 at the subsequent synod of Carthage. These councils were under the authority of  |St._Augustine|Augustine_Of_Hippo| , who regarded the canon as already closed.   Augustine. De Civitate Dei. 22.8.      |Pope_Damasus_Is|Pope_Damasus_I| |Council_of_Rome|Council_Of_Rome|  in 382, if the  Decretum Gelasianum  is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above, or, if not, the list is at least a 6th-century compilation.  Likewise, Damasus commissioning of the Latin  |Vulgate|Vulgate|  edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.  In c. 405,  |Pope_Innocent_I|Pope_Innocent_I|  sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop,  |Exsuperius_of_Toulouse|Exuperius| . Christian scholars assert that, when these  |bishops|Bishops|  and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new but instead were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church.       The New Testament canon as it is now was first listed by  |St._Athanasius,_Bishop_of_Alexandria|Athanasius_Of_Alexandria| , in 367, in a letter written to his churches in Egypt, . Also cited is the  |Council_of_Rome|Council_Of_Rome| , but not without controversy. That canon gained wider and wider recognition until it was accepted at the  |Third_Council_of_Carthage|Third_Council_Of_Carthage|  in 397 and 419.     Even this council did not settle the matter, however. Certain books, referred to as  |Antilegomena|Antilegomena| , continued to be questioned, especially  |James|Epistle_Of_James|  and  |Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation| . Even as late as the 16th century, the Reformer  |Martin_Luther|Martin_Luther|  questioned the  |Epistle_of_James|Epistle_Of_James| , the  |Epistle_of_Jude|Epistle_Of_Jude| , the  |Epistle_to_the_Hebrews|Epistle_To_The_Hebrews|  and the  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation| . To this day, German-language  |Luther_Bibles|Luther_Bible|  are printed with these four books at the end of the canon, rather than in their traditional order as in other editions of the Bible.     In light of this questioning of the canon of Scripture by Protestants in the 16th century, the  |Council_of_Trent|Council_Of_Trent|  reaffirmed the traditional western canon , thus making the  |Canon_of_Trent|Canon_Of_Trent|  and the  |Vulgate|Vulgate|  Bible  |dogma|Roman_Catholic_Dogma|  in the Catholic Church. Later,  |Pope_Pius_XI|Pope_Pius_Xi|  on 2 June 1927 decreed the  |Comma_Johanneum|Comma_Johanneum|  was open to dispute and  |Pope_Pius_XII|Pope_Pius_Xii|  on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical  Divino afflante Spiritu , which allowed translations based on other versions than just the Latin  |Vulgate|Vulgate| , notably in English the  |New_American_Bible|New_American_Bible| .     Thus, some claim that, from the  |4th_century|Christianity_In_The_4Th_Centurydefining_Scripture| , there existed unanimity in the  |West|Western_Church|  concerning the New Testament canon ,  and that, by the  |5th_century|Christianity_In_The_5Th_Century| , the  |Eastern_Church|Eastern_Church| , with a few exceptions, had come to accept the  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation|  and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.  Nonetheless, full dogmatic articulations of the canon were not made until the  |Canon_of_Trent|Canon_Of_Trent|  of 1546 for  |Roman_Catholicism|Roman_Catholicism| , the  |Thirty-Nine_Articles|Thirty-Nine_Articles|  of 1563 for the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , the  |Westminster_Confession_of_Faith|Westminster_Confession_Of_Faith|  of 1647 for  |Calvinism|Calvinism| , and the  |Synod_of_Jerusalem|Synod_Of_Jerusalem|  of 1672 for the  |Greek_Orthodox|Greek_Orthodox| .     On the question of NT Canon formation generally, New Testament scholar Lee Martin McDonald has written that: McDonald, Lee M. . The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson. p. 116.        Christian scholars assert that when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, they were not defining something new, but instead were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church .     Some synods of the 4th century published lists of canonical books . The existing 27-book canon of the New Testament was reconfirmed  in the 16th century with the  |Council_of_Trent|Council_Of_Trent|  of 1546,  Finally on 8 April 1546, by a vote of 24 to 15, with 16 abstensions, the Council issued a decree  in which, for the first time in the history of the church, the question of the contents of the Bible was made an absolute article of faith and confirmed by an anathema. the  |Thirty-Nine_Articles|Thirty-Nine_Articles|  of 1563 for the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , the  |Westminster_Confession_of_Faith|Westminster_Confession_Of_Faith|  of 1647 for  |Calvinism|Calvinism| , and the  |Synod_of_Jerusalem|Synod_Of_Jerusalem|  of 1672 for  |Eastern_Orthodoxy|Eastern_Orthodoxy| . Although these councils did include statements about the canon, when it came to the New Testament they were only reaffirming the existing canon, including the  |Antilegomena|Antilegomena| .     According to the  Catholic Encyclopedia  article on the Canon of the New Testament: The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the  |Tridentine_Council|Council_Of_Trent| .      In 331,  |Constantine_I|Constantine_I_And_Christianity|  commissioned Eusebius to deliver  |fifty_Bibles|Fifty_Bibles_Of_Constantine|  for the  |Church_of_Constantinople|Church_Of_Constantinople| .  |Athanasius|Athanasius|   recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for  |Constans|Constans| . Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that  |Codex_Vaticanus|Codex_Vaticanus_Graecus_1209|  and  |Codex_Sinaiticus|Codex_Sinaiticus|  may be examples of these Bibles. Together with the  |Peshitta|Peshitta|  and  |Codex_Alexandrinus|Codex_Alexandrinus| , these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.  There is no evidence among the  |canons_of_the_First_Council_of_Nicaea_of_any_determination_on_the_canon|First_Council_Of_Nicaeathe_Biblical_Canon| .                  Like other literature from  |antiquity|Classical_Antiquity| , the text of the New Testament was  preserved and transmitted in  |manuscripts|Manuscripts| . Manuscripts containing at least a part of the New Testament number in the thousands. The earliest of these are often very fragmentarily preserved. Some of these fragments have even been thought to date as early as the 2nd century . For the initial dating of P52, see Roberts, C. H. . An Unpublished Fragment of the Fourth Gospel in the John Rylands Library. Manchester: Manchester University Press; and Bell, H. Idris; Skeat, T. C. . Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and Other Early Christian Papyri. London: Trustees of the British Museum. Though see now Nongbri, Brent . The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel . Harvard Theological Review 98The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 590–623.     For each subsequent century, more and more manuscripts survive that contain a portion or all of the books that were held to be part of the New Testament at that time , though occasionally these manuscripts contain other works as well . The date when a manuscript was written, however, does not necessarily reflect the date of the form of text it contains. That is, later manuscripts can, and occasionally do, contain older forms of text or older readings.     Some of the more important manuscripts containing an early text of books of the New Testament are:     The  |Chester_Beatty_Papyri|Chester_Beatty_Papyri|    The  |Bodmer_Papyri|Bodmer_Papyri| |Codex_Bobiensis|Codex_Bobiensis| |Uncial_0171|Uncial_0171| |Syriac_Sinaiticus|Syriac_Sinaiticus| |Schøyen_Manuscript|Schoyen_Collection|  2560    |Codex_Vaticanus|Codex_Vaticanus| |Codex_Sinaiticus|Codex_Sinaiticus| |Codex_Vercellensis|Codex_Vercellensis| |Curetonian_Gospels|Curetonian_Gospels| |Garima_Gospels|Garima_Gospels| |Textual_criticism|Textual_Criticism|  deals with the identification and removal of  |transcription|Transcription|  errors in the  |texts|Writing|  of  |manuscripts|Manuscripts| . Ancient  |scribes|Scribes|  made errors or alterations .  The New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800  |Greek|Greek_Language|  manuscripts, 10,000  |Latin|Latin|  manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including  |Syriac|Syriac_Language| ,  |Slavic|Slavic_Languages| ,  |Ethiopic|Ethiopic|  and  |Armenian|Armenian_Language| . Even if the  |original_Greek|Greek_New_Testament|  versions were lost, the entire New Testament could still be assembled from the translations. Strobel, Lee . The Case for Christ. Chapter Three, when quoting biblical scholar  |Bruce_Metzger|Bruce_Metzger| .     In addition, there are so many quotes from the New Testament in early church documents and commentaries that the entire New Testament could also be assembled from these alone. Not all biblical manuscripts come from orthodox Christian writers. For example, the  |Gnostic|Gnostic|  writings of  |Valentinus|Valentinus|  come from the 2nd century AD, and these Christians were regarded as heretics by the mainstream church.  The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, but it also gives scholars a better idea of how close modern Bibles are to the original versions.     On noting the large number of surviving ancient manuscripts,  |Bruce_Metzger|Bruce_Metzger|  sums up the view on the issue by saying The more often you have copies that agree with each other, especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original document was like. The only way theyd agree would be where they went back genealogically in a family tree that represents the descent of the manuscripts.       In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as additions of material, centuries after the gospel was written. These are called  |interpolations|Interpolation| . In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. According to  |Bart_D._Ehrman|Bart_D._Ehrman| , These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries.      Most modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate passages that have disputed source documents. Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail. While many variations have been discovered between early copies of biblical texts, almost all have no importance, as they are variations in spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Also, many of these variants are so particular to the Greek language that they would not appear in translations into other languages. For example, order of words often does not matter in Greek, so textual variants that flip the order of words often have no consequences.     Outside of these unimportant variants, there are a couple variants of some importance. The two most commonly cited examples are the  |last_verses|Mark_16|  of the Gospel of Mark Nave, Guy D.

Many scholars and critics also believe that the  |Comma_Johanneum|Comma_Johanneum|  reference supporting the  |Trinity|Trinity|  doctrine in  |1_John|1_John|  to have been a later addition. Ehrman , p. 166.  According to  |Norman_Geisler|Norman_Geisler|  and William Nix, The New Testament, then, has not only survived in more manuscripts than any other book from antiquity, but it has survived in a purer form than any other great book—a form that is 99.5% pure           The often referred to Interpreters Dictionary of the Bible, a book written to prove the validity of the New Testament, says: A study of 150 Greek of the Gospel of Luke has revealed more than 30,000 different readings... It is safe to say that there is not one sentence in the New Testament in which the is wholly uniform. Parvis, M. M. Vol. 4. pp. 594–595. Most of the variation took place within the first three Christian centuries.       By the 4th century, textual families or types of text become discernible among  |New_Testament_manuscripts|Biblical_Manuscript| . A text-type is the name given to a family of texts with similar readings due to common ancestors and mutual correction. Many early manuscripts, however, contain individual readings from several different earlier forms of text. Modern texual critics have identified the following text-types among textual witnesses to the New Testament: The  |Alexandrian_text-type|Alexandrian_Text-Type|  is usually considered to generally preserve many early readings. It is represented, e.g., by  |Codex_Vaticanus|Codex_Vaticanus_Graecus_1209| ,  |Codex_Sinaiticus|Codex_Sinaiticus|  and the  |Bodmer_Papyri|Bodmer_Papyri| .     The  |Western_text-type|Western_Text-Type|  is generally longer and can be paraphrastic, but can also preserve early readings. The  |Western_version_of_the_Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostlesmanuscripts|  is, notably, 8.5% longer than the Alexandrian form of the text. Examples of the Western text are found in  |Codex_Bezae|Codex_Bezae| ,  |Codex_Claromontanus|Codex_Claromontanus| ,  |Codex_Washingtonianus|Codex_Washingtonianus| , the  |Old_Latin|Vetus_Latina|  , as well as in quotations by  |Marcion|Marcion| ,  |Tatian|Tatian| ,  |Irenaeus|Irenaeus| ,  |Tertullian|Tertullian|  and  |Cyprian|Cyprian| .     A text-type referred to as the  |Caesarean_text-type|Caesarean_Text-Type|  and thought to have included witnesses such as  |Codex_Koridethi|Codex_Koridethi|  and minuscule 565, can today be described neither as Caesarean nor as a text-type as was previously thought. However, the Gospel of Mark in  |Papyrus_45|Papyrus_45| ,  |Codex_Washingtonianus|Codex_Washingtonianus|  and in  |Family_13|Family_13|  does indeed reflect a distinct type of text.     Increasing standardization of distinct text-types eventually gave rise to the  |Byzantine_text-type|Byzantine_Text-Type| . Since most manuscripts of the New Testament do not derive from the first several centuries, that is, they were copied after the rise of the Byzantine text-type, this form of text is found the majority of extant manuscripts and is therefore often called the Majority Text. As with all of the other text-types, the Byzantine can also occasionally preserve early readings.           |Biblical_criticism|Biblical_Criticism|  is the scholarly study and investigation of  |biblical_writings|Biblical_Manuscript|  that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings. Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey.     It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament| , the letters of the New Testament, or the  |Canonical_Gospels|Canonical_Gospels| . It also plays an important role in the quest for the  |historical_Jesus|Historical_Jesus| . It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history, and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including  |archaeology|Archaeology| ,  |anthropology|Anthropology| ,  |folklore|Folklore| ,  |linguistics|Linguistics| ,  |Oral_Tradition_studies|Christian_Oral_Tradition| , history, and  |religious_studies|Religious_Studies| .          The  |textual_variation|Textual_Variation|  among manuscript copies of books in the New Testament prompted attempts to discern the earliest form of text already in antiquity . The efforts began in earnest again during the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| , which saw a revival of the study of ancient Greek texts. During this period, modern  |textual_criticism|Textual_Criticism|  was born. In this context,  |Christian_humanists|Christian_Humanism|  such as  |Lorenzo_Valla|Lorenzo_Valla|  and  |Erasmus|Erasmus|  promoted a return to the original Greek of the New Testament. This was the beginning of modern  |New_Testament_textual_criticism|New_Testament_Textual_Criticism| , which over subsequent centuries would increasingly incorporate more and more manuscripts, in more languages , as well as citations of the New Testament by ancient authors and the New Testament text in  |lectionaries|Lectionary|  in order to reconstruct the earliest recoverable form of the New Testament text and the history of changes to it.  |Metzger,_Bruce_M.|Bruce_M._Metzger| ;  |Ehrman,_Bart_D.|Bart_D._Ehrman|  . The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.          Books that later formed the New Testament, like other Christian literature of the period, originated in a literary context that reveals relationships not only to other Christian writings, but also to  |Graeco-Roman|Classics|  and  |Jewish|Judaismantiquity|  works. Of singular importance is the extensive use of and interaction with the  |Jewish_Bible|Tanakh|  and what would become the  |Christian_Old_Testament|Old_Testament| . Both implicit and explicit citations, as well as countless allusions, appear throughout the books of the New Testament, from the Gospels and Acts, to the Epistles, to the Apocalypse. See, e.g., Stendahl, Krister . The School of St. Matthew and Its Use of the Old Testament. Uppsala and Lund; Marcus, Joel .

London: SCM.       The first translations of the New Testament were made beginning already at the end of 2nd century. The earliest versions of the New Testament are the translations into the  |Syriac|Syriac_Language| ,  |Latin|Latin| , and  |Coptic|Coptic_Language|  languages.  |Võõbus,_Arthur|Arthur_Võõbus|  . Early Versions of the New Testament. Stockholm. pp. 1–128, 211–240. These three versions were made directly from the Greek, and are frequently cited in the apparatuses of modern critical editions.             Syriac was spoken in  |Syria|Syria| , and  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| , and with dialect in  |Roman|Syria_Palaestina|  and  |Byzantine_Palestine|Palaestina_Secunda|  where it was known as  |Jewish_Palestinian_Aramaic|Jewish_Palestinian_Aramaic| . Several Syriac translations were made and have come to us. Most of the Old Syriac, however, as well as the Philoxonian version have been lost.      |Tatian|Tatian| , the Assyrian, created the  |Diatessaron|Diatessaron| , a  |gospel_harmony|Gospel_Harmony|  written in Syriac around 170 AD and the earliest form of the gospel not only in Syriac but probably also in Armenian.     In the 19th century, manuscript evidence was discovered for an Old Syriac version of the four distinct gospels. These separated  gospels, though old, have been shown to be later than the Diatessaron. The Old Syriac gospels are fragmentarily preserved in two manuscripts: the 5th-century  |Curetonian_Syriac|Curetonian_Gospels|  and the  |Sinaitic_Syriac|Syriac_Sinaiticus|  from the 4th or 5th century.     No Old Syriac manuscripts of other portions of the New Testament survive, though Old Syriac readings, e.g. from the  |Pauline_Epistles|Pauline_Epistles| , can be discerned in citations made by Eastern fathers and in later Syriac versions. The Old Syriac version is a representative of the  |Western_text-type|Western_Text-Type| . The  |Peshitta|Peshitta|  version was prepared in the beginning of the 5th century. It contains only 22 books .     The  |Philoxenian|Philoxenian|  probably was produced in 508 for  |Philoxenus,_Bishop_of_Mabung|Philoxenus,_Bishop_Of_Mabung| .           The Gospels were likely translated into Latin as early as the last quarter of the 2nd century in North Africa . Not much later, there were also European Latin translations . There are about 80 Old Latin mansucripts. The  |Vetus_Latina|Vetus_Latina|  versions often contain readings with a Western type of text.      The bewildering diversity of the Old Latin versions prompted  |Jerome|Jerome|  to prepare another translation into Latin—the  |Vulgate|Vulgate| . In many respects it was merely a revision of the Old Latin. There are currently around 8,000 manuscripts of the Vulgate.          There are several dialects of the Coptic language:  |Bohairic|Bohairic|  ,  |Fayyumic|Fayyumic| ,  |Sahidic|Sahidic|  ,  |Akhmimic|Akhmimic| , and others. The first translation was made by at least the 3rd century into the Sahidic dialect . This translation represents a mixed text, mostly  |Alexandrian|Alexandrian_Text-Type| , though also with  |Western|Western_Text-Type|  readings.      A Bohairic translation was made later, but existed already in the 4th century. Though the translation makes less use of Greek words than the Sahidic, it does employ some Greek grammar . For this reason, the Bohairic translation can be helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text of the New Testament. ;           The continued spread of Christianity, and the foundation of national churches, led to the translation of the Bible—often beginning with books from the New Testament—into a variety of other languages at a relatively early date:  |Armenian|Bible_Translations_Into_Armenian| ,  |Georgian|Bible_Translations_Into_Georgian| ,  |Ethiopic|Ethiopic| ,  |Persian|Bible_Translations_Into_Persian| ,  |Sogdian|Bible_Translations_Into_Sogdian| , and eventually  |Gothic|Gothic_Bible| ,  |Old_Church_Slavonic|Bible_Translations_Into_Church_Slavonic| ,  |Arabic|Bible_Translations_Into_Arabic| , and  |Nubian|Bible_Translations_Into_Nubian| . On the Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Gothic, see             Historically, throughout the  |Christian_world|Christendom|  and in the context of  |Christian_missionary_activity|Mission| , the New Testament has been that part of the Christian Bible first translated into the  |vernacular|Vernacular| . The production of such translations grew out of the insertion of  |vernacular|Vernacular| |glosses|Gloss|  in biblical texts, as well as out of the production of  |biblical_paraphrases|Biblical_Paraphrase|  and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ .     The 16th century saw the rise of  |Protestantism|Protestantism|  and an explosion of translations of the New Testament into the  |vernacular|Vernacular| . Notable are those of  |Martin_Luther|Luther_Bible|  ,  |Jacques_Lefèvre_dÉtaples|Jacques_Lefèvre_Détaples|  , the  |Froschau_Bible|Zürich_Bible|  ,  |William_Tyndale|Tyndale_Bible|  , the  |Brest_Bible|Brest_Bible|  , and the  |Authorized_Version|Authorized_King_James_Version|  .     Most of these translations relied upon one of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament edited by  |Erasmus|Erasmus| , a form of this Greek text emerged as the standard and is known as the  |Textus_Receptus|Textus_Receptus| . This text, based on the majority of manuscripts is also used in the majority of translations that were made in the years 100 to 400 AD.     Translations of the New Testament made since the appearance of critical editions of the Greek text  have largely used them as their  |base_text|Source_Text| . Unlike the  |Textus_Receptus|Textus_Receptus| , these have a pronounced Alexandrian character. Standard critical editions are those of  |Souter|Alexander_Souter| , Vogels, Bover, Merk, and  |Nestlé-Aland|Novum_Testamentum_Graece|  .     Notable translations of the New Testament based on these most recent critical editions include the  |Revised_Standard_Version|Revised_Standard_Version|  ,  |La_Bible_de_Jérusalem|:Fr:La_Bible_De_Jérusalem|  , the  |Einheitsübersetzung|Einheitsübersetzung|  , the  |New_American_Bible|New_American_Bible|  , the  |Traduction_Oecuménique_de_la_Bible|Traduction_Oecuménique_De_La_Bible|  , and the  |New_Revised_Standard_Version|New_Revised_Standard_Version|  .          Though all Christian churches accept the New Testament as scripture, they differ in their understanding of the nature, extent, and relevance of its authority. Views of the authoritativeness of the New Testament often depend on the concept of  inspiration , which relates to the role of God in the formation of the New Testament. Generally, the greater the role of God in ones doctrine of inspiration, the more one accepts the  |doctrine|Doctrine|  of  |biblical_inerrancy|Biblical_Inerrancy|  or authoritativeness of the Bible. One possible source of confusion is that these terms are difficult to define, because many people use them interchangeably or with very different meanings. This article will use the terms in the following manner:   Infallibility relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in matters of doctrine.   Inerrancy relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in factual assertions .   Authoritativeness relates to the correctness of the Bible in questions of practice in morality.          All of these concepts depend for their meaning on the supposition that the text of Bible has been properly interpreted, with consideration for the intention of the text, whether  |literal|Literal_And_Figurative_Language|  history,  |allegory|Allegory|  or poetry, etc. Especially the doctrine of inerrancy is variously understood according to the weight given by the interpreter to scientific investigations of the world.       The notion of unity in diversity of Scripture claims that the Bible presents a noncontradictory and consistent message concerning God and redemptive history. The fact of diversity is observed in comparing the diversity of time, culture, authors perspectives, literary genre, and the theological themes.     Studies from many theologians considering the unity in diversity to be found in the New Testament have been collected and summarized by New Testament theologian  |Frank_Stagg|Frank_Stagg| . He describes them as some basic presuppositions, tenets, and concerns common among the New Testament writers, giving to the New Testament its unity in diversity :   The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed   Jesus Christ is absolutely central: he is Lord and Savior, the foretold Prophet, the Messianic King, the Chosen, the way, the truth, and the light, the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came   The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ.   The Christian faith and life are a calling, rooted in divine election.   The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God   Salvation is both Gods gift and his demand through Jesus Christ, to be received by faith   The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center   God creates a people of his own, designated and described by varied terminology and analogies   History must be understood eschatologically, being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God, already present in Christ, is brought to its complete triumph   In Christ, all of Gods work of creation, revelation, and redemption is brought to fulfillment Stagg, Frank . New Testament Theology. Broadman. .       For the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| , there are two modes of Revelation: Scripture and  |Tradition|Apostolic_Tradition| . Both of them are interpreted by the teachings of the Church. The Roman Catholic view is expressed clearly in the  |Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church|Catechism_Of_The_Catholic_Church|  :     § 82: As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.     § 107: The inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.   In Catholic terminology the teaching office is called the  |Magisterium|Magisterium| . The Catholic view should not be confused with the two-source theory. As the Catechism states in §§ 80 and 81, Revelation has one common source ... two distinct modes of transmission. . Catechism of the Catholic Church. 2nd ed. 1997.     While many  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  writers distinguish between Scripture and Tradition, Bishop Kallistos Ware says that for the Orthodox there is only one source of the Christian faith, Holy Tradition, within which Scripture exists. Ware, Kallistos . .The Orthodox Church. Penguin UK.     Traditional  |Anglicans|Anglican_Communion|  believe that Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation , , but also that the Catholic Creeds ought thoroughly to be received and believed , and that the Church hath authority in Controversies of Faith and is a witness and keeper of Holy Writ .  Classical Anglicanism, therefore, like Orthodoxy, holds that Holy Tradition is the only safe guardian against perversion and innovation in the interpretation of Scripture.     In the famous words of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells: As for my religion, I dye in the holy catholic and apostolic faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West, more particularly in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all Papal and Puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the Cross.       Following the doctrine of  |sola_scriptura|Sola_Scriptura| , Protestants believe that their traditions of faith, practice and interpretations carry forward what the scriptures teach, and so tradition is not a source of authority in itself. Their traditions derive authority from the Bible, and are therefore always open to reëvaluation. This openness to doctrinal revision has extended in  |Liberal|Liberal_Christianity|  Protestant traditions even to the reevaluation of the doctrine of Scripture upon which the Reformation was founded, and members of these traditions may even question whether the Bible is infallible in doctrine, inerrant in historical and other factual statements, and whether it has uniquely divine authority. However, the adjustments made by modern  |Protestants|Protestantism|  to their doctrine of scripture vary widely.       Within the US, the  |Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy|Chicago_Statement_On_Biblical_Inerrancy|  is a statement, articulating evangelical views on this issue. Paragraph four of its summary states: Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about Gods acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to Gods saving grace in individual lives.         |Mainline|Mainline|  American  |Protestant|Protestant|  denominations, including the  |United_Methodist_Church|United_Methodist_Church| ,  |Presbyterian_Church_USA|Presbyterian_Church_Usa| ,  |The_Episcopal_Church|Episcopal_Church_In_The_United_States_Of_America| , and  |Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America|Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_In_America| , do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement. All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture, but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching—from evangelicalism to skepticism. It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors, or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that, however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors time, moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly.     For example,  |ordination_of_women|Ordination_Of_Women|  is universally accepted in the mainline churches,  |abortion|Abortion|  is condemned as a grievous social tragedy but not always a personal  |sin|Sin|  or a crime against an unborn person, and  |homosexuality|Homosexuality|  is sometimes recognized as a genetic propensity or morally neutral preference that should be neither encouraged nor condemned. In North America, the most contentious of these issues among these churches at the present time is how far the ordination of gay men and lesbians should be accepted.     Officials of the Presbyterian Church USA report: We acknowledge the role of scriptural authority in the Presbyterian Church, but Presbyterians generally do not believe in biblical inerrancy. Presbyterians do not insist that every detail of chronology or sequence or prescientific description in scripture be true in literal form. Our confessions do teach biblical infallibility. Infallibility affirms the entire truthfulness of scripture without depending on every exact detail. Homosexual ordination vote widens gap between Presbyterian factions . ReligionToday. 20 June 2001.     Those who hold a more liberal view of the Bible as a human witness to the glory of God, the work of fallible humans who wrote from a limited experience unusual only for the insight they have gained through their inspired struggle to know God in the midst of a troubled world. Therefore, they tend not to accept such doctrines as inerrancy. These churches also tend to retain the social activism of their evangelical forebears of the 19th century, placing particular emphasis on those teachings of scripture that teach compassion for the poor and concern for  |social_justice|Social_Justice| .     The message of personal  |salvation|Salvation|  is, generally speaking, of the good that comes to oneself and the world through following the New Testaments  |Golden_Rule|Ethic_Of_Reciprocity|  admonition to love others without hypocrisy or prejudice. Toward these ends, the spirit of the New Testament, more than the letter, is infallible and authoritative.     There are some movements that believe the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus but who reject the churches that were formed following its publication. These people believe all individuals can communicate directly with God and therefore do not need guidance or doctrines from a church. These people are known as  |Christian_anarchists|Christian_Anarchism| .        |Messianic_Judaism|Messianic_Judaism|  generally holds the same view of New Testament authority as evangelical Protestants.    According to the view of some Messianic Jewish congregations, Jesus did not annul the Torah, but that its interpretation is revised and ultimately explained through the Apostolic Scriptures.         |Jehovahs_Witnesses|Jehovahs_Witnesses|  accept the New Testament as divinely inspired Scripture, and as infallible in every detail, with equal authority as the Hebrew Scriptures. They view it as the written revelation and good news of the  |Messiah|Messiah| , the  |ransom_sacrifice_of_Jesus|Atonement_In_Christianity| , and the  |Kingdom_of_God|Kingdom_Of_God| , explaining and expounding the Hebrew Bible, not replacing but vitally supplementing it. They also view the New Testament as the primary instruction guide for Christian living, and  |church_discipline|Church_Discipline| . They generally call the New Testament the Christian Greek Scriptures , and see only the covenants as old or new , but not any part of the actual Scriptures themselves. Equipped For Every Good Work .

Retrieved 15 April 2013. They regard the New Testament as perfect and inerrant in every way, revealing the Lord Jesus Christ in the Flesh, and his Atonement, and which also explains and illuminates the Old Testament perfectly, and is part of the Bible canon, not because church councils or decrees claimed it so, but by witness of the Holy Spirit.

The  |Seventh-day_Adventist_Church|Seventh-Day_Adventist_Church|  holds the New Testament as the inspired Word of God, with God influencing the thoughts of the Apostles in the writing, not necessarily every word though. The first fundamental belief of the Seventh-Day Adventist church stated that The Holy Scriptures are the  |infallible|Biblical_Infallibility|  revelation of will.  |Adventist_theologians|Seventh-Day_Adventist_Theology|  generally reject the verbal inspiration position on Scripture held by many conservative  |evangelical_Christians|Evangelical_Christians| . They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors and apostles, and that the writers then expressed these thoughts in their own words.  This view is popularly known as thought inspiration , and most Adventist members hold to that view. According to Ed Christian, former  JATS  editor, few if any  |ATS|Adventist_Theological_Society|  members believe in verbal inerrancy .      Regarding the teachings of the New Testament compared to the Old, and the application in the New Covenant, Adventists have traditionally taught that the  |Decalogue|Ethical_Decalogue|  is part of the moral law of God, which was not abrogated by the ministry and death of  |Jesus_Christ|Jesus_Christ| . Therefore, the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath is as applicable to Christian believers as the other nine. Adventists have often taught a distinction between moral law and ceremonial law . According to Adventist beliefs, the moral law continues into the New Testament era , but the ceremonial law was done away with by Jesus.     How the  |Mosaic_law|Mosaic_Law|  should be applied came up at Adventist conferences in the past, and Adventist theologians such as  |A._T._Jones|A._T._Jones|  and  |E._J._Waggoner|E._J._Waggoner|  looked at the problem addressed by Paul in  |Galatians|Epistle_To_The_Galatians|  as not the ceremonial law, but rather the wrong use of the law . They were opposed by  |Uriah_Smith|Uriah_Smith|  and  |George_Butler|George_Ide_Butler|  at the 1888 Conference. Smith in particular thought the Galatians issue had been settled by Ellen White already, yet in 1890 she claimed justification by faith is the  |third_angels_message|Three_Angels_Messages|  in verity.      Ellen White interpreted  as saying that the ceremonial law was nailed to the cross. White, Ellen . . Start Publishing LLC. p. 365.       Members of  |The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|The_Church_Of_Jesus_Christ_Of_Latter-Day_Saints|  believe that the New Testament, as part of the  |Christian_biblical_canon|Christian_Biblical_Canons| , is accurate as far as it is translated correctly .  They believe the Bible as originally revealed is the word of God, but that the processes of transcription and translation have introduced errors into the texts as currently available, and therefore they cannot be regarded as completely inerrant.   In addition to the Old and New Testaments, the  |Book_of_Mormon|Book_Of_Mormon:_Another_Testament_Of_Jesus_Christ| , the  |Doctrine_and_Covenants|Doctrine_And_Covenants|  and the  |Pearl_of_Great_Price|Pearl_Of_Great_Price|  are considered part of their scriptural canon. Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Macmillan 1992, pp. 106–107         Despite the wide variety among  |Christian_liturgies|Christian_Liturgy| , texts from the New Testament play a role in almost all forms of  |Christian_worship|Christian_Worship| . In addition to some language derived from the New Testament in the  |liturgy|Liturgy|  itself , the reading of extended passages from the New Testament is a practice common to almost all  |Christian_worship|Christian_Worship| , liturgical or not.     These  |readings|Lection|  are most often part of an established  |lectionary|Lectionary|  , and  include a non-gospel reading from the New Testament and culminate with a  |Gospel_reading|Gospel| .

Literary expansion of the  |Nativity_of_Jesus|Nativity_Of_Jesus|  found in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke began already in the 2nd century, and the portrayal of the Nativity has continued in various art forms to this day. The  |earliest_Christian_art|Early_Christian_Art|  would often depict scenes from the New Testament such as the  |raising_of_Lazarus|Raising_Of_Lazarus| , the  |baptism_of_Jesus|Baptism_Of_Jesus|  or the motif of the  |Good_Shepherd|Good_Shepherd| .      |Biblical_paraphrases|Biblical_Paraphrase|  and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ  became popular in the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , as did the portrayal of the  |arrest|Arrest_Of_Jesus| ,  |trial|Trial_Of_Jesus|  and  |execution|Crucifixion_Of_Jesus|  of Jesus in  |Passion_plays|Passion_Play| .
