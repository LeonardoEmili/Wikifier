        The Andes or Andean Mountains  are the  |longest|List_Of_Mountain_Rangesby_Length| |_continental|Continental_Crust| |_mountain_range|Mountain_Range|  in the world, forming a continuous highland along the western edge of South America. The Andes also have the 2nd most elevated highest peak of any mountain range, only behind the  |Himalayas|Himalayas| . The range is  long,  wide , and has an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries:  |Venezuela|Venezuela| ,  |Colombia|Colombia| ,  |Ecuador|Ecuador| ,  |Peru|Peru| ,  |Bolivia|Bolivia| ,  |Chile|Chile|  and  |Argentina|Argentina| .     Along their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate  |depressions|Depression| . The Andes are the location of several high  |plateaus|Plateau|  – some of which host major cities such as  |Quito|Quito| ,  |Bogotá|Bogotá| ,  |Cali|Cali| ,  |Arequipa|Arequipa| ,  |Medellín|Medellín| ,  |Bucaramanga|Bucaramanga| ,  |Sucre|Sucre| ,  |Mérida|Mérida_Mérida|  and  |La_Paz|La_Paz| . The  |Altiplano_plateau|Altiplano|  is the worlds second-highest after the  |Tibetan_plateau|Tibetan_Plateau| . These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the  |Tropical_Andes|Tropical_Andes| , the  |Dry_Andes|Dry_Andes| , and the  |Wet_Andes|Wet_Andes| .     The Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentinas Mount  |Aconcagua|Aconcagua| , rises to an elevation of about  above sea level. The  |peak|Summit|  of  |Chimborazo|Chimborazo|  in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earths center than any other location on the Earths surface, due to the  |equatorial_bulge|Equatorial_Bulge|  resulting from the  |Earths_rotation|Earths_Rotation| . The worlds highest  |volcano|Volcano| es are in the Andes, including  |Ojos_del_Salado|Ojos_Del_Salado|  on the Chile-Argentina border, which rises to .     The Andes are also part of the  |American_Cordillera|American_Cordillera| , a chain of mountain ranges  that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western backbone of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.               The etymology of the word Andes has been debated. The majority consensus is that it derives from the  |Quechua|Quechua_Languages|  word , which means east Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyaykancha, La Paz, 2007 as in  Antisuyu  , one of the four regions of the  |Inca_Empire|Inca_Empire| .       The Andes can be divided into three sections:   The Southern Andes  in Argentina and Chile   The Central Andes in Peru and Bolivia   The Northern Andes in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador     In the northern part of the Andes, the isolated  |Sierra_Nevada_de_Santa_Marta|Sierra_Nevada_De_Santa_Marta|  range is often considered to be part of the Andes.  The term cordillera comes from the Spanish word cordel ,  meaning rope . The Andes range is about  wide throughout its length, except in the  |Bolivian_flexure|Orocline|  where it is about  wide. The  |Leeward_Antilles|Leeward_Antilles|  islands  |Aruba|Aruba| ,  |Bonaire|Bonaire| , and  |Curaçao|Curaçao| , which lie in the  |Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean_Sea|  off the coast of Venezuela, were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the Andes range, but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the South American and Caribbean plates.             The Andes are a  |Mesozoic|Mesozoic| – |Tertiary|Tertiary| |_orogenic|Orogenic|  belt of mountains along the  |Pacific_Ring_of_Fire|Pacific_Ring_Of_Fire| , a zone of  |volcanic_activity|Volcanic_Activity|  that encompasses the Pacific rim of the Americas as well as the  |Asia_Pacific|Asia_Pacific|  region. The Andes are the result of  |tectonic_plate|Tectonic_Plate|  processes, caused by the  |subduction|Subduction|  of  |oceanic_crust|Oceanic_Crust|  beneath the  |South_American_Plate|South_American_Plate| . It is the result of a convergent plate boundary between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of the western rim of the  |South_American_Plate|South_American_Plate|  due to the subduction of the  |Nazca_Plate|Nazca_Plate|  and the  |Antarctic_Plate|Antarctic_Plate| . To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several  |sedimentary_basins|Sedimentary_Basin| , such as  |Orinoco|Orinoco| ,  |Amazon_Basin|Amazon_Basin| ,  |Madre_de_Dios|Madre_De_Dios_River|  and  |Gran_Chaco|Gran_Chaco| , that separate the Andes from the ancient  |cratons|Craton|  in eastern South America. In the south, the Andes share a long boundary with the former  |Patagonia_Terrane|Patagoniageology| . To the west, the Andes end at the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| , although the  |Peru_Chile_trench|Peru_Chile_Trench|  can be considered their ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach, the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography. The Andes Mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range.     The Andean orogen has a series of bends or  |oroclines|Orocline| . The Bolivian Orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of South America and the Andes Mountains at about 18° S.  At this point, the orientation of the Andes turns from Northwest in  |Peru|Peru|  to South in  |Chile|Chile|  and  |Argentina|Argentina| . The Andean segment north and south of the orocline have been rotated 15° to 20° counter clockwise and clockwise respectively.  The Bolivian Orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the  |Altiplano_Plateau|Altiplano|  and according to Isacks the orocline is related to  |crustal_shortening|Crustal_Shortening| .  The specific point at 18° S where the coastline bends is known as the Arica Elbow .  Further south lies the Maipo Orocline a more subtle orocline between 30° S and 38°S with a seaward-concave break in trend at 33° S.  Near the southern tip of the Andes lies the Patagonian orocline.           The western rim of the  |South_American_Plate|South_American_Plate|  has been the place of several pre-Andean  |orogenies|Orogeny|  since at least the late  |Proterozoic|Proterozoic|  and early  |Paleozoic|Paleozoic| , when several  |terranes|Terrane|  and  |microcontinents|Microcontinent|  collided and amalgamated with the ancient  |cratons|Craton|  of eastern South America, by then the  |South_American_part|South_American_Plate|  of  |Gondwana|Gondwana| .     The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the  |Triassic|Triassic|  when  |Pangaea|Pangaea|  began the break up that resulted in developing several  |rifts|Rift| . The development continued through the  |Jurassic|Jurassic|  Period. It was during the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  Period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the  |uplifting|Tectonic_Uplift| ,  |faulting|Fault|  and  |folding|Fold|  of  |sedimentary|Sedimentary_Rock|  and  |metamorphic|Metamorphic_Rock|  rocks of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant, as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and  |erosion|Erosion| .     Tectonic forces above the  |subduction_zone|Subduction_Zone|  along the entire west coast of South America where the  |Nazca_Plate|Nazca_Plate|  and a part of the  |Antarctic_Plate|Antarctic_Plate|  are sliding beneath the  |South_American_Plate|South_American_Plate|  continue to produce an ongoing  |orogenic_event|Orogeny|  resulting in minor to major  |earthquakes|Earthquake|  and  |volcanic_eruptions|Volcanic_Eruption|  to this day. In the extreme south, a major  |transform_fault|Transform_Fault|  separates  |Tierra_del_Fuego|Tierra_Del_Fuego|  from the small  |Scotia_Plate|Scotia_Plate| . Across the  wide  |Drake_Passage|Drake_Passage|  lie the mountains of the  |Antarctic_Peninsula|Antarctic_Peninsula|  south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain.      The regions immediately east of the Andes experience a series of changes resulting from the Andean orogeny. Parts of the  |Sunsás_Orogen|Sunsás_Orogeny|  in  |Amazonian_craton|Amazonian_Craton|  disappeared from the surface of earth being  |overridden|Thrust_Fault|  by the Andes.    The  |Sierras_de_Córdoba|Sierras_De_Córdoba| , where the effects of the ancient  |Pampean_orogeny|Pampean_Orogeny|  can be observed, owe their modern uplift and relief to the  |Andean_orogeny|Andean_Orogeny|  in the  |Tertiary|Tertiary| .  Further south in southern  |Patagonia|Patagonia|  the onset of the Andean orogeny caused the  |Magallanes_Basin|Magallanes_Basin|  to evolve from being an  |extensional|Extensional_Tectonics| |_back_arc_basin|Back_Arc_Basin|  in the  |Mesozoic|Mesozoic|  to being a compressional  |foreland_basin|Andean_Foreland_Basin|  in the  |Cenozoic|Cenozoic| .                   The Andes range has many active volcanoes distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity. The Andean volcanism is a result of  |subduction|Subduction|  of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate underneath the South American Plate. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighbouring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for  |calc_alkalic|Calc_Alkalic|  and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of  |mid_ocean_ridges|Mid_Ocean_Ridge|  and  |seamount|Seamount|  chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and  |magma|Magma|  ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.       The Andes Mountains host large  |ore|Ore|  and  |salt|Salt|  deposits and some of their eastern  |fold_and_thrust_belt|Fold_And_Thrust_Belt|  acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of  |hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon| . In the forelands of the  |Atacama_desert|Atacama_Desert|  some of the largest  |porphyry_copper|Porphyry_Copper|  mineralizations occurs making Chile and Peru the first and second largest exporters of  |copper|Copper|  in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by  |hydrothermal_fluids|Hydrothermal_Fluid|  during the cooling of  |plutons|Pluton|  or volcanic systems. The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of  |meteoric_water|Meteoric_Water| . The dry climate in the central western Andes has also led to the creation of extensive  |saltpeter_deposits|Chile_Saltpeter|  which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the  |salars|Dry_Lake|  of  |Atacama|Salar_De_Atacama|  and  |Uyuni|Salar_De_Uyuni| , the first one being the largest source of  |lithium|Lithium|  today and the second the worlds largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and  |Neogene|Neogene|  plutonism in Bolivias Cordillera Central created the Bolivian  |tin|Tin|  belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of  |Cerro_Rico_de_Potosí|Cerro_Rico| .                  The climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on latitude, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central section is dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of  in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances.  |Rainforests|Rainforest|  exist just miles away from the snow-covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The  |snow_line|Snow_Line|  depends on the location. It is at between  in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to  in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S before descending to  on Aconcagua at 32°S,  at 40°S,  at 50°S, and only  in  |Tierra_del_Fuego|Tierra_Del_Fuego|  at 55°S; from 50°S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.          The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones: the  |Dry_Andes|Dry_Andes|  and the  |Wet_Andes|Wet_Andes| . Since the Dry Andes extend from the latitudes of  |Atacama_Desert|Atacama_Desert|  to the area of  |Maule_River|Maule_River| , precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations. The line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time, leaving a whole glacier in the  |ablation|Ablation|  area or in the  |accumulation_area|Glacier_Ice_Accumulation| .     In the high Andes of central Chile and  |Mendoza_Province|Mendoza_Province| ,  |rock_glaciers|Rock_Glacier|  are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to  |solar_radiation|Solar_Radiation| . Jan-Christoph Otto, Joachim Götz, Markus Keuschnig, Ingo Hartmeyer, Dario Trombotto, and Lothar Schrott . Geomorphological and geophysical investigation of a complex rock glacier system – Morenas Coloradas valley     Though precipitation increases with the height, there are semiarid conditions in the nearly  highest mountains of the Andes. This dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at 32–34° S. The valley bottoms have no woods, just dwarf scrub. The largest glaciers, as e.g. the Plomo glacier and the Horcones glaciers, do not even reach  in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness. At glacial times, however, c. 20,000 years ago, the glaciers were over ten times longer. On the east side of this section of the Mendozina Andes, they flowed down to  and on the west side to about  above sea level.

The massifs of Cerro Aconcagua , Cerro Tupungato  and Nevado Juncal  are tens of kilometres away from each other and were connected by a joint ice stream network. The Andes dendritic glacier arms, i.e. components of valley glaciers, were up to  long, over  thick and overspanned a vertical distance of .

The Andean region cuts across several  |natural|Natural_Region|  and floristic regions due to its extension from  |Caribbean|Caribbean|  Venezuela to cold, windy and wet  |Cape_Horn|Cape_Horn|  passing through the hyperarid Atacama Desert.  |Rainforests|Rainforest|  and  |tropical_dry_forests|Tropical_And_Subtropical_Dry_Broadleaf_Forests|   used to encircle much of the northern Andes but are now greatly  |diminished|Deforestation| , especially in the  |Chocó|El_Chocó|  and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. Opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the relatively dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. Along with several  |Interandean_Valles|Interandean_Valles| , they are typically dominated by  |deciduous|Deciduous|  woodland, shrub and  |xeric|Xeric|  vegetation, reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless Atacama Desert.     About 30,000 species of  |vascular_plants|Vascular_Plants|  live in the Andes, with roughly half being  |endemic|Endemism|  to the region, surpassing the diversity of any other  |hotspot|Biodiversity_Hotspot| . The small tree  Cinchona pubescens , a source of  |quinine|Quinine|  which is used to treat  |malaria|Malaria| , is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that originated from the Andes are  |tobacco|Tobacco|  and  |potato|Potato| es. The high-altitude  Polylepis  forests and woodlands are found in the Andean areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees, by locals referred to as Queñua, Yagual and other names, can be found at altitudes of  above sea level. It remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the  |Inca|Inca| n period. Regardless, in  |modern_times|Modern_History|  the clearance has accelerated, and the trees are now considered to be highly  |endangered|Endangered| , with some believing that as little as 10% of the original woodland remains.                 The Andes are rich in fauna: With almost 1,000 species, of which roughly 2/3 are  |endemic|Endemism|  to the region, the Andes are the most important region in the world for  |amphibians|Amphibian| .   – biodiversityhotspots.org   The diversity of animals in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of  |mammals|Mammal|  , more than 1,700 species of birds , more than 600 species of  |reptile|Reptile|  , and almost 400 species of fish .     The  |vicuña|Vicuña|  and  |guanaco|Guanaco|  can be found living in the  |Altiplano|Altiplano| , while the closely related  |domesticated|Domestication| |_llama|Llama|  and  |alpaca|Alpaca|  are widely kept by locals as  |pack_animals|Pack_Animal|  and for their  |meat|Meat|  and  |wool|Wool| .

A few species of  |hummingbirds|Hummingbirds| , notably some  |hillstars|Oreotrochilus| , can be seen at altitudes above , but far higher  |diversities|Species_Richness|  can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests  growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. These forest-types, which includes the  |Yungas|Yungas|  and parts of the Chocó, are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exist, exceptions being the threatened  |mountain_tapir|Mountain_Tapir| ,  |spectacled_bear|Spectacled_Bear|  and  |yellow_tailed_woolly_monkey|Yellow_Tailed_Woolly_Monkey| .     Birds of humid Andean forests include  |mountain_toucans|Mountain_Toucan| ,  |quetzals|Quetzal|  and the  |Andean_cock_of_the_rock|Andean_Cock_Of_The_Rock| , while  |mixed_species_flocks|Mixed_Species_Flock|  dominated by  |tanagers|Tanagers|  and  |furnariids|Furnariids|  commonly are seen – in contrast to several vocal but typically  |cryptic|Crypsis|  species of  |wrens|Wrens| ,  |tapaculos|Tapaculo|  and  |antpittas|Antpitta| .

The Andes Mountains form a north-south axis of cultural influences. A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the  |Inca_civilization|Inca_Civilization|  and  |Inca_Empire|Inca_Empire|  in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through  |imperialistic|Imperialism| |_militarism|Militarism|  as well as careful and meticulous governmental management. DAltroy, Terence N. The Incas. Blackwell Publishing, 2003 The government sponsored the construction of  |aqueducts|Aqueduct|  and  |roads|Roads|  in addition to preexisting installations. Some of these constructions are still in existence today.     Devastated by European diseases to which they had no  |immunity|Immunity|  and  |civil_wars|Inca_Civil_War| , in 1532 the Incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated  and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by  |Francisco_Pizarro|Francisco_Pizarro| . One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was  |Machu_Picchu|Machu_Picchu| , which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the  |Quechua|Quechua_Languages|  and  |Aymara_language|Aymara_Language|  families.  |Woodbine_Parish|Woodbine_Parish|  and  |Joseph_Barclay_Pentland|Joseph_Barclay_Pentland|  surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes from 1826 to 1827.                In modern times, the largest cities in the Andes are  |Bogotá|Bogotá| , with a population of about eight million,  |Santiago|Santiago| ,  |Medellín|Medellín| , and  |Cali|Cali| .  |Lima|Lima|  is a coastal city adjacent to the Andes and is the largest city of all Andean countries.

The cities of  |Caracas|Caracas| ,  |Valencia|Valencia_Carabobo| , and  |Maracay|Maracay|  are in the  |Venezuelan_Coastal_Range|Venezuelan_Coastal_Range| , which is a debatable extension of the Andes at the northern extreme of South America.         Cities and large towns are connected with  |asphalt|Asphalt| -paved roads, while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads, which may require a  |four_wheel_drive|Four_Wheel_Drive|  vehicle.           The rough terrain has historically put the costs of building  |highways|Highway|  and  |railroads|Railroad|  that cross the Andes out of reach of most neighboring countries, even with modern  |civil_engineering|Civil_Engineering|  practices. For example, the main crossover of the Andes between Argentina and Chile is still accomplished through the  |Paso_Internacional_Los_Libertadores|Paso_Internacional_Los_Libertadores| . Only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected.  Much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft.     However, there is one railroad that connects Chile with Peru via the Andes, and there are others that make the same connection via southern Bolivia. See railroad maps of that region.     There are multiple highways in Bolivia that cross the Andes. Some of these were built during a  |period_of_war|Chaco_War|  between Bolivia and  |Paraguay|Paraguay| , in order to transport Bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern Bolivia and western Paraguay.     For decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the  |War_of_the_Pacific|War_Of_The_Pacific|  between Chile, the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Peru out of the war. The  |Chilean_Army|Chilean_Army|  and  |Chilean_Navy|Chilean_Navy|  defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivias only province on the Pacific Coast, some land from Peru that was returned to Peru decades later. Bolivia has been a completely  |landlocked|Landlocked|  country ever since. It mostly uses  |seaports|Seaport|  in eastern Argentina and  |Uruguay|Uruguay|  for international trade because its diplomatic relations with Chile have been suspended since 1978.     Because of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in the mountains—to which travel via  |motorized_vehicles|Motorized_Vehicle|  is of little use—are still located in the high Andes of Chile, Bolivia, Peru, and  |Ecuador|Ecuador| . Locally, the relatives of the  |camel|Camel| , the  |llama|Llama| , and the  |alpaca|Alpaca|  continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times.  |Donkeys|Donkey| ,  |mules|Mule| , and horses are also useful.               The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practiced  |irrigation|Irrigation|  techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes,  |terracing|Andén|  has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The  |potato|Potato|  holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop.  |Maize|Maize|  was also an important crop for these people, and was used for the production of  |chicha|Chicha| , important to Andean native people. Currently,  |tobacco|Tobacco| ,  |cotton|Cotton|  and  |coffee|Coffee|  are the main export crops.  |Coca|Coca| , despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating  |herbal_tea|Herbal_Tea| , and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of  |cocaine|Cocaine| .            In unirrigated land,  |pasture|Pasture|  is the most common type of land use. In the rainy season , part of the rangeland is used for cropping .     Irrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage. Also, by early sowing, maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains . In addition it makes cropping in the dry season possible and allows the cultivation of frost resistant vegetable crops like  |onion|Onion|  and  |carrot|Carrot| . W. van Immerzeel, 1989.

On line:           The Andes rose to fame for their mineral wealth during the  |Spanish_conquest_of_South_America|Spanish_Colonization_Of_The_Americas| . Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals, the  |mineralizations|Mineralization|  of the Andes were first mined in large scale after the Spanish arrival.  |Potosí|Potosí|  in present-day  |Bolivia|Bolivia|  and  |Cerro_de_Pasco|Cerro_De_Pasco|  in Peru were one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World.  |Río_de_la_Plata|Río_De_La_Plata|  and  |Argentina|Argentina|   derive their names from the silver of Potosí.     Currently, mining in the Andes of  |Chile|Chile|  and  |Peru|Peru|  places these countries as the first and third major producers of  |copper|Copper|  in the world.  |Peru|Peru|  also contains the 4th largest goldmine in the world: the  |Yanacocha|Yanacocha| . The Bolivian Andes produce principally  |tin|Tin|  although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the  |economy|Price_Revolution|  of 17th century Europe.     There is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish  |silver|Silver| |_mines|Mining|  in  |Potosí|Potosí|  in the 16th century to the vast current  |porphyry_copper_deposits|Porphyry_Copper_Deposit|  of  |Chuquicamata|Chuquicamata|  and  |Escondida|Escondida|  in Chile and  |Toquepala|Toquepala_Mine|  in Peru. Other metals including iron, gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are important.          This list contains some of the major peaks in the Andes mountain range. The highest peak is Aconcagua of Argentina .            |Aconcagua|Aconcagua| ,   |Cerro_Bonete|Cerro_Bonete| ,   |Galán|Galán| ,   |Mercedario|Mercedario| ,   |Pissis|Monte_Pissis| ,   |Cerro_Bayo|Cerro_Bayo_Complex| ,   |Cerro_Fitz_Roy|Cerro_Fitz_Roy| ,  or 3,405  m,  |Patagonia|Patagonia| , also known as Cerro Chaltén    |Cerro_Escorial|Cerro_Escorial| ,   |Cordón_del_Azufre|Cordón_Del_Azufre| ,   |Falso_Azufre|Falso_Azufre| ,   |Incahuasi|Incahuasi| ,   |Lastarria|Lastarria| ,   |Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco| ,   |Maipo|Maipo| ,   |Marmolejo|Marmolejo| ,   |Ojos_del_Salado|Ojos_Del_Salado| ,   |Olca|Olca| ,   |Sierra_Nevada_de_Lagunas_Bravas|Sierra_Nevada_De_Lagunas_Bravas| ,   |Socompa|Socompa| ,   |Nevado_Tres_Cruces|Nevado_Tres_Cruces| ,     |Tronador|Tronador| ,   |Tupungato|Tupungato| ,   |Nacimiento|Cerro_Del_Nacimiento| ,          |Janqu_Uma|Janqu_Uma| ,   |Cabaray|Cabaray| a,   |Chacaltaya|Chacaltaya| ,   |Wayna_Potosí|Huayna_Potosí| ,   |Illampu|Illampu| ,   |Illimani|Illimani| ,   |Laram_Qawa|Macizo_De_Larancagua| ,   |Macizo_de_Pacuni|Macizo_De_Pacuni| ,   |Nevado_Anallajsi|Nevado_Anallajsi| ,   |Nevado_Sajama|Nevado_Sajama| ,   |Patilla_Pata|Patilla_Pata| ,   |Tata_Sabaya|Tata_Sabaya| ,          |Acotango|Acotango| ,   |Michincha|Cerro_Minchincha| ,   |Iru_Phutunqu|Iru_Phutunqu| ,   |Licancabur|Licancabur| ,   |Olca|Olca| ,   |Parinacota|Parinacota_Volcano| ,   |Paruma|Paruma| ,   |Pomerape|Pomerape| ,             |Monte_San_Valentin|Monte_San_Valentin| ,   |Cerro_Paine_Grande|Cordillera_Del_Paine| ,   |Cerro_Macá|Cerro_Macá| , c.  |Monte_Darwin|Monte_Darwin| , c.  |Volcan_Hudson|Volcan_Hudson| , c.  |Cerro_Castillo_Dynevor|Cerro_Castillo_Dynevor| , c.  |Mount_Tarn|Mount_Tarn| , c.  |Polleras|Polleras| , c.  |Acamarachi|Acamarachi| , c.         |Pico_Cristóbal_Colón|Pico_Cristóbal_Colón| ,   |Nevado_del_Huila|Nevado_Del_Huila| ,   |Nevado_del_Ruiz|Nevado_Del_Ruiz| ,   |Nevado_del_Tolima|Nevado_Del_Tolima| ,   |Pico_Pan_de_Azúcar|Sierra_Nevada_Del_Cocuy| ,   |Ritacuba_Negro|Sierra_Nevada_Del_Cocuy| ,   |Nevado_del_Cumbal|Cumbal_Volcano| ,   |Cerro_Negro_de_Mayasquer|Cerro_Negro_De_Mayasquer| ,   |Ritacuba_Blanco|Sierra_Nevada_Del_Cocuy| ,   |Nevado_del_Quindío|Nevado_Del_Quindío| ,   |Puracé|Puracé| ,   |Santa_Isabel|Santa_Isabel| ,   |Doña_Juana|Doña_Juana| ,   |Galeras|Galeras| ,   |Azufral|Azufral| .          |Antisana|Antisana| ,   |Cayambe|Cayambe| ,   |Chiles|Chiles| ,   |Chimborazo|Chimborazo| ,   |Corazón|Corazón| ,   |Cotopaxi|Cotopaxi| ,   |El_Altar|El_Altar| ,   |Illiniza|Illiniza| ,   |Pichincha|Pichincha_Volcano| ,   |Quilotoa|Quilotoa| ,   |Reventador|Reventador| ,   |Sangay|Sangay| ,   |Tungurahua|Tungurahua| ,          |Alpamayo|Alpamayo| ,   |Artesonraju|Artesonraju| ,   |Carnicero|Carnicero| ,   |Chumpe|Chumpe| ,   |Coropuna|Coropuna| ,   |El_Misti|El_Misti| ,   |El_Toro|El_Toro| ,   |Huandoy|Huandoy| ,   |Huascarán|Huascarán| ,   |Jirishanca|Jirishanca| ,   |Pumasillo|Pumasillo| ,   |Rasac|Rasac| ,   |Rondoy|Rondoy| ,   |Sarapo|Sarapo| ,   |Salcantay|Salcantay| ,   |Seria_Norte|Seria_Norte| ,   |Siula_Grande|Siula_Grande| ,   |Huaytapallana|Huaytapallana| ,   |Yerupaja|Yerupaja| ,   |Yerupaja_Chico|Yerupaja_Chico| ,          |Pico_Bolívar|Pico_Bolívar| ,   |Pico_Humboldt|Pico_Humboldt| ,   |Pico_Bonpland|Pico_Bonpland| ,   |Pico_La_Concha|Pico_La_Concha| ,   |Pico_Piedras_Blancas|Pico_Piedras_Blancas| ,   |Pico_El_Águila|Pico_El_Águila| ,   |Pico_El_Toro|Pico_El_Toro| |_Pico_El_León|Pico_El_León| |_Pico_Mucuñuque|Pico_Mucuñuque|   .
