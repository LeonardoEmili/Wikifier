             Surfing is a  |surface_water_sport|List_Of_Surface_Water_Sports|  in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or face of a moving  |wave|Wind_Wave| , which usually carries the surfer towards the  |shore|Shore| . Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the  |ocean|Ocean| , but can also be found in  |lakes|Lake_Surfing|  or  |rivers|River_Surfing|  in the form of a  |standing_wave|Standing_Wave|  or  |tidal_bore|Tidal_Bore| . However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial  |wave_pools|Wave_Pool| .      The term surfing refers to the act of riding a wave with a board, regardless of the stance used. There are several types of boards. The  |native_peoples_of_the_Pacific|Polynesian_Culture| , for instance, surfed waves on  |alaia|Alaia| , paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a  |surfboard|Surfboard| ; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.     Another prominent form of surfing is  |body_boarding|Body_Boarding| , when a surfer rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee, or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting , and using foils.  |Body_surfing|Body_Surfing| , where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfers own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing.     Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are  |stand_up_paddling|Standup_Paddleboarding| ,  |long_boarding|Surfboardlong_Board|  and  |short_boarding|Surfboardshort_Board|  with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.     In  |tow_in_surfing|Tow_In_Surfing|  , a motorized water vehicle such as a  |personal_watercraft|Personal_Watercraft| , tows the surfer into the wave front helping the surfer match a large waves speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as  |paddle_boarding|Paddle_Boarding|  and  |sea_kayaking|Sea_Kayaking|  do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as  |kite_surfing|Kite_Surfing|  and  |windsurfing|Windsurfing|  rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of  |V_drive|V_Drive|  boats,  |Wakesurfing|Wakesurfing| , in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The  |Guinness_Book_of_World_Records|Guinness_Book_Of_World_Records|  recognized a  wave ride by  |Garrett_McNamara|Garrett_Mcnamara|  at  |Nazaré|Nazaré_Portugal| ,  |Portugal|Portugal|  as the largest wave ever surfed.                For hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient  |Polynesian_culture|Polynesian_Culture| .
