           Lammas Day , is a  |holiday|Holiday|  celebrated in some  |English_speaking|English_Speaking_World|  countries in the  |Northern_Hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere|  on 1 August. It is a  |festival|Festival|  to mark the annual  |wheat|Wheat| |_harvest|Harvest| , and is the first  |harvest_festival|Harvest_Festival|  of the year. On this day it was customary to bring to  |church|Church|  a loaf made from the new crop, which began to be harvested at Lammastide, which falls at the halfway point between the summer  |Solstice|Solstice|  and Autumn  |September_Equinox|September_Equinox| .     The loaf was blessed, and in  |Anglo_Saxon_England|Anglo_Saxon_England|  it might be employed afterwards in protective rituals: T.C. Cokayne, ed. Leechdoms, Wortcunning and Starcarft vol. III:291, noted by  |George_C_Homans|George_C_Homans| , English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century, 2nd ed. 1991:371. a book of Anglo-Saxon charms directed that the lammas bread be broken into four bits, which were to be placed at the four corners of the barn, to protect the garnered grain.     In many parts of  |England|England| , tenants were bound to present freshly harvested wheat to their landlords on or before the first day of August. In the  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , where it is referred to regularly, it is called the feast of  |first_fruits|First_Fruits|  . The blessing of  |first_fruits|First_Fruits|  was performed annually in both the  |Eastern|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  and  |Western|Roman_Catholic_Church|  Churches on the first or the sixth of August .      Lammas has coincided with the feast of  |St_Peter_in_Chains|Liberation_Of_Saint_Peter| , commemorating St. Peters miraculous deliverance from prison, but in the liturgical reform of 1969, the feast of St.  |Alphonsus_Liguori|Alphonsus_Liguori|  was transferred to this day, the day of St. Alphonsus death.       In medieval times the feast was sometimes known in England and Scotland as the Gule of August , J.P. Bacon Phillips, inquiring the significance of gule , Lammas-Day and the Gule of August , Notes and Queries, 2 August 1930:83. but the meaning of gule is unclear.  |Ronald_Hutton|Ronald_Hutton|  suggests Hutton, The Stations of the Sun, Oxford 1996. following the 18th-century Welsh clergyman antiquary  |John_Pettingall|John_Pettingall|  Pettingall, in Archaeologia or, Miscellaneous tracts, relating to antiquity... , 2 |Anglicisation|English_Language|  of , the  |Welsh|Welsh_Language|  name of the feast of August . The  OED  and most etymological dictionaries give it a more circuitous origin similar to gullet; from  |Old_French|Old_French|  , a diminutive of , throat, neck, from  |Latin|Latin|   throat .     Several antiquaries beginning with  |John_Brady|John_Brady|  Brady, Clavis Calendaris, 1812, etc. s.v. Lammas-Day . offered a back-construction to its being originally known as Lamb-mass, under the undocumented supposition that tenants of the Cathedral of York, dedicated to St. Peter ad Vincula, of which this is the feast, would have been required to bring a live lamb to the church, Reported without comment in John Brand, Henry Ellis, J.O. Halliwell-Phillips, Observations on the Popular Antiquities of Great Britain, new ed. 1899: vol. I, s.v. Lammas . or, with  |John_Skinner|John_Skinner| , because Lambs then grew out of season. This is a  |folk_etymology|Folk_Etymology| , of which  OED  notes that it was subsequently felt as if from LAMB + MASS .     For many  |villeins|Villein| , the wheat must have run low in the days before Lammas, and the new harvest began a season of plenty, of hard work and company in the fields, reaping in teams. Noted by Homans 1991:371. Thus there was a spirit of celebratory play.     In the medieval agricultural year, Lammas also marked the end of the  |hay|Hay|  harvest that had begun after  |Midsummer|Midsummer| . At the end of hay-making a sheep would be loosed in the meadow among the mowers, for him to keep who could catch it. Homans 1991:371.     In  |Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|   Romeo and Juliet  it is observed of Juliet, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen. Since Juliet was born Lammas eve, she came before the harvest festival, which is significant since her life ended before she could reap what she had sown and enjoy the bounty of the harvest, in this case full consummation and enjoyment of her love with Romeo.     Another well-known cultural reference is the opening of  The Battle of Otterburn  |William_Hone|William_Hone|  speaks in The Every-Day Book of a later festive Lammas day sport common among Scottish farmers near Edinburgh. He says that they build towers...leaving a hole for a flag-pole in the centre so that they may raise their colours. When the flags over the many peat-constructed towers were raised, farmers would go to others towers and attempt to level them to the ground. A successful attempt would bring great praise. However, people were allowed to defend their towers, and so everyone was provided with a tooting-horn to alert nearby country folk of the impending attack and the battle would turn into a brawl. According to Hone, more than four people had died at this festival and many more were injured. At the days end, races were held, with prizes given to the townspeople.             |Lughnasadh|Lughnasadh|  or Lammas is also the name used for one of the eight sabbats in the  |Neopagan|Contemporary_Paganism| |_Wheel_of_the_Year|Wheel_Of_The_Year| . It is the first of the three autumn  |harvest|Harvest|  festivals, the other two being the  |autumn_equinox|Autumn_Equinox|  and  |Samhain|Samhain| . In the Northern Hemisphere it takes place around 1 August, while in the Southern Hemisphere it is celebrated around 1 February.           Lammas is one of the  |Scottish_quarter_days|Scottish_Term_Days| .     Lammas leaves or  Lammas growth  refers to a second crop of leaves produced in high summer by some species of trees in  |temperate_countries|Temperate_Countries|  to replace those lost to insect damage. They often differ slightly in shape, texture and/or hairiness from the earlier leaves.
