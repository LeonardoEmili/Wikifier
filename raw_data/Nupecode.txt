NupeCode is free/open source software  designed for large  |peer_review|Peer_Review|  projects. The code was available via  |Nupedias|Nupedia|  CVS repository. One of the problems experienced by Nupedia during much of its existence was that the software lacked functionality. Much of the missing functionality had been mocked-up using underlined blocks of text that appeared to be hyperlinks, but actually were not.     As part of the project, a new version of the original software  was under development. NuNupedia was implemented for testing at  |SourceForge|Sourceforge| , but never reached sufficient development to replace the original software.
