                 Mark David McGwire , nicknamed Big Mac, is an  |American|Americans|  former  |professional_baseball|Professional_Baseball| |_first_baseman|First_Baseman| . His  |Major_League_Baseball|Major_League_Baseball|  playing career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the  |Oakland_Athletics|Oakland_Athletics|  and the  |St_Louis_Cardinals|St_Louis_Cardinals| , winning one  |World_Series|World_Series|  championship each with Oakland as a player in  |1989|1989_World_Series|  and with St. Louis as a coach in  |2011|2011_World_Series| . One of the most prolific  |home_run|Home_Run|  hitters in baseball history, McGwire holds the major league career record for  |at_bats_per_home_run|At_Bats_Per_Home_Run|  ratio , and is the former record holder for both  |home_runs_in_a_single_season|List_Of_Major_League_Baseball_Progressive_Single_Season_Home_Run_Leaders|  and home runs hit by rookie .     He ranks 11th all time in  |home_runs|Home_Run|  with 583, and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons, while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245. Further, he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter, producing a career .394  |on_base_percentage|On_Base_Percentage|  and twice leading the major leagues in  |bases_on_balls|Bases_On_Balls| . Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons. A right-handed batter and thrower, McGwire stood  tall and weighed  during his playing career.     Born in  |Pomona_California|Pomona_California| , McGwire was selected by the Athletics with the 10th overall selection in the  |1984_MLB_draft|1984_Major_League_Baseball_Draft| , and he was a member of the  |silver_medal|Silver_Medal| -winning entry of the  |United_States_national_team|United_States_National_Baseball_Team|  that  |same_year|Baseball_At_The_1984_Summer_Olympics|  at the  |Summer_Olympics|1984_Summer_Olympics|  in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| , with Japan finishing ahead for gold medal.     As a rookie in 1987, he quickly grabbed media attention with 33 home runs before the  |All_Star|1987_Major_League_Baseball_All_Star_Game|  break, and led the major leagues in home runs that year with 49, which was a single-season rookie home run record. He appeared in six straight All-Star Games from 1987 to 1992 despite a brief career decline related to injuries. Another string of six consecutive All-Star appearances followed from 1995 to 2001. Each season from 1996 to 1999, he again led the major leagues in home runs.     A part of the  |1998_Major_League_Baseball_home_run_record_chase|1998_Major_League_Baseball_Home_Run_Record_Chase|  of  |Roger_Maris|Roger_Maris|  61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the  |major_league_single_season_home_run_record|Major_League_Baseball_Single_Season_Home_Run_Record|  with 70,  which  |Barry_Bonds|Barry_Bonds|  broke three years later with 73.  McGwire also led the league in  |runs_batted_in|Runs_Batted_In| , twice in  |bases_on_balls|Bases_On_Balls|  and  |on_base_percentage|On_Base_Percentage| , and four times in  |slugging_percentage|Slugging_Percentage| . Injuries significantly cut into his playing time in 2000 and 2001 before factoring into his retirement. He finished with 583 home runs, which was  |fifth_all_time|500_Home_Run_Club|  when he retired.      For his career, McGwire averaged a home run once every 10.61 at bats, the best  |at_bats_per_home_run|At_Bats_Per_Home_Run|  ratio in baseball history .  He was the fastest player to hit 500 home runs, in 5,487 at-bats.      McGwire was a central figure in baseballs  |steroids_scandal|Doping_In_Baseball| . In 2010, McGwire publicly admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during a large portion of his career.  In his first ten years of eligibility, McGwire has not been elected into the  |National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame|National_Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame| .          McGwire was born in  |Pomona_California|Pomona_California| . His father was a  |dentist|Dentist| . He attended  |Damien_High_School|Damien_High_School|  in  |La_Verne_California|La_Verne_California| , where he played baseball, golf, and basketball. He was drafted by the  |Montreal_Expos|Montreal_Expos|  in the 1981 amateur draft but did not sign.  He played college baseball at the  |University_of_Southern_California|University_Of_Southern_California|   under coach  |Rod_Dedeaux|Rod_Dedeaux| .             After three years at Southern California and a stint on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, the  |Oakland_Athletics|Oakland_Athletics|  drafted McGwire tenth overall in the  |1984_Major_League_Baseball_draft|1984_Major_League_Baseball_Draft| .     In a short cameo, McGwire debuted in the major leagues in August  |1986|1986_Oakland_Athletics_Season| , hitting three  |home_runs|Home_Run|  and nine  |runs_batted_in|Runs_Batted_In|  in 18 games.         Retaining his rookie status in  |1987|1987_Major_League_Baseball_Season| , McGwire took center stage in baseball with his home runs. He hit just four in the month of April, but followed in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the  |American_League|American_League| |_All_Star_team|1987_Major_League_Baseball_All_Star_Game| . On August 11, he broke  |Al_Rosens|Al_Rosen|  AL rookie record of 37 home runs.  Three days later, McGwire broke the major league record of 38, which  |Frank_Robinson|Frank_Robinson|  and  |Wally_Berger|Wally_Berger|  jointly held. In September, McGwire hit nine more home runs while posting monthly personal bests of a .351  |batting_average|Batting_Average| , .419  |on_base_percentage|On_Base_Percentage|  and 11  |doubles|Double|  . With 49 HR and two games remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child. McGwire also totaled 118  |runs_batted_in|Runs_Batted_In|  , .289 batting average, 97  |runs|Run|  scored, 28 doubles, a .618  |slugging_percentage|Slugging_Percentage|  and a .370  |on_base_percentage|On_Base_Percentage|  . McGwires 49 home runs as a rookie stood as a major league record until  |Aaron_Judge|Aaron_Judge|  hit 52 for the  |New_York_Yankees|New_York_Yankees|  in 2017.      Not only did he lead the AL in home runs in 1987, but he also tied for the major league lead with  |Chicago_Cubs|1987_Chicago_Cubs_Season|  right fielder  |Andre_Dawson|Andre_Dawson| . McGwire also led the major leagues in SLG, finished second in the AL in adjusted  |on_base_plus_slugging|On_Base_Plus_Slugging|  percentage total bases , third in RBI and on-base plus slugging . He was thus a unanimous choice for the AL  |Rookie_of_the_Year_Award|Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_Of_The_Year_Award|  and finished sixth overall in the AL  |Most_Valuable_Player_Award|Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award|  voting.              From  |1988|1988_Oakland_Athletics_Season|  to  |1990|1990_Oakland_Athletics_Season| , McGwire followed with 32, 33, and 39 home runs, respectively, becoming the first Major Leaguer to hit 30+ home runs in each of his first four full seasons.  On July 3 and 4, 1988, he hit game-winning home runs in the 16th inning of both games.   Through May 2009, McGwire was tied for third all-time with  |Joe_DiMaggio|Joe_Dimaggio|  in home runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues , behind  |Chuck_Klein|Chuck_Klein|  and  |Ryan_Braun|Ryan_Braun|  .      McGwires most famous home run with the As was likely his game-winning solo shot in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 of the  |1988_World_Series|1988_World_Series|  against the  |Los_Angeles_Dodgers|1988_Los_Angeles_Dodgers_Season|  and former As  |closer|Closer| |_Jay_Howell|Jay_Howell| .  McGwires game-winner brought the As their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in five games; however, McGwire and his fellow  |Bash_Brother|Bash_Brother| ,  |José_Canseco|José_Canseco| , played a large part in the 1989 championship club that defeated the  |San_Francisco_Giants|1989_San_Francisco_Giants_Season|  in the famous  |Earthquake_Series|1989_World_Series|  .      Working diligently on his defense at first base, McGwire bristled at the notion that he was a one-dimensional player. He was generally regarded as a good fielder in his early years, even winning a  |Gold_Glove_Award|Gold_Glove_Award|  in  |1990|1990_Major_League_Baseball_Season|  – the only one that  |New_York_Yankees|New_York_Yankees|  legend  |Don_Mattingly|Don_Mattingly|  would not win between  |1985|1985_Major_League_Baseball_Season|  and  |1994|1994_Major_League_Baseball_Season| . In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense; however, McGwires batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .231, and .235 from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers.  |Manager|List_Of_Oakland_Athletics_Managers| |_Tony_La_Russa|Tony_La_Russa|  sat him out the final game of the  |season|1991_Oakland_Athletics_Season|  to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high  |bases_on_balls|Bases_On_Balls|  totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average.     McGwire stated in an interview with  Sports Illustrated  that 1991 was the worst year of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he didnt lift a weight that entire season. With all that behind him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.            The new look McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 , and put on a home run hitting show at the  |Home_Run_Derby|Home_Run_Derby|  during the  |1992_All_Star_break|1992_Major_League_Baseball_All_Star_Game| . His performance propelled the  |As|1992_Oakland_Athletics_Season|  to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The As lost in the  |playoffs|1992_American_League_Championship_Series|  to the eventual  |World_Series|1992_World_Series|  champion, the  |Toronto_Blue_Jays|1992_Toronto_Blue_Jays_Season| .     Foot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in  |1993|1993_Oakland_Athletics_Season|  and  |1994|1994_Oakland_Athletics_Season| , and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in  |1995|1995_Oakland_Athletics_Season| , but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In  |1996|1996_Oakland_Athletics_Season| , McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on-base percentage.     McGwires total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine  |American_League|American_League|  All-Star Teams while playing for the As, including six consecutive appearances from  |1987|1987_Major_League_Baseball_All_Star_Game|  through  |1992|1992_Major_League_Baseball_All_Star_Game| . He was one of only four players to hit a ball over the roof in the left field of  |Tiger_Stadium|Tiger_Stadium| . The Final Season, p.90, Tom Stanton, Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martins Press, New York, 2001,             On July 31, having already amassed 34 home runs to this point in the  |1997_season|1997_In_Baseball| , McGwire was traded from the  |Oakland_Athletics|1997_Oakland_Athletics_Season|  to the  |St_Louis_Cardinals|1997_St_Louis_Cardinals_Season|  for  |T_J_Mathews|T_J_Mathews| ,  |Eric_Ludwick|Eric_Ludwick|  and  |Blake_Stein|Blake_Stein| .  Despite playing just two-thirds of the season in the American League, he finished ninth in home runs. In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting average, 24 home runs, and 42 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage , fourth in OPS , fifth in OPS+ , tenth in RBI , and ninth in walks . He placed 16th in the NL MVP voting.     It was the last year of his contract, so there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged  |Jim_Edmonds|Jim_Edmonds| , another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.         As the  |1998_season|1998_St_Louis_Cardinals_Season|  progressed, it became clear that McGwire,  |Seattle_Mariners|1998_Seattle_Mariners_Season|  outfielder  |Ken_Griffey_Jr_|Ken_Griffey_Jr_| , and  |Chicago_Cubs|1998_Chicago_Cubs_Season|  outfielder  |Sammy_Sosa|Sammy_Sosa|  were all on track to break  |Roger_Mariss|Roger_Maris|  single-season home run record.  |The_race_to_break_the_record|1998_Major_League_Baseball_Home_Run_Record_Chase|  first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire; however, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.     On September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs  |Steve_Trachsel|Steve_Trachsel|  over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at  |Busch_Stadium|Busch_Memorial_Stadium| . The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Mariss family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.     McGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs , four ahead of Sosas 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by  |Barry_Bonds|Barry_Bonds|  with 73.     McGwire was honored with the inaugural  |Babe_Ruth_Home_Run_Award|Babe_Ruth_Home_Run_Award|  for leading Major League Baseball in home runs.  Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the  |playoffs|1998_National_League_Division_Series|  . Many credited the Sosa-McGwire home run chase in 1998 with saving baseball , by both bringing in new, younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by the  |1994–95_Major_League_Baseball_strike|1994–95_Major_League_Baseball_Strike| .        McGwire kept his high level of offensive production from 1998 going in  |1999|1999_St_Louis_Cardinals_Season|  while setting or extending several significant records. For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in home runs with 65. It was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 home runs, extending his own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 home runs in 1999, again trailed McGwire. Thus, they became the first, and still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 1996 to 1999. In 1999, he drove in an NL-leading 147 runs while only having 145 hits, the highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history.     Statistically in 2000 and 2001, McGwires numbers declined relative to previous years as he struggled to avoid injury . He retired after the 2001 season.           After his playing career ended, McGwire demonstrated coaching ability, personally assisting players such as  |Matt_Holliday|Matt_Holliday| ,  |Bobby_Crosby|Bobby_Crosby|  and  |Skip_Schumaker|Skip_Schumaker|  before accepting an official role as hitting coach with an MLB team. On October 26, 2009,  |Tony_La_Russa|Tony_La_Russa| , then  |manager|List_Of_St_Louis_Cardinals_Managers|  of the Cardinals, confirmed that McGwire would become the clubs fifth  |hitting_coach|List_Of_St_Louis_Cardinals_Coaches|  of his tenure with the Cardinals, replacing  |Hal_McRae|Hal_Mcrae| .  McGwire received a standing ovation prior to the Cardinals home opener on April 12, 2010.  In his three seasons as Cardinals hitting coach, they featured a prolific offense that led the National League in hitting and on-base percentage, and were second in runs.      In early November, 2012, McGwire rejected a contract extension to return as Cardinals hitting coach for the 2013 season. Instead, he accepted an offer for the same position with the  |Los_Angeles_Dodgers|Los_Angeles_Dodgers| ,  in order to be closer to his wife and five children.      On June 11, 2013, McGwire was  |ejected|Ejection|  for the first time as a coach during a  |bench_clearing_brawl|Bench_Clearing_Brawl|  with the  |Arizona_Diamondbacks|Arizona_Diamondbacks| .  . Close Call Sports/Umpire Ejection Fantasy League. June 12, 2013. He was suspended for two games starting the next day.     On December 2, 2015, he was named the new bench coach for the  |San_Diego_Padres|San_Diego_Padres| . He left the team after the 2018 season.        Known as one of the top sluggers of his era, McGwire ended his career with 583 home runs, which was fifth-most in history when he retired. When he hit his 500th career home run in 1999, he did so in 5,487 career at bats, the fewest in major league history. He led all MLB in home runs in five different seasons, including 1987 and each season from 1996 to 1999. Totaling 245 home runs from 1996−99, it was the highest four-season home run output in major league history. Further, in each of those four seasons, he exceeded 50 home runs, becoming the first player to do so. He was also the first player to hit 49 or more home runs five times, including his rookie-season record of 49 in 1987. With a career average of one home every 10.61 at-bats, he holds the MLB record for most home runs per at-bat by over a full at-bat more than second-place Babe Ruth .     As of 2015, McGwire owned three of the four lowest single-season AB/HR ratios in MLB history, which covered his 1996, 1998 and 1999 seasons. They were actually the top three seasons in MLB history until Bonds broke his single-season HR record in 2001. McGwires 1997 season ranked 13th.  Considered one of the slowest running players in the game, McGwire had the fewest career triples of any player with 5,000 or more at-bats, and had just 12 stolen bases while being caught stealing eight times.         In 1999,  The Sporting News  released a list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, ranking McGwire at number 91. The list had been compiled during the  |1998_season|1998_In_Baseball|  and included statistics through the  |1997_season|1997_In_Baseball| . That year, he was elected to the  |Major_League_Baseball_All_Century_Team|Major_League_Baseball_All_Century_Team| . In 2005, The Sporting News published an update of their list, and McGwire had been moved up to Number 84.     McGwire first became eligible for  |Hall_of_Fame|National_Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame_Museum|  voting in 2007. For election, a player needs to be listed on 75% of ballots cast; falling under 5% removes a player from future consideration. Between 2007 and 2010 McGwires performance held steady, receiving 128 votes in  |2007|Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame_Balloting_2007| , 128 votes in  |2008|Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame_Balloting_2008| , 118 votes in  |2009|Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame_Balloting_2009| , and 128 votes in  |2010|Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame_Balloting_2010| . The subsequent ballot in  |2011|Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame_Balloting_2011|  showed the first sub-20% total of 115 votes , and McGwires total votes continued to decline  until he was finally eliminated after receiving only 54 votes in  |2016|Baseball_Hall_Of_Fame_Balloting_2016| .      A portion of  |Interstate_70_in_Missouri|Interstate_70_In_Missourist_Louis|  in St. Louis and near Busch Stadium was named Mark McGwire Highway to honor his 70 home run achievement, along with his various good works for the city. In May 2010, St. Louis politicians succeeded in passing a state bill to change the name of Mark McGwire Highway , a 5-mile stretch of Interstate 70, to Mark Twain Highway .             † – tied with Sammy Sosa      †† – tied with Babe Ruth and Sammy Sosa          In 16 seasons playing major league baseball , McGwire accumulated the following career totals:        |G|Games_Played|  1,874    |ABs|At_Bat|  6,187    |Runs|Run|  1,167    |Hits|Hit|  1,626    |Doubles|Double|  252    |Triples|Triple|  6    |HR|Home_Run|  583    |RBI|Runs_Batted_In|  1,414    |GIDP|Grounded_Into_Double_Play|  147    |BB|Base_On_Balls|  1,317    |IBB|Intentional_Walk|  150     |HBP|Hit_By_Pitch|  75    |SH|Sacrifice_Bunt|  3    |SF|Sacrifice_Fly|  78    |Strikeouts|Strikeout|  1,596    |SBs|Stolen_Base|  12    |CS|Caught_Stealing|  8    |BA|Batting_Average|  .263    |OBP|On_Base_Percentage|  .394    |SLG|Slugging_Percentage|  .588    |OPS|On_Base_Plus_Slugging|  .982    |OPS_|Ops_Adjusted_Ops|  162            In a 1998 article by  |Associated_Press|Associated_Press|  writer  |Steve_Wilstein|Steve_Wilstein| , McGwire confessed to taking  |androstenedione|Androstenedione| ,  an over-the-counter muscle enhancement product that had already been banned by the  |World_Anti_Doping_Agency|World_Anti_Doping_Agency| , the  |NFL|National_Football_League| , and the  |IOC|International_Olympic_Committee| ; however, use of the substance was not prohibited by  |Major_League_Baseball|Major_League_Baseball|  at the time, and it was not federally classified as an anabolic steroid in the United States until 2004.  & docidf:s2195enr.txt.pdf      |Jose_Canseco|Jose_Canseco|  released a book,  Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big , in 2005. In it, he wrote positively about steroids and made various claims—among them, that McGwire had used performance-enhancing drugs since the 1980s and that Canseco had personally injected him with them.     In 2005, McGwire and Canseco were among 11 baseball players and executives subpoenaed to testify at a congressional hearing on steroids. During his testimony on March 17, 2005, McGwire declined to answer questions under oath when he appeared before the  |House_Government_Reform_Committee|House_Government_Reform_Committee| . In a tearful opening statement, McGwire said:        On January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted to  |using_steroids|Banned_Substances_In_Baseball_In_The_United_States|  on and off for a decade and said, I wish I had never touched steroids. It was foolish and it was a mistake. I truly apologize. Looking back, I wish I had never played during the steroid era.  He admitted using them in the 1989/90 offseason and then after he was injured in 1993. He admitted using them on occasion throughout the 1990s, including during the 1998 season. McGwire said that he used steroids to recover from injuries.      McGwires decision to admit using steroids was prompted by his decision to become hitting coach of the St. Louis Cardinals. According to McGwire, he took steroids for health reasons rather than to improve performance; however, a drug dealer who claimed to have provided steroids to McGwire asserted that his use was to improve his size and strength, rather than to just maintain his health.
