Pratchetts Discworld novels have led to dedicated conventions, the first in Manchester in 1996,  then worldwide,  often with the author as guest of honour.  Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book signing tour;  queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as the author continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time. His fans were not restricted by age or gender, and he received a large amount of fan mail from them. Pratchett enjoyed meeting fans and hearing what they think about his books, saying that since he was well paid for his novels, his fans were everything to him.        Pratchett said that to write, you must read extensively, both inside and outside your chosen genre  and to the point of overflow . He advised that writing is hard work, and that writers must make grammar, punctuation and spelling a part of your life. However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as an unavoidable consequence , rather than the reason for writing.        Although during his early career he wrote for the sci-fi and horror genres, Pratchett later focused almost entirely on fantasy, and said: It is easier to bend the universe around the story.  In the acceptance speech for his Carnegie Medal he said: Fantasy isnt just about wizards and silly wands. Its about seeing the world from new directions , pointing to J. K. Rowlings  Harry Potter  novels and J. R. R. Tolkiens  The Lord of the Rings . In the same speech, he acknowledged benefits of these works for the genre.
