   Located in  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| ,  |Moldova|Moldova|  is bordered on the west and southwest by  |Romania|Romania|  and on the north, south, and east by  |Ukraine|Ukraine| . Most of its territory lies between the areas two main rivers, the  |Nistru|Nistru|  and the  |Prut|Prut| . The Nistru forms a small part of Moldovas border with Ukraine in the northeast and southeast, but it mainly flows through the eastern part of the country, separating  |Bessarabia|Bessarabia|  and  |Transnistria|Transnistria| . The  |Prut_River|Prut_River|  forms Moldovas entire western boundary with Romania. The  |Danube|Danube|  touches the Moldovan border at its southernmost tip, and forms the border for .              Moldovas proximity to the  |Black_Sea|Black_Sea|  gives it a mild and sunny climate.     Moldovas  |climate|Climate|  is moderately continental: the summers are warm and long, with temperatures averaging about , and the winters are relatively mild and dry, with January temperatures averaging . Annual rainfall, which ranges from around  in the north to  in the south, can vary greatly; long dry spells are not unusual. The heaviest rainfall occurs in early summer and again in October; heavy showers and thunderstorms are common. Because of the irregular terrain, heavy summer rains often cause erosion and river silting.     Weather records.   The highest temperature ever recorded:  on July 21, 2007 .   The lowest temperature ever recorded:  on January 20, 1963 .     Chişinăus climate.        Bălțis climate.        Tiraspols climate.        Cahuls climate.                Most of Moldovas territory is a moderate hilly plateau cut deeply by many streams and rivers. Geologically, Moldova lies primarily on deep sedimentary rock that gives way to harder crystalline outcroppings only in the north. Moldovas hills are part of the  |Moldavian_Plateau|Moldavian_Plateau| , which geologically originate from the  |Carpathian_Mountains|Carpathian_Mountains| .     The northern landscape of Moldova is characterized by gently rolling uplands of the  |Dniester_Hills|Dniester_Hills|   interlaced with small flat plains in the valleys of the numerous  |creeks|Stream|  . These hills, which have an average altitude of  and a maximum altitude of , can be divided into the  |Northern_Moldavian_Hills|Northern_Moldavian_Hills|  and the  |Dniester_Ridge|Dniester_Ridge| , and continue further occupying the northern part of the  |Chernivtsi_oblast|Chernivtsi_Oblast|  in  |Ukraine|Ukraine| . The eastern slopes of the Dniester Ridge , form the high right bank of the Dniester River.     The  |Moldavian_Plain|Moldavian_Plain|  has an average of  and a maximum altitude of , and can be divided into the  |Bălți_Steppe|Bălți_Steppe|  and the  |Middle_Prut_Valley|Middle_Prut_Valley| . Originally  |forest|Forest| ed, it has been extensively de-forested for  |agriculture|Agriculture|  during the 19th and 20th centuries. In contrast to the region to the north and south, which is smore slant, this area is referred to as plain, although it has  |relief|Terrain|  very different from that of a flatland, and vegetation different from that of the  |steppe|Steppe| .      The hills of central Moldova, the  |Central_Moldavian_Plateau|Central_Moldavian_Plateau| , at an average elevation of about , are ridges interlaced by deep, flat valleys, ravines, and landslide-scoured depressions. Steep forest-clad slopes account for much of the terrain, where the most common trees are hornbeam, oak, linden, maple, wild pear, and wild cherry. The term  Codri  refers more generally to all the forests between the Carpathians and the  |Dniester|Dniester|  river, and even more generally to all forests in the area of the  |Carpathians|Carpathians| , yet since in Moldova most of them were preserved in the central part, Codri sometimes can colloquially refer to the remaining forests in the hills west and north of  |Chişinău|Chişinău| . The Dniester Ridge border Central Moldavian Plateau to the north along the river  |Răut|Răut| .     The plateau can be divided into 5 parts:  |Ciuluc-Soloneţ_Hills|Ciuluc-Soloneţ_Hills|  , elongated in the north along the right side of the  |Răut_river|Răut_River| , ,  |Corneşti_Hills|Corneşti_Hills|  , also known as Cordi Hills , ,  |Lower_Dniester_Hills|Lower_Dniester_Hills|  , elongated to the south of the Botna river, ,  |Tigheci_Hills|Tigheci_Hills|  , elongated in the south along the left side of the  |Prut_river|Prut_River| , , and between the latter and the Prut river, the  |Lower_Prut_Valley|Lower_Prut_Valley|  , .     The countrys highest point,  |Bălăneşti_Hill|Bălăneşti_Hill| , which reaches , depending on the source, is situated in the Corneşti Hills, the western part of the Central Moldavian Plateau. Northwest of it are the  |Ciuluc-Soloneţ_Hills|Ciuluc-Soloneţ_Hills|  . In the south, the  |Tigheci_Hills|Tigheci|   are a prolongation, and run to the south parallel to the Lower Prut Valley.     To the south-east, the southern part of the Central Moldavian Plateau, which averages , max , and has numerous ravines and gullies, gradually vanishs into the extensive Bugeac Plain, with most of the  |Budjak|Budjak|  region already in Ukraine.      |Transnistria|Transnistria|  has spurs of the  |Podolian_Plateau|Podolian_Plateau|  , , which are cut into by tributaries of the Dniester River. The southern half of Transnistria, the Lower Dniester Plain, can be regarded as the western end of the  |Eurasian_steppe|Eurasian_Steppe| , and has an average elevation of , with a maximum of . The high right bank and low left bank of the Dniester are in sharp contrast here, where visibility is not impeded by forests.     About 75 percent of Moldova is covered by a soil type called  |black_earth|Chernozem|  or  |chernozem|Chernozem| . In the northern hills, more clay textured soils are found; in the south, red-earth soil is predominant. The soil becomes less fertile toward the south but can still support grape and sunflower production. The hills have woodland soils, while a small portion in southern Moldova is in the  |steppe|Steppe|  zone, although most steppe areas today are cultivated. The lower reaches of the Prut and Dniester rivers and the southern river valleys are saline marshes.     Drainage in Moldova is to the south, toward the Black Sea lowlands, and eventually into the Black Sea, but only eight rivers and creeks extend more than 100 kilometers. Moldovas main river, the  |Dniester|Dniester| , is navigable throughout almost the entire country, and in warmer winters it does not freeze over. The  |Prut|Prut|  river is a tributary of the  |Danube|Danube| , which it joins at the far southwestern tip of the country. Over 95% of the water circulation in Moldova flows into one of the two rivers - the Prut or Dniester. Of Moldovas well-developed network of about 3,000 creeks and streams, all draining south to the Black Sea, only 246 exceed  in length, and only 8 exceed .     Underground water, extensively used for the countrys water supply, includes about 2,200 natural springs. The terrain favours construction of reservoirs of various size.         |Dniester_River|Dniester_River| |Dealul_Bălăneşti|Bălăneşti_Hill| |Naslavcea|Naslavcea| |Giurgiuleşti|Giurgiuleşti| |Criva|Criva,_Briceni| |Palanca|Palanca,_Ştefan_Vodă|              Moldovas natural habitat is characterized by  |forest_steppes|Forest_Steppe| , a temperate-climate habitat type composed of  |grassland|Grassland|  interspersed with areas of  |woodland|Woodland|  or  |forest|Forest| . A belt of forest steppes cross  |Eurasia|Eurasia|  from eastern Europe to Eastern Siberia, forming a transition between  |temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forests|Temperate_Broadleaf_And_Mixed_Forests|  and  |temperate_grasslands|Temperate_Grasslands| . In the 19th century Moldova witnessed a sharp decrease in the forested areas, sacrificed for agriculture due to rich soil.                       |Herodotus|Herodotus|  visited the countryside between the rivers Dnister and Prut and described the place as a plain with deep black earth, rich in grass and well irrigated .   Lithuanian Prince  |Jogaila|Jogaila|  spoke of  |Moldavia|Moldavia|  as a rich and fructiferous country .   According to the testimony of  |Venetian_Mateus_de_Murano|Venetian_Mateus_De_Murano| , the country was very well located, reach with cattle and all kinds of fruits, pastures are perfect .   Rich natural resources of Moldavia always attracted nomads. Fleeing their devastating incursions, inhabitants of Moldavia left the brooded places and hid in forests. French knight  |Guilbert_de_Lannoy|Guilbert_De_Lannoy| , who visited these places in 1421, has mentioned insignificant population of the region: we moved through large deserts .   Counsellor of Hungarian King  |George_Reihersdorf|George_Reihersdorf|  was complaining of travel through empty, uninhabited lands . In 1541, he produced the first geographical map of the  |Principality_of_Moldavia|Principality_Of_Moldavia| , with rivers  |Dnister|Dnister|  and  |Prut|Prut|  shown, as well as cities and other localities, but also highlighted large steppes.   A map of Moldavia was drawn by the German diplomat  |Sigismund_von_Herberstein|Sigismund_Von_Herberstein| . On his map one can see woodless spaces -  |Bălți_steppe|Bălți_Steppe|  in the north, and  |Bugeac_Steppe|Bugeac_Steppe|  in the south.   In the 17th century, pilgrims  |Pavel_Aleppskii|Pavel_Aleppskii|  and  |Ioan_Lukianov|Ioan_Lukianov|  traveled on their way to the  |Holy_land|Holy_Land|  through Moldavia. These two travellers were struck by the disastrous state of the land that used to blossom: It better be not ravaged, as no other such can be found, it may yield any kind .   English traveller  |John_Bell|John_Bell| , who also visited Moldavia, and wrote about fecund soils and small nice towns situated next to  |Răut|Răut| .   Russian geographer  |K._Laksman|K._Laksman|  described Bălți steppe in the beginning of the 19th century: To the north is located a steppe with almost no trees at all. To the north-west the steppe is not as woodless .   Scientist  |K._Arseniev|K._Arseniev|  mentioned that the north of  |Bessarabia|Bessarabia|  is a genuine mix of arid steppes with most fertile pastures, rich meadows and gardens .   Travelers and scholars were amazed by the contrast between rich natural resources of Moldavia/Bălți steppe and its low population in war torned 18th century, pitiful state of agriculture, as well as the poverty of the local population.   Desert, waste, naked steppe... The settling among limitless expanses of Bălți steppe happened not in accordnace with logic, but against it. The life of remote ancestors of Bălțiers was full of difficulties and crosses, but they managed to resist.   |Dimitrie_Cantemir|Dimitrie_Cantemir| ,  Descriptio Moldaviae  |Constantin_Stamati-Ciurea|Constantin_Stamati-Ciurea| including  |DDT|Ddt| .
