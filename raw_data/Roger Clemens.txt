Clemens for all of his career was a prototypical  |power_pitcher|Power_Pitcher|  with an aggressive edge. This was especially the case when he was a young man, when Clemens threw two pitches: a 98-mph  |fastball|Fastball|  and a hard  |breaking_ball|Breaking_Ball| . At 23, Clemens simply reared back and threw the ball past batters.  Later in his career, Clemens developed a devastating  |split_finger_fastball|Split_Finger_Fastball|  to use as an off-speed pitch in concert with his fastball.  Clemens has jocularly referred to this pitch as Mr. Splitty.       By the time Clemens retired from Major League Baseball in 2007, his  |four_seam_fastball|Four_Seam_Fastball|  had settled in the 91–94  mph range. He also threw a  |two_seam_fastball|Two_Seam_Fastball| , a  |slider|Slider|  in the mid 80s, his hard splitter, and an occasional  |curveball|Curveball| .  Clemens was a highly durable pitcher, leading the American League in  |complete_games|Complete_Game|  three times and  |innings_pitched|Innings_Pitched|  twice. His 18 complete games in 1987 is more than any pitcher has thrown since.  Clemens was also known as a strikeout pitcher, leading the AL in Ks five times and  |strikeouts_per_nine_innings|Strikeouts_Per_Nine_Innings|  three times.       Clemens has been the focal point of several controversies. His reputation has always been that of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in , but he was among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career and subsequently tapered off. After the  |2000_ALCS_game|2000_American_League_Championship_Series|  against the Mariners where he knocked down future teammate  |Alex_Rodriguez|Alex_Rodriguez|  and then argued with him,  |Seattle_Mariners|Seattle_Mariners|  manager  |Lou_Piniella|Lou_Piniella|  called Clemens a headhunter.  His beaning earlier that year of  |Mike_Piazza|Mike_Piazza| , followed by throwing a broken-bat in Piazzas direction in the  |2000_World_Series|2000_World_Series| , cemented Clemens surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many.

Clemens was ranked 9th all-time in hit batsmen after the 2007 season.      Clemens has attracted controversy over the years for his outspoken comments, such as his complaints about having to carry his own luggage through an airport and his criticism of  |Fenway_Park|Fenway_Park|  for being a subpar facility.

Toward the end of his career, his annual on-and-off retirements revived a reputation for  |diva|Diva| -like behavior.      Clemens has received criticism for receiving special treatment from the teams that sign him. While playing for Houston, Clemens was not obliged to travel with the team on road trips if he was not pitching. His 2007 contract with the New York Yankees had a family plan clause that stipulated that he not be required to go on road trips in which he was not scheduled to pitch and allowed him to leave the team between starts to be with his family. These perks were publicly criticized by Yankee reliever  |Kyle_Farnsworth|Kyle_Farnsworth| .  Most of Clemens teammates, however, did not complain of such perks because of Clemens success on the mound and valuable presence in the clubhouse. Yankee teammate  |Jason_Giambi|Jason_Giambi|  spoke for such players when he said, Id carry his bags for him, just as long as he is on the mound.       Steroid use accusations  |José_Cansecos|José_Canseco|  book,  Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big , Canseco suggested that Clemens had expert knowledge about steroids and suggested that he used steroids, based on the improvement in his performance after leaving the Red Sox. While not addressing the allegations directly, Clemens stated: I could care less about the rules and Ive talked to some friends of his and Ive teased them that when youre under house arrest and have ankle bracelets on, you have a lot of time to write a book.       |Jason_Grimsley|Jason_Grimsley|  named Clemens, as well as  |Andy_Pettitte|Andy_Pettitte| , as a user of  |performance_enhancing_drugs|Performance_Enhancing_Drugs| . According to a 20-page search warrant affidavit signed by IRS Special Agent  |Jeff_Novitzky|Jeff_Novitzky| , Grimsley told investigators he obtained amphetamines, anabolic steroids and human growth hormone from someone recommended to him by former Yankees trainer  |Brian_McNamee|Brian_Mcnamee| . McNamee was a personal strength coach for Clemens and Pettitte, hired by Clemens in 1998.  At the time of the Grimsley revelations, McNamee denied knowledge of steroid use by Clemens and Pettitte.  ESPN.com, November 14, 2006 Despite initial media reports, the affidavit made no mention of Clemens or Pettitte.  ESPN.com, November 14, 2006     However, Clemenss name was mentioned 82 times in the  |Mitchell_Report|Mitchell_Report|  on steroid use in baseball.  MSNBC.com In the report, McNamee stated that during the , , and  baseball seasons, he injected Clemens with  |Winstrol|Stanozolol| . Clemens attorney Rusty Hardin denied the claims, calling McNamee a troubled and unreliable witness who has changed his story five times in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution. He noted that Clemens has never tested positive in a steroid test.  Former U.S. Senator  |George_Mitchell|George_J_Mitchell| , who prepared the report, stated that he relayed the allegations to each athlete implicated in the report and gave them a chance to respond before his findings were published.     On January 6, 2008, Clemens appeared on  60 Minutes  to address the allegations. He told  |Mike_Wallace|Mike_Wallace|  that his longevity in baseball was due to hard work rather than illegal substances and denied all of McNamees assertions that he injected Clemens with steroids, saying that they never happened .  CBSNews.com, January 6, 2008 On January 7, Clemens filed a defamation lawsuit against McNamee, claiming that the former trainer lied after being threatened with prosecution.  McNamees attorneys argued that McNamee was compelled to cooperate by federal officials and thus his statements were protected. A federal judge agreed, throwing out all claims related to McNamees statements to investigators on February 13, 2009, but allowing the case to proceed on statements McNamee made about Clemens to Pettitte.     On February 13, 2008, Clemens appeared before a Congressional committee, along with Brian McNamee, and swore under oath that he did not take steroids; that he did not discuss HGH with McNamee; that he was not at a party at José Cansecos where steroids were the topic of conversation; that he was only injected with B-12 and lidocaine; and that he never told Pettitte that he had taken HGH. This last point was in contradiction to testimony Pettitte had given under oath on February 4, 2008, wherein Pettitte said he repeated to McNamee a conversation Pettitte had with Clemens. During this conversation, Pettitte said Clemens had told him that McNamee had injected Clemens with human growth hormone. Pettitte said McNamee reacted angrily, saying that Clemens shouldnt have done that.  |Quinn_T_J_|T_J_Quinn| .   ESPN.com ,   December 12, 2008. Retrieved November 6, 2017.

In a letter sent out February 27 to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Henry Waxman and ranking Republican Tom Davis said Clemens testimony that he never used anabolic steroids or human growth hormone warrants further investigation .     As a result of the Mitchell Report, Clemens has been asked to end his involvement with the Giff Nielsen Day of Golf for Kids charity golf tournament in Houston that he has hosted for four years. As well, his name has been removed from the Houston-based Roger Clemens Institute for Sports Medicine; it will be renamed the Memorial Hermann Sports Medicine Institute. ESPN.com, December 27, 2008     After Washington prosecutors showed a renewed interest in the case in the final months of 2008 , a federal grand jury was convened in January 2009 to hear evidence of Clemens possible perjury before Congress. The grand jury indicted Clemens on August 19, 2010, on charges of making false statements to Congress about his use of performance-enhancing drugs. The indictment charges Clemens with one count of obstruction of Congress , three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury in connection with his February 2008 testimony.     His first trial began on July 13, 2011, but on the second day of testimony the judge in the case declared a mistrial over prosecutorial misconduct after prosecutors showed the jury prejudicial evidence they had been told not to show. Clemens was subsequently retried. The verdict from his second trial came in on June 18, 2012.
