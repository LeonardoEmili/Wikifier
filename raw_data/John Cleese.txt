He achieved success at the  |Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe|Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe|  and as a scriptwriter and performer on  The Frost Report . In the late 1960s, he co-founded  |Monty_Python|Monty_Python| , the comedy troupe responsible for the  |sketch_show|Sketch_Show|   Monty Pythons Flying Circus . Along with his Python co-stars  |Terry_Gilliam|Terry_Gilliam| ,  |Eric_Idle|Eric_Idle| ,  |Terry_Jones|Terry_Jones| ,  |Michael_Palin|Michael_Palin|  and  |Graham_Chapman|Graham_Chapman| , Cleese starred in Monty Python films, which include:  Monty Python and the Holy Grail  ,  Life of Brian  and  The Meaning of Life  .     In the mid-1970s, Cleese and his first wife,  |Connie_Booth|Connie_Booth| , co-wrote the sitcom  Fawlty Towers , and he starred in it as  |Basil_Fawlty|Basil_Fawlty| . The series resulted in Cleese receiving the 1980  |BAFTA_for_Best_Entertainment_Performance|British_Academy_Television_Award_For_Best_Entertainment_Performance| , and in 2000 the show topped the  |British_Film_Institutes|British_Film_Institute|  list of the  |100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes|100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes| . In a 2001  |Channel_4|Channel_4|  poll Basil was ranked second on their list of the  |100_Greatest_TV_Characters|100_Greatest| . Cleese co-starred with  |Kevin_Kline|Kevin_Kline| ,  |Jamie_Lee_Curtis|Jamie_Lee_Curtis| , and former Python colleague Michael Palin in  A Fish Called Wanda  and  Fierce Creatures  , both of which he also wrote; for A Fish Called Wanda, he was also nominated for the  |Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay|Academy_Award_For_Best_Original_Screenplay| . He has also starred in  Time Bandits  and  Rat Race  and has appeared in many other films, including  Silverado  ,  Mary Shelleys Frankenstein  , two  James Bond  films , two  Harry Potter  films , and three  Shrek  films.     Emerging from the  |Cambridge_Footlights|Cambridge_Footlights|  in the 1960s, Cleese specialises in  |satire|Satire| ,  |black_comedy|Black_Comedy| ,  |sketch_comedy|Sketch_Comedy|  and  |surreal_humour|Surreal_Humour| .  With  Yes Minister  writer  |Antony_Jay|Antony_Jay| , he co-founded  |Video_Arts|Video_Arts| , a production company making entertaining training films. In 1976, Cleese co-founded  The Secret Policemans Ball  benefit shows to raise funds for the human rights organisation  |Amnesty_International|Amnesty_International| . Although a long running supporter of the  |Liberal_Democrats|Liberal_Democrats| , in 1999 he turned down a  |life_peer|Life_Peer| age offer from the party.       Cleese was born in  |Weston-super-Mare|Weston-Super-Mare| , Somerset, the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese , an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn .  His familys surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it was embarrassing and used the name Cleese when he enlisted in the  |Army|British_Army|  during the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| ; he changed it officially by deed poll in 1923.   As a child, Cleese supported  |Bristol_City_FC|Bristol_City_Football_Club|  and  |Somerset_County_Cricket_Club|Somerset_County_Cricket_Club| .   Cleese was educated at St Peters Preparatory School , where he received a prize for  |English|English_Studies|  and did well at  |cricket|Cricket|  and  |boxing|Boxing| . When he was 13, he was awarded an  |exhibition|Exhibition|  at  |Clifton_College|Clifton_College| , an  |English_public_school|English_Public_School|  in Bristol. He was already more than 6  feet tall by then.     Cleese allegedly defaced the school grounds, as a prank, by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of  |Field_Marshal|Field_Marshal| |Earl_Haig|Douglas_Haig,_1St_Earl_Haig|  had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet.  Cleese played cricket in the First XI and did well academically, passing 8  |O-Levels|Gce_Ordinary_Level|  and 3  |A-Levels|Gce_Advanced_Level|  in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.   In his autobiography So, Anyway, he says that discovering, aged 17, he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook: It was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect  ... I believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world.     He could not go straight to  |Cambridge|University_Of_Cambridge| , as the ending of  |National_Service|Conscription_In_The_United_Kingdom|  meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places, so he returned to his prep school for two years From Fringe to Flying Circus  – Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960–1980  – Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980, . to teach science, English, geography, history, and Latin  . Life of Brian commentary by Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle He then took up a place he had won at  |Downing_College,_Cambridge|Downing_College,_Cambridge| , to read Law. He also joined the  |Cambridge_Footlights|Footlights| . He recalled that he went to the  |Cambridge_Guildhall|Cambridge_Guildhall| , where each university society had a stall, and went up to the Footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance. He replied no as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad, and if there was anything worse than his singing, it was his dancing. He was then asked Well, what do you do? to which he replied, I make people laugh.     At the Footlights theatrical club, he spent a lot of time with  |Tim_Brooke-Taylor|Tim_Brooke-Taylor|  and  |Bill_Oddie|Bill_Oddie|  and met his future writing partner  |Graham_Chapman|Graham_Chapman| . Cleese wrote extra material for the 1961 Footlights Revue I Thought I Saw It Move, Footlights!  – A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy  – Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983, . and was Registrar for the Footlights Club during 1962. He was also in the cast of the 1962 Footlights Revue Double Take! Cleese graduated from Cambridge in 1963 with a  |2:1|2:1| . Despite his successes on  The Frost Report , his father would send him cuttings from  The Daily Telegraph  offering management jobs in places like  |Marks_and_Spencer|Marks_And_Spencer| .  |Sunday_Times|Sunday_Times| , 16 October 1988.         Cleese was a scriptwriter, as well as a cast member, for the 1963  |Footlights_Revue|Cambridge_Footlights_Revue|  A Clump of Plinths. The revue was so successful at the  |Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe|Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe|  that it was renamed  Cambridge Circus  and taken to the  |West_End|West_End_Theatre|  in London and then on a tour of New Zealand and Broadway, with the cast also appearing in some of the revues sketches on  The Ed Sullivan Show  in October 1964.     After Cambridge Circus, Cleese briefly stayed in America, performing  |on|Broadway_Theatre|  and  |off-Broadway|Off-Broadway| . While performing in the musical  Half a Sixpence , Cleese met future Python  |Terry_Gilliam|Terry_Gilliam| , as well as American actress Connie Booth, whom he married on 20 February 1968. At their wedding at a Unitarian Church in Manhattan, the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language. The only moment of disappointment, Cleese recalled, came at the very end of the service when I discovered that Id failed to excise one particular mention of the word God. Cleese, John . New York: Crown Archetype, p. 318. Later Booth would become a writing partner.     He was soon offered work as a writer with  |BBC_Radio|Bbc_Radio| , where he worked on several programmes, most notably as a sketch writer for  The Dick Emery Show . The success of the Footlights Revue led to the recording of a short series of half-hour radio programmes, called  Im Sorry, Ill Read That Again , which were so popular that the BBC commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from 1965 to 1974. Cleese returned to Britain and joined the cast. In many episodes, he is credited as John Otto Cleese . P70, The Authorised History of Im Sorry I Havent A Clue; Jem Roberts      Also in 1965, Cleese and Chapman began writing on  The Frost Report . The writing staff chosen for The Frost Report consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy.  They included co-performers from Im Sorry, Ill Read That Again and future  |Goodies|The_Goodies| |Bill_Oddie|Bill_Oddie|  and  |Tim_Brooke-Taylor|Tim_Brooke-Taylor| , and also  |Frank_Muir|Frank_Muir| ,  |Barry_Cryer|Barry_Cryer| ,  |Marty_Feldman|Marty_Feldman| ,  |Ronnie_Barker|Ronnie_Barker| ,  |Ronnie_Corbett|Ronnie_Corbett| ,  |Dick_Vosburgh|Dick_Vosburgh|  and future Python members  |Eric_Idle|Eric_Idle| ,  |Terry_Jones|Terry_Jones| , and  |Michael_Palin|Michael_Palin| .   While working on The Frost Report, the future Pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant. Cleeses and Chapmans sketches often involved authority figures, some of whom were performed by Cleese, while Jones and Palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas. Idle was one of those charged with writing  |David_Frosts|David_Frost|  monologue. During this period Cleese met and befriended influential British comedian  |Peter_Cook|Peter_Cook| .     It was as a performer on The Frost Report that Cleese achieved his breakthrough on British television as a comedy actor, appearing as the tall, patrician figure in the classic  Class sketch , contrasting comically in a line-up with the shorter, middle class  |Ronnie_Barker|Ronnie_Barker|  and the even shorter, working class  |Ronnie_Corbett|Ronnie_Corbett| . The British Film Institute commented, Its twinning of height and social position, combined with a minimal script, created a classic TV moment.  This series was so popular that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on  At Last the 1948 Show , during which time the  Four Yorkshiremen sketch  was written by all four writers/performers .  Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of  Doctor in the House  . These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered their very own series. However, owing to Chapmans alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was, therefore, unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them. He had found working with Palin on The Frost Report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series. Palin had previously been working on  Do Not Adjust Your Set  with Idle and Jones, with Terry Gilliam creating the animations. The four of them had, on the back of the success of Do Not Adjust Your Set, been offered a series for  |Thames_Television|Thames_Television| , which they were waiting to begin when Cleeses offer arrived. Palin agreed to work with Cleese and Chapman in the meantime, bringing with him Gilliam, Jones, and Idle.           Monty Pythons Flying Circus ran for four seasons from October 1969 to December 1974 on  |BBC_Television|Bbc_Television| , though Cleese quit the show after the third. Cleeses two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressed-out loony. He portrayed the former as a series of announcers, TV show hosts, and government officials . The latter is perhaps best represented in the  |Cheese_Shop|Cheese_Shop_Sketch|  and by Cleeses  |Mr_Praline|Mr_Praline|  character, the man with a  |dead_Norwegian_Blue_parrot|Dead_Parrot_Sketch|  and a menagerie of other animals all named Eric . He was also known for his working class Sergeant Major character, who worked as a Police Sergeant, Roman Centurion, etc. Cleese also appeared during some abrupt scene changes where he would come in as a radio commentator and, in a rather pompous manner, make the formal and determined announcement And now for something completely different , which later became the title of  |the_first_Monty_Python_film|And_Now_For_Something_Completely_Different| .             Along with Gilliams animations, Cleeses work with Graham Chapman provided Python with its darkest and angriest moments, and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of  |Basil_Fawlty|Basil_Fawlty| .     Unlike Palin and Jones, Cleese and Chapman wrote together in the same room; Cleese claims that their writing partnership involved him doing most of the work, while Chapman sat back, not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level. A classic example of this is the  |Dead_Parrot_sketch|Dead_Parrot_Sketch|  , envisaged by Cleese as a satire on poor customer service, which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car . It was Chapmans suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot, and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a Norwegian Blue , giving the sketch a  |surreal|Surrealism|  air which made it far more memorable. McCabe, Bob . The Life of Graham, The authorised biography of Graham Chapman. pp. 90-91. London: Orion Books     Their humour often involved  |ordinary_people|Everyman|  in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason. Like Chapman, Cleeses  |poker_face|Deadpan| , clipped middle class accent, and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures, such as policemen, detectives, Nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine. Most famously, in the  |Ministry_of_Silly_Walks|The_Ministry_Of_Silly_Walks|  sketch , Cleese exploits his stature as the crane-legged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office. On the Silly Walks sketch, Ben Beaumont-Thomas in  The Guardian  writes, “Cleese is utterly deadpan as he takes the stereotypical  |bowler-hatted|Bowler_Hat|  political drone and ruthlessly skewers him. All the self-importance, bureaucratic inefficiency and laughable circuitousness of  |Whitehall|Whitehall|  is summed up in one balletic extension of his slender leg.”         Chapman and Cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, such as in the cheese shop , the dead parrot sketch and  |Argument_Clinic|Argument_Clinic|  , where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. Monty Python . The Complete Monty Pythons Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume 2. Pantheon Books. p. 86. All of these roles were opposite Palin —the comic contrast between the towering Cleeses crazed aggression and the shorter Palins shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese–Palin dynamic is reversed, as in  |Fish_Licence|Fish_Licence|  , wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.     Though Flying Circus lasted four series, by the start of series 3, Cleese was growing tired of dealing with Chapmans alcoholism. He felt, too, that the shows scripts had declined in quality. For these reasons, he became restless and decided to move on. Though he stayed for the third series, he officially left the group before the fourth season.  Cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions, though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series. He remained friendly with the group, and all six began writing  Monty Python and the Holy Grail . Much of his work on Holy Grail remains widely quoted, including the  |Black_Knight|Black_Knight|  scene.  Cleese returned to the troupe to co-write and co-star in two further Monty Python films,  Monty Pythons Life of Brian  and  Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life . His attack on Roman rule in Life of Brian – where he asks What have the Romans ever done for us? , before being met with a string of benefits including sanitation, roads and public order – was ranked the seventh funniest line in film in a 2002 poll.  Since the last Python film  Cleese has participated in various live performances with the group over the years.       From 1970 to 1973, Cleese served as  |rector_of_the_University_of_St_Andrews|Rector_Of_The_University_Of_St_Andrews| .  His election proved a milestone for the university, revolutionising and modernising the post. For instance, the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an Assessor , a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence. Cleese changed this into a position for a student, elected across campus by the student body, resulting in direct access and representation for the student body.      Around this time, Cleese worked with comedian  |Les_Dawson|Les_Dawson|  on his sketch/stand-up show  Sez Les . The differences between the two physically and socially  were marked, but both worked well together from series 8 onwards until the series ended in 1976.       In December 1977, Cleese appeared as a guest star on  The Muppet Show .  Cleese was a fan of the show and co-wrote much of the episode.  Cleese also made a cameo appearance in their 1981 film  The Great Muppet Caper  and won the  TV Times  award for Funniest Man on TV  – 1978–79.  In 1979, he starred in a TV special,  |To_Norway,_Home_of_Giants|To_Norway,_Home_Of_Giants| , produced by  |Johnny_Bergh|Johnny_Bergh| .     Throughout the 1970s, Cleese also produced and acted in a number of successful business training films, including  Meetings, Bloody Meetings , and  More Bloody Meetings . These were produced by his company  |Video_Arts|Video_Arts| . ,  The Independent , 5 January 1996     Fawlty Towers       Cleese achieved greater prominence in the United Kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager  |Basil_Fawlty|Basil_Fawlty|  in Fawlty Towers, which he co-wrote with his wife  |Connie_Booth|Connie_Booth| . The series won three  |BAFTA|Bafta|  awards when produced and in 2000, it topped the  |British_Film_Institutes|British_Film_Institute|  list of the  |100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes|100_Greatest_British_Television_Programmes| . In a 2001 poll conducted by  |Channel_4|Channel_4|  Basil Fawlty was ranked second  on their list of the  |100_Greatest_TV_Characters|100_Greatest| .   The series also featured  |Prunella_Scales|Prunella_Scales|  as Basils acerbic wife  |Sybil|Sybil_Fawlty| ,  |Andrew_Sachs|Andrew_Sachs|  as the much abused Spanish waiter  |Manuel|Manuel| , and Booth as waitress  |Polly|Polly_Sherman| , the series voice of sanity. Cleese based Basil Fawlty on a real person,  |Donald_Sinclair|Donald_Sinclair| , whom he had encountered in 1970 while the Monty Python team were staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in  |Torquay|Torquay|  while filming inserts for their television series. Reportedly, Cleese was inspired by Sinclairs mantra, I could run this hotel just fine if it werent for the guests. He later described Sinclair as the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met, although Sinclairs widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series. During the Pythons stay, Sinclair allegedly threw Idles briefcase out of the hotel in case it contained a bomb, complained about Gilliams American table manners, and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town.       The first series was screened from 19 September 1975 on  |BBC_2|Bbc_Two| , initially to poor reviews,  but gained momentum when repeated on  |BBC_1|Bbc_One|  the following year. Despite this, a second series did not air until 1979, by which time Cleeses marriage to Booth had ended, but they revived their collaboration for the second series. Fawlty Towers consisted of two seasons, each of only six episodes; Cleese and Booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series. The popularity of Fawlty Towers has endured, and in addition to featuring high in greatest ever television show polls it is often re-broadcast. Mattha Busby, April 9, 2019, . The Guardian, Retrieved 24 May 2019 In a 2002 poll, Basils “ |dont_mention_the_war|The_Germans| ” comment was ranked the second funniest line in television.       During the 1980s and 1990s, Cleese focused on film, though he did work with  |Peter_Cook|Peter_Cook|  in his one-off TV special Peter Cook and Co. in 1980. In the same year, Cleese played  |Petruchio|Petruchio| , in  |Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|   The Taming of the Shrew  in the  |BBC_Television_Shakespeare|Bbc_Television_Shakespeare|  series.

He also participated in  Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl  and starred in  The Secret Policemans Ball  for  |Amnesty_International|Amnesty_International| . In 1985, Cleese had a small dramatic role as a sheriff in  Silverado , which had an all-star cast that included  |Kevin_Kline|Kevin_Kline| , with whom he would star in  A Fish Called Wanda  three years later. In 1986, he starred in  Clockwise  as an uptight school headmaster obsessed with punctuality and constantly getting into trouble during a journey to speak at the  |Headmasters_Conference|Headmasters_Conference| .

In 1988, he wrote and starred in  A Fish Called Wanda  as the lead, Archie Leach, along with  |Jamie_Lee_Curtis|Jamie_Lee_Curtis| ,  |Kevin_Kline|Kevin_Kline| , and Michael Palin. Wanda was a commercial and critical success, and Cleese was nominated for an  |Academy_Award|Academy_Award|  for his script.  |Cynthia_Cleese|Cynthia_Cleese|  starred as Leachs daughter. Graham Chapman was diagnosed with  |throat_cancer|Esophageal_Cancer|  in 1989; Cleese, Michael Palin, Peter Cook, and Chapmans partner  |David_Sherlock|David_Sherlock| , witnessed Chapmans death. Chapmans death occurred a day before the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, with Jones commenting, the worst case of party-pooping in all history. Cleese gave a eulogy at Chapmans memorial service.       Cleese would later play a supporting role in  |Kenneth_Branaghs|Kenneth_Branagh|  adaptation of  Mary Shelleys Frankenstein  alongside Branagh himself and  |Robert_De_Niro|Robert_De_Niro| . With  |Robin_Skynner|Robin_Skynner| , the  |group_analyst|Group_Analysis|  and  |family_therapist|Family_Therapy| , Cleese wrote two books on relationships:  Families and How to Survive Them , and  Life and How to Survive It . The books are presented as a dialogue between Skynner and Cleese.     The follow-up to A Fish Called Wanda,  Fierce Creatures —which again starred Cleese alongside Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Palin—was released in 1997, but was greeted with mixed reception by critics and audiences. Cleese has since often stated that making the second film had been a mistake. When asked by his friend, director and restaurant critic  |Michael_Winner|Michael_Winner| , what he would do differently if he could live his life again, Cleese responded, I wouldnt have married  |Alyce_Faye_Eichelberger|Alyce_Faye_Eichelberger|  and I wouldnt have made Fierce Creatures.      In 1999, Cleese appeared in the  |James_Bond|James_Bond|  film,  The World Is Not Enough  as  |Qs|Q|  assistant, referred to by Bond as R .

In his Alimony Tour Cleese explained the origin of his fondness for  |black_humour|Black_Humour| , the only thing that he inherited from his mother. Examples of it are the  |Dead_Parrot_sketch|Dead_Parrot_Sketch| ,  |The_Kipper_and_the_Corpse|The_Kipper_And_The_Corpse|  episode of Fawlty Towers, his clip for the 1992 BBC2 mockumentary A Question of Taste , the  |Undertakers_sketch|Undertakers_Sketch| , and  |his_eulogy|Dead_Parrot_Sketchfurther_Uses|  at Graham Chapmans memorial service.

The cause that has been the most frequent and consistent beneficiary has been the human rights work of  |Amnesty_International|Amnesty_International|  via the  Secret Policemans Ball  benefit shows. The idea of the Ball was conceived by Cleese, with Huffington Post stating “in 1976 he “friended” the then-struggling Amnesty International first with a cheque signed “J. Cleese” — and then by rounding up “a few friends” to put on a show.” Many musicians have publicly attributed their activism—and the organisation of their own  |benefit_events|Benefit_Concert| —to the inspiration of the work in this field of Cleese and the rest of Python, such as  |Bob_Geldof|Bob_Geldof|  ,  |U2|U2| ,  |Pete_Townshend|Pete_Townshend| , and  |Sting|Sting| . . The Guardian.

Having previously been a  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  voter, Cleese switched to the  |SDP|Social_Democratic_Party|  after their formation in 1981. During the  |1987_general_election|1987_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Cleese recorded a nine-minute party political broadcast for the  |SDP–Liberal_Alliance|Sdp–Liberal_Alliance| , which spoke about the similarities and failures of the other two parties in a more humorous tone than standard political broadcasts. Cleese has since appeared in broadcasts for the Liberal Democrats, in the  |1997_general_election|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  and narrating a radio election broadcast for the party during the  |2001_general_election|2001_United_Kingdom_General_Election| .

In 2011, Cleese declared his appreciation for Britains coalition government between the  |Conservatives|Conservative_Party|  and Liberal Democrats, saying: I think whats happening at the moment is rather interesting. The Coalition has made everything a little more courteous and a little more flexible. I think it was quite good that the Liberal Democrats had to compromise a bit with the Tories. He also criticised the previous  |Labour|New_Labour|  government, commenting: Although my inclinations are slightly  |left-of-centre|Centre-Left_Politics| , I was terribly disappointed with the last Labour government.  |Gordon_Brown|Gordon_Brown|  lacked emotional intelligence and was never a leader. Cleese also declared his support for  |proportional_representation|Proportional_Representation| .      In April 2011, Cleese said that he had declined a  |life_peerage|Life_Peerage|  for political services in 1999. Outgoing leader of the Liberal Democrats  |Paddy_Ashdown|Paddy_Ashdown|  had put forward the suggestion shortly before stepping down, with the idea that Cleese would take the party whip and sit as a working peer, but the actor quipped that he realised this involved being in England in the winter and I thought that was too much of a price to pay. Cleese also declined a  |CBE_title|Order_Of_The_British_Empire|  in 1996 as he thought, they were silly.      In an interview with  The Daily Telegraph  in 2014, Cleese expressed political interest about the  |UK_Independence_Party|Uk_Independence_Party| , saying that although he was in doubt as to whether he was prepared to vote for it, he was attracted to its challenge to the established political order and the radicalism of its policies on the United Kingdoms membership of the  |European_Union|European_Union| . He expressed support for immigration, but also concern about the integration of immigrants into British culture.      Talking to  Der Spiegel  in 2015, Cleese expressed a critical view on what he saw as a  |plutocracy|Plutocracy|  that was unhealthily developing control of the governance of the  |First_Worlds|First_World|  societies, stating that he had reached a point when he saw that our existence here is absolutely hopeless.

In 2016, Cleese publicly supported  |Brexit|Brexit|  in the  |2016_referendum|2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_Membership_Referendum|  on leaving the European Union.  He tweeted: If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU, Id vote to stay in. But there isnt. Sad.

In July 2018, Cleese said that he was leaving the UK to relocate to the Caribbean island of  |Nevis|Nevis| , partly over frustration around the standard of the Brexit debate, including dreadful lies by  |the_right|Right-Wing_Politics|  and a lack of reform regarding the press and the voting system.  He emigrated to Nevis on 1 November 2018.      During then-Republican nominee  |Donald_Trumps|Donald_Trump|  run for the US Presidency in 2016, Cleese described Trump as a narcissist, with no attention span, who doesnt have clear ideas about anything and makes it all up as he goes along .  He had previously described the leadership of the Republican Party as the most cynical, most disgracefully immoral people Ive ever come across in a Western civilisation .     In May 2019, Cleese repeated his previous statement that London was no longer an English city, saying virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation. So there must be some truth in it... I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU.  |London_Mayor|London_Mayor| |Sadiq_Khan|Sadiq_Khan|  responded, These comments make John Cleese sound like hes in character as  |Basil_Fawlty|Basil_Fawlty| . Londoners know that our diversity is our greatest strength. We are proudly the English capital, a European city and a global hub. Cleese added, I suspect I should apologise for my affection for the Englishness of my upbringing, but in some ways I found it calmer, more polite, more humorous, less tabloid, and less money-oriented than the one that is replacing it.        In 1992, the UK Health Education Authority  recruited Cleese—an ex-smoker—to star in a series of anti-smoking  |public_service_announcements|Public_Service_Announcements|  on British television, which took the form of sketches rife with morbid humor about smoking and were designed to encourage adult smokers to quit.  In a controlled study of regions of central and northern England, one region received no intervention, the PSAs were broadcast in two regions, and one region received both the PSAs plus locally organised anti-tobacco campaigning. The study found that smokers in regions where the PSAs were broadcast were about half again as likely to have quit at the 18-month follow-up point as those who did not see them, irrespective of the local anti-tobacco campaign.       Cleese met  |Connie_Booth|Connie_Booth|  in the US and they married in 1968. In 1971, Booth gave birth to Cynthia Cleese, their only child.

The divorce settlement left Eichelberger with  |£|Pound_Sterling| 12  million in finance and assets, including £600,000 a year for seven years. Cleese said, What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine ... I got off lightly. Think what Id have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship – such as children, or a conversation.      Less than a year later, he returned to the UK, where he has property in London and a home on the  |Royal_Crescent|Royal_Crescent|  in  |Bath,_Somerset|Bath,_Somerset| .

The project had been partly funded by Cleeses donation of the proceeds from the London premier of Fierce Creatures.  Cleese is quoted as saying, I adore lemurs. Theyre extremely gentle, well-mannered, pretty and yet great fun  ... I should have married one.     The  |Bemaraha_woolly_lemur|Bemaraha_Woolly_Lemur|  , also known as Cleeses woolly lemur, is native to western Madagascar. The scientist who discovered the species named it after Cleese, mainly because of Cleeses fondness for lemurs and his efforts at protecting and preserving them.
