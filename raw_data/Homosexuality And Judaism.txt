      The subject of  homosexuality and Judaism  dates back to the  |Torah|Torah| . The book of Vayikra  is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males as a  toeivah  that can be subject to capital punishment by the currently non-existent  |Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin|  under  halakha  .             The issue has been a subject of contention within modern  |Jewish_denominations|Jewish_Denominations| , and has led to debate and division. Traditionally, Judaism has understood  |homosexual|Homosexuality|  male intercourse as contrary to Judaism, and this opinion is still maintained by  |Orthodox_Judaism|Orthodox_Judaism| . On the other hand,  |Reconstructionist_Judaism|Reconstructionist_Judaism|  and  |Reform_Judaism|Reform_Judaism|  do not hold this view, and allow homosexual intercourse and  |same-sex_marriage|Same-Sex_Marriage| .  |Conservative_Judaisms|Conservative_Judaism| |Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards|Committee_On_Jewish_Law_And_Standards| , which until December 2006 held the same position as Orthodoxy, recently issued multiple opinions under its philosophy of  |pluralism|Pluralism| , with one opinion continuing to follow the Orthodox position and another opinion substantially liberalizing its view of homosexual sex and relationships, while continuing to regard certain sexual acts as prohibited.     Allen Bennett became the first openly gay rabbi in the United States in 1978.   |Lionel_Blue|Lionel_Blue|  was the first British rabbi to publicly declare himself as gay, which he did in 1980.             The  |Book_of_Leviticus|Book_Of_Leviticus|  refers to  |male_homosexual_sexual_practices|Gay_Sexual_Practices|  twice  |kedeshah|Qedesha| , nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a  |Kadesh|Qedesha| . This has been interpreted as prohibiting the sons of Israel from serving as a homosexual  |temple_prostitute|Temple_Prostitute| .      The story of  |Ruth_and_Naomi|Ruth_And_Naomi|  in the Book of Ruth is also occasionally interpreted as the story of a lesbian couple,   , by  |Rebecca_Alpert|Rebecca_Alpert| , in Reading Ruth: Contemporary Women Reclaim a Sacred Story, edited by J. A. Kates and G.T. Reimer . while the biblical description of the relationship between  |David_and_Jonathan|David_And_Jonathan|  in the Book of Kings is sometimes interpreted as male homosexual love.              Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation was the  |death_penalty|Death_Penalty| , though minors under 13 years of age were exempt from this, as from any other penalty . However, even in Biblical times, it was very difficult to get a conviction that would lead to this prescribed punishment. The Jewish  |Oral_Law|Oral_Torah|  states that capital punishment would be applicable only if two men were caught in the act of anal sex, if there were two witnesses to the act, if the men involved were warned that they committed a capital offense, and the two men — or the willing party, in case of rape — subsequently acknowledged the warning, but continued to engage in the prohibited act anyway. In fact, there is no account of capital punishment, in regards to this law, in Jewish history.     Rabbinic tradition understands the Torahs system of capital punishment to not be in effect for the past approximately 2,000 years, in the absence of a  |Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin|  and  |Temple|The_Third_Temple| .      Classical rabbinic Jewish sources do not specifically mention that homosexual attraction is inherently sinful. However, someone who has had homosexual intercourse is considered to have violated a prohibition. If he does  |teshuva|Teshuva|  , i. e., he ceases his forbidden actions, regrets what he has done, apologizes to God, and makes a binding resolution never to repeat those actions, he is seen to be forgiven by God. Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance, Chapter 2       Why lesbianism is not explicitly prohibited in the Bible has become a matter of interpretation. Suggestions range from the idea that in ancient times, only acts in which men emitted semen were defined as sexual, to the assumption that in biblical times, sexual attraction between women did not exist, to the belief that religious rules that apply to men automatically apply to women. Encyclopaedia Judaica   second edition   vol 12   pg 661   Lesbianism   Rebecca Alpert     Sexual liaisons between women are, however, viewed as forbidden by Orthodox  |rabbis|Rabbinical_Literature| . This view is based on a  |Drash|Midrash|  interpretation of the Biblical verse, Do not follow the ways of Egypt, where you once lived, nor of Canaan, where I will be bringing you. Do not follow any of their customs. .     The Talmud prohibits any activity which it defines as mesolelot or tribadism . The main concern in the Talmud was whether women who carried out acts were eligible to marry a member of  |the_priesthood|Kohanim| . It was doubtful whether this activity removed their status as a virgin, or made them a harlot. Maimonides suggests that this behavior should not disqualify a woman from marrying a priest. Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to flagellation, rather than the death penalty. Encyclopaedia Judaica   vol 9   second edition   pg 518   Homosexuality       The  |Babylonian_Talmud|Babylonian_Talmud|  is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to  |same-sex_marriage|Same-Sex_Marriage| |Midrash_Rabba|Midrash_Rabba|  states: Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Joseph The generation of the flood was not obliterated from the world until they wrote marriage contracts from males and beasts. Genesis Rabba, 26:5       The Pesikta Zutrasa interprets the reason for the prohibition in Leviticus against homosexuality in terms of homosexuality being non-procreative.  |Nachmanides|Nachmanides|  and the author of the  Sefer Hachinuch  similarly follow this interpretation. Rabbi Joel Roth.  rabbinicalassembly.org 1992.     The  |Tosafot|Tosafot| , the  |Rosh|Asher_Ben_Jehiel|  and the  |Ran|Nissim_Of_Gerona|  understand the reason for the prohibition as that as a result of homosexuality, a man abandons his wife to pursue a homosexual relation.       While a variety of views regarding homosexuality as an inclination or status exist within the  |Orthodox_Jewish|Orthodox_Judaism|  community, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is some disagreement about which male homosexual acts come under core prohibitions, the majority of Orthodox Judaism puts male-male  |anal_sex|Anal_Sex|  in the category of yehareg veal yaavor, die rather than transgress , the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of  |Self-sacrifice_under_Jewish_Law|Self-Sacrifice_Under_Jewish_Law|  to die rather than do. Similarly, some consider lesbianism a martyrdom-demanding transgression if only based upon the principle of abizrayhu .  According to the Talmud, homosexual acts are forbidden between non-Jews as well, and this is included among the sexual restrictions of the  |Noachide_laws|Noachide_Laws| .  The archetypal model in Judaism is marital heterosexuality with celibacy, fornication, incest, bestiality and homosexuality seen to be part of a continuous prism of wrong.      In a speech given in 1986, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi  |Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson|Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson| , discussed individuals who express an inclination towards a particular form of physical relationship in which the libidinal gratification is sought with members of ones own gender . He wrote that society and government must be to offer a helping hand to those who are afflicted with this problem .      Rabbi Dr.  |Immanuel_Jakobovits|Immanuel_Jakobovits| , in his entry Homosexuality in the  Encyclopedia Judaica  , describes the traditional opinion on homosexuality in this way: Jewish law rejects the view that homosexuality is to be regarded merely as a disease or as morally neutral.... Jewish law holds that no hedonistic ethic, even if called love , can justify the morality of homosexuality any more than it can legitimize  |adultery|Adultery|  or  |incest|Incest| , however genuinely such acts may be performed out of love and by mutual consent. Rabbi  |Norman_Lamm|Norman_Lamm|   advocated  that some homosexuals should be viewed as diseased and in need of compassion and treatment, rather than willful rebels who should be ostracized. He distinguishes between six varieties of homosexuals, including genuine homosexuals who have strong preferential erotic feelings for members of the same sex , transitory and situational homosexuals who would prefer heterosexual intercourse but are denied it or seek gain in homosexuality, and heterosexuals who are merely curious.     When  |Steven_Greenberg|Steven_Greenberg| , who received Orthodox rabbinic ordination, publicly announced in 1999 that he was homosexual, there was a significant response from rabbis of all denominations reported in the Jewish newspapers. Rabbi  |Moshe_Tendler|Moshe_Tendler| , a leading rabbi at  |Yeshiva_University|Yeshiva_University| , stated, It is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society.  As Greenberg has a  |rabbinic_ordination|Semichah|  from the Orthodox rabbinical seminary of Yeshiva University , he is generally described as the first openly gay Orthodox Jewish rabbi.       However, some Orthodox Jews, including many rabbis, dispute his being an Orthodox rabbi.      Orthodox Israeli rabbi  |Ron_Yosef|Ron_Yosef|  became in 2009 the first Israeli Orthodox  |Rabbi|Rabbi|  to come out, by appearing in Uvda ,  |Israels|Israel|  leading investigative television program, in an episode regarding  |conversion_therapies|Conversion_Therapies|  in Israel.  Yosef remains in his position as a pulpit Rabbi.  Yosef testified that his Yemenite congregation did not accept him being a homosexual very easily and it took them a while to accept it. He stated that the younger generation strengthened and supported him, while the older generation had a more difficult experience. Yosef received death threats in the year leading up to the  |2009_Tel_Aviv_gay_centre_shooting|2009_Tel_Aviv_Gay_Centre_Shooting| .  In 2013, he stated he is in a relationship with a man. minute 00:39 in a radio interview with Razi Barkay here  |ganizati|Ganizati| Isur Mishkav Zacharas opposed to the homosexual  |orientation|Sexual_Orientation|  itselfprayer quorum |litici|Litici| i. e., rabbinic leadersseclusiontoeivassaovercoming and taming impulses for forbidden behaviorRCA |ganizati|Ganizati| |ganizati|Ganizati| |ganizati|Ganizati|  Majesty  Masorti CJLSbut not all  |die_rather_than_transgress|Self-Sacrifice_Under_Jewish_Law|  offense |b|B| now the  |American_Jewish_University|American_Jewish_University| mara datraequivalent to the CJLSCCARsanctification11 to 1, 1 abstentionrabbinical opinion2009RRAand OHALAH and the Rabbinic Pastors Association .
