           Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa  was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher and philosopher, described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the  |Portuguese_language|Portuguese_Language| . He also wrote in and translated from English and French.     Pessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created up approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them all pseudonyms because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them  |heteronyms|Heteronym| . These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.            Pessoa was born in  |Lisbon|Lisbon|  on 13 June 1888. When Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pessôa, died of  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis|  and the following year, on 2 January, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.     After the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, proxy wedding to João Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for South Africa in the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed Portuguese  |consul|Consul|  in  |Durban|Durban| , capital of the former British  |Colony_of_Natal|Colony_Of_Natal| . Later on, in 1918, Pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:               The young Pessoa received his early education at St. Joseph Convent School, a Catholic grammar school run by Irish and French nuns. He moved to the  |Durban_High_School|Durban_High_School|  in April 1899, becoming fluent in English and developing an appreciation for English literature. During the  |Matriculation_Examination|Matriculation_Examination| , held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope , in November 1903, he was awarded the recently created  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria|  Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the Durban Commercial High School during one year, taking night classes.          Meanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished. Zenith, Richard , Fotobiografias Século XX: Fernando Pessoa, Lisboa: Círculo de Leitores. At the age of sixteen,  The Natal Mercury   published his poem Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme... , under the name of C. R. Anon , along with a brief introductory text: I read with great amusement... . In December, The Durban High School Magazine published his essay Macaulay . Monteiro, Maria da Encarnação , Incidências Inglesas na Poesia de Fernando Pessoa, Coimbra: author ed. From February to June 1905, in the section The Man in the Moon , The Natal Mercury also published at least four sonnets by Fernando Pessoa: Joseph Chamberlain , To England I , To England II and Liberty . Jennings, H. D. , Os Dois Exilios, Porto: Centro de Estudos Pessoanos His poems often carried humorous versions of  |Anon|Anonymity|  as the authors name. Pessoa started using  |pen_names|Pen_Names|  quite young. The first one, still in his childhood, was Chevalier de Pas, supposedly a French noble. In addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other meaningful names.     In the preface to The Book of Disquiet, Pessoa wrote about himself:             The young Pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:        Ten years after his arrival, he sailed for  |Lisbon|Lisbon|  via the  |Suez_Canal|Suez_Canal|  on board the Herzog , leaving Durban for good at the age of seventeen. This journey inspired the poems Opiário  published in March 1915, in  Orpheu  nr.1  and Ode Marítima  published in June 1915, in Orpheu nr.2 . by his  |heteronym|Heteronym| |_Álvaro_de_Campos|Álvaro_De_Campos| .              While his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy. After a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a  |student_strike|Student_Strike|  against the dictatorship of Prime Minister  |João_Franco|João_Franco|  put an end to his formal studies. Pessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at R.G. Dun & Company, an American mercantile information agency . His grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the Empreza Ibis . The venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name  |ibis|Ibis| , Ibe name ibis has a very long literary tradition: the elegiac poem Ibis by  |Ovid|Ovid|  was inspired in the lost poem of the same title by  |Callimachus|Callimachus| . the sacred bird of  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt|  and inventor of the alphabet in  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , would remain an important symbolic reference for him.     Pessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King  |Charles_I|Carlos_I_Of_Portugal|  and Crown Prince  |Luís_Filipe|Luís_Filipe_Prince_Royal_Of_Portugal|  in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful  |republican_revolution|5_October_1910_Revolution|  in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to Portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century. . In 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal A Águia, which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super- |Camões|Camões| . In 1915 a group of artists and poets, including Fernando Pessoa,  |Mário_de_Sá_Carneiro|Mário_De_Sá_Carneiro|  and  |Almada_Negreiros|Almada_Negreiros| , created the literary magazine  Orpheu , . which introduced  |modernist|Modernist|  literature to Portugal. Only two issues were published , the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties. Lost for many years, this issue was finally recovered and published in 1984. . Among other writers and poets,  Orpheu  published Pessoa, orthonym, and the modernist  |heteronym|Heteronym| ,  |Álvaro_de_Campos|Álvaro_De_Campos| .          Along with the artist Ruy Vaz, Pessoa also founded the art journal Athena , . in which he published verses under the  |heteronyms|Heteronym|  Alberto Caeiro and Ricardo Reis. Along with his profession, as free-lance commercial translator, Fernando Pessoa undertook intense activity as a writer, literary critic and political analyst, contributing to the journals and newspapers A Águia , A República , Theatro , A Renascença , O Raio , A Galera , Orpheu , O Jornal , Eh Real! , Exílio , Centauro , A Ideia Nacional , Terra Nossa , O Heraldo , Portugal Futurista , Acção , Ressurreição , Contemporânea , Athena , Diário de Lisboa , Revista de Comércio e Contabilidade , Sol , O Imparcial , Presença , Revista Solução Editora , Notícias Ilustrado , Girassol , Revolução , Descobrimento , Fama , Fradique and Sudoeste .     flâneur     After his return to Portugal, when he was seventeen, Pessoa barely left his beloved city of Lisbon, which inspired the poems Lisbon Revisited , under the  |heteronym|Heteronym| |_Álvaro_de_Campos|Álvaro_De_Campos| . From 1905 to 1920, when his family returned from  |Pretoria|Pretoria|  after the death of his stepfather, he lived in fifteen different locations in the city, Zenith, Richard , Fotobiografias do Século XX: Fernando Pessoa. Lisboa: Círculo de Leitores, pp. 194–195. moving from one rented room to another depending on his fluctuating finances and personal troubles.     Pessoa adopted the detached perspective of the  |flâneur|Flâneur|  Bernardo Soares, another of his  |heteronyms|Heteronym| . Guerreiro, Ricardina , De Luto por Existir: a melancolia de Bernardo Soares à luz de Walter Benjamin. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim, p. 159. This character was supposedly an accountant, working for Vasques, the boss of an office located in Douradores Street. Soares also supposedly lived in the same downtown street, a world that Pessoa knew quite well due to his long career as freelance correspondence translator. Indeed, from 1907 until his death in 1935, Pessoa worked in twenty-one firms located in Lisbons downtown, sometimes in two or three of them simultaneously. Sousa, João Rui de , Fernando Pessoa Empregado de Escritório, 2nd ed. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim. In  The Book of Disquiet , Bernardo Soares describes some of those typical places and its atmosphere . In his daydream soliloquy he also wrote about Lisbon in the first half of the 20th century. Soares describes crowds in the streets, buildings, shops, traffic, river Tagus, the weather, and even its author, Fernando Pessoa:               A statue of Pessoa sitting at a table can be seen outside  |A_Brasileira|A_Brasileira| , one of the preferred places of young writers and artists of Geração de Orpheu Orpheus group during the 1910s. This coffeehouse, in the aristocratic district of Chiado , is quite close to Pessoas birthplace: 4, São Carlos Square , Lisbons Opera House. one of the most elegant neighborhoods of Lisbon. . Later on, Pessoa was a frequent customer at Martinho da Arcada, a centennial coffeehouse in Comercio Square, surrounded by ministries, almost an office for his private business and literary concerns, where he used to meet friends in the 1920s and 1930s.     In 1925, Pessoa wrote in English a guidebook to Lisbon but it remained unpublished until 1992. .

Poetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.     Caeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving . Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the readers attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.     As such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply—is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply—are.     Caeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed, Caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself. Pessoa, Fernando, Notas Para Recordação do Meu Mestre Caeiro in Presença nr. 30, Jan.-Feb. 1930, Coimbra.     The critic Jane M. Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro—who was Pessoas first major heteronym—as essential in founding the later poetic personasin Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, Vol. XLVI, Nr. 1, January 1969, pp. 39–47.         thu .     In a letter to William Bentley, This letter, to the director of the journal Portugal, was written on 31 October 1924, to announce Pessoas art journal Athena. Pessoa wrote that a knowledge of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the Odes of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of António Vieira , as his stile and diction that of Horace . Pessoa, Fernando , Correspondência 1923–1935, ed. Manuela Parreira da Silva. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim, p.53, .     Reis, both a character and a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa himself, sums up his philosophy of life in his own words, admonishing, See life from a distance. Never question it. Theres nothing it can tell you. Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility. Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself. In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.     Believing in the Greek gods , yet living in a Christian Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his epicureanist philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.     Where Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes .     In his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoas constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonyms wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiros spirit and style. As such, where Caeiros predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural , Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.     Ricardo Reis is the main character of José Saramago s 1986 novel  |The_Year_of_the_Death_of_Ricardo_Reis|The_Year_Of_The_Death_Of_Ricardo_Reis|  Portugal Futurista, the art journal that published Campos Ultimatum in 1917.     Álvaro de Campos manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being to feel everything in every way. The best way to travel, he wrote, is to feel. As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god , on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.     As a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.     One of the poets constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation Tobacco Shop he asks:                 thu     Mensagem, written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles: Message, Tr. by Jonathan Griffin , Exeter: Shearsman Books, 2007.     The first, called Brasão , relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the Portuguese coat of arms . The first two poems draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the Golden Age of Discovery .     The second Part, called Mar Português , references the countrys Age of Portuguese Exploration and to its seaborne Empire that ended with the death of King Sebastian at El-Ksar el Kebir in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.     The third Cycle, called O Encoberto , refers to Pessoas vision of a future world of peace and the Fifth Empire . After the Age of Force, , and Taedium will come Science through a reawakening of The Hidden One , or King Sebastian . The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.     King Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that its possible to achieve dreams.     One of the most famous quotes from Mensagem is the first line from O Infante , which is Deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce . Another well-known quote from Mensagem is the first line from Ulysses, O mito é o nada que é tudo . This poem refers to Ulysses , king of Ithaca , as Lisbons founder .   1st. edition, 1934, at the Portuguese National Library.         thu     In 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays for the cultural journal A Águia , founded in Oporto , in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascença Portuguesa. Martins, Fernando Cabral . Dicionário de Fernando Pessoa e do Modernismo Português. Alfragide: Editorial Caminho. In the first years of the Portuguese Republic , this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet Teixeira de Pascoaes , philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortesão, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called Saudosismo. The Portuguese Republic was founded by the revolution of 5 October 1910, giving freedom of association and publishing. Pessoa contributed to the journal A Águia with a series of papers: The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered , Relapsing... and The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry . These writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of Teixeira de Pascoaes and Mário Beirão . The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends. On the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet – a super- Camões – pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity. Pessoa, Fernando . Textos de Crítica e de Intervenção. Lisboa: Edições Ática.       The philosophical notes of the young Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of Philosophy more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern. The issues he engages with pertain to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length varies between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.     Pessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:     thu .     Relative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege Spirit or Matter as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.   Absolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience .   The materialistic Pantheism of Spinoza and the spiritualizing Pantheism of Malebranche , admit that experience is a double manifestation of any thing that in its essence has no matter neither spirit .   Considering both elements as an illusory manifestation , of a transcendent and true and alone realities, there is Transcendentalism , inclined into matter with Schopenhauer , or into spirit, a position where Bergson could be emplaced.   A terminal system the limited and summit of metaphysics would not radicalize – as poles of experience – one of the single categories: matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as the essence of the universe and defends that an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves . The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There is one only and eternal example of it. It is that cathedral of thought -the philosophy of Hegel .   Such pantheist transcendentalism is used by Pessoa to define the project that encompasses and exceeds all systems ; to characterize the new poetry of Saudosismo where the typical contradiction of this system occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive to find in everything a beyond .
