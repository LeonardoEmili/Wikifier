Naiad , also known as Neptune  III, is the  |innermost_satellite|Inner_Satellite|  of  |Neptune|Neptune| , named after the  |Naiads|Naiads|  of  |Greek_legend|Greek_Mythology| .       Naiad was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989 from the images taken by the  Voyager 2   |probe|Space_Probe| . The last moon to be discovered during the flyby, it was designated S/1989  N  6. The discovery was announced on 29 September 1989, in the IAU Circular No. 4867, and mentions 25 frames taken over 11 days , implying a discovery date of sometime before September 18. The name was given on 16 September 1991.          Naiad is irregularly shaped. It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptunes original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from  |Triton|Triton|  soon after that moons capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.       Naiad is in a 73:69  |orbital_resonance|Orbital_Resonance|  with the next outward moon,  |Thalassa|Thalassa| , in a dance of avoidance . As it orbits Neptune, the more inclined Naiad successively passes Thalassa twice from above and then twice from below, in a cycle that repeats every ~21.5 Earth days. The two moons are about 3540 km apart when they pass each other. Although their orbital radii differ by only 1850 km, Naiad swings ~2800 km above or below Thalassas orbital plane at closest approach. Thus this resonance, like many such orbital correlations, serves to stabilize the orbits by maximizing separation at conjunction. However, the role of orbital inclination in maintaining this avoidance in a case where eccentricities are minimal is unusual.       Since the Voyager 2 flyby, the Neptune system has been extensively studied from ground-based  |observatories|Observatory|  and the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope|  as well. In 2002â€“03 the  |Keck_telescope|Keck_Telescopes|  observed the system using  |adaptive_optics|Adaptive_Optics|  and detected easily the largest four inner satellites.  |Thalassa|Thalassa|  was found with some image processing, but Naiad was not located. Hubble has the ability to detect all the known satellites and possible new satellites even dimmer than those found by Voyager 2. On October 8, 2013 the SETI Institute announced that Naiad had been located in archived Hubble imagery from 2004.  The suspicion that the loss of positioning was due to considerable errors in Naiads  |ephemeris|Ephemeris|.
