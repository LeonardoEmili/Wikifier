     Continuum mechanics is a branch of  |mechanics|Mechanics|  that deals with the mechanical behavior of materials modeled as a continuous mass rather than as discrete particles. The French mathematician  |Augustin-Louis_Cauchy|Augustin-Louis_Cauchy|  was the first to formulate such models in the 19th century.          Modeling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies. Modeling objects in this way ignores the fact that matter is made of  |atoms|Atom| , and so is not continuous; however, on  |length_scales|Length_Scale|  much greater than that of inter-atomic distances, such models are highly accurate. Fundamental physical laws such as the  |conservation_of_mass|Conservation_Of_Mass| , the  |conservation_of_momentum|Conservation_Of_Momentum| , and the  |conservation_of_energy|Conservation_Of_Energy|  may be applied to such models to derive  |differential_equations|Differential_Equations|  describing the behavior of such objects, and some information about the particular material studied is added through  |constitutive_relations|Constitutive_Relation| .     Continuum mechanics deals with physical properties of solids and fluids which are independent of any particular  |coordinate_system|Coordinate_System|  in which they are observed. These physical properties are then represented by  |tensors|Tensor| , which are mathematical objects that have the required property of being independent of coordinate system. These tensors can be expressed in coordinate systems for computational convenience.       Materials, such as solids, liquids and gases, are composed of  |molecules|Molecule|  separated by space. On a microscopic scale, materials have cracks and discontinuities. However, certain physical phenomena can be modeled assuming the materials exist as a continuum, meaning the matter in the body is continuously distributed and fills the entire region of space it occupies. A continuum is a body that can be continually sub-divided into  |infinitesimal|Infinitesimal|  elements with properties being those of the bulk material.     The validity of the continuum assumption may be verified by a theoretical analysis, in which either some clear periodicity is identified or  |statistical_homogeneity|Homogeneity|  and  |ergodicity|Ergodicity|  of the  |microstructure|Microstructure|  exists. More specifically, the continuum hypothesis/assumption hinges on the concepts of a  |representative_elementary_volume|Representative_Elementary_Volume|  and separation of scales based on the  |Hill–Mandel_condition|Hill–Mandel_Condition| . This condition provides a link between an experimentalists and a theoreticians viewpoint on constitutive equations as well as a way of spatial and statistical averaging of the microstructure.      When the separation of scales does not hold, or when one wants to establish a continuum of a finer resolution than that of the representative volume element size, one employs a statistical volume element , which, in turn, leads to random continuum fields. The latter then provide a micromechanics basis for stochastic finite elements . The levels of SVE and RVE link continuum mechanics to  |statistical_mechanics|Statistical_Mechanics| . The RVE may be assessed only in a limited way via experimental testing: when the constitutive response becomes spatially homogeneous.     Specifically for  |fluids|Fluid| , the  |Knudsen_number|Knudsen_Number|  is used to assess to what extent the approximation of continuity can be made.       Consider car traffic on a highway, with just one lane for simplicity.   Somewhat surprisingly, and in a tribute to its effectiveness, continuum mechanics effectively models the movement of cars via a  |partial_differential_equation|Partial_Differential_Equation|  for the density of cars.   The familiarity of this situation empowers us to understand a little of the continuum-discrete dichotomy underlying continuum modelling in general.     To start modelling define that: x measures distance along the highway; t is time ;   is the density of cars on the highway ; and u is the  |flow_velocity|Flow_Velocity|  of those cars at position x .      |Partial_differential_equation|Partial_Differential_Equation| arrayrcldNdtddtabx,tab  tb,tdbdta,tdadtab  tb,tb,ta,ta,tab  t  x  uarray  t  x  u except at low density  for density in cars/km  t  x   Bi1See figure 1 |themati|Themati| x  X  |themati|Themati|  forces parallel to the material surface on which they act |Euler-Cauchys_stress_principle|Cauchy_Stress_Tensor| for continuous bodies these laws are called the  |Eulers_equations_of_motion|Eulers_Laws| |chani|Chani|   n,   x, tsee  |Euler-Cauchys_stress_principle|Cauchy_Stress_Tensor| |surface_integral|Surface_Integral| |ionic|Ionic_Bond| ,  |metallic|Metallic_Bond| , and  |van_der_Waals_forces|Van_Der_Waals_Force|  or massinternal forces |gravitational_forces|Gravitational_Force| |electromagnetic_forces|Electromagnetic_Force|    x, tper unit of mass  x, t bi  pi   |electric_charge|Electric_Charge| |torques|Torque|  surface couples, contact torques e.g. boneswith respect to the origin of the coordinate system |chani|Chani| |chani|Chani|   B  BFigure 2  B |chani|Chani|   B  2  X, t  B  Bx  B  Bij  X,tij ij  X,t  tij  X,t  xd  xdt    t  v  xd2  xdt2    t2  B  B-1  x, t  B  B    XJ  xi  XJij    X,tij  x,tij  x,tij     x,tddtij  x,t  tij  x,t  xkij  x,tdxkdtij  x,tmotion |ct|Ct|   X,t  x,t  X,t  X,toriJiJ  x,t  x,torJiJiJiiJiJorJiiJ  X,t  EJ  x,tJiiJ  X,t  X,toriJ  x,t  x,torJimass, momentum, energyan open subset of Euclidean spacethe boundary of   x      the direction   ddt         assuming the source term is zero for the mass and angular momentum equations         +       & 0   & &         -       -   & 0   & &         &     & &         -   +       -   & 0   & &          b  Lagrangian point of view         -   & 0 & &           -   -  & 0 & &             &   & &             -   +   -   & 0   & &         PP          -   & 0 & &           -   -  & 0 & &             &   & &             -   +   -   & 0   & &           1  vi  xjeei,jee  vi  xii,i  S  xjeij,jevSe  1  vi  XjEEi,jEE  vi  Xii,i  S  XjEij,jEvSEABi,j1ijijtrace i.e. entropy per unit massas a flux or from internal sourcesvnqddt      -                 ~  -       +             -         +         -       -             .
