A mercy rule, slaughter rule, knockout rule, or skunk rule ends a two-competitor  |sports_competition|Sports_Competition|  earlier than the scheduled endpoint if one competitor has a very large and presumably insurmountable  |scoring|Score|  lead over the other. It is called the mercy rule because it spares further humiliation for the loser. It is common in  |youth_sports|Youth_Sports|  in  |North_America|North_America| , where  |running_up_the_score|Running_Up_The_Score|  is considered unsporting. It is especially common in  |baseball|Baseball|  and  |softball|Softball|  in which there is no  |game_clock|Game_Clock|  and a dominant team could in theory continue an  |inning|Inning|  endlessly.     The rules vary widely, depending on the level of competition, but nearly all  |youth_sports|Youth_Sports|  leagues and  |high_school_sports|High_School_Sports|  associations and many  |college_sports|College_Sports|  associations in the United States have mercy rules for sports including baseball, softball, American football and association football.     However, mercy rules usually do not take effect until a prescribed point in the game . Thus, one team, particularly if it is decidedly better than a weaker opponent, can still run up the score before the rule takes effect. For instance, in  |American_football|American_Football| , one team could be ahead by 70 points with three minutes left in the first half; in baseball, the better team could have a 20-run lead in the second inning, but the game would still continue.           At the middle- or high-school level, 34 states use a mercy rule that may involve a continuous clock once a team has a certain lead during the second half. That greatly decreases the amount of time taken for a game to complete, which reduces the leading teams chances to score more and the time that the trailing team must spend in facing an insurmountable deficit. In most states, the clock stops only for scores, timeouts , or the end of the quarter. Plays that would normally stop the clock, such as penalties, incomplete passes, going out of bounds, or change of possession, would not stop the clock. The rule varies by state; for example, the clock does not stop upon a score in Colorado,  |Kansas|Kansas_State_High_School_Activities_Association|  , or  |Missouri|Missouri_State_High_School_Activities_Association|  .     In most states, once the point differential is reduced to below the mercy rule-invoking amount, normal timing procedures resume until either the end of the game or the mercy rule-invoking point differential is re-established; in Colorado, Georgia, and Kansas, the clock continues to run even if the differential falls below the threshold. Most states that have mercy rules waive this rule for a championship game.     In some states, coaches and game officials may choose to end a game at their own discretion at any time during the second half if the continuous clock rule is in effect; that usually happens if a lopsided margin continues to increase or if threatening weather is imminent. Sometimes the coach of the team that is losing agrees to shorten the length of a quarter in addition to the continuous clock rule. Although it is rare, some states or high school conferences have rules in which the team with a very large lead may not run a certain play for the rest of the game, such as a deep pass or outside run.     In some states , the rules call for a game to end when one team is ahead by a certain score at halftime or any time thereafter.  In other states with 6- or 8-man football, continuous clock rules are used, and the rule may be modified; for instance, in Iowa, the rule goes into effect if the 35-point differential is reached at any time after the first quarter.     In a variant on the mercy rule used in  |Connecticut_high_school_football|Connecticut_Interscholastic_Athletic_Conference|  from 2006 to 2016, the teams coach was issued a one-game suspension if at any point the team had a 50-point lead.  In 2016 it was replaced with a running clock rule.       The  |National_Collegiate_Athletic_Associations|National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|  mercy rule provides, Any time during the game, the playing time of any remaining period or periods and the intermission between halves may be shortened by mutual agreement of the opposing head coaches and the referee.  NCAA Football Approved Ruling 3-2-2-I cites an example: At halftime the score is 56–0. The coaches and the referee agree that the third and fourth quarters should be shortened to 12 minutes each. The coaches also request that the second half be played with a running clock i.e., that the game clock not be stopped. The NCAA Football Rules Committee determined, The remaining quarters may be shortened to 12 minutes each. However, the running clock is not allowed; normal clock rules apply for the entire game.      The most recent example of an NCAA football game shortened by invoking this rule occurred September 1, 2018 during a game Georgia played against Austin Peay in Athens Georgia.  With the score 45-0 in the 3rd quarter and a high heat index, the Austin Peay Coach  |Will_Healy|Will_Healy|  suggested to Georgia head coach Kirby Smart that they play a 10 minute fourth quarter instead of the typical 15 minute fourth quarter.  The coaches and referee agreed and the game was shortened.      September 24, 2016 the  |Missouri_Tigers|2016_Missouri_Tigers_Football_Team|  led  |Delaware_State|2016_Delaware_State_Hornets_Football_Team|  58–0 at halftime. The coaches agreed to shorten the third and fourth quarters from 15 minutes to 10 minutes each, shortening the total game time from 60 minutes to 50 minutes. Missouri added three touchdowns in the abbreviated second half to make the final score 79–0, setting team records for the most points scored in a game , the greatest margin of victory , and the largest number of touchdowns scored . .     Also in 2016, the game between  |Clemson|2016_Clemson_Tigers_Football_Team|  and  |South_Carolina_State|2016_South_Carolina_State_Bulldogs_Football_Team|  had both the third and fourth quarters shortened from 15 minutes to 12 as a result of Clemson leading the game at half 45-0. The final score of the game was 59-0.      Earlier in 2016, the game between  |Texas_State|2016_Texas_State_Bobcats_Football_Team|  and  |Arkansas|2016_Arkansas_Razorbacks_Football_Team|  saw the fourth quarter shortened to 10 minutes when severe thunderstorms were approaching  |Donald_W._Reynolds_Razorback_Stadium|Donald_W._Reynolds_Razorback_Stadium| . Arkansas led 42–3 at the end of the third quarter, and the final period was scoreless. A similar scenario took place in 2017 in the game between  |TCU|2017_Tcu_Horned_Frogs_Football_Team|  and  |Kansas|2017_Kansas_Jayhawks_Football_Team| , where the coaches agreed to a running clock for the final 12:49 of the game due to severe thunderstorms approaching  |Amon_G._Carter_Stadium|Amon_G._Carter_Stadium| .     In a 2013 game,  |Old_Dominion_University|2013_Old_Dominion_Monarchs_Football_Team|  was losing to the  |University_of_North_Carolina|2013_North_Carolina_Tar_Heels_Football_Team|  80–20 when ODU coach  |Bobby_Wilder|Bobby_Wilder|  asked for the fourth quarter to be shortened by five minutes, which UNC coach  |Larry_Fedora|Larry_Fedora|  agreed to. Fedora also directed his quarterback to take a knee on fourth and goal with 1:53 remaining to not run up the score.      In a 1988 game,  |Kansas_Jayhawks|Kansas_Jayhawks_Football|  coach  |Glen_Mason|Glen_Mason|  asked if a running clock could be used after his team trailed 49–0 at halftime to the  |Auburn_Tigers|Auburn_Tigers_Football| . Auburn coach  |Pat_Dye|Pat_Dye|  and the officials agreed, and Auburn ended up a 56–7 winner.      Despite the NCAA Football Rules Committees subsequent ruling that a running clock is not permitted, a continuous clock was used September 5, 2013, beginning in the fourth quarter when the  |Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets|2013_Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_Football_Team|  had a 63–0 lead against the  |Elon_Phoenix|2013_Elon_Phoenix_Football_Team| . That was at the request of Elon coach  |Jason_Swepson|Jason_Swepson|  and agreed upon by Georgia Tech coach  |Paul_Johnson|Paul_Johnson| . Georgia Tech won the game 70–0.      However, in the Mississippi Association of Community and Junior Colleges, a running clock is allowed if the team is ahead by 38 points or more. This rule, unique only to the MACJC, was instituted in 2013.        |International_Blind_Sports_Federation|International_Blind_Sports_Federation|  rules require that any time during a game in which one team has scored ten more goals than the other team that game is deemed completed.   Section 17.7 In US high school soccer, most states use a mercy rule that ends the game if one team is ahead by 10 or more goals at any point from halftime onward. Youth soccer leagues use variations on the rule.       International competitions are sanctioned by the  |World_Baseball_Softball_Confederation|World_Baseball_Softball_Confederation|  , formed by the 2013 merger of the  |International_Baseball_Federation|International_Baseball_Federation|  and  |International_Softball_Federation|International_Softball_Federation|  .     In international baseball competition and the  |World_Baseball_Classic|World_Baseball_Classic|  , games are ended when one team is ahead by 10 runs, once at least seven completed innings are played by the trailing team. In seven inning contests , the same applies after five innings of a seven-inning game.  |International_Baseball_Federation|International_Baseball_Federation|  . . Rule C7.8, Run difference Rule . Accessed on 2008-03-13.     The  |inaugural_WBC|2006_World_Baseball_Classic|  in 2006 followed the IBAF mercy rule, with an additional rule stopping a game after five innings when a team is ahead by at least 15 runs. World Baseball Classic, Inc. . Accessed on 2008-03-13. The mercy rules applied to the round-robin matches only, not to the semi-finals or final.     In a six-inning game such as  |Little_League_Baseball_and_Softball|Little_League_Baseball| , rules call for the game to end if the winning team is ahead by 15 runs after three innings played or 10 runs after four innings played by the trailing team.     Softball rules are different for fast/modified fast pitch and slow pitch. In WBSC-sanctioned competitions, the run ahead rule is, for fast or modified fast pitch, 20 runs after three innings, 15 after four, or 8 after 5. In slow pitch, the margin is 20 runs after four innings or 15 after five.  The NCAA has also adopted the rule.     In regular season or conference tournament  |NCAA|National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|  and  |NAIA|National_Association_Of_Intercollegiate_Athletics|  college baseball, the IBAF rule may be implemented. Most NCAA conferences limit the rule to the final day of a series, for travel reasons, or primarily during conference tournaments where four to five games are played in a day, in order to allow the next game to start. The rule is not allowed in NCAA tournament play , in which all games must be at least nine innings.     In NCAA softball, the rule is invoked if one team is ahead by at least eight runs after five innings and, unlike with college baseball, applies in the NCAA tournament as well with the exception of the championship series. In American high school softball, most states use a mercy rule of 20 runs ahead in three innings or 10 in five innings.     Most state high school associations use the IBAF Womens rule after five innings have been played by the trailing team; some associations further the rule by ending a game after either three or four innings if the lead is at least 15 runs. For softball, the rule is 12 after three innings and 10 after five. However, since the home team has the last at-bat, the rules usually allow visiting teams to score an unlimited number of runs in the top half of an inning. That can be prevented by invoking the rule only after the home team has completed its half of the inning.     Due to the untimed nature of innings, some leagues either impose caps on the number of runs that can be scored in one inning or limit the number of plate appearances in an inning . Such rules ensure that games will complete in a reasonable length of time, but it can also mean that a lead of a certain size becomes insurmountable by the cap, which can be prevented by not invoking the rule in such circumstances.       In high school basketball, many states have a continuous clock rule, similar to American football, which takes effect in the second half after a lead grows to a prescribed point . The clock stops only for charged, officials or injury time-outs; or at the end of the third quarter. The clock would not stop when would normally stop, such as for fouls, free throws, out-of-bounds plays or substitutions.     The rules vary when normal timing procedures take effect after a lead is diminished ; for instance, in Iowa, normal timing procedures are enforced if the lead is lowered to 25 points but re-instituted once the lead grows back to 35 or more points. By comparison, in Kansas, if the running clock is triggered, it will not stop except for a timeout or an injury even if the differential is reduced to under 30 points. As with other sports, some states offer provisions to allow a team to end the game early by mutual decision of the coaches .       In amateur boxing, if a boxer trails by more than 20 points, the referee stops the fight and the boxer that is leading automatically wins; bouts which end this way may be noted as RSC with notations for an outclassed opponent , outscored opponent , injury or head injury .     While a boxer who loses on the mercy rule is scored RSCO and would be similar to a technical  |knockout|Knockout|  in  |professional_boxing|Professional_Boxing| , it is not scored a loss by knockout, and the 28-day suspension for losing on a knockout does not apply.       In curling the loser team can concede at any time, except for international competitions, where they need to wait until the completion of the 6th end to do so . , page 17 and 34     In special Curling, games end if 6 ends have passed and one team leads by 10 points.
