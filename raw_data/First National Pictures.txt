     First National Pictures was an American motion picture production and distribution company. It was founded in 1917 as First National Exhibitors Circuit, Inc., an association of independent theater owners in the United States, and became the countrys largest theater chain. Expanding from exhibiting movies to distributing them, the company reincorporated in 1919 as Associated First National Theatres, Inc., and Associated First National Pictures, Inc. In 1924 it expanded to become a motion picture production company as First National Pictures, Inc., and became an important studio in the film industry. In September 1928, control of First National passed to  |Warner_Bros.|Warner_Bros.| , into which it was completely absorbed on November 4, 1929. A number of Warner Bros. films were thereafter branded First National Pictures until July 1936, when First National Pictures, Inc., was dissolved.                  The First National Exhibitors Circuit was founded in 1917 by the merger of 26 of the biggest  |first-run|First_Run|  cinema chains in the United States. It eventually controlled over 600 cinemas, more than 200 of them first-run houses .     First National was the brainchild of  |Thomas_L._Tally|Thomas_L._Tally| , who was reacting to the overwhelming influence of  |Paramount_Pictures|Paramount_Pictures| , which dominated the market. In 1912, he thought that a conglomerate of theaters throughout the nation could buy or produce and distribute its own films. In 1917 Tally and  |J._D._Williams|James_Dixon_Williams|  formed First National Exhibitors Circuit.     The first film released through First National was the 1916 British film,  The Mother of Dartmoor . Between 1917 and 1918, the company made contracts with  |Mary_Pickford|Mary_Pickford|  and  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin| , the first million-dollar deals in the history of film. Chaplins contract allowed him to produce his films without a set release schedule. However, the production of the feature film  The Kid  ran so long that the company started to complain. To address their concerns, Chaplin invited the exhibitors to the studio, and they were so impressed by the project and charmed by the players, especially co-star  |Jackie_Coogan|Jackie_Coogan| , that they agreed to be patient. That patience was ultimately rewarded when The Kid became a major critical and box office success.  First Nationals distribution of films by independent producers is credited with launching careers including that of  |Louis_B._Mayer|Louis_B._Mayer| .       |Adolph_Zukor|Adolph_Zukor|  of  |Paramount_Pictures|Paramount_Pictures|  was threatened by First Nationals financial power and its control over the lucrative first-run theaters, and decided to enter the cinema business as well. With a $10 million investment, Paramount built its own chain of first-run movie theaters after a secret plan to merge with First National failed.     First National Exhibitors Circuit was reincorporated in 1919 as Associated First National Pictures, Inc., and its subsidiary, Associated First National Theatres, Inc., with 5,000 independent theater owners as members.
