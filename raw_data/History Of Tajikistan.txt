In 1929 Tajikistan was made one of the component republics of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  –  |Tajik_Soviet_Socialist_Republic|Tajik_Soviet_Socialist_Republic|  – and it kept that status until gaining independence 1991 after the  |dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union|Dissolution_Of_The_Soviet_Union| .     It has since experienced three changes in government and the  |Tajik_civil_war|Tajik_Civil_War| . A peace agreement among rival factions was signed in 1997.             Tajikistan was part of  |Scythia|Scythia|  in Classical Antiquity.  |Sogdiana|Sogdiana| ,  |Bactria|Bactria| ,  |Merv|Merv|  and  |Khorezm|Khorezm|  were the four principal divisions of Ancient Central Asia inhabited by the ancestors of the present-day Tajikistani Tajiks. Tajiks are now found only in historic Bactria and Sogdiana. Merv is inhabited by the  |Turkoman|Turkmen_People|  and Khorezm by  |Uzbeks|Uzbeks|  and  |Kazakhs|Kazakhs| . Sogdiana was made up of the  |Zeravshan|Zeravshan|  and  |Kashka-Darya|Kashka-Darya|  river valleys. Currently, two of the surviving peoples of Sogdiana who speak a dialect of the Sogdian language are the  |Yaghnobis|Yaghnobi_People|  and  |Shugnan|Shighnan| is.

Bactria was located in northern  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|   between the mountain range of the  |Hindu_Kush|Hindu_Kush|  and the  |Amu_Darya|Amu_Darya|   River and some areas of current south Tajikistan. During different periods, Bactria was a center of various Kingdoms or Empires, and is probably where  |Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrianism|  originated. The  |Avesta|Avesta|  —the holy book of Zoroastrianism—was written in the old-Bactrian dialect; it is also thought that Zoroaster was most likely born in Bactria.     Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of  |Kambojas|Kambojas| , which were referenced in the  |Mahabharata|Mahabharata|  epic as the  |Parama_Kamboja|Parama_Kamboja| , before it became part of the  |Achaemenid_Empire|Achaemenid_Empire| .

During the  |Achaemenid_period|Achaemenids| , Sogdiana and Bactria were part of the  |Persian_empire|Persian_Empire| . Sogdians and Bactrians occupied important positions in the administration and military of the Achaemenid Empire             After the Persian Empire was defeated by  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| , Bactria, Sogdiana and Merv, being part of Persian Empire, had to defend themselves from new invaders. In fact, the Macedonians faced very stiff resistance under the leadership of Sogdian ruler  |Spitamenes|Spitamenes| .  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  managed to marry  |Roxana|Roxana| , the daughter of a local ruler, and inherited his land. Following Alexanders brief occupation, the  |Hellenistic|Hellenistic|  successor states of the Seleucids and  |Greco-Bactrians|Greco-Bactrians|  controlled the area for another 200 years in what is known as the  |Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom| . During the time period from 90 BC to 30 BC,  |Yuezhi|Yuezhi|  destroyed the last Hellenistic  |successor_states|Successor_States|  and, together with the Tokhari, created a  |Kushan|Kushan|  Empire around 30 AD.          For another 400 years, until 410 AD, the Kushan Empire was a major power in the region along with the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , the  |Parthia|Parthia| n Empire and the  |Han|Han_Dynasty|  Empire . Notable contact was made with local peoples when the envoys of the  |Han_Dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  journeyed to this area in the 2nd century BC. At the end of the Kushan period, the Empire became much smaller and would have to defend itself from the powerful  |Sassanid|Sassanid_Dynasty|  Empire that replaced the Parthian Empire. The famous Kushan king Kanishka promoted Buddhism and during this time Buddhism was exported from Central Asia to China.            The Sassanids once controlled much of what is now Tajikistan, but lost the territory to the Hephthalites  during the time of  |Peroz_I|Peroz_I| .     They created a powerful empire that succeeded in making  |Iran|Iran|  a tributary state around 483–485. Shah of  |Persia|Persia| |Peroz|Peroz|  fought three wars with Hephthalites. During the first war he was captured by Hephthalite army and later was released after  |Byzantine|Byzantine|  emperor paid a ransom for him. During the second war Peroz was captured again and was released after paying a huge contribution to the Hephthalite king. During the third war Peroz was killed. The Hephthalites were subjugated in 565 by a combination of  |Sassanid|Sassanid|  and  |Kök-Turk|Göktürks|  forces. Subsequently, present Tajikistan was ruled by  |Göktürks|Göktürks|  and  |Sassanids|Sassanids| , however when the  |Sassanid_Empire|Sassanid_Empire|  fell the Turks kept control of Tajikistan but they later lost it to the  |Chinese_people|China| , however, they later managed to take control of Tajikistan once again, only to lose it to the Arabs in 710.              The Transoxiana principalities never formed a viable confederacy. Beginning in 651, the Arabs organized periodic marauding raids deep into the territory of Transoxania, but it was not until the appointment of Ibn Qutaiba as Governor of  |Khorasan|Greater_Khorasan|  in 705, during the reign of Walid I, that the Caliphate adopted the policy of annexing the lands beyond the Oxus. In 715, the task of annexation was accomplished. The entire region thus came under the control of the  |Caliph|Caliph|  and of Islam, but the Arabs continued to rule through local Soghdian Kings and  dihqan s. The ascension of the  |Abbasids|Abbasids|  to rule the Caliphate opened a new era in the history of Central Asia. While their predecessors the  |Umayyads|Umayyads|  were little more than leaders of a loose confederation of Arab tribes, the Abbasids set out to build a huge multi-ethnic centralized state that would emulate and perfect the Sassanian government machine. They gave the Near East and Transoxiana a unity, which they had been lacking since the time of Alexander the Great.            The  |Samanid_dynasty|Samanid_Dynasty|  ruled in  |Khorasan|Greater_Khorasan|   and was founded by  |Saman_Khuda|Saman_Khuda| . The Samanids were one of the first purely indigenous dynasties to rule in Persia after the Muslim Arab conquest. During the reign of Saman Khudas great-grandson, Ismail I , Samanids expanded in Khorasan. In 900, Ismail defeated the Saffarids in Khorasan , while his brother was the governor of Transoxiana. Thus, Samanid rule was acclaimed over the combined regions. The cities of  |Bukhara|Bukhara|  and Samarkand became centres of art, science, and literature; industries included pottery making and bronze casting. After 950, Samanid power weakened, but was briefly revitalized under Nuh II, who ruled from 976 to 997. However, with the oncoming encroachment of Muslim  |Turks|Turkic_Peoples| , the Samanids lost their domains south of the  |Oxus_river|Oxus_River|  which were taken by  |Ghaznavids|Ghaznavids| . In 999, Bukhara was taken by the  |Qarakhanids|Qarakhanids| . The Samanid  |Ismail_Muntasir|Ismail_Muntasir|  tried to restore the dynasty , until he was assassinated by an Arab  |bedouin|Bedouin|  chieftain.      The attack of the Qarakhanid Turks ended the Samanid dynasty in 999 and dominance in Transoxiana passed on to Turkic rulers.       After the collapse of Samanid Dynasty, Central Asia became the battleground of many Asian invaders who came from the north-east.         The  |Mongol_Empire|Mongol_Empire|  swept through Central Asia, invaded  |Khwarezmian_Empire|Khwarezmian_Empire|  and sacked the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, looting and massacring people everywhere.       Timur, founder of the  |Timurid_Empire|Timurid_Empire| , was born on 8 April 1336 in  |Kesh|Shahrisabz|  near Samarkand. He was a member of the Turkicized Barlas tribe, a Mongol subgroup that had settled in  |Transoxiana|Transoxiana|  after taking part in  |Genghis_Khans|Genghis_Khan|  son  |Chagatais|Chagatai_Khan|  campaigns in that region. Timur began his life as a bandit leader. During this period, he received an arrow-wound in the leg, as a result of which he was nicknamed Timur-e Lang or Timur the Lame. Although the last Timurid ruler of Herat, Badi az Zaman finally fell to the armies of the Uzbek Muhammad Shaibani Khan in 1506, the Timurid ruler of Ferghana, Zahir-ud-Din  |Babur|Babur| , survived the collapse of the dynasty and re-established the  |Timurid_dynasty|Timurid_Dynasty|  in India in 1526 where they became known as the  |Mughals|Mughal_Empire| .         The  |Shaybanid|Shaybanid|  state was divided into  |appanages|Appanage|  between all male members of the dynasty, who would designate the supreme ruler , the oldest member of clan. The seat of Khan was first Samarkand, the capital of the Timurids, but some of the Khans preferred to remain in their former appanages. Thus Bukhara became the seat of the khan for the first time under Ubaid Allah Khan .     The period of political expansion and economical prosperity was short-lived. Soon after the death of Abd Allah Khan the Shaibanid dynasty died out and was replaced by the Janid or  |Astrakhanid|Astrakhanid|  dynasty, another branch of the descendants of  |Jöchi|Jochi| , whose founder Jani Khan was related to Abd Allah Khan Through his marriage to Abdullah Khans Sister. The Astrakhanids are also said to be connected to the  |Hashemites|Hashemites|  due to Imam Quli Khans status as a  |Sayyid|Sayyid| . Their descendants today live in  |India|India| . In 1709, eastern part of  |Khanate_of_Bukhara|Khanate_Of_Bukhara|  seceded and formed  |Khanate_of_Kokand|Khanate_Of_Kokand| . Thus, the eastern part of present Tajikistan passed to the Khanate of Kokand, while the western one remained part of the Khanate of Bukhara.       In 1740, the Janid khanate was conquered by  |Nader_Shah|Nader_Shah| , the  |Afsharid|Afsharid_Dynasty|  ruler of  |Persia|Persia| . The Janid khan Abu al Faiz retained his throne, becoming Nadirs vassal.     After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, the chief of the  |Manghit|Manghit|  tribe, Muhammad Rahim Biy Azaliq, overcame his rivals from other tribes and consolidated his rule in the  |Khanate_of_Bukhara|Khanate_Of_Bukhara| . His successor, however, ruled in the name of puppet khans of Janid origin. In 1785 Shah Murad formalized the familys dynastic rule , and the khanate became the Emirate of Bukhara  |Soucek,_Svat|Svat_Soucek| . A History of Inner Asia , p. 180.

The expansion was motivated by Russias economic interests and was connected with the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  in the early 1860s, which severely interrupted the supply of cotton fiber to the Russian industry and forced Russia to turn to Central Asia as an alternative source of cotton supply as well as a market for Russian made goods.

Russian Empire, being a much bigger state with a huge population and having an advanced military, had little difficulty in conquering the regions inhabited by Tajiks, meeting fierce resistance only at  |Jizzakh|Jizzakh| ,  |Ura-Tyube|Ura-Tyube| , and when their garrison in  |Samarkand|Samarkand|  was besieged in 1868 by forces from  |Shahr-e_Sabz|Shahr-E_Sabz|  and the inhabitants of the city. The army of the  |Emirate_of_Bukhara|Emirate_Of_Bukhara|  was utterly defeated in three battles, and on 18 June 1868 Emir Mozaffar al-Din signed a peace treaty with the Governor-General of Russian Turkestan Von Kaufman. Samarkand and the Upper  |Zeravshan|Zeravshan|  were annexed by Russia and the country was opened to Russian merchants. The  |emir|Emir|  retained his throne as a vassal of Russia and with Russian help he established control over  |Shahr-e_Sabz|Shahr-E_Sabz| , the mountainous regions in the upper Zeravshan Valley and the principalities of the western Pamir .     During the late 19th century the  |Jadid|Jadid| ists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region. Although the Jadidists were pro-modernization and not necessarily anti-Russian the Russians viewed the movement as a threat. anti-Russian, tsarist officials in Turkestan found their kind of education even more threatening than traditional Islamic teaching, A Country Study: Tajikistan, Tajikistan under Russian Rule, Library of Congress Call Number DK851 .K34 1997,  Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913. Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in  |Khujand|Khujand|  over the threat of forced  |conscription|Conscription|  during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . Despite Russian troops quickly bringing Khujand back under control, clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in Tajikistan.     At the end of August 1920 the last emir, Sayyid Alim Khan, was overthrown by Soviet troops. On 6 October 1920 the emirate was abolished and the  |Bukharan_Peoples_Soviet_Republic|Bukharan_Peoples_Soviet_Republic|  was proclaimed.             The  |Basmachi_movement|Basmachi_Movement|  or Basmachi Revolt was an uprising against  |Russian_Imperial|Russian_Empire|  and  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  rule that arose after the  |Russian_Revolution|Russian_Revolution|  of 1917 guerrillas throughout Central Asia.     The movements roots lay in the anti-conscription violence of 1916 that erupted when the Russian Empire began to draft Muslims for army service during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .

Living standards were undermined during the tenure of Kahar Mahkamov as first secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan from 1985. Mahkamovs attempted marketisation of the Tajik economy aggravated the poor living conditions and unemployment. On the eve of the Soviet collapse Tajikistan was suffering from a declining economy and dim prospects for recovery. The  |glasnost|Glasnost|  policy of openness initiated by  |Mikhil_Gorbachev|Mikhil_Gorbachev|  offered disgruntled Tajiks a chance to voice their grievances.

On September 9 , following the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , Tajikistan declared its independence. During this time, use of the  |Tajik_language|Tajik_Language| , an official language of the Tajikistan SSR next to Russian, was increasingly promoted. Ethnic Russians, who had held many governing posts, lost much of their influence and more Tajiks became politically active.     The nation almost immediately fell into a civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. The non-Muslim population, particularly Russians and Jews, fled the country during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics.      |Emomali_Rahmon|Emomali_Rahmon|  came to power in 1994, and continues to rule to this day.
