      Arthur Blind Blake was an American  |blues|Blues|  and  |ragtime|Ragtime|  singer and guitarist. He is known for numerous recordings he made for  |Paramount_Records|Paramount_Records|  between 1926 and 1932.       Little is known of Blakes life. Promotional materials from  |Paramount_Records|Paramount_Records|  indicate he was born blind and give his birthplace as  |Jacksonville_Florida|Jacksonville_Florida| , and it seems that he lived there during various periods. He seems to have had relatives in  |Patterson_Georgia|Patterson_Georgia| . Some authors have written that in one recording he slipped into a  |Geechee|Geechee|  or  |Gullah|Gullah|  dialect, suggesting a connection with the  |Sea_Islands|Sea_Islands| .  |Blind_Willie_McTell|Blind_Willie_Mctell|  indicated that Blakes real name was Arthur Phelps, but later research has shown this is unlikely to be correct.

In 2011 a group of researchers led by Alex van der Tuuk published various documents regarding Blakes life and death in the journal Blues & Rhythm. One of these documents is his 1934 death certificate, which states he was born in 1896 in  |Newport_News_Virginia|Newport_News_Virginia| , to Winter and Alice Blake . Nothing else is known of Blake until the 1920s, when he emerged as a recording musician.        Blake recorded about 80 tracks for  |Paramount_Records|Paramount_Records|  from 1926 to 1932.  He was one of the most accomplished guitarists of his genre and played a diverse range of material. He is best known for his distinctive guitar playing, which was comparable in sound and style to  |ragtime|Ragtime|  piano.  He seems to have lived in Jacksonville and to have gone to  |Chicago|Chicago|  for his recording sessions, at one point having an apartment at 31st Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. According to van der Tuuk et al., he apparently returned to Florida for the winter. In the 1930s he was reported to be playing in front of a Jacksonville hotel.       Blake married Beatrice McGee around 1931. In the following year he made his final recording at the Paramount headquarters, in  |Grafton_Wisconsin|Grafton_Wisconsin| , just before the label went out of business. For decades nothing was known of him after this point, and it was rumored that he met with a violent death;  |Reverend_Gary_Davis|Reverend_Gary_Davis|  heard he had been hit by a  |streetcar|Streetcar|  in 1934. The research of van der Tuuk et al. suggests that Blake stayed in Wisconsin, living in  |Milwaukees|Milwaukee| |_Brewers_Hill|Brewers_Hill|  neighborhood, where Paramount boarded many of its artists. He seems not to have found work as a musician. In April 1933 he was hospitalized with  |pneumonia|Pneumonia|  and never fully recovered. On December 1, 1934, after three weeks of decline, Beatrice Blake summoned an ambulance. He suffered a  |pulmonary_hemorrhage|Pulmonary_Hemorrhage|  and died on the way to the hospital. The cause of death was listed as  |pulmonary_tuberculosis|Pulmonary_Tuberculosis| . He was buried in Glen Oaks Cemetery, in  |Glendale_Wisconsin|Glendale_Wisconsin| .       Blakes first recordings were made in 1926,  and his  |records|Gramophone_Record|  sold well. His first solo record was Early Morning Blues , with West Coast Blues on the  |B_side|A_Side_And_B_Side| . Both are considered excellent examples of his ragtime-based guitar style and were prototypes for the burgeoning  |Piedmont_blues|Piedmont_Blues| . Blake made his last recordings in 1932; his career ended with Paramounts bankruptcy. Stefan Grossman and Gayle Dean Wardlow have suggested it is possible that only one side of Blakes last record is actually by him; Jas Obrecht 1993 Champagne Charlie Is My Name does not sound like Blakes playing or singing.     His complex and intricate fingerpicking inspired  |Reverend_Gary_Davis|Reverend_Gary_Davis| ,  |Jorma_Kaukonen|Jorma_Kaukonen| ,  |Ry_Cooder|Ry_Cooder| ,  |Arlen_Roth|Arlen_Roth| ,  |John_Fahey|John_Fahey| ,  |Ralph_McTell|Ralph_Mctell| , David Bromberg,  |Leon_Redbone|Leon_Redbone|  and many others.     The title track of  |Bob_Dylans|Bob_Dylan|  1992 album  Good As I Been to You  is a cover of Blind Blakes You Gonna Quit Me Blues.     The French singer-songwriter  |Francis_Cabrel|Francis_Cabrel|  refers to Blake in the song Cent Ans de Plus , on the 1999 album Hors-Saison.
