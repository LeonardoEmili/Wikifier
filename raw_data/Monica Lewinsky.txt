She wrote an essay in the March 2018 issue of Vanity Fair in which she did not directly explain why she used the MeToo hashtag in October. She did write that looking back at her relationship with Bill Clinton, although it was consensual, because he was 27 years older than her and in a position with a lot more power than she had, in her opinion the relationship constituted an abuse of power on Clintons part. She added that she had been diagnosed with  |post_traumatic_stress_disorder|Post_Traumatic_Stress_Disorder|  due to the experiences involved after the relationship was disclosed.

A spokesman for the  |Israel_Television_News_Company|Israel_Television_News_Company| , which hosted the conference and is Levis employer, responded that Levi had kept all the agreements she made with Lewinsky and honored her requests.
