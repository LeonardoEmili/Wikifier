Inspired by the  |farces|Farce|  of the  |ancient_Roman|Ancient_Rome|  playwright  |Plautus|Plautus|  , specifically  Pseudolus ,  Miles Gloriosus , and  Mostellaria , the musical tells the bawdy story of a  |slave|Slavery|  named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of  |farce|Farce| , including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of  |mistaken_identity|Mistaken_Identity|  , and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by  |vaudeville|Vaudeville|  comedians to begin a story: A funny thing happened on the way to the theater .

The shows creators originally wanted  |Phil_Silvers|Phil_Silvers|  in the lead role of  |Pseudolus|Pseudolus| , but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit.

Green, Stanley and Green, Kay. Broadway Musicals, Show By Show , Hal Leonard Corporation, , p. 198     During the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well.  |Jerome_Robbins|Jerome_Robbins|  was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace Love Is in the Air and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song Comedy Tonight for this new opening. From that point on, the show was a success.

The production was performed by an all-male cast . Kennedy, Marina.  broadwayworld.com, November 24, 2015          In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses. In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musicals main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children .     One day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Dominas mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus . Pseudolus promises to help him win Philias love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately , Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior  |Miles_Gloriosus|Miles_Gloriosus| , who is expected to claim her very soon. Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philias cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a  |plague|Yersinia_Pestis|  from  |Crete|Crete| , which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senexs house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for that is the way of a courtesan. To appease her, he tells her to wait inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysteriums book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is mares sweat , and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.     Unexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mares sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted – a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome .     When Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senexs house; told that she has escaped, Lycus is terrified to face the Captains wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, Lycus , will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Romes winding streets.     Complicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is up to something low. She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in  |drag|Drag|  and pretending to be Philia, dead from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three Philia s . Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus   who had been recruited as mourners at Philia s ersatz funeral   have escaped, and Lycus sends his  |eunuchs|Eunuch|  out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.     Finally, the Captains troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble – but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philias betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that hes her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, shes freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all – except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.        Pseudolus Pseudolus means Faker .
