        Keith John Moon  was an English drummer for the  |rock|Rock_Music|  band  |the_Who|The_Who| . He was noted for his unique style and his eccentric, often self-destructive behaviour. His drumming continues to be praised by critics and musicians.     Moon grew up in  |Alperton|Alperton| , a suburb of  |Wembley|Wembley| , in  |Middlesex|Middlesex| , and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they recorded their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised  |tom-toms|Tom-Tom_Drum| , cymbal crashes, and  |drum_fills|Fill| . Throughout Moons tenure with the Who his drum kit steadily grew in size, and along with  |Ginger_Baker|Ginger_Baker| , Moon has been credited as one of the earliest rock drummers to regularly employ  |double_bass_drums|Double_Bass_Drumming|  in his setup. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained a member of the band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for  |smashing_his_kit|Instrument_Destruction|  on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with  |cherry_bombs|Cherry_Bomb|  or  |dynamite|Dynamite| , and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and socialising, and became bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in  |Flint,_Michigan|Flint,_Michigan| , has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.     Moon suffered a number of setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He became  |addicted_to_alcohol|Alcohol_Abuse| , particularly brandy and champagne, and acquired a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was Moon the Loon. After moving to Los Angeles with personal assistant  |Peter_Dougal_Butler|Dougal_Butler|  during the mid-1970s, Moon recorded his only solo album, the poorly received  Two Sides of the Moon . While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By their final tour with him in 1976, and particularly during production of  The Kids Are Alright  and  Who Are You , the drummers deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London in 1978, dying in September of that year from an overdose of  |Heminevrin|Clomethiazole| , a drug intended to treat or prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.            Keith John Moon was born to Alfred Charles and Kathleen Winifred Moon on 23 August 1946 at  |Central_Middlesex_Hospital|Central_Middlesex_Hospital|  in northwest London, and grew up in Wembley. He was  |hyperactive|Hyperactivity|  as a boy, with a restless imagination and a particular fondness for  The Goon Show  and music. Moon attended  |Alperton_Secondary_Modern_School|Alperton_Community_School|  after failing his  |eleven_plus_exam|Eleven_Plus_Exam| , which precluded his attending a  |grammar_school|Grammar_School| . His art teacher said in a report: Retarded artistically. Idiotic in other respects . His music teacher wrote that Moon has great ability, but must guard against a tendency to show off.      Moon joined his local  |Sea_Cadet_Corps|Sea_Cadet_Corps|  band at the age of twelve on the  |bugle|Bugle| , but found the instrument too difficult to learn and decided to take up drums instead. He was interested in practical jokes and home science kits, with a particular fondness for explosions. On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macaris Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school at age fourteen, around Easter in 1961. Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio repairman, enabling him to buy his first drum kit.           Moon took lessons from one of the loudest contemporary drummers,  |Screaming_Lord_Sutchs|Screaming_Lord_Sutch| |Carlo_Little|Carlo_Little| , at 10  |shillings|Shilling|  per lesson.  Moons early style was influenced by  |jazz|Jazz| , American  |surf_music|Surf_Music|  and  |rhythm_and_blues|Rhythm_And_Blues| , exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer  |Hal_Blaine|Hal_Blaine| . His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly  |Gene_Krupa|Gene_Krupa|  . Moon also admired  |Elvis_Presleys|Elvis_Presley|  original drummer  |DJ_Fontana|Dj_Fontana| ,  |the_Shadows|The_Shadows|  original drummer  |Tony_Meehan|Tony_Meehan|  and  |the_Pretty_Things|The_Pretty_Things| |Viv_Prince|Viv_Prince| . He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in  |Motown|Motown| .  Moon idolised  |the_Beach_Boys|The_Beach_Boys| ;  |Roger_Daltrey|Roger_Daltrey|  later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even at the peak of the Whos fame.      During this time Moon joined his first serious band: the Escorts, replacing his best friend Gerry Evans. In December 1962 he joined the Beachcombers, a semi-professional London  |cover_band|Cover_Band|  playing hits by groups such as the Shadows. During his time in the group Moon incorporated theatrical tricks into his act, including shooting the groups lead singer with a starter pistol. The Beachcombers all had day jobs; Moon, who worked in the sales department at  |British_Gypsum|British_Gypsum| , had the keenest interest in turning professional. In April 1964, at age 17, he auditioned for the Who as a replacement for  |Doug_Sandom|Doug_Sandom| . The Beachcombers continued as a local cover band after his departure.               A commonly cited story of how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandoms departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed  |ginger|Red_Hair|  ,   he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; he played in the sets second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guys drums and did one song-Road Runner. Id several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: You ... come ere. I said, mild as you please: Yes, yes? And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: What are you doing next Monday? I said: Nothing. I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: Youll have to give up work ... theres this gig on Monday. If you want to come, well pick you up in the van. I said: Right. And that was it.  Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had just been filling in for the last fifteen years.      Moons arrival in the Who changed the dynamics of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moons temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. We used to fight regularly, remembered Moon in later years.  |John_[Entwistle|John_Entwistle|  and I used to have fights  â€“ it wasnt very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing.  Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music, he said in a later interview.  Although Townshend described him as a completely different person to anyone Ive ever met,  the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moons drumming style affected the bands musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moons lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.     Moon was particularly fond of touring, since it was his only chance to regularly socialise with his bandmates, and was generally restless and bored when not playing live. This later carried over to other aspects of his life, as he acted them out  as if his life were one long tour.  These antics earned him the nickname Moon the Loon.             Moons style of drumming was considered unique by his bandmates, although they sometimes found his unconventional playing frustrating; Entwistle noted that he tended to play faster or slower according to his mood. He wouldnt play across his kit, he later added. Hed play zig-zag. Thats why he had two sets of tom-toms. Hed move his arms forward like a skier.  Daltrey said that Moon just instinctively put drum fills in places that other people would never have thought of putting them.      Who biographer John Atkins wrote that the groups early test sessions for  |Pye_Records|Pye_Records|  in 1964 show that they seemed to have understood just how important was  ... Moons contribution.  Contemporary critics questioned his ability to keep time, with biographer  |Tony_Fletcher|Tony_Fletcher|  suggesting that the timing on  Tommy  was all over the place. Who producer Jon Astley said, You didnt think he was keeping time, but he was.  Early recordings of Moons drumming sound tinny and disorganised;  it was not until the recording of  Whos Next , with  |Glyn_Johns|Glyn_Johns|  no-nonsense production techniques and the need to keep time to a synthesizer track, that he began developing more discipline in the studio. Fletcher considers the drumming on this album to be the best of Moons career.     Unlike contemporary rock drummers such as  |Ginger_Baker|Ginger_Baker|  and  |John_Bonham|John_Bonham| , Moon hated drum solos and refused to play them in concert. At a  |Madison_Square_Garden|Madison_Square_Garden|  show on  |10_June_1974|The_Who_Tour_1974| , Townshend and Entwistle decided to spontaneously stop playing during Wasp Man to listen to Moons drum solo. Moon continued briefly and then stopped, shouting Drum solos are boring!  On 23 June 1977, he made a guest appearance at a  |Led_Zeppelin|Led_Zeppelin|  concert in Los Angeles.           Although not an especially gifted vocalist, Moon was enthusiastic about singing and wanted to sing lead with the rest of the group. While the other three members handled most of the onstage vocals, Moon would attempt to sing backup . He provided humorous commentary during song announcements, although sound engineer Bob Pridden preferred to mute his vocal microphone on the  |mixing_desk|Mixing_Desk|  whenever possible.  Moons knack for making his bandmates laugh around the microphone led them to banish him from the studio when vocals were being recorded; this led to a game in which Moon would sneak in to join the singing.  At the end of  |Happy_Jack|Happy_Jack| , Townshend can be heard saying I saw ya! to Moon as he tries to sneak into the studio. The drummers interest in surf music and his desire to sing lead spawned lead vocals on several early tracks, including  |Bucket_T|Bucket_T|  and  |Barbara_Ann|Barbara_Ann|   and high backing vocals on other songs, such as  |Pictures_of_Lily|Pictures_Of_Lily| . Moons performance on  |Bell_Boy|Bell_Boy|   saw him abandon serious vocal performances to sing in character, which gave him full licence to live up to his reputation as a lecherous drunk ; it was exactly the kind of performance the Who needed from him to bring them back down to earth.      Moon composed I Need You , the instrumental Cobwebs and Strange , the single B-sides In The City  and Girls Eyes , Dogs Part Two , Tommys Holiday Camp  and  |Waspman|Waspman|  . Moon also co-composed  |The_Ox|The_Ox|   with Townshend, Entwistle and keyboardist  |Nicky_Hopkins|Nicky_Hopkins| . The setting for Tommys Holiday Camp  was credited to Moon; the song was primarily written by Townshend and, although there is a misconception that Moon sings on it, the album version is Townshends demo.      The drummer produced the violin solo on  |Baba_ORiley|Baba_Oriley| .  Moon sat in on congas with  |East_of_Eden|East_Of_Eden|  at the  |Lyceum|Lyceum| , and afterwards suggested to violinist  |Dave_Arbus|Dave_Arbus|  that he play on the track.                Moon played a four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. Throughout much of 1964 and 1965 his setups consisted of  |Ludwig|Ludwig-Musser|  drums and  |Zildjian|Zildjian|  cymbals. Moon began to endorse  |Premier_Drums|Premier_Drums|  in late 1965, and he remained a loyal customer of the company. His first Premier kit was in red sparkle and featured two high toms. In 1966 he moved to an even larger kit, but without the customary  |hi-hat|Hi-Hat| â€”at the time Moon preferred keeping backbeats with  |ride|Ride_Cymbals|  and  |crash|Crash_Cymbals| |cymbals|Cymbals| . His new larger configuration was notable for the presence of two bass drums. Moon, along with  |Ginger_Baker|Ginger_Baker| , has been credited as one of the early pioneers of  |double_bass_drumming|Double_Bass_Drumming|  in rock.  This kit was not used at the Whos performance at the 1967  |Monterey_Pop_Festival|Monterey_Pop_Festival| . From 1967 to 1969 Moon used the Pictures of Lily drum kit , which had two  bass drums, two  floor toms and three mounted toms. In recognition of his loyalty to the company, Premier reissued the kit in 2006 as the Spirit of Lily.      By 1970 Moon had begun to use  |timbales|Timbales| , gongs and timpani, and these were included in his setup for the rest of his career. In 1973 Premiers marketing manager, Eddie Haynes, began consulting with Moon about specific requirements. At one point, Moon asked Premier to make a white kit with gold-plated fittings. When Haynes said that it would be prohibitively expensive, Moon replied: Dear boy, do exactly as you feel it should be, but thats the way I want it. The kit was eventually fitted with copper fittings and later given to a young  |Zak_Starkey|Zak_Starkey| .       At an early show at the Railway Tavern in  |Harrow|Harrow,_London| , Townshend  |smashed_his_guitar|Instrument_Destruction|  after accidentally breaking it. When the audience demanded he do it again, Moon kicked over his drum kit. Subsequent live sets culminated in what the band later described as  |auto-destructive_art|Auto-Destructive_Art| , in which band members elaborately destroyed their equipment. Moon developed a habit of kicking over his drums, claiming that he did so in exasperation at an audiences indifference. Townshend later said, A set of skins is about $300 and after every show hed just go bang, bang, bang and then kick the whole thing over.      In May 1966, Moon discovered that  |the_Beach_Boys|The_Beach_Boys| |Bruce_Johnston|Bruce_Johnston|  was visiting London. After the pair socialised for a few days, Moon and Entwistle brought Johnston to the set of  Ready Steady Go! , which made them late for a show with the Who that evening. During the finale of My Generation, an altercation broke out on stage between Moon and Townshend which was reported on the front page of the  New Musical Express  the following week. Moon and Entwistle left the Who for a week , but they changed their minds and returned.     On the Whos early US package tour at the  |RKO_Theatre|Center_Theatre|  in New York in March and April 1967 Moon performed five shows a day, kicking over his drum kit after every show. Later that year, during their appearance on  The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , he bribed a stagehand to load gunpowder into one of his bass drums; the stagehand used about ten times the standard amount. During the finale of  |My_Generation|My_Generation| , he kicked the drum off the riser and set off the charge. The intensity of the explosion singed Townshends hair and embedded a piece of cymbal in Moons arm. A clip of the incident became the opening scene for the film The Kids Are Alright.      Although Moon was known for kicking over his drum kit, Haynes claimed that it was done carefully and the kit rarely needed repairs. However, stands and foot pedals were frequently replaced; the drummer would go through them like a knife through butter.                 While Moon generally said he was only interested in working with the Who, he participated in outside musical projects. In 1966 he worked with  |Yardbirds|Yardbirds|  guitarist  |Jeff_Beck|Jeff_Beck| , pianist  |Nicky_Hopkins|Nicky_Hopkins|  and future  |Led_Zeppelin|Led_Zeppelin|  members  |Jimmy_Page|Jimmy_Page|  and  |John_Paul_Jones|John_Paul_Jones|  on the instrumental  |Becks_Bolero|Becks_Bolero| , which was the B-side to  |Hi_Ho_Silver_Lining|Hi_Ho_Silver_Lining|  and appeared on the album  Truth . Moon also played  |timpani|Timpani|  on another track, a cover of  |Jerome_Kerns|Jerome_Kern| |Ol_Man_River|Ol_Man_River| . He was credited on the album as You Know Who.      Moon may have inspired the name for Led Zeppelin. When he briefly considered leaving the Who in 1966, he spoke with Entwistle and Page about forming a  |supergroup|Supergroup| . Moon remarked that a particular suggestion had gone down like a lead  |zeppelin|Zeppelin|  . Although the supergroup was never formed, Page remembered the phrase and later adapted it as the name of his new band.      |The_Beatles|The_Beatles|  became friends with Moon, leading to occasional collaborations. In 1967, he contributed backing vocals to  |All_You_Need_Is_Love|All_You_Need_Is_Love| .  On 15 December 1969, Moon joined  |John_Lennons|John_Lennon| |Plastic_Ono_Band|Plastic_Ono_Band|  for a live performance at the  |Lyceum_Theatre|Lyceum_Theatre,_London|  in London for a  |UNICEF|Unicef|  charity concert. In 1972 the performance was released as a companion disc to Lennon and Onos album,  Some Time in New York City .      Moons friendship with Entwistle led to an appearance on  Smash Your Head Against the Wall , Entwistles first solo album and the first by a member of the Who. Moon did not play drums on the album;  |Jerry_Shirley|Jerry_Shirley|  did, with Moon providing percussion.  Rolling Stones John Hoegel appreciated Entwistles decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.      Moon became involved in solo work when he moved to Los Angeles during the mid-1970s. In 1974,  |Track_Records|Track_Records| -MCA released a Moon solo single covering  |the_Beach_Boys|The_Beach_Boys| |Dont_Worry,_Baby|Dont_Worry,_Baby|  and Teenage Idol. The next year he released his only solo album, entitled  Two Sides of the Moon . Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others . The album was received poorly by critics.  NME s Roy Carr wrote, Moonie, if you didnt have talent, I wouldnt care; but you have, which is why Im not about to accept Two Sides of the Moon.  Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in Rolling Stone, wrote: There isnt any legitimate reason for this albums existence.  During one of his few televised solo drum performances , Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed as a cat on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and  |goldfish|Goldfish| . When asked by an audience member what would happen to the kit, he joked that even the best drummers get hungry.  His performance was not appreciated by animal lovers, several of whom called the station with complaints.       In the 2007 documentary film,  Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who , Daltrey and Townshend reminisced about Moons talent for dressing as a variety of characters. They remembered his dream of getting out of music and becoming a Hollywood film actor,  although Daltrey did not think Moon had the patience and work ethic required by a professional actor. Who manager Bill Curbishley agreed that Moon wasnt disciplined enough to actually turn up or commit to doing the stuff.      Nevertheless, the drummer landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a  |cameo|Cameo_Role|  in  |Frank_Zappas|Frank_Zappa|   200 Motels  as a nun afraid of dying from a drug overdose. Although it only took 13 days to film, fellow cast member  |Howard_Kaylan|Howard_Kaylan|  remembers Moon spending off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moons next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stray Cats at a holiday camp during the early days of  |British_rock_n_roll|British_Rock| , in 1973s  Thatll Be the Day . He reprised the role for the films 1974 sequel,  Stardust , and played Uncle Ernie in  |Ken_Russells|Ken_Russell| |1975_film_adaptation_of_Tommy|Tommy| .  Moons last film appearance was in 1978s  Sextette  with Starr and  |Alice_Cooper|Alice_Cooper| . This was the last film to star  |Mae_West|Mae_West| .            Moon led a destructive lifestyle. During the Whos early days he began taking  |amphetamines|Amphetamines| , and in a  New Musical Express  interview said his favourite food was  |French_Blues|Dexamyl| .  He spent his share of the bands income quickly, and was a regular at London clubs such as the  |Speakeasy|Speakeasy_Club|  and the  |Bag_O_Nails|The_Bag_Onails| ; the combination of pills and alcohol escalated into alcoholism and drug addiction later in his life. went through the same stages everybody goes through  â€“ the bloody drug corridor, he later reflected. Drinking suited the group a lot better.      According to Townshend, Moon began destroying hotel rooms when the Who stayed at the  |Berlin|Berlin|  Hilton on tour in late 1966. In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends homes and even his own, throwing furniture from upper-storey windows and lighting fires. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing cost as much as Â£300,000 . These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moons way of demonstrating his eccentricity; he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant Butler observed, He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny, he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far. Like a train ride you couldnt stop.      In a limousine on the way to the airport Moon insisted they return to their hotel, saying I forgot something. At the hotel he ran back to his room, grabbed the television and threw it out the window into the swimming pool below. He then jumped back into the limo, saying I nearly forgot.      Fletcher argues that The Whos lengthy break between the end of  |their_1972_European_tour|The_Who_Tour_1972|  and the beginning of the  Quadrophenia  sessions devastated Moons health, as without the rigours of lengthy shows and regular touring that had previously kept him in shape, his hard-partying lifestyle took a greater toll on his body. He did not keep a drum kit or practise at  |Tara|Tara,_Chertsey| , and began to deteriorate physically as a result of his lifestyle. Around the same time he became a severe  |alcoholic|Alcoholism| , starting the day with drinks and changing from the lovable boozer he presented himself as to a boorish drunk .  |David_Puttnam|David_Puttnam|  recalled, The drinking went from being a joke to being a problem. On  Thatll Be the Day  it was social drinking. By the time  Stardust  came round it was hard drinking.        Moons favourite stunt was to flush powerful explosives down toilets. According to Fletcher, Moons toilet pyrotechnics began in 1965 when he purchased a case of 500  |cherry_bombs|Cherry_Bomb| . He moved from cherry bombs to  |M-80|M-80|  fireworks to sticks of  |dynamite|Dynamite| , which became his explosive of choice.  All that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable, Moon remembered. I never realised dynamite was so powerful. Id been used to penny bangers before.  He quickly developed a reputation for destroying bathrooms and blowing up toilets. The destruction mesmerised him, and enhanced his public image as rocks premier hell-raiser. Tony Fletcher wrote that no toilet in a hotel or changing room was safe until Moon had exhausted his supply of explosives.     Pete Townshend walked into the bathroom of Moons hotel room and noticed the toilet had disappeared, with only the S-bend remaining. The drummer explained that since a cherry bomb was about to explode, he had thrown it down the loo and showed Townshend the case of cherry bombs. And of course from that moment on, the guitarist remembered, we got thrown out of every hotel we ever stayed in.      Entwistle recalled being close to Moon on tour: I suppose we were two of a kind ...  We shared a room on the road and got up to no good. Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets. In a 1981  Los Angeles Times  interview he admitted, A lot of times when Keith was blowing up toilets I was standing behind him with the matches.  In  |Alabama|Alabama| , Moon and Entwistle loaded a toilet with cherry bombs after being denied room service. According to Entwistle, That toilet was just dust all over the walls by the time we checked out. The management brought our suitcases down to the gig and said: Dont come back  ...      A hotel manager called Moon in his room and asked him to lower the volume on his cassette recorder because it made too much noise. In response the drummer asked him up to his room, excused himself to go to the bathroom, put a lit stick of dynamite in the toilet and shut the bathroom door. Upon returning, he asked the manager to stay for a moment, as he wanted to explain something. Following the explosion, Moon turned the recorder back on and said, That, dear boy, was noise. This is the Oo.             On 23 August 1967, on tour opening for  |Hermans_Hermits|Hermans_Hermits| , Moon celebrated what he said was his 21st birthday at a  |Holiday_Inn|Holiday_Inn|  in  |Flint,_Michigan|Flint,_Michigan| . Entwistle later said, He decided that if it was a publicised fact that it was his 21st birthday, he would be able to drink.      The drummer immediately began drinking upon his arrival in Flint. The Who spent the afternoon visiting local radio stations with Nancy Lewis , and Moon posed for a photo outside the hotel in front of a Happy Birthday Keith sign put up by the hotel management. According to Lewis, Moon was drunk by the time the band went onstage at  |Atwood_Stadium|Atwood_Stadium| .     Returning to the hotel, Moon started a food fight and soon cake began flying through the air. The drummer knocked out part of his front tooth; at the hospital, doctors could not give him an anaesthetic before removing the remainder of the tooth. Back at the hotel a mÃªlÃ©e erupted; fire extinguishers were set off, guests thrown into the swimming pool and a piano reportedly destroyed. The chaos ended only when police arrived with guns drawn.     A furious Holiday Inn management presented the groups with a bill for $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Hermans Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life from all of the hotels properties, but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in  |Rochester,_New_York|Rochester,_New_York|  a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a  |Lincoln_Continental|Lincoln_Continental|  into the hotels swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 Rolling Stone interview.            Moons lifestyle began to undermine his health and reliability. During the 1973  |Quadrophenia|Quadrophenia|  tour, at the Whos debut US date at the  |Cow_Palace|Cow_Palace|  in  |Daly_City,_California|Daly_City,_California| , Moon ingested a mixture of  |tranquillisers|Tranquilliser|  and  |brandy|Brandy| . During the concert, Moon passed out on his drum kit during  |Wont_Get_Fooled_Again|Wont_Get_Fooled_Again| . The band stopped playing, and a group of  |roadies|Road_Crew|  carried Moon offstage. They gave him a shower and an injection of  |cortisone|Cortisone| , sending him back onstage after a thirty-minute delay.  Moon passed out again during  |Magic_Bus|Magic_Bus| , and was again removed from the stage. The band continued without him for several songs before Townshend asked, Can anyone play the drums? â€“ I mean somebody good? A drummer in the audience,  |Scot_Halpin|Scot_Halpin| , came up and played the rest of the show.     During the opening date of the bands March 1976 US tour at the  |Boston_Garden|Boston_Garden| , Moon passed out over his drum kit after two numbers and the show was rescheduled. The next evening Moon systematically destroyed everything in his hotel room, cut himself doing so and passed out. He was discovered by manager Bill Curbishley, who took him to a hospital, telling him Im gonna get the doctor to get you nice and fit, so youre back within two days. Because I want to break your fucking jaw  ... You have fucked this band around so many times and Im not having it any more.  Doctors told Curbishley that if he had not intervened, Moon would have bled to death. Marsh suggested that at this point Daltrey and Entwistle seriously considered firing Moon, but decided that doing so would make his life worse.     Entwistle has said that Moon and the Who reached their live peak in 1975â€“76. At the end of the 1976 US tour in Miami that August, the drummer, delirious, was treated in Hollywood Memorial Hospital for eight days. The group was concerned that he would be unable to complete the last leg of the tour, which ended at  |Maple_Leaf_Gardens|Maple_Leaf_Gardens|  in Toronto on 21 October . During the bands recording sabbatical between 1976 and 1978, Moon gained a considerable amount of weight. By the time of the Whos invitation-only show at the  |Gaumont_State_Cinema|Gaumont_State_Cinema|  on 15 December 1977 for The Kids are Alright, Moon was visibly overweight and had difficulty sustaining a solid performance. After recording  Who Are You , Townshend refused to follow the album with a tour unless Moon stopped drinking, and said that if Moons playing did not improve he would be fired. Daltrey later denied threatening to fire him, but said that by this time the drummer was out of control.       Because the Whos early stage act relied on smashing instruments, and owing to Moons enthusiasm for damaging hotels, the group were in debt for much of the 1960s; Entwistle estimated they lost about Â£150,000. Even when the group became relatively financially stable after Tommy, Moon continued to rack up debts. He bought a number of cars and gadgets, and flirted with bankruptcy. Moons recklessness with money reduced his profit from the groups 1975 UK tour to Â£47.35 .           Before the 1998 release of Tony Fletchers Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon, Moons date of birth was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This erroneous date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who. The incorrect date had been supplied by Moon in interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.          Moons first serious relationship was with  |Kim_Kerrigan|Kim_Kerrigan| , whom he started dating in January 1965 after she saw the Who play at  |Le_Disque_a_Go!_Go!|The_Downstairs_Club|  in Bournemouth. By the end of the year, she discovered she was pregnant; her parents, who were furious, met with the Moons to discuss their options and she moved into the Moon family home in Wembley. They were married on 17 March 1966 at Brent Registry Office, and their daughter Amanda was born on 12 July. The marriage were kept secret from the press until May 1968. Moon was occasionally violent towards Kim: if we went out after I had Mandy, she later said, if someone talked to me, hed lose it. Wed go home and hed start a fight with me.  He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. He had no idea how to be a father, Kim said. He was too much of a child himself.      From 1971 to 1975 Moon owned  |Tara|Tara,_Chertsey| , a home in Chertsey where he initially lived with his wife and daughter. The Moons entertained extravagantly at home, and owned a number of cars. Jack McCullogh, then working for  |Track_Records|Track_Records|  , recalls Moon ordering him to purchase a  |milk_float|Milk_Float|  to store in the garage at Tara.     In 1973 Kim, convinced that neither she nor anyone else could moderate Keiths behaviour, left her husband and took Amanda; she sued for divorce in 1975 and later married  |Faces|Faces|  keyboard player  |Ian_McLagan|Ian_Mclagan| . Marsh believes that Moon never truly recovered from the loss of his family. Butler agrees; despite his relationship with Annette Walter-Lax, he believes that Kim was the only woman Moon loved. McLagan commented that Moon couldnt handle it.  Moon would harass them with phone calls, and on one occasion before Kim sued for divorce, he invited McLagan for a drink at a  |Richmond|Richmond,_London|  pub and sent several heavies to break into McLagans home on Fife Road and look for Kim, forcing her to hide in a walk-in closet. She died in a car accident in  |Austin,_Texas|Austin,_Texas| , on 2 August 2006.        In 1975 Moon began a relationship with Swedish model  |Annette_Walter-Lax|Annette_Walter-Lax| , who later said that Moon was so sweet when he was sober, that I was just living with him in the hope that he would kick all this craziness.  She begged  |Malibu|Malibu,_California|  neighbour  |Larry_Hagman|Larry_Hagman|  to check Moon into a clinic to dry out , but when doctors recorded Moons chemical intake at breakfast â€“ a bottle of champagne,  |Courvoisier|Courvoisier|  and  |amphetamines|Amphetamines|  â€“ they concluded that there was no hope for his rehabilitation.            Moon enjoyed being the life of the party. Bill Curbishley remembered that he wouldnt walk into any room and just listen. He was an attention seeker and he had to have it.      Early in the Whos career, Moon got to know  |the_Beatles|The_Beatles| . He would join them at clubs, forming a particularly close friendship with  |Ringo_Starr|Ringo_Starr| . Moon later became friends with  |Bonzo_Dog_Doo-Dah_Band|Bonzo_Dog_Doo-Dah_Band|  members  |Vivian_Stanshall|Vivian_Stanshall|  and  |Legs_Larry_Smith|Larry_Smith| , and the trio would drink and play practical jokes together. Smith remembers one occasion where he and Moon tore apart a pair of trousers, with an accomplice later looking for one-legged trousers. In the early 1970s Moon helped Stanshall with his Radio Flashes radio show for  |BBC_Radio_1|Bbc_Radio_1| , filling in for the vacationing  |John_Peel|John_Peel|  . Moon filled in for Peel in 1973s A Touch of the Moon , a series of four programmes produced by  |John_Walters|John_Walters| .      Guitarist  |Joe_Walsh|Joe_Walsh|  enjoyed socialising with Moon. In an interview with Guitar World magazine, he recalled that the drummer taught me how to break things.  In 1974, Moon struck up a friendship with actor  |Oliver_Reed|Oliver_Reed|  while working on  |the_film_version_of_Tommy|Tommy| . Although Reed matched Moon drink for drink, he appeared on set the next morning ready to perform; Moon, on the other hand, would cost several hours of filming time. Reed later said that Moon showed me the way to insanity.           Peter Dougal Butler began working for the Who in 1967, becoming Moons personal assistant the following year  to help him stay out of trouble. He remembers managers  |Kit_Lambert|Kit_Lambert|  and  |Chris_Stamp|Chris_Stamp|  saying, We trust you with Keith but if you ever want any time off, for a holiday or some sort of rest, let us know and well pay for it. Butler never took them up on the offer.     He followed Moon when the drummer relocated to Los Angeles, but felt that the drug culture prevalent at the time was bad for Moon: My job was to have eyes in the back of my head. Townshend agreed, saying that by 1975 Butler had no influence over him whatsoever.  Although he was a loyal companion to Moon, the lifestyle eventually became too much for him; he phoned Curbishley, saying that they needed to move back to England or one of them might die. Butler quit in 1978, and later wrote of his experiences in a book entitled Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of Keith Moon.       On 4 January 1970 Moon accidentally killed his friend, driver and  |bodyguard|Bodyguard| , Neil Boland, outside the Red Lion pub in  |Hatfield,_Hertfordshire|Hatfield,_Hertfordshire| . Pub patrons had begun to attack his  |Bentley|Bentley|  and Moon, drunk, began driving to escape them. During the fracas, he hit Boland. After an investigation, the  |coroner|Coroner|  ruled Bolands death an accident and Moon received an  |absolute_discharge|Absolute_Discharge|  after being charged with a number of offences.     Those close to Moon said that he was haunted by Bolands death for the rest of his life. According to  |Pamela_Des_Barres|Pamela_Des_Barres| , Moon had nightmares about the incident and said he had no right to be alive.             In mid-1978 Moon moved into Flat 12, 9  |Curzon_Place|Curzon_Place|  ,  |Shepherd_Market|Shepherd_Market| ,  |Mayfair|Mayfair| , London, renting from  |Harry_Nilsson|Harry_Nilsson| .  |Cass_Elliot|Cass_Elliot|  had died there four years earlier, at the age of 32;   Nilsson was concerned about letting the flat to Moon, believing it was cursed. Townshend disagreed, assuring him that lightning wouldnt strike the same place twice .     After moving in, Moon began a prescribed course of Heminevrin  to alleviate his  |alcohol_withdrawal|Alcohol_Withdrawal|  symptoms. He wanted to get sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals he wanted to do it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised  |detoxification|Alcohol_Detoxification|  because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce  |tolerance|Drug_Tolerance| , and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol.  The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moons lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.     By September 1978 Moon was having difficulty playing the drums, according to roadie Dave Cy Langston. After seeing Moon in the studio trying to overdub drums for The Kids Are Alright, he said, After two or three hours, he got more and more sluggish, he could barely hold a drum stick.           On 6 September, Moon and Walter-Lax were guests of  |Paul|Paul_Mccartney|  and  |Linda_McCartney|Linda_Mccartney|  at a preview of a film,  The Buddy Holly Story . After dining with the McCartneys at Peppermint Park in  |Covent_Garden|Covent_Garden| , Moon and Walter-Lax returned to their flat. He watched a film , and asked Walter-Lax to cook him steak and eggs. When she objected, Moon replied, If you dont like it, you can fuck off! These were his  |last_words|Last_Words| . Moon then took 32 clomethiazole tablets. When Walter-Lax checked on him the following afternoon, she discovered he was dead.     Curbishley phoned the flat at around 5  pm looking for Moon, and Dymond gave him the news. Curbishley told Townshend, who informed the rest of the band. Entwistle was giving an interview to French journalists when he was interrupted by a phone call with the news of Moons death. Trying to tactfully and quickly end the interview, he broke down and wept when the journalist asked him about the Whos future plans.     Moons death came shortly after the release of  Who Are You . On the album cover, he is straddling a chair to hide his weight gain; the words Not to be taken away are on the back of the chair.     Police determined that there were 32 clomethiazole pills in Moons system. Six were digested, sufficient to cause his death; the other 26 were undigested when he died. Max Glatt, an authority on alcoholism, wrote in The Sunday Times that Moon should never have been given the drug.  Moon was cremated on 13 September 1978 at  |Golders_Green_Crematorium|Golders_Green_Crematorium|  in London, and his ashes were scattered in its Gardens of Remembrance.     Townshend convinced Daltrey and Entwistle to carry on touring as The Who, although he later said that it was his means of coping with Moons death and completely irrational, bordering on insane .  |AllMusics|Allmusic|  Bruce Eder said, When Keith Moon died, the Who carried on and were far more competent and reliable musically, but that wasnt what sold rock records.  In November 1978,  |Faces|Faces|  drummer  |Kenney_Jones|Kenney_Jones|  joined the Who. Townshend later said that Jones was one of the few British drummers who could fill Keiths shoes ; Daltrey was less enthusiastic, saying that Jones wasnt the right style . Keyboardist  |John_Rabbit_Bundrick|John_Bundrick| , who had rehearsed with Moon earlier in the year, joined the live band as an unofficial member.     Jones left the Who in 1988,  and drummer  |Simon_Phillips|Simon_Phillips|   toured with the band the following year. Since 1996, the Whos drummer has been Ringo Starrs son  |Zak_Starkey|Zak_Starkey| , who had been given a drum kit by Moon .   Starkey had previously toured in 1994 with Roger Daltrey.      The  |London_2012_Summer_Olympic_Committee|2012_Summer_Olympics|  contacted Curbishley about Moon performing at the games, 34 years after his death. In an interview with  The Times  Curbishley quipped, I emailed back saying Keith now resides in Golders Green Crematorium, having lived up to the Whos anthemic line I hope I die before I get old  ... If they have a round table, some glasses and candles, we might contact him.             Moons drumming has been praised by critics. Author Nick Talevski described him as the greatest drummer in rock, adding that he was to the drums what  |Jimi_Hendrix|Jimi_Hendrix|  was to the guitar.  Holly George-Warren, editor and author of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: The First 25 Years, said: With the death of Keith Moon in 1978, rock arguably lost its single greatest drummer.  According to Eder, Moon, with his manic, lunatic side, and his life of excessive drinking, partying, and other indulgences, probably represented the youthful, zany side of rock & roll, as well as its self-destructive side, better than anyone else on the planet.  The New Book of Rock Lists ranked Moon No.  1 on its list of 50 Greatest Rock n Roll Drummers,   and he was ranked No.  2 on the 2011 Rolling Stone Best Drummers of All Time readers poll. In 2016, the same magazine ranked him No. 2 in their list of the 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time, behind  |John_Bonham|John_Bonham| .  Adam Budofsky, editor of Drummer magazine, said that Moons performances on Whos Next and Quadrophenia represent a perfect balance of technique and passion and theres been no drummer whos touched his unique slant on rock and rhythm since.      Several rock drummers, including  |Neil_Peart|Neil_Peart|  Anatomy of a Drum Solo DVD, Neil Peart accompanying booklet. and  |Dave_Grohl|Dave_Grohl| , have cited Moon as an influence.   |The_Jam|The_Jam|  paid homage to Moon on the second single from their third album,  |Down_in_the_Tube_Station_at_Midnight|Down_In_The_Tube_Station_At_Midnight|  ; the B-side of the single is a Who  |cover|Cover_Song|  , and the back cover of the record has a photo of Moons face. The Jams single was released about a month after Moons death.  |Animal|Animal| , one of  |Jim_Hensons|Jim_Henson| |Muppet|The_Muppets|  characters, may have been based on Keith Moon due to their similar hair, eyebrows, personality and drumming style.   Jazz drummer  |Elvin_Jones|Elvin_Jones|  praised Moons work during  |Underture|Tommy|  , as integral to the songs effect.       |Ray_Davies|Ray_Davies|  notably lauded Moons drumming during his speech for the Kinks induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1990: ...Keith Moon changed the sound of drumming.      God bless his beautiful heart  ...  |Ozzy_Osbourne|Ozzy_Osbourne|  told  Sounds  a month after the drummers death. People will be talking about Keith Moon til they die, man. Someone somewhere will say, Remember Keith Moon? Who will remember  |Joe_Bloggs|Joe_Bloggs|  who got killed in a car crash? No one. Hes dead, so what? He didnt do anything to talk of.       |Clem_Burke|Clem_Burke|  of  |Blondie|Blondie|  has said Early on all I cared about was Keith Moon and the Who. When I was about eleven or twelve, my favourite part of drum lessons was the last ten minutes, when Id get to sit at the drumset and play along to my favourite record. Id bring in My Generation. At the end of the song, the drums go nuts. My Generation was a turning point for me because before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing.      In 1998 Tony Fletcher published a biography of Moon, Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon, in the United Kingdom. The phrase Dear Boy became a  |catchphrase|Catchphrase|  of Moons when, influenced by Kit Lambert, he began affecting a pompous English accent. In 2000, the book was released in the US as Moon .  Q Magazine  called the book horrific and terrific reading , and  Record Collector  said it was one of rocks great biographies.      In 2008,  |English_Heritage|English_Heritage|  declined an application for Moon to be awarded a  |blue_plaque|Blue_Plaque| . Speaking to  The Guardian ,  |Christopher_Frayling|Christopher_Frayling|  said they decided that bad behaviour and overdosing on various substances wasnt a sufficient qualification. The UKs Heritage Foundation disagreed with the decision, presenting a plaque which was unveiled on 9 March 2009. Daltrey, Townshend,  |Robin_Gibb|Robin_Gibb|  and Moons mother Kit were present at the ceremony.           ;Solo albums    Two Sides of the Moon  .
