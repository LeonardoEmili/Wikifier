        An emulsion is a  |mixture|Mixture|  of two or more  |liquids|Liquid|  that are normally  |immiscible|Immiscible|  . Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of  |matter|Matter|  called  |colloids|Colloid| . Although the terms colloid and emulsion are sometimes used interchangeably, emulsion should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid  is  |dispersed|Dispersion|  in the other . Examples of emulsions include  |vinaigrettes|Vinaigrette| , homogenized  |milk|Milk| , and some  |cutting_fluids|Cutting_Fluid|  for  |metal_working|Metal_Working| .     The word emulsion comes from the Latin emulgere to milk out, from ex out + mulgere to milk , as milk is an emulsion of fat and water, along with other components.      Two liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water can form, first, an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the oil is the dispersed phase, and water is the continuous phase.  Second, they can form a water-in-oil emulsion, wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase. Multiple emulsions are also possible, including a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion and an oil-in-water-in-oil emulsion.      Emulsions, being liquids, do not exhibit a static internal structure. The droplets dispersed in the continuous phase are usually assumed to be  |statistically_distributed|Probability_Distribution| .     The term emulsion is also used to refer to the photo-sensitive side of  |photographic_film|Photographic_Film| . Such a  |photographic_emulsion|Photographic_Emulsion|  consists of  |silver_halide|Silver_Halide|  colloidal particles dispersed in a  |gelatin|Gelatin|  matrix.  |Nuclear_emulsions|Nuclear_Emulsion|  are similar to photographic emulsions, except that they are used in particle physics to detect high-energy  |elementary_particles|Elementary_Particle| .            Emulsions contain both a dispersed and a continuous phase, with the boundary between the phases called the interface  . Emulsions tend to have a cloudy appearance because the many  |phase_interfaces|Phase_Boundary| |scatter|Scattering|  light as it passes through the emulsion. Emulsions appear  |white|White|  when all light is scattered equally. If the emulsion is dilute enough, higher-frequency light will be scattered more, and the emulsion will appear  |blue|Blue| r  – this is called the  |Tyndall_effect|Tyndall_Effect|  . If the emulsion is concentrated enough, the color will be distorted toward comparatively longer wavelengths, and will appear more  |yellow|Yellow| . This phenomenon is easily observable when comparing  |skimmed_milk|Skimmed_Milk| , which contains little fat, to  |cream|Cream| , which contains a much higher concentration of milk fat. One example would be a mixture of water and oil.     Two special classes of emulsions  –  |microemulsions|Microemulsion|  and nanoemulsions, with droplet sizes below 100  nm  – appear translucent.  This property is due to the fact that light waves are scattered by the droplets only if their sizes exceed about one-quarter of the wavelength of the incident light. Since the  |visible_spectrum|Visible_Spectrum|  of light is composed of wavelengths between 390 and 750  |nanometers|Nanometer|  , if the droplet sizes in the emulsion are below about 100  nm, the light can penetrate through the emulsion without being scattered.  Due to their similarity in appearance, translucent nanoemulsions and  |microemulsions|Microemulsions|  are frequently confused. Unlike translucent nanoemulsions, which require specialized equipment to be produced, microemulsions are spontaneously formed by “solubilizing” oil molecules with a mixture of  |surfactants|Surfactant| , co-surfactants, and co- |solvents|Solvent| . The required surfactant concentration in a  |microemulsion|Microemulsion|  is, however, several times higher than that in a translucent nanoemulsion, and significantly exceeds the concentration of the dispersed phase. Because of many undesirable side-effects caused by surfactants, their presence is disadvantageous or prohibitive in many applications. In addition, the stability of a microemulsion is often easily compromised by dilution, by heating, or by changing pH levels.     Common emulsions are inherently unstable and, thus, do not tend to form spontaneously. Energy input  – through shaking, stirring,  |homogenizing|Homogenization| , or exposure to power  |ultrasound|Ultrasound|    – is needed to form an emulsion. Over time, emulsions tend to revert to the stable state of the phases comprising the emulsion. An example of this is seen in the separation of the oil and vinegar components of  |vinaigrette|Vinaigrette| , an unstable emulsion that will quickly separate unless shaken almost continuously. There are important exceptions to this rule  –  |microemulsions|Microemulsions|  are  |thermodynamically|Thermodynamics|  stable, while translucent nanoemulsions are  |kinetically|Kinetics|  stable.     Whether an emulsion of oil and water turns into a water-in-oil emulsion or an oil-in-water emulsion depends on the volume fraction of both phases and the type of emulsifier  present. In general, the  |Bancroft_rule|Bancroft_Rule|  applies. Emulsifiers and emulsifying particles tend to promote dispersion of the phase in which they do not dissolve very well. For example, proteins dissolve better in water than in oil, and so tend to form oil-in-water emulsions .     The geometric structure of an emulsion mixture of two lyophobic liquids with a large concentration of the secondary component is fractal: Emulsion particles unavoidably form dynamic inhomogeneous structures on small length scale. The geometry of these structures is fractal. The size of elementary irregularities is governed by a universal function which depends on the volume content of the components. The fractal dimension of these irregularities is 2.5.        Emulsion stability refers to the ability of an emulsion to resist change in its properties over time.   There are four types of instability in emulsions:  |flocculation|Flocculation| ,  |creaming|Creaming| / |sedimentation|Sedimentation| ,  |coalescence|Coalescence| , and  |Ostwald_ripening|Ostwald_Ripening| . Flocculation occurs when there is an attractive force between the droplets, so they form flocs, like bunches of grapes. This process can be desired, if controlled in its extent, to tune physical properties of emulsions such as their flow behaviour.  Coalescence occurs when droplets bump into each other and combine to form a larger droplet, so the average droplet size increases over time. Emulsions can also undergo  |creaming|Creaming| , where the droplets rise to the top of the emulsion under the influence of  |buoyancy|Buoyancy| , or under the influence of the  |centripetal_force|Centripetal_Force|  induced when a  |centrifuge|Centrifuge|  is used. Creaming is a common phenomenon in dairy and non-dairy beverages and usually does not change the droplet size.  Sedimentation is the opposite phenomenon of creaming and normally observed in water-in-oil emulsions . Sedimentation happens when the dispersed phase is denser than the continuous phase and the gravitational forces pull the denser globules towards the bottom of the emulsion. Similar to creaming, sedimentation follows Stoke’s law.     An appropriate surface active agent  can increase the kinetic stability of an emulsion so that the size of the droplets does not change significantly with time. The stability of an emulsion, like a  |suspension|Suspension| , can be studied in terms of  |zeta_potential|Zeta_Potential| , which indicates the repulsion between droplets or particles. If the size and dispersion of droplets does not change over time, it is said to be stable.  For example, oil-in-water emulsions containing  |mono-_and_diglycerides|Mono-_And_Diglycerides_Of_Fatty_Acids|  and milk protein as  |surfactant|Surfactant|  showed that stable oil droplet size over 28 days storage at 25°C.       The stability of emulsions can be characterized using techniques such as light scattering, focused beam reflectance measurement, centrifugation, and  |rheology|Rheology| . Each method has advantages and disadvantages.        The kinetic process of destabilization can be rather long  – up to several months, or even years for some products.  Often the formulator must accelerate this process in order to test products in a reasonable time during product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used – these consist of increasing the emulsion temperature to accelerate destabilization .  Temperature affects not only the viscosity but also the interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or, on a broader scope, interactions between droplets within the system. Storing an emulsion at high temperatures enables the simulation of realistic conditions for a product , but also accelerates destabilization processes up to 200 times.     Mechanical methods of acceleration, including vibration, centrifugation, and agitation, can also be used.     These methods are almost always empirical, without a sound scientific basis.       An emulsifier is a substance that stabilizes an emulsion by increasing its  |kinetic_stability|Chemical_Kinetics| . One class of emulsifiers is known as surface active agents , or  |surfactants|Surfactant| . Emulsifiers are compounds that typically have a polar or hydrophilic part and a non-polar part. Because of this, emulsifiers tend to have more or less solubility either in water or in oil. Emulsifiers that are more soluble in water will generally form oil-in-water emulsions, while emulsifiers that are more soluble in oil will form water-in-oil emulsions. Cassiday, L. . Emulsions: Making oil and water mix. Retrieved from      Examples of food emulsifiers are:    |Egg_yolk|Egg_Yolk|   – in which the main emulsifying agent is  |lecithin|Lecithin| . In fact, lecithos is the Greek word for egg yolk.    |Mustard|Mustard_Seed|   – where a variety of chemicals in the  |mucilage|Mucilage|  surrounding the seed hull act as emulsifiers    |Soy_lecithin|Soy_Lecithin|  is another emulsifier and thickener    |Pickering_stabilization|Pickering_Emulsion|   – uses particles under certain circumstances    |Sodium_phosphates|Sodium_Phosphates| |Mono-_and_diglycerides|Mono-_And_Diglycerides_Of_Fatty_Acids|  - a common emulsifier found in many food products    |Sodium_stearoyl_lactylate|Sodium_Stearoyl_Lactylate| |DATEM|Datem|   – an emulsifier used primarily in baking   Simple cellulose – a  |particulate_emulsifier|Pickering_Emulsion|  derived from plant material using only water      |Detergents|Detergent|  are another class of surfactant, and will interact physically with both  |oil|Cooking_Oil|  and  |water|Water| , thus stabilizing the interface between the oil and water droplets in suspension. This principle is exploited in  |soap|Soap| , to remove  |grease|Yellow_Grease|  for the purpose of  |cleaning|Cleaning_Agent| . Many different emulsifiers are used in  |pharmacy|Pharmacy|  to prepare emulsions such as  |creams|Cream|  and  |lotions|Lotion| . Common examples include  |emulsifying_wax|Emulsifying_Wax| ,  |polysorbate_20|Polysorbate_20| , and  |ceteareth_20|Ceteareth| .      Sometimes the inner phase itself can act as an emulsifier, and the result is a nanoemulsion, where the inner state disperses into  |nano-|Nano-| size droplets within the outer phase. A well-known example of this phenomenon, the  |ouzo_effect|Ouzo_Effect|  , happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic  |anise|Anise| -based beverage, such as  |ouzo|Ouzo| ,  |pastis|Pastis| ,  |absinthe|Absinthe| ,  |arak|Arak| , or  |raki|Rakı| . The anisolic compounds, which are soluble in  |ethanol|Ethanol| , then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water. The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.       A number of different chemical and physical processes and mechanisms can be involved in the process of emulsification:  |acacia|Gum_Arabic|  and  |tragacanth|Tragacanth| , which are hydrocolloids, as well as PEG , glycerine, and other polymers like CMC , all increase the viscosity of the medium, which helps create and maintain the suspension of globules of dispersed phase           Oil-in-water emulsions are common in food products:   Crema in  |espresso|Espresso|  – coffee oil in water , unstable emulsion    |Mayonnaise|Mayonnaise|  and  |Hollandaise_sauces|Hollandaise_Sauce|  – these are oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with egg yolk  |lecithin|Lecithin| , or with other types of food additives, such as  |sodium_stearoyl_lactylate|Sodium_Stearoyl_Lactylate| |Homogenized_milk|Homogenized_Milk|  – an emulsion of milk fat in water, with milk proteins as the emulsifier    |Vinaigrette|Vinaigrette|  – an emulsion of vegetable oil in vinegar, if this is prepared using only oil and vinegar , an unstable emulsion results     Water-in-oil emulsions are less common in food, but still exist:    |Butter|Butter|  – an emulsion of water in butterfat    |Margarine|Margarine|      Other foods can be turned into products similar to emulsions, for example  |meat_emulsion|Meat_Emulsion|  is a suspension of meat in liquid that is similar to true emulsions.       In  |pharmaceutics|Pharmaceutics| ,  |hairstyling|Hairstyling_Product| ,  |personal_hygiene|Personal_Hygiene| , and  |cosmetics|Cosmetics| , emulsions are frequently used. These are usually oil and water emulsions but dispersed, and which is continuous depends in many cases on the  |pharmaceutical_formulation|Pharmaceutical_Formulation| . These emulsions may be called  |creams|Cream| ,  |ointments|Ointment| ,  |liniments|Liniment|  ,  |pastes|Paste| ,  |films|Thin_Film| , or  |liquids|Liquid| , depending mostly on their oil-to-water ratios, other additives, and their intended  |route_of_administration|Route_Of_Administration| .   The first 5 are  |topical|Topical| |dosage_forms|Dosage_Form| , and may be used on the surface of the  |skin|Human_Skin| ,  |transdermal|Transdermal| ly,  |ophthalmically|Eye_Drop| ,  |rectal|Rectal| ly, or  |vagina|Vagina| lly. A highly liquid emulsion may also be used  |oral|Oral_Administration| ly, or may be  |injected|Injection|  in some cases.     Microemulsions are used to deliver  |vaccines|Vaccine|  and kill  |microbes|Microbe| .  Typical emulsions used in these techniques are nanoemulsions of  |soybean_oil|Soybean_Oil| , with particles that are 400–600  nm in diameter.  The process is not chemical, as with other types of  |antimicrobial|Antimicrobial|  treatments, but mechanical. The smaller the droplet the greater the  |surface_tension|Surface_Tension|  and thus the greater the force required to merge with other  |lipids|Lipids| . The oil is emulsified with detergents using a  |high-shear_mixer|High-Shear_Mixer|  to stabilize the emulsion so, when they encounter the lipids in the  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane|  or envelope of  |bacteria|Cell_Envelope|  or  |virus|Virus| es, they force the lipids to merge with themselves. On a mass scale, in effect this disintegrates the membrane and kills the pathogen. The soybean oil emulsion does not harm normal human cells, or the cells of most other  |higher_organisms|Higher_Organisms| , with the exceptions of  |sperm_cells|Spermatozoon|  and  |blood_cells|Blood_Cells| , which are vulnerable to nanoemulsions due to the peculiarities of their membrane structures. For this reason, these nanoemulsions are not currently used  |intravenous|Intravenous| ly . The most effective application of this type of nanoemulsion is for the  |disinfection|Disinfection|  of surfaces. Some types of nanoemulsions have been shown to effectively destroy  |HIV-1|Hiv-1|  and  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis|  pathogens on non- |porous|Porous|  surfaces.       Emulsifying agents are effective at extinguishing fires on small, thin-layer spills of flammable liquids . Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors in the water phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an  |aqueous|Aqueous_Solution|  surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment is a function of the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as  |aqueous_film-forming_foam|Fire-Fighting_Foam|  need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.           Emulsions are used to manufacture polymer dispersions – polymer production in an emulsion phase has a number of process advantages, including prevention of coagulation of product. Products produced by such polymerisations may be used as the emulsions – products including primary components for glues and paints. Synthetic  |latex|Latex|.
