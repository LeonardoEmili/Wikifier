         Until 22 May 2014 the politics of Thailand were conducted within the framework of a  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy| , whereby the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Thailand|  is the  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government|  and a  |hereditary_monarch|Hereditary_Monarchy|  is  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| . The  |judiciary|Judiciary|  is independent of the executive and the legislative branches.     Since  |the_coup_détat_of_22_May_2014|2014_Thai_Coup_Détat| , the 2007 constitution was revoked, and Thailand has been under the rule of a military organization called  |National_Council_for_Peace_and_Order|National_Council_For_Peace_And_Order|  , which has taken control of the national administration. The chief of the NCPO abolished the national assembly and assumed the responsibilities of the legislative branch. Under the  |martial_law|Martial_Law|  enforced throughout the kingdom, military courts have been tasked to be responsible for some cases that are normally under the civilian courts. However, the court system, including the  |Constitutional_Court|Constitutional_Court_Of_Thailand| , still remains in existence, even without the constitution.      |Thai|Thailand|  kingdoms and the late Kingdom of Siam were under absolute rule of kings. After the  |democratic_revolution|Siamese_Revolution_Of_1932|  in 1932, led by Westernized bureaucrats and a tradition-oriented military, the country officially became a  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy|  with a prime minister as the head of government. The first written constitution was issued. Politics became the arena of fighting factions between old and new elites, bureaucrats, and generals. Coups happened from time to time, often bringing the country under the rule of yet another  |junta|Military_Junta| . To date Thailand has had 17 charters and constitutions, reflecting a high degree of political instability. After successful coups, military regimes have abrogated existing constitutions and promulgated interim charters. Negotiations between politicians, bureaucrats, influence peddlers, Corporate Leaders and Army Officers have become a driving force in the restoration of temporary political stability.               Before the 1932 revolution, the kingdom had no written constitution. The monarch was the originator of all laws and the head of the government.  In 1932 the first written  |constitution|Constitution_Of_Thailand1932_Constitution|  was issued, expected to be the most important guideline of the kingdom. Constitutions have traditionally been considered to be the symbol of democracy in Thailand, despite their many abrogations and changes. However, when political disputes took place among the elites, the first military coup occurred in 1933 and the first official constitution was removed, to be replaced by a new one.     All of Thailands charters and constitutions have recognized a unified kingdom with a constitutional monarchy, but with widely differing balances of power between the branches of government. Most Thai governments have stipulated parliamentary systems. Several, however, also called for dictatorships, e.g.,  |the_1959_constitution|Constitution_Of_Thailand1959_Charter| . Both unicameral and bicameral parliaments have been used, and members of parliament have been both elected and appointed. The direct powers of the monarch have also varied considerably.     Thailands popular constitution , called the peoples constitution was successfully promulgated in 1997 after the 1992  |Bloody_May|Black_May|  incident. Publicly, constitutional devices have often charged as the root of political turmoil. The  |1997_constitution|Constitution_Of_Thailand1997_Constitution|  was considered a landmark for the degree of public participation involved in its drafting, as well as the democratic nature of its articles. It prescribed a bicameral legislature, both houses of which are elected. Many civil rights were explicitly acknowledged, and measures were established to increase the stability of elected governments. New organs supervising administrative power such as the  |Constitutional_Court|Constitutional_Court_Of_Thailand| , the  |Administrative_Court|Administrative_Court| , and the  |Ombudsman|Ombudsman|  also emerged for the first time. These organs later became a threat to politicians, particularly when  |Thaksin_Shinawatra|Thaksin_Shinawatra| , one of the most popular politicians in Thai history, when his financial dealings became an issue.     Following an army-led coup on 19 September 2006, the 1997 constitution was abrogated. The junta ruled the country by martial law and executive decree for weeks, until it published an interim constitution on 1 October 2006. The interim constitution allowed the junta to appoint a prime minister, a legislature, and a committee to draft a permanent constitution. Local and municipal elections were held as usual. In 2007 the new constitution was eventually issued, said to be a junta supported constitution by many critics. The 2007 constitution was again abolished in another military takeover on 22 May 2014. According to the 2017 constitution, Thailands entire political system is under the control of the army, through the appointed Senate but also via an array of military-dominated oversight bodies      The  |King_of_Thailand|King_Of_Thailand|  has little direct power under the  |constitution|Constitution_Of_Thailand| , but is a symbol of national identity and unity.  |King_Bhumibol|Bhumibol_Adulyadej| —on the throne from 1946-2016—commanded enormous popular respect and  |moral_authority|Moral_Authority| , which he used on occasion to resolve political crises that threatened national stability.            Thailand was a kingdom under an absolute monarch for over seven centuries before 1932.     As a result of imperialism, the kings began minor reforms. The king was the president of the government, consulted with his councillors, mainly his relatives. Though significant reforms had occurred in  |Rama_Vs|Rama_V|  reign, the kingdom still had no national assembly. Men of royal blood held positions in the government as ministers. The situation became tense after the World War I. An economic crisis bedeviled the country. A young generation of students and intellectuals studying in Europe began criticizing the crowns government as backward, corrupt, and ineffective. On 24 June 1932, troops in  |Bangkok|Bangkok|  seized government buildings and some key ministers. The  |1932_revolution|Siamese_Revolution_Of_1932|  took place. Its leaders were both bureaucrats and young military officers, urging national reforms, including the first written constitution. After negotiation with the king,  |Rama_VII|Rama_Vii| , and the kingdoms elite, changes took place, ending absolute rule by the king. The king remained the titular head of state, but the constitutional government ruled the country with the prime minister at its head. A general election was held for the creation of the first national assembly. The election was the first in which women were permitted to vote.     Despite the efforts of many democrats in the past including  |Pridi_Banomyong|Pridi_Banomyong| , Western, democratic-style of government was alien to the kingdom. It was claimed that Siam had insufficient time to educate its population in preparation for Western political, industrial, and economic changes.     Since becoming a Western-style constitutional democratic monarchy in 1932, most of the time the country has been ruled by military governments. The disputes and struggles among the elites old and new, civilians, politicians, and military have occurred regularly since 1932. The first military coup staged by the 1932 revolutionary, military wing itself, occurred in 1933. The military became a tool for political stability. Political freedom, freedom of speech, and basic human rights were strongly compromised in the first three-quarters of the 20th century.     Due to the pressure of outside events during the Vietnam War, the politics of the kingdom became even more tense. The military government, with the support of the US, tightened its control over the countrys politics, while intellectuals and leftist students strongly opposed the junta.     The  |Communist_Party_of_Thailand|Communist_Party_Of_Thailand|  staged armed struggle in the countryside in the 1960s. Communist and radical ideas attracted a handful of intellectuals. The communist movement was seen as congruent with the independence movements in other  |Indochinese|Indochinese|  countries, waging war against the US. In response, the military junta tightened its grip.     Student-led uprisings in October 1973 led to a new vision of liberating the country from military government for a short period. The media received more freedom to criticize politicians and governments, while revolutionary and socialist movements became more apparent. The new civilian government officially shut US bases amid the fear of communist victory in the Indochinese countries in 1975. In 1976, Admiral  |Sa_ngad_Chaloryu|Sa_Ngad_Chaloryu| , the armed forces commander, staged a  |massacre_and_coup|6_October_1976_Massacre|  that brought hard-line anti-communists to power and reversed these reforms.     At the end of the  |Indochina_War|First_Indochina_War| , investment by foreign businesses helped alleviate poor infrastructure and social problems. The middle classes constituted only 10 per cent of the 60 million inhabitants. They enjoyed wealth and increasing freedom, leaving the majority poor in the rural areas and slums.     The system of rule fluctuated between unstable civilian governments and interludes of military takeover. During democratic periods, the middle class in the cities ignored the poor in the rural areas. The media accepted bribes. To corrupt bureaucrats and politicians became well-accepted business practice.     Every time a coup was staged, scapegoats or excuses were found to justify it. Eventually, the ensuing junta government would hand the government back to elected officials. As a result, there have been 18 coups and 18 constitutions in the history of Thai politics.     From 1932, bureaucrats, generals, and businessmen have run most of the political parties. While the  |grassroots|Grassroots|  are always the target of the political parties, no grassroots party has ever led the country. Money seems to be the major factor in gaining power in the country.     The  |Black_May|Black_May|  uprising, in 1992, lead to more reform when promulgating the  |1997_constitution|1997_Constitution_Of_Thailand|  aiming to create checks and balance of powers between strengthened government, separately elected senators, and anti-corruption agencies. Administrative courts, constitutional courts, and election-control committees were established to strengthen the checks and balance of politics.     The  |2007_constitution|2007_Constitution_Of_Thailand| , following  |Thaksins|Thaksin_Shinawatra|  ousting, was particularly designed to be tighter in its control of corruptions and conflicts of interests while reducing the authority of the government. It was repealed in the 22 May 2014 coup détat.                According to the now defunct 2007 constitution, the three major independent authorities holding the balance of power are executive, legislative, and judicial.     Although the  |King|List_Of_Kings_Of_Thailand|  has little direct power under the  |constitution|Constitution|  and Thailand categorizes itself as a constitutional monarchy, the king is more than a symbol of national identity and unity. The present monarch has a great deal of popular respect and  |moral_authority|Moral_Authority| , which has been used to intervene in political crises and influence the course of the government.     The  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government|  is the  |prime_minister|List_Of_Prime_Ministers_Of_Thailand| . Under the now defunct 2007 constitution, the prime minister must be a  |member_of_parliament|Member_Of_Parliament| . Cabinet members do not have to be  |members_of_parliament|Members_Of_Parliament| . The legislature can hold a vote of no-confidence against the premier and members of his cabinet if it has sufficient votes.     Currently, Thailand is under the rule of the  |National_Council_for_Peace_and_Order|National_Council_For_Peace_And_Order|  since the military coup on 22 May 2014.          A long history of corruption exists in Thailand, with extortion, bribery and the use of insider information to buy land among the types regularly observed. Corruption is deeply embedded in Thai society for numerous reasons, including the tradition that officials were entitled to 10 to 30 per cent of expenditures for rendering their services, rather than a salary; a tradition of giving gifts to high officials also persists, and while these practices are not directly corrupting, the continuation of gift-giving during a period when officials receive salaries is a major basis of corruption. Corruption has also been identified in the Thai energy sector. In addition to the misallocation of finances, large bribes are received by the officials who are responsible for choosing contractors for jobs.     In the 2013 Global Corruption Barometer study, conducted by Transparency International, 71 per cent of Thai respondents perceived the police to be corrupt/extremely corrupt, 68 per cent expressed a feeling that political parties were corrupt/extremely corrupt and 45 per cent identified corruption in the parliament/legislature. Additionally, 37 per cent reported paying a bribe to police, while this figure is 14 per cent in regard to the judiciary.              Thailand is an active participant in international and regional organizations, and maintains a particularly close and longstanding security relationship with the United States.  |Thailands|Thailand|  foreign policy includes support for  |ASEAN|Asean|  and it has developed increasingly close ties with the organisations other members, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, and Vietnam. Thailand also attends the annual meetings held by the foreign and economic ministers of the ASEAN nations, including the inaugural  |East_Asia_Summit|East_Asia_Summit|  that was held in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005.      Regional cooperation is progressing for Thailand in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters. In 2003, Thailand served as an APEC host and formulated the meetings theme: A World of Differences: Partnership for the Future .   |Supachai_Panitchpakdi|Supachai_Panitchpakdi| , the former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, served as Director-General of the  |World_Trade_Organization|World_Trade_Organization|  between 2002 and 2005.
