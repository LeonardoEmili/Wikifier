           In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a partial function from X to Y  is a  |function|Function|  , for some  |subset|Subset|  X of  X. It generalizes the concept of a function  by not forcing f to map every element of X to an element of Y . If , then f is called a total function for emphasizing that its domain is not a proper subset of X. Partial functions are often used when the exact  |domain|Domain_Of_A_Function| , X, is not known . In  |real|Real_Analysis|  and  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis| , a partial function is generally called simply a function.     Specifically, we will say that for any , either:     or   f is undefined.   A partial function is a  |univalent_relation|Univalent_Relation| , a particular type of  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation|  from X to Y.     For example, we can consider the  |square_root|Square_Root|  function restricted to the  |integers|Integer|    : g          : g       Thus g is only defined for n that are  |perfect_squares|Square_Number|  . So, , but g is undefined.       There are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the  |domain|Domain_Of_A_Function|  of a partial function. Most mathematicians, including  |recursion_theorists|Recursion_Theory| , use the term domain of f for the set of all values x such that f is defined . But some, particularly  |category_theorists|Category_Theory| , consider the domain of a partial function fX  →  Y to be X, and refer to X  as the domain of definition. Similarly, the term  |range|Range|  can refer to either the  |codomain|Codomain|  or the image of a function.     A partial function is said to be  |injective|Injective|  or  |surjective|Surjective|  when the total function given by the restriction of the partial function to its domain of definition is injective or surjective respectively. A partial function may be both injective and surjective .     Because a function is trivially surjective when restricted to its image, the term  |partial_bijection|Partial_Bijection|  denotes a partial function which is injective.      An injective partial function may be inverted to an injective partial function, and a partial function which is both injective and surjective has an injective function as inverse. Furthermore, a total function which is injective may be inverted to an injective partial function.     The notion of  |transformation|Transformation|  can be generalized to partial functions as well. A partial transformation is a function , where both A and B are  |subsets|Subset|  of some set X.       Total function is a  |synonym|Synonym|  for  |function|Function| . The use of the adjective total is to suggest that it is a special case of a partial function . The adjective will typically be used for clarity in contexts where partial functions are common, for example in  |computability_theory|Computability_Theory| .       The set of all partial functions  from a set X to a set Y, denoted by , is the union of all total functions defined on subsets of X with same codomain Yc not contained in Y, so that the codomain is , an operation which is injective .       The first diagram at the top of the article represents a partial function that is not a total function since the element 1 in the left-hand set is not associated with anything in the right-hand set. Whereas, the second diagram represents a total function since every element on the left-hand set is associated with exactly one element in the right hand set.       Consider the  |natural_logarithm|Natural_Logarithm|  function mapping the  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real is not a real number, so the natural logarithm function doesnt associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural logarithm function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, but it is a partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the  |positive_reals|Positive_Reals|  , then the natural logarithm is a total function.       Subtraction of  |natural_numbers|Natural_Numbers|   can be viewed as a partial function:     : f:           : f x - y.     It is defined only when x   y .         In  |denotational_semantics|Denotational_Semantics|  a partial function is considered as returning the  |bottom_element|Bottom_Element|  when it is undefined.     In  |computer_science|Computer_Science|  a partial function corresponds to a subroutine that raises an exception or loops forever. The  |IEEE_floating_point|Ieee_Floating_Point|  standard defines a  |not-a-number|Not-A-Number|  value which is returned when a floating point operation is undefined and exceptions are suppressed, e.g. when the square root of a negative number is requested.     In a  |programming_language|Programming_Language|  where function parameters are  |statically_typed|Statically_Typed| , a function may be defined as a partial function because the languages  |type_system|Type_System|  cannot express the exact domain of the function, so the programmer instead gives it the smallest domain which is expressible as a type and contains the true domain.         In  |category_theory|Category_Theory| , when considering the operation of  |morphism|Morphism|  composition in  |concrete_categories|Concrete_Categories| , the composition operation   :           is a total function if and only if   has one element. The reason for this is that two morphisms f:X  Y and g:U  V can only be composed as g   f if YU , that is, the codomain of f must equal the domain of g .     The category of sets and partial functions is  |equivalent|Equivalence_Of_Categories|  to but not  |isomorphic|Isomorphism_Of_Categories|  with the category of  |pointed_sets|Pointed_Set|  and point-preserving maps.  One textbook notes that This formal completion of sets and partial maps by adding “improper,” “infinite” elements was reinvented many times, in particular, in topology  and in  |theoretical_computer_science|Theoretical_Computer_Science| .      The category of sets and partial bijections is equivalent to its  |dual|Opposite_Category| .  It is the prototypical  |inverse_category|Inverse_Category| .         |Partial_algebra|Partial_Algebra|  generalizes the notion of  |universal_algebra|Universal_Algebra|  to partial  |operations|Operation| . An example would be a  |field|Field| , in which the multiplicative inversion is the only proper partial operation .      The set of all partial functions  on a given base set, X, forms a  |regular_semigroup|Regular_Semigroup|  called the semigroup of all partial transformations , typically denoted by   .    The set of all partial bijections on X forms the  |symmetric_inverse_semigroup|Symmetric_Inverse_Semigroup| .       Charts in the  |atlases|Atlas|  which specify the structure of  |manifolds|Manifold|  and  |fiber_bundles|Fiber_Bundle|  are partial functions. In the case of manifolds, the domain is the point set of the manifold. In the case of fiber bundles, the domain is the total space of the fiber bundle. In these applications, the most important construction is the  |transition_map|Atlas_Transition_Maps| .
