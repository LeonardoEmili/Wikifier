      Sir Mackenzie Bowell   was a  |Canadian|Canadians|  newspaper publisher and politician, who served as the fifth  |prime_minister_of_Canada|Prime_Minister_Of_Canada| , in office from 1894 to 1896.     Bowell was born in  |Rickinghall|Rickinghall| ,  |Suffolk,_England|Suffolk,_England| . He and his family moved to  |Belleville,_Ontario|Belleville,_Ontario| , in 1832. His mother died two years after their arrival. When in his early teens, Bowell was apprenticed to the printing shop of the local newspaper, the  Belleville Intelligencer , and some 15 years later, became its owner and proprietor.      |In_1867|1867_Canadian_Federal_Election| , following  |Confederation|Canadian_Confederation| , he was elected to the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_Canada|  for the  |Conservative_Party|Conservative_Party_Of_Canada| . Bowell entered  |cabinet|Cabinet_Of_Canada|  in 1878, and would serve under three prime ministers:  |John_A._Macdonald|John_A._Macdonald| ,  |John_Abbott|John_Abbott| , and  |John_Thompson|John_Sparrow_David_Thompson| . He served variously as  |Minister_of_Customs|Minister_Of_Customs|  ,  |Minister_of_Militia_and_Defence|Minister_Of_Militia_And_Defence|  , and Minister of Trade and Commerce . Bowell kept his Commons seat continuously for 25 years, through a period of Liberal Party rule in the 1870s. In 1892, Bowell was appointed to the  |Senate|Senate_Of_Canada| . He became  |Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate|Leader_Of_The_Government_In_The_Senate|  the following year.     In December 1894, Prime Minister Thompson unexpectedly died in office, aged only 49. The  |Earl_of_Aberdeen|John_Hamilton-Gordon,_1St_Marquess_Of_Aberdeen_And_Temair| , Canadas  |governor_general|Governor_General_Of_Canada| , appointed Bowell to replace Thompson as prime minister, due to his status as the most senior cabinet member. The main problem of Bowells tenure as prime minister was the  |Manitoba_Schools_Question|Manitoba_Schools_Question| . His attempts at compromise alienated members of his own party, and following a Cabinet revolt in early 1896 he was forced to resign in favour of  |Charles_Tupper|Charles_Tupper| . Bowell stayed on as a senator until his death at the age of 93, but never again held ministerial office; he served continuously as a  |Canadian|Canadians|  parliamentarian for 50 years.            Bowell was born in  |Rickinghall|Rickinghall| , England, to John Bowell and Elizabeth Marshall. In 1832 his family emigrated to  |Belleville|Belleville,_Ontario| ,  |Upper_Canada|Upper_Canada| , where he apprenticed with the printer at the town newspaper, The Belleville Intelligencer . He became a successful printer and editor with that newspaper, and later its owner. He was a  |Freemason|Freemason|   at freemasonry.bcy.ca but also an  |Orangeman|Orange_Institution| , becoming Grandmaster of the Orange Order of British North America, 1870–1878.   In 1847 he married Harriet Moore, with whom he had five sons and four daughters.              Bowell was first elected to the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_Canada|  in 1867 as a  |Conservative|Conservative_Party_Of_Canada|  for the riding of North Hastings, Ontario. He held his seat for the Conservatives when they lost the election of January 1874, in the wake of the  |Pacific_Scandal|Pacific_Scandal| . Later that year he was instrumental in having  |Louis_Riel|Louis_Riel|  expelled from the House.       In 1878, with the Conservatives again governing, he joined the Cabinet as Minister of Customs. In 1892 he became Minister of Militia and Defence, having held his Commons seat continuously for 25 years. A competent, hardworking administrator, Bowell remained in Cabinet as Minister of Trade and Commerce, a newly created portfolio, after he became a Senator that same year. His visit to  |Australia|Australia|  in 1893 led to the first leaders conference of  |British_colonies|British_Colonies|  and territories, held in  |Ottawa|Ottawa|  in 1894. He became  |Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate|Leader_Of_The_Government_In_The_Senate|  on October 31, 1893.       In December 1894, Prime Minister Sir  |John_Sparrow_David_Thompson|John_Sparrow_David_Thompson|  died suddenly, and Bowell, as the most senior Cabinet minister, was appointed in Thompsons stead by the Governor General. Bowell thus became the second of just two Canadian Prime Ministers  to hold that office while serving in the Senate rather than the House of Commons.       As Prime Minister, Bowell faced the  |Manitoba_Schools_Question|Manitoba_Schools_Question| . In 1890  |Manitoba|Manitoba|  had abolished public funding for denominational schools, both  |Catholic|Roman_Catholicism|  and  |Protestant|Protestant| , which many thought was contrary to the provisions made for denominational schools in the  |Manitoba_Act|Manitoba_Act|  of 1870. However, in a court challenge, the  |Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council|Judicial_Committee_Of_The_Privy_Council|  held that Manitobas abolition of public funding for denominational schools was consistent with the Manitoba Act provision. City of Winnipeg v. Barrett; City of Winnipeg v. Logan, A.C. 445 . In a second court case, the Judicial Committee held that the federal Parliament had the authority to enact remedial legislation to force Manitoba to re-establish the funding. Brophy v. Attorney General of Manitoba, A.C. 202 .       Bowell and his predecessors struggled to solve this problem, which divided the country, the government, and even Bowells own Cabinet. He was further hampered in his handling of the issue by his own indecisiveness on it and by his inability, as a Senator, to take part in debates in the House of Commons. Bowell backed legislation, already drafted, that would have forced Manitoba to restore its Catholic schools, but then postponed it due to opposition within his Cabinet. With the ordinary business of government at a standstill, Bowells Cabinet decided that he was incompetent to lead and so, to force him to step down, seven ministers resigned and then foiled the appointment of successors.       Though Bowell denounced the rebellious ministers as a nest of traitors, he had to agree to resign. After ten days, following an intervention on Bowells behalf by the Governor General, the government crisis was resolved and matters seemingly returned to normal when six of the ministers were reinstated, but leadership was then effectively held by  |Charles_Tupper|Charles_Tupper| , who had joined Cabinet at the same time, filling the seventh place. Tupper, who had been Canadian  |High_Commissioner|High_Commissioner|  to the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , had been recalled by the plotters to replace Bowell. Bowell formally resigned in favour of Tupper at the end of the parliamentary session.       Bowell stayed in the Senate, serving as his partys leader there until 1906, and afterward as a regular Senator until his death in 1917, having served continuously for more than 50 years as a federal parliamentarian.     He died of  |pneumonia|Pneumonia|  in Belleville, seventeen days short of his 94th birthday. He was buried in the  |Belleville_cemetery|Belleville_Cemetery| .   His funeral was attended by a full complement of the Orange Order, but not by any currently or formerly elected member of the government. The Globe and Mail, Dec. 29, 2017, The accidental prime minister , by Patrick White, p. A17       Bowell was designated a National Historic Person in 1945, on the advice of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board. , Directory of Federal Heritage Designations, no date     The  |Post_Office_Department|Canada_Post|  honored Bowell with a commemorative stamp in 1954, part of a series on prime ministers.     In their 1998 study of the Canadian prime ministers up through  |Jean_Chrétien|Jean_Chrétien| ,  |J._L._Granatstein|Jack_Granatstein|  and  |Norman_Hillmer|Norman_Hillmer|  found that a survey of Canadian historians ranked Bowell 19 out of the 20 Prime Ministers up until then.      Until 2017, Bowell remained the only Canadian prime minister without a full-length biography of his life and career. This shortfall was solved when the Belleville historian  |Betsy_Dewar_Boyces|Betsy_Dewar_Boyce|  book The Accidental Prime Minister was published by  |Bancroft,_Ontario|Bancroft,_Ontario|  publisher Kirby Books. The book was published on the centennial of Bowells death. Boyce had died in 2007, having unsuccessfully sought a publisher for her work for a decade.
