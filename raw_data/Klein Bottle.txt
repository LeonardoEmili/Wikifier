     In  |topology|Topology| , a branch of  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the Klein bottle  is an example of a  |non-orientable|Orientability| |surface|Surface| ; it is a  |two-dimensional|Two-Dimensional| |manifold|Manifold|  against which a system for determining a  |normal_vector|Normal_Vector|  cannot be consistently defined. Informally, it is a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed back to the point of origin while flipping the traveler upside down. Other related non-orientable objects include the  |Möbius_strip|Möbius_Strip|  and the  |real_projective_plane|Real_Projective_Plane| . Whereas a Möbius strip is a surface with  |boundary|Boundary| , a Klein bottle has no boundary .     The Klein bottle was first described in 1882 by the  |German|Germany|  mathematician  |Felix_Klein|Felix_Klein| . It may have been originally named the Kleinsche Fläche and then misinterpreted as Kleinsche Flasche , which ultimately may have led to the adoption of this term in the German language as well.         The following square is a  |fundamental_polygon|Fundamental_Polygon|  of the Klein bottle. The idea is to glue together the corresponding coloured edges with the arrows matching, as in the diagrams below. Note that this is an abstract gluing in the sense that trying to realize this in three dimensions results in a self-intersecting Klein bottle.     : |Image:Klein_Bottle_Folding_1.svg|Image:Klein_Bottle_Folding_1.Svg|      To construct the Klein bottle, glue the red arrows of the square together , resulting in a cylinder. To glue the ends of the cylinder together so that the arrows on the circles match, one would pass one end through the side of the cylinder. This creates a circle of self-intersection – this is an  |immersion|Immersion|  of the Klein bottle in three dimensions.

For example, the Klein bottle has no boundary, where the surface stops abruptly, and it is  |non-orientable|Orientability| , as reflected in the one-sidedness of the immersion.         The common physical model of a Klein bottle is a similar construction. The  |Science_Museum_in_London|Science_Museum|  has a collection of hand-blown glass Klein bottles on display, exhibiting many variations on this topological theme. The bottles date from 1995 and were made for the museum by  |Alan_Bennett|Alan_Bennett| .      The Klein bottle, proper, does not self-intersect. Nonetheless, there is a way to visualize the Klein bottle as being contained in four dimensions. By adding a fourth dimension to the three-dimensional space, the self-intersection can be eliminated. Gently push a piece of the tube containing the intersection along the fourth dimension, out of the original three-dimensional space. A useful analogy is to consider a self-intersecting curve on the plane; self-intersections can be eliminated by lifting one strand off the plane.      Suppose for clarification that we adopt time as that fourth dimension. Consider how the figure could be constructed in xyzt-space. The accompanying illustration shows one useful evolution of the figure. At  the wall sprouts from a bud somewhere near the intersection point. After the figure has grown for a while, the earliest section of the wall begins to recede, disappearing like the  |Cheshire_Cat|Cheshire_Cat|  but leaving its ever-expanding smile behind. By the time the growth front gets to where the bud had been, there’s nothing there to intersect and the growth completes without piercing existing structure. The 4-figure as defined cannot exist in 3-space but is easily understood in 4-space.     More formally, the Klein bottle is the  |quotient_space|Quotient_Space|  described as the  |square|Square|  × with sides identified by the relations  for  and  for .       Like the  |Möbius_strip|Möbius_Strip| , the Klein bottle is a two-dimensional  |manifold|Manifold|  which is not  |orientable|Orientability| . Unlike the Möbius strip, the Klein bottle is a closed manifold, meaning it is a  |compact|Compact_Space|  manifold without boundary. While the Möbius strip can be embedded in three-dimensional  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space|  R 3 , the Klein bottle cannot. It can be embedded in R 4 , however.     The Klein bottle can be seen as a  |fiber_bundle|Fiber_Bundle|  over the  |circle|Circle|  S 1 , with fibre S 1 , as follows: one takes the square from above to be E, the total space, while the base space B is given by the unit interval in y, modulo 1~0. The projection π:E→B is then given by .     The Klein bottle can be constructed by joining the edges of two Möbius strips together, as described in the following  |limerick|Limerick|  by  |Leo_Moser|Leo_Moser|           The initial construction of the Klein bottle by identifying opposite edges of a square shows that the Klein bottle can be given a  |CW_complex|Cw_Complex|  structure with one 0-cell P, two 1-cells C 1 , C 2 and one 2-cell D. Its  |Euler_characteristic|Euler_Characteristic|  is therefore . The boundary homomorphism is given by  and , yielding the  |homology_groups|Cellular_Homology|  of the Klein bottle K to be ,  and  for  sup /sup  ref  /ref  sub /sub  math /math  2π, 0 ≤ v  2.     In this immersion, the self-intersection circle  is a geometric  |circle|Circle|  in the xy plane. The positive constant r is the radius of this circle. The parameter θ gives the angle in the xy plane as well as the rotation of the figure 8, and v specifies the position around the 8-shaped cross section. With the above parametrization the cross section is a 2:1  |Lissajous_curve|Lissajous_Curve| .       A non-intersecting 4-D parametrization can be modeled after that of the  |flat_torus|Flat_Torusflat_Torus| R and P are constants that determine aspect ratio, θ and v are similar to as defined above. v determines the position around the figure-8 as well as the position in the x-y plane. θ determines the rotational angle of the figure-8 as well and the position around the z-w plane. ε is any small constant and ε sinv is a small v depended bump in z-w space to avoid self intersection. The v bump causes the self intersecting 2-D/planar figure-8 to spread out into a 3-D stylized potato chip or saddle shape in the x-y-w and x-y-z space viewed edge on. When ε0 the self intersection is a circle in the z-w plane  .          The pinched torus is perhaps the simplest parametrization of the klein bottle in both three and four dimensions. Its a torus that, in three dimensions, flattens and passes through itself on one side. Unfortunately, in three dimensions this parametrization has two pinch points, which makes it undesirable for some applications. In four dimensions the z amplitude rotates into the w amplitude and there are no self intersections or pinch points.     :     x &       y &       z & r           w & r               One can view this as a tube or cylinder that wraps around, as in a torus, but its circular cross section flips over in four dimensions, presenting its backside as it reconnects, just as a Möbius strip cross section rotates before it reconnects. The 3D orthogonal projection of this is the pinched torus shown above. Just as a Möbius strip is a subset of a solid torus, the Möbius tube is a subset of a toroidally closed  |spherinder|Spherinder|  .       The parametrization of the 3-dimensional immersion of the bottle itself is much more complicated. Here is a version found by Robert Israel:        :     x - &   u       y - &   u       z &             for 0 ≤ u .
