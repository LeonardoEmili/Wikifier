The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the Reisen , 0 being the last digit of the  |imperial_year|Japanese_Calendaryears|  2600 when it entered service with the Imperial Navy. The official  |Allied_reporting_name|World_War_Ii_Allied_Names_For_Japanese_Aircraft|  was Zeke , although the use of the name Zero was used colloquially by the  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  as well.     The Zero is considered to have been the most capable  |carrier-based|Carrier-Based_Aircraft|  fighter in the world when it was introduced early in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , combining excellent maneuverability and very long range. Hawks, Chuck. . chuckhawks.com. Retrieved: 18 January 2007. The  |Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Air_Service|Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Air_Service|  also frequently used it as a land-based fighter.     In early combat operations, the Zero gained a reputation as a  |dogfight|Dogfight| er, Young 2013, p. 36. achieving an outstanding kill ratio of 12 to 1, Thompson with Smith 2008, p. 231. but by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better equipment enabled Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms. Mersky, Peter B. .  ibiblio.org. Retrieved: 18 January 2007. By 1943, due to inherent design weaknesses, such as a lack of hydraulic ailerons and rudder rendering it extremely unmaneuverable at high speeds, and an inability to equip it with a more powerful  |aircraft_engine|Aircraft_Engine| , the Zero gradually became less effective against newer Allied fighters. By 1944, with opposing Allied fighters approaching its levels of maneuverability and consistently exceeding its firepower, armor, and speed, the A6M had largely become outdated as a fighter aircraft. However, as design delays and production difficulties hampered the introduction of newer Japanese aircraft models, the Zero continued to serve in a front-line role until the end of the  |war_in_the_Pacific|Pacific_Ocean_Theater_Of_World_War_Ii| . During the final phases, it was also adapted for use in  kamikaze  operations. Willmott 1980, pp. 40–41. Japan produced more Zeros than any other model of combat aircraft during the war. Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 138.         The  |Mitsubishi_A5M|Mitsubishi_A5M|  fighter was just entering service in early 1937, when the  |Imperial_Japanese_Navy|Imperial_Japanese_Navy|  started looking for its eventual replacement. On October 5, 1937, they issued Planning Requirements for the Prototype 12-shi Carrier-based Fighter , sending it to  |Nakajima|Nakajima_Aircraft_Company|  and  |Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi| . Both firms started preliminary design work while they awaited more definitive requirements to be handed over in a few months.      Based on the experiences of the A5M in China, the IJN sent out updated requirements in October calling for a speed of  at  and a climb to  in 9.5 minutes. With  |drop_tanks|Drop_Tanks| , they wanted an endurance of two hours at normal power, or six to eight hours at economical cruising speed. Armament was to consist of two 20  mm  |cannons|Cannon| , two 7.7  mm  |machine_guns|Machine_Gun|  and two   |bombs|Bomb| . A complete radio set was to be mounted in all aircraft, along with a  |radio_direction_finder|Radio_Direction_Finder|  for long-range navigation. Francillon 1970, pp. 363–364. The maneuverability was to be at least equal to that of the A5M, while the wingspan had to be less than  to allow for use on aircraft carriers.     Nakajimas team considered the new requirements unachievable and pulled out of the competition in January. Mitsubishis chief designer,  |Jiro_Horikoshi|Jiro_Horikoshi| , thought that the requirements could be met, but only if the aircraft were made as light as possible. Every possible weight-saving measure was incorporated into the design. Most of the aircraft was built of a new top-secret aluminium alloy developed by  |Sumitomo_Metal_Industries|Sumitomo_Metal_Industries|  in 1936. Called  |extra_super_duralumin|7075_Aluminium_Alloy|  , it was lighter, stronger and more ductile than other alloys used at the time, but was prone to corrosive attack, which made it brittle. Yoshio, Baba. Journal of Japan Institute of Light Metals , Volume 39, Issue 5, pp. 378–395. Retrieved: 22 November 2015. This detrimental effect was countered with an  |anti-corrosion_coating|Zinc_Chromate|  applied after fabrication. No armour protection was provided for the pilot, engine or other critical points of the aircraft, and  |self-sealing_fuel_tanks|Self-Sealing_Fuel_Tank| , which were becoming common at the time, were not used. This made the Zero lighter, more maneuverable, and the longest-ranged single-engine fighter of World War II, which made it capable of searching out an enemy hundreds of kilometres away, bringing them to battle, then returning to its base or aircraft carrier. However, that tradeoff in weight and construction also made it prone to catching fire and exploding when struck by enemy rounds. Tillman 1979, pp. 5, 6, 96.     With its low-wing  |cantilever|Cantilever| |monoplane|Monoplane|  layout, retractable, wide-set  |conventional_landing_gear|Conventional_Landing_Gear|  and enclosed cockpit, the Zero was one of the most modern carrier based aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction. It had a fairly high-lift, low-speed wing with very low  |wing_loading|Wing_Loading| . This, combined with its light weight, resulted in a very low  |stalling_speed|Stall|  of well below . This was the main reason for its phenomenal maneuverability, allowing it to out-turn any Allied fighter of the time. Early models were fitted with  |servo_tabs|Servo_Tab|  on the  |ailerons|Aileron|  after pilots complained that control forces became too heavy at speeds above . They were discontinued on later models after it was found that the lightened control forces were causing pilots to overstress the wings during vigorous maneuvers. Yoshimura 1996, p. 108.     It has been claimed that the Zeros design showed a clear influence from British and American fighter aircraft and components exported to Japan in the 1930s, and in particular on the American side, the  |Vought_V-143|Vought_V-141|  fighter.  |Chance_Vought|Vought|  had sold the prototype for this aircraft and its plans to Japan in 1937. Eugene Wilson, president of Vought, claimed that when shown a captured Zero in 1943, he found that There on the floor was the Vought V  142  or just the spitting image of it, Japanese-made , while the power-plant installation was distinctly Chance Vought, the wheel stowage into the wing roots came from Northrop, and the Japanese designers had even copied the Navy inspection stamp from Pratt & Whitney type parts. Fernandez 1983, pp. 107–108. While the sale of the V-143 was fully legal, Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 436. Wilson later acknowledged the conflicts of interest that can arise whenever military technology is exported. Counterclaims maintain that there was no significant relationship between the V-143 and the Zero, with only a superficial similarity in layout.     The Zero resembled the 1937 British  |Gloster_F.5/34|Gloster_F.5/34| . Performance of the Gloster F.5/34 was comparable to that of early model Zeros, with its dimensions and appearance remarkably close to the Zero.  Gloster had a relationship with the Japanese between the wars, with Nakajima building the carrier-based plane, the  |Gloster_Gambet|Nakajima_A1N| , under license. James 1987, p. 159 However allegations about the Zero being a copy have been discredited by some authors. Air International October 1973, pp. 199–200.          The A6M is usually known as the Zero from its Japanese Navy  |type_designation|Type| , Type 0 carrier fighter , taken from the last digit of the  |Imperial_year|Japanese_Calendaryears|  2600 when it entered service. In Japan, it was unofficially referred to as both Rei-sen and Zero-sen; Japanese pilots most commonly called it Zero-sen, where sen is the first syllable of sentōki, Japanese for fighter plane . Parshall and Tully 2007, p. 79.     In the official designation A6M , the A signified a  |carrier-based|Aircraft_Carrier|  fighter, 6 meant that it was the sixth such model built for the Imperial Navy, and M indicated  |Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi|  as the manufacturer.     The official Allied code name was Zeke , in keeping with the practice of giving male names to Japanese fighters, female names to  |bombers|Bombers| , bird names to  |gliders|Military_Glider| , and tree names to  |trainers|Trainer| . Zeke was part of the first batch of hillbilly code names assigned by Captain Frank T. McCoy of Nashville, Tennessee, , who wanted quick, distinctive, easy-to-remember names. The  |Allied_code_for_Japanese_aircraft|World_War_Ii_Allied_Names_For_Japanese_Aircraft|  was introduced in 1942, and McCoy chose Zeke for the Zero . Later, two variants of the fighter received their own code names. The  |Nakajima_A6M2-N|Nakajima_A6M2-N| |floatplane|Floatplane|  version of the Zero was called Rufe , and the A6M3-32 variant was initially called Hap . General  |Hap_Arnold|Henry_H._Arnold| , commander of the  |USAAF|Usaaf| , objected to that name, however, so it was changed to Hamp .                           The first Zeros went into operation with the 12th Rengo Kōkūtai in July 1940. Matricardi 2006, p. 88. On 13 September 1940, the Zeros scored their first air-to-air victories when 13 A6M2s led by Lieutenant Saburo Shindo attacked 27 Soviet-built  |Polikarpov_I-15s|Polikarpov_I-15|  and I-16s of the  |Chinese_Nationalist_Air_Force|Chinese_Nationalist_Air_Force| , shooting down all the fighters without loss to themselves. By the time they were redeployed a year later, the Zeros had shot down 99 Chinese aircraft Glancey 2006, p. 170. .     At the time of the  |attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor| , 521 Zeros were active in the Pacific, 328 in first-line units. Francillon 1979, p. 365. The carrier-borne Model 21 was the type encountered by the Americans. Its tremendous range of over  allowed it to range farther from its carrier than expected, appearing over distant battlefronts and giving Allied commanders the impression that there were several times as many Zeros as actually existed. Gunston 1980, p. 162.     The Zero quickly gained a fearsome reputation. Thanks to a combination of unsurpassed maneuverability — compared to contemporary Axis fighters — and excellent firepower, it easily disposed of Allied aircraft sent against it in the Pacific in 1941. Young 2013, p. 5. Nijboer 2009, p. 4. It proved a difficult opponent even for the  |Supermarine_Spitfire|Supermarine_Spitfire| . The RAF pilots were trained in methods that were excellent against German and Italian equipment but suicide against the acrobatic Japs , as  |Lt.Gen._Claire_Lee_Chennault|Claire_Lee_Chennault|  had to notice. Smith 2015, pp. 146–149. Although not as fast as the British fighter, the Mitsubishi fighter could out-turn the Spitfire with ease, sustain a climb at a very steep angle, and stay in the air for three times as long. Spick 1997, p. 165.     Allied pilots soon developed tactics to cope with the Zero. Due to its extreme agility, engaging a Zero in a traditional, turning dogfight was likely to be fatal. Spick 1983, p. 118. It was better to swoop down from above in a high-speed pass, fire a quick burst, then climb quickly back up to altitude. A short burst of fire from heavy machine guns or cannon was often enough to bring down the fragile Zero. These tactics were regularly employed by  |Grumman_F4F_Wildcat|Grumman_F4F_Wildcat|  fighters during  |Guadalcanal_defense|Guadalcanal_Campaign|  through high-altitude ambush, which was possible due to early warning system consisted of  |Coastwatchers|Coastwatchers|  and  |radar|Radar| . Lundstrom 1994. Such boom-and-zoom tactics were also successfully used in the  |China_Burma_India_Theater|China_Burma_India_Theater_Of_World_War_Ii|  by the  |Flying_Tigers|Flying_Tigers|  of the American Volunteer Group against similarly maneuverable Japanese Army aircraft such as the  |Nakajima_Ki-27_Nate|Nakajima_Ki-27|  and  |Nakajima_Ki-43_Oscar|Nakajima_Ki-43| . AVG pilots were trained by their commander Claire Chennault to exploit the advantages of their  |P-40s|Curtiss_P-40| , which were very sturdy, heavily armed, generally faster in a dive and level flight at low altitude, with a good rate of roll. Rossi, J. R.  AFG: American Volunteer Group, The Flying Tigers, 1998. Retrieved: 5 July 2011.     Another important maneuver was Lieutenant Commander  |John_S._Jimmy_Thachs|John_Thach| |Thach_Weave|Thach_Weave|  , in which two fighters would fly about  apart. If a Zero latched onto the tail of one of the fighters, the two aircraft would turn toward each other. If the Zero followed his original target through the turn, he would come into a position to be fired on by the targets wingman. This tactic was first used to good effect during the  |Battle_of_Midway|Battle_Of_Midway|  and later over the  |Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands| .     Many highly experienced Japanese aviators were lost in combat, resulting in a progressive decline in quality, which became a significant factor in Allied successes. Unexpected heavy losses of pilots at the Battles of the  |Coral_Sea|Battle_Of_Coral_Sea|  and Midway dealt the Japanese carrier air force a blow from which it never fully recovered. Holmes 2011, p. 314. Thruelsen 1976, pp. 173, 174.        Throughout the Battle of Midway Allied pilots expressed a high level of dissatisfaction with the  |Grumman_F4F_Wildcat|Grumman_F4F_Wildcat| . The Commanding Officer of  noted:  They were astounded by the Zeros superiority: Young 2013, pp. 6, 51, 82.      In contrast, Allied fighters were designed with ruggedness and pilot protection in mind. The Japanese ace  |Saburō_Sakai|Saburō_Sakai|  described how the toughness of early Grumman aircraft was a factor in preventing the Zero from attaining total domination:      When the powerfully armed  |Lockheed_P-38_Lightning|Lockheed_P-38_Lightning| , armed with four  |light_barrel_AN/M2_.50_cal._Browning|M2_Browningan/M2|  machine guns and one  |20_mm_autocannon|Hispano-Suiza_Hs.404Us_Production| , and the  |Grumman_F6F_Hellcat|Grumman_F6F_Hellcat|  and  |Vought_F4U_Corsair|Vought_F4U_Corsair| , each with six AN/M2 heavy calibre Browning guns, appeared in the Pacific theater, the A6M, with its low-powered engine and lighter armament, was hard-pressed to remain competitive. In combat with an F6F or F4U, the only positive thing that could be said of the Zero at this stage of the war was that, in the hands of a skillful pilot, it could maneuver as well as most of its opponents. Nonetheless, in competent hands, the Zero could still be deadly.     Due to shortages of high-powered aviation engines and problems with planned successor models, the Zero remained in production until 1945, with over 10,000 of all variants produced.              The American military discovered many of the A6Ms unique attributes when they recovered a largely intact specimen of an A6M2, the  |Akutan_Zero|Akutan_Zero| , on  |Akutan_Island|Akutan_Island|  in the  |Aleutians|Aleutians| . During an air raid over  |Dutch_Harbor|Dutch_Harbor|  on June 4, 1942, one A6M fighter was hit by ground-based anti-aircraft fire. Losing oil, Flight Petty Officer Tadayoshi Koga attempted an emergency landing on Akutan Island about  northeast of Dutch Harbor, but his Zero flipped over on soft ground in a sudden crash-landing. Koga died instantly of head injuries , but the relatively-undamaged fighter was found over a month later by an American salvage team and was shipped to  |Naval_Air_Station_North_Island|Naval_Air_Station_North_Island| , where testing flights of the repaired A6M revealed both strengths and deficiencies in design and performance. Wilcox 1942, p. 86. Jablonski 1979      The experts who evaluated the captured Zero found that the plane weighed about  fully loaded, some  lighter than the F4F Wildcat, the standard United States Navy fighter of the time. The A6Ms airframe was built like a fine watch ; the Zero was constructed with  |flush_rivets|Flush_Rivet| , and even the guns were flush with the wings. The instrument panel was a marvel of simplicity  ... with no superfluities to distract What most impressed the experts was that the Zeros fuselage and wings were constructed in one piece, unlike the American method that built them separately and joined the two parts together. The Japanese method was much slower, but resulted in a very strong structure and improved close maneuverability.     American test pilots found that the Zeros controls were very light at , but stiffened at faster speeds  to safeguard against wing failure. Green and Swanborough 2001  The Zero could not keep up with Allied aircraft in high-speed maneuvers, and its low  |never_exceed_speed|Vnevne|  made it vulnerable in a dive. While stable on the ground despite its light weight, the aircraft was designed purely for the attack role, emphasizing long range, maneuverability, and firepower at the expense of protection of its pilot. Most lacked  |self-sealing_tanks|Self-Sealing_Fuel_Tank|  and armor plating.       Captain  |Eric_Brown|Eric_Brown| , the Chief Naval Test Pilot of the Royal Navy, recalled being impressed by the Zero during tests of captured aircraft. I dont think I have ever flown a fighter that could match the rate of turn of the Zero. The Zero had ruled the roost totally and was the finest fighter in the world until mid-1943.              The first two A6M1 prototypes were completed in March 1939, powered by the   |Mitsubishi_Zuisei|Mitsubishi_Zuisei|  13 engine with a two-blade propeller. It first flew on 1 April, and passed testing within a remarkably short period. By September, it had already been accepted for Navy testing as the A6M1 Type 0 Carrier Fighter, with the only notable change being a switch to a three-bladed propeller to cure a vibration problem.          While the navy was testing the first two prototypes, they suggested that the third be fitted with the   |Nakajima_Sakae|Nakajima_Sakae|  12 engine instead. Mitsubishi had its own engine of this class in the form of the  |Kinsei|Mitsubishi_Kinsei| , so they were somewhat reluctant to use the Sakae. Nevertheless, when the first A6M2 was completed in January 1940, the Sakaes extra power pushed the performance of the Zero well past the original specifications.     The new version was so promising that the Navy had 15 built and shipped to China before they had completed testing. They arrived in  |Manchuria|Manchuria|  in July 1940, and first saw combat over  |Chungking|Chungking|  in August. There they proved to be completely untouchable by the  |Polikarpov_I-16s|Polikarpov_I-16|  and  |I-153s|Polikarpov_I-153|  that had been such a problem for the A5Ms when in service. In one encounter, 13 Zeros shot down 27 I-15s and I-16s in under three minutes without loss. After hearing of these reports, the navy immediately ordered the A6M2 into production as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter, Model 11.   Reports of the Zeros performance filtered back to the US slowly. There they were dismissed by most military officials, who thought it was impossible for the Japanese to build such an aircraft.          After the delivery of the 65th aircraft, a further change was worked into the production lines, which introduced folding wingtips to allow them to fit on  |aircraft_carriers|Aircraft_Carrier| . The resulting Model 21 would become one of the most produced versions early in the war. A feature was the improved range with  wing tank and  drop tank. When the lines switched to updated models, 740 Model 21s had been completed by Mitsubishi, and another 800 by Nakajima. Two other versions of the Model 21 were built in small numbers, the Nakajima-built  |A6M2-N|Nakajima_A6M2-N|  Rufe  |floatplane|Floatplane|  , and the A6M2-K two-seat trainer of which a total of 508 were built by Hitachi and the Sasebo Naval Air Arsenal. Francillon 1979, p. 399.            In 1941, Nakajima introduced the Sakae 21 engine, which used a two-speed  |supercharger|Supercharger|  for better altitude performance, and increased power to . A prototype Zero with the new engine was first flown on July 15, 1941. Nohara 1993, p. 76.     The new Sakae was slightly heavier and somewhat longer due to the larger supercharger, which moved the  |center_of_gravity|Center_Of_Gravity|  too far forward on the existing airframe. To correct for this, the engine mountings were cut back by  to move the engine toward the cockpit. This had the side effect of reducing the size of the main fuselage fuel tank from  to . The cowling was redesigned to enlarge the cowl flaps, revise the oil cooler air intake, and move the carburetor air intake to the upper half of the cowling. Nohara 1993, p. 51. Reisen no Tsuioku , 2013, p.  75.     The wings were redesigned to reduce span, eliminate the folding tips, and square off the wingtips. The inboard edge of the aileron was moved outboard by one rib, and the wing fuel tanks were enlarged accordingly to . The two 20  mm wing cannon were upgraded from the  |Type_99_Mark_l|Type_99_Cannon|  to the  |Type_99_Mark_II|Type_99_Cannon| , which required a bulge in the sheet metal of the wing below each cannon. The wings also included larger ammunition boxes and thus allowing 100 rounds per cannon.     The Sakae 21 engine and other changes increased maximum speed by only  compared to the Model 21, but sacrificed nearly  of range. Nevertheless, the navy accepted the type and it entered production in April 1942.     The shorter wing span led to better roll, and the reduced drag allowed the diving speed to be increased to . On the downside, turning and range, which were the strengths of the Model 21, suffered due to smaller ailerons, decreased lift and greater fuel consumption. The shorter range proved a significant limitation during the Solomons Campaign, during which Zeros based at Rabaul had to travel nearly to their maximum range to reach Guadalcanal and return. Mechanic of World Aircraft Vol. 5, Koujinsha, 1994, pp. 220–221. Consequently, the Model 32 was unsuited to that campaign Nohara 1993, pp. 76–77. and was used mainly for shorter range offensive missions and interception.     The appearance of the redesigned A6M3-32 prompted the US to assign the Model 32 a new code name, Hap . This name was short-lived, as a protest from  |USAAF|Usaaf|  Commanding General  |Henry_Hap_Arnold|Henry_H._Arnold|  forced a change to Hamp . Soon after, it was realized that it was simply a new model of the Zeke and was termed Zeke 32 .     This variant was flown by only a small number of units, and only 343 were built.         In order to correct the deficiencies of the Model 32, a new version with folding wingtips and redesigned wing was introduced. The fuel tanks were moved to the outer wings, fuel lines for a  drop tank were installed under each wing and the internal fuel capacity was increased to . More importantly, it regained its capabilities for long operating ranges, similar to the previous A6M2 Model 21, which was vastly shortened by the Model 32.     However, before the new design type was accepted formally by the Navy, the A6M3 Model 22 already stood ready for service in December 1942. Approximately 560 aircraft of the new type had been produced in the meantime by Mitsubishi Jukogyo K.K. Nohara 1993, p. 78.     According to a theory, the very late production Model 22 might have had wings similar to the shortened, rounded-tip wing of the Model 52. Mikesh 1994. p. 90. One plane of such arrangement was photographed at  |Lakunai_Airfield|Lakunai_Airfield|  in the second half of 1943, and has been published widely in a number of Japanese books. While the engine cowling is the same of previous Model 32 and 22, the theory proposes that the plane is an early production Model 52. Famous Airplanes of the World 9, 1993 p. 33.     The Model 32, 22, 22 kou, 52, 52 kou and 52 otsu were all powered by the Nakajima    engine. That engine kept its designation in spite of changes in the exhaust system for the Model 52.       Mitsubishi is unable to state with certainty that it ever used the designation A6M4 or model numbers for it. However, A6M4 does appear in a translation of a captured Japanese memo from a Naval Air Technical Arsenal, titled Quarterly Report on Research Experiments, dated 1 October 1942. It mentions a cross-section of the A6M4 intercooler then being designed. Some researchers believe A6M4 was applied to one or two prototype planes fitted with an experimental turbo-supercharged Sakae engine designed for high altitude. Mikesh 1981, p. 32. Mitsubishis involvement in the project was probably quite limited or nil; the unmodified Sakae engine was made by Nakajima. The design and testing of the turbo-supercharger was the responsibility of the First Naval Air Arsenal  at Yokosuka. Quarterly Report on Research Experiments , Vol. 1, 30 March 1945. CINCPAC-CINCPOA Bulletin, Special Translation No. 52, No. 67–45, p. 14 D. At least one photo of a prototype plane exists. It shows a turbo unit mounted in the forward left fuselage.     Lack of suitable alloys for use in the manufacture of a turbo-supercharger and its related ducting caused numerous ruptures, resulting in fires and poor performance. Consequently, further development of a turbo-supercharged A6M was cancelled. The lack of acceptance by the navy suggests that the navy did not bestow model number 41 or 42 formally, although it appears that the arsenal did use the designation A6M4 . The prototype engines nevertheless provided useful experience for future engine designs.  J-Aircraft.com. Retrieved: 13 October 2010.                  Sometimes considered as the most effective variant, Mikesh 1994, p. 53. the Model 52 was developed to again shorten the wings to increase speed and dispense with the folding wing mechanism.
