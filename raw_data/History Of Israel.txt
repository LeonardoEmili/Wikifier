                  The  |Land_of_Israel|Land_Of_Israel| , also known as the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land|  or  |Palestine|Palestine| , is the birthplace of the  |Jewish_people|Jews| , the place where the final form of the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible|  is thought to have been compiled, and the birthplace of  |Judaism|Judaism|  and  |Christianity|Christianity| .

The region has come under the sway of various empires and, as a result, has hosted a wide variety of ethnicities. However, the land was predominantly  |Jewish|Jewish|   from roughly 1,000 years before the Common Era until the 3rd century of the  |Common_Era_|Common_Era| . The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History, 70–1492 , by Botticini and Eckstein, Chapter 1, especially page 17, Princeton 2012 The adoption of Christianity by the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  in the 4th century led to a Greco-Roman Christian majority which lasted not just until the 7th century when the area was conquered by the  |Arab_Muslim_Empires|Caliphate| , but for another full six centuries. It gradually became predominantly Muslim after the end of the  |Crusader_period|Kingdom_Of_Jerusalem|  , during which it was the focal point of conflict between Christianity and Islam. From the 13th century it was mainly Muslim with Arabic as the dominant language and was first part of the Syrian province of the  |Mamluk_Sultanate|Mamluk_Sultanate|  and after 1516 part of the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  until the  |British_conquest_in_1917_18|Sinai_And_Palestine_Campaign| .     A Jewish national movement,  |Zionism|Zionism| , emerged in the late-19th century , as part of which  |Aliyah|Aliyah|   increased. During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the British government publicly committed to create a  |Jewish_National_Home|Jewish_National_Home|  and was granted a  |Mandate_to_rule_Palestine|British_Mandate_For_Palestine|  by the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  for this purpose. A rival  |Arab_nationalism|Arab_Nationalism|  also claimed rights over the former Ottoman territories and sought to prevent Jewish migration into Palestine, leading to growing  |Arab–Jewish_tensions|Intercommunal_Conflict_In_Mandatory_Palestine| .  |Israeli_independence|Israeli_Declaration_Of_Independence|  in 1948 was accompanied by an exodus of  |Arabs|1948_Palestinian_Exodus|  from Israel, the  |Arab–Israeli_conflict|Arab–Israeli_Conflict|   and a subsequent  |Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries|Jewish_Exodus_From_Arab_And_Muslim_Countries|  to Israel. About 43% of the  |worlds_Jews|Jewish_Population_By_Country|  live in Israel today, the largest Jewish community in the world.      Since about 1970, the  |United_States|United_States|  has become the principal  |ally_of_Israel|Israel–United_States_Relations| . In 1979, an uneasy  |Egypt–Israel_Peace_Treaty|Egypt–Israel_Peace_Treaty|  was signed, based on the  |Camp_David_Accords|Camp_David_Accords| . In 1993, Israel signed  |Oslo_I_Accord|Oslo_I_Accord|  with the  |Palestine_Liberation_Organization|Palestine_Liberation_Organization| , followed by establishment of the  |Palestinian_National_Authority|Palestinian_National_Authority|  and in 1994  |Israel–Jordan_peace_treaty|Israel–Jordan_Peace_Treaty|  was signed. Despite  |efforts_to_finalize_the_peace_agreement|Israeli–Palestinian_Peace_Process| , the conflict continues to play a major role in Israeli and international political, social and economic life.     The  |economy_of_Israel|Economy_Of_Israel|  was initially primarily  |democratic_socialist|Social_Democracy|  and the country dominated by social democratic parties until the 1970s. Since then the Israeli economy has gradually moved to capitalism and a free market economy, partially retaining the social welfare system.             Between 2.6 and 0.9 million years ago, at least four episodes of  |hominine|Hominine|  dispersal from Africa to the Levant are known, each culturally distinct. The oldest evidence of  |early_humans|Early_Humans|  in the territory of modern Israel, dating to 1.5 million years ago, was found in  |Ubeidiya|Ubeidiya|  near the  |Sea_of_Galilee|Sea_Of_Galilee| .  The flint tool artefacts have been discovered at  |Yiron|Yiron| , the oldest stone tools found anywhere outside Africa. Other groups include 1.4 million years old  |Acheulean|Acheulean|  industry, the Bizat Ruhama group and  |Gesher_Bnot_Yaakov|Gesher_Bnot_Yaakov| .      In the Carmel mountain range at  |el_Tabun|Tabun_Israel| , and  |Es_Skhul|Es_Skhul| ,   |Neanderthal|Neanderthal|  and early modern human remains were found, including the skeleton of a Neanderthal female, named Tabun I, which is regarded as one of the most important human fossils ever found. Christopher Stringer, custodian of Tabun I,  |Natural_History_Museum|Natural_History_Museum_London| , quoted in an exhibition in honour of Garrod; Callander and Smith, 1998 The excavation at el-Tabun produced the longest  |stratigraphic_record|Stratigraphy|  in the region, spanning 600,000 or more years of human activity,  from the  |Lower_Paleolithic|Lower_Paleolithic|  to the present day, representing roughly a million years of  |human_evolution|Human_Evolution| .  Other notable  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  sites include caves  |Qesem|Qesem_Cave|  and  |Manot|Manot_Cave| . The oldest fossils of  |anatomically_modern_humans|Anatomically_Modern_Human|  found  |outside_Africa|Recent_African_Origin_Of_Modern_Humans|  are the  |Skhul_and_Qafzeh_hominids|Skhul_And_Qafzeh_Hominids| , who lived in northern Israel 120,000 years ago.  Around 10th millennium BCE, the  |Natufian_culture|Natufian_Culture|  existed in the area.                     During the 2nd millennium BCE,  |Canaan|Canaan| , part of which later became known as Israel, was dominated by the  |New_Kingdom_of_Egypt|New_Kingdom_Of_Egypt|  from c.1550 to c. 1180.   The earliest recorded battle in history took place in 1457 BCE, at  |Megiddo|Tel_Megiddo|  , between Canaanite forces and those of Pharoh  |Thutmose_III|Thutmose_Iii| . The Canaanites left no written history, but Thutmoses scribe,  |Tjaneni|Tjaneni|  recorded the battle.                 The first record of the name Israel  occurs in the  |Merneptah_stele|Merneptah_Stele| , erected for Egyptian Pharaoh  |Merneptah|Merneptah|   c. 1209 BCE, Israel is laid waste and his seed is not. Stager in Coogan 1998, p. 91.  |William_G_Dever|William_G_Dever|  sees this Israel in the central highlands as a cultural and probably political entity, more an ethnic group rather than an organized state. Dever 2003, p. 206.     Ancestors of the Israelites may have included  |Semites|Ancient_Semitic_Speaking_Peoples|  native to  |Canaan|Canaan|  and the  |Sea_Peoples|Sea_Peoples| . Miller 1986, pp. 78–9. McNutt says, It is probably safe to assume that sometime during  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  I a population began to identify itself as Israelite , differentiating itself from the  |Canaanites|Canaanites|  through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage, an emphasis on family history and genealogy, and religion. McNutt 1999, p. 35.     The archeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres, but with more limited resources and a small population. Lehman in Vaughn 1992, pp. 156–62. Villages had populations of up to 300 or 400, McNutt 1999, p. 70. Miller 2005, p. 98. which lived by farming and herding, and were largely self-sufficient; McNutt 1999, p. 72. economic interchange was prevalent. Miller 2005, p. 99. Writing was known and available for recording, even in small sites. Miller 2005, p. 105.       The first use of  |grapheme|Grapheme| -based  |writing_originated_in_the_area|Proto_Sinaitic_Script| , probably among Canaanite peoples resident in Egypt. This evolved into the  |Phoenician_alphabet|Phoenician_Alphabet|  from which all modern  |alphabetical_writing_systems|Alphabet|  are descended. The  |Paleo_Hebrew_alphabet|Paleo_Hebrew_Alphabet|  was one of the first to develop and evidence of its use exists from about 1000 BCE  , the language spoken was probably  |Biblical_Hebrew|Biblical_Hebrew| .      |Monotheism|Monotheism| , the belief in a single all-powerful law-giving God is thought to have evolved among the Hebrew speakers gradually, over the next few centuries, from a number of separate cults, Othmar Keel, Christoph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel, Fortress Press ; Mark S. Smith, The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel’s Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts, Oxford University Press leading to the first versions of the religion now known as  |Judaism|Judaism| .             The  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible|  describes constant warfare between the  |Israelites|Israelites|  and the  |Philistines|Philistines|  whose capital was  |Gaza|Gaza_City| . The Phillistines were Greek refugee-settlers who inhabited the southern Levantine coast. Ann E. Killebrew, Biblical Peoples and Ethnicity: An Archaeological Study of Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and Early Israel, 1300–1100 B.C.E, Society of Biblical Lit, 2005 p.230. The Bible states that  |King_David|King_David|  founded a dynasty of kings and that his son  |Solomon|Solomon|  built a  |temple|Solomons_Temple| . Both David and Solomon are widely referenced in Jewish, Christian and Islamic texts. Standard Biblical chronology suggests that around 930 BCE, following the death of Solomon, the  |kingdom|Kingdom_Of_Israel|  split into a southern  |Kingdom_of_Judah|Kingdom_Of_Judah|  and a northern  |Kingdom_of_Israel|Kingdom_Of_Israel| . The Bibles  |Books_of_Kings|Books_Of_Kings|  state that soon after the split Pharoh  |Shishaq|Shishaq|  invaded the country  |plundering_Jerusalem|Sack_Of_Jerusalem| .  An inscription over a  |gate_at_Karnak|Bubastite_Portal|  in Egypt recounts such an invasion by Pharoh  |Sheshonq_I|Sheshonq_I| . Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, page 335, Oxford 2000     The archeological evidence for this period is extremely sparse, leading some scholars to suggest that this section of the Hebrew Bible, which includes texts written two centuries later, exaggerates the importance of David and Solomon.  The earliest references to the  |House_of_David|Davidic_Dynasty|  have been found in two inscriptions, on the  |Tel_Dan_Stele|Tel_Dan_Stele|  and the  |Mesha_Stele|Mesha_Stele| ; the latter is a  |Moab|Moab| ite stele, now in the Louvre, which describes an 840 BCE invasion of Moab by  |Omri|Omri| , king of Israel.  |Jehu|Jehu| , son of Omri, is referenced by  |Assyrian_records|Black_Obelisk_Of_Shalmaneser_Iii|  . Modern archeological findings show that Omris capital city,  |Samaria|Samaria| , was large and Finkelstein has suggested that the Biblical account of David and Solomon are an attempt by later Judean rulers to ascribe Israels successes to their dynasty.            In 854 BCE, according to Assyrian records   an alliance between  |Ahab|Ahab|  of Israel and Ben Hadad II of  |Aram_Damascus|Aram_Damascus|  managed to repulse the incursions of the  |Assyrians|Assyrian_People| , with a victory at the  |Battle_of_Qarqar|Battle_Of_Qarqar| . This is not included in the Bible which describes conflict between Ahab and Ben Hadad. Kings 1 chapter 20 Around 750 BCE, the Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by  |Assyria|Assyria| n king  |Tiglath_Pileser_III|Tiglath_Pileser_Iii| . Kings 2 chapter 15 The Philistine kingdom was also destroyed. The Assyrians sent most of the population of the northern Israelite kingdom into  |exile|Assyrian_Captivity_Of_Israel| , thus creating the  |Lost_Tribes_of_Israel|Lost_Tribes_Of_Israel|  . The  |Samaritans|Samaritan|  claim to be descended from survivors of the Assyrian conquest. An Israelite revolt was crushed after the siege and capture of  |Samaria|Samaria|  by the Assyrian king  |Sargon_II|Sargon_Ii| .     Modern scholars believe that refugees from the destruction of Israel moved to Judah, massively expanding Jerusalem and leading to construction of the  |Siloam_Tunnel|Siloam_Tunnel|  during the rule of King  |Hezekiah|Hezekiah|  .  The tunnel could provide water during a siege and its construction is described in the Bible.  A  |Hebrew_plaque|Siloam_Inscription|  left by the construction team still exists.     Sargons son,  |Sennacherib|Sennacherib| , tried and failed to  |conquer|Sennacheribs_Campaign_In_Judah|  Judah, during Hezekiahs reign.  |Assyrian_records|Taylor_Prism|  say that Sennacherib levelled 46 walled cities and  |besieged_Jerusalem|Assyrian_Siege_Of_Jerusalem| , leaving after receiving extensive tribute. The Bible also refers to tribute, Kings 2, chapter 18 and suggests that Hezekiah was aided by  |Taharqa|Taharqa| , king of  |Kush|Kingdom_Of_Kush|  , in repulsing the Assyrians. The  |Twenty_fifth_Dynasty_of_Egypt|Twenty_Fifth_Dynasty_Of_Egypt|  were  |Nubia|Nubia| n Pharohs and they probably defeated the Assyrians. , see also The Rescue of Jerusalem: The Alliance between Hebrews and Africans in 701 BC by Henry Aubin, Random House 2002 Sennacherib had a 12 meter by 5-metre frieze  |erected_in_his_palace|Lachish_Reliefs|  in  |Nineveh|Nineveh|   depicting his victory at  |Lachish|Lachish| , the second largest city in Judah.     The Bible describes a tradition of religious men  exercising some form of  |free_speech|Free_Speech|  and criticizing rulers. The most famous of these was  |Isaiah|Isaiah| , who witnessed the Assyrian invasion and warned of its consequences.     Under King  |Josiah|Josiah|  , the book of  |Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy|  was either rediscovered or written. The  |Book_of_Joshua|Book_Of_Joshua|  and the accounts of the kingship of David and Solomon in the  |book_of_Kings|Books_Of_Kings|  are believed to have the same author. The books are known as  |Deuteronomist|Deuteronomist|  and considered to be a key step in the emergence of  |Monotheism|Monotheism|  in Judah. They emerged at a time that Assyria was weakened by the emergence of Babylon and may be a committing to text of pre-writing verbal traditions. The Social Roots of Biblical Yahwism by Stephen Cook, SBL 2004 pp 58             In 586 BCE King  |Nebuchadnezzar_II|Nebuchadnezzar_Ii|  of  |Babylon|Babylon| |_conquered|Jewish–Babylonian_War|  Judah. According to the Hebrew Bible, he destroyed  |Solomons_Temple|Solomons_Temple|  and  |exiled|Babylonian_Captivity|  the Jews to Babylon. The Phillistines were also driven into exile. The defeat of Judah was recorded by the Babylonians   . Babylonian and Biblical sources suggest that the Judean king,  |Jehoiachin|Jehoiachin| , switched allegiances between the Egyptians and the Babylonians and that invasion was a punishment for allying with Babylons principal rival, Egypt. The exiled Jews may have been restricted to the elite. Jehoiachin was eventually released by the Babylonians. Tablets which seem to describe his rations were found in the ruins of Babylon . According to both the Bible and the Talmud, the Judean royal family  continued as head of Babylonian Jewry, called the  |_Rosh_Galut_|Exilarch|  . Arab and Jewish sources show that the Rosh Galut continued to exist for another 1,500 years, ending in the eleventh century.         In 538 BCE,  |Cyrus_the_Great|Cyrus|  of  |Persia|Persia|  conquered Babylon and took over its empire. Cyrus issued a proclamation granting subjugated nations religious freedom . According to the Hebrew Bible 50,000 Judeans, led by  |Zerubabel|Zerubabel| ,  |returned_to_Judah|Return_To_Zion|  and  |rebuilt_the_temple|Second_Temple_Of_Jerusalem| . A second group of 5,000, led by  |Ezra|Ezra|  and  |Nehemiah|Nehemiah| , returned to Judah in 456 BCE although non-Jews wrote to Cyrus to try to prevent their return. Modern scholars believe that the final Hebrew versions of the  |Torah|Torah|  and  |Books_of_Kings|Books_Of_Kings| |_date_from_this_period|Authorship_Of_The_Bible| , that the returning  |Israelites|Israelites|  adopted an  |Aramaic_script|Aramaic_Script|  , which they brought back from Babylon; this is the current Hebrew script. The  |Hebrew_calendar|Hebrew_Calendar|  closely resembles the  |Babylonian_calendar|Babylonian_Calendar|  and probably dates from this period.      The Persians also conquered Egypt, posting a Judean military garrison on  |Elephantine_Island|Elephantine_Island|  near Aswan. In the early 20th century  |175_papyrus_documents|Elephantine_Papyri|  were discovered, recording activity in this community, including the Passover Papyrus , a letter instructing the garrison on how to correctly conduct the  |Passover|Passover|  feast.      In 333 BCE, the  |Macedonian|Ancient_Macedonians|  ruler  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  defeated  |Persia|Achaemenid_Empire|  and  |conquered|Alexander_The_Greategypt|  the region. Sometime thereafter, the first translation of the Hebrew Bible, the  |Septuagint|Septuagint| , was begun in  |Alexandria|Alexandria| . After Alexanders death, his generals fought over the territory he had conquered. Judah became the frontier between the  |Seleucid_Empire|Seleucid_Empire|  and  |Ptolemaic_Egypt|Ptolemaic_Egypt| , eventually becoming part of the Seleucid Empire in 200 BCE at the  |battle_of_Panium|Battle_Of_Panium|  .             In the 2nd century BCE, Seleucid ruler  |Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes|Antiochus_Iv_Epiphanes|  tried to eradicate Judaism in favour of  |Hellenistic_religion|Hellenistic_Religion| . This provoked the 174–135 BCE  |Maccabean_Revolt|Maccabean_Revolt|  led by  |Judas_Maccabeus|Judas_Maccabeus|  . The  |Books_of_the_Maccabees|Books_Of_The_Maccabees|  describe the uprising and the end of Greek rule.     A Jewish party called the  |Hasideans|Hasideans|  opposed both Hellenism and the revolt, but eventually gave their support to the Maccabees. Modern interpretations see the initial stages of the uprising as a civil war between Hellenised and orthodox forms of Judaism.       The  |Hasmonean|Hasmonean|  dynasty of Jewish  |priest_kings|Kohen_Gadol|  ruled  |Judea|Judea|  with the  |Pharisees|Pharisees| ,  |Sadducees|Sadducees|  and  |Essenes|Essenes|  as the principal Jewish social movements. As part of the struggle against  |Hellenistic_civilization|Hellenistic_Civilization| , the Pharisee leader  |Simeon_ben_Shetach|Simeon_Ben_Shetach|  established the first schools based around  |meeting_houses|Synagogue| .  |Paul_Johnson|Paul_Johnson| , History of the Jews, p. 106, Harper 1988 This led to  |Rabbinical_Judaism|Rabbinical_Judaism| . Justice was administered by the  |Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin| , which was a Rabbincal assembly and law court whose leader was known as the  |Nasi|Nasi| . The Nasis religious authority gradually superseded that of the Temples  |high_priest|Kohen_Gadol| , who under the Hasmoneans was the king himself.      The Hasmoneans continually extended their control over much of the region.  In 125 BCE the Hasmonean  |ethnarch|Ethnarch| |_John_Hyrcanus|John_Hyrcanus|  subjugated  |Edom|Edom|  and forcibly converted its population to  |Judaism|Judaism| .      Hyrcanus son  |Alexander_Jannaeus|Alexander_Jannaeus|  established good relations with the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic| , however there was growing tension between Pharisees and Sadducees and a conflict over the succession to Janneus, in which the warring parties invited foreign intervention on their behalf.          In 64 BCE the  |Roman|Roman_Republic|  general  |Pompey|Pompeypompey_In_The_East| |_conquered|Third_Mithridatic_War|  Syria and  |intervened|Siege_Of_Jerusalem|  in the  |Hasmonean_civil_war|Hasmonean_Civil_War|  in Jerusalem, restoring  |Hyrcanus_II|Hyrcanus_Ii|  as High Priest and making Judea a Roman vassal kingdom. During the  |siege_of_Alexandria_in_47_BCE|Siege_Of_Alexandria| , the lives of  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  and his  |protégé|Protégé| |_Cleopatra|Cleopatra|  were saved by 3,000 Jewish troops sent by Hyrcanus II and commanded by  |Antipater|Antipater_The_Idumaean| , whose descendants Caesar made kings of Judea. Julius Caesar: The Life and Times of the Peoples Dictator By Luciano Canfora chapter 24 Caesar Saved by the Jews .             From 37 BCE to 6 CE, the  |Herodian_dynasty|Herodian_Dynasty| , Jewish-Roman client kings, descended from Antipater, ruled Judea.  |Herod_the_Great|Herod_The_Great|  considerably enlarged the temple , making it one of the largest religious structures in the world. At this time, Jews formed as much as 10% A Concise History of the Jewish People By Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman 1995 , page 67 of the population of the entire Roman Empire, with large communities in North Africa and Arabia. Despite the fame of the temple,  |Rabbinical_Judaism|Rabbinical_Judaism| , led by  |Hillel_the_Elder|Hillel_The_Elder| , began to assume popular prominence over the  |Temple_priesthood|Kohen| . The Romans gave the  |Jewish_Temple|Second_Temple|  in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  permission not to display an effigy of the emperor, the only religious structure in the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  that was exempt. Special dispensation was granted for Jewish citizens of the Roman Empire to pay a  |tax_to_the_temple|Fiscus_Judaicus| .      |Augustus|Augustus|  made Judea a Roman province in 6 CE, deposing the last Jewish king,  |Herod_Archelaus|Herod_Archelaus| , and appointing a Roman governor. There was a small revolt against Roman taxation led by  |Judas_of_Galilee|Judas_Of_Galilee|  and over the next decades tensions grew between the Greco-Roman and Judean population centered on attempts to place effigies of the Emperor  |Caligula|Caligula|  in Synagogues and in the Jewish temple. Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.203.       |Jesus|Jesus|  was born in the last years of Herods rule, probably in the Judean city of Bethlehem. Jesus is thought to have been a Galilean Jewish reformer , and was executed in Jerusalem by the Roman governor  |Pontius_Pilate|Pontius_Pilate|  between 25 and 35 CE. All his key followers, the  |Twelve_Apostles|Twelve_Apostles| , were Jews including  |Paul_the_Apostle|Paul_The_Apostle|  who took critical steps towards creating a new religion, defining Jesus as the Son of God . In the year 50 CE, the  |Council_of_Jerusalem|Council_Of_Jerusalem|  led by Paul, decided to abandon the Jewish requirement of circumcision and the Torah, creating a form of Judaism highly accessible to non-Jews and with a more  |universal_notion_of_God|Universalism| . Another Jewish follower,  |Peter|Saint_Peter|  is believed to have become the first Pope.     In 64 CE, the Temple High Priest  |Joshua_ben_Gamla|Joshua_Ben_Gamla|  introduced a religious requirement for Jewish boys to learn to read from the age of six. Over the next few hundred years this requirement became steadily more ingrained in Jewish tradition. The Chosen Few: How education shaped Jewish History, Botticini and Eckstein, Princeton 2012, page 71 and chapters 4 and 5             In 66 CE, the Jews of Judea rose in  |revolt|First_Jewish–Roman_War|  against Rome, naming their new state as Israel . Martin Goodman, Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations, Penguin 2008 pp. 18–19 The events were described by the Jewish leader and historian  |Josephus|Josephus| , including the defence of  |Jotapata|Siege_Of_Yodfat| , the  |siege_of_Jerusalem|Siege_Of_Jerusalem|  and the desperate last stand at  |Masada|Siege_Of_Masada|  under  |Eleazar_ben_Yair|Eleazar_Ben_Yair|  .     Josephus estimated that over a million people died in the siege of Jerusalem. The Temple and most of Jerusalem was destroyed. During the Jewish revolt, most  |Christians|History_Of_Christianity| , at this time a sub-sect of Judaism, removed themselves from Judea. The rabbinical/ |Pharisee|Pharisee|  movement led by  |Yochanan_ben_Zakai|Yochanan_Ben_Zakai| , who opposed the  |Sadducee|Sadducee|  temple priesthood, made peace with Rome and survived. After the war  |Jews_continued_to_be_taxed|Taxation_Of_The_Jews|  in the  |Fiscus_Judaicus|Fiscus_Judaicus| , which was used to fund a temple to Jupiter. A  |victory_arch|Arch_Of_Titus|  erected in Rome can still be seen today.     Tensions and attacks on Jews around the Roman Empire led to a massive Jewish uprising against Rome from 115 to 117. Jews in Libya, Egypt, Cyprus and Mesopotamia  |fought_against_Rome|Kitos_War| . This conflict was accompanied by large-scale massacres of both sides. Cyprus was so severely depopulated that new settlers were imported and Jews banned from living there.      In 131, the Emperor  |Hadrian|Hadrian|  renamed Jerusalem  |Aelia_Capitolina|Aelia_Capitolina|  and constructed a Temple of Jupiter on the site of the former Jewish temple. Jews were banned from living in Jerusalem itself , and the Roman province, until then known as  |Iudaea_Province|Iudaea_Province| , was renamed  |Palaestina|Syria_Palaestina| , no other revolt led to a province being renamed. Martin Goodman, Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations, Penguin 2008 p. 494 The names Palestine and Filistin are derived from this.        From 132 to 136, the Jewish leader  |Simon_Bar_Kokhba|Simon_Bar_Kokhba|  led another major  |revolt|Bar_Kokhba_Revolt|  against the Romans, again renaming the country Israel Martin Goodman, Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations, Penguin 2008 p. 490 . The Bar-Kochba revolt probably caused more trouble for the Romans than the better documented revolt of 70. M. Avi-Yonah, The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule, Jerusalem 1984 pp. 12–14 Christians refused to participate in the revolt and from this point the Jews regarded Christianity as a separate religion. M. Avi-Yonah, The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule, Jerusalem 1984 p. 143 The revolt was eventually crushed by  |Emperor_Hadrian|Emperor_Hadrian|  himself. During the Bar Kokhba revolt a  |rabbinical_assembly_decided|Council_Of_Jamnia|  which  |books_could_be_regarded|Development_Of_The_Hebrew_Bible_Canon|  as part of the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| |Jewish_apocrypha|Jewish_Apocrypha|  and Christian books were excluded. For more information see The Canon Debate edited by McDonald and Sanders, 2002 Hendrickson As a result, the original text of some Hebrew texts, including the  |Books_of_Maccabees|Books_Of_Maccabees|  were lost .     A rabbi of this period,  |Simeon_bar_Yochai|Simeon_Bar_Yochai| , is regarded as the author of the  |Zohar|Zohar| , the foundational text for Kabbalistic thought. However, modern scholars believe it was written in Medieval Spain.        After suppressing the Bar Kochba revolt, the Romans  |exiled|Jewish_Diaspora|  the Jews of Judea, but not of Galilee and permitted a hereditary Rabbinical Patriarch , called the  |Nasi|Nasi|  to represent the Jews in dealings with the Romans. The most famous of these was  |Judah_haNasi|Judah_Hanasi|  who is credited with compiling the final version of the  |Mishnah|Mishnah|  and with strengthening the educational demands of Judaism by requiring that illiterate Jews be treated as outcasts. As a result, many illiterate Jews may have converted to Christianity.

However,  |economic_mismanagement_of_the_Roman_economy|Crisis_Of_The_Third_Century|  in the third century led to a collapse of Roman trade and empire, as well as increased taxation and persecution,  which caused most Jews to migrate to the more tolerant Persian  |Sassanid_Empire|Sassanid_Empire| , where a prosperous Jewish community with  |extensive_seminaries|Talmudic_Academies_In_Babylonia|  existed in the area of Babylon.       Early in the 4th century, the Emperor  |Constantine|Constantine_The_Great|  made  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  the capital of the  |East_Roman_Empire|East_Roman_Empire|  and made  |Christianity|Christianity|  an accepted religion.

Byzantine Christianity was dominated by the  |Eastern_Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  whose massive land ownership has extended into the present. In the 5th century, the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire|  collapsed leading to Christian migration into the Roman province of  |Palaestina_Prima|Palaestina_Prima|  and development of a Christian majority. Jews numbered 10–15% of the population, concentrated largely in the Galilee. Judaism was the only non-Christian religion tolerated, but restrictions on Jews slowly increased to include a ban on building new places of worship, holding public office or owning slaves. In 425, following the death of the last Nasi,  |Gamliel_VI|Gamliel_Vi| , the  |Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin|  was officially abolished and the title of  |Nasi|Nasi|  banned.

Following the Byzantine re-entry,  |Heraclius|Heraclius|  massacred the Jewish population of Gallilee and Jerusalem and renewed the ban on Jews entering Jerusalem. Benjamin of Tiberias was converted to Christianity.

During the 8th century, the Caliph  |Umar_II|Umar_Ii|  introduced a law requiring Jews and Christians to wear identifying clothing: Jews were required to wear  |yellow_stars|Yellow_Badge|  round their neck and on their hats. Christians had to wear Blue. Clothing regulations were not always enforced, but did arise during repressive periods and were sometimes designed to humiliate and persecute non-Muslims.  |A_poll_tax_was_imposed_on_all_non_Muslims|Jizya|  by all Islamic rulers and failure to pay could result in imprisonment or worse. The Cairo Geniza as a Source for the History of Muslim Civilisation by S. D. Goitein in Studia Islamica No. 3 , pp. 75–91 Non-Muslims were banned from travelling unless they could show a tax receipt. There were also bans on construction of new places of worship and repair of existing places of worship. The system of requiring Jews to wear yellow stars was subsequently adopted also in parts of Christian Europe.     In 982, Caliph  |Al_Aziz_Billah|Al_Aziz_Billah|  of the Cairo-based  |Fatimid_dynasty|Fatimid_Caliphate|  conquered the region. The Fatimids were followers of  |Ismailism|Ismailism| , a branch of  |Shia_Islam|Shia_Islam|  and claimed descent from  |Fatima|Fatimah| , Mohammeds daughter. Around the year 1,010 the  |Church_of_Holy_Sepulchre|Church_Of_Holy_Sepulchre|  , was destroyed by Fatimid  |Caliph_al_Hakim|Al_Hakim_Bi_Amr_Allah| , who relented ten years later and paid for it to be rebuilt. In 1020 al-Hakim claimed divine status and the newly formed  |Druze|Druze|  religion gave him the status of a messiah.

His religious writings  are still studied by Orthodox Jews. Maimonides was  |buried_in_Tiberias|Tomb_Of_Maimonides| . A Crusader city-state at  |Acre|Acre_Israel|  survived for another century.     In 1229, Jerusalem peacefully reverted into Christian control as part of a treaty between Holy Roman Emperor  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and Ayyubid sultan  |al_Kamil|Al_Kamil|  that ended the  |Sixth_Crusade|Sixth_Crusade| .  In 1244, Jerusalem was sacked by the  |Khwarezmian|Khwarazmian_Dynasty| |_Tatars|Tatars|  who decimated the citys Christian population, drove out the Jews and razed the walls, rendering the city defenseless once again. Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 25. The Khwarezmian Tatars were driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247. In 1258, the  |Mongols_destroyed_Baghdad|Siege_Of_Baghdad| , killing hundreds of thousands. For the next 30 years, the area was the  |frontier_between_Mongol_invaders|Mongol_Raids_Into_Palestine|   and the  |Mamluks|Mamluk_Sultanate|  of Egypt. The conflict impoverished the country and severely reduced the population. Sultan  |Qutuz|Qutuz|  of Egypt eventually defeated the Mongols in the  |Battle_of_Ain_Jalut|Battle_Of_Ain_Jalut|  , ending the Mongol advances, and his successors eliminated the Crusader states. The last Crusader state, the  |Kingdom_of_Acre|Kingdom_Of_Acre| , fell in 1291, ending the Crusades.                The  |Mamluks|Mamluk|  ruled Palestine until 1516, regarding it as part of  |Syria|Bilad_A_Sham| .

The Mamluks, continuing the policy of the Ayyubids, made the strategic decision to destroy the coastal area and to bring desolation to many of its cities, from  |Tyre|Tyre_Lebanon|  in the north to Gaza in the south.  |Ports|Sea_Port|  were destroyed and various materials were dumped to make them inoperable. The goal was to prevent attacks from the sea, given the fear of the return of the Crusaders. This had a long-term effect on those areas, which remained sparsely populated for centuries. The activity in that time concentrated more inland.

In return for a large payment, about 100,000 Spanish Jews were allowed into Portugal, however five years later, their children were seized and they were given the choice of conversion or departing without them. The Jews of Spain by Jane Gerber, Free Press 1994 pp 142 - 144 Most converted but continued to practice in secret. The economic success of the converts in Spain and Portugal and suspicion of their sincerity led to laws restricting the rights of Christians of Jewish origin. Escaping Jews were often maltreated by those shipping them and refused entry to various ports around the Mediterranean by communities afraid of being swamped. Expulsions also took place in Italy, affecting survivors of the original expulsion.     Many secret Jews chose to move to the New World, where they were temporarily able to practice Judaism freely . Other  |Spanish_Jews|Sephardi_Jews|  moved to North Africa,  |Poland|History_Of_The_Jews_In_Poland|  and the Ottoman Empire, especially  |Thessaloniki|History_Of_The_Jews_In_Thessaloniki|  which became the worlds largest Jewish city. Some headed for Israel, which was also controlled by the Ottomans. In Italy, Jews living in Venice were required to live in a  |ghetto|Ghetto| , a practice which spread to the papal states  and was adopted across Catholic Europe. Jews outside the Ghetto often had to wear a yellow star. Secretly practicing Jews could not revert to Judaism inside Europe as this carried a death sentence. The last compulsory Ghetto was administered by the Vatican  |in_Rome|Roman_Ghetto|  and abolished in the 1880s.     In 1523,  |David_Reubeni|David_Reubeni|  tried to persuade  |Emperor_Charles_V|Emperor_Charles_V|  to participate in a plan to raise a Jewish army to conquer Judea and setup a Jewish kingdom, using Jewish warriors from India and Ethiopia.

In 1844, Jews constituted the largest population group in Jerusalem. By 1896 Jews constituted an absolute majority in Jerusalem, Shlomo Slonim,   |Martinus_Nijhoff_Publishers|Martinus_Nijhoff_Publishers|  1999  p.13 but the overall population in Palestine was 88% Muslim and 9% Christian.  |Gudrun_Krämer|Gudrun_Krämer| ,   |Princeton_University_Press|Princeton_University_Press|  2011  p.137               During the 19th century, Jews in Western Europe were increasingly granted citizenship and  |equality_before_the_law|Jewish_Emancipation| ; however, in Eastern Europe, they faced growing  |persecution_and_legal_restrictions|History_Of_Zionismpersecution_In_Russia| , including widespread  |pogroms|Pogrom|  in which thousands were murdered, raped or lost their property. Half the worlds Jews lived in the Russian Empire, where they were severely persecuted and restricted to living in the  |Pale_of_Settlement|Pale_Of_Settlement| . National groups in the Empire, such as the Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainians were agitating for independence and often regarded the Jews as undesirable aliens. The Jews were usually the only non-Christian minority and spoke a distinct language . An independent Jewish national movement first began to emerge in the Russian Empire and the millions of Jews who were fleeing the country carried the seeds of this nationalism wherever they went.     In 1870, an agricultural school, the  |Mikveh_Israel|Mikveh_Israel| , was founded near  |Jaffa|Jaffa|  by the  |Alliance_Israelite_Universelle|Alliance_Israelite_Universelle| , a French Jewish association. In 1878, Russian Jewish emigrants established the village of  |Petah_Tikva|Petah_Tikva| , followed by  |Rishon_LeZion|Rishon_Lezion|  in 1882. Russian Jews established the  |Bilu|Bilu|  and  |Hovevei_Zion|Hovevei_Zion|  movements to assist settlers and these created communities that, unlike the traditional Ashkenazi-Jewish communities, sought to be self-reliant rather than dependent on donations from abroad. Existing Ashkenazi-Jewish communities were concentrated in the  |Four_Holy_Cities|Four_Holy_Cities| , extremely poor and lived on donations from Europe. The new migrants created small agricultural settlements. In Jaffa a vibrant commercial community developed in which Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews inter-mingled. Many early migrants left due to difficulty finding work and the early settlements often remained dependent on foreign donations. Despite the difficulties, more settlements arose and the community grew.     The new migration was accompanied by a  |revival_of_the_Hebrew_language|Revival_Of_The_Hebrew_Language|  and attracted Jews of all kinds; religious, secular, nationalists and  |left_wing_socialists|Labor_Zionism| . Socialists aimed to reclaim the land by becoming peasants or workers and forming  |collectives|Kibbutz| . In Zionist history, the different waves of Jewish settlement are known as  |aliyah|Aliyah|  . During the  |First_Aliyah|First_Aliyah| , between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews moved to what is now Israel. The first wave coincided with a wave of Jewish migration and  |Messianism|Messianism|  among  |Yemenite_Jews|Yemenite_Jews|  and  |Bukharan_Jews|Bukharan_Jews| . By 1890, Jews were a majority in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| , although the country as a whole was populated mainly by Muslim and Christian Arabs.     In 1896  |Theodor_Herzl|Theodor_Herzl|  published  Der Judenstaat  , in which he asserted that the solution to growing  |antisemitism|Antisemitism|  in Europe  was to establish a Jewish state. In 1897, the  |Zionist_Organisation|Zionist_Organisation|  was founded and the  |First_Zionist_Congress|First_Zionist_Congress|  proclaimed its aim to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law.  However, Zionism was regarded with suspicion by the Ottoman rulers and was unable to make major progress.     Between 1904 and 1914, around 40,000 Jews settled in the area now known as Israel . In 1908 the Zionist Organisation set up the Palestine Bureau in Jaffa and began to adopt a systematic Jewish settlement policy. Migrants were mainly from Russia , escaping persecution. The first  |Kibbutz|Kibbutz| ,  |Degania|Degania_Alef| , was founded by nine Russian socialists in 1909. In 1909 residents of Jaffa established the first entirely Hebrew-speaking city,  |Ahuzat_Bayit|Ahuzat_Bayit|  . Hebrew newspapers and books were published,  |Hebrew_schools|Herzliya_Hebrew_Gymnasium| , Jewish political parties and workers organizations were established.             During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , most Jews supported the Germans because they were fighting the Russians who were regarded as the Jews main enemy. Weizmann, the Making of a Statesman by  |Jehuda_Reinharz|Jehuda_Reinharz| , Oxford 1993, chapters 3 & 4 In Britain, the government sought Jewish support for the war effort for a variety of reasons including an erroneous antisemitic perception of Jewish power over the Ottoman Empires  |Young_Turks|Young_Turks|  movement,  |David_Fromkin|David_Fromkin| ,  A Peace to End All Peace , part VI pp. 253–305 and a desire to secure American Jewish support for US intervention on Britains behalf.

The letter subsequently became known as the  |Balfour_Declaration_of_1917|Balfour_Declaration_Of_1917| . It stated that the British Government view with favour the establishment in  |Palestine|Palestine|  of a national home for the Jewish people . The declaration provided the British government with a pretext for claiming and governing the country. A Line in the Sand: Britain, France and the Struggle That Shaped the Middle East by James Barr, Simon & Schuster 2011, pages 375–376. New Middle Eastern boundaries were decided  |by_an_agreement|Sykes–Picot_Agreement|  between British and French bureaucrats. The agreement gave Britain control over what parties would begin to call Palestine .     A  |Jewish_Legion|Jewish_Legion|  composed largely of Zionist volunteers organized by  |Zeev_Jabotinsky|Zeev_Jabotinsky|  and  |Joseph_Trumpeldor|Joseph_Trumpeldor|  participated in the British invasion.

The  |British_Mandate|British_Mandate_For_Palestine|  of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  in 1922 and came into effect in 1923. The boundaries of Palestine initially included modern  |Jordan|Jordan| , which was  |removed|Emirate_Of_Transjordan|  from the territory by  |Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  a few years later. Britain signed a treaty with the United States in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate.     Between 1919 and 1923, another 40,000 Jews arrived in Palestine, mainly escaping the post- |revolutionary|Russian_Revolution|  chaos of Russia , as over 100,000 Jews were massacred in this period in Ukraine, with 1.5 million affected by mass rape, beatings and destruction of property. THE POGROMS IN UKRAINE, 1918–19 by Nokhem Shtif, Introduction 2019 British troops  |assisted_the_White_Russian_forces|Allied_Intervention_In_The_Russian_Civil_War|  responsible for these massacres .  British troops in Palestine were said to be more familiar with the  |Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion|Protocols_Of_The_Elders_Of_Zion| , a Tsarist forgery alleging a Zionist plot to conquer the world, than with the Balfour declaration. Hostages of Modernization: Germany, Great Britain, France edited by Herbert Arthur Strauss, 1993 pp 390 The Protocols were soon translated into Arabic.     Many of the Jewish immigrants of this period supported the Bolsheviks and became known as  |pioneers|Wikt_Pioneer|  , experienced or trained in agriculture who established self-sustaining communes called  |Kibbutz|Kibbutz| im. Malarial marshes in the  |Jezreel_Valley|Jezreel_Valley|  and  |Hefer_Plain|Hefer_Plain|  were drained and converted to agricultural use. Land was bought by the  |Jewish_National_Fund|Jewish_National_Fund| , a Zionist charity that collected money abroad for that purpose. A mainly socialist underground Jewish militia,  |Haganah|Haganah|  , was established to defend outlying Jewish settlements.        The French  |victory|Franco_Syrian_War|  over the  |Arab_Kingdom_of_Syria|Arab_Kingdom_Of_Syria|  and the Balfour Declaration led to the emergence of  |Palestinian_Nationalism|Palestinian_Nationalism|  and Arab rioting in  |1920|1920_Nebi_Musa_Riots|  and  |1921|Jaffa_Riots| . In response, the British authorities imposed immigration quotas for Jews. Exceptions were made for Jews with over 1,000 pounds in cash or Jewish professionals with over 500 pounds. The  |Jewish_Agency|Jewish_Agency|  issued the British entry permits and distributed funds donated by Jews abroad.  |Peel_Commission|Peel_Commission| , p. 172 Between 1924 and 1929, 82,000 more Jews arrived , fleeing antisemitism in Poland and Hungary, and because the United States  |Immigration_Act_of_1924|Immigration_Act_Of_1924|  now kept Jews out. The new arrivals were mainly middle-class families who moved into towns and established small businesses and workshops—although lack of economic opportunities meant that approximately a quarter later left. The first electricity generator was built in Tel Aviv in 1923 under the guidance of  |Pinhas_Rutenberg|Pinhas_Rutenberg| , a former  |Commissar|Commissar|  of St Petersburg in Russias pre-Bolshevik  |Kerensky_Government|Kerensky_Government| . In 1925 the Jewish Agency established the  |Hebrew_University|Hebrew_University|  in Jerusalem and the  |Technion|Technion|  in Haifa. British authorities introduced the  |Palestine_pound|Palestine_Pound|  in 1927, replacing the  |Egyptian_pound|Egyptian_Pound|  as the unit of currency in the Mandate. The Roots of Separatism in Palestine: British Economic Policy, 1920–1929 by BJ Smith 1992     From 1928, the democratically elected Vaad Leumi  became the main institution of the Palestine Jewish community  and included non-Zionist Jews. As the Yishuv grew, the JNC adopted more government-type functions, such as education, health care and security. With British permission, the Vaad raised its own taxes   |Peel_Commission|Peel_Commission| , pp. 48–49 and ran independent services for the Jewish population.  |Peel_Commission|Peel_Commission| , chapters 5, 8 and 16 From 1929 its leadership was elected by Jews from 26 countries.     In 1929 tensions grew over the Kotel , a narrow alleyway where the British banned Jews from using chairs or curtains: Many of the worshippers were elderly and needed seats; they also wanted to separate women from men. The  |Mufti|Haj_Amin_Al_Husseini|  claimed it was Muslim property and deliberately had cattle driven through the alley. He alleged that the Jews were seeking control of the Temple Mount. This led to the August  |1929_Palestine_riots|1929_Palestine_Riots| . The  |main_victims|1929_Hebron_Massacre|  were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron, who were massacred. The riots led to right-wing Zionists establishing their own militia in 1931, the  |Irgun|Irgun|  Tzvai Leumi .     Zionist political parties provided private education and health care: the  |General_Zionists|General_Zionists| , the  |Mizrahi|Mizrachi|  and the  |Socialist_Zionists|Labor_Zionism| , each established independent health and education services and operated sports organizations funded by local taxes, donations and fees . During the whole interwar period, the British, appealing to the terms of the Mandate, rejected the principle of majority rule or any other measure that would give the Arab population, who formed the majority of the population, control over Palestinian territory.          In 1933, the Jewish Agency and the Nazis negotiated the  |Haavara_Agreement|Haavara_Agreement|  , under which 50,000 Jews would be transferred to Palestine. The Jews possessions were confiscated and in return the Nazis allowed the Haavara organization to purchase 14 million pounds worth of German goods for export to Palestine and use it to compensate the immigrants. Although many Jews wanted to leave Nazi Germany, the Nazis prevented Jews from taking any money and restricted them to two suitcases so few could pay the British entry tax and many were afraid to leave. The agreement was controversial and the Labour Zionist leader who negotiated the agreement,  |Haim_Arlosoroff|Haim_Arlosoroff| , was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933. The assassination was used by the British to create tension between the Zionist left and the Zionist right. Arlosoroff had been the boyfriend of  |Magda_Ritschel|Magda_Goebbels|  some years before she married  |Joseph_Goebbels|Joseph_Goebbels| .  There has been speculation that he was assassinated by the Nazis to hide the connection but there is no evidence for it.  In Palestine, Jewish immigration helped the economy to flourish. The British used the taxes paid by the Jewish population to build a port and oil refineries at Haifa and to fund their government in Transjordan. Industrialization began to change the predominantly agricultural Palestinian economy.     Between 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine . 174,000 arrived between 1933 and 1936, after which the British increasingly prevented immigration. Migrants were mainly from Germany and included professionals, doctors, lawyers and professors. German architects of the  |Bauhaus|Bauhaus|  school made Tel-Aviv the worlds only city with purely  |Bauhaus_neighbourhoods|White_City|  and Palestine had the highest per-capita percentage of doctors in the world.     Fascist regimes were emerging across Europe and persecution of Jews increased. In many countries, Jews reverted to being non-citizens deprived of civil and economic rights, subject to arbitrary persecution. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in  |Poland|Second_Polish_Republic|  , Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919–1939 By Joseph Marcus, Mouton 1983, pg 366  |Hungary|Hungary_During_World_War_Ii| ,  |Romania|Romania_In_World_War_Ii|  and the Nazi created states of  |Croatia|Independent_State_Of_Croatia|  and  |Slovakia|Slovak_Republic| , while  |Germany|Nazi_Germany|  annexed  |Austria|Anschluss|  and the  |Czech_territories|German_Occupation_Of_Czechoslovakia| .             Jewish immigration and Nazi propaganda contributed to the large-scale  |1936–1939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine|1936–1939_Arab_Revolt_In_Palestine| , a largely nationalist uprising directed at ending British rule. The head of the Jewish Agency, Ben-Gurion, responded to the Arab Revolt with a policy of  |Havlagah|Havlagah|  —self-restraint and a refusal to be provoked by Arab attacks in order to prevent polarization. The Etzel group broke off from the Haganah in opposition to this policy.     The British responded to the revolt with the  |Peel_Commission|Peel_Commission|  , a public inquiry that recommended that an exclusively Jewish territory be created in the  |Galilee|Galilee|  and western coast ; the rest becoming an exclusively Arab area. The two main Jewish leaders,  |Chaim_Weizmann|Chaim_Weizmann|  and  |David_Ben_Gurion|David_Ben_Gurion| , had convinced the  |Zionist_Congress|World_Zionist_Congress|  to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation.  Benny Morris, One state, two states:resolving the Israel/Palestine conflict, 2009, p. 66 Benny Morris, , p. 48; p. 11 while the Zionist movement, after much agonising, accepted the principle of partition and the proposals as a basis for negotiation ; p. 49 In the end, after bitter debate, the Congress equivocally approved –by a vote of 299 to 160 – the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation. The plan was rejected outright by the Palestinian Arab leadership and they renewed the revolt, which caused the British to appease the Arabs, and to abandon the plan as unworkable. For more information see Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945 by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 Chapter 3 , p. 11, The AHC renewed the revolt. Whitehall ... took vigorous steps to appease the Palestinians.     Testifying before the Peel Commission, Weizmann said There are in Europe 6,000,000 people ... for whom the world is divided into places where they cannot live and places where they cannot enter. In 1938, the US called an  |international_conference|Évian_Conference|  to address the question of the vast numbers of Jews trying to escape Europe. Britain made its attendance contingent on Palestine being kept out of the discussion.  No Jewish representatives were invited. The Nazis proposed their own solution: that the Jews of Europe be shipped to Madagascar .     With millions of Jews trying to leave Europe and every country in the world closed to Jewish migration, the British decided to close Palestine. The  |White_Paper_of_1939|White_Paper_Of_1939| , recommended that an independent Palestine, governed jointly by Arabs and Jews, be established within 10 years. The White Paper agreed to allow 75,000 Jewish immigrants into Palestine over the period 1940–44, after which migration would require Arab approval. Both the Arab and Jewish leadership rejected the White Paper. In March 1940 the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict banning Jews from purchasing land in 95% of Palestine. Jews now resorted to illegal immigration: , often organized by the  |Mossad_Lealiyah_Bet|Mossad_Lealiyah_Bet|  and the Irgun. With no outside help and no countries ready to admit them, very few Jews managed to escape Europe between 1939 and 1945. Those caught by the British were mostly  |imprisoned_in_Mauritius|History_Of_The_Jews_In_Mauritius| .                During the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , the Jewish Agency worked to establish a Jewish army that would fight alongside the British forces. Churchill supported the plan but British Military and government opposition led to its rejection. The British demanded that the number of Jewish recruits match the number of Arab recruits, Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945 by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 p. 103 but few Arabs would fight for Britain, and the Palestinian leader, the  |Mufti_of_Jerusalem|Haj_Amin_Al_Husseini| , allied with Nazi Germany.     In June 1940, Italy declared war on the British Commonwealth and sided with Germany. Within a month, Italian planes  |bombed_Tel_Aviv_and_Haifa|Italian_Bombing_Of_Mandatory_Palestine_In_World_War_Ii| , inflicting multiple casualties.  In May 1941, the  |Palmach|Palmach|  was established to defend the  |Yishuv|Yishuv|  against the planned  |Axis|Axis_Powers|  invasion through  |North_Africa|North_African_Campaign| . The British refusal to provide arms to the Jews, even when Rommels forces were  |advancing_through_Egypt|200_Days_Of_Dread|  in June 1942 and the 1939 White Paper, led to the emergence of a Zionist leadership in Palestine that believed conflict with Britain was inevitable. Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945 by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 pp. 122–130 Despite this, the Jewish Agency called on Palestines Jewish youth to volunteer for the British Army . 30,000 Palestinian Jews  and 6,000 Palestinian Arabs enlisted in the British armed forces during the war. In June 1944 the British agreed to create a  |Jewish_Brigade|Jewish_Brigade|  that would fight in Italy.     Approximately 1.5 million Jews around the world served in every branch of the allied armies, mainly in the Soviet and US armies. 200,000 Jews died serving in the Soviet army alone. .  |Yad_Vashem|Yad_Vashem| . Many of these war veterans later volunteered to fight for Israel or were active in its support.     A small group , dedicated to resisting the British administration in Palestine, broke away from the Etzel and formed the Lehi , led by  |Avraham_Stern|Avraham_Stern| . In 1943, the  |USSR|Ussr|  released the Revisionist Zionist leader  |Menachem_Begin|Menachem_Begin|  from the  |Gulag|Gulag|  and he went to Palestine, taking command of the Etzel organization with a policy of increased conflict against the British. At about the same time  |Yitzhak_Shamir|Yitzhak_Shamir|  escaped from the  |camp_in_Eritrea|Irgun_And_Lehi_Internment_In_Africa|  where the British were holding Lehi activists without trial, taking command of the Lehi .     Jews in the Middle East were also affected by the war. Most of North Africa came under Nazi control and many Jews were used as slaves.  The 1941  |pro_Axis_coup_in_Iraq|1941_Iraqi_Coup_Détat|  was accompanied by  |massacres|Farhud|  of Jews. The Jewish Agency put together plans for a last stand in the event of Rommel invading Palestine . Nazi Palestine: The Plans for the Extermination of the Jews in Palestine by Mallman and Cuppers, 2010     Between 1939 and 1945, the Nazis,  |aided_by_local_forces|Responsibility_For_The_Holocaust| , led systematic efforts to kill every person of Jewish extraction in Europe , causing the deaths of approximately 6 million Jews. A quarter of those killed were children. The Polish and German Jewish communities, which played an important role in defining the pre-1945 Jewish world, mostly ceased to exist. In the United States and Palestine, Jews of European origin became disconnected from their families and roots.  |Sepharadi|Sephardi_Jews|  and  |Mizrahi_Jews|Mizrahi_Jews| , who had been a minority, became a much more significant factor in the Jewish world. Those Jews who survived in central Europe, were  |displaced_persons|Displaced_Persons_Camp|  ; an  |Anglo_American_Committee_of_Inquiry|Anglo_American_Committee_Of_Inquiry| , established to examine the Palestine issue, surveyed their ambitions and found that over 95% wanted to migrate to Palestine.   Between National Socialism and Soviet Communism: Displaced Persons in Postwar Germany by Anna Holian Michigan 2011 pp 181–2     In the Zionist movement the moderate Pro-British Weizmann, whose son died flying in the  |RAF|Royal_Air_Force| , was undermined by Britains anti-Zionist policies. Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945 by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 pp. 125–135 Leadership of the movement passed to the Jewish Agency in Palestine, now led by the anti-British Socialist-Zionist party  and led by  |David_Ben_Gurion|David_Ben_Gurion| . In the  |diaspora|Jewish_Diaspora| , US Jews now dominated the Zionist movement.             The  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  was severely weakened by the war. In the Middle East, the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil. British firms controlled Iraqi oil and Britain ruled Kuwait, Bahrain and the Emirates. Shortly after  |VE_Day|Ve_Day| , the Labour Party won the general election in Britain. Although Labour Party conferences had for years called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour government now decided to maintain the 1939 White Paper policies.         Illegal migration  became the main form of Jewish entry into Palestine. Across Europe  |Bricha|Bricha|  , an organization of former  |partisans|Jewish_Partisans|  and  |ghetto_fighters|Jewish_Resistance_Under_Nazi_Rule| , smuggled Holocaust survivors from Eastern Europe to Mediterranean ports, where small boats tried to breach the British blockade of Palestine. Meanwhile, Jews from Arab countries began moving into Palestine overland. Despite British efforts to curb immigration, during the 14 years of the Aliyah Bet, over 110,000 Jews entered Palestine. By the end of World War II, the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33% of the total population.      In an effort to win independence, Zionists now waged a  |guerrilla_war|British–Zionist_Conflict|  against the British. The main underground Jewish militia, the Haganah, formed an alliance called the  |Jewish_Resistance_Movement|Jewish_Resistance_Movement|  with the Etzel and Stern Gang to fight the British. In June 1946, following instances of Jewish  |sabotage|Night_Of_The_Bridges| , the British launched  |Operation_Agatha|Operation_Agatha| , arresting 2700 Jews, including the leadership of the Jewish Agency, whose headquarters were raided. Those arrested were held without trial.     On 4 July 1946  |a_massive_pogrom_in_Poland|Kielce_Pogrom|  led to a wave of Holocaust survivors fleeing Europe for Palestine. Three weeks later, Irgun  |bombed_the_British_Military_Headquarters|King_David_Hotel_Bombing|  of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 people. In the days following the bombing, Tel Aviv was placed under curfew and over 120,000 Jews, nearly 20% of the Jewish population of Palestine, were questioned by the police. In the US, Congress criticized British handling of the situation and considered delaying  |loans|Anglo_American_Loan|  that were vital to British post-war recovery.      Between 1945 and 1948, 100,000–120,000 Jews left Poland. Their departure was largely organized by Zionist activists in Poland under the umbrella of the semi-clandestine organization  Berihah  .  Berihah was also responsible for the organized emigration of Jews from  |Romania|History_Of_The_Jews_In_Romaniapost_War| , Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, totalling 250,000 Holocaust survivors. The British imprisoned the Jews trying to enter Palestine in the  |Atlit_detainee_camp|Atlit_Detainee_Camp|  and  |Cyprus_internment_camps|Cyprus_Internment_Camps| . Those held were mainly Holocaust survivors, including large numbers of children and orphans. In response to Cypriot fears that the Jews would never leave and because the 75,000 quota established by the 1939 White Paper had never been filled, the British allowed the refugees to enter Palestine at a rate of 750 per month.     By 1947 the Labour Government was ready to refer the Palestine problem to the newly created United Nations.             On 2 April 1947, the United Kingdom requested that the question of Palestine be handled by the  |General_Assembly|General_Assembly_Of_The_United_Nations| .   The General Assembly created a committee,  |United_Nations_Special_Committee_on_Palestine|United_Nations_Special_Committee_On_Palestine|  , to report on the question of Palestine .   of 15 May 1947 General Assembly Resolution 106 Constituting the UNSCOP: Retrieved 30 May 2012 In July 1947 the UNSCOP visited Palestine and met with Jewish and Zionist delegations. The  |Arab_Higher_Committee|Arab_Higher_Committee|  boycotted the meetings. During the visit the British Foreign Secretary  |Ernest_Bevin|Ernest_Bevin|  ordered an illegal immigrant ship, the  Exodus 1947 , to be sent back to Europe. The migrants on the ship were forcibly removed by British troops at Hamburg.     The principal non-Zionist Orthodox Jewish  party,  |Agudat_Israel|Agudat_Israel| , recommended to UNSCOP that a Jewish state be set up after reaching a religious  |status_quo_agreement|Status_Quo|  with Ben-Gurion regarding the future Jewish state. The agreement granted an exemption from military service to a quota of  |yeshiva|Yeshiva|  students and to all orthodox women, made the Sabbath the national weekend, guaranteed  |Kosher|Kosher|  food in government institutions and allowed Orthodox Jews to maintain a separate education system.      The majority report of UNSCOP proposed   an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem , the last to be under an International Trusteeship System .  On 29 November 1947, in  |Resolution_181|Resolution_181|  , the General Assembly adopted the majority report of UNSCOP, but with slight modifications.  The Plan also called for the British to allow substantial Jewish migration by 1 February 1948. Part I paragraph 2 UN resolution 181,      Neither Britain nor the UN Security Council took any action to implement the resolution and Britain continued detaining Jews attempting to enter Palestine. Concerned that partition would severely damage Anglo-Arab relations, Britain denied UN representatives access to Palestine during the period between the adoption of Resolution 181 and the termination of the British Mandate.  |Trygve_Lie|Trygve_Lie| , In the Cause of Peace, Seven Years with the United Nations p. 163 The British withdrawal was finally completed in May 1948. However, Britain continued to hold Jewish immigrants of fighting age and their families on Cyprus until March 1949. Morris Laub, Last barrier to freedom: internment of Jewish holocaust survivors on Cyprus 1946–1949, Berkeley 1985             The General Assemblys vote caused joy in the Jewish community and discontent among the Arab community. Violence broke out between the sides, escalating into  |civil_war|1947–48_Civil_War_In_Mandatory_Palestine| . From January 1948, operations became increasingly militarized, with the intervention of a number of  |Arab_Liberation_Army|Arab_Liberation_Army|  regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in  |Galilee|Galilee|  and  |Samaria|Samaria| .  |Yoav_Gelber_|Gelber| , pp. 51–56  |Abd_al_Qadir_al_Husayni|Abd_Al_Qadir_Al_Husayni|  came from Egypt with several hundred men of the  |Army_of_the_Holy_War|Army_Of_The_Holy_War| .

By March, almost all  |Haganahs|Haganah|  armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.  |Benny_Morris_|Morris_Birth| , p. 163     Up to 100,000 Arabs, from the urban upper and middle classes in Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, or Jewish-dominated areas, evacuated abroad or to Arab centres eastwards.  |Benny_Morris_|Morris_Birth| , p. 67 This situation caused the US to withdraw their support for the Partition plan, thus encouraging the  |Arab_League|Arab_League|  to believe that the Palestinian Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could put an end to the plan for partition. The British, on the other hand, decided on 7 February 1948 to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by  |Transjordan|Jordan| .  |Henry_Laurens_|Laurens| , p. 83         |David_Ben_Gurion|David_Ben_Gurion|  reorganized Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training. Thanks to funds raised by  |Golda_Meir|Golda_Meir|  from sympathisers in the United States, and Stalins decision to support the  |Zionist|Zionism|  cause, the Jewish representatives of Palestine were able to purchase important arms in Eastern Europe.     Ben-Gurion gave  |Yigael_Yadin|Yigael_Yadin|  the responsibility to plan for the announced intervention of the Arab states. The result of his analysis was  |Plan_Dalet|Plan_Dalet| , in which Haganah passed from the defensive to the offensive.

On 14 May 1948, on the day the last British forces left from Haifa, the  |Jewish_Peoples_Council|Jewish_Peoples_Council|  gathered at the  |Tel_Aviv_Museum|Tel_Aviv_Museum|  and proclaimed  |the_establishment|Declaration_Of_Establishment_Of_State_Of_Israel|  of a  |Jewish_state|Jewish_State|  in  |Eretz_Israel|Eretz_Israel| , to be known as the  |State_of_Israel|State_Of_Israel| .

The  |Arab_League|Arab_League|  members Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq refused to accept the UN partition plan and proclaimed the right of self-determination for the Arabs across the whole of Palestine. The Arab states marched their forces into what had, until the previous day, been the British Mandate for Palestine, starting the  |first_Arab–Israeli_War|1948_Arab–Israeli_War| . The Arab states had heavy military equipment at their disposal and were initially on the offensive .

When they refused to hand the arms to the government, Ben-Gurion ordered that the ship be sunk. Several Etzel members were killed in the fighting.     Large numbers of Jewish immigrants, many of them World War II veterans and Holocaust survivors, now began arriving in the new state of Israel, and many joined the IDF.      After an initial loss of territory by the Jewish state and its occupation by the Arab armies, from July the tide gradually turned in the Israelis favour and they pushed the Arab armies out and conquered some of the territory that had been included in the proposed Arab state. At the end of November, tenuous local ceasefires were arranged between the Israelis, Syrians and Lebanese. On 1 December  |King_Abdullah|Abdullah_I_Of_Jordan|  announced the union of Transjordan with Arab Palestine west of the Jordan; only Britain recognized the annexation.
