     Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome  is a rare  |autoimmune|Autoimmune|  disorder characterized by  |muscle_weakness|Weakness|  of the limbs.       Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying  |malignancy|Cancer| , most commonly  |small_cell_lung_cancer|Small_Cell_Carcinoma| ; it is therefore regarded as a  |paraneoplastic_syndrome|Paraneoplastic_Syndrome|  . It is the result of  |antibodies|Antibody|  against presynaptic  |voltage_gated_calcium_channels|Voltage_Dependent_Calcium_Channel| , and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the  |neuromuscular_junction|Neuromuscular_Junction|  . The diagnosis is usually confirmed with  |electromyography|Electromyography|  and  |blood_tests|Blood_Test| ; these also distinguish it from  |myasthenia_gravis|Myasthenia_Gravis| , a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.       If the disease is associated with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are  |steroids|Glucocorticoid| ,  |azathioprine|Azathioprine| , which suppress the immune system,  |intravenous_immunoglobulin|Intravenous_Immunoglobulin| , which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and  |pyridostigmine|Pyridostigmine|  and  |3_4_diaminopyridine|3_4_Diaminopyridine| , which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally,  |plasma_exchange|Plasmapheresis|  is required to remove the antibodies.       The condition affects about 3.4 per million people.  LEMS usually occurs in people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age.       The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs . In contrast to  |myasthenia_gravis|Myasthenia_Gravis| , the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or  |physical_exercise|Physical_Exercise| . High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the  |bulbar_muscles|Corticobulbar_Tract|  is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the  |eye_muscles|Muscles_Of_Orbit|  is uncommon. Some may have  |double_vision|Diplopia| ,  |drooping_of_the_eyelids|Ptosis|  and  |difficulty_swallowing|Dysphagia| , but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common.  In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the  |respiratory_muscles|Muscles_Of_Respiration|  may occur.  Some may also experience problems with  |coordination|Motor_Coordination|  .      Three-quarters of people with LEMS also have disruption of the  |autonomic_nervous_system|Autonomic_Nervous_System| . This may be experienced as a  |dry_mouth|Xerostomia| ,  |constipation|Constipation| ,  |blurred_vision|Blurred_Vision| , impaired  |sweating|Perspiration| , and  |orthostatic_hypotension|Orthostatic_Hypotension|  . Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.     On  |neurological_examination|Neurological_Examination| , the weakness demonstrated with normal testing of power is often less severe than would be expected on the basis of the symptoms. Strength improves further with repeated testing, e.g. improvement of power on repeated hand grip . At rest,  |reflex|Reflex| es are typically reduced; with muscle use, reflex strength increases. This is a characteristic feature of LEMS. The  |pupillary_light_reflex|Pupillary_Light_Reflex|  may be sluggish.     In LEMS associated with lung cancer, most have no suggestive symptoms of cancer at the time, such as  |cough|Cough| ,  |coughing_blood|Hemoptysis| , and  |unintentional_weight_loss|Weight_Lossunintentional_Weight_Loss| . LEMS associated with lung cancer may be more severe.       LEMS is often associated with lung cancer , specifically  |small_cell_carcinoma|Small_Cell_Carcinoma| , making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of the people with small-cell lung cancer, 1–3% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the lung cancer, and it is otherwise  |asymptomatic|Asymptomatic| .     LEMS may also be associated with  |autoimmune_diseases|Autoimmune_Disease| , such as  |hypothyroidism|Hypothyroidism|   or  |diabetes_mellitus_type_1|Diabetes_Mellitus_Type_1| . Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen in the presence of tumors ; people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases.  |HLA_DR3|Hla_Dr3| - |B8|Hla_B8|  , in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.       In normal neuromuscular function, a  |nerve_impulse|Action_Potential|  is carried down the  |axon|Axon|   from the  |spinal_cord|Spinal_Cord| . At the nerve ending in the  |neuromuscular_junction|Neuromuscular_Junction| , where the impulse is transferred to the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads to the opening of  |voltage_gated_calcium_channels|Voltage_Gated_Calcium_Channels|  , the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain  |acetylcholine|Acetylcholine| , which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the  |acetylcholine_receptors|Acetylcholine_Receptor|  on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.     In LEMS, antibodies against VGCC, particularly the  |P|P_Type_Calcium_Channel| / |Q_type|Q_Type_Calcium_Channel|  VGCC, decrease the amount of calcium that can enter the nerve ending, hence less acetylcholine can be released from the neuromuscular junction. Apart from  |skeletal_muscle|Skeletal_Muscle| , the autonomic nervous system also requires acetylcholine neurotransmission; this explains the occurrence of autonomic symptoms in LEMS. P/Q voltage-gated calcium channels are also found in the  |cerebellum|Cerebellum| , explaining why some experience problems with coordination. The antibodies bind particularly to the part of the receptor known as the domain III S5–S6 linker peptide . Antibodies may also bind other VGCCs. Some have antibodies that bind  |synaptotagmin|Synaptotagmin| , the protein sensor for calcium-regulated vesicle fusion. Many people with LEMS, both with and without VGCC antibodies, have detectable antibodies against the  |M1_subtype_of_the_acetylcholine_receptor|Muscarinic_Acetylcholine_Receptor_M1| ; their presence may participate in a lack of compensation for the weak calcium influx.     Apart from the decreased calcium influx, a disruption of active zone vesicle release sites also occurs, which may also be antibody-dependent, since people with LEMS have antibodies to components of these active zones . Together, these abnormalities lead to the decrease in muscle contractility. Repeated stimuli over a period of about 10 seconds eventually lead to sufficient delivery of calcium, and an increase in muscle contraction to normal levels, which can be demonstrated using an  |electrodiagnostic_medicine|Electrodiagnostic_Medicine|  study called needle electromyography by increasing amplitude of repeated  |compound_muscle_action_potentials|Compound_Muscle_Action_Potential| .     The antibodies found in LEMS associated with lung cancer also bind to calcium channels in the cancer cells, and it is presumed that the antibodies originally develop as a reaction to these cells. It has been suggested that the immune reaction to the cancer cells suppresses their growth and improves the prognosis from the cancer.             The diagnosis is usually made with nerve conduction study and  |electromyography|Electromyography|  , which is one of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. EMG involves the insertion of small needles into the muscles. NCS involves administering small electrical impulses to the nerves, on the surface of the skin, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. NCS investigation in LEMS primarily involves evaluation of compound motor action potentials of effected muscles and sometimes EMG single-fiber examination can be used.     CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and conduction velocities. If repeated impulses are administered , it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the motor end plate is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all can be attributed to insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly . This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli . This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter and blocking.     Blood tests may be performed to exclude other causes of muscle disease . Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels can be identified in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a  |CT_scan|X_Ray_Computed_Tomography|  of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months for the first two years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a  |positron_emission_tomography|Positron_Emission_Tomography|  scan of the body may also be performed to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.           If LEMS is caused by an underlying cancer, treatment of the cancer usually leads to resolution of the symptoms. Treatment usually consists of  |chemotherapy|Chemotherapy| , with  |radiation_therapy|Radiation_Therapy|  in those with limited disease.       Some evidence supports the use of  |intravenous_immunoglobulin|Intravenous_Immunoglobulin|  .  Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used with a degree of effectiveness. Plasma exchange , the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.       Three other treatment modalities also aim at improving LEMS symptoms, namely  |pyridostigmine|Pyridostigmine| ,  |3_4_diaminopyridine|3_4_Diaminopyridine|  , and  |guanidine|Guanidine| . They work to improve neuromuscular transmission.     Tentative evidence supports 3,4-diaminopyridine at least for a few weeks. The 3,4-diaminopyridine base or the water-soluble 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate may be used.  Both 3,4-diaminopyridine formulations delay the repolarization of nerve terminals after a discharge, thereby allowing more calcium to accumulate in the nerve terminal.     Pyridostigmine decreases the degradation of acetylcholine after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side effects and is not recommended.  |4_Aminopyridine|4_Aminopyridine|  , an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.       Anderson and colleagues from  |St_Thomas_Hospital|St_Thomas_Hospital| , London, were the first to mention a case with possible clinical findings of LEMS in 1953,  but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the  |Mayo_Clinic|Mayo_Clinic|  were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956.   In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity.  Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.
