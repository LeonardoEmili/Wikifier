|Switzerland|Switzerland|  is a  |semi-direct|Semi-Direct_Democracy| |democratic|Democracy| |federal|Federal_Republic| |republic|Republic| . The federal  |legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in the two chambers of the  |Federal_Assembly|Federal_Assembly| , the  |National_Council|National_Council|  and the  |Council_of_States|Council_Of_States| . The  |Federal_Council|Swiss_Federal_Council|  holds the executive power and is composed of seven power-sharing Federal Councillors elected by the Federal Assembly. The  |judicial|Judiciary|  branch is headed by the  |Federal_Supreme_Court_of_Switzerland|Federal_Supreme_Court_Of_Switzerland| , whose judges are elected by the Federal Assembly.     Switzerland has a tradition of  |direct_democracy|Direct_Democracy| . For any change in the constitution, a  |referendum|Referendum|  is mandatory ; for any change in a  |law|Law| , a referendum can be requested . In addition, the people may present a  |constitutional_popular_initiative|Popular_Initiative|  to introduce amendments to the  |federal_constitution|Swiss_Federal_Constitution| . The people also assume a role similar to the constitutional court, which does not exist, and thus act as the guardian of the rule of law.     Cantonal and municipal politics vary in the different cantons, which may have different systems.               Switzerland features a system of government not seen in any other nation: direct representation, sometimes called half-direct democracy .   |Referenda|Referendum|  on the most important laws have been used since the  |1848_constitution|Switzerland_As_A_Federal_State| .     Amendments to the Federal Constitution of Switzerland, the joining of international organizations, or changes to federal laws that have no foundation in the constitution but will remain in force for more than one year must be approved by the majority of both the people and the  |cantons|Cantons| , a  |double_majority|Double_Majority| .     Any citizen may challenge a law that has been passed by parliament. If that person is able to gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days, a national vote has to be scheduled where voters decide by a  |simple_majority|Majority|  of the voters whether to accept or reject the law. Pierre Cormon, Swiss Politics for Complete Beginners, Editions Slatkine, 2014,      Also, any citizen may seek a decision on an  |amendment|Constitutional_Amendment|  they want to make to the constitution. For such a  |federal_popular_initiative|Federal_Popular_Initiative|  to be organised, the signatures of 100,000 voters must be collected within 18 months. Such a  |federal_popular_initiative|Federal_Popular_Initiative|  is formulated as a precise new text  whose wording can no longer be changed by  |parliament|Parliament|  and the government. After a successful signature gathering, the federal council may create a counterproposal to the proposed amendment and put it to vote on the same day as the original proposal. Such counter-proposals are usually a compromise between the  |status_quo|Status_Quo|  and the wording of the initiative. Voters will decide in a national vote whether to accept the initiative amendment, the counter proposal put forward by the government if any, or both. If both are accepted, one has to additionally signal a preference. Initiatives have to be accepted by a  |double_majority|Double_Majority|  of both the popular votes and a majority of the cantons, while counter-proposals may be of legislative level and hence require only  |simple_majority|Majority| .       Federalism refers to a vertical separation of powers. The aim is to avoid the concentration of power in a forum, which allows a moderation of state power and the easing of the duties of the federal state.     In Switzerland, it is above all a matter of designating the independence of the cantons vis-à-vis the Confederation.             The  |Swiss_Federal_Council|Swiss_Federal_Council|  is a seven-member executive council that heads the  |federal_administration|Federal_Administration_Of_Switzerland| , operating as a combination  |cabinet|Cabinet|  and  |collective_presidency|President| . Any Swiss citizen eligible to be a member of the  |National_Council|National_Council_Of_Switzerland|  can be elected;  |Swiss_Federal_Constitution|Swiss_Federal_Constitution| , art. 175 al. 3 candidates do not have to register for the election, or to actually be members of the National Council. The Federal Council is elected by the Federal Assembly for a four-year term. Present members are:  |Viola_Amherd|Viola_Amherd|  ,  |Guy_Parmelin|Guy_Parmelin|  ,  |Ueli_Maurer|Ueli_Maurer|  ,  |Ignazio_Cassis|Ignazio_Cassis|  ,  |Simonetta_Sommaruga|Simonetta_Sommaruga|  ,  |Karin_Keller-Sutter|Karin_Keller-Sutter|  and  |Alain_Berset|Alain_Berset|  .     The largely ceremonial  |President|President_Of_The_Swiss_Confederation|  and Vice President of the Confederation are elected by the Federal Assembly from among the members of the Federal Council for one-year terms that run concurrently. The President has almost no powers over and above his or her six colleagues, but undertakes representative functions normally performed by a president or prime minister in single-executive systems. The current  President and Vice President are  |Ueli_Maurer|Ueli_Maurer|  and  |Simonetta_Sommaruga|Simonetta_Sommaruga| , respectively.     The Swiss executive is one of the most stable governments worldwide. Since 1848, it has never been renewed entirely at the same time, providing a long-term continuity. From 1959 to 2003 the Federal Council was composed of a coalition of all major parties in the same ratio: two each from the  |Free_Democratic_Party|Free_Democratic_Party_Of_Switzerland| ,  |Social_Democratic_Party|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Switzerland| , and  |Christian_Democratic_Peoples_Party|Christian_Democratic_Peoples_Party_Of_Switzerland|  and one from the  |Swiss_Peoples_Party|Swiss_Peoples_Party| . Changes in the council occur typically only if one of the members resigns ; this member is almost always replaced by someone from the same party .     The Federal Chancellor is the head of the Federal Chancellery, which acts as the general staff of the Federal Council. The Chancellery is divided into three distinct sectors. The Chancellor is the formal head of the Federal Chancellor Sector, comprising the planning and strategy section, the Internal Services section, the political rights section, the federal crisis management training unit of the Federal Administration, and the Records and Process Management section.     Two sectors are headed by the Vice-Chancellors: the Federal Council sector manages the agenda of the Federal Councils meeting. This sector comprises the Section for Federal Council Affairs, the Legal Section, the Official Publications Centre and the Central Language Services. The Information & Communications Sector is led by Vice-Chancellor André Simonazzi, this role also has expanded to become the official spokesman for the Federal Council in 2000. This sector includes the e-Government Section, the Communication Support Section and the Political Forum of the Confederation.     The Swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959, each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament. The classic distribution of 2 CVP/PDC, 2 SPS/PSS, 2 FDP/PRD and 1 SVP/UDC as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the  |magic_formula|Magic_Formula|  .     This magic formula has been repeatedly criticised: in the 1960s, for excluding leftist opposition parties; in the 1980s, for excluding the emerging Green party; and particularly after the 1999 election, by the Peoples Party, which had by then grown from being the fourth largest party on the National Council to being the largest. In the  |elections_of_2003|2003_Swiss_Federal_Election| , the Peoples Party received a second seat in the Federal Council, reducing the share of the Christian Democratic Party to one seat.            Switzerland has a  |bicameral|Bicameral| |parliament|Parliament|  called the  |Federal_Assembly|Federal_Assembly_Of_Switzerland| , which is composed by:   the  |Council_of_States|Swiss_Council_Of_States|  , also known as the upper chamber   the  |National_Council|National_Council_Of_Switzerland|  , also known as the lower chamber   The Federal Assembly convenes to elect the members of the Federal Council.   The two chambers are equal . This power-sharing system serves to avoid monopolization of federal politics by more populated cantons to the detriment of smaller and rural cantons.     Members of both houses serve for 4 years and only serve as members of parliament part-time .              Switzerland has a rich party landscape. The five parties represented in the Federal Council are generally called the government parties:  |Free_Democratic_Party|Free_Democratic_Party_Of_Switzerland| ,  |Social_Democratic_Party|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Switzerland| ,  |Christian_Democratic_Party|Christian_Democratic_Peoples_Party_Of_Switzerland| ,  |Swiss_Peoples_Party|Swiss_Peoples_Party| , and  |Conservative_Democratic_Party_of_Switzerland|Conservative_Democratic_Party_Of_Switzerland| .     As of 2011 only the five government parties were represented in the Council of States. In the National Council the party landscape is more diverse with six non-government parties having at least one seat.                Switzerland has a  |Federal_Supreme_Court|Federal_Supreme_Court_Of_Switzerland| , with judges elected for six-year terms by the Federal Assembly. The function of the  |Federal_Supreme_Court|Federal_Supreme_Court_Of_Switzerland|  is to hear appeals of cantonal courts or the administrative rulings of the federal administration.   Switzerland does not have a Constitutional Court, and the Supreme Court cannot comment on law put forward by the parliament. This role is assumed by the people, which acts as a guardian and can repeal any legislation or constitutional change.                            Switzerland has a stable government. Most voters support the government in its philosophy of armed neutrality underlying its foreign and defense policies. Domestic policy poses some major problems, to the point that many observers deem that the system is in crisis but the changing international environment has generated a significant reexamination of Swiss policy in key areas such as defense, neutrality, and immigration. Quadrennial national elections typically produce only marginal changes in party representation.     In recent years, Switzerland has seen a gradual shift in the party landscape. The  |right-wing|Right-Wing_Politics| |Swiss_Peoples_Party|Swiss_Peoples_Party|  , traditionally the junior partner in the four-party  |coalition_government|Coalition_Government| , more than doubled its voting share from 11.0% in 1987 to 22.5% in 1999, rising to 28.9% in 2007, thus overtaking its three coalition partners. This shift in voting shares put a strain on the  |magic_formula|Magic_Formula|  , the power-broking agreement of the four coalition parties. From 1959 until 2004, the seven-seat cabinet had comprised 2 Free Democrats, 2 Christian Democrats, 2 Social Democrats, and 1 Swiss Peoples Party, but in 2004, the Swiss Peoples Party took one seat from the Christian Democrats. In 2008 the  |Conservative_Democratic_Party|Conservative_Democratic_Party_Of_Switzerland|  split from the SVP, taking both of their Federal Council seats with them. However, the SVP eventually retook both seats, in 2009 and 2015 respectively.      The  |Swiss_Federal_Constitution|Swiss_Federal_Constitution|  limits federal influence in the formulation of  |domestic_policy|Domestic_Policy|  and emphasizes the roles of  |private_enterprise|Private_Enterprise|  and  |cantonal_government|Cantons_Of_Switzerland| . However, in more recent times the powers of the Confederation have increased with regard to  |education|Education| ,  |agriculture|Agriculture| ,  |health|Health| ,  |energy|Energy| , the  |environment|Environment| ,  |organized_crime|Organized_Crime| , and  |narcotics|Narcotics| .     The  |Index_of_perception_of_corruption|Index_Of_Perception_Of_Corruption|  puts Switzerland among the least  |corrupt|Political_Corruption|  nations. In the 2005 survey, Switzerland ranks 7th , with 9.1 out of 10 possible points, representing an improvement of 0.4 points over the past four years.     Together with seven other European nations, Switzerland leads the 2005 index on  |Freedom_of_the_Press|Freedom_Of_The_Press|  published by  |Reporters_Without_Borders|Reporters_Without_Borders|  .          Switzerland has avoided alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action. In June 2001, Swiss voters approved new legislation providing for the deployment of armed Swiss troops for international peacekeeping missions under  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  or  |Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe|Organization_For_Security_And_Co-Operation_In_Europe|  auspices as well as international cooperation in military training. The Swiss have broadened the scope of activities in which they feel able to participate without compromising their neutrality.     Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as a  |neutral|Neutral_Country|  intermediary and host to major international treaty conferences. The country has no major disputes in its bilateral relations.               The  |energy|Energy|  generated in Switzerland comprises 55.2%  |hydroelectricity|Hydroelectricity| , 39.9% from  |nuclear_power|Nuclear_Power| , about 4% from conventional sources and about 1% other.     On May 18, 2003, two  |referenda|Referenda|  regarding the future of nuclear power in Switzerland were held. The referendum Electricity Without Nuclear asked for a decision on a  |nuclear_power_phase-out|Nuclear_Power_Phase-Out|  and Moratorium Plus asked about an extension of an existing law forbidding the building of new  |nuclear_power_plants|Nuclear_Power_Plants| . Both were turned down: Moratorium Plus by a margin of 41.6% for and 58.4% opposed, and Electricity Without Nuclear by a margin of 33.7% for and 66.3% opposed. The former ten-year  |moratorium|Moratorium|  on the construction of new nuclear power plants was the result of a  |federal_popular_initiative|Federal_Popular_Initiative|  voted on in 1990 which had passed with 54.5% Yes vs. 45.5% No votes .     In May 2011, due to the  |Fukushima_accident|Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Disaster|  in Japan, the Swiss government decided to abandon plans to build new nuclear reactors. The country’s five existing reactors will be allowed to continue operating, but will not be replaced at the end of their life span. The last will go offline in 2034.
