     Magnetic resonance imaging  is a  |medical_imaging|Medical_Imaging|  technique used in  |radiology|Radiology|  to form pictures of the  |anatomy|Anatomy|  and the physiological processes of the body.  |MRI_scanners|Physics_Of_Magnetic_Resonance_Imagingmri_Scanner|  use strong  |magnetic_fields|Magnetic_Field| , magnetic field gradients, and  |radio_waves|Radio_Wave|  to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve  |X-rays|X-Rays|  or the use of  |ionizing_radiation|Ionizing_Radiation| , which distinguishes it from  |CT_or_CAT_scans|Ct_Scan|  and  |PET_scans|Pet_Scans| . Magnetic resonance imaging is a  |medical_application|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonancemedicine|  of  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance|  . NMR can also be used for imaging in other  |NMR_applications|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonanceapplications|  such as  |NMR_spectroscopy|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy| .     While the hazards of X-rays are now well controlled in most medical contexts, an MRI scan may still be seen as a better choice than a  |CT_scan|Ct_Scan| . MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for  |medical_diagnosis|Medical_Diagnosis| ,  |staging|Cancer_Staging|  of disease and follow-up without exposing the body to  |radiation|Ionizing_Radiation| . An MRI may yield different information compared with CT. Risks and discomfort may be associated with MRI scans. Compared with CT scans, MRI scans typically take longer and are louder, and they usually need the subject to enter a narrow, confining tube. In addition, people with some medical implants or other non-removable metal inside the body may be unable to undergo an MRI examination safely.     MRI was originally called NMRI , but nuclear was dropped to avoid negative associations.  Certain  |atomic_nuclei|Atomic_Nucleus|  are able to absorb and emit  |radio_frequency|Radio_Frequency|  energy when placed in an external  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field| . In clinical and research MRI,  |hydrogen_atoms|Hydrogen|  are most often used to generate a detectable radio-frequency signal that is received by antennas close to the anatomy being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in people and other biological organisms, particularly in  |water|Properties_Of_Water|  and  |fat|Lipid| . For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the  |nuclear_spin|Spin|  energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the signal in space. By varying the parameters of the  |pulse_sequence|Pulse_Sequence| , different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the  |relaxation|Relaxation|  properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.     Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in  |diagnostic_medicine|Medical_Diagnosis|  and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects. MRI scans are capable of producing a variety of  |chemical|Diffusion_Mri|  and  |physical|Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging|  data, in addition to detailed spatial images. The sustained increase in demand for MRI within  |health_systems|Health_System|  has led to concerns about  |cost_effectiveness|Cost-Effectiveness_Analysis|  and  |overdiagnosis|Overdiagnosis| .                 In most medical applications,  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  nuclei, which consist solely of a  |proton|Proton| , that are in tissues create a signal that is processed to form an image of the body in terms of the density of those nuclei in a specific region. Given that the protons are affected by fields from other atoms to which they are bonded, it is possible to separate responses from hydrogen in specific compounds.   To perform a study, the person is positioned within an  |MRI_scanner|Physics_Of_Magnetic_Resonance_Imagingmri_Scanner|  that forms a strong  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field|  around the area to be imaged. First, energy from an  |oscillating|Oscillation|  magnetic field is temporarily applied to the patient at the appropriate  |resonance|Resonance|  frequency. Scanning with X and Y gradient coils cause a selected region of the patient to experience the exact magnetic field required for the energy to be absorbed. The  |excited|Excited_State|  atoms emit a  |radio_frequency|Radio_Frequency|  signal, which is measured by a  |receiving_coil|Radiofrequency_Coil| . The RF signal may be processed to deduce position information by looking at the changes in RF level and phase caused by varying the local magnetic field using  |gradient_coils|Physics_Of_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaginggradients| . As these coils are rapidly switched during the excitation and response to perform a moving line scan, they create the characteristic repetitive noise of an MRI scan as the windings move slightly due to magnetostriction. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the  |equilibrium_state|Thermodynamic_Equilibrium| .  |Exogenous|Exogeny| |contrast_agents|Contrast_Agent|  may be given to the person to make the image clearer.      The major components of an MRI scanner are the main  |magnet|Magnet| , which polarizes the sample, the  |shim_coils|Shim|  for correcting shifts in the  |homogeneity|Homogeneity|  of the main magnetic field, the gradient system which is used to localize the region to be scanned and the RF system, which excites the sample and detects the resulting NMR signal. The whole system is controlled by one or more computers.     MRI requires a magnetic field that is both strong and  |uniform|Homogeneity|  to a few parts per million across the scan volume. The field strength of the magnet is measured in  |teslas|Tesla|  â€“ and while the majority of systems operate at 1.5 T, commercial systems are available between 0.2 and 7 T. Most clinical magnets are  |superconducting|Superconductivity|  magnets, which require  |liquid_helium|Liquid_Helium| . Lower field strengths can be achieved with permanent magnets, which are often used in open MRI scanners for  |claustrophobic|Claustrophobia|  patients.  Recently, MRI has been demonstrated also at ultra-low fields, i.e., in the microtesla-to-millitesla range, where sufficient signal quality is made possible by prepolarization and by measuring the Larmor precession fields at about 100 microtesla with highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices .                     Each tissue returns to its equilibrium state after excitation by the independent relaxation processes of T1  and T2 .      To create a T1-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to recover before measuring the MR signal by changing the  |repetition_time|Repetition_Time|  . This image weighting is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying fatty tissue, characterizing focal liver lesions, and in general obtaining morphological information, as well as for  |post-contrast|Mri_Contrast_Agent|  imaging.      To create a T2-weighted image, magnetization is allowed to decay before measuring the MR signal by changing the  |echo_time|Echo_Time|  . This image weighting is useful for detecting  |edema|Edema|  and inflammation, revealing  |white_matter_lesions|Hyperintensity| , and assessing zonal anatomy in the  |prostate|Prostate|  and  |uterus|Uterus| .     The standard display of MRI images is to represent fluid characteristics in  |black_and_white|Black_And_White|  images, where different tissues turn out as follows:                   MRI has a wide range of applications in  |medical_diagnosis|Medical_Diagnosis|  and more than 25,000 scanners are estimated to be in use worldwide.  MRI affects diagnosis and treatment in many specialties although the effect on improved health outcomes is uncertain.       MRI is the investigation of choice in the preoperative  |staging|Cancer_Staging|  of  |rectal|Colorectal_Cancer|  and  |prostate_cancer|Prostate_Cancer|  and, has a role in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of other tumors,  as well as for determining areas of tissue for sampling in biobanking.                    MRI is the investigative tool of choice for neurological cancers over CT, as it offers better visualization of the  |posterior_cranial_fossa|Posterior_Cranial_Fossa| , containing the  |brainstem|Brainstem|  and the  |cerebellum|Cerebellum| . The contrast provided between  |grey|Grey_Matter|  and  |white_matter|White_Matter|  makes MRI the best choice for many conditions of the  |central_nervous_system|Central_Nervous_System| , including  |demyelinating_diseases|Demyelinating_Disease| ,  |dementia|Dementia| ,  |cerebrovascular_disease|Cerebrovascular_Disease| ,  |infectious_diseases|List_Of_Infections_Of_The_Central_Nervous_System| ,  |Alzheimers_disease|Alzheimers_Disease|  and  |epilepsy|Epilepsy| .    Since many images are taken milliseconds apart, it shows how the brain responds to different stimuli, enabling researchers to study both the functional and structural brain abnormalities in psychological disorders.  MRI also is used in  |guided|Image_Guided_Surgery| |stereotactic_surgery|Stereotactic_Surgery|  and  |radiosurgery|Radiosurgery|  for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations, and other surgically treatable conditions using a device known as the  |N-localizer|N-Localizer| .                    Cardiac MRI is complementary to other imaging techniques, such as  |echocardiography|Echocardiography| ,  |cardiac_CT|Computed_Tomography_Of_The_Heart| , and  |nuclear_medicine|Nuclear_Medicine| . Its applications include assessment of  |myocardial_ischemia_and_viability|Coronary_Artery_Disease| ,  |cardiomyopathies|Cardiomyopathy| ,  |myocarditis|Myocarditis| ,  |iron_overload|Iron_Overload| , vascular diseases, and  |congenital_heart_disease|Congenital_Heart_Defect| .        Applications in the musculoskeletal system include  |spinal_imaging|Spinal_Cord| , assessment of  |joint|Joint|  disease, and  |soft_tissue_tumors|Soft_Tissue_Pathology| .         |Hepatobiliary|Hepatobiliary_System|  MR is used to detect and characterize lesions of the  |liver|Liver| ,  |pancreas|Pancreas| , and  |bile_ducts|Bile_Duct| . Focal or diffuse disorders of the liver may be evaluated using  |diffusion-weighted|Diffusion_Mri| , opposed-phase imaging, and  |dynamic_contrast_enhancement|Dynamic_Contrast_Enhanced_Mri|  sequences. Extracellular contrast agents are used widely in liver MRI and newer hepatobiliary contrast agents also provide the opportunity to perform functional biliary imaging. Anatomical imaging of the bile ducts is achieved by using a heavily T2-weighted sequence in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography . Functional imaging of the pancreas is performed following administration of  |secretin|Secretin| . MR enterography provides non-invasive assessment of inflammatory bowel disease and small bowel tumors. MR-colonography may play a role in the detection of large polyps in patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer.                   Magnetic resonance  |angiography|Angiography|  generates pictures of the arteries to evaluate them for  |stenosis|Stenosis|  or  |aneurysms|Aneurysm|  . MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs . A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic|  contrast agent  or using a technique known as flow-related enhancement , where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane .     Techniques involving phase accumulation can also be used to generate flow velocity maps easily and accurately. Magnetic resonance venography is a similar procedure that is used to image veins. In this method, the tissue is now excited inferiorly, while the signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation planeâ€”thus imaging the venous blood that recently moved from the excited plane.              MRI for imaging anatomical structures or blood flow do not require contrast agents as the varying properties of the tissues or blood provide natural contrasts. However, for more specific types of imaging,  |exogenous|Exogeny|  contrast agents may be given  |intravenously|Intravenous_Therapy| ,  |orally|Oral_Administration| , or  |intra-articularly|Joint_Injection| . The most commonly used intravenous contrast agents are based on  |chelates|Chelate|  of  |gadolinium|Gadolinium| .  In general, these agents have proved safer than the iodinated contrast agents used in X-ray radiography or CT.  |Anaphylactoid_reactions|Anaphylaxis|  are rare, occurring in approx. 0.03â€“0.1%.  Of particular interest is the lower incidence of nephrotoxicity, compared with iodinated agents, when given at usual dosesâ€”this has made contrast-enhanced MRI scanning an option for patients with renal impairment, who would otherwise not be able to undergo  |contrast-enhanced_CT|Radiocontrast| .      In December 2017, the  |Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  in the  |United_States|United_States| , announced in a drug safety communication that new warnings were to be included on all gadolinium-based contrast agents . The FDA also called for increased patient education and requiring gadolinium contrast vendors to conduct additional animal and clinical studies to assess the safety of these agents.    Although gadolinium agents have proved useful for patients with renal impairment, in patients with severe renal failure requiring dialysis there is a risk of a rare but serious illness,  |nephrogenic_systemic_fibrosis|Nephrogenic_Systemic_Fibrosis| , which may be linked to the use of certain gadolinium-containing agents. The most frequently linked is  |gadodiamide|Gadodiamide| , but other agents have been linked too.  Although a causal link has not been definitively established, current guidelines in the  |United_States|United_States|  are that dialysis patients should only receive gadolinium agents where essential, and that  |dialysis|Dialysis|  should be performed as soon as possible after the scan to remove the agent from the body promptly.       In Europe, where more gadolinium-containing agents are available, a classification of agents according to potential risks has been released.   Recently, a new contrast agent named  |gadoxetate|Gadoxetic_Acid| , brand name Eovist or Primovist , was approved for diagnostic use: this has the theoretical benefit of a dual excretion path.             An  |MRI_sequence|Mri_Sequences|  is a particular setting of radiofrequency pulses and gradients, resulting in a particular image appearance.  The  |T1_and_T2|T1_And_T2|  weighting can also be described as MRI sequences.                        |Magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy|In_Vivo_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy|  is used to measure the levels of different  |metabolites|Metabolites|  in body tissues, which can be achieved through a variety of single voxel or imaging-based techniques.  The MR signal produces a spectrum of resonances that corresponds to different molecular arrangements of the isotope being excited . This signature is used to diagnose certain metabolic disorders, especially those affecting the brain,  and to provide information on tumor  |metabolism|Metabolism| .      Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging combines both spectroscopic and imaging methods to produce spatially localized spectra from within the sample or patient. The spatial resolution is much lower , but the spectra in each voxel contains information about many metabolites. Because the available signal is used to encode spatial and spectral information, MRSI requires high SNR achievable only at higher field strengths .  The high procurement and maintenance costs of MRI with extremely high field strengths  inhibit their popularity. However, recent  |compressed_sensing|Compressed_Sensing| -based software algorithms  have been proposed to achieve  |super-resolution|Super-Resolution_Imaging|  without requiring such high field strengths.              |Real-time_MRI|Real-Time_Mri|  refers to the continuous imaging of moving objects in real time. One of the many different strategies developed since the early 2000s is based on radial  |FLASH_MRI|Flash_Mri| , and  |iterative_reconstruction|Iterative_Reconstruction| . This gives a temporal resolution of 20â€“30  |ms|Millisecond|  for images with an in-plane resolution of 1.5â€“2.0  mm.  Balanced  |steady-state_free_precession_imaging|Steady-State_Free_Precession_Imaging|  has a better image contrast between the blood pool and myocardium than the  |FLASH_MRI|Flash_Mri| , yet it will produce severe banding artifact when the B0 inhomogeneity is strong.  |Real-time_MRI|Real-Time_Mri|  is likely to add important information on diseases of the heart and the joints, and in many cases may make MRI examinations easier and more comfortable for patients, especially for the patients who cannot hold their breathings or who have arrhythmia.             The lack of harmful effects on the patient and the operator make MRI well-suited for  |interventional_radiology|Interventional_Radiology| , where the images produced by an MRI scanner guide minimally invasive procedures. Such procedures use no  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic|  instruments.     A specialized growing subset of  |interventional_MRI|Interventional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging|  is  |intraoperative_MRI|Intraoperative_Mri| , in which an MRI is used in surgery. Some specialized MRI systems allow imaging concurrent with the surgical procedure. More typically, the surgical procedure is temporarily interrupted so that MRI can assess the success of the procedure or guide subsequent surgical work.        In guided therapy,  |high-intensity_focused_ultrasound|High-Intensity_Focused_Ultrasound|  beams are focused on a tissue, that are controlled using MR thermal imaging. Due to the high energy at the focus, the temperature rises to above 65  |Â°C|Â°C|  which completely destroys the tissue. This technology can achieve precise  |ablation|Ablation|  of diseased tissue. MR imaging provides a three-dimensional view of the target tissue, allowing for the precise focusing of ultrasound energy. The MR imaging provides quantitative, real-time, thermal images of the treated area. This allows the physician to ensure that the temperature generated during each cycle of ultrasound energy is sufficient to cause thermal ablation within the desired tissue and if not, to adapt the parameters to ensure effective treatment.        Hydrogen has the most frequently imaged  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  in MRI because it is present in biological tissues in great abundance, and because its high  |gyromagnetic_ratio|Gyromagnetic_Ratio|  gives a strong signal. However, any nucleus with a net  |nuclear_spin|Spin|  could potentially be imaged with MRI. Such nuclei include  |helium|Helium| -3,  |lithium|Lithium| -7,  |carbon|Carbon| -13,  |fluorine|Fluorine| -19,  |oxygen-17|Oxygen-17| ,  |sodium|Sodium| -23,  |phosphorus|Phosphorus| -31 and  |xenon-129|Xenonisotopes| . 23 Na and 31 P are naturally abundant in the body, so can be imaged directly. Gaseous isotopes such as 3 He or 129 Xe must be  |hyperpolarized|Hyperpolarization|  and then inhaled as their nuclear density is too low to yield a useful signal under normal conditions.  |17_O|Oxygen-17|  and 19 F can be administered in sufficient quantities in liquid form  that hyperpolarization is not a necessity. Using helium or xenon has the advantage of reduced background noise, and therefore increased contrast for the image itself, because these elements are not normally present in biological tissues.      Moreover, the nucleus of any atom that has a net nuclear spin and that is bonded to a hydrogen atom could potentially be imaged via heteronuclear magnetization transfer MRI that would image the high-gyromagnetic-ratio hydrogen nucleus instead of the low-gyromagnetic-ratio nucleus that is bonded to the hydrogen atom.  In principle, hetereonuclear magnetization transfer MRI could be used to detect the presence or absence of specific chemical bonds.       Multinuclear imaging is primarily a research technique at present. However, potential applications include functional imaging and imaging of organs poorly seen on 1 H MRI or as alternative contrast agents. Inhaled hyperpolarized 3 He can be used to image the distribution of air spaces within the lungs. Injectable solutions containing 13 C or stabilized bubbles of hyperpolarized 129 Xe have been studied as contrast agents for angiography and perfusion imaging. 31 P can potentially provide information on bone density and structure, as well as functional imaging of the brain. Multinuclear imaging holds the potential to chart the distribution of lithium in the human brain, this element finding use as an important drug for those with conditions such as bipolar disorder.            MRI has the advantages of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. MRI does have several disadvantages though. First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10 âˆ’3  |mol/L|Concentrationmolarity|  to 10 âˆ’5 mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. This problem stems from the fact that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. For example, at 1.5  |teslas|Tesla| , a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and  |hyperpolarization|Hyperpolarization|  via optical pumping or dynamic nuclear polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.     To achieve molecular imaging of disease biomarkers using MRI, targeted MRI contrast agents with high specificity and high relaxivity are required. To date, many studies have been devoted to developing targeted-MRI contrast agents to achieve molecular imaging by MRI. Commonly, peptides, antibodies, or small ligands, and small protein domains, such as HER-2 affibodies, have been applied to achieve targeting. To enhance the sensitivity of the contrast agents, these targeting moieties are usually linked to high payload MRI contrast agents or MRI contrast agents with high relaxivities.  A new class of gene targeting MR contrast agents has been introduced to show gene action of unique mRNA and gene transcription factor proteins.   This new CA can trace cells with unique mRNA, microRNA and virus; tissue response to inflammation in living brains.  The MR reports change in gene expression with positive correlation to TaqMan analysis, optical and electron microscopy.           In the UK, the price of a clinical 1.5-tesla MRI scanner is around Â£920,000/, with the lifetime maintenance cost broadly similar to the purchase cost.  In the Netherlands, the average MRI scanner costs around â‚¬1 million,  with a 7-T MRI having been taken in use by the UMC Utrecht in December 2007, costing â‚¬7 million.  Construction of MRI suites could cost up to /â‚¬370.000 or more, depending on project scope. Pre-polarizing MRI systems using resistive electromagnets have shown promise as a low-cost alternative and have specific advantages for joint imaging near metal implants; however, they are likely unsuitable for routine whole-body or neuroimaging applications.          MRI scanners have become significant sources of revenue for healthcare providers in the US. This is because of favorable reimbursement rates from insurers and federal government programs. Insurance reimbursement is provided in two components, an equipment charge for the actual performance and operation of the MRI scan and a professional charge for the radiologists review of the images and/or data. In the US Northeast, an equipment charge might be $3,500/â‚¬2,600 and a professional charge might be $350/â‚¬260, Stamford Hospital price quotation October 2008, Stamford CT US although the actual fees received by the equipment owner and interpreting physician are often significantly less and depend on the rates negotiated with insurance companies or determined by the Medicare fee schedule. For example, an orthopedic surgery group in Illinois billed a charge of $1,116/â‚¬825 for a knee MRI in 2007, but the Medicare reimbursement in 2007 was only $470.91/â‚¬350.  Many insurance companies require advance approval of an MRI procedure as a condition for coverage.     In the United States, an MRI of the brain with and without contrast billed to Medicare Part B entails, on average, a technical payment of /â‚¬300 and a separate payment to the radiologist of /â‚¬70.  |Current_Procedural_Terminology|Current_Procedural_Terminology|  code 70553  . Data.gov, An Official Website of the United States Government. In France, the cost of an MRI exam is approximately â‚¬150/. This covers three basic scans including one with an intravenous contrast agent as well as a consultation with the technician and a written report to the patients physician.  In Japan, the cost of an MRI examination ranges from /â‚¬115 to /â‚¬133, with an additional radiologist professional fee of /â‚¬12.50.     MRI is in general a safe technique, although injuries may occur as a result of failed safety procedures or human error.   |Contraindications|Contraindications|  to MRI include most  |cochlear_implants|Cochlear_Implant|  and  |cardiac_pacemakers|Artificial_Cardiac_Pacemaker| ,  |shrapnel|Fragmentation| , and metallic  |foreign_bodies|Foreign_Body|  in the  |eyes|Orbit| .  |Magnetic_resonance_imaging_in_pregnancy|Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_In_Pregnancy|  appears to be safe at least during the second and third  |trimesters|Pregnancy|  if done without contrast agents.  Since MRI does not use any ionizing radiation, its use is generally favored in preference to  |CT|X-Ray_Computed_Tomography|  when either modality could yield the same information.  In certain cases, MRI is not preferred as it may be more expensive, time-consuming, and claustrophobia-exacerbating.     MRI uses powerful magnets and can therefore cause  |magnetic_materials|Ferromagnetism|  to move at great speeds posing risk. Deaths have occurred.  The Guardian, 2018 However, as millions of MRIs are performed globally each year,  OECD, 2016 fatalities are extremely rare.          Medical societies issue guidelines for when physicians should use MRI on patients and recommend against overuse. MRI can detect health problems or confirm a diagnosis, but medical societies often recommend that MRI not be the first procedure for creating a plan to diagnose or manage a patients complaint. A common case is to use MRI to seek a cause of  |low_back_pain|Low_Back_Pain| ; the  |American_College_of_Physicians|American_College_Of_Physicians| , for example, recommends against this procedure as unlikely to result in a positive outcome for the patient.               An  |MRI_artifact|Mri_Artifact|  is a  |visual_artifact|Visual_Artifact| , that is, an anomaly during visual representation. Many different artifacts can occur during magnetic resonance imaging , some affecting the diagnostic quality, while others may be confused with pathology. Artifacts can be classified as patient-related, signal processing-dependent and hardware -related.           MRI is used industrially mainly for routine analysis of chemicals. The  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance|  technique is also used, for example, to measure the ratio between water and fat in foods, monitoring of flow of corrosive fluids in pipes, or to study molecular structures such as catalysts.           In 1971 at  |Stony_Brook_University|Stony_Brook_University| , Paul Lauterbur applied magnetic field gradients in all three dimensions and a back-projection technique to create NMR images. He published the first images of two tubes of water in 1973 in the journal Nature, followed by the picture of a living animal, a clam, and in 1974 by the image of the thoracic cavity of a mouse. Lauterbur called his imaging method zeugmatography, a term which was later replaced by MR imaging.  In the late 1970s, physicists  |Peter_Mansfield|Peter_Mansfield|  and  |Paul_Lauterbur|Paul_Lauterbur| , developed MRI-related techniques, like the  |echo-planar_imaging|Echo-Planar_Imaging|  technique.      Advances in  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  technology were crucial to the development of practical MRI, which requires a large amount of  |computational_power|Computational_Power| . This was made possible by the rapidly increasing number of  |transistors|Transistors|  on a single  |integrated_circuit|Integrated_Circuit|  chip.  Mansfield and Lauterbur were awarded the 2003  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|.
