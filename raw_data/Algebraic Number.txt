        An algebraic number is any  |complex_number|Complex_Number|   that is a  |root|Root_Of_A_Function|  of a non-zero  |polynomial|Polynomial|  in one variable with  |rational|Rational_Number|  coefficients . All integers and rational numbers are algebraic, as are all  |roots_of_integers|Nth_Root| . There are real and complex numbers that are not algebraic, such as  and . These numbers are called  |transcendental_numbers|Transcendental_Number| . While the set of complex numbers is  |uncountable|Uncountable_Set| , the set of algebraic numbers is  |countable|Countable_Set|  and has  |measure_zero|Measure_Zero|  in the  |Lebesgue_measure|Lebesgue_Measure|  as a subset of the complex numbers, and in this sense  |almost_all|Almost_All|  complex numbers are transcendental.       All  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number|  are algebraic. Any rational number, expressed as the quotient of two  |integers|Integer|   and ,  not equal to zero, satisfies the above definition because  is the root of a non-zero polynomial, namely . Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972: 159–160 and pp. 178–179   The  |quadratic_surds|Quadratic_Surd|   are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic  then the roots are further qualified as  |quadratic_integers|Quadratic_Integer| .   The  |constructible_numbers|Constructible_Number|  are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass. These include all quadratic surds, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the  |basic_arithmetic_operations|Arithmeticarithmetic_Operations|  and the extraction of square roots.    Any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of  |th_roots|Nth_Root|  gives another algebraic number.   Polynomial roots that cannot be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of th roots . This  |happens_with_many|Abel–Ruffini_Theorem| , but not all, polynomials of degree 5 or higher.    |Gaussian_integers|Gaussian_Integer| : those complex numbers  where both  and  are integers and are also quadratic integers.   Values of  |trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Functions|  of  |rational|Rational_Number|  multiples of  : that is, the  |trigonometric_numbers|Trigonometric_Number| . For example, each of , ,  satisfies . This polynomial is  |irreducible|Irreducible_Polynomial|  over the rationals, and so these three cosines are conjugate algebraic numbers. Likewise, , , ,  all satisfy the irreducible polynomial , and so are conjugate  |algebraic_integers|Algebraic_Integers| .   Some  |irrational_numbers|Irrational_Number|  are algebraic and some are not:   The numbers  and  are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials  and , respectively.   The  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio|   is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial .   The numbers  and  are not algebraic numbers . Also  |Liouvilles_theorem|Liouville_Number|  can be used to produce as many examples of transcendental numbers as we please, cf Hardy and Wright p.  161ff      Properties |Template:Anchor|Template:Anchor|  for details.  --   ref /ref ref /ref  ref /ref  ref /ref  math /math math /math          .
