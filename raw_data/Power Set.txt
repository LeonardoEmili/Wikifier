     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the power set  of any  |set|Set|   is the set of all  |subsets|Subset|  of , including the  |empty_set|Empty_Set|  and  itself, variously denoted as , ùí´, ‚Ñò , , , or, identifying the powerset of  with the set of all functions from  to a given set of two elements, . In  |axiomatic_set_theory|Axiomatic_Set_Theory|  , the existence of the power set of any set is  |postulated|Postulated|  by the  |axiom_of_power_set|Axiom_Of_Power_Set| .      Any subset of  is called a  family of sets  over .       If  is the set , then the subsets of  are                  and hence the power set of  is .        If  is a finite set with  elements, then the number of subsets of  is . This fact, which is the motivation for the notation , may be demonstrated simply as follows,   : First, order the elements of  in any manner. We write any subset of  in the format  where , can take the value of  or . If , the -th element of  is in the subset; otherwise, the -th element is not in the subset. Clearly the number of distinct subsets that can be constructed this way is  as .      |Cantors_diagonal_argument|Cantors_Diagonal_Argumentgeneral_Sets|  shows that the power set of a set always has strictly higher  |cardinality|Cardinality|  than the set itself . In particular,  |Cantors_theorem|Cantors_Theorem|  shows that the power set of a  |countably_infinite|Countable_Set|  set is  |uncountably|Uncountable|  infinite. The power set of the set of  |natural_numbers|Natural_Number|  can be put in a  |one-to-one_correspondence|Bijection|  with the set of  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  .     The power set of a set , together with the operations of  |union|Union| ,  |intersection|Intersection|  and  |complement|Complement|  can be viewed as the prototypical example of a  |Boolean_algebra|Boolean_Algebra| . In fact, one can show that any finite Boolean algebra is  |isomorphic|Isomorphic|  to the Boolean algebra of the power set of a finite set. For infinite Boolean algebras this is no longer true, but every infinite Boolean algebra can be represented as a  |subalgebra|Subalgebra|  of a power set Boolean algebra .     The power set of a set  forms an  |abelian_group|Abelian_Group|  when considered with the operation of  |symmetric_difference|Symmetric_Difference|  and a  |commutative|Commutative| |monoid|Monoid|  when considered with the operation of intersection. It can hence be shown  that the power set considered together with both of these operations forms a  |Boolean_ring|Boolean_Ring| .       In set theory,  is the set of all  |functions|Function|  from  to . As 2 can be defined as  ,   is the set of all  |functions|Function|  from  to . By identifying a function in  with the corresponding  |preimage|Preimage|  of , we see that there is a  |bijection|Bijection|  between  and , where each function is the  |characteristic_function|Indicator_Function|  of the subset in  with which it is identified. Hence  and  could be considered identical set-theoretically.      This notion can be applied to the example  |above|Power_Setexample|  in which  to see the isomorphism with the binary numbers   from 0 to  with  being the number of elements in the set.   In , a 1 in the position corresponding to the location in the enumerated set  indicates the presence of the element. So .     For the whole power set of  we get:        Such bijective mapping of S to integers is arbitrary, so this representation of subsets of S is not unique, but the sort order of the enumerated set does not change its cardinality.     However, such finite binary representation is only possible if S can be enumerated .       The power set is closely related to the  |binomial_theorem|Binomial_Theorem| . The number of subsets with  elements in the power set of a set with  elements is given by the number of  |combinations|Combination| , , also called  |binomial_coefficients|Binomial_Coefficient| .     For example, the power set of a set with three elements, has:     C 1 subset with 0 elements ,   C 3 subsets with 1 element ,   C 3 subsets with 2 elements ,   C 1 subset with 3 elements .     Using this relationship we can compute     using the formula:                   Therefore, one can deduce the following identity, assuming  S  n :        2S   2n           If  is a  |finite_set|Finite_Set| , there is a  |recursive_algorithm|Recursive_Algorithm|  to calculate .     Define the operation .     In English, return the set with the element  added to each set  in .     If , then  is returned.   Otherwise:   :Let  be any single element of .   :Let  be the set  with element  excluded .   :And the result:  is returned.     In words: The power set of the empty set is the set containing only the empty set and the power set of any other set is all the subsets of the set containing some specific element and all the subsets of the set not containing that specific element.     The following is a  |Python|Python|  implementation of the above algorithm as used for lists :     Verbose:     def powerset -  or .
