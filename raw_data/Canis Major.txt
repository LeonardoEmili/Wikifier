           Canis Major is a  |constellation|Constellation|  in the  |southern_celestial_hemisphere|Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere| . In the second century, it was included in  |Ptolemys|Ptolemy|  48 constellations, and is counted among the  |88_modern_constellations|88_Modern_Constellations| . Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for greater dog in contrast to  |Canis_Minor|Canis_Minor| , the lesser dog ; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of  |Orion|Orion|  the hunter through the sky. The  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  passes through Canis Major and several  |open_clusters|Open_Cluster|  lie within its borders, most notably  |M41|Messier_41| .     Canis Major contains  |Sirius|Sirius| , the  |brightest_star|List_Of_Brightest_Stars|  in the night sky, known as the dog star . It is bright because of its proximity to the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| . In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high  |luminosity|Luminosity| . At magnitude 1.5,  |Epsilon_Canis_Majoris|Epsilon_Canis_Majoris|  is the second-brightest star of the  |constellation|Constellation|  and the brightest source of  |extreme_ultraviolet|Extreme_Ultraviolet|  radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant  |Delta|Delta_Canis_Majoris|  at 1.8, the blue-white giant  |Beta|Beta_Canis_Majoris|  at 2.0, blue-white supergiants  |Eta|Eta_Canis_Majoris|  at 2.4 and  |Omicron_1_|Omicron1_Canis_Majoris|  at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary  |Zeta|Zeta_Canis_Majoris|  , also at 3.0. The red hypergiant  |VY_Canis_Majoris|Vy_Canis_Majoris|  is one of the  |largest_stars_known|List_Of_Largest_Known_Stars| , while the  |neutron_star|Neutron_Star| |_RX_J0720_4_3125|Rx_J0720_4_3125|  has a radius of a mere 5  km.           In ancient  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| , Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the  |Babylon|Babylon| ians, was seen as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of  |Puppis|Puppis|  were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the  Three Stars Each  tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled  MUL.APIN , the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior  |Ninurta|Ninurta| , and the bow with  |Ishtar|Ishtar| , daughter of  |Enlil|Enlil| .  Ninurta was linked to the later deity  |Marduk|Marduk| , who was said to have slain the ocean goddess  |Tiamat|Tiamat|  with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.       In Greek Mythology, Canis Major represented the dog  |Laelaps|Laelaps| , a gift from  |Zeus|Zeus|  to  |Europa|Europa| ; or sometimes the hound of  |Procris|Procris| ,  |Dianas|Diana|  nymph; or the one given by  |Aurora|Eos|  to  |Cephalus|Cephalus| , so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky. It was also considered to represent one of Orions hunting dogs, pursuing  |Lepus|Lepus|  the  |Hare|Hare|  or helping Orion fight  |Taurus|Taurus|  the Bull; and is referred to in this way by  |Aratos|Aratus| ,  |Homer|Homer|  and  |Hesiod|Hesiod| . The  |ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greece|  refer only to one dog, but by  |Roman|Ancient_Rome|  times,  |Canis_Minor|Canis_Minor|  appears as Orions second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter. Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521  Alfonsine tables .     The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as Custos Europae, the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  in the form of a bull, and as  Janitor Lethaeus , the watchdog . In medieval Arab astronomy, the constellation became al-Kalb al-Akbar, the Greater Dog , transcribed as Alcheleb Alachbar by 17th century writer  |Edmund_Chilmead|Edmund_Chilmead| . Islamic scholar  |Abū_Rayḥān_al_Bīrūnī|Abū_Rayḥān_Al_Bīrūnī|  referred to Orion as Kalb al-Jabbār, the Dog of the Giant . Among the  |Merazig|Merazig|  of  |Tunisia|Tunisia| , shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called  Merzem , includes the stars of Canis Major and Canis Minor and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.             In  |Chinese_astronomy|Chinese_Astronomy| , the modern constellation of  |Canis_Major|Canis_Major|  is located in the  |Vermilion_Bird|Vermilion_Bird|  , where the stars were classified in several separate  |asterisms|Asterism|  of stars. The Military Market  was a circular pattern of stars containing  |Nu_3_|Nu3_Canis_Majoris| ,  |Beta|Beta_Canis_Majoris| ,  |Xi_1_|Xi1_Canis_Majoris|  and  |Xi_2_|Xi2_Canis_Majoris| , and some stars from Lepus. The Wild Cockerel  was at the centre of the Military Market, although it is uncertain which stars depicted what. Schlegel reported that the stars  |Omicron|Omicron_Canis_Majoris|  and  |Pi_Canis_Majoris|Pi_Canis_Majoris|  might have been them, while Beta or  |Nu_2_|Nu2_Canis_Majoris|  have also been proposed.   |Sirius|Sirius|  was  , the Celestial Wolf, denoting invasion and plunder. Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism  , the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing  |Delta|Delta_Canis_Majoris| ,  |Epsilon|Epsilon_Canis_Majoris| ,  |Eta|Eta_Canis_Majoris|  and  |Kappa_Canis_Majoris|Kappa_Canis_Majoris|  and  |Delta_Velorum|Delta_Velorum| . Alternatively, the arrow was depicted by  |Omicron_2_|Omicron2_Canis_Majoris|  and Eta and aiming at Sirius , while the bow comprised Kappa, Epsilon,  |Sigma|Sigma_Canis_Majoris| , Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and  |Pi|Pi_Puppis|  and  |Omicron_Puppis|Omicron_Puppis| .     Both the  |Māori_people|Māori_People|  and the people of the  |Tuamotus|Tuamotus|  recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. , also called  and ,  was a Māori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars. Related was , also called , the Mirror of , formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major. They called Sirius  and , corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though  was a name applied to other stars in various Māori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies. The Tuamotu people called Canis Major , the abiding assemblage of  .     The Tharumba people of the  |Shoalhaven_River|Shoalhaven_River|  saw three stars of Canis Major as  and his two wives  and  ; bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole. He spears them and all three are placed in the sky as the constellation .  To the  |Boorong|Wergaia|  people of Victoria,  |Sigma_Canis_Majoris|Sigma_Canis_Majoris|  was  , and its flanking stars Delta and Epsilon were his two wives.  The moon  sought to lure the further wife away, but  assaulted him and he has been wandering the sky ever since.          Canis Major is a constellation in the  |Southern_Hemispheres|Southern_Hemisphere|  summer sky, bordered by  |Monoceros|Monoceros|  to the north, Puppis to the east and southeast,  |Columba|Columba|  to the southwest, and Lepus to the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is CMa.  The official constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a quadrilateral; in the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between −11.03° and −33.25°.  Covering 380 square degrees or 0.921% of the sky, it ranks 43rd of the 88 currently-recognized constellations in size.                  Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include Sirius , the  |brightest_star|List_Of_Brightest_Stars|  in the night sky, as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0. Furthermore, two other stars are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara shone at −3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago. Another,  |NR_Canis_Majoris|Nr_Canis_Majoris| , will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years time.      The German cartographer  |Johann_Bayer|Johann_Bayer|  used the Greek letters  |Alpha|Alpha|  through  |Omicron|Omicron|  to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, including three adjacent stars as Nu and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron, while subsequent observers designated further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from Central Europe. Bayers countryman  |Johann_Elert_Bode|Johann_Elert_Bode|  later added Sigma, Tau and Omega; the French astronomer  |Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille|Nicolas_Louis_De_Lacaille|  added lettered stars a to k .  |John_Flamsteed|John_Flamsteed|  numbered 31 stars, with 3 Canis Majoris being placed by Lacaille into Columba as  |Delta_Columbae|Delta_Columbae|  . He also labelled two stars—his  |10|10_Canis_Majoris|  and  |13_Canis_Majoris|Kappa_Canis_Majoris| —as Kappa 1 and Kappa 2 respectively, but subsequent cartographers such as  |Francis_Baily|Francis_Baily|  and  |John_Bevis|John_Bevis|  dropped the fainter former star, leaving Kappa 2 as the sole Kappa. Flamsteeds listing of Nu 1 , Nu 2 , Nu 3 , Xi 1 , Xi 2 , Omicron 1 and Omicron 2 have all remained in use.      Sirius is the  |brightest_star_in_the_night_sky|List_Of_Brightest_Stars|  at  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  −1.46 and one of the  |closest_stars_to_Earth|List_Of_Nearest_Stars|  at a distance of 8.6  |light_years|Light_Year| . Its name comes from the Greek word for scorching or searing . Sirius is also a  |binary_star|Binary_Star| ; its companion  |Sirius_B|Sirius_B|  is a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf|  with a magnitude of 8.4–10,000 times fainter than Sirius A to observers on Earth.  The two  |orbit|Orbit|  each other every 50 years. Their closest approach last occurred in 1993 and they will be at their greatest separation between 2020 and 2025. Sirius was the basis for the  |ancient_Egyptian_calendar|Ancient_Egyptian_Calendar| . The star marked the Great Dogs mouth on Bayers star atlas.     Flanking Sirius are Beta and  |Gamma_Canis_Majoris|Gamma_Canis_Majoris| . Also called Mirzam or Murzim, Beta is a blue-white  |Beta_Cephei_variable|Beta_Cephei_Variable|  star of magnitude 2.0, which varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude over a period of six hours.  Mirzam is 500 light-years from Earth, and its traditional name means the announcer , referring to its position as the announcer of Sirius, as it rises a few minutes before Sirius does. Gamma, also known as Muliphein, is a fainter star of magnitude 4.12, in reality a blue-white bright giant of  |spectral_type|Stellar_Classificationspectral_Types|  B8IIe located 441 light-years from earth.   |Iota_Canis_Majoris|Iota_Canis_Majoris| , lying between Sirius and Gamma, is another star that has been classified as a Beta Cephei variable, varying from magnitude 4.36 to 4.40 over a period of 1.92 hours.  It is a remote blue-white  |supergiant_star|Supergiant_Star|  of spectral type B3Ib, around 46,000 times as luminous as the sun and, at 2500 light-years distant, 300 times further away than Sirius.      Epsilon,  |Omicron_2_|Omicron2_Canis_Majoris| , Delta, and Eta Canis Majoris were called Al Adzari the virgins in medieval Arabic tradition.  Marking the dogs right thigh on Bayers atlas is Epsilon Canis Majoris, also known as Adhara. At magnitude 1.5, it is the second-brightest star in Canis Major and the 23rd-brightest star in the sky. It is a blue-white supergiant of spectral type B2Iab, around 404 light-years from Earth.  This star is one of the brightest known extreme ultraviolet sources in the sky.  It is a binary star; the secondary is of magnitude 7.4. Its traditional name means the virgins , having been transferred from the group of stars to Epsilon alone.  Nearby is Delta Canis Majoris, also called Wezen. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8Iab and magnitude 1.84, around 1605 light-years from Earth.  With a traditional name meaning the weight , Wezen is 17 times as massive and 50,000 times as luminous as the Sun. If located in the centre of the Solar System, it would extend out to Earth as its diameter is 200 times that of the Sun. Only around 10 million years old, Wezen has stopped fusing hydrogen in its core. Its outer envelope is beginning to expand and cool, and in the next 100,000 years it will become a red supergiant as its core fuses heavier and heavier elements. Once it has a core of iron, it will collapse and explode as a  |supernova|Supernova| .  Nestled between Adhara and Wezen lies Sigma Canis Majoris, known as Unurgunite to the Boorong and Wotjobaluk people, a red supergiant of spectral type K7Ib that varies irregularly between magnitudes 3.43 and 3.51.      Also called Aludra, Eta Canis Majoris is a blue-white supergiant of spectral type B5Ia with a luminosity 176,000 times and diameter around 80 times that of the Sun.  Classified as an  |Alpha_Cygni_type|Alpha_Cygni_Variable| |_variable_star|Variable_Star| , Aludra varies in brightness from magnitude 2.38 to 2.48 over a period of 4.7 days.  It is located 1120 light-years away. To the west of Adhara lies 3.0-magnitude  |Zeta_Canis_Majoris|Zeta_Canis_Majoris|  or Furud, around 362 light-years distant from Earth.  It is a spectroscopic binary, whose components orbit each other every 1.85 years, the combined  |spectrum|Stellar_Spectrum|  indicating a main star of spectral type B2.5V.      Between these stars and Sirius lie  |Omicron_1_|Omicron1_Canis_Majoris| , Omicron 2 , and  |Pi_Canis_Majoris|Pi_Canis_Majoris| . Omicron 2 is a massive supergiant star about 21 times as massive as the Sun.  Only 7 million years old, it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now processing helium.  It is an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day interval.  Omicron 1 is an orange  |K_type|Stellar_Classification|  supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an  |irregular_variable|Irregular_Variable|  star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99.  Around 18 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 65,000 times its  |luminosity|Luminosity| .      North of Sirius lie  |Theta|Theta_Canis_Majoris|  and  |Mu_Canis_Majoris|Mu_Canis_Majoris| , Theta being the most northerly star with a Bayer designation in the constellation.  Around 8 billion years old, it is an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the Suns diameter.  Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light-years distant, its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1-magnitude bluish star.  The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III,  while the companion is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V.   |Nu_Canis_Majoris|Nu_Canis_Majoris|  is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.7, 278 light-years away; it is at the threshold of naked-eye visibility. It has a companion of magnitude 8.1.     At the southern limits of the constellation lie Kappa and  |Lambda_Canis_Majoris|Lambda_Canis_Majoris| . Although of similar spectra and nearby each other as viewed from Earth, they are unrelated. Kappa is a  |Gamma_Cassiopeiae_variable|Shell_Star|  of spectral type B2Vne,  which brightened by 50% between 1963 and 1978, from magnitude 3.96 or so to 3.52.  It is around 659 light-years distant.  Lambda is a blue-white  |B_type|Stellar_Classification| |_main_sequence_dwarf|Main_Sequence|  with an apparent magnitude of 4.48 located around 423 light-years from  |Earth|Earth| .  It is 3.7 times as wide as and 5.5 times as massive as the Sun, and shines with 940 times its luminosity.        Canis Major is also home to many variable stars.  |EZ_Canis_Majoris|Ez_Canis_Majoris|  is a  |Wolf–Rayet_star|Wolf–Rayet_Star|  of spectral type WN4 that varies between magnitudes 6.71 and 6.95 over a period of 3.766 days; the cause of its variability is unknown but thought to be related to its stellar wind and rotation. The IUE Mega Campaign: Wind Structure and Variability of HD 50896 Astrophysical Journal Letters 452 1, pp. L57   |VY_Canis_Majoris|Vy_Canis_Majoris|  is a remote  |red_hypergiant|Red_Hypergiant|  located approximately 3,800 light-years away from  |Earth|Earth| . It is one of  |largest_stars_known|List_Of_Largest_Stars|   and is also  |one_of_most_luminous|List_Of_Most_Luminous_Stars|  with a radius varying from 1,420 to 2,200 times the Suns radius, and a luminosity around 300,000 times greater than the Sun. Its current mass is about 17 ± 8 solar masses, having shed material from an initial mass of 25–32 solar masses.   VY CMa is also surrounded by a red  |reflection_nebula|Reflection_Nebula|  that has been made by the material expelled by the strong stellar winds of its central star.  |W_Canis_Majoris|W_Canis_Majoris|  is a type of red giant known as a  |carbon_star|Carbon_Star| —a semiregular variable, it ranges between magnitudes 6.27 and 7.09 over a period of 160 days.  A cool star, it has a surface temperature of around 2,900 K and a radius 234 times that of the Sun, its distance estimated at 1,444–1,450 light-years from Earth.  At the other extreme in size is  |RX_J0720_4_3125|Rx_J0720_4_3125| , a  |neutron_star|Neutron_Star|  with a radius of around 5  km.  Exceedingly faint, it has an apparent magnitude of 26.6.  Its spectrum and temperature appear to be mysteriously changing over several years. The nature of the changes are unclear, but it is possible they were caused by an event such as the stars absorption of an  |accretion_disc|Accretion_Disc| .      |Tau_Canis_Majoris|Tau_Canis_Majoris|  is a  |Beta_Lyrae_type|Beta_Lyrae_Variable|  eclipsing multiple star system that varies from magnitude 4.32 to 4.37 over 1.28 days.  Its four main component stars are hot O-type stars, with a combined mass 80 times that of the Sun and shining with 500,000 times its luminosity, but little is known of their individual properties. A fifth component, a magnitude 10 star, lies at a distance of . The system is only 5 million years old.   |UW_Canis_Majoris|Uw_Canis_Majoris|  is another Beta Lyrae-type star 3000 light-years from Earth; it is an  |eclipsing_binary|Eclipsing_Binary|  that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 5.3 to a maximum of 4.8. It has a period of 4.4 days; its components are two massive hot blue stars, one a  |blue_supergiant|Blue_Supergiant|  of spectral type O7.5–8 Iab, while its companion is a slightly cooler, less evolved and less luminous supergiant of spectral type O9.7Ib. The stars are 200,000 and 63,000 times as luminous as the Sun. However the fainter star is the more massive at 19  |solar_mass|Solar_Mass| es to the primarys 16.   |R_Canis_Majoris|R_Canis_Majoris|  is another eclipsing binary that varies from magnitude 5.7 to 6.34 over 1.13 days,  with a third star orbiting these two every 93 years. The shortness of the orbital period and the low ratio between the two main components make this an unusual Algol-type system.      Seven star systems have been found to have planets.  |Nu_2_Canis_Majoris|Nu2_Canis_Majoris|  is an ageing orange giant of spectral type K1III of apparent magnitude 3.91 located around 64 light-years distant.  Around 1.5 times as massive and 11 times as luminous as the Sun, it is orbited over a period of 763 days by a planet 2.6 times as massive as Jupiter.   |HD_47536|Hd_47536|  is likewise an ageing orange giant found to have a planetary system—echoing the fate of the Solar System in a few billion years as the Sun ages and becomes a giant.  Conversely,  |HD_45364|Hd_45364|  is a star 107 light-years distant that is a little smaller and cooler than the Sun, of spectral type G8V, which has two planets discovered in 2008. With orbital periods of 228 and 342 days, the planets have a 3:2  |orbital_resonance|Orbital_Resonance| , which helps stabilise the system.   |HD_47186|Hd_47186|  is another sunlike star with two planets; the inner— |HD_47186_b|Hd_47186_B| —takes four days to complete an orbit and has been classified as a  |Hot_Neptune|Hot_Neptune| , while the outer— |HD_47186_c|Hd_47186_C| —has an eccentric 3.7-year period orbit and has a similar mass to  |Saturn|Saturn| .   |HD_43197|Hd_43197|  is a sunlike star around 183 light-years distant that has a Jupiter-size planet with an eccentric orbit.       |Z_Canis_Majoris|Z_Canis_Majoris|  is a star system a mere 300,000 years old composed of two  |pre_main_sequence_stars|Pre_Main_Sequence_Star| —a  |FU_Orionis_star|Fu_Orionis_Star|  and a  |Herbig_Ae_Be_star|Herbig_Ae_Be_Star| ,  which has brightened episodically by two magnitudes to magnitude 8 in 1987, 2000, 2004 and 2008.  The more massive Herbig Ae/Be star is enveloped in an irregular roughly spherical cocoon of dust that has an inner diameter of  and outer diameter of . The cocoon has a hole in it through which light shines that covers an angle of 5 to 10 degrees of its circumference. Both stars are surrounded by a large envelope of in-falling material left over from the original cloud that formed the system. Both stars are emitting jets of material, that of the Herbig Ae/Be star being much larger—11.7 light-years long.  Meanwhile,  |FS_Canis_Majoris|Fs_Canis_Majoris|  is another star with infra-red emissions indicating a compact shell of dust, but it appears to be a main-sequence star that has absorbed material from a companion. These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust.        The band of the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  goes through Canis Major, with only patchy obscurement by  |interstellar_dust|Cosmic_Dust|  clouds. It is bright in the northeastern corner of the constellation, as well as in a triangular area between Adhara, Wezen and Aludra, with many stars visible in binoculars. Canis Major boasts several  |open_clusters|Open_Cluster| .  The only  |Messier_object|Messier_Object|  is  |M41|Messier_41|  , an open cluster with a combined  |visual_magnitude|Visual_Magnitude|  of 4.5, around 2300 light-years from Earth. Located 4 degrees south of Sirius, it contains contrasting blue, yellow and orange stars and covers an area the apparent size of the  |full_moon|Full_Moon| —in reality around 25 light-years in diameter.  Its most luminous stars have already evolved into giants. The brightest is a 6.3-magnitude star of spectral type K3. Located in the field is  |12_Canis_Majoris|12_Canis_Majoris| , though this star is only 670 light-years distant.   |NGC_2360|Ngc_2360| , known as Carolines Cluster after its discoverer  |Caroline_Herschel|Caroline_Herschel| , is an open cluster located 3.5 degrees west of Muliphein and has a combined apparent magnitude of 7.2. Around 15 light-years in diameter, it is located 3700 light-years away from Earth,  and has been dated to around 2.2 billion years old.   |NGC_2362|Ngc_2362|  is a small, compact open cluster, 5200 light-years from Earth. It contains about 60 stars, of which Tau Canis Majoris is the brightest member. Located around 3 degrees northeast of Wezen, it covers an area around 12 light-years in diameter, though the stars appear huddled around Tau when seen through binoculars. It is a very young open cluster as its member stars are only a few million years old. Lying 2 degrees southwest of NGC 2362 is  |NGC_2354|Ngc_2354|  a fainter open cluster of magnitude 6.5, with around 15 member stars visible with binoculars. Located around 30 northeast of NGC 2360,   |NGC_2359|Ngc_2359|  is a relatively bright  |emission_nebula|Emission_Nebula|  in Canis Major, with an approximate magnitude of 10, which is 10,000 light-years from Earth. The nebula is shaped by  |HD_56925|Hd_56925| , an unstable  |Wolf–Rayet_star|Wolf–Rayet_Star|  embedded within it.           In 2003, an overdensity of stars in the region was announced to be the  |Canis_Major_Dwarf|Canis_Major_Overdensity| , the closest  |satellite_galaxy|Satellite_Galaxy|  to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation in the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten  |RR_Lyrae_variables|Rr_Lyrae_Variable| —consistent with the  |Milky_Ways_halo|Milky_Way_Halo|  and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy.  On the other hand, a  |globular_cluster|Globular_Cluster|  in Puppis,  |NGC_2298|Ngc_2298| —which appears to be part of the Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Ways thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.       |NGC_2207_and_IC_2163|Ngc_2207_And_Ic_2163|  are a pair of face-on  |interacting|Interacting_Galaxy|  spiral galaxies located 125 million light-years from Earth. About 40 million years ago, the two galaxies had a close encounter and are now moving farther apart; nevertheless, the smaller IC 2163 will eventually be incorporated into NGC 2207. As the interaction continues, gas and dust will be perturbed, sparking extensive  |star_formation|Star_Formation|  in both galaxies. Supernovae have been observed in NGC 2207 in 1975 ,  1999 ,  2003 ,  and 2013 .  Located 16 million light-years distant,  |ESO_489_056|Eso_489_056|  is an irregular  |dwarf_|Dwarf_Galaxy|  and  |low_surface_brightness_galaxy|Low_Surface_Brightness_Galaxy|  that has one of the lowest  |metallicities|Metallicity|  known.
