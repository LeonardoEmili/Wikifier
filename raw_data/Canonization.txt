              Canonization is the act by which a  |Christian|Christianity|  church declares that a person who has died is a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the list of recognized saints, called the canon. Originally, a person was recognized as a saint without any formal process. Later, different processes were developed, such as those used today in the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| , the  |Eastern_Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| ,  |Oriental_Orthodox_Church|Oriental_Orthodox_Church|  and the  |Anglican_Communion|Anglican_Communion| .       The  |Roman_Rites|Roman_Rite|  Canon of the  |Mass|Mass|  contains only the names of martyrs, along with that of the  |Blessed_Virgin_Mary|Mary,_Mother_Of_Jesus|  and, since 1962, that of  |Saint_Joseph|Saint_Joseph|  her spouse.     By the fourth century, however,  |confessors|Confessor|  —people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life—began to be venerated publicly. Examples of such people are Saint  |Hilarion|Hilarion|  and Saint  |Ephrem_the_Syrian|Ephrem_The_Syrian|  in the East, and Saint  |Martin_of_Tours|Martin_Of_Tours|  and Saint  |Hilary_of_Poitiers|Hilary_Of_Poitiers|  in the West. Their names were inserted in the  |diptychs|Diptych| , the lists of saints explicitly venerated in the  |liturgy|Liturgy| , and their tombs were honoured in like manner as those of the martyrs. Since the witness of their lives was not as unequivocal as that of the martyrs, they were venerated publicly only with the approval by the local  |bishop|Bishop| . This process is often referred to as local canonization .     This approval was required even for veneration of a reputed martyr. In his history of the  |Donatist|Donatism|  heresy,  |Saint_Optatus|Saint_Optatus|  recounts that at  |Carthage|Carthage|  a Catholic matron, named Lucilla, incurred the censures of the Church for having kissed the  |relics|Relic|  of a reputed martyr whose claims to martyrdom had not been juridically proved. And Saint  |Cyprian|Cyprian|  recommended that the utmost diligence be observed in investigating the claims of those who were said to have died for the faith. All the circumstances accompanying the martyrdom were to be inquired into; the faith of those who suffered, and the motives that animated them were to be rigorously examined, in order to prevent the recognition of undeserving persons. Evidence was sought from the court records of the trials or from people who had been present at the trials.      |Augustine_of_Hippo|Augustine_Of_Hippo|  tells of the procedure which was followed in his day for the recognition of a martyr. The bishop of the diocese in which the martyrdom took place set up a canonical process for conducting the inquiry with the utmost severity. The acts of the process were sent either to the  |metropolitan|Metropolitan_Bishop|  or  |primate|Primate| , who carefully examined the cause, and, after consultation with the  |suffragan|Suffragan|  bishops, declared whether the deceased was worthy of the name of martyr and public veneration.     Acts of formal recognition, such as the erection of an  |altar|Altar|  over the saints tomb or transferring the saints relics to a church, were preceded by formal inquiries into the sanctity of the persons life and the miracles attributed to that persons intercession.     Such acts of recognition of a saint were authoritative, in the strict sense, only for the  |diocese|Diocese|  or  |ecclesiastical_province|Ecclesiastical_Province|  for which they were issued, but with the spread of the fame of a saint, were often accepted elsewhere also.          The  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , the  |Mother_Church|Mother_Church|  of the  |Anglican_Communion|Anglican_Communion| , canonized  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England|  as a saint, in the  |Convocations_of_Canterbury_and_York|Convocations_Of_Canterbury_And_York|  of 1660.            In the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| , both  |Latin|Latin_Church|  and  |constituent_Eastern|Eastern_Catholic_Churches|  churches, the act of canonization is reserved to the  |Apostolic_See|Apostolic_See|  and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that they are worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Churchs official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in  |Heaven|Heaven|  and that they may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the  |liturgy|Liturgy|  of the Church, including in the  Litany of the Saints .     In the Catholic Church, canonization is a decree that allows universal veneration of the saint in the  |liturgy|Liturgy|  of the  |Roman_Rite|Roman_Rite| . For permission to venerate merely locally, only  |beatification|Beatification|  is needed. Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept .            For several centuries the  |Bishops|Bishop| , or in some places only the  |Primates|Primate|  and  |Patriarchs|Patriarch| , August., Brevic. Collat. cum Donatistis, III, 13, no. 25 in PL, XLIII, 628. could grant martyrs and confessors public ecclesiastical honor; such honor, however, was always decreed only for the local territory of which the grantors had jurisdiction. Only acceptance of the cultus by the  |Pope|Pope|  made the cultus universal, because he alone can rule the universal  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| . Gonzalez Tellez, Comm. Perpet. in singulos textus libr. Decr., III, xlv, in Cap. 1, De reliquiis et vener. Sanct. Abuses, however, crept into this discipline, due as well to indiscretions of popular fervor as to the negligence of some bishops in inquiring into the lives of those whom they permitted to be honoured as saints.     In the Medieval West, the  |Apostolic_See|Apostolic_See|  was asked to intervene in the question of canonizations so as to ensure more authoritative decisions. The canonization of  |Saint_Udalric,_Bishop_of_Augsburg|Saint_Udalric,_Bishop_Of_Augsburg|  by  |Pope_John_XV|Pope_John_Xv|  in 993 was the first undoubted example of Papal canonization of a saint from outside of  |Rome|Rome| ; some historians maintain further that the first Papal canonization was of  |St._Swibert|St._Swibert|  by  |Pope_Leo_III|Pope_Leo_Iii|  in 804.     Thereafter, recourse to the judgment of the  |Pope|Pope|  was had more frequently. Toward the end of the eleventh century the  |Popes|Pope|  judged it necessary to restrict episcopal authority regarding canonization, and therefore decreed that the virtues and miracles of persons proposed for public veneration should be examined in councils, more specifically in general councils.  |Pope_Urban_II|Pope_Urban_Ii| ,  |Pope_Calixtus_II|Pope_Calixtus_Ii| , and  |Pope_Eugene_III|Pope_Eugene_Iii|  conformed to this discipline.        |Hugh_de_Boves|Hugh_De_Boves| ,  |Archbishop_of_Rouen|Archbishop_Of_Rouen| , canonized  |Walter_of_Pontoise|Walter_Of_Pontoise| , or St. Gaultier, in 1153, the final saint in  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe|  to be canonized by an authority other than the  |Pope|Pope|   The last case of canonization by a metropolitan is said to have been that of  |St._Gaultier|Walter_Of_Pontoise| , or Gaucher, bot of Pontoise, by the Archbishop of Rouen. A decree of  |Pope_Alexander_III|Pope_Alexander_Iii|  1170 gave the prerogative to the pe thenceforth, so far as the Western Church was concerned. In a decretal of 1173,  |Pope_Alexander_III|Pope_Alexander_Iii|  reprimanded some bishops for permitting veneration of a man who was merely killed while intoxicated, prohibited veneration of the man, and most significantly decreed that you shall not therefore presume to honor him in the future; for, even if miracles were worked through him, it is not lawful for you to venerate him as a saint without the authority of the Catholic Church. Pope Gregory IX, Decretales, 3, De reliquiis et veneratione sanctorum . It is alternatively quoted as follows: For the future you will not presume to pay him reverence, as, even though miracles were worked through him, it would not allow you to revere him as a saint unless with the authority of the Roman Church . Theologians disagree as to the full import of the decretal of  |Pope_Alexander_III|Pope_Alexander_Iii| De Eccles. Triumph., I, 8. in which case the  |Pope|Pope|  then for the first time reserved the right of beatification to himself, or an existing law was confirmed.     However, the procedure initiated by the decretal of  |Pope_Alexander_III|Pope_Alexander_Iii|  was confirmed by a  |bull|Papal_Bull|  of  |Pope_Innocent_III|Pope_Innocent_Iii|  issued on the occasion of the canonization of  |Cunigunde_of_Luxembourg|Cunigunde_Of_Luxembourg|  in 1200. The  |bull|Papal_Bull|  of  |Pope_Innocent_III|Pope_Innocent_Iii|  resulted in increasingly elaborate inquiries to the  |Apostolic_See|Apostolic_See|  concerning canonizations. Because the decretal of  |Pope_Alexander_III|Pope_Alexander_Iii|  did not end all controversy and some bishops did not obey it in so far as it regarded beatification, the right of which they had certainly possessed hitherto,  |Pope_Urban_VIII|Pope_Urban_Viii|  issued the Apostolic letter Caelestis Hierusalem cives of 5 July 1634 that exclusively reserved to the  |Apostolic_See|Apostolic_See|  both its immemorial right of canonization and that of  |beatification|Beatification| . He further regulated both of these acts by issuing his Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum on 12 March 1642.       In his De Servorum Dei beatificatione et de Beatorum canonizatione of five volumes the eminent canonist Prospero Lambertini , who later became  |Pope_Benedict_XIV|Pope_Benedict_Xiv| , elaborated on the procedural norms of  |Pope_Urban_VIIIs|Pope_Urban_Viii|  Apostolic letter Caelestis Hierusalem cives of 1634 and Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum of 1642, and on the conventional practice of the time. His work published from 1734 to 1738 governed the proceedings until 1917. The article  |Beatification_and_canonization_process_in_1914|Beatification_And_Canonization_Process_In_1914|  describes the procedures followed until the promulgation of the Codex of 1917. The substance of De Servorum Dei beatifιcatione et de Beatorum canonizatione was incorporated into the  Codex Iuris Canonici   of 1917,  which governed until the promulgation of the revised  Codex Iuris Canonici  in 1983 by  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii| . Prior to promulgation of the revised Codex in 1983,  |Pope_St._Paul_VI|Pope_Paul_Vi|  initiated a simplification of the procedures.       The  |Apostolic_constitution|Apostolic_Constitution|  Divinus Perfectionis Magister of  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii|  of 25 January 1983  and the norms issued by the  |Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints|Congregation_For_The_Causes_Of_Saints|  on 7 February 1983 to implement the constitution in dioceses, continued the simplification of the process initiated by  |Pope_Paul_VI|Pope_Paul_Vi| .  Contrary to popular belief, the reforms did not eliminate the office of the Promoter of the Faith , popularly known as the  |Devils_advocate|Devils_Advocate|  , whose office is to question the material presented in favor of canonization. The reforms were intended to reduce the adversarial nature of the process. In November 2012  |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi|  appointed Monsignor Carmello Pellegrino as Promoter of the Faith.      Candidates for canonization undergo the following process:     Servant of God  |bishop|Bishop|  with jurisdiction, usually the bishop of the place where the candidate died or is buried, although another ordinary can be given this authority, gives permission to open an investigation into the virtues of the individual in response to a petition of members of the faithful, either actually or  pro forma . Pope John Paul II,  , Art. 1, Sec. 1. This investigation usually commences no sooner than five years after the death of the person being investigated. Pietro Cardinal Palazzini, , 1983 , §9. The  |Pope|Pope| , qua Bishop of Rome, may also open a process and has the authority to waive the waiting period of five years, e. g., as was done for  |St._Teresa_of_Calcutta|St._Teresa_Of_Calcutta|  by  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii| , , Office of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, Internet Office of the Holy See and for  |Lúcia_Santos|Lúcia_Santos|  and for  |Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope_John_Paul_Ii|  himself by  |Pope_Benedict_XVI|Pope_Benedict_Xvi| .   |Cardinal|Cardinal| |José_Saraiva_Martins|José_Saraiva_Martins| ,  |CMF|Claretians| , , 2005  Normally, an association to promote the cause of the candidate is instituted, an exhaustive search of the candidates writings, speeches, and sermons is undertaken, a detailed biography is written, and eyewitness accounts are collected. When sufficient evidence has been collected, the local bishop presents the investigation of the candidate, who is titled Servant of God , to the  |Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_the_Saints|Congregation_For_The_Causes_Of_The_Saints|  of the  |Roman_Curia|Roman_Curia| , where the cause is assigned a  |postulator|Postulator| , whose office is to collect further evidence of the life of the Servant of God. Religious orders that regularly deal with the Congregation often designate their own Postulator General. At some time, permission is then granted for the body of the Servant of God to be exhumed and examined. A certification non-cultus is made that no superstitious or heretical worship, or improper cult of the Servant of God or his tomb has emerged, and relics are taken and preserved.   Venerable  or Heroic in Virtue : When sufficient evidence has been collected, the Congregation recommends to the  |Pope|Pope|  that he proclaim the  |heroic_virtue|Heroic_Virtue|  of the Servant of God; that is, that the Servant of God exercised to a heroic degree the  |theological_virtues|Theological_Virtues|  of faith, hope, and charity and the  |cardinal_virtues|Cardinal_Virtues|  of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. From this time the one said to be heroic in virtue is entitled  Venerable  . A Venerable does not yet have a  |feast_day|Feast_Day| , permission to erect churches in his honor has not yet been granted, and the Church does not yet issue a statement on his probable or certain presence in  |Heaven|Heaven| , but  |prayer_cards|Prayer_Card|  and other materials may be printed to encourage the faithful to pray for a  |miracle|Miracle|  wrought by his intercession as a sign of Gods will that the person be canonized.    Blessed   |Heaven|Heaven|  and saved. Attaining this grade depends on whether the Venerable is a  |martyr|Martyr| |Pope|Pope|  has only to make a declaration of martyrdom, which is a certification that the Venerable gave his life voluntarily as a witness of the Faith or in an  |act_of_heroic_charity|Act_Of_Heroic_Charity|  for others.   For a non-martyr, all of them being denominated confessors because they confessed , i. e., bore witness to the Faith by how they lived, proof is required of the occurrence of a  |miracle|Miracle|  through the intercession of the Venerable; that is, that God granted a sign that the person is enjoying the  |Beatific_Vision|Beatific_Vision|  by performing a miracle for which the Venerable interceded. Presently, these miracles are almost always miraculous cures of infirmity, because these are the easiest to judge given the Churchs evidentiary requirements for miracles; e. g., a patient was sick with an illness for which no cure was known; prayers were directed to the Venerable; the patient was cured; the cure was spontaneous, instantaneous, complete, and enduring; and physicians cannot discover any natural explanation for the cure.     The satisfaction of the applicable conditions permits  |beatification|Beatification| , which then bestows on the Venerable the title of Blessed . A  |feast_day|Feast_Day|  will be designated, but its observance is ordinarily only permitted for the Blesseds home  |diocese|Diocese| , to specific locations associated with them, or to the churches or houses of the Blesseds religious order if they belonged to one. Parishes may not normally be named in honor of beati.      Saint   |Sacred_College_of_Cardinals|College_Of_Cardinals| , and the  |Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints|Congregation_For_The_Causes_Of_Saints|  all agree that the Blessed lived a life of great merit proven by certain actions. This extraordinary procedure was used in  |Pope_Francis|Pope_Francis|  canonization of  |Pope_John_XXIII|Pope_John_Xxiii| , who convoked the first part of the  |Second_Vatican_Council|Second_Vatican_Council| .     Canonization is a statement of the Church that the person certainly enjoys the  |Beatific_Vision|Beatific_Vision|  of  |Heaven|Heaven| . The title of Saint  is then proper, reflecting that the Saint is a refulgence of the holiness  of God Himself, which alone comes from Gods gift. The Saint is assigned a  |feast_day|Feast_Day|  which may be celebrated anywhere in the universal Church, although it is not necessarily added to the  |General_Roman_Calendar|General_Roman_Calendar|  or local calendars as an obligatory feast; parish churches may be erected in his honor; and the faithful may freely celebrate and honor the Saint.     Although recognition of sainthood by the  |Pope|Pope|  does not directly concern a fact of  |Divine_revelation|Divine_Revelation| , nonetheless it must be definitively held by the faithful as infallible pursuant to, at the least, the  |Universal_Magisterium_of_the_Church|Infallibility_Of_The_Church| , because it is a truth related to revelation by historical necessity. , by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. , The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 2. New York, New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. P. 366.     Regarding the  |Eastern_Catholic_Churches|Eastern_Catholic_Churches| , individual  sui juris  churches have the right to glorify saints for their own jurisdictions, though this has rarely happened.         Popes have several times permitted to the universal Church, without executing the ordinary judicial process of canonization described above, the veneration as a saint, the  cultus  of one long venerated as such locally. This act of a pope is denominated equipollent or equivalent canonization and confirmation of cultus . According to the rules  |Pope_Benedict_XIV|Pope_Benedict_Xiv|   instituted, there are three conditions for an equipollent canonization: existence of an ancient cultus of the person, a general and constant attestation to the virtues or martyrdom of the person by credible historians, and uninterrupted fame of the person as a worker of miracles.     As examples, prior to his pontificate, of this mode of canonization,  |Pope_Benedict_XIV|Pope_Benedict_Xiv|  himself enumerated the equipollent canonizations of Saints:    |Romuald|Romuald|  - 9 July 1595    |Norbert|Norbert| - 7 September 1621    |Bruno|Bruno_Of_Cologne|  - 6 October 1623    |Peter_Nolasco|Peter_Nolasco|  - 20 October 1655    |Raymond_Nonnatus|Raymond_Nonnatus|  - 10 March 1681    |King_Stephen_of_Hungary|Stephen_Of_Hungary|  - 28 November 1686    |Queen_Margaret_of_Scotland|Saint_Margaret_Of_Scotland|  - 15 September 1691    |John_of_Matha|John_Of_Matha|  and  |Felix_of_Valois|Felix_Of_Valois|  - 19 March 1694    |Pope_Gregory_VII|Pope_Gregory_Vii|  - 25 September 1728    |Duke_Wenceslaus_of_Bohemia|Wenceslaus_I,_Duke_Of_Bohemia|  - 14 March 1729    |Gertrude_of_Helfta|Gertrude_Of_Helfta|  - 20 July 1738.     Later equipollent canonizations include those of Saints:    |Peter_Damian|Peter_Damian|  - 1 October 1828    |Cyril_and_Methodius|Cyril_And_Methodius|  - 30 September 1880    |Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria| ,  |Cyril_of_Jerusalem|Cyril_Of_Jerusalem| ,  |Justin_Martyr|Justin_Martyr|  and  |Augustine_of_Canterbury|Augustine_Of_Canterbury|  - 28 July 1882    |John_of_Damascus|John_Of_Damascus|  and  |Sylvester_Gozzolini|Sylvester_Gozzolini|  - 29 August 1890    |Bede_the_Venerable|Bede_The_Venerable|  - 25 May 1899    |Boniface|Boniface|  - 4 May 1919    |Ephrem_the_Syrian|Ephrem_The_Syrian|  - 5 October 1920    |Albert_the_Great|Albert_The_Great|  - 15 December 1931    |John_Fisher|John_Fisher|  and  |Thomas_More|Thomas_More|  - 19 May 1935    |Margaret_of_Hungary|Margaret_Of_Hungary|  - 19 November 1943    |Gregorio_Barbarigo|Gregorio_Barbarigo|  - 26 May 1960    |John_of_Ávila|John_Of_Ávila|  - 31 May 1970    |Nikola_Tavelić|Nikola_Tavelić|  and his three companion martyrs - 21 June 1970    |Meinhard_of_Livonia|Meinhard_Of_Livonia|  - 1993    |Marko_Krizin|Marko_Krizin| ,  |István_Pongrácz|István_Pongrácz| , and  |Melchior_Grodziecki|Melchior_Grodziecki|  - 2 July 1995    |Hildegard_of_Bingen|Hildegard_Of_Bingen|  - 10 May 2012      |Pope_Francis|Pope_Francis|  added Saints:    |Angela_of_Foligno|Angela_Of_Foligno|  Angelo Amato, La canonizzazione equipollente della mistica Angela da Foligno in LOsservatore Romano . - 9 October 2013    |Peter_Faber|Peter_Faber|  - 17 December 2013    |José_de_Anchieta|José_De_Anchieta| ,   |Marie_of_the_Incarnation|Marie_Of_The_Incarnation| , and  |Francis-Xavier_de_Montmorency-Laval|François_De_Laval|  - 3 April 2014      |Bartholomew_of_Braga|Bartholomew_Of_Braga|  - 5 July 2019               The following terms are used for canonization by the  |autocephalous|Autocephalous| |national|National_Polity| |Orthodox_Church|Orthodox_Church| es: канонизация  or прославление   |glorification|Glorificationeastern_Orthodox_Church|   by  |Protopresbyter|Protopresbyter| |Michael_Pomazansky|Michael_Pomazansky|  , კანონიზაცია kanonizats’ia , канонизација , canonizare , and Канонизация .
