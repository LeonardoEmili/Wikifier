In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was either the son of  |Zeus|Zeus|  and  |Hera|Hera|  or he was Heras  |parthenogenous|Parthenogenesis|  child. He was cast off Mount Olympus by his mother because of his deformity or, in another account, by Zeus for protecting Hera from his advances.      As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus. He served as the blacksmith of the gods, and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centers of Greece, particularly  |Athens|Athens| . The cult of Hephaestus was based in  |Lemnos|Lemnos| . Hephaestus symbols are a smiths  |hammer|Hammer| ,  |anvil|Anvil| , and a pair of  |tongs|Tongs| .       Hephaestus is probably associated with the  |Linear_B|Linear_B|   inscription , A-pa-i-ti-jo, found at Knossos; the inscription indirectly attests his worship at that time because it is believed that it reads the  |theophoric_name|Theophoric_Name|  Haphaistios or Haphaistion.

Il. xviii. 370, & c. Hephaestus crafted much of the magnificent equipment of the gods, and almost any finely wrought metalwork imbued with powers that appears in Greek myth is said to have been forged by Hephaestus. He designed  |Hermes|Hermes|  winged helmet and  |sandals|Talaria| , the  |Aegis|Aegis| |breastplate|Breastplate| ,  |Aphrodites|Aphrodite|  famed  |girdle|Girdle| ,  |Agamemnons|Agamemnon|  staff of office, The provenance of the staff of office is recounted in Iliad II  |Achilles|Achilles|  armor,  |Diomedes|Diomedes| |cuirass|Cuirass| ,  |Heracles|Heracles|  bronze  |clappers|Clapper| ,  |Helios|Helios|  chariot, the shoulder of  |Pelops|Pelops| , and  |Eross|Eros|  bow and arrows. In later accounts, Hephaestus worked with the help of the  |Cyclopes|Cyclopes| —among them his assistants in the forge, Brontes, Steropes and Pyracmon.  Virg. Aen. viii. 416, & c.     Hephaestus built  |automatons|Automaton|  of metal to work for him. This included tripods that walked to and from  |Mount_Olympus|Mount_Olympus| . He gave to the blinded  |Orion|Orion|  his apprentice  |Cedalion|Cedalion|  as a guide. In some versions of the myth,   |Prometheus|Prometheus|  stole the fire that he gave to man from Hephaestuss forge. Hephaestus also created the gift that the gods gave to man, the woman  |Pandora|Pandora|  and her  |pithos|Pithos| . Being a skilled blacksmith, Hephaestus created all the thrones in the Palace of Olympus.     The Greek myths and the  |Homeric|Homeric|  poems sanctified in stories that Hephaestus had a special power to produce motion.  |Iliad|Iliad| , XVIII 372ff He made the golden and silver lions and dogs at the entrance of the palace of  |Alkinoos|Alkinoos|  in such a way that they could bite the invaders.  |Iliad|Iliad| , VIII: Nigel Spivey : The Greek art. Phaidon Press Limited, p.9 The Greeks maintained in their civilization an  |animistic|Animism|  idea that statues are in some sense alive. This kind of art and the animistic belief goes back to the  |Minoan|Minoan_Civilization|  period, when  |Daedalus|Daedalus| , the builder of the  |labyrinth|Labyrinth| , made images which moved of their own accord. Diodorus Siculus, LV 76 A statue of the god was somehow the god himself, and the image on a mans tomb indicated somehow his presence. C.M.Bowra .The Greek experience. The World Publishing company. p.159       According to Hesiod  Hera gave birth to Hephaestus on her own as revenge for Zeus giving birth to Athena without her .   According to Homer  Hera is mentioned as the mother of Hephaestus but there is not sufficient evidence to say that Zeus was his father .   According to Homer  there is not sufficient evidence to say that Zeus was the father of Hephaestus . Hera is not mentioned as the mother.   According to Pseudo-Apollodorus  Hera gave birth to Hephaestus alone. Pseudo-Apollodorus also relates that, according to Homer, Hephaestus is one of the children of Zeus and Hera .   Several later texts follow Hesiods account, including  |Hyginus|Hyginus|  and the preface to  Fabulae .     In the account of Attic vase painters, Hephaestus was present at the birth of Athena and wields the axe with which he split Zeus head to free her. In the latter account, Hephaestus is there represented as older than Athena, so the mythology of Hephaestus is inconsistent in this respect.       In one branch of Greek mythology, Hera ejected Hephaestus from the heavens because he was shrivelled of foot . He fell into the ocean and was raised by  |Thetis|Thetis|   and the  |Oceanid|Oceanid| |Eurynome|Eurynome| . Homeric Hymn to Apollo ; Homer, Iliad .     In another account, Hephaestus, attempting to rescue his mother from Zeus advances, was flung down from the heavens by Zeus. He fell for an entire day and landed on the island of  |Lemnos|Lemnos| , where he was cared for and taught to be a master craftsman by the  |Sintians|Sintians|    an ancient tribe native to that island.  |Homer|Homer| ,  Iliad  ;  |Valerius_Flaccus|Gaius_Valerius_Flaccus| , ii, 8.5;  |Apollodorus|Bibliotheca| , i, 3 § 5. Apollodorus confounds the two occasions on which Hephaestus was thrown from Olympus. Later writers describe his lameness as the consequence of his second fall, while Homer makes him lame and weak from his birth.          Hephaestus was one of the Olympians to have returned to Olympus after being exiled.     In an archaic story, Features within the narrative suggest to Kerenyi and others that it is archaic; the most complete literary account, however, is a late one, in the Roman rhetorician  |Libanios|Libanios| , according to Hedreen . Guy Hedreen The Return of Hephaistos, Dionysiac Processional Ritual and the Creation of a Visual Narrative. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 124 p.  38 and note.  Hephaestus gained revenge against Hera for rejecting him by making her a magical golden throne, which, when she sat on it, did not allow her to stand up. A section The Binding of Hera is devoted to this archaic theme in Kerenyi , who refers to this ancient story , which is one of the tales of guileful deeds performed by cunning gods, mostly at a time when they had not joined the family on Olympus . The other gods begged Hephaestus to return to Olympus to let her go, but he refused, saying I have no mother .          At last,  |Dionysus|Dionysus|  fetched him, intoxicated him with wine, and took the subdued smith back to Olympus on the back of a mule accompanied by revelers   a scene that sometimes appears on painted pottery of Attica and of Corinth. Axel Seeberg Hephaistos Rides Again. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 85, pp.  102  109, describes and illustrates four pieces of Corinthian painted pottery with the theme A black red-figure  |calpis|Calpis|  in the collection of Marsden J. Perry was painted with the return of Hephaestus . L. G. Eldridge An Unpublished Calpis. American Journal of Archaeology, 21.1, pp  38  54 . In the painted scenes, the padded dancers and phallic figures of the Dionysan throng leading the mule show that the procession was a part of the  |dithyrambic|Dithyrambic|  celebrations that were the forerunners of the  |satyr_plays|Satyr_Play|  of fifth century Athens.

Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies, 5, pp  43 |ff.|Wikt:Ff.|      The theme of the return of Hephaestus, popular among the Attic vase-painters whose wares were favored among the  |Etruscans|Etruscans| , may have introduced this theme to Etruria. The return of Hephaestus was painted on the Etruscan tomb at the Grotta Campana near  |Veii|Veii|  was identified by Petersen ; the well-known subject was doubted in this instance by Harmon .

American Journal of Archaeology, 16.1, 1  10 ; In the vase-painters portrayal of the procession, Hephaestus was mounted on a mule or a horse, with Dionysus holding the bridle and carrying Hephaestus tools .     The traveller  |Pausanias|Pausanias|  reported seeing a painting in the temple of Dionysus in Athens, which had been built in the 5th  century but may have been decorated at any time before the 2nd century CE. When Pausanias saw it, he said:          According to most versions, Hephaestuss consort is  |Aphrodite|Aphrodite| , who is unfaithful to Hephaestus with a number of gods and mortals, including  |Ares|Ares| . However, in Book XVIII of Homers  Iliad , the consort of Hephaestus is a lesser Aphrodite,  |Charis|Charis|  or  |Aglaia|Aglaea|    the youngest of the  |Graces|Graces| , as  |Hesiod|Hesiod|  calls her. Hesiod,  Theogony , 945        In  |Athens|Athens| , there is a  |Temple_of_Hephaestus|Temple_Of_Hephaestus| , the Hephaesteum near the  |agora|Agora| . An Athenian  |founding_myth|Founding_Myth|  tells that the citys patron goddess,  |Athena|Athena| , refused a union with Hephaestus. Pseudo-Apollodorus records an archaic legend, which claims that Hephaestus once attempted to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, causing him to  |ejaculate|Ejaculate|  on her thigh.  Athena wiped the  |semen|Semen|  off using a tuft of  |wool|Wool| , which she tossed into the dust, impregnating  |Gaia|Gaia|  and causing her to give birth to  |Erichthonius|Erichthonius_Of_Athens| , whom Athena adopted as her own child. The Roman mythographer  |Hyginus|Hyginus|  records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeuss skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.  |Hyginus|Gaius_Julius_Hyginus|  made an imaginative etymology for Erichthonius, of strife  between Athena and Hephaestus and the Earth-child .     On the island of Lemnos, Hephaestus consort was the sea  |nymph|Nymph| |Cabeiro|Cabeiro| , by whom he was the father of two metalworking gods named the  |Cabeiri|Cabeiri| . In Sicily, his consort was the nymph  |Aetna|Aetna| , and his sons were two gods of Sicilian  |geysers|Geysers|  called  |Palici|Palici| . With  |Thalia|Thalia| , Hephaestus was sometimes considered the father of the  |Palici|Palici| .     Hephaestus fathered several children with mortals and immortals alike. One of those children was the robber  |Periphetes|Periphetes| .     This is the full list of his consorts and children according to the various accounts:      |Aphrodite|Aphrodite| |Aglaea|Aglaea| |Eucleia|Eucleia| |Euthenia|Euthenia| |Eupheme|Eupheme| |Philophrosyne|Philophrosyne| |Aetna|Aetna|    The  |Palici|Palici| |Cabeiro|Cabeiro| |Strabo|Strabo| , Geographica 10.321 citing  |Pherecydes|Pherecydes_Of_Leros|    The  |Cabeiri|Cabeiri|    The Cabeirian nymphs    |Gaia|Gaia| |Erichthonius|Erichthonius_Of_Athens|    Anticleia    |Periphetes|Periphetes|    by unknown mothers   Ardalus    |Cercyon|Cercyon| |Olenus|Olenus|    Palaemonius,  |Argonauts|Argonauts|    Philottus   Pylius   Spinter     In addition, the Romans claim their equivalent god, Vulcan, to have produced the following children:    |Cacus|Cacus| |Caeculus|Caeculus|           Though married to Hephaestus, Aphrodite had an affair with Ares, the god of war. Eventually, Hephaestus discovered Aphrodite’s affair through  |Helios|Helios| , the all-seeing Sun, and planned a trap during one of their trysts. While Aphrodite and Ares lay together in bed, Hephaestus ensnared them in an unbreakable chain-link net so small as to be invisible and dragged them to Mount Olympus to shame them in front of the other gods for retribution.     The gods laughed at the sight of these naked lovers, and  |Poseidon|Poseidon|  persuaded Hephaestus to free them in return for a guarantee that Ares would pay the adulterers fine. Hephaestus states in The Odyssey that he would return Aphrodite to her father and demand back his bride price.     The  |Thebans|Thebes|  told that the union of Ares and Aphrodite produced  |Harmonia|Harmonia| . However, of the union of Hephaestus with Aphrodite, there was no issue unless  |Virgil|Virgil|  was serious when he said that  |Eros|Eros|  was their child.  Aeneid  i.664 Later authors explain this statement by saying that Eros was sired by Ares but passed off to Hephaestus as his own son.     Hephaestus was somehow connected with the archaic, pre-Greek  |Phrygia|Phrygia| n and  |Thracian|Thrace|  mystery cult of the  |Kabeiroi|Kabeiroi| , who were also called the Hephaistoi, the Hephaestus-men , in Lemnos. One of the three Lemnian tribes also called themselves Hephaestion and claimed direct descent from the god.       Hephaestus is to the male gods as Athena is to the females, for he gives skill to mortal artists and was believed to have taught men the arts alongside Athena. Od. vi. 233, xxiii. 160. Hymn. in Vaulc. 2. & c. He was nevertheless believed to be far inferior to the sublime character of Athena. At Athens they had temples and festivals in common. See Dict of Ant. s. v. Hêphaisteia, Chalkeia. Both were believed to have great healing powers, and Lemnian earth from the spot on which Hephaestus had fallen was believed to cure madness, the bites of snakes, and haemorrhage, and priests of Hephaestus knew how to cure wounds inflicted by snakes. Philostr. Heroic. v. 2; Eustath. ad Hom. p.  330; Dict. Cret. ii. 14.     He was represented in the temple of Athena Chalcioecus  at Sparta, in the act of delivering his mother; Paus. iii. 17. § 3 on the chest of Cypselus, giving Achilless armour to Thetis; v. 19. § 2 and at Athens there was the famous statue of Hephaestus by Alcamenes, in which his lameness was only subtly portrayed. Cic. de Nat. Deor. i. 30; Val. Max. viii. 11. § 3 The Greeks frequently placed small dwarf-like statues of Hephaestus near their hearths, and these figures are the oldest of all his representations. Herod. iii. 37; Aristoph. Av. 436; Callim. Hymnn. in Dian. 60 During the best period of Grecian art he was represented as a vigorous man with a beard, and is characterized by his hammer or some other crafting tool, his oval cap, and the  |chiton|Chiton| .     Athena is sometimes thought to be the ‘soul-mate’ of Yet a kind of cloudy mysteriousness shrouds their relationship; no single tradition was ever clearly established on this subject, and so what confronts us is a blurred image based on rumors and conflicting reports. Nonetheless, he seeks impetuously and passionately to make love to Athena: at the moment of climax she pushes him aside, and his semen falls to the earth where it impregnates Gaia.        Hephaestus was associated by Greek colonists in southern  |Italy|Italy|  with the  |volcano|Volcano|  gods  |Adranus|Adranus|   and  |Vulcanus|Vulcan|  of the  |Lipari|Lipari|  islands. The first-century sage  |Apollonius_of_Tyana|Apollonius_Of_Tyana|  is said to have observed, there are many other mountains all over the earth that are on fire, and yet we should never be done with it if we assigned to them giants and gods like Hephaestus . Life of Apollonius of Tyana, book v.16.       In the Trojan war, Hephaestus sided with the Greeks, but was also worshiped by the Trojans and saved one of their men from being killed by Diomedes.  |Homer|Homer| ,  Iliad , v, 9 |ff.|Wikt:Ff.|  Hephaestus’ favourite place in the mortal world was the island of  |Lemnos|Lemnos| , where he liked to dwell among the Sintians, Od. viii. 283 |ff.|Wikt:Ff.| |Homer|Homer| ,  Iliad , i, 593.  |Ovid|Ovid| ,  Fasti , viii, 82. but he also frequented other volcanic islands such as Lipara, Hiera, Imbros and Sicily, which were called his abodes or workshops.  |Apollonius_of_Rhodes|Apollonius_Of_Rhodes| , iii. 41.  |Callimachus|Callimachus| , Hymn. in Dian. 47 Serv. ad Aen, viii, 416.  |Strabo|Strabo| , p.  275.  |Pliny|Pliny_The_Elder| ,  Naturalis Historia , iii, 9.  |Valerius_Flaccus|Gaius_Valerius_Flaccus| , ii, 96.     The epithets and surnames by which Hephaestus is known by the poets generally allude to his skill in the  |plastic_arts|Plastic_Arts|  or to his figure or lameness. The Greeks frequently placed small dwarf-like statues of Hephaestus near their hearths, and these figures are the oldest of all his representations.  |Heroditus|Heroditus| , iii, 37  |Aristophanes|Aristophanes| , Av., 436.  |Callimachus|Callimachus| , Hymn. in Dian., 60.       Hephaestus was sometimes portrayed as a vigorous man with a beard and was characterized by his hammer or some other crafting tool, his oval cap, and the  |chiton|Chiton| .     Hephaestus is described in mythological sources as lame , and halting .  Odyssey  ;  Iliad  , etc.   He was depicted with crippled feet and as misshapen, either from birth or as a result of his fall from Olympus. In vase paintings, Hephaestus is usually shown lame and bent over his anvil, hard at work on a metal creation, and sometimes with his feet back-to-front: Hephaistos amphigyēeis. He walked with the aid of a stick. The  |Argonaut|Argonauts|  Palaimonius, son of Hephaestus was also lame.  |Apollonius_of_Rhodes|Apollonius_Of_Rhodes| ,  Argonautica  i.204.     Other sons of Hephaestus were the  |Cabeiri|Cabeiri|  on the island of  |Samothrace|Samothrace| , who were identified with the  |crab|Crab|   by the lexicographer  |Hesychius|Hesychius_Of_Alexandria| . The adjective karkinopous signified lame , according to Detienne and Vernant.  Cited by  The Cabeiri were also lame.     In some myths, Hephaestus built himself a wheeled chair or chariot with which to move around, thus helping him overcome his lameness while demonstrating his skill to the other gods.  In the Iliad 18.371, it is stated that Hephaestus built twenty bronze wheeled tripods to assist him in moving around.      Hephaestus’s ugly appearance and lameness is taken by some to represent  |peripheral_neuropathy|Peripheral_Neuropathy|  and  |skin_cancer|Skin_Cancer|  resulting from  |arsenicosis|Arsenic_Poisoning|  caused by  |arsenic|Arsenic|  exposure from metalworking.  Bronze age smiths added arsenic to  |copper|Copper|  to produce harder  |arsenical_bronze|Arsenical_Bronze| , especially during periods of  |tin|Tin| |scarcity|Tin_Sources_And_Trade_In_Ancient_Times| . Many  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  smiths would have suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning as a result of their livelihood. Consequently, the mythic image of the lame smith is widespread. As Hephaestus was an iron-age smith, not a bronze-age smith, the connection is one from ancient folk memory.        Parallels in other mythological systems for Hephaestuss symbolism include:   The  |Ugarit|Ugarit|  craftsman-god  |Kothar-wa-Khasis|Kothar-Wa-Khasis| , who is identified from afar by his distinctive walk   possibly suggesting that he limps. Baruch Margalit, Aqhat Epic 1989:289.   As  |Herodotus|Herodotus|  was given to understand, the  |Egyptian|Ancient_Egypt|  craftsman-god  |Ptah|Ptah|  was a dwarf, naked, and deformed. Herodotus, iii.36.   In Norse mythology,  |Weyland_the_Smith|Wayland_Smith|  was a lame bronzeworker.   In Hinduism the artificer god  |Tvastr|Tvastr|  fills a similar role, albeit more positively portrayed. West, Martin Litchfield , Indo-European Poetry and Myth, Oxford, England: Oxford University Press,    The Ossetian god  |Kurdalagon|Kurdalagon|  may share a similar origin.
