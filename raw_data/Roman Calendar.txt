               The Roman calendar was the  |calendar|Calendar|  used by the  |Roman_kingdom|Roman_Kingdom|  and  |republic|Roman_Republic| . The term often includes the  |Julian_calendar|Julian_Calendar|  established by the reforms of the  |dictator|Roman_Dictator| |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  and  |emperor|Roman_Emperor| |Augustus|Augustus|  in the late 1stcentury and sometimes includes any system dated by  |inclusive_counting|Inclusive_Counting|  towards months  |kalends|Kalends| ,  |nones|Nones| , and  |ides|Ides|  in the Roman manner. The term usually excludes the  |Alexandrian_calendar|Alexandrian_Calendar|  of  |Roman_Egypt|Roman_Egypt| , which continued the unique months of that lands  |former_calendar|Egyptian_Calendar| ; the  |Byzantine_calendar|Byzantine_Calendar|  of the  |later_Roman_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| , which usually dated the Roman months in the simple count of the  |ancient_Greek_calendars|Ancient_Greek_Calendar| ; and the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| , which refined the Julian system to bring it into still closer alignment with the  |solar_year|Solar_Year|  and is the basis of the  |current_international_standard|Iso_8601| .     Roman dates were  |counted_inclusively|Inclusive_Counting|  forward to the next of three principal days: the first of the month , a day less than the middle of the month , and eight days—nine, counting inclusively—before this . The original calendar consisted of 10 months beginning in spring with  |March|March| ; winter was left as an unassigned span of days. These months ran for 38  |nundinal|Nundinae|  cycles, each forming an eight-day  |week|Week|   ended by religious rituals and a public market. The winter period was later divided into two months,  |January|Ianuarius|  and  |February|Februarius| . The  |legendary|Roman_Legend| |early_kings|List_Of_Kings_Of_Rome| |Romulus|Romulus|  and  |Numa_Pompilius|Numa_Pompilius|  were traditionally credited with establishing this early fixed calendar, which bears traces of its origin as an observational  |lunar_one|Lunar_Calendar| . In particular, the kalends, nones, and ides seem to have derived from the first sighting of the  |crescent_moon|Lunar_Phase| , the  |first-quarter_moon|First-Quarter_Moon| , and the  |full_moon|Full_Moon|  respectively. The system ran well short of the solar year, and it needed constant  |intercalation|Wikt:Intercalation|  to keep  |religious_festivals|Roman_Festivals|  and other activities in their proper  |seasons|Season| . For superstitious reasons, such intercalation occurred within the month of February even after it was no longer considered the last month.     After the  |establishment|Overthrow_Of_The_Roman_Monarchy|  of the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic| , years began to be dated by  |consulships|Roman_Consul|  and control over intercalation was granted to the  |pontifices|Pontifex_Maximus| , who eventually abused their power by lengthening years controlled by their political allies and shortening the years in their rivals terms of office. Having won  |his_war|Caesars_Civil_War|  with  |Pompey|Pompey_The_Great| ,  |Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  used his position as Romes  |chief_pontiff|Pontifex_Maximus|  to enact a  |calendar_reform|Julian_Reform|  in 46, coincidentally making the year of his third consulship last for 446 days. In order to avoid interfering with Romes religious ceremonies, the reform added all its days towards the ends of months and did not adjust any nones or ides, even in months which came to have 31 days. The Julian calendar was supposed to have a single  |leap_day|Leap_Day|  on  |24_February|February_24|   every fourth year but following  |Caesars_assassination|Assassination_Of_Caesar|  the priests figured this using inclusive counting and mistakenly added the bissextile day every three years. In order to bring the calendar back to its proper place,  |Augustus|Augustus|  was obliged to suspend intercalation for one or two decades. The revised calendar remained slightly longer than the solar year; by the 16th century the date of  |Easter|Easter|  had shifted so far away from the  |vernal_equinox|Vernal_Equinox|  that  |Pope_Gregory_XIII|Pope_Gregory_&_Nbsp;Xiii|  ordered the calendar’s adjustment, resulting in the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| .               The original Roman  |calendar|Calendar|  is believed to have been an observational  |lunar_calendar|Lunar_Calendar|  whose months began from the first signs of a new crescent moon. Because a  |lunar_cycle|Lunar_Phase|  is about  days long, such months would have varied between 29 and 30 days. Twelve such months would have fallen 10 or 11 days short of the  |solar_year|Solar_Year| ; without adjustment, such a year would have quickly rotated out of alignment with the seasons in the manner of the  |Islamic_calendar|Islamic_Calendar| . Given the seasonal aspects of the later calendar and its associated religious festivals, this was presumably avoided through some form of  |intercalation|Wikt:Intercalation|  or through the suspension of the calendar during winter.     Romes 8-day week, the  |nundinal_cycle|Nundinal_Cycle| , was shared with the  |Etruscans|Etruscans| , who used it as the schedule of royal audiences. It was presumably a part of the early calendar and was credited in  |Roman_legend|Roman_Legend|  variously to  |Romulus|Romulus|  and  |Servius_Tullius|Servius_Tullius| .            The Romans themselves described their first organized year as one with ten fixed months, each of 30 or 31  days. Such a decimal division fitted general Roman practice. The four 31  day months were called full  and the others hollow .  |Censorinus|Censorinus| ,  |Macrobius|Macrobius| , and  |Solinus|Solinus| , cited in  |Key|Thomas_Hewitt_Key| . . Its 304  days made up exactly 38   |nundinal_cycles|Nundinal_Cycle| . The system is usually said to have left the remaining 50  odd days of the year as an unorganized winter , although  |Licinius_Macers|Gaius_Licinius_Macer|  lost history apparently stated the earliest Roman calendar employed intercalation instead and  |Macrobius|Macrobius|  claims the 10  month calendar was allowed to shift until the summer and winter months were completely misplaced, at which time additional days belonging to no month were simply inserted into the calendar until it seemed things were restored to their proper place.     Later Roman writers credited this calendar to  |Romulus|Romulus| , their  |legendary|Roman_Legend| |first_king|Kings_Of_Rome|  and  |culture_hero|Culture_Hero| , although this was common with other practices and traditions whose origin had been lost to them. Some scholars doubt the existence of this calendar at all, as it is only attested in late Republican and Imperial sources and apparently supported only by the misplaced names of the months from September to December. .  |Rüpke|Jörg_Rüpke|  also finds the coincidence of the length of the supposed Romulan year with the length of the first ten months of the Julian calendar to be suspicious.              Other traditions existed alongside this one, however.  |Plutarchs|Plutarch|   Parallel Lives  recounts that  |Romuluss|Romulus|  calendar had been solar but adhered to the general principle that the year should last for 360  days. Months were employed secondarily and haphazardly, with some counted as 20  days and others as 35 or more.            The attested calendar of the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic|  was quite different. It followed  |Greek_calendars|Ancient_Greek_Calendars|  in assuming a  |lunar_cycle|Lunar_Cycle|  of  days and a  |solar_year|Solar_Year|  of   |synodic_months|Synodic_Month|  , which align every fourth year after the addition of two intercalary months. The additional two months of the year were  |January|Ianuarius|  and  |February|Februarius| ; the intercalary month was sometimes known as  |Mercedonius|Mercedonius| .     The Romans did not follow the usual Greek practice in alternating 29- and 30-day months and a 29- or 30-day intercalary month every other year. Instead, their 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 10th months had 31 days each; all the other months had 29 days except February, which had 28 days for three years and then 29 every fourth year. The total of these months over a 4-year span differed from the Greeks by 5 days, meaning the Roman intercalary month always had 27 days. Similarly, within each month, the weeks did not vary in the Greek fashion between 7 and 8 days; instead, the full months had two additional days in their first week and the other three weeks of every month ran for 8 days . . Still more unusually, the intercalary month was not placed at the end of the year but within the month of February after the  |Terminalia|Terminalia|  on the 23rd ; the remaining days of February followed its completion. This seems to have arisen from Roman superstitions concerning the numbering and order of the months. The arrangement of the Roman calendar similarly seems to have arisen from  |Pythagorean|Pythagoreans|  superstitions concerning the luckiness of  |odd_numbers|Odd_Number| .     These Pythagorean-based changes to the Roman calendar were generally credited by the Romans to  |Numa_Pompilius|Numa_Pompilius| ,  |Romuluss|Romulus|  successor and the second of  |Romes_seven_kings|Kings_Of_Rome| , as were the two new months of the calendar. Most sources thought he had established intercalation with the rest of his calendar. Although  |Livys|Livy|  Numa instituted a lunar calendar, the author claimed the king had instituted a 19-year system of intercalation equivalent to the  |Metonic_cycle|Metonic_Cycle|  centuries before its development by  |Babylonian|Babylonian_Astronomers|  and  |Greek_astronomers|Ancient_Greek_Astronomy| .  |Plutarchs|Plutarch|  account claims he ended the former chaos of the calendar by employing 12 months totaling 354 days—the length of the  |lunar|Synodic_Month|  and  |Greek_years|Ancient_Greek_Calendars| —and biennial intercalary months of 22 days.     According to Livys  |Periochae|Periochae| , the beginning of the consular year changed from March to January 1 in 154 BC in order to respond to a rebellion in Hispania.  |Ovid|Ovid|  states January began as the first month and February the last, with its present order owing to the  |Decemvirs|Decemvirs| .  |W._Warde_Fowler|W._Warde_Fowler|  believed the  |Roman_priests|Ancient_Roman_Religion|  continued to treat January and February as the last months of the calendar throughout the Republican period.              The consuls terms of office were not always a modern calendar year, but ordinary consuls were elected or appointed annually. The traditional  |list_of_Roman_consuls|List_Of_Roman_Consuls|  used by the Romans to date their years began in 509. .             |Gnaeus_Flavius|Gnaeus_Flavius| , a secretary  to censor  |App._Claudius_Caecus|Appius_Claudius_Caecus|  introduced a series of reforms in 304. Their exact nature is uncertain, although he is thought to have begun the custom of publishing the calendar in advance of the month, depriving the priests of some of their power but allowing for a more consistent calendar for official business.                |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| , following his  |victory|Battle_Of_Pharsalia|  in  |his_civil_war|Caesars_Civil_War|  and in his role as  pontifex maximus , ordered a  |reformation_of_the_calendar|Julian_Reform|  in 46. This was undertaken by a group of scholars apparently including the  |Alexandria|Alexandria| n  |Sosigenes|Sosigenes_Of_Alexandria|  and the Roman M. Flavius. Its main lines involved the insertion of ten additional days throughout the calendar and regular intercalation of a single  |leap_day|Leap_Day|  every fourth year in order to bring the Roman calendar into close agreement with the solar year. The year 46 was the last of the old system and included 3 intercalary months, the first inserted in February and two more— and —before the kalends of December.          After  |Caesars_assassination|Assassination_Of_Julius_Caesar| ,  |Mark_Antony|Mark_Antony|  had Caesars birth month Quintilis renamed  |July|July|   in his honor. After Antonys  |defeat_at_Actium|Battle_Of_Actium| ,  |Augustus|Augustus|  assumed control of Rome and, finding the priests had been intercalating every third year instead of every fourth, suspended the addition of leap days to the calendar for one or two decades until its proper position had been restored. See  |Julian_calendar:_Leap_year_error|Julian_Calendarleap_Year_Error| . In 8, the  |plebiscite|Plebiscite|  Lex Pacuvia de Mense Augusto renamed Sextilis  |August|August|   in his honor.     In large part, this calendar continued unchanged under the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| .  A few emperors altered the names of the months after themselves or their family, but such changes were abandoned by their successors.  |Diocletian|Diocletian|  began the 15-year  |indiction|Indiction|  cycles beginning from the 297  |census|Ancient_Roman_Census| ; these became the required format for official dating under  |Justinian|Justinian_I| .  |Constantine|Constantine_The_Great|  formally established the 7-day  |week|Week|  by making  |Sunday|Sunday|  an official holiday in 321. Consular dating became obsolete following the abandonment of appointing nonimperial consuls in 541. The Roman method of numbering the days of the month never became widespread in the Hellenized eastern provinces and was eventually abandoned by the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire|  in  |its_calendar|Byzantine_Calendar| .               Roman dates were  |counted_inclusively|Inclusive_Counting|  forward to the next one of three principal days within each month:      Kalends  , the 1st day of each month .   Nones , the 7th day of full months and 5th day of hollow ones, 8 days— nine by Roman reckoning—before the Ides in every month   Ides , the 15th day of full months and the 13th day of hollow ones, a day less than the middle of each month     These are thought to reflect a prehistoric lunar calendar, with the kalends proclaimed after the sighting of the first sliver of the new crescent moon a day or two after the  |new_moon|New_Moon| , the nones occurring on the day of the  |first-quarter_moon|First-Quarter_Moon| , and the ides on the day of the  |full_moon|Full_Moon| . The kalends of each month were sacred to  |Juno|Juno|  and the ides to  |Jupiter|Jupiter| . The day before each was known as its eve ; the day after each  was considered particularly unlucky.     The days of the month were expressed in early Latin using the  |ablative_of_time|Ablative_Of_Time| , denoting points in time, in the contracted form the 6th December Kalends . In classical Latin, this use continued for the three principal days of the month . but other days were idiomatically expressed in the  |accusative_case|Accusative_Case| , which usually  |expressed_a_duration_of_time|Accusative_Of_Time| , and took the form 6th day before the December Kalends . This anomaly may have followed the treatment of days in  |Greek|Ancient_Greek_Language| , reflecting the increasing use of such date phrases as an absolute phrase able to function as the object of another preposition, . or simply originated in a mistaken agreement of  with the preposition  once it moved to the beginning of the expression. In  |late_Latin|Late_Latin| , this idiom was sometimes abandoned in favor of again using the ablative of time.     The kalends were the day for payment of debts and the account books  kept for them gave English its word  calendar . The public Roman calendars were the  fasti , which designated the religious and legal character of each months days. The Romans marked each day of such calendars with the letters: F  on days when it was legal to initiate action in the courts of civil law    C  on fasti days during which the Roman people could hold  |assemblies|Legislative_Assemblies_Of_The_Roman_Republic|     N  on days when political and judicial activities were prohibited    NP  on public holidays    QRCF  on days when the king  could convene an assembly   EN  on days when most political and religious activities were prohibited in the morning and evening due to  |sacrifices|Religion_In_Ancient_Romesacrifice|  being prepared or offered but were acceptable for a period in the middle of the day     Each day was also marked by a letter from A to H to indicate its place within the  |nundinal_cycle|Nundinal_Cycle|  of market days.             The  |nundinae|Nundinae|  were the market days which formed a kind of  |weekend|Weekend|  in  |Rome|Ancient_Rome| ,  |Italy|Roman_Italy| , and some other parts of Roman territory. By Roman  |inclusive_counting|Inclusive_Counting| , they were reckoned as ninth days although they actually occurred every eighth day. Because the republican and Julian years were not evenly divisible into eight-day periods,  |Roman_calendars|Fasti|  included a column giving every day of the year a  |nundinal_letter|Nundinal_Letter|  from A to H marking its place in the cycle of market days. Each year, the letter used for the markets would shift 2–5 letters along the cycle. As a day when the city swelled with rural  |plebeians|Plebeians| , they were overseen by the  |aediles|Aedile|  and took on an important role in Roman legislation, which was supposed to be announced for three nundinal weeks in advance of its coming to a vote. The  |patricians|Patricians|  and their  |clients|Patronage_In_Ancient_Rome|  sometimes exploited this fact as a kind of  |filibuster|Filibuster| , since the  |tribunes_of_the_plebs|Tribunes_Of_The_Plebs|  were required to wait another three-week period if their proposals could not receive a vote before dusk on the day they were introduced. Superstitions arose concerning the bad luck that followed a nundinae on the nones of a month or, later, on the  |first_day|January_Kalends|  of  |January|January| . Intercalation was supposedly used to avoid such coincidences, even after the Julian reform of the calendar.     The  |7-day_week|7-Day_Week|  began to be observed in  |Italy|Roman_Italy|  in the early imperial period, as practitioners and converts to eastern religions introduced  |Hellenistic_and_Babylonian_astrology|Planetary_Hours| , the  |Jewish|Judaism_In_Ancient_Rome| |Saturday|Saturday| |sabbath|Jewish_Sabbath| , and the  |Christian|Christianity_In_Ancient_Rome| |Lords_Day|Lords_Day| . The system was originally used for private worship and astrology but had replaced the nundinal week by the time  |Constantine|Constantine_I|  made  |Sunday|Sunday|   an official day of rest in   321. The hebdomadal week was also reckoned as a cycle of letters from A to G; these were adapted for Christian use as the  |dominical_letters|Dominical_Letter| .       The names of Roman months originally functioned as adjectives before being treated as substantive nouns in their own right . Some of their etymologies are well-established: January and March honor the gods  |Janus|Janus|  . and  |Mars|Mars| ; . July and August honor the  |dictator|Dictator| |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  . and his successor, the  |emperor|List_Of_Roman_Emperors| |Augustus|Augustus| ; . and the months Quintilis, . Sextilis, . September, . October, . November, . and December . are archaic adjectives formed from the  |ordinal_numbers|Ordinal_Number|  from 5 to 10, their position in the calendar when it began around the spring equinox in March. Others are uncertain. February may derive from the Februa festival or its eponymous  , whose name may be either  |Sabine|Sabine_Language|  or preserve an archaic word for  |sulphur|Sulphur| ic. . April may relate to the  |Etruscan|Etruscans|  goddess Apru or the verb  . May and June may honor  |Maia|Maia|  . and  |Juno|Juno|  . or derive from archaic terms for senior and junior . A few  |emperors|List_Of_Roman_Emperors|  attempted to add themselves to the calendar after Augustus, but without enduring success.     In classical Latin, the days of each month were usually reckoned as:              Dates after the ides count forward to the kalends of the next month and are expressed as such. For example, March 19 was expressed as the 14th day before the April Kalends , without a mention of March itself. The day after a kalends, nones, or ides was also often expressed as the day after  owing to their special status as particularly unlucky black days .     The anomalous status of the new 31-day months under the Julian calendar was an effect of Caesars desire to avoid affecting the  |festivals|Roman_Festivals|  tied to the nones and ides of various months. However, because the dates at the ends of the month all counted forward to the next kalends, they were all shifted by one or two days by the change. This created confusion with regard to certain anniversaries. For instance,  |Augustuss|Augustus|  birthday on the 23rd day of September was  in the old calendar but  under the new system. The ambiguity caused honorary festivals to be held on either or both dates.          The Republican calendar only had 355 days, which meant that it would quickly unsynchronize from the solar year, causing, for example, agricultural festivals to occur out of season. The Roman solution to this problem was to periodically lengthen the calendar by adding  |extra_days|Intercalation|  within February. February was broken into two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the  |Terminalia|Terminalia|  on the 23rd , which was considered the end of the religious year; the five remaining days beginning with the  |Regifugium|Regifugium|  on the 24th  formed the second part; and the intercalary month  |Mercedonius|Mercedonius|  was inserted between them. In such years, the days between the ides and the Regifugium were counted down to either the Intercalary Kalends or to the Terminalia. The intercalary month counted down to nones and ides on its 5th and 13th day in the manner of the other short months. The remaining days of the month counted down towards the March Kalends, so that the end of Mercedonius and the second part of February were indistinguishable to the Romans, one ending on  and the other picking up at  and bearing the normal festivals of such dates.     Apparently because of the confusion of these changes or uncertainty as to whether an intercalary month would be ordered, dates after the February ides are attested as sometimes counting down towards the  |Quirinalia|Quirinalia|  , the  |Feralia|Feralia|  , or  |Terminalia|Terminalia|  A 94 inscription. rather than the intercalary or March kalends.     The third-century writer Censorinus says:     When it was thought necessary to add an intercalary month of 22 or 23 days, so that the civil year should correspond to the natural year, this intercalation was in preference made in February, between Terminalia and Regifugium Censorinus, The Natal Day, 20.28, tr. William Maude, New York 1900, available at .     The fifth-century writer Macrobius says that the Romans intercalated 22 and 23 days in alternate years ; the intercalation was placed after 23 February and the remaining five days of February followed . To avoid the nones falling on a nundine, where necessary an intercalary day was inserted in the middle of the Terminalia, where they placed the intercalary month .     This is historically correct. In 167 BC  |Intercalaris|Mercedonius|  began on the day after 23 February Livy 45.44.3. and in 170 BC it began on the second day after 23 February. Livy 43.11.13.  |Varro|Varro| , writing in the first century BC, says the twelfth month was February, and when intercalations take place the five last days of this month are removed. Varro, On the Latin language, 6.13, tr. Roland Kent, London 1938, available at . Since all the days after the Ides of Intercalaris were counted down to the beginning of March Intercalaris had either 27 days or 28 .     There is another theory which says that in intercalary years February had 23 or 24 days and Intercalaris had 27. No date is offered for the Regifugium in 378-day years. Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, there were only three intercalary years, each of 377 days. This refinement brings the calendar back in line with the seasons, and averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.     The Pontifex Maximus determined when an intercalary month was to be inserted. On average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through intercalary months broke down at least twice: the first time was during and after the  |Second_Punic_War|Second_Punic_War| . It led to the reform of the 191    |Acilian_Law_on_Intercalation|Lex_Acilia_De_Intercalando| , the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The second breakdown was in the middle of the first century   and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected  |Roman_magistrates|Magistratus_Ordinarii_/_Extraordinarii|  was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would have reason to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.     Although there are many stories to interpret the intercalation, a period of 22 or 23 days is always ¾ synodic month. Obviously, the month beginning shifts forward after intercalation.             As mentioned above, Romes legendary 10-month calendar notionally lasted for 304 days but was usually thought to make up the rest of the  |solar_year|Solar_Year|  during an unorganized winter period. The unattested but almost certain lunar year and the pre-Julian civil year were 354 or 355 days long, with the difference from the solar year more or less corrected by an irregular intercalary month. The  |Julian_year|Julian_Calendar|  was 365 days long, with a  |leap_day|Leap_Day|  doubled in length every fourth year, almost equivalent to the present  |Gregorian_system|Gregorian_Calendar| .     The  |calendar_era|Calendar_Era|  before and under the  |Roman_kings|Roman_Kingdom|  is uncertain but dating by  |regnal_years|Regnal_Year|  was common in antiquity. Under the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic| , from 509, years were most commonly described in terms of their reigning  |ordinary_consuls|Roman_Consul| .   |Consular_lists|List_Of_Roman_Consuls|  were displayed on the  |public_calendars|Fasti| . After the institution of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , regnal dates based on the emperors terms in office became more common. Some historians of the later republic and early imperial eras dated from the legendary founding of the city of Rome .  |Varros|Varro|  date for this was 753 but other writers used different dates, varying by several decades. Such dating was, however, never widespread. After the consuls waned in importance, most Roman dating was regnal . or followed  |Diocletians|Diocletian|  15-year  |Indiction|Indiction|  tax cycle. These cycles were not distinguished, however, so that year 2 of the indiction may refer to any of 298, 313, 328, & c. The  |Orthodox|Greek_Orthodox_Church|  subjects of the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire|  used various Christian eras, including  |those_based_on_Diocletians_persecutions|Anno_Martyrum| ,  |Christs_incarnation|Incarnation| , and  |the_supposed_age_of_the_world|Anno_Mundi| .     The Romans did not have records of their early calendars but, like modern historians, assumed the year originally began in March on the basis of the names of the months following June. The consul  |M._Fulvius_Nobilior|Marcus_Fulvius_Nobilior|   wrote a commentary on the calendar at the Temple of Hercules Musarum that claimed January had been named for  |Janus|Janus|  because the god faced both ways, suggesting it had been instituted as a first month. It was, however, usually said to have been instituted along with February, whose nature and festivals suggest it had originally been considered the last month of the year. The consuls term of office—and thus the order of the years under the republic—seems to have changed several times. Their inaugurations were finally moved to  |1January|1_January|   in 153 to allow  |Q._Fulvius_Nobilior|Quintus_Fulvius_Nobilior|  to attack  |Segeda|Segeda|  in  |Spain|Prehistoric_Spain|  during the  |Celtiberian_Wars|Celtiberian_Wars| , before which they had occurred on  |15March|15_March|  . There is reason to believe the inauguration date had been  |1May|1_May|  during the  until 222 and  |Livy|Livy|  mentions earlier inaugurations on 15May , 1July , 1August , 1October , and 15December . Under the Julian calendar, the year began on 1January but years of the  |Indiction|Indiction|  cycle began on 1September.     In addition to  |Egypts_separate_calendar|Egyptian_Calendar| , some provinces maintained their records using a local era.  |Africa|Africa|  dated its records sequentially from 39;  |Spain|Roman_Spain|  from 38. This dating system continued as the  |Spanish_era|Spanish_Era|  used in  |medieval_Spain|Medieval_Spain| .       The continuity of names from the Roman to the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar|  can lead to the mistaken belief that Roman dates correspond to Julian or Gregorian ones. In fact, the essentially complete  |list_of_Roman_consuls|List_Of_Roman_Consuls|  allows general certainty of years back to  |the_establishment|Expulsion_Of_Tarquin|  of the  |republic|Roman_Republic|  but the uncertainty as to the end of lunar dating and the irregularity of Roman intercalation means that dates which can be independently verified are invariably weeks to months outside of their proper place. Two astronomical events dated by  |Livy|Livy|  show the calendar 4 months out of alignment with the Julian date in 190 and 2 months out of alignment in 168. Thus, the year of the consulship of  |Publius_Cornelius_Sciopio_Africanus|Publius_Cornelius_Sciopio_Africanus|  and  |Publius_Licinius_Crassus|Publius_Licinius_Crassus_Dives|   actually began on 15March 205 and ended on 14March 204 according to the Roman calendar but may have begun as early as November or December 206 owing to its misalignment. Even following the establishment of the  |Julian_calendar|Julian_Calendar| , the leap years were not applied correctly by the Roman priests, meaning dates are a few days out of their proper place until a few decades into Augustuss reign.     Given the paucity of records regarding the state of the calendar and its intercalation, historians have reconstructed the correspondence of Roman dates to their Julian and Gregorian equivalents from disparate sources. There are detailed accounts of the decades leading up to the Julian reform, particularly the speeches and letters of  |Cicero|Cicero| , which permit an established chronology back to about 58. The  |nundinal_cycle|Nundinal_Cycle|  and a few known synchronisms—e.g., a Roman date in terms of the  |Attic_calendar|Attic_Calendar|  and  |Olympiad|Olympiad| —are used to generate contested chronologies back to the start of the  |First_Punic_War|First_Punic_War|  in 264. Beyond that, dates are roughly known based on clues such as the dates of  |harvests|Harvest|  and seasonal  |religious_festivals|Roman_Festivals|.
