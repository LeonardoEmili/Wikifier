   A sonnet is a  |poetic_form|Poetic_Form|  which originated at the Court of the  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor| |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in  |Palermo|Palermo| ,  |Sicily|Sicily| . The 13th century poet and  |notary|Notary| |Giacomo_da_Lentini|Giacomo_Da_Lentini|  is credited with the sonnets invention and the  |Sicilian_School|Sicilian_School|  of poets who surrounded him is credited with its spread. The earliest sonnets, however, no longer survive in the original  |Sicilian_dialect|Sicilian_Dialect| , but only after being translated into  |Tuscan_dialect|Tuscan_Dialect| .     The term sonnet is derived from the Sicilian word sonetto . By the thirteenth century it signified a poem of fourteen lines that follows a strict  |rhyme_scheme|Rhyme_Scheme|  and specific structure. Conventions associated with the sonnet have evolved over its history. Writers of sonnets are sometimes called sonneteers , although the term can be used  |derisively|Wikt:Derision| .          The sonnet was created by  |Giacomo_da_Lentini|Giacomo_Da_Lentini| , head of the  |Sicilian_School|Sicilian_School|  under  |Emperor_Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| . Ernest Hatch Wilkins, The invention of the sonnet, and other studies in Italian literature , pp. 11–39  |Guittone_dArezzo|Guittone_Darezzo|  rediscovered it and brought it to  |Tuscany|Tuscany|  where he adapted it to his language when he founded the Siculo-Tuscan School, or Guittonian school of poetry . He wrote almost 250 sonnets.  Other Italian poets of the time, including  |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri|  and  |Guido_Cavalcanti|Guido_Cavalcanti|  , wrote sonnets, but the most famous early sonneteer was  |Petrarch|Petrarch| . Other fine examples were written by  |Michelangelo|Michelangelo| .     The structure of a typical Italian sonnet of the time included two parts that together formed a compact form of argument . First, the  |octave|Octave| , forms the proposition , which describes a problem , or question , followed by a  |sestet|Sestet|  , which proposes a resolution . Typically, the ninth line initiates what is called the turn , or  |volta|Volta|  , which signals the move from proposition to resolution. Even in sonnets that dont strictly follow the problem/resolution structure, the ninth line still often marks a turn by signaling a change in the tone, mood, or stance of the poem.     Later, the ABBA ABBA pattern became the standard for Italian sonnets. For the sestet there were two different possibilities: CDE CDE and CDC CDC. In time, other variants on this rhyming scheme were introduced, such as CDCDCD. Petrarch typically used an ABBA ABBA pattern for the octave, followed by either CDE CDE or CDC CDC rhymes in the sestet. The Crybin variant of the Italian sonnet has the rhyme scheme ABBA CDDC EFG EFG.       Most Sonnets in Dantes  La Vita Nuova  are Petrarchan. Chapter VII gives sonnet O voi che per la via , with two sestets and two quatrains , and Ch. VIII, Morte villana , with two sestets and two quatrains .       In  |American_poetry|American_Poetry| , the first notable poet to use the sonnet form was  |Edgar_Allan_Poe|Edgar_Allan_Poe| .      |Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow|Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow|  also wrote and translated many sonnets, among others the cycle Divina Commedia .  He used the Italian rhyme scheme.     The New York born  |Sephardic_Jewish|Sephardi_Jews|  poet  |Emma_Lazarus|Emma_Lazarus|  also published many sonnets. She is the author of perhaps the best-known American sonnet,  |The_New_Colossus|The_New_Colossus|  ,  which celebrates the  |Statue_of_Liberty|Statue_Of_Liberty|  and her role in welcoming immigrants to the United States.     Among the major poets of the early Modernist period,  |Robert_Frost|Robert_Frost| ,  |Edna_St._Vincent_Millay|Edna_St._Vincent_Millay|  and  |E._E._Cummings|E._E._Cummings|  all used the sonnet regularly.     In 1928, American poet and painter  |John_Allan_Wyeth|John_Allan_Wyeth|  published This Mans Army: A War in Fifty-Odd Sonnets. The collection, with a rhyme scheme unique in the history of the sonnet, traces Wyeths military service with the  |American_Expeditionary_Force|American_Expeditionary_Force|  in France during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . According to  |Dana_Gioia|Dana_Gioia| , who rescued Wyeths work from obscurity during the early  |21st_century|21St_Century| , Wyeth is the only American poet of the Great War who deserves comparison with British  |war_poets|War_Poets| |Siegfried_Sassoon|Siegfried_Sassoon|  and  |Wilfred_Owen|Wilfred_Owen| .     During the  |Harlem_Renaissance|Harlem_Renaissance| ,  |African_American|African_American|  writers of sonnets included  |Paul_Lawrence_Dunbar|Paul_Lawrence_Dunbar| ,  |Claude_McKay|Claude_Mckay| ,  |Countee_Cullen|Countee_Cullen| ,  |Langston_Hughes|Langston_Hughes| , and  |Sterling_A._Brown|Sterling_A._Brown| .      Other modern poets, including  |Don_Paterson|Don_Paterson| ,  |Edwin_Morgan|Edwin_Morgan| ,  |Joan_Brossa|Joan_Brossa| ,  |Paul_Muldoon|Paul_Muldoon|  have used the form.  |Wendy_Copes|Wendy_Cope|  poem Stress is a sonnet.  |Elizabeth_Bishops|Elizabeth_Bishop|  inverted Sonnet was one of her last poems.  |Ted_Berrigans|Ted_Berrigan|  book, The Sonnets, is conventional almost exclusively in line count .   |Paul_Muldoon|Paul_Muldoon|  often experiments with 14 lines and sonnet rhymes, though without regular sonnet meter.     At the height of the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  in 1967, American poet  |Richard_Wilbur|Richard_Wilbur|  composed A Miltonic Sonnet for Mr. Johnson on His Refusal of Peter Hurds Official Portrait. In a clear cut case of criticism from the Right , Wilbur compares U.S. President  |Lyndon_Baines_Johnson|Lyndon_Baines_Johnson|  with  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson|  and finds the former to be greatly wanting. Commenting that Jefferson would have wept to see small nations dread/ The imposition of our cattle brand, and that in Jeffersons term, no armys blood was shed , Wilbur urges President Johnson to seriously consider how history will judge him and his Administration.     Beginning in the 1970s and 80s, the  |New_Formalist_Revival|New_Formalism|  has also created a revival of the sonnet form in  |American_poetry|American_Poetry| . Between 1994 and 2017, first  The Formalist  and then  Measure  sponsored the  |Howard_Nemerov_Sonnet_Award|Howard_Nemerov_Sonnet_Award| , which was annually offered for the best new sonnet.      |Rhina_Espaillat|Rhina_Espaillat| , a Dominican immigrant and prominent New Formalist poet, has translated many Spanish and Latin American sonnets into English. No volume of her many translations, however, has yet been published.     This revival includes the invention of the  |word_sonnet|Word_Sonnet|  , which is a fourteen line poem, with one word per line. Preface . Foreplay: An Anthology of Word Sonnets, ed., Edited by Seymour Mayne and Christal Steck.  Frequently allusive and imagistic, word sonnets can also be irreverent and playful.      |Canadian_poetry|Canadian_Poetry| |Confederation_Poets|Confederation_Poets|  and especially  |Archibald_Lampman|Archibald_Lampman|  were known for their sonnets, which were mainly on pastoral themes.     Canadian poet  |Seymour_Mayne|Seymour_Mayne|  has published a few collections of word sonnets, and is one of the chief innovators of the form. See  , by Seymour Mayne, French translation:  |Sabine_Huynh|:Fr:Sabine_Huynh| , University of Ottawa Press, 2011.          The sonnet was introduced into Czech literature at the beginning of the 19th century. The first great Czech sonneteer was  |Ján_Kollár|Ján_Kollár| , who wrote a cycle of sonnets named Slávy Dcera . Kollár was Slovak and a supporter of Pan-Slavism, but wrote in Czech, as he disagreed that Slovak should be a separate language. Kollárs magnum opus was planned as a Slavic epic poem as great as Dantes  |Divine_Comedy|Divine_Comedy| . It consists of The Prelude written in quantitative  |hexameters|Hexameter| , and sonnets. The number of poems increased in subsequent editions and came up to 645.  The greatest Czech romantic poet,  |Karel_Hynek_Mácha|Karel_Hynek_Mácha|  also wrote many sonnets. In the second half of the 19th century  |Jaroslav_Vrchlický|Jaroslav_Vrchlický|  published Sonety samotáře . Another poet, who wrote many sonnets was  |Josef_Svatopluk_Machar|Josef_Svatopluk_Machar| . He published Čtyři knihy sonetů . In the 20th century  |Vítězslav_Nezval|Vítězslav_Nezval|  wrote the cycle 100 sonetů zachránkyni věčného studenta Roberta Davida . After the Second World War the sonnet was the favourite form of  |Oldřich_Vyhlídal|Oldřich_Vyhlídal| . Czech poets use different metres for sonnets, Kollár and Mácha used decasyllables, Vrchlický iambic pentameter,  |Antonín_Sova|Antonín_Sova|  free verse, and  |Jiří_Orten|Jiří_Orten|  the  |Czech_alexandrine|Czech_Alexandrine| . Ondřej Hanus wrote a monograph about Czech Sonnets in the first half of the twentieth century.        In the Netherlands  |Pieter_Corneliszoon_Hooft|Pieter_Corneliszoon_Hooft|  wrote sonnets. A famous example is Mijn lief, mijn lief, mijn lief. Some of his poems were translated by  |Edmund_Gosse|Edmund_Gosse| .      More recent sonneteers in Dutch are  |Gerrit_Komrij|Gerrit_Komrij| ,  |Martinus_Nijhoff|Martinus_Nijhoff| , and  |Jan_Kal|Jan_Kal| .                    In English, both the  |English_or_Shakespearean_sonnet|Shakespearean_Sonnet| , and the Italian  |Petrarchan_sonnet|Petrarchan_Sonnet|  are traditionally written in  |iambic_pentameter|Iambic_Pentameter| .     The first known sonnets in English, written by  |Sir_Thomas_Wyatt|Thomas_Wyatt|  and  |Henry_Howard,_Earl_of_Surrey|Henry_Howard,_Earl_Of_Surrey| , used the Italian, Petrarchan form, as did sonnets by later English poets, including  |John_Milton|John_Milton| ,  |Thomas_Gray|Thomas_Gray| ,  |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  and  |Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning|Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning| .     When English sonnets were introduced by  |Thomas_Wyatt|Thomas_Wyatt|  in the early 16th century, his sonnets and those of his contemporary  |the_Earl_of_Surrey|Henry_Howard,_Earl_Of_Surrey|  were chiefly translations from the Italian of  |Petrarch|Petrarch|  and the French of  |Ronsard|Ronsard|  and others. While Wyatt introduced the sonnet into English, it was Surrey who developed the rhyme scheme – ABAB CDCD EFEF GG – which now characterizes the English sonnet. Having previously circulated in manuscripts only, both poets sonnets were first published in  |Richard_Tottels|Richard_Tottel|  Songes and Sonnetts, better known as  Tottels Miscellany  .     It was, however, Sir  |Philip_Sidneys|Philip_Sidney|  sequence  Astrophel and Stella  that started the English vogue for  |sonnet_sequences|Sonnet_Sequence| . The next two decades saw sonnet sequences by  |William_Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare| ,  |Edmund_Spenser|Edmund_Spenser| ,  |Michael_Drayton|Michael_Drayton| ,  |Samuel_Daniel|Samuel_Daniel| ,  |Fulke_Greville|Fulke_Greville,_1St_Baron_Brooke| ,  |William_Drummond_of_Hawthornden|William_Drummond_Of_Hawthornden| , and many others. These sonnets were all essentially inspired by the Petrarchan tradition, and generally treat of the poets love for some woman, with the exception of Shakespeares sequence of 154 sonnets. The form is often named after Shakespeare, not because he was the first to write in this form but because he became its most famous practitioner. The form consists of fourteen lines structured as three quatrains and a couplet. The third quatrain generally introduces an unexpected sharp thematic or imagistic turn , the volta. In Shakespeares sonnets, however, the volta usually comes in the couplet, and usually summarizes the theme of the poem or introduces a fresh new look at the theme. With only a rare exception , the meter is  |iambic_pentameter|Iambic_Pentameter| .     This example, Shakespeares  |Sonnet_116|Sonnet_116|  , illustrates the form :       Let me not to the marriage of true minds   Admit impediments, love is not love   Which alters when it alteration finds,   Or bends with the remover to remove.   O no, it is an ever fixèd mark   That looks on tempests and is never shaken;   It is the star to every wandring bark,   Whose worths unknown although his height be taken.   Loves not times fool, though rosy lips and cheeks   Within his bending sickles compass come,   Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,   But bears it out even to the edge of doom:   :If this be error and upon me proved,   :I never writ, nor no man ever loved.          PRONUNCIATION/RHYME: Note changes in pronunciation since composition.     PRONUNCIATION/METER: Fixed pronounced as two-syllables, fix-ed .    RHYME/METER: Feminine-rhyme-ending, eleven-syllable alternative.      The Prologue to  Romeo and Juliet  is also a sonnet, as is Romeo and Juliets first exchange in Act One, Scene Five, lines 104–117, beginning with If I profane with my unworthiest hand and ending with Then move not while my prayers effect I take . Folgers Edition of Romeo and Juliet The Epilogue to  Henry V  is also in the form of a sonnet.       A variant on the English form is the Spenserian sonnet, named after  |Edmund_Spenser|Edmund_Spenser|  , in which the rhyme scheme is ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. The linked rhymes of his quatrains suggest the linked rhymes of such Italian forms as  |terza_rima|Terza_Rima| . This example is taken from AmorettiHappy ye leaves! whenas those lily hands     Happy ye leaves. whenas those lily hands,   Which hold my life in their dead doing might,   Shall handle you, and hold in loves soft bands,   Like captives trembling at the victors sight.   And happy lines on which, with starry light,   Those lamping eyes will deign sometimes to look,   And read the sorrows of my dying sprite,   Written with tears in hearts close bleeding book.   And happy rhymes! bathed in the sacred brook   Of Helicon, whence she derived is,   When ye behold that angels blessed look,   My souls long lacked food, my heavens bliss.   Leaves, lines, and rhymes seek her to please alone,   Whom if ye please, I care for other none.         In the 17th century, the sonnet was adapted to other purposes, with  |John_Donne|John_Donne|  and  |George_Herbert|George_Herbert|  writing religious sonnets , and  |John_Milton|John_Milton|  using the sonnet as a general meditative poem. Probably Miltons most famous sonnet is  |When_I_Consider_How_My_Light_is_Spent|When_I_Consider_How_My_Light_Is_Spent|  , titled by a later editor On His Blindness . Both the Shakespearean and Petrarchan rhyme schemes were popular throughout this period, as well as many variants.        On His Blindness  by  |Milton|John_Milton| , gives a sense of the Petrarchan rhyme scheme:     When I consider how my light is spent   Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,   And that one talent which is death to hide,   Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent   To serve therewith my Maker, and present   My true account, lest he returning chide;   Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?   I fondly ask; but Patience to prevent   That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need   Either mans work or his own gifts; who best   Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state   Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed   And post oer land and ocean without rest;   They also serve who only stand and wait.            The fashion for the sonnet went out with the  |Restoration|English_Restoration| , and hardly any sonnets were written between 1670 and  |Wordsworths|William_Wordsworth|  time. However, sonnets came back strongly with the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| . Amongst the first to reintroduce the form was  |Charlotte_Smith|Charlotte_Turner_Smith|  with her Elegaic Sonnets, to whom Wordsworth acknowledged a considerable debt. Wordsworth himself wrote hundreds of sonnets, of which amongst the best-known are  |Upon_Westminster_Bridge|Upon_Westminster_Bridge|  ,  |The_world_is_too_much_with_us|The_World_Is_Too_Much_With_Us|  and  |London,_1802|London,_1802|  addressed to Milton; his sonnets were essentially modelled on Miltons.  |Keats|John_Keats|  and  |Shelley|Percy_Bysshe_Shelley|  also wrote major sonnets; Keatss sonnets used formal and rhetorical patterns inspired partly by Shakespeare, and Shelley innovated radically, creating his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet  |Ozymandias|Ozymandias|  . In her later years,  |Felicia_Hemans|Felicia_Hemans|  took up the form in her series Sonnets Devotional and Memorial. Sonnets were written throughout the 19th century, but, apart from  |Elizabeth_Barrett_Brownings|Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning|   Sonnets from the Portuguese  and the sonnets of  |Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti|Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti| , there were few very successful traditional sonnets.  Modern Love  by  |George_Meredith|George_Meredith|  is a collection of fifty 16-line sonnets about the failure of his first marriage.      |Gerard_Manley_Hopkins|Gerard_Manley_Hopkins|  wrote several major sonnets, often in  |sprung_rhythm|Sprung_Rhythm| , such as The Windhover , and also several sonnet variants such as the 10-line  |curtal_sonnet|Curtal_Sonnet|  Pied Beauty and the 24-line  |caudate_sonnet|Caudate_Sonnet|  That Nature is a Heraclitean Fire . Hopkins poetry was, however, not published until 1918. Norman White, Hopkins, Gerard Manley , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. By the end of the 19th century, the sonnet had been adapted into a general-purpose form of great flexibility.       This flexibility was extended even further in the 20th century.      |Anglo-Irish|Anglo-Irish|  poet  |William_Butler_Yeats|William_Butler_Yeats|  wrote the major sonnet  |Leda_and_the_Swan|Leda_And_The_Swan|  , which uses  |half_rhymes|Half_Rhyme| .  |Wilfred_Owens|Wilfred_Owen|  sonnet  |Anthem_for_Doomed_Youth|Anthem_For_Doomed_Youth|  is another sonnet of the early 20th century.  |W._H._Auden|W._H._Auden|  wrote two sonnet sequences and several other sonnets throughout his career, and widened the range of rhyme-schemes used considerably. Auden also wrote one of the first unrhymed sonnets in English, The Secret Agent .  |Robert_Lowell|Robert_Lowell|  wrote five books of unrhymed American sonnets , including his Pulitzer Prize-winning volume The Dolphin . Half-rhymed, unrhymed, and even unmetrical sonnets have been very popular since 1950; perhaps the best works in the genre are  |Seamus_Heaneys|Seamus_Heaney|  Glanmore Sonnets and Clearances, both of which use half rhymes, and  |Geoffrey_Hills|Geoffrey_Hill|  mid-period sequence An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England . The 1990s saw something of a formalist revival, however, and several traditional sonnets have been written in the past decade, including  |Don_Patersons|Don_Paterson|  40 Sonnets .     Contemporary word sonnets combine a variation of styles often considered to be mutually exclusive to separate genres, as demonstrated in works such as An Ode to Mary .             In  |French_poetry|French_Poetry| , sonnets are traditionally composed in the  |French_alexandrine|French_Alexandrine|  line, which consists of twelve syllables with a  |caesura|Caesura|  in the middle.     In the 16th century, around  |Ronsard|Ronsard|  ,  |Joachim_du_Bellay|Joachim_Du_Bellay|  and  |Jean_Antoine_de_Baïf|Jean_Antoine_De_Baïf|  , there formed a group of radical young noble poets of the court , who began writing in, amongst other forms of poetry, the Petrarchan  |sonnet_cycle|Sonnet_Cycle|  . The character of La Pléiade literary program was given in Du Bellays manifesto, the Defense and Illustration of the French Language , which maintained that French  was a worthy language for literary expression and which promulgated a program of linguistic and literary production and purification.     In the aftermath of the  |Wars_of_Religion|Wars_Of_Religion| , French Catholic jurist and poet  |Jean_de_La_Ceppède|Jean_De_La_Ceppède|  published the Theorems, a sequence of more than 500 Alexandrine sonnets, with non-traditional rhyme schemes, about the Passion and Resurrection of  |Jesus_Christ|Jesus_Christ| . Drawing upon the  |Gospels|Gospels| ,  |Greek|Greek_Mythology|  and  |Roman_Mythology|Roman_Mythology| , and the  |Fathers_of_the_Church|Fathers_Of_The_Church| , La Ceppède was praised by  |Saint_Francis_de_Sales|Saint_Francis_De_Sales|  for transforming the Pagan Muses into Christian ones. La Ceppèdes sonnets often attack the  |Calvinist|Calvinist|  doctrine of a judgmental and unforgiving God by focusing on Christs passionate love for the  |human_race|Human_Race| . Long forgotten, the 20th century witnessed a revival of interest in La Ceppède and his sonnets are now regarded as classic works of  |French_poetry|French_Poetry| .     By the late 17th century poets on increasingly relied on stanza forms incorporating rhymed couplets, and by the 18th century fixed-form poems – and, in particular, the sonnet – were largely avoided. The resulting versification – less constrained by meter and rhyme patterns than Renaissance poetry – more closely mirrored prose.   Henri Morier, Dictionnaire de poétique et de rhétorique. Paris: PUF, 1961. p. 385.     The Romantics were responsible for a return to many of the fixed-form poems used during the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as for the creation of new forms. The sonnet however was little used until the  |Parnassians|Parnassianism|  brought it back into favor, Morier, p. 385.  |Vigny|Alfred_De_Vigny|  wrote no sonnets;  |Hugo|Victor_Hugo|  only wrote 3. and the sonnet would subsequently find its most significant practitioner in  |Charles_Baudelaire|Charles_Baudelaire|  .     The traditional French sonnet form was however significantly modified by Baudelaire, who used 32 different forms of sonnet with non-traditional rhyme patterns to great effect in his  Les Fleurs du mal . Monier, pp. 390–393. Morier terms these sonnets faux sonnets, or false sonnets     The French  |Symbolists|Symbolism| , such as  |Paul_Verlaine|Paul_Verlaine|  and  |Stephane_Mallarmé|Stephane_Mallarmé| , also revived the sonnet form.     Paul Verlaines Alexandrine sonnet Langeur, in which he compares himself to, The Empire at the end of its decadence , while drinking in a low dive, was embraced as a manifesto by the  |Decadent_poets|Decadent_Poets|  and by  |literary_bohemia|Bohemianism| .       The sole confirmed surviving sonnet in the  |Occitan_language|Occitan_Language|  is confidently dated to 1284, and is conserved only in troubadour manuscript P, an Italian  |chansonnier|Chansonnier|  of 1310, now XLI.42 in the  |Biblioteca_Laurenziana|Biblioteca_Laurenziana|  in  |Florence|Florence| . Bertoni, 119. It was written by  |Paolo_Lanfranchi_da_Pistoia|Paolo_Lanfranchi_Da_Pistoia|  and is addressed to  |Peter_III_of_Aragon|Peter_Iii_Of_Aragon| . It employs the rhyme scheme ABAB ABAB CDCDCD. This poem is historically interesting for its information on north Italian perspectives concerning the  |War_of_the_Sicilian_Vespers|War_Of_The_Sicilian_Vespers| , the conflict between the  |Angevins|Capetian_House_Of_Anjou|  and  |Aragonese|House_Of_Barcelona|  for  |Sicily|Kingdom_Of_Sicily| . Peter III and the Aragonese cause was popular in northern Italy at the time and Paolos sonnet is a celebration of his victory over the Angevins and  |Capetians|Capetian_Dynasty|  in the  |Aragonese_Crusade|Aragonese_Crusade|      An Occitan sonnet, dated to 1321 and assigned to one William of Almarichi , is found in  |Jean_de_Nostredame|Jean_De_Nostredame|  and cited in  |Giovanni_Mario_Crescimbenis|Giovanni_Mario_Crescimbeni| , Istoria della volgar poesia. It congratulates  |Robert_of_Naples|Robert_Of_Naples|  on his recent victory. Its authenticity is dubious. There are also two poorly regarded sonnets by the Italian  |Dante_de_Maiano|Dante_De_Maiano| .        |Paulus_Melissus|Paulus_Melissus|  was the first to use the sonnet and the  terza rima  in German lyric. In his lifetime he was recognized as an author fully versed in Latin love poetry.         |Germanys|Germany| |national_poet|National_Poet| ,  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe| , also wrote many sonnets, using a rhyme scheme derived from Italian poetry. After his death, Goethes followers created the German sonnet, which is rhymed . a. b. b. a. . . b. c. c. b. . . c. d. d. . . c. d. d.

The Greek poet  |Yannis_Livadas|Yannis_Livadas|  in 1993 invented the so-called fusion sonnet , which first appeared in a poetry collection entitled The Hanging Verses Of Babylon/Οι Κρεμαστοί Στίχοι Της Βαβυλώνας , .        In the Indian subcontinent, sonnets have been written in the Assamese, Bengali, Dogri, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Sindhi and Urdu languages. The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature , 1992, pp. 4140–4146   |Urdu|Urdu|  poets, also influenced by English and other European poets, took to writing sonnets in the Urdu language rather late. Encyclopedic Dictionary of Urdu literature, 2007, p. 565  Azmatullah Khan is believed to have introduced this format to  |Urdu_literature|Urdu_Literature|  in the very early part of the 20th century.

See  |Irish_poetry|Irish_Poetry|    Although sonnets had long been written in English by  |Anglo-Irish|Anglo-Irish|  poets such as  |Edmund_Spenser|Edmund_Spenser|  and  |William_Butler_Yeats|William_Butler_Yeats| , the sonnet form failed to enter poetry in the  |Irish_language|Irish_Language| . This changed, however, in 2009.     In that year, poet  |Muiris_Sionóid|Muiris_Sionóid|  published a complete translation of  |William_Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|  154 sonnets into Irish under the title Rotha Mór an Ghrá .   The Irish Post  March 14, 2018.     In an article about his translations, Sionóid wrote that Irish poetic forms are completely different from those of other languages and that both the sonnet form and the  |iambic_pentameter|Iambic_Pentameter|  line had long been considered entirely unsuitable for composing poetry in Irish. In his translations, Soinóid chose to closely reproduce Shakespeares rhyme scheme and rhythms while rendering into Irish.  by Muiris Sionóid.     In a copy that he gifted to the  |Shakespeare_Birthplace_Trust|Shakespeare_Birthplace_Trust|  in  |Stratford_Upon_Avon|Stratford_Upon_Avon| , Sionóid wrote, From Slaneyside to Avonside, from a land of bards to the greatest Bard of all; and long life and happiness to the guardians of the world’s most precious treasure.          The sonnet was introduced into  |Polish_literature|Polish_Literature|  in the 16th century by  |Jan_Kochanowski|Jan_Kochanowski| , Lucylla Pszczołowska, Wiersz polski. zarys historyczny, Wrocław 1997, p.95 .  |Mikołaj_Sęp-Szarzyński|Mikołaj_Sęp-Szarzyński|  and  |Sebastian_Grabowiecki|Sebastian_Grabowiecki| . Mirosława Hanusiewicz, Świat podzielony. O poezji Sebastiana Grabowieckiego, Lublin 1994, p. 133 .     In 1826, Polands  |national_poet|National_Poet| ,  |Adam_Mickiewicz|Adam_Mickiewicz| , wrote a  |sonnet_sequence|Sonnet_Sequence|  known as the  Crimean Sonnets , after   the Tsar sentenced him to  |internal_exile|Internal_Exile|  in the  |Crimean_Peninsula|Crimean_Peninsula| . Mickiewiczs sonnet sequence focuses heavily on the culture and  |Islam|Islam| ic religion of the  |Crimean_Tatars|Crimean_Tatars| . The sequence was translated into English by  |Edna_Worthley_Underwood|Edna_Worthley_Underwood| . Edna W. Underwood, Sonnets from the Crimea/A biographical sketch Adam Mickiewicz: A Biographical Sketch , in Sonnets from the Crimea, Paul Elder and Company, San Francisco .     Sonnets were also written by  |Adam_Asnyk|Adam_Asnyk| ,  |Jan_Kasprowicz|Jan_Kasprowicz|  and  |Leopold_Staff|Leopold_Staff| . Polish poets usually shape their sonnets according to Italian or French practice. The  |Shakespearean_sonnet|Shakespearean_Sonnet|  is not commonly used. Kasprowicz used a Shelleyan rhyme scheme: ABA BCB CDC DED EE. Text available at: . Polish sonnets are typically written in either hendecasyllables or  |Polish_alexandrines|Polish_Alexandrine|  .        |Alexander_Pushkins|Alexander_Pushkin| |novel_in_verse|Novel_In_Verse|   Eugene Onegin  consists almost entirely of 389  |stanzas|Stanza|  of  |iambic_tetrameter|Iambic_Tetrameter|  with the unusual  |rhyme_scheme|Rhyme_Scheme|   , where the uppercase letters represent  |feminine_rhymes|Feminine_Rhyme|  while the lowercase letters represent  |masculine_rhymes|Masculine_Rhyme| . This form has come to be known as the  |Onegin_stanza|Onegin_Stanza|  or the Pushkin sonnet. .     Unlike other traditional forms, such as the  |Petrarchan_sonnet|Petrarchan_Sonnet|  or  |Shakespearean_sonnet|Shakespearean_Sonnet| , the Onegin stanza does not divide into smaller stanzas of four lines or two in an obvious way. There are many different ways this sonnet can be divided.     In post-Pushkin Russian poetry, the form has been utilized by authors as diverse as  |Mikhail_Lermontov|Mikhail_Lermontov| , the Catholic convert poet  |Vyacheslav_Ivanov|Vyacheslav_Ivanov| ,  |Jurgis_Baltrušaitis|Jurgis_Baltrušaitis|  and  |Valery_Pereleshin|:Ru:Перелешин,_Валерий_Францевич| , in genres ranging from one-stanza lyrical piece to voluminous autobiography. Nevertheless, the Onegin stanza, being easily recognisable, is strongly identified as belonging to Pushkin.      |John_Fullers|John_Fuller|  1980 The Illusionists and  |Jon_Stallworthys|Jon_Stallworthy|  1987 The Nutcracker used this stanza form, and  |Vikram_Seths|Vikram_Seth|  1986 novel  The Golden Gate  is written wholly in Onegin stanzas.          In Slovenia the sonnet became a national verse form. The greatest Slovenian poet,  |France_Prešeren|France_Prešeren| ,  wrote many sonnets. His best known work worldwide is Sonetni venec ,  which is an example of  |crown_of_sonnets|Crown_Of_Sonnets| . Another work of his is the sequence Sonetje nesreče . In writing sonnets Prešeren was followed by many later poets. After the Second World War sonnets remained very popular. Slovenian poets write both traditional rhymed sonnets and modern ones, unrhymed, in free verse. Among them are  |Milan_Jesih|Milan_Jesih|  and  |Aleš_Debeljak|Aleš_Debeljak| . The metre for sonnets in Slovenian poetry is  |iambic_pentameter|Iambic_Pentameter|  with  |feminine_rhymes|Feminine_Rhyme| , based both on the Italian endecasillabo and German iambic pentameter.       According to  |Willis_Barnstone|Willis_Barnstone| , the introduction of the sonnet into  |Spanish_language|Spanish_Language|  poetry began with a chance meeting in 1526 between the Catalan poet  |Juan_Boscán|Juan_Boscán|  and  |Andrea_Navagero|Andrea_Navagero| , the Venetian Ambassador to the Spanish Court. While the Ambassador was accompanying King  |Carlos_V|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  on a state visit to the  |Alhambra|Alhambra| , he encountered Boscán along the banks of the  |Darro_River|Darro_River|  in  |Granada|Granada| . As they talked, Navagero strongly urged Boscán to introduce the sonnet and other Italian forms into  |Spanish_poetry|Spanish_Poetry| . A few days later, Boscán began trying to compose sonnets as he rode home and found the form, of a very capable disposition to receive whatever material, whether grave or subtle or difficult or easy, and in itself good for joining with any style that we find among the approved ancient authors.
