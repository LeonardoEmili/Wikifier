            In the  |mathematical|Mathematics|  field of  |topology|Topology| , a homeomorphism, topological isomorphism, or bicontinuous function is a  |continuous_function|Continuous_Functioncontinuous_Functions_Between_Topological_Spaces|  between  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space|  that has a continuous  |inverse_function|Inverse_Function| . Homeomorphisms are the  |isomorphisms|Isomorphism|  in the  |category_of_topological_spaces|Category_Of_Topological_Spaces|   that is, they are the  |mappings|Map|  that preserve all the  |topological_properties|Topological_Property|  of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are called homeomorphic, and from a topological viewpoint they are the same. The word homeomorphism comes from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  words  ὅμοιος   similar or same and  μορφή   shape, form, introduced to mathematics by  |Henri_Poincaré|Henri_Poincaré|  in 1895.       Very roughly speaking, a topological space is a  |geometric|Geometry|  object, and the homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of the object into a new shape. Thus, a  |square|Square|  and a  |circle|Circle|  are homeomorphic to each other, but a  |sphere|Sphere|  and a  |torus|Torus|  are not. However, this description can be misleading. Some continuous deformations are not homeomorphisms, such as the deformation of a line into a point. Some homeomorphisms are not continuous deformations, such as the homeomorphism between a  |trefoil_knot|Trefoil_Knot|  and a circle.     An often-repeated  |mathematical_joke|Mathematical_Joke|  is that topologists cant tell the difference between a coffee cup and a donut,  since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a cups handle.       A  |function|Function|  f : X   Y between two  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space|  is a homeomorphism if it has the following properties:     f is a  |bijection|Bijection|  ,   f is  |continuous|Continuity| ,   the  |inverse_function|Inverse_Function|  f is continuous .     A homeomorphism is sometimes called a bicontinuous function. If such a function exists, X and Y are homeomorphic. A self-homeomorphism is a homeomorphism from a topological space onto itself. Being homeomorphic is an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation|  on topological spaces. Its  |equivalence_class|Equivalence_Class| es are called homeomorphism classes.         |interval|Interval|  is homeomorphic to the  |real_numbers|Real_Number|    for any a  .
