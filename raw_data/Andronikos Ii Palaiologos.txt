      Andronikos  II Palaiologos , usually  |Latinized|Latinization_Of_Names|  as Andronicus  II Palaeologus, reigned as  |Byzantine_Emperor|List_Of_Byzantine_Emperors|  from 1282 to 1328. Andronikos reign was marked by the beginning of the decline of the Byzantine Empire. During his reign, the Turks conquered most of the Western Anatolian territories of the Empire and, during the last years of his reign, he also had to fight his grandson  |Andronikos|Andronikos_Iii_Palaiologos|  in the  |First_Palaiologan_Civil_War|First_Palaiologan_Civil_War| . The civil war ended in Andronikos  IIs forced abdication in 1328 after which he retired to a monastery.       Andronikos II was born Andronikos Doukas Angelos Komnenos Palaiologos  at  |Nicaea|Nicaea| . He was the eldest surviving son of  |Michael_VIII_Palaiologos|Michael_Viii_Palaiologos|  and  |Theodora_Palaiologina|Theodora_Palaiologina| , grandniece of  |John_III_Doukas_Vatatzes|John_Iii_Doukas_Vatatzes| .     Andronikos was acclaimed co-emperor in 1261, after his father Michael VIII recovered  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  from the  |Latin_Empire|Latin_Empire| , but he was not crowned until 1272. Sole emperor from 1282, Andronikos II immediately repudiated his fathers unpopular Church union with the  |Papacy|Papacy| , which he had been forced to support while his father was still alive, but he was unable to resolve the related schism within the Orthodox clergy until 1310.     Andronikos II was also plagued by economic difficulties. During his reign the value of the Byzantine  hyperpyron  depreciated precipitously, while the state treasury accumulated less than one seventh the revenue that it had previously. Seeking to increase revenue and reduce expenses, Andronikos II raised taxes, reduced tax exemptions, and dismantled the Byzantine fleet in 1285, thereby making the Empire increasingly dependent on the rival republics of  |Venice|Republic_Of_Venice|  and  |Genoa|Republic_Of_Genoa| . In 1291, he hired 50–60 Genoese ships, but the Byzantine weakness resulting from the lack of a navy became painfully apparent in the two wars with Venice in  |1296–1302|Byzantine–Venetian_War|  and  |1306–10|Byzantine–Venetian_War| . Later, in 1320, he tried to resurrect the navy by constructing 20 galleys, but failed.     Andronikos II Palaiologos sought to resolve some of the problems facing the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire|  through diplomacy. After the death of his first wife Anne of Hungary, he married  |Yolanda_of_Montferrat|Irene_Of_Montferrat| , putting an end to the Montferrat claim to the  |Kingdom_of_Thessalonica|Kingdom_Of_Thessalonica| . Andronikos II also attempted to marry off his son and co-emperor  |Michael_IX_Palaiologos|Michael_Ix_Palaiologos|  to the Latin Empress  |Catherine_I_of_Courtenay|Catherine_I_Of_Courtenay| , thus seeking to eliminate Western agitation for a restoration of the Latin Empire. Another marriage alliance attempted to resolve the potential conflict with  |Serbia|Serbia|  in  |Macedonia|Macedonia| , as Andronikos II married off his five-year-old daughter  |Simonis|Simonida|  to King  |Stefan_Milutin|Stefan_Milutin|  in 1298.          In spite of the resolution of problems in  |Europe|Europe| , Andronikos II was faced with the collapse of the Byzantine frontier in  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor| , despite the successful, but short, governorships of  |Alexios_Philanthropenos|Alexios_Philanthropenos|  and  |John_Tarchaneiotes|John_Tarchaneiotes| . The successful military victories in Asia Minor by  |Alexios_Philanthropenos|Alexios_Philanthropenos|  and  |John_Tarchaneiotes|John_Tarchaneiotes|  against the Turks were largely dependent on a considerable military contingent of Cretan escapees, or exiles from Venetian-occupied Crete, headed by Hortatzis, whom  |Michael_VIII|Michael_Viii|  had repatriated to Byzantium through a treaty agreement with the Venetians ratified in 1277.

Andronikos II had resettled those Cretans in the region of Meander river, the southeastern Asia Minor frontier of Byzantium with the Turks.     After the failure of the co-emperor Michael IX to stem the Turkish advance in Asia Minor in 1302 and the disastrous  |Battle_of_Bapheus|Battle_Of_Bapheus| , the Byzantine government hired the  |Catalan_Company|Catalan_Company|  of  |Almogavars|Almogavars|   led by  |Roger_de_Flor|Roger_De_Flor|  to clear Byzantine Asia Minor of the enemy. In spite of some successes, the Catalans were unable to secure lasting gains. Being more ruthless and savage than the enemy they intended to subdue they quarreled with Michael IX, and eventually openly turned on their Byzantine employers after the murder of Roger de Flor in 1305; together with a party of willing Turks they devastated  |Thrace|Thrace| , Macedonia, and  |Thessaly|Thessaly|  on their road to Latin occupied southern Greece. There they conquered the  |Duchy_of_Athens|Duchy_Of_Athens|  and  |Thebes|Thebes,_Greece| . The Turks continued to penetrate the Byzantine possessions, and  |Prusa|Bursa,_Turkey|  fell in 1326. By the end of Andronikos IIs reign, much of Bithynia was in the hands of the  |Ottoman_Turks|Ottoman_Turks|  of Osman I and his son and heir  |Orhan|Orhan_I| .  Also,  |Karasids|Karasids|  conquered  |Mysia|Mysia| -region with  |Paleokastron|Balıkesir|  after 1296, Germiyan conquered  |Simav|Simav|  in 1328, Saruhan captured  |Magnesia|Manisa|  in 1313, and  |Aydinids|Aydinids|  captured  |Smyrna|İZmir|  in 1310.          The Empires problems were exploited by  |Theodore_Svetoslav_of_Bulgaria|Theodore_Svetoslav_Of_Bulgaria| , who defeated Michael IX and conquered much of northeastern Thrace in . The conflict ended with yet another dynastic marriage, between Michael IXs daughter Theodora and the Bulgarian emperor. The dissolute behavior of Michael IXs son  |Andronikos_III_Palaiologos|Andronikos_Iii_Palaiologos|  led to a rift in the family, and after Michael IXs death in 1320, Andronikos II disowned his grandson, prompting a  |civil_war|First_Palaiologan_Civil_War|  that raged, with interruptions, until 1328. The conflict precipitated Bulgarian involvement, and  |Michael_Asen_III_of_Bulgaria|Michael_Shishman_Of_Bulgaria|  attempted to capture Andronikos II under the guise of sending him military support. In 1328 Andronikos III entered Constantinople in triumph and Andronikos II was forced to abdicate.     Andronikos II died as a monk at Constantinople in 1332.       On 8 November 1273 Andronikos II married as his first wife  |Anna_of_Hungary|Anna_Of_Hungary| , daughter of  |Stephen_V_of_Hungary|Stephen_V_Of_Hungary|  and  |Elizabeth_the_Cuman|Elizabeth_The_Cuman| , with whom he had two sons:    |Michael_IX_Palaiologos|Michael_Ix_Palaiologos|  .    |Constantine_Palaiologos|Constantine_Palaiologos| ,  despotes  . Constantine was forced to become a monk by his nephew  |Andronikos_III_Palaiologos|Andronikos_Iii_Palaiologos| .     Anna died in 1281, and in 1284 Andronikos married  |Yolanda|Irene_Of_Montferrat| , a daughter of  |William_VII_of_Montferrat|William_Vii_Of_Montferrat| , with whom he had:    |John_Palaiologos|John_Palaiologos|  , despotes.

Maria, who married  |Toqta|Toqta| , Khan of the  |Golden_Horde|Golden_Horde| .
