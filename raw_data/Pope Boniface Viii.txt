     Pope Boniface VIII  was  |pope|Pope|  from 24 December 1294 to his death in 1303. Caetani was of  |baronial|Baronial|  origin with family connections to the papacy.   He succeeded  |Pope_Celestine_V|Pope_Celestine_V| , a  |Benedictine|Benedictine| , who had  |resigned|Papal_Resignation|  from the papal throne. Boniface spent his early career abroad in diplomatic roles. In the  |College_of_Cardinals|College_Of_Cardinals| , he discriminated not only against the Benedictines but also members of the Colonna family, some of whom had contested the validity of the  |1294_papal_conclave|1294_Papal_Conclave|  that elected him following the unusual resignation of Pope Celestine V. The dispute resulted in battles between troops of Boniface and his adversaries and the deliberate destruction and  |salting|Salting_The_Earth|  of the town of  |Palestrina|Palestrina| , despite the popes assurances that the surrendering city would be spared.     Boniface VIII put forward some of the strongest claims of any pope to temporal as well as spiritual power. He involved himself often with foreign affairs, including in France, Sicily, Italy and the  |First_War_of_Scottish_Independence|First_War_Of_Scottish_Independence| . These views, and his chronic intervention in temporal affairs, led to many bitter quarrels with  |Albert_I_of_Germany|Albert_I_Of_Germany| ,  |Philip_IV_of_France|Philip_Iv_Of_France| , and  |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri| , who wrote his treatise  De Monarchia  to dispute Bonifaces claims of papal supremacy and placed the pope in the Eighth Circle of Hell in his  Divine Comedy , among the  |simoniacs|Simony| .     Boniface systematized  |canon_law|Canon_Law|  by collecting it in a new volume, Liber Sextus , which continues to be important source material for canon lawyers. He organized the first Catholic  |jubilee|Jubilee|  year to take place in  |Rome|Rome|  in order to gain political clout over Philip IV of France or make up for loss of funds from him. Boniface had first entered into conflict with Philip IV of France in 1296 when the latter sought to reinforce the nascent  |nation_state|Nation_State|  by imposing taxes on the clergy and barring them from administration of the law. The conflict escalated when the French arrested and convicted papal legate  |Bernard_Saisset|Bernard_Saisset|  for insurrection. The pope issued a bull,  Ausculta Fili , in which he declared that both spiritual and temporal power were under the popes jurisdiction, and that kings were subordinate to the power of the Roman pontiff. Philip disobeyed and had Ausculta Fili publicly burnt in Paris in 1302. Boniface  |excommunicated|Excommunication|  Philip and all others who prevented French clergy from traveling to the  |Holy_See|Holy_See| , after which the king sent his troops to attack the popes residence in  |Anagni|Anagni|  on 7 September 1303 and capture him. Boniface was held for three days and beaten badly.     Boniface died a month later, on 11 October 1303, of high fever and was buried in a special chapel. Philip IV pressured  |Pope_Clement_V|Pope_Clement_V|  of the  |Avignon_Papacy|Avignon_Papacy|  into staging a  |posthumous_trial|Posthumous_Trial|  of Boniface. He was accused of heresy and  |sodomy|Sodomy| . Pope Clement V referred the process to the 1311  |Council_of_Vienne|Council_Of_Vienne| , where two knights challenged the claim to a  |trial_by_combat|Trial_By_Combat| . With no one willing to fight them, the Council declared the matter closed. His body was accidentally exhumed in 1605 and was found to be in relatively good condition, dispensing the legend that he had become frenzied, gnawing his hands and bashing his brains out against the wall.         Benedetto Caetani was born in  |Anagni|Anagni| , some  southeast of  |Rome|Rome| . He was a younger son of Roffredo Caetani , a member of a  |baronial|Baronial|  family of the  |Papal_States|Papal_States| , the  |Caetani|Caetani|  or Gaetani dellAquila. His elder brother, Roffredo or Goffredo, was the first Conte di  |Caserta|Caserta|  from 1288, Signore di Calvi, Vairano e Norma in 1282, Senator of Rome 1290–1292, Signore di Vairano by decree of the  |King_of_Sicily|King_Of_Sicily|  on 1 April 1291,  |Podestà|Podestà|  of  |Todi|Todi|  , Signore di Caserta . He had a younger brother, Giovanni, and three sisters.     Through his mother, Emilia Patrasso di Guarcino, a niece of  |Pope_Alexander_IV|Pope_Alexander_Iv|  , he was not far distant from the seat of ecclesiastical power and patronage. His fathers younger brother, Atenolfo, was  |Podestà|Podestà|  di  |Orvieto|Orvieto| . Finke, p. 9. Tosti, p. 37.       Benedetto took his first steps into religious life when he was sent to the  |monastery|Monastery|  of the  |Friars_Minor|Order_Of_Friars_Minor|  in  |Velletri|Velletri| , where he was put under the care of his maternal uncle Fra Leonardo Patrasso. Tosti, p. 37, citing Teuli, History of Velletri, Book 2, chapter 5. In 1252, when his paternal uncle Pietro Caetani became  |Bishop_of_Todi|Bishop_Of_Todi| , in  |Umbria|Umbria| , Benedetto followed him to  |Todi|Todi|  and began his legal studies there.     He was granted a  |canonry|Canon|  at the cathedral in the familys stronghold of Anagni, with the permission of Pope Alexander IV. His uncle Pietro granted him a canonry in the  |Cathedral_of_Todi|Todi_Cathedral|  in 1260. He also came into possession of the small nearby castello of  |Sismano|Sismano| , a place with twenty-one fires . In later years  |Father_Vitalis|Father_Vitalis| , the Prior of S. Egidio de S. Gemino in Narni testified that he knew him and conversed with him in Todi and that Benedetto was in a school run by  |Rouchetus|Rouchetus| , a Doctor of Laws, from that city. Pierre Dupuy, Histoire du differend dentre le Pape Boniface VIII. et Philippes le Bel, Roy de France , pp. 527-528.     Benedetto never forgot his roots in  |Todi|Todi| , later describing the city as the dwelling place of his early youth , the city which nourished him while still of tender years , and as a place where he held lasting memories . Later in life he repeatedly expressed his gratitude to Anagni, Todi, and his family.     In 1264 Benedetto entered the  |Roman_Curia|Roman_Curia| , perhaps with the office of Advocatus. Ptolemaeus of Lucca Historia ecclesiastica XXIII. 26 . Tosti believed that Caetani held the office of Advocatus before he set out with Cardinal Ottoboni on the English legation. He served as secretary to  |Cardinal|Cardinal|  Simon de Brion, the future  |Pope_Martin_IV|Pope_Martin_Iv| , on a mission to France. Cardinal Simon had been appointed by  |Pope_Urban_IV|Pope_Urban_Iv|  , between 25 and 27 April 1264, to engage in negotiations with  |Charles_of_Anjou|Charles_Of_Anjou| ,  |Comte_de_Provence|Comte_De_Provence| , over the  |Crown_of_Naples_and_Sicily|List_Of_Monarchs_Of_Sicily| . On 1 May 1264 he was given permission to appoint two or three tabelliones for his mission, one of whom was Benedetto. August Potthast, Regesta Pontificum Romanorum II , p. 1543, nos. 18858, 18859, 18867.  |Pope_Urban_IV|Pope_Urban_Iv|  had held a Consistory on 25 April, at which the matter of naming Charles of Anjou as Senator of Rome was discussed. It was after this meeting that Cardinal Simon was given his Legation.     On 26 February 1265, only eleven days after his coronation, the new pope,  |Pope_Clement_IV|Pope_Clement_Iv|  wrote to Cardinal Simon, telling him to break off negotiations and travel immediately to  |Provence|Provence| , where he would receive further instructions. On the same day, Clement wrote to Charles of Anjou, informing him that the pope had 35 conditions that Charles must agree to in accepting the crown; he also wrote to  |Henry_III_of_England|Henry_Iii_Of_England|  and his son Edmund that they had never been possessors of the  |Kingdom_of_Sicily|Kingdom_Of_Sicily| . August Potthast, Regesta Pontificum Romanorum II , p. 1543, nos. 19037-19039. He also commended to the Cardinal the  |Sienese|Republic_Of_Siena|  bankers who had been working for Urban IV to raise funds for Charles of Anjou, and that he should transfer to them some 7,000  |pounds_Tournois|Livre_Tournois|  from the  |decima|Tithe|  of France. On 20 March 1265, in order to expedite the business with Charles of Anjou, Cardinal Simon was authorized to provide  |benefices|Benefices|  from cathedrals or otherwise within his province to five of his clerics. Potthast, no. 19065. These were benefices which in the course of things were in the hands of the Pope. This may have been the occasion on which Benedetto Caetani acquired at least some of his French benefices. On 9 April 1265, on the petition of Cardinal Simon de Brion, the legation which had been assigned him by Pope Urban was declared not to have expired on the death of Urban IV. Potthast, 19089. There would have been no point in making such a ruling if Cardinal Simon had already ceased to be  |Legate|Papal_Legate| .     On 4 May 1265  |Cardinal_Ottobono_Fieschi|Pope_Adrian_V|  was appointed Apostolic Legate to England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland by the new Pope Clement IV. Registres de Clément IV I, nos. 40-78. In fact, he was sent as the successor of Cardinal Guy Folques, who had been elected  |Clement_IV|Clement_Iv|  on 5 February 1265. Fieschi later became  |Pope_Adrian_V|Pope_Adrian_V| , in 1276. Another member of the embassy was Theobaldus of Piacenza, Archdeacon of Liège, who became a friend of Prince Edward, and went on Crusade with him; he later became  |Pope_Gregory_X|Pope_Gregory_X|  in 1272. Francis Gasquet, Henry the Third and the English Church , p. 414. On 29 August 1265 the Cardinal was received at the French Court by  |King_Louis_IX|Louis_Ix_Of_France| . There he learned that  |Simon_de_Montfort|Simon_De_Montfort,_6Th_Earl_Of_Leicester|  and his son Henry had been killed at the  |Battle_of_Evesham|Battle_Of_Evesham|  earlier that month. Cardinal Ottobono did not reach  |Boulogne|Boulogne|  until October 1265. He was accompanied by Benedetto Caetani. This derives from a statement of Pope Clement V in 1309, during the agitation for a posthumous trial of Boniface VIII: A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1309, §4, p. 429. Rose Graham, Letters of Cardinal Ottoboni, English Historical Review 15 87-120. He was in England until July 1268, working to suppress the remnants of Simon de Montforts barons who were still in arms against King Henry III of England. To finance their rebellion, the barons had imposed a 10% tax on church property, which the Pope wanted back because the tithe was uncanonical. This drawback was a major concern of Cardinal Ottobono and his entourage. Francis Gasquet, Henry the Third and the English Church , pp. 403-416. While in England, Benedetto Caetani became rector of  |St._Lawrences_church|St._Lawrences_Church|  in  |Towcester|Towcester| ,  |Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire| .  Tosti, p. 38, n. 15     Upon Benedettos return from England, there is an eight-year period in which nothing is known about his life. This period, however, included the long vacancy of the papal throne from 29 November 1268 to February 1272, when  |Pope_Gregory_X|Pope_Gregory_X|  accepted the papal throne. It also includes the time span when Pope Gregory and his cardinals went to France in 1273 for the second Council of Lyon, as well as the  |Eighth_Crusade|Eighth_Crusade| , led by Louis IX, in 1270. The Pope and some of the cardinals began their return to Italy at the end of November 1275. Pope Gregory celebrated Christmas in  |Arezzo|Arezzo|  and died there on 10 January 1276. In 1276, however, Benedetto was sent to France to supervise the collection of a  |tithe|Tithe| , which is perhaps when he held the office of Advocatus in the Roman Curia, Tosti believed that Caetani held the office of Advocatus before he set out with Cardinal Ottoboni on the English legation. And yet, Ottobono Fieschi was elected Pope Adrian V on 11 July 1276 and died on 18 August 1276. and then was appointed a  |papal_Notary|Notary|  in the late 1270s. During this time, Benedetto accumulated seventeen benefices, which he was permitted to keep when he was promoted. Some of these are enumerated in a  |bull|Papal_Bull|  by Pope Martin IV, in which he bestowed the deaconry of  |S._Nicolas_in_Carcere|San_Nicola_In_Carcere|  on Cardinal Benedetto Caetani. Tosti, p. 38, n. 15: ... . Tosti is wrong in calling Benedetto Caetani a canon of Lyons; he misread Lugdunensi where the text twice has Lingonensi.     At Orvieto, on 12 April 1281,  |Pope_Martin_IV|Pope_Martin_Iv|  created Benedetto Caetani  |cardinal_deacon|Cardinal|  of Saint Nicholas in Carcere.  In 1288 he was sent as Legate to Umbria to attempt to calm the strife between  |Guelphs|Guelphs|  and  |Ghibellines|Ghibellines| , which was taking the form of a war between the cities of  |Perugia|Perugia|  and  |Foligno|Foligno| . R. Morghen, Una legazione di Benedetto Caetani nellUmbria e la guerra tra Perugia e Foligno del 1288, Archivio della Società romana di storia patria, 52 , pp. 485-490. In the winter of 1289, he was one of Pope Nicholas IVs advisors as he decided on a settlement of the disputes over the election or appointment of Portuguese bishops, in which  |King_Denis|King_Denis|  played a major role. To give greater authority to the final mandate of the Pope, Cardinal  |Latino_Orsini_of_Ostia|Latino_Orsini_Of_Ostia| , Cardinal  |Pietro_Peregrosso_of_S._Marco|Pietro_Peregrosso_Of_S._Marco| , and Cardinal Benedetto of S. Nicola in Carcere appended their signatures and seals. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1289, §31, p. 54. This fact is blown out of proportion by some commentators into a Legateship to Portugal. The business, however, was done in Rome, through Procurators of the King of Portugal. The document was signed at S. Maria Maggiore on 12 February 1289 and the ecclesiastical censures against the Portuguese withdrawn in March. Three years later, on 22 September 1291, Conrad Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I edition altera , pp. 10, 47, 52. Pope Nicholas IV promoted him to the Order of  |Cardinal_Priests|Cardinal-Priest| , with the title of SS. Silvester and Martin.  Given the fact that there were only a dozen cardinals, Cardinal Benedetto was assigned the care  of the deaconry of S. Agata, and his old deaconry of S. Nicola in Carcere. It is sometimes said that he also received the Deaconry of S. Agnes, but S. Agnes was not a deaconry or a titulus in the 13th century. As cardinal, he served as  |papal_legate|Papal_Legate|  in diplomatic negotiations to France, Naples, Sicily, and Aragon.             |Pope_Celestine_V|Pope_Celestine_V| |resigned|Papal_Resignation|  on 13 December 1294 at  |Naples|Naples| , where, much to the discomfort of a number of cardinals, he had established the papal court under the patronage of  |Charles_II_of_Naples|Charles_Ii_Of_Naples| . He had continued to live like a monk there, even turning a room in the papal apartment into the semblance of a monastic cell. A contemporary,  |Bartholomew_of_Lucca|Bartholomew_Of_Lucca| , who was present in Naples in December 1294 and witnessed many of the events of the abdication and election, said that Benedetto Caetani was only one of several cardinals who pressured Celestine to resign. Bartholomew of Lucca, in: Odoricus Raynaldus Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus Quartus , sub anno 1294, p. 156: Dominus Benedictus cum aliquibus cardinalibus Caelestino persuasit ut officio cedat quia propter simplicitatem suam, licet sanctus vir, et vitae magni foret exempli, saepius adversis confundabantur ecclesiae in gratiis faciendis et circa regimen orbis. However, it is also on record that Celestine V resigned by his own design after consultation with experts, and that Benedetto merely showed that it was allowed by Church law. Either way, Celestine V vacated the throne and Benedetto Caetani was elected in his place as pope, taking the name Boniface VIII.     The  |1294_papal_conclave|1294_Papal_Conclave|  began on 23 December, ten days after Celestines resignation. The regulations promulgated in the papal bull  Ubi periculum  by Pope Gregory X at the  |Second_Council_of_Lyon|Second_Council_Of_Lyon|  in 1274 had not envisioned a papal resignation, but the cardinals waited the usual ten days from the papal resignation. This gave all twenty-two cardinals the chance to assemble at the Castel Nuovo in Naples, the site of the resignation.  |Hugh_Aycelin|Hugh_Aycelin| , also known as Hughes of  |Billom|Billom|  and Hughes de Billay, of the French province of the  |Dominican_Order|Dominican_Order| , former lector at the studium of  |Santa_Sabina|Santa_Sabina| . Cardinal Hugh had been created a cardinal priest by Pope Nicholas IV on 16 May 1288, with the title of Santa Sabina, and was promoted Cardinal-Bishop of the  |Suburbicarian_Diocese_of_Ostia|Suburbicarian_Diocese_Of_Ostia|  in August 1294 by Celestine V. See Conrad Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I edition altera , pp. 11, 35, 46. presided over the papal conclave as the senior cardinal bishop. Benedetto Caetani was elected by ballot and accession on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1294, taking the name Boniface VIII. On the first ballot, he had a majority of the votes, and at the accessio a sufficient number joined his majority to form the required two-thirds. See the poem by Jacopo Stefaneschi, Subdeacon of the Holy Roman Church, who participated in the events: Ludovicus Antonius Muratori, Rerum Italicarum Scriptores Tomus Tertius , 642. He was consecrated  |bishop|Bishop|  of Rome in Rome by Cardinal Hugh Aycelin on 23 January 1295. Frater Hugo de Bidiliomo provincie Francie, magister fuit egregius in theologia et multum famosus in romana curia; qui actu lector existens apud Sanctam Sabinam, per papam Nicolaum quartum eiusdem ecclesie factus cardinalis postmodum per Celestinum papam est ordinatus in episcopum ostiensem .  Accessed May 9, 2011; see also , p. 275. He immediately returned the Papal Curia to Rome, where he was crowned at the Vatican Basilica on Sunday, 23 January 1295. One of his first acts as pontiff was to grant his predecessor residence in the Castle of Fumone in  |Ferentino|Ferentino| , where he died the next year at the age of 81, attended by two monks of his order. Boniface VIII is occasionally discussed in academic literature as possibly implicated in the demise of his predecessor. Philip Daileader, The Late Middle Ages, The Teaching Company. In 1300, Boniface VIII formalized the custom of the  |Roman_Jubilee|Roman_Jubilee| , which afterwards became a source of both profit and scandal to the church. Boniface VIII founded  |Sapienza_University_of_Rome|Sapienza_University_Of_Rome|  in 1303.  |Filippo_Maria_Renazzi|Filippo_Maria_Renazzi| , Storia dell Universita degli studj di Roma, detto comunamente La Sapienza Volume I , pp. 56-69.          In the field of  |canon_law|Canon_Law|  Boniface VIII had considerable influence. Earlier collections of canon law had been codified in the  Decretales Gregorii IX , published under the authority of  |Pope_Gregory_IX|Pope_Gregory_Ix|  in 1234, but in the succeeding sixty years, numerous legal decisions were made by one pope after another. By Bonifaces time a new and expanded edition was needed. In 1298 Boniface ordered published as a sixth part these various papal decisions, including some 88 of his own legal decisions, as well as a collection of legal principles known as the  Regulæ Juris . Oswald J. Reichel, The Elements of Canon Law , p. 51. His contribution came to be known as the Liber Sextus. Liber Sextus Decretalium D. Bonifacii Papae VIII, suae integritate, una cum Clementinis et Extravagantibus restitutus , pp. 1-272. This material is still of importance to canon lawyers or canonists today, to interpret and analyze the canons and other forms of ecclesiastical law properly. The  Regulae Iuris  appear at the end of the Liber Sextus , Liber Sextus Decretalium D. Bonifacii Papae VIII , pp. 252-260; See  |Regulæ_Juris|Regulæ_Juris|  for a listing. and now published as part of the five Decretales in the  Corpus Juris Canonici . They appear as simple aphorisms, such as Regula VI: Nemo potest ad impossibile obligari. Other systems of law also have their own Regulæ Juris, whether by the same name or something serving a similar function. cf. Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia Christopher Kleinhenz et al. eds. Routledge, 2004, p. 178.       Boniface VIII was a pope who put forward some of the strongest claims of any Pope to temporal as well as spiritual power. He involved himself often with foreign affairs. In his  |Papal_bull|Papal_Bull|  of 1302,  Unam sanctam , Boniface VIII stated that since the Church is one, since the Church is necessary for salvation, and since Christ appointed Peter to lead it, it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff .  These views, and his chronic intervention in temporal affairs, led to many bitter quarrels with  |Albert_I_of_Germany|Albert_I_Of_Germany| ,  |Philip_IV_of_France|Philip_Iv_Of_France| , and  |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri| , who wrote his treatise  De Monarchia  to dispute Bonifaces claims of papal supremacy.     In 1297, Cardinal Jacopo Colonna disinherited his brothers Ottone, Matteo, and Landolfo of their lands. The latter three appealed to Pope Boniface VIII, who ordered Jacopo to return the land and furthermore to hand over the familys strongholds of Colonna,  |Palestrina|Palestrina| , and other towns to the Papacy. Jacopo refused. Jacopo Colonna and his nephew, Pietro Colonna, had also seriously compromised themselves by maintaining highly questionable relations with the political enemies of the pope, James II of Aragon and Frederick III of Sicily. In May, Boniface removed them from the  |College_of_Cardinals|College_Of_Cardinals|  and  |excommunicated|Excommunication|  them and their followers.     The Colonna family declared that Boniface had been elected illegally following the unprecedented abdication of Pope Celestine V. The dispute led to open warfare, and in September Boniface appointed Landolfo to the command of his army to put down the revolt of Landolfos relatives. By the end of 1298 Landolfo had captured Colonna, Palestrina and other towns and razed them to the ground after it surrendered peacefully under Bonifaces assurances that it would be spared. Dante says it was got by treachery by long promises and short performances as Guido of Montefeltro counselled, but this account by the implacable Ghibelline has long since been discredited. Palestrina was razed to the ground, the plough driven through and  |salt_strewn_over_its_ruins|Salting_The_Earth| . A new city — the Città Papale — later replaced it. Only the citys cathedral was spared. The Bad Popes by ER Chamberlin 1969, 1986  Chapter III The Lord of Europe page 102-104.     To deal with the problem of the cardinals left to him by his predecessors, Boniface created new cardinals on five occasions during his reign. Conrad Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I edition altera , pp. 12-13. In the first creation, in 1295, only one cardinal was appointed, the Popes nephew Benedetto Caetano. This was no surprise. Nor was the second creation, on 17 December 1295. Two more relatives were appointed, Francesco Caetano, the son of Boniface VIIIs brother Peter; and Jacopo Tomassi Caetani, OFM, a son of the Popes sister, was made Cardinal Priest of S. Clemente. Giacomo Caetani Stefaneschi, a grand-nephew of Pope Nicholas III, was also appointed, along with Francesco Napoleone Orsini, a nephew of Pope Nicholas III. Three years later, on 4 December 1298, four new cardinals were named: Gonzalo Gudiel , Archbishop of Toledo, was appointed Bishop of Albano; Teodorico Ranieri, Archbishop-elect of Pisa and papal Chamberlain, became Cardinal Priest of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme; Niccolò Boccasini, OP, of Treviso, Master General of the Dominicans, became Cardinal Priest of Santa Sabina; and Riccardo Petroni of Siena, Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, was named a Cardinal Deacon. A pattern begins to emerge, though one sees the pattern only in terms of negatives: of the ten new cardinals, only two are monks, and neither of them  |Benedictine|Benedictine|  ; and there are no Frenchmen . Pope Boniface was distinctly changing the complexion of the membership of the Sacred College. Without the Colonnas, the influence of the King of France was greatly diminished.     On 2 March 1300, during the Great Jubilee, Boniface VIII created three more cardinals. The first was Leonardo Patrasso, Archbishop of Capua, who was Boniface VIIIs uncle; he replaced the Archbishop of Toledo, who had died in 1299, as Cardinal Bishop of Albano. The second was  |Gentile_Partino|Gentile_Portino_Da_Montefiore| , OFM, Doctor of Theology and Lector of Theology in the Roman Curia, who was made Cardinal Priest of S. Martin in montibus. The third was Luca Fieschi, of the Counts of Lavagna, of Genoa, named Cardinal Deacon of S. Maria in Via Lata . A relative, a Franciscan; all three Italians.     In his last Consistory for the promotion of Cardinals, on 15 December 1302, Boniface VIII named two more cardinals:  |Pedro_Rodríguez|Pedro_Rodríguez| , bishop of Burgos, Spain, became Suburbicarian Bishop of Sabina; and Giovanni Minio da Morrovalle , OFM, Minister General of the Franciscans, was appointed Suburbicarian Bishop of Porto. A Franciscan, a Spaniard, no Benedictines, no French. In fact, there were only two French in the Sacred College at Bonifaces death, only five regular clergy .       When  |Frederick_III_of_Sicily|Frederick_Iii_Of_Sicily|  attained his throne after the death of  |Peter_III_of_Aragon|Peter_Iii_Of_Aragon| , Boniface tried to dissuade him from accepting the throne of  |Sicily|Sicily| . When Frederick persisted, Boniface excommunicated him in 1296, and placed the island under  |interdict|Interdict| . Neither the king nor the people were moved.  Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 4 March 2016 The conflict continued until the  |Peace_of_Caltabellotta|Peace_Of_Caltabellotta|  in 1302, which saw Pedros son Frederick III recognized as king of Sicily while  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_Naples|  was recognized as the  |king_of_Naples|List_Of_Monarchs_Of_Naples| . To prepare for a Crusade, Boniface ordered  |Venice|Venice|  and  |Genoa|Genoa|  to sign a truce; they fought each other for three more years, and turned down his offer to mediate peace.     Boniface also placed the city of  |Florence|Florence|  under an interdict and invited the ambitious  |Charles,_Count_of_Valois|Charles,_Count_Of_Valois|  to enter  |Italy|Italy|  in 1300 to end the feud of the  |Black_and_White_Guelphs|Guelphs_And_Ghibellines| , the poet  |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri|  being in the party of the Whites. Bonifaces political ambitions directly affected Dante when the pope invited Count Charles to intervene in the affairs of Florence. Charless intervention allowed the Black Guelphs to overthrow the ruling White Guelphs, whose leaders, including the poet Dante, allegedly in Rome at the time to argue Florences case before Boniface, were sentenced to exile. Dante settled his score with Boniface in the first canticle of the  Divine Comedy , the  Inferno , by damning the pope, placing him within the circles of Fraud, in the  |bolgia|Malebolge|  of the  |simoniacs|Simony| . In the Inferno,  |Pope_Nicholas_III|Pope_Nicholas_Iii| , mistaking the Poet for Boniface, is surprised to see the latter, supposing him to be ahead of his time. Dante Alighierli, Divine Comedy, Inferno, 19.49–63            The conflict between Boniface VIII and King  |Philip_IV_of_France|Philip_Iv_Of_France|  came at a time of expanding  |nation_states|Nation_States|  and the desire for the consolidation of power by the increasingly powerful monarchs. The increase in monarchical power and its conflicts with the Church of Rome were only exacerbated by the rise to power of Philip IV in 1285. In France, the process of centralizing royal power and developing a genuine national state began with the Capetian kings. During his reign, Philip surrounded himself with the best civil lawyers and decidedly expelled the clergy from all participation in the administration of the law. With the clergy beginning to be taxed in France and England to finance their ongoing wars against each other, Boniface took a hard stand against it. He saw the taxation as an assault on traditional clerical rights and ordered the  |bull|Papal_Bull|   Clericis laicos  in February 1296, forbidding lay taxation of the clergy without prior papal approval. In the bull, Boniface states they exact and demand from the same the half,  |tithe|Tithe| , or twentieth, or any other portion or proportion of their revenues or goods; and in many ways they try to bring them into slavery, and subject them to their authority. And also whatsoever emperors, kings, or princes, dukes, earls or barons...presume to take possession of things anywhere deposited in holy buildings...should incur sentence of excommunication. It was during the issuing of Clericis laicos that hostilities between Boniface and Philip began. Philip retaliated against the bull by denying the exportation of money from France to Rome, funds that the Church required to operate. Boniface had no choice but to contest Philips demands, informing Philip that God has set popes over kings and kingdoms.      Philip was convinced that the wealth of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  in  |France|France|  should be used in part to support the state. He wanted to make war against the English. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1296, §17, pp. 188-189; under year 1300, §26, p. 272-273. He countered the  |papal_bull|Papal_Bull|  by decreeing laws prohibiting the export of gold, silver, precious stones, or food from France to the Papal States. These measures had the effect of blocking a main source of papal revenue. Philip also banished from France the papal agents who were raising funds for a new crusade in the Middle East. In the  |bull|Bull|  Ineffabilis amor of September 1296, A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1296, §24-32, pp. 193-196. Boniface retreated. He sanctioned voluntary contributions from the clergy for the necessary defense of the state and gave the king the right to determine that necessity. Philip rescinded his ordinances regarding the exports and even accepted Boniface as arbitrator in a dispute between himself and King  |Edward_I_of_England|Edward_I_Of_England| . Boniface decided most of those issues in Philips favor.          Boniface proclaimed 1300 a  |jubilee|Jubilee|  year, the first of many such jubilees to take place in  |Rome|Rome| . Herbert Thurston, The Holy Year of Jubilee , pp. 6-25. He may have wanted to gather money from pilgrims to Rome Thurston, p. 17. as a substitute for the missing money from France, or it may be that he was seeking moral and political support against the hostile behavior of the French king and his henchmen. The event was a success; Rome had never received such crowds before. It is said that on one particular day some 30,000 people were counted. Jacopo Stefaneschi, Jacobi Sancti Georgii ad Velum aureum diaconi Cardinalis, de centesimo seu iubileo anno Liber, Margarino de la Bigne , Maxima Bibliotheca veterum Patrum et antiquorum scriptorum ecclesiasticorum Tomus 25 , pp. 936-944, at p. 940. Stefaneschi was an eyewitness. Giovanni Villani estimated that some 200,000 pilgrims came to Rome. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1300, §6, p. 264. Boniface and his aides managed the affair well, food was plentiful, and it was sold at moderate prices. It was an advantage to the pope that the great sums of money he collected could be used according to Bonifaces own judgment.       After King  |Edward_I_of_England|Edward_I_Of_England|  invaded Scotland and forced the abdication of the Scottish King  |John_Balliol|John_Balliol| , the deposed King was released into the custody of Pope Boniface on condition that he remain at a papal residence. The hard-pressed Scottish Parliament, then in the early stages of what came to be known as  |First_Scottish_War_of_Independence|First_Scottish_War_Of_Independence| , condemned Edward  Is invasion and occupation of Scotland and appealed to the Pope to assert a feudal overlordship over the country. Geoffrey Barrow, Robert the Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland, , p. 61 The Pope assented, condemning Edwards invasions and occupation of Scotland in the papal bull Scimus, Fili Michael Brown, The Wars of Scotland 1214-1371 , pp. 192, 280 of June 27, 1299. The bull ordered Edward to desist his attacks and start negotiations with the Scots. However, Edward ignored the bull; in 1301,  |a_letter|Barons_Letter_Of_1301|  was composed in which the English rejected its authority, but it was never sent.       The feud between Boniface and Philip IV reached its peak in the early 14th century, when Philip began to launch a strong anti-papal campaign against Boniface. A quarrel arose between Philips aides and a papal legate,  |Bernard_Saisset|Bernard_Saisset| . The legate was arrested on a charge of inciting an insurrection, was tried and convicted by the royal court, and committed to the custody of the archbishop of  |Narbonne|Narbonne| , Giles Aycelin - one of his key ministers and allies, in 1301. In the bull  Ausculta Fili  Boniface VIII appealed to Philip IV to listen modestly to the Vicar of Christ as the spiritual monarch over all earthly kings. He protested against the trial of churchmen before Philips royal courts and the continued use of church funds for state purposes and he announced he would summon the bishops and abbots of France to take measures for the preservation of the liberties of the Church . François Guizot and Mme. Guizot de Witt, History of France from the Earliest Times to 1848 Volume I , p. 474. When the bull was presented to Philip IV,  |Robert_II,_Count_of_Artois|Robert_Ii,_Count_Of_Artois| , reportedly snatched it from the hands of Bonifaces emissary and flung it into the fire. Catholic Encyclopedia. Tosti, History of Pope Boniface VIII, p. 335.     In February 1302 the bull Ausculta Fili was officially burned at Paris before Philip IV and a great multitude. Nonetheless, on 4 March 1302, Pope Boniface sent cardinal  |Jean_Lemoine|Jean_Lemoine|  as his legate to reassert papal control over the French clergy. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1303, §33, p. 325-326. To forestall the ecclesiastical council proposed by Boniface, Philip summoned the three estates of his realm to meet at Paris in April. At this first  |French_Estates-General|Estates_General|  in history, all three classes – nobles, clergy, and commons – wrote separately to Rome in defense of the king and his temporal power. Some forty-five French prelates, despite Philips prohibition, and the confiscation of their property, attended the council at Rome in October 1302. Joannes Dominicus Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima Collectio novissima edition, Tomus vicesimus quintus , pp. 97-100.     Following that council, on 18 November 1302, Boniface issued the bull  Unam sanctam  . A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1302, §13-15, p. 303-304. It declared that both spiritual and temporal power were under the popes jurisdiction, and that kings were subordinate to the power of the Roman pontiff. The Pope also appointed Cardinal Jean le Moine as Apostolic Legate to King Philip, to attempt to find some resolution of the impasse that had developed; he was granted the specific power of absolving King Philip from excommunication. Georges Digard , Les Registres de Boniface VIII , nos. 5041-5069. Cf. no. 5341 , Pope Bonifaces reply to Cardinal Jeans report.          On  |Maundy_Thursday|Maundy_Thursday| , 4 April 1303, the Pope again excommunicated all persons who were impeding French clerics from coming to the Holy See, etiam si imperiali aut regali fulgeant dignitati. Georges Digard , Les Registres de Boniface VIII , no. 5345. ...even if they shone with imperial or royal dignity. This included King Philip IV, though not by name. In response,  |Guillaume_de_Nogaret|Guillaume_De_Nogaret| , Philips chief minister, denounced Boniface as a heretical criminal to the French clergy. On 15 August 1303, the Pope suspended the right of all persons in the Kingdom of France to name anyone as Regent or Doctor, including the King. And in another document of the same day, he reserved to the Holy See the provision of all present and future vacancies in cathedral churches and monasteries, until King Philip should come to the Papal Court and make explanations of his behavior. Georges Digard , Les Registres de Boniface VIII , nos. 5386-5387     On 7 September 1303, an army led by King Philips minister Nogaret and  |Sciarra_Colonna|Sciarra_Colonna|  attacked Boniface at his Palace in Anagni next to the Cathedral. See the extensive narrative of Gregorovius, 588-596. Giuseppe Marchetti Longhi, Il palazzo di Bonifacio VIII in Anagni, Archivio della Società romana di storia patria 43 , 379-410. The building still exists:  The Pope responded with a bull dated 8 September 1303, in which Philip and Nogaret were excommunicated. A. Tomassetti, Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Tomus IV , pp. 170-174. The date of September 8 has caused much scholarly controversy.  Ian Mortimer: Barriers to the Truth History Todayschiaffo di Anagni .     According to a modern interpreter, the 73-year-old Boniface was probably beaten and nearly executed, but was released from captivity after three days. He died a month later. . Reardons narrative does not appear to accord with contemporary sources. The famous Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani, wrote: Giovanni Villani, Historia universalis, Book VIII, chapter 65. R. E. Selfe and P. H. Wicksteed, Selections from the First Nine Books of the Croniche Fiorentine of Giovanni Villani , pp. 346-350.   And when Sciarra and the others, his enemies, came to him, they mocked at him with vile words and arrested him and his household which had remained with him. Among others, William of Nogaret, who had conducted the negotiations for the king of France, scorned him and threatened him, saying that he would take him bound to Lyons on the Rhone, and there in a general council would cause him to be deposed and condemned.... no man dared to touch nor were they pleased to lay hands on him, but they left him robed under light arrest and were minded to rob the treasure of the Pope and the Church. In this pain, shame and torment, the great Pope Boniface abode prisoner among his enemies for three days.... the People of Anagni beholding their error and issuing from their blind ingratitude, suddenly rose in arms... and drove out Sciarra della Colonna and his followers, with loss to them of prisoners and slain, and freed the Pope and his household. Pope Boniface... departed immediately from Anagni with his court and came to Rome and St. Peters to hold a council... but... the grief which had hardened in the heart of Pope Boniface, by reason of the injury which he had received, produced in him, once he had come to Rome, a strange malady so that he gnawed at himself as if he were mad, and in this state he passed from this life on the twelfth day of October in the year of Christ 1303, and in the Church of St. Peter near the entrance of the doors, in a rich chapel which was built in his lifetime, he was honorably buried.     He died of a violent fever on 11 October, in full possession of his senses and in the presence of eight cardinals and the chief members of the papal household, after receiving the sacraments and making the usual profession of faith.       The body of Boniface VIII was buried in 1303 in a special chapel that also housed the remains of  |Pope_Boniface_IV|Pope_Boniface_Iv|  , which had been moved by Boniface VIII from a tomb outside the Vatican Basilica in the portico.     The body was accidentally exhumed in 1605, and the results of the excavation recorded by  |Giacomo_Grimaldi|Giacomo_Grimaldi|  , Apostolic Notary and Archivist of the Vatican Basilica, and others. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1303, §34, pp. 333. A. L. Frothingham, Jr., Procès-verbal by Giacomo Grimaldi of the Opening of the Tomb of Pope Boniface VIII in the Basilica of San Pietro in Vaticano in 1605, American Journal of Archaeology 4 , 330-332. The body lay within three coffins, the outermost of wood, the middle of lead, and the innermost of  |pine|Pine| . The corporal remains were described as being unusually tall measuring seven  |palms|Hand|  when examined by doctors. The body was found quite intact, especially the shapely hands, thus disproving another spiteful calumny, that he had died in a frenzy, gnawing his hands, beating his brains out against the wall. Thomas Oestereich,  The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. Retrieved: 6 February 2018. The body wore ecclesiastical vestments common for Bonifaces lifetime: long stockings covered legs and thighs, and it was garbed also with the  |maniple|Maniple| ,  |cassock|Cassock| , and pontifical habit made of black silk, as well as  |stole|Stole| ,  |chasuble|Chasuble| , rings, and bejeweled gloves. The body was seen several times by the Papal Master of Ceremonies, Giovanni Paolo Mucanzio, who reported the details in his Diary, under 11 October 1605: Joannes Baptista Gattico, Acta Selecta Caeremonialia Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae ex variis mss. codicibus et diariis saeculi xv. xvi. xvii. Tomus I , p. 478-479. The body had been discovered accidentally during the removal of several altars from the old St. Peters to make way for the walls and new chapels of Madernos nave.     After this exhumation and examination, Bonifaces body was moved to the Chapel of Pope Gregory and Andrew. His body now lies in the crypt of St. Peters in a large marble sarcophagus, inscribed BONIFACIVS PAPA VIII. . Her date of 1606 is incorrect.       After the papacy had been removed to  |Avignon|Avignon|  in 1309,  |Pope_Clement_V|Pope_Clement_V| , under extreme pressure from King Philip IV, consented to a  |posthumous_trial|Posthumous_Trial| . He said, was permissible for any persons who wanted to proceed against the memory of Boniface VIII to proceed. He gave a mandate to the Bishop of Paris, Guillaume de Baufet dAurillac, and to Guillaume Pierre Godin, OP, that the complainants should choose prosecutors and determine a day on which the Inquiry would begin in the presence of the Pope . The Pope signed his mandate at his current place of residence, the Priory of Grauselle Gallia christiana I , pp. 919-920. near Malusan in the diocese of Vasio , on 18 October 1309. Both the King of Aragon and the King of Castile immediately sent ambassadors to Pope Clement, complaining that scandal was being poured into the ears of the Faithful, when they heard that a Roman pontiff was being charged with a crime of heresy. Bernardus Guidonis says. ...in publico consistorio pronuntiavit, ut liceret prosequi volentibus procedere contra memoriam Bonifacii papae VIII defuncti. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1309, §4, p. 428. They had a point, in that the persecution implied that a pope was not infallible in matters of faith and morals. Complaints also came from Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands.     On 27 April 1310, in what was certainly a peace gesture toward the French, Clement V pardoned Guillaume Nogaret for his offenses committed at Anagni against Boniface VIII and the Church, for which he had been excommunicated, with the condition that Nogaret personally go to the Holy Land in the next wave of soldiers and serve there in the military. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1311, §50, p. 495. By the end of Spring 1310, Clement was feeling the embarrassment and the pressure over the material being produced by Bonifaces accusers. His patience was wearing thin. He issued a mandate on 28 June 1310, in which he complained about the quality of the testimony and the corruption of the various accusers and witnesses. Then he ordered the Quaesitores that future examinations should proceed under threat of excommunication for perjury. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1310, §37-38, pp. 463-464. A process against the memory of Boniface was held by an ecclesiastical consistory at Priory Groseau, near  |Malaucène|Malaucène| , which held preliminary examinations in August and September 1310. Its records were republished in a critical edition by Jean Coste, Boniface VIII en procès: articles daccusation et dépositions des témoins  . See especially pp. 547-732. and collected testimonies that alleged many heretical opinions of Boniface VIII. This included the offence of  |sodomy|Sodomy| , although there is no substantive evidence for this, and it is likely that this was the standard accusation Philip made against enemies. James Brundage, Law, Sex and Christianity in Medieval Europe , p. 473 The same charge was brought against the Templars.     Before the actual trial could be held, Clement persuaded Philip to leave the question of Bonifaces guilt to the  |Council_of_Vienne|Council_Of_Vienne| , which met in 1311. On 27 April 1311, in a public Consistory, with King Philips agents present, the Pope formally excused the King for everything that he had said against the memory of Pope Boniface, on the grounds that he was speaking with good intentions. This statement was written down and published as a bull, and the bull contained the statement that the matter would be referred by the Pope to the forthcoming Council. The Pope then announced that he was reserving the whole matter to his own judgment. A. Theiner , Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 , under year 1311, §25-30, p. 481-483.     The XV Ecumenical Council, the Council of Vienne, opened on 1 November 1311, with more than 300 bishops in attendance. When the Council met , three cardinals appeared before it and testified to the orthodoxy and morality of the dead pope. Two knights, as challengers, threw down their gauntlets to maintain his innocence by  |trial_by_combat|Trial_By_Combat| . No one accepted the challenge, and the Council declared the matter closed. The Age of Faith, Will Durant, 1950, 13th printing, page 816--but without citing a source. Durants authority is not high. It seems quite unlikely that the Church, especially during an Ecumenical Council, would have acquiesced in a trial for heresy by combat--which was contrary to Church policy. And there is evidence that a legal brief had been prepared by an eminent lawyer of Bologna for a trial of Boniface VIII at the Council: Joannes Dominicus Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima Collectio novissima edition, Tomus vicesimus quintus , pp. 415-426; it is pointed out in several places in the same work that the case of Boniface was presented to the Council by Pope Clement, and that the Council rejected it. Clements order disbanding the Order of the Knights Templar was signed at the Council of Vienne on 2 May 1312.       The pope is said to have been short-tempered, kicking an envoy in the face on one occasion, and on another, throwing ashes in the eyes of an archbishop who was kneeling to receive them as a blessing atop his head.          Inferno ,  |Dante|Dante_Alighieri|  portrayed Boniface VIII as destined for hell, where  |simony|Simony|  is punished, although Boniface was still alive at the fictional date of the poems story. Bonifaces eventual destiny is revealed to Dante by  |Pope_Nicholas_III|Pope_Nicholas_Iii| , whom he meets. A bit later in the Inferno, Dante reminds of the pontiffs feud with the Colonna family, which led him to demolish the city of  |Palestrina|Palestrina| , killing 6,000 citizens and destroying both the home of  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  and a  |shrine_to_Mary|Veneration_Of_Mary_In_The_Catholic_Churh| . Bonifaces ultimate fate is confirmed by Beatrice when Dante visits Heaven. It is notable that he does not adopt Guillaume de Nogarets aspersion that Boniface VIII was a sodomite, however, and does not assign him to that circle of hell .   He is also mentioned in  |François_Rabelaiss|François_Rabelais|   Gargantua and Pantagruel . In the chapter that Epistemos lists the inhabitants of hell and their occupations, he says that Boniface was skimming the scum off soup pots .   The mathematician and astronomer  |Campanus_of_Novara|Campanus_Of_Novara|  served as personal physician or perhaps only as a chaplain to Pope Boniface VIII. Robin Healey, Italian Literature Before 1900 In English Translation: An Annotated Bibliography 1929–2008, page 390 . . He is not listed as a physician of Boniface VIII by Gaetano Marini, Degli archiatri pontificj I , pp. 32-42. Campano died at Viterbo in 1296.   In  |Giovanni_Boccaccios|Giovanni_Boccaccio|   Decameron , Boniface VIII is  |satirically|Satire|  depicted granting a  |highwayman|Highwayman|   a priorate . Earlier , Boniface VIII is also mentioned for his role in sending Charles, Count of Valois to  |Florence|Florence|  in 1300 to end the feud between the Black and White Guelphs.   The Tale of Pope Boniface is told in Book 2 of  |John_Gowers|John_Gower|   Confessio Amantis  as an exemplum of the sin of fraudulently supplanting others. Gower claims that Boniface tricked Pope Celestine V into abdicating by having a young cleric, pretending to be the voice of God, speak to him while he was sleeping and convince him to abdicate . Gower also repeats the rumour that Boniface died by gnawing off his own hands, but attributes it to hunger rather than a deliberate suicide attempt .   Boniface was a patron of  |Giotto|Giotto| .   Boniface had the churches of  |Rome|Rome|  restored for the Great Jubilee of 1300, particularly  |St._Peters_Basilica|Old_St._Peters_Basilica| , the  |Lateran_Basilica|Archbasilica_Of_St._John_Lateran| , and the  |Basilica_of_Santa_Maria_Maggiore|Basilica_Of_Santa_Maria_Maggiore| .   Pope Boniface VIII is a main character played by  |Jim_Carter|Jim_Carter|  in the  |History|History|  Channel television show  Knightfall . Boniface is portrayed as a warm and  |avuncular|Avuncular|.
