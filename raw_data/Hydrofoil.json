Some modern hydrofoils use fully submerged inverted T-shape foils.

Due to the common extreme winds and storms that take place in winter in the Strait of Gibraltar, the service was replaced in 1990 by catamarans, which were also able to carry cars. At the peak of the year, in summer, there was a service every half an hour in each direction.

The higher speed service competed with the traditional ro-ro ferries but allowed easy day trips for pedestrian travellers. They were ultimately replaced with high-speed catamarans that could also carry vehicles and have better seaworthiness; however, the latter ceased operations as the operator filed for bankruptcy in May 2018.           Hydrofoils had their peak in popularity in the 1960s and 70s. Since then there has been a steady decline in their use and popularity for leisure, military and commercial passenger transport use. There are a number of reasons for this:     Hydrofoils are sensitive to impacts with floating objects and marine animals. On hitting something, a hydrofoil boat may fall off the foils, which often creates a perception of increased danger. However, hydrofoils operating in ": null

Simpler designs such as those of Russian design and those by Rodriquez in Italy are more competitive in price and are still being produced today for operation on ferry routes.   It is a very conservative industry. Hydrofoils are still considered exotic by many commercial operators of high-speed craft and many will not risk trying such exotic vessels when they have no experience in operating them.  Those that do have found benefit in their operation.   They are technically complex and require high maintenance, which has put an end to most military hydrofoil projects. The US Navy, for example, developed some of the most technically advanced hydrofoils, but could not make the complex propulsion systems and ride control reliable. This eventually led to the suspension of their hydrofoil projects. Most other Navy developments met the same fate. The Russian Navy still operates very large hydrofoils and have been successful—largely because they opted for simpler systems that might not have the same performance as the US designs but are more robust and reliable.
