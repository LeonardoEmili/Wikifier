Millbridge is a small neighbourhood of  |Plymouth|Plymouth| , on the boundary of what used to be the towns of Plymouth and  |Devonport|Devonport_Devon| , in the  |English|England|  county of  |Devon|Devon| .     What was originally a self-standing village lies to the north of the  |toll_bridge|Toll_Bridge| , originally built by Sir  |Piers_Edgcumbe|Piers_Edgcumbe|  in 1525, that crossed what used to be the  |Deadlake|Deadlake|  or  |Stonehouse_Creek|Stonehouse_Creek| , to the west of  |Pennycomequick|Pennycomequick| , the south of  |Stoke_village|Stoke_Plymouth|  and to the east of Stoke Church. It derives its name from the old toll bridge  across the creek between Eldad Hill and Molesworth Road, at one time the principal link between Plymouth and Devonport. The creek to the east of the bridge was filled in with material from the quarries at  |Cattedown|Cattedown|  and  |Oreston|Oreston|  during the late 1890s and the ground created became a municipal park,  |Victoria_Park|Victoria_Park_Millbridge_Plymouth| , which was officially opened in 1903. The remainder of the creek to the west of Millbridge, up to Stonehouse Bridge and Pool, was filled in and by 1972 the whole area had been developed as rugby pitches. These pitches are often used by Devonport High School for Boys and the Old Boys RFC.
