              Pope Clement XIV , born Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio Ganganelli, was head of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  and ruler of the  |Papal_States|Papal_States|  from 19 May 1769 to his death in 1774. At the time of his election, he was the only  |Franciscan|Franciscan|  friar in the  |College_of_Cardinals|College_Of_Cardinals| . To date, he is the last pope to take the pontifical name of Clement upon his election.     He is best known for his  |suppression_of_the_Society_of_Jesus|Suppression_Of_The_Society_Of_Jesus| .         Ganganelli was born in  |Santarcangelo_di_Romagna|Santarcangelo_Di_Romagna|  in 1705 as the second child of Lorenzo Ganganelli and Angela Serafina Maria Mazza. He received the sacrament of  |baptism|Baptism|  on 2 November 1705.     He initially studied at  |Verucchio|Verucchio|  but later received his education from the  |Society_of_Jesus|Society_Of_Jesus|  at  |Rimini|Rimini|  from 1717. He also studied with the  |Piarists|Piarists|  of  |Urbino|Urbino| . Ganganelli entered the  |Order_of_Friars_Minor_Conventual|Conventual_Franciscan|  on 15 May 1723 in  |Forlì|Forlì|  and he changed his name to Lorenzo Francesco . He did his novitiate in  |Urbino|Urbino|  where his cousin Vincenzo was a  |friar|Friar| . He was professed as a full member of that order on 18 May 1724. He was sent to the convents of  |Pesaro|Pesaro| ,  |Fano|Fano|  and  |Recanati|Recanati|  from 1724 to 1728 where he did his theological studies. He continued his studies in  |Rome|Rome|  under  |Antonio_Lucci|Antonio_Lucci|  and obtained his  |doctorate|Doctorate|  in  |theology|Theology|  in 1731.        He was ordained around this time after he received his doctorate and he taught philosophy and theology for almost a decade in Ascoli, Bologna and Milan. He later returned to Rome as the regent of the college that he studied in and was later elected as the  |Definitor_General|Definitor_Generalis|  of the order in 1741.  In the general chapters of his order in 1753 and 1756, he declined the generalship of his order and some rumored it was due to his desire of a higher office.     Ganganelli became a friend of  |Pope_Benedict_XIV|Pope_Benedict_Xiv| , who in 1758 appointed him to investigate the issue of the traditional blood libel regarding the  |Jews|Jews| , which Ganganelli found to be untrue.          |Pope_Clement_XIII|Pope_Clement_Xiii|  elevated Ganganelli to the cardinalate on 24 September 1759 and appointed him as the  |Cardinal-Priest_of_San_Lorenzo_in_Panisperna|San_Lorenzo_In_Panisperna| . His elevation came at the insistence of  |Lorenzo_Ricci|Lorenzo_Ricci| , who was the  |Superior-General_of_the_Society_of_Jesus|Superior-General_Of_The_Society_Of_Jesus| .     Ganganelli opted to become the  |Cardinal-Priest_of_Ss._XII_Apostoli|Santi_Apostoli,_Rome|  in 1762. In 1768 he was named the ponens of the cause of beatification of  |Juan_de_Palafox_y_Mendoza|Juan_De_Palafox_Y_Mendoza| .              The papal conclave in 1769 was almost completely dominated by the problem of the Society of Jesus. During the previous pontificate, the Jesuits had been expelled from  |Portugal|Portugal|  and from all the courts of the  |House_of_Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon| , which included  |France|France| ,  |Spain|Spain| ,  |Naples|Kingdom_Of_Naples| , and  |Parma|Parma| . In January, 1769, these powers made a formal demand for the dissolution of the Society. Clement XIII had planned a consistory to discuss the matter, but died on February 2, the night before it was to be held.      Now the general  |suppression_of_the_order|Suppression_Of_The_Jesuits|  was urged by the faction called the court cardinals , who were opposed by the diminished pro-Jesuit faction, the Zelanti , who were generally opposed to the encroaching  |secularism|Secularism|  of  |the_Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment| . Much of the early activity was pro forma as the members waited for the arrival of those cardinals who had indicated that they would attend. The conclave had been sitting since 15 February 1769, heavily influenced by the political maneuvers of the ambassadors of Catholic sovereigns who were opposed to the Jesuits.     Some of the pressure was subtle. On March 15, Emperor  |Joseph_II|Joseph_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  visited Rome to join his brother  |Leopold|Leopold_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , the  |Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany|Grand_Duke_Of_Tuscany| , who had arrived on March 6. The next day, after touring St. Peters Basilica, they took advantage of the conclave doors being opened to admit Cardinal Girolamo Spinola to enter as well. They were shown, upon the Emperors request, the ballots, the chalice into which they would be placed, and where they would later be burned. That evening Gaetano Duca Cesarini hosted a party. It was the middle of  |Passion_Week|Passion_Week| .      |King_Louis_XV_of_Frances|Louis_Xv_Of_France|  minister, the  |duc_de_Choiseul|Étienne_François,_Duc_De_Choiseul| , had former experience of Rome as the French ambassador and was Europes most skilled diplomat. When one has a favour to ask of a Pope , he wrote, and one is determined to obtain it, one must ask for two . Choiseuls suggestion was advanced to the other ambassadors and it was that they should press, in addition to the Jesuit issue, territorial claims upon the  |Patrimony_of_Saint_Peter|Patrimony_Of_Saint_Peter| , including the return of  |Avignon|Avignon|  and the  |Comtat_Venaissin|Comtat_Venaissin|  to France, the duchies of  |Benevento|Benevento|  and  |Pontecorvo|Pontecorvo|  to  |Spain|Spain| , an extension of territory adjoining the  |Papal_States|Papal_States|  to  |Naples|Naples| , and an immediate and final settlement of the vexed question of  |Parma|Parma|  and  |Piacenza|Piacenza|  that had occasioned a diplomatic rift between  |Austria|Austria|  and Pope Clement XIII.       By May 18, the court coalition appeared to be unravelling as the respective representatives began to negotiate separately with different cardinals. The French ambassador had earlier suggested that any acceptable candidate be required to put in writing that he would abolish the Jesuits. The idea was largely dismissed as a violation of canon law. Spain still insisted that a firm commitment should be given, though not necessarily in writing. However, such concessions could be immediately nullified by the pope upon election. On 19 May 1769, Cardinal Ganganelli was elected as a compromise candidate largely due to support of the Bourbon courts, which had expected that he would suppress the  |Society_of_Jesus|Society_Of_Jesus| . Ganganelli, who had been educated by Jesuits, gave no commitment, but indicated that he thought the dissolution was possible.  He took the pontifical name of Clement XIV . Ganganelli first received  |episcopal_consecration|Episcopal_Consecration|  in the Vatican on 28 May 1769 by Cardinal Federico Marcello Lante and was crowned as pope on 4 June 1769 by the  |cardinal_protodeacon|Cardinal_Protodeacon| |Alessandro_Albani|Alessandro_Albani| .   He was replaced as Cardinal-Priest by  |Buenaventura_Fernández_de_Córdoba_Spínola|Buenaventura_Fernández_De_Córdoba_Spínola| .              Clement XIVs policies were calculated from the outset to smooth the breaches with the Catholic Crowns that had developed during the previous pontificate. The dispute between the temporal and the spiritual Catholic authorities was perceived as a threat by Church authority, and Clement XIV worked towards reconciliation among the European sovereigns. The arguing and fighting among the monarchs seemed poised to lead Europe towards heavy international competition.     By yielding the Papal claims to  |Parma|Parma| , Clement XIV obtained the restitution of Avignon and Benevento and in general he succeeded in placing the relations of the spiritual and the temporal authorities on a friendlier footing. The pontiff went on to  |suppress_the_Jesuits|Suppression_Of_The_Jesuits| , writing the decree to this effect in November 1772 and signing it on 21 July 1773. This measure, to late 19th-century Catholics, had covered Clement XIVs memory with infamy in his church, and was also quite controversial.     His work was hardly accomplished before Clement XIV, whose usual constitution was quite vigorous, fell into a languishing sickness, generally attributed to poison. No conclusive evidence of poisoning was ever produced. The claims that the Pope was poisoned were denied by those closest to him, and as the Annual Register for 1774 stated, he was over 70 and had been in ill health for some time.            The Jesuits had been expelled from  |Brazil|Brazil|  ,  |Portugal|Portugal|  , France , Spain and its colonies , and  |Parma|Duchy_Of_Parma|  . Though he had to face strong pressure on the part of the ambassadors of the  |Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon|  courts,  |Clement_XIII|Clement_Xiii|  always refused to yield to their demands to have the Society of Jesus suppressed. His successor Clement XIV tried to placate their enemies by treating the Jesuits harshly: he refused to meet the  |Superior_General|Superior_General_Of_The_Society_Of_Jesus| ,  |Lorenzo_Ricci|Lorenzo_Ricci| , ordered them not to receive novices, etc.     The pressure kept building up to the point that Catholic countries were threatening to break away from the Church.  |Clement_XIV|Clement_Xiv|  ultimately yielded  in the name of peace of the Church and to avoid a secession in Europe  and suppressed the Society of Jesus by the brief  Dominus ac Redemptor  of the 21 July 1773.  The Catholic American Quarterly Review, Vol. XIII, 1888. However, in non-Catholic nations, particularly in  |Prussia|Prussia|  and  |Russia|Russia| , where papal authority was not recognized, the order was ignored. It was a result of a series of political moves rather than a theological controversy.           Pope Clement XIV and the customs of the Catholic Church in Rome are described in letters of  |Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|  and of his father  |Leopold_Mozart|Leopold_Mozart| , written from Rome in April and May 1770 during their tour of Italy. Leopold found the upper clergy offensively haughty, but was received, with his son, by the pope, where Wolfgang demonstrated an amazing feat of musical memory. The papal chapel was famous for performing a  Miserere mei, Deus  by the 17th-century composer  |Gregorio_Allegri|Gregorio_Allegri| , whose music was not to be copied outside of the chapel on pain of  |excommunication|Excommunication| . The 14-year-old Wolfgang was able to transcribe the composition in its entirety after a single hearing. Clement made young Mozart a knight of the  |Order_of_the_Golden_Spur|Order_Of_The_Golden_Spur| . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Mozarts Letters, Mozarts Life: Selected Letters, transl. Robert Spaethling, , 17.          Clement XIV elevated sixteen new cardinals into the cardinalate in twelve  |consistories|Papal_Consistory|  including  |Giovanni_Angelo_Braschi|Pope_Pius_Vi| , who would become his immediate successor.     The pope held no canonizations in his pontificate but he beatified a number of individuals.   4 June 1769:  |Francis_Caracciolo|Francis_Caracciolo| |Giuliana_Puricelli|Giuliana_Puricelli|  from  |Busto_Arsizio|Busto_Arsizio| ,  |Bernard_of_Baden|Bernhard_Ii,_Margrave_Of_Baden-Baden|  &  |Catherine_of_Pallanza|Caterina_Moriggi| |Tommaso_Bellacci|Tommaso_Bellacci| |Martyrs_of_Otranto|Martyrs_Of_Otranto| |Paul_Burali_dArezzo|Paul_Burali_Darezzo| |John_dal_Bastone|John_Dal_Bastone| |Pope_Benedict_XI|Pope_Benedict_Xi|     1774:  |Beatrix_of_Este_the_Younger|Saint_Beatrice_Deste|        The last months of his life were embittered by his failures and he seemed always to be in sorrow because of this. On 10 September 1774, he was bedridden and received  |Extreme_Unction|Extreme_Unction|  on 21 September 1774. It is said that St.  |Alphonsus_Liguori|Alphonsus_Liguori|  assisted Clement XIV in his last hours by the gift of  |Bilocation|Bilocation| .     Clement XIV died on 22 September 1774, execrated by the  |Ultramontane|Ultramontane|  party but widely mourned by his subjects for his popular administration of the Papal States. When his body was opened for the autopsy, the doctors ascribed his death to scorbutic and hemorrhoidal dispositions of long standing that were aggravated by excessive labour and the habit of provoking artificial perspiration even in the greatest heat. His  |Neoclassical|Neoclassicism|  style tomb was designed and sculpted by  |Antonio_Canova|Antonio_Canova| , and it is found in the church of  |Santi_Apostoli|Santi_Apostoli,_Rome|  in Rome. To this day, he is best remembered for his suppression of the Jesuits.
