                  The Polish Corridor , also known as the Danzig Corridor, Corridor to the Sea or Gdańsk Corridor, was a territory located in the region of  |Pomerelia|Pomerelia|  , which provided the  |Second_Republic_of_Poland|Second_Republic_Of_Poland|  with access to the  |Baltic_Sea|Baltic_Sea| , thus dividing the bulk of  |Germany|Weimar_Republic|  from the province of  |East_Prussia|East_Prussia| . The  |Free_City_of_Danzig|Free_City_Of_Danzig|   was separate from both Poland and Germany. A similar territory, also occasionally referred to as a corridor, had been connected to the  |Polish_Crown|Polish_Crown|  as part of  |Royal_Prussia|Royal_Prussia|  during the period 1466–1772.

Ayer Publishing 1970         According to German historian  |Hartmut_Boockmann|Hartmut_Boockmann|  the term Corridor was first used by Polish politicians, Hartmut Boockmann, Ostpreussen und Westpreussen, Siedler 2002, p. 401,   while Polish historian  |Grzegorz_Lukomski|Grzegorz_Lukomski|  writes that the word was coined by  |German_nationalist|German_Nationalist|  propaganda of the 1920s.  Internationally the term was used in the English language already as early as March 1919  The New York Times ; March 17, 1919:  and whatever its origins, it became a widespread term in English language usage.

Polish names include korytarz polski and korytarz gdański ; however, reference to the region as a corridor came to be regarded as offensive by interwar Polish diplomats. Among the harshest critics of the term corridor was Polish Foreign Minister  |Józef_Beck|Józef_Beck| , who in his May 5, 1939 speech in  |Sejm|Sejm|  said: I am insisting that the term Pomeranian Voivodeship should be used. The word corridor is an artificial idea, as this land has been Polish for centuries, with a small percentage of German settlers .  Poles would commonly refer to the region as Pomorze Gdańskie  or simply Pomorze , or as województwo pomorskie , which was the administrative name for the region.              In the 10th century, Pomerelia was settled by  |Slavic_Pomeranians|Pomeranians| , ancestors of the  |Kashubians|Kashubians| , who were subdued by  |Boleslaw_I_of_Poland|Boleslaw_I_Of_Poland| . In the 11th century, they created an independent duchy. James Minahan, One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p.375,  In 1116/1121,  |Pomerania|Pomerania|  was again conquered by Poland. In 1138, following the death of Duke  |Bolesław_III|Bolesław_Iii_Wrymouth| , Poland was  |fragmented_into_several_semi-independent_principalities|History_Of_Poland_During_The_Piast_Dynastyfragmentation_Of_The_Realm| . The  |Samborides|Samborides| , principes in  |Pomerelia|Pomerelia| , gradually evolved into independent dukes, who ruled the duchy until 1294. Before Pomerelia regained independence in 1227, W.D. Halsey, L. Shores, Bernard Johnston, Emanuel Friedman, Merit Students Encyclopedia, Macmillan Educational Corporation, 1979, p.195: Pomerelia, independent in 1227 and thereafter their dukes were  |vassals|Vassal|  of Poland and  |Denmark|Denmark| . Since 1308-1309,  |following_succession_wars_between_Poland_and_Brandenburg|Teutonic_Takeover_Of_Danzig| , Pomerelia was subjugated by the  |Monastic_state_of_the_Teutonic_Knights|Monastic_State_Of_The_Teutonic_Knights|  in  |Prussia|Prussia| . In 1466, with the  |second_Peace_of_Thorn|Second_Peace_Of_Thorn| , Pomerelia became part of the  |Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth|  as a part of autonomous  |Royal_Prussia|Royal_Prussia| . After the  |First_Partition_of_Poland|Partitions_Of_Poland|  in 1772 it was annexed by the  |Kingdom_of_Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  and named  |West_Prussia|West_Prussia| , and became a constituent part of the new  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  in 1871. Thus the Polish Corridor was not an entirely new creation: the territory assigned to Poland had been an integral part of Poland prior to 1772, but with a large degree of autonomy.

The thirteenth of Wilsons points was:   : An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant.       The following arguments were behind the creation of the corridor:       Ethnic situation was one of the reasons for returning the area to the restored Poland.

The Danzig dilemma: a study in peacemaking by compromise by John Brown Mason Stanford university press 1946, page 49   The  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  eventually accepted this argument.

Quote:  It is believed that the lesser of these evils is preferable, and that the Corridor and Danzig should be ceded to Poland, as shown on map 6. East Prussia , though territorially cut off from the rest of Germany, could easily be assured railroad transit across the Polish corridor , and has, in addition, excellent communication via Königsberg and the Baltic Sea. In either case a people is asked to entrust large interests to the League of Nations . In the case of Poland they are vital interests; in the case of Germany, aside from Prussian sentiment , they are quite secondary .     In the end, The Inquirys recommendations were implemented only partially: most of  |West_Prussia|West_Prussia|  was given to Poland, but Danzig became a  |Free_City|Free_City_Of_Danzig| .         During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  had forced the  |Imperial_Russian|Russian_Empire|  troops out of  |Congress_Poland|Congress_Poland|  and  |Galicia|Galicia| , as manifested in the  |Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk|Treaty_Of_Brest-Litovsk|  on 3 March 1918.

Also in November,  |the_revolution_in_Germany|German_Revolution_Of_1918–19|  forced the  |Kaisers|Kaiser|  abdication and gave way to the establishment of the  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| .

This led Weimars  |Otto_Landsberg|Otto_Landsberg|  and  |Rudolf_Breitscheid|Rudolf_Breitscheid|  to call for an armed force to secure Germanys remaining eastern territories .

The German author  |Christian_Raitz_von_Frentz|Christian_Raitz_Von_Frentz|  writes that after First World War ended, the Polish government tried to reverse the systematic  |Germanization|Germanization|  from former decades.  |Frederick_the_Great|Frederick_The_Great|   settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of  |Prussia|Prussia|  and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility, which he treated with contempt. Frederick also described Poles as slovenly Polish trash and compared them to the  |Iroquois|Iroquois| .    In fact from Hitler to Hans we find frequent references and Jews as Indians. This, too, was a long standing trope. It can be traced back to Frederick the Great, who likened the slovenly Polish trash in newly reconquered West Prussia to Iroquois.

The Prussians passed laws aiming at Germanisation of the provinces of  |Posen|Province_Of_Posen|  and  |West_Prussia|West_Prussia|  in the late 19th century. The  |Prussian_Settlement_Commission|Prussian_Settlement_Commission|  established a further 154,000 colonists, including locals, in the provinces of Posen and West Prussia before World War I. Military personnel were included in the population census. A number of German civil servants and merchants were introduced to the area, which influenced the population status.     According to Richard Blanke, an American historian of German descent  , 421,029 Germans lived in the area in 1910, making up 42.5% of the population.  Blanke has been criticised by Christian Raitz von Frentz, who has classified his book as part of a series on the subject that has an anti-Polish bias; additionally Polish professor A. Cienciala has described Blankes views as sympathetic to Germany.  In addition to the military personnel included in the population census, a number of German civil-servants and merchants were introduced to the area, which influenced the population mix, according to Andrzej Chwalba. Historia Polski 1795-1918. Andrzej Chwalba. Page 444. By 1921 the proportion of Germans had dropped to 18.8% . Over the next decade, the German population decreased by another 70,000 to a share of 9.6%.   Page 244        German political scientist  |Stefan_Wolff|Stefan_Wolff| , Professor at the  |University_of_Birmingham|University_Of_Birmingham| , says that the actions of Polish state officials after the corridors establishment followed a course of assimilation and oppression . Stefan Wolff, The German Question Since 1919: An Analysis with Key Documents, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p.33,  As a result, a large number of Germans left Poland after 1918: according to Wolff, 800,000 Germans had left Poland by 1923, according to  |Gotthold_Rhode|Gotthold_Rhode| , 575,000 left the former province of Posen and the corridor after the war,  according to Herrmann Rauschning, 800,000 Germans had left between 1918 and 1926, contemporary author Alfons Krysinski estimated 800,000 plus 100,000 from East Upper Silesia, the contemporary German statistics say 592,000 Germans had left by 1921, other Polish scholars say that up to a million Germans left. Polish author  |Władysław_Kulski|Władysław_Kulski|  says that a number of them were civil servants with no roots in the province and around 378,000, and this is to a lesser degree is confirmed by some German sources such as Hermann Rauschning.   Lewis Bernstein Namier raised the question as to whether many of the Germans who left were actually settlers without roots in the area - Namier remarked in 1933 a question must be raised how many of those Germans had originally been planted artificially in that country by the Prussian Government.  Lewis Bernstein Namier - 1969 303     The above-mentioned Richard Blanke, in his book Orphans of Versailles, gives several reasons for the exodus of the German population:     A number of former settlers from the  |Prussian_Settlement_Commission|Prussian_Settlement_Commission|  who settled in the area after 1886 in order to germanise it were in some cases given a month to leave, in other cases they were told to leave at once.   Poland found itself under threat during the  |Polish-Bolshevik_war|Polish-Bolshevik_War|  of 1919-1921, and the German population feared that Bolshevik forces would control Poland. Migration to Germany was a way to avoid conscription and participation in the war.   State-employed Germans such as judges, prosecutors, teachers and officials left as Poland did not renew their employment contracts. German industrial workers also left due to fear of lower-wage  |competition|Competition| . Many Germans had become economically dependent on Prussian state aid as Prussia had fought the Polish problem in its provinces.   Germans refused to accept living in a Polish state. As  |Lewis_Bernstein_Namier|Lewis_Bernstein_Namier|  said: Some Germans undoubtedly left because they would not live under the dominion of a race which they had previously oppressed and despised. In the Margin of History, page 45 Lewis Bernstein Namier -   Germans feared that the Poles would seek reprisals after over a century of harassment and  |discrimination|Discrimination|  by the Prussian and German state against the Polish population.   Social and linguistic isolation: While the population was mixed, only Poles were required to be bilingual. The Germans usually did not learn Polish. When Polish became the only official language in Polish-majority provinces, their situation became difficult. The Poles shunned Germans, which contributed to their isolation.   Lower standards of living. Poland was a much poorer country than Germany.   Former  |Nazi|Nazi|  politician and later opponent  |Hermann_Rauschning|Hermann_Rauschning|  wrote that 10% of Germans were unwilling to remain in Poland regardless of their treatment, and another 10% were workers from other parts of the German Empire with no roots in the region.     Blanke says that official encouragement by the Polish state played a secondary role in the German exodus.   Orphans of Versailles: The Germans in Western Poland, 1918-1939 pages 32-48 Richard Blanke   University Press of Kentucky, 1993 Christian Raitz von Frentz notes that many of the repressive measures were taken by local and regional Polish authorities in defiance of Acts of Parliament and government decrees, which more often than not conformed with the minorities treaty, the  |Geneva_Convention|Geneva_Convention|  and their interpretation by the  |League_council|League_Council|  - though it is also true that some of the central authorities tacitly tolerated local initiatives against the German population. A Lesson Forgotten: Minority Protection Under the League of Nations: The Case of the German Minority in Poland, 1920-193 page 8 LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 1999 While there were demonstrations and protests and occasional violence against Germans, they were at a local level, and officials were quick to point out that they were a backlash against former discrimination against Poles. There were other demonstrations when Germans showed disloyalty during the Polish-Bolshevik war as the  |Red_Army|Red_Army|  announced the return to the pre-war borders of 1914.  Despite popular pressure and occasional local actions, perhaps as many as 80% of Germans emigrated more or less voluntarily.     Helmut Lippelt writes that Germany used the existence of German minority in Poland for political ends and as part of its revisionist demands, which resulted in Polish countermeasures. Polish Prime Minister  |Władysław_Sikorski|Władysław_Sikorski|  stated in 1923 that the de-Germanization of these territories had to be ended by vigorous and quick liquidation of property and eviction of German Optanten so that German nationalists would realise that their view of the temporary state of Polish western border was wrong.         To Lippelt this was partially a reaction to the German claims and partially Polish nationalism, urging to exclude the German element. In turn, anti-Polish prejudice fueled German policy.         In the period leading up to the  |East_Prussian_plebiscite|East_Prussian_Plebiscite|  in July 1920, the Polish authorities tried to prevent traffic through the Corridor, interrupting postal, telegraphic and telephone communication. On March 10, 1920, the British representative on the Marienwerder Plebiscite Commission, H.D. Beaumont, wrote of numerous continuing difficulties being made by Polish officials and added as a result, the ill-will between Polish and German nationalities and the irritation due to Polish intolerance towards the German inhabitants in the Corridor , far worse than any former German intolerance of the Poles, are growing to such an extent that it is impossible to believe the present settlement can have any chance of being permanent.... It can confidently be asserted that not even the most attractive economic advantages would induce any German to vote Polish. If the frontier is unsatisfactory now, it will be far more so when it has to be drawn on this side with no natural line to follow, cutting off Germany from the river bank and within a mile or so of  |Marienwerder|Marienwerder| , which is certain to vote German. I know of no similar frontier created by any treaty.

Connections by train were also possible by sealing the carriages , i.e. passengers were not forced to apply for an official Polish  |visa|Visa|  in their passport; however, the rigorous inspections by the Polish authorities before and after the sealing were strongly feared by the passengers. An impression of the psychological consequences of the train sealing is given through the relevant paragraphs of the booklet Namen, die keiner mehr nennt , authored by the liberal German journalist  |Marion_Dönhoff|Marion_Dönhoff| .     In May 1925 a train, passing through the Corridor on its way to East Prussia, crashed because the spikes had been removed from the tracks for a short distance and the fishplates unbolted. 25 persons, including 12 women and 2 children, were killed, some 30 others were injured.          According to Polish Historian Andrzej Chwalba, during the rule of the  |Kingdom_of_Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  and the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  various means were used to increase the amount of land owned by Germans at the expense of the Polish population. In Prussia, the Polish nobility had its estates confiscated after the Partitions, and handed over to German nobility. Historia Polski 1795-1918. Andrzej Chwalba.

Later, the German Empire bought up land in an attempt to prevent the restoration of a Polish majority in Polish inhabited areas in its eastern provinces.  |Andrzej_Chwalba|Andrzej_Chwalba|  - Historia Polski 1795-1918 page 461-463    |Christian_Raitz_von_Frentz|Christian_Raitz_Von_Frentz|  notes that measures aimed at reversing past Germanization included the liquidation of farms settled by the German government during the war under the 1908 law.     In 1925 the Polish government enacted a land reform program with the aim of expropriating landowners.  While only 39% of the agricultural land in the Corridor was owned by Germans, the first annual list of properties to be reformed included 10,800 hectares from 32 German landowners and 950 hectares from seven Poles. The  |voivode|Voivode|  of Pomorze, Wiktor Lamot, stressed that the part of Pomorze through which the so-called corridor runs must be cleansed of larger German holdings . The coastal region must be settled with a nationally conscious Polish population.... Estates belonging to Germans must be taxed more heavily to encourage them voluntarily to turn over land for settlement. Border counties... particularly a strip of land ten kilometers wide, must be settled with Poles. German estates that lie here must be reduced without concern for their economic value or the views of their owners.     Prominent politicians and members of the German minority were the first to be included on the land reform list and to have their property expropriated.         The creation of the corridor aroused great resentment in Germany, and all post-war German  |Weimar|Weimar_Republic|  governments refused to recognize the eastern borders agreed at Versailles, and refused to follow Germanys acknowledgment of its western borders in the  |Treaty_of_Locarno|Treaty_Of_Locarno|  of 1925 with a similar declaration with respect to its eastern borders.     Institutions in Weimar Germany supported and encouraged German minority organizations in Poland, in part radicalized by the Polish policy towards them, in filing close to 10,000 complaints about violations of minority rights to the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations| .     Poland in 1931 declared her commitment to peace, but pointed out that any attempt to revise its borders would mean war. Additionally, in conversation with U.S. President  |Herbert_Hoover|Herbert_Hoover| , Polish delegate Filipowicz noted that any continued provocations by Germany could tempt the Polish side to invade, in order to settle the issue once and for all. Neal Pease, Poland, the United States, and the Stabilization of Europe, 1919-1933, Oxford University Press US, 1986, p.146,  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party| , led by  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler| , took power in Germany in 1933. Hitler at first ostentatiously pursued a policy of  |rapprochement|Rapprochement|  with Poland, Aristotle A. Kallis, Fascist Ideology: Territory and Expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922-1945, Routledge, 2000, p.144,   culminating in the ten-year  |Polish-German_Non-Aggression_Pact|Polish-German_Non-Aggression_Pact|  of 1934. In the years that followed, Germany placed an emphasis on rearmament, as did Poland and other European powers.   Despite this, the Nazis were able to achieve their immediate goals without provoking armed conflict: in 1938  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  annexed  |Austria|Austria|  and the  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|  after the  |Munich_Agreement|Munich_Agreement| . In October 1938, Germany tried to get Poland to join the  |Anti-Comintern_Pact|Anti-Comintern_Pact| . Poland refused, as the alliance was rapidly becoming a sphere of influence of an increasingly powerful Germany.        Following negotiations with Hitler on the Munich Agreement, British Prime Minister  |Neville_Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain|  reported that, He told me privately, and last night he repeated publicly, that after this  |Sudeten_German|Sudeten_German|  question is settled, that is the end of Germanys territorial claims in Europe .   Almost immediately following the agreement, however, Hitler reneged on it. The Nazis increased their requests for the incorporation of the Free City of Danzig into the Reich, citing the protection of the German majority as a motive.    In November 1938, Danzigs district administrator,  |Albert_Forster|Albert_Forster| , reported to the League of Nations that Hitler had told him Polish frontiers would be guaranteed if the Poles were reasonable like the Czechs. German State Secretary  |Ernst_von_Weizsäcker|Ernst_Von_Weizsäcker|  reaffirmed this alleged guarantee in December 1938.      The situation regarding the Free City and the Polish Corridor created a number of headaches for German and Polish Customs.  The Germans requested the construction of an  |extra-territorial|Extra-Territorial|   Reichsautobahn  freeway  and railway through the Polish Corridor, effectively annexing Polish territory and connecting East Prussia to Danzig and Germany proper, while cutting off Poland from the sea and its main trade route. If Poland agreed, in return they would extend the non-aggression pact for 25 years.     This seemed to conflict with Hitlers plans and with Polands rejection of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and his desire either to isolate or to gain support against the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| .  |Joachim_C._Fest|Joachim_C._Fest| , Hitler, Harcourt Trade, 2002, pp.575-577,   German newspapers in Danzig and Nazi Germany played an important role in inciting nationalist sentiment: headlines buzzed about how Poland was misusing its economic rights in Danzig and German Danzigers were increasingly subjugated to the will of the Polish state. At the same time, Hitler also offered Poland additional territory as an enticement, such as the possible annexation of  |Lithuania|Lithuania| , the  |Memel_Territory|Memel_Territory| ,  |Soviet_Ukraine|Ukrainian_Ssr|  and Czech inhabited lands.     However, Polish leaders continued to fear for the loss of their independence and a fate like that of  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , which had yielded the  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|  to Germany in October 1938, only to be invaded by Germany in March 1939. Some felt that the Danzig question was inextricably tied to the problems in the Polish Corridor and any settlement regarding Danzig would be one step towards the eventual loss of Polands access to the sea. Hitlers credibility outside Germany was very low after the occupation of Czechoslovakia, though some British and French politicians approved of a peaceful revision of the corridors borders.  Ludwig van Mises Institut, Auburn Alabama 2001, p.480     In 1939, Nazi Germany made another attempt to renegotiate the status of Danzig;  |EDWIN_L._JAMES|Edwin_Leland_James| ,  The New York Times  May 7, 1939, Sunday, Section: The Week In Review, Page E3  Poland was to retain a permanent right to use the seaport if the route through the Polish Corridor was to be constructed.  However, the Polish administration distrusted Hitler and saw the plan as a threat to Polish sovereignty, practically subordinating Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc while reducing the country to a state of near-servitude as its entire trade would be dependent on Germany.         |Robert_Coulondre|Robert_Coulondre| , the French ambassador in Berlin in a dispatch to the Foreign Minister  |Georges_Bonnet|Georges_Bonnet|  wrote on 30 April 1939 that Hitler sought: ...a mortgage on Polish foreign policy, while itself retaining complete liberty of action allowing the conclusion of political agreements with other countries. In these circumstances, the new settlement proposed by Germany, which would link the questions of Danzig and of the passage across the Corridor with counterbalancing questions of a political nature, would only serve to aggravate this mortgage and practically subordinate Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc. Warsaw refused this in order to retain its independence.       Hitler used the issue of the status city as pretext for attacking Poland, while explaining during a high level meeting of German military officials in May 1939 that his real goal is obtaining  Lebensraum  for Germany, isolating Poles from their Allies in the West and afterwards attacking Poland, thus avoiding the repeat of the Czech situation.

Nevertheless, at midnight on August 29,  |Joachim_von_Ribbentrop|Joachim_Von_Ribbentrop|  handed British Ambassador Sir  |Neville_Henderson|Neville_Henderson|  a list of terms that would allegedly ensure peace in regard to Poland. Danzig was to return to Germany and there was to be a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor; Poles who had been born or had settled there since 1919 would have no vote, while all Germans born but not living there would. An exchange of minority populations between the two countries was proposed. If Poland accepted these terms, Germany would agree to the British offer of an international guarantee, which would include the Soviet Union. A Polish  |plenipotentiary|Plenipotentiary| , with full powers, was to arrive in Berlin and accept these terms by noon the next day. The British Cabinet viewed the terms as reasonable, except the demand for a Polish Plenipotentiary, which was seen as similar to Czechoslovak President  |Emil_Hácha|Emil_Hácha|  accepting Hitlers terms in mid-March 1939.     When Ambassador  |Józef_Lipski|Józef_Lipski|  went to see Ribbentrop on August 30, he was presented with Hitler’s demands. However, he did not have the full power to sign and Ribbentrop ended the meeting. News was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germanys offer.       On September 1, 1939,  |Germany_invaded_Poland|Invasion_Of_Poland|  German forces defeated the Polish  |Pomorze_Army|Pomorze_Army| , which had been tasked with the defense of this region, and captured the corridor during the  |Battle_of_Tuchola_Forest|Battle_Of_Tuchola_Forest|  by September 5. Other notable battles took place at  |Westerplatte|Battle_Of_Westerplatte| , the  |Polish_post_office_in_Danzig|Defense_Of_The_Polish_Post_Office_In_Danzig| ,  |Oksywie|Battle_Of_Oksywie| , and  |Hel|Battle_Of_Hel| .       Most of the area was inhabited by  |Poles|Poles| ,  |Germans|Germans| , and  |Kashubians|Kashubians| . The census of 1910 showed that there were 528,000 Poles compared to 385,000 Germans in the region. The census included German soldiers stationed in the area as well as public officials sent to administer the area.   Since 1886, a  |Settlement_Commission|Prussian_Settlement_Commission|  was set up by  |Prussia|Prussia|  to enforce German settlement Andrzej Chwalba - Historia Polski 1795-1918 page 461 while at the same time Poles, Jews and Germans migrated west during the  |Ostflucht|Ostflucht| .    In 1921 the proportion of Germans in Pomerania was 18.8% . Over the next decade, the German population decreased by another 70,000 to a share of 9.6%. There was also a  |Jew|Jew| ish minority. in 1905, Kashubians numbered about 72,500. Otto Büsch, Ilja Mieck, Wolfgang Neugebauer, Handbuch der preussischen Geschichte, p.42   After the occupation by Nazi Germany, a census was made by the German authorities in December 1939. 71% of people declared themselves as Poles, 188,000 people declared Kashubian as their language, 100,000 of those declared themselves Polish.                   At the 1945  |Potsdam_Conference|Potsdam_Conference|  following the German defeat in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , Polands borders were reorganized at the insistence of the Soviet Union, which occupied the entire area. Territories east of the  |Oder-Neisse_line|Oder-Neisse_Line| , including Danzig, were put under Polish administration. The  |Potsdam_Conference|Potsdam_Conference|  did not debate about the future of the territories that were part of western Poland before the war, including the corridor. It automatically became part of the reborn state in 1945.     German residents were expelled to the  |Soviet_occupation_zone|Soviet_Occupation_Zone| , which later became  |East_Germany|East_Germany| .
