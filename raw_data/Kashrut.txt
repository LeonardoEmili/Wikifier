           Kashrut  is a set of  |dietary_laws|Food_And_Drink_Prohibitions|  dealing with the foods that Jews are permitted to eat and how those foods must be prepared according to  |Jewish_law|Halakha| . Food that may be consumed is deemed kosher , from the  |Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi_Hebrew|  pronunciation of the  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language|  term kashér , meaning fit .     Although the details of the laws of kashrut are numerous and complex, they rest on a few basic principles:   Only certain types of animals, birds and fish  |meeting_specific_criteria|Kosher_Animals|  are kosher; the consumption of the flesh of any animals that do not meet these criteria, such as  |pork|Pork|  and  |shellfish|Shellfish| , is forbidden   Kosher mammals and birds must be slaughtered according to a process known as  shechita ; blood may never be consumed and it must be removed from meat by a process of salting and soaking in water for the meat to be permissible for use   Meat and milk and their derivatives  |may_never_be_mixed|Milk_And_Meat_In_Jewish_Law| , and separate equipment for the storage and preparation of meat-based and dairy-based foods must be used     Every food that is considered kosher is also categorized as follows:   Meat products  are those that contain kosher meat, such as beef, bison or lamb, or kosher poultry such as chicken, goose, duck or turkey, or derivatives of meat, such as animal gelatin; non-animal products that were processed on equipment used for meat or meat-derived products must also be considered as meat    Dairy products  contain milk or any derivatives of milk such as butter or cheese; non-dairy products that were processed on equipment used for milk or milk-derived products must also be considered as milk     Parev  products contain neither meat nor milk or their derivative ingredients, and include foods such as fish, eggs, grains and produce; they remain parev if they are not mixed with or processed using equipment that is used for any meat or dairy products.     While any produce that grows from the earth, such as fruits, grains, vegetables and mushrooms, are always permissible, laws regarding the status of certain agricultural produce, especially that grown in the  |Land_of_Israel|Land_Of_Israel| , such as  |tithes|Tithes_In_Judaism|  and produce of the  |Sabbatical_year|Shemitta| , impact their permissibility for consumption.     Most of the basic laws of kashrut are derived from the  |Torahs|Torah|  books of  |Leviticus|Leviticus|  and  |Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy| . Their details and practical application, however, are set down in the  |oral_law|Oral_Law|   and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, some suggest that they are only tests of obedience, Maimonides,  Guide for the Perplexed  , Part III , New York 1956, p. 311 while others have suggested philosophical, practical and hygienic reasons. Maimonides,  Guide for the Perplexed  , Part III , New York 1956, p. 371  |Rashbam|Rashbam| , commentary to Leviticus 11:3  |Sefer_ha_Chinuch|Sefer_Ha_Chinuch| , commandments 73 and 148     Over the past century, many  |kashrut_certification_agencies|Kosher_Certification_Agency|  have started to certify products, manufacturers and restaurants as kosher, usually authorizing the use of a proprietary symbol called a  hechsher  on products, or issuing a certificate, also called a hechsher, to be displayed by the food establishment, to indicate their approval that they are in compliance with the kosher laws.            |Jewish_philosophy|Jewish_Philosophy|  divides the  |613_commandments|613_Commandments|   into three groups—laws that have a rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies , laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torahs command , and laws that do not have a rational explanation . Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of Gods authority, and man must obey without asking why. , December 1998  However,  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.  Mishneh Torah   Korban ot,  Temurah 4:13      Some theologians have said that the laws of kashrut are symbolic in character: Kosher animals represent  |virtues|Virtue| , while non-kosher animals represent  |vices|Vice| . The 1st-century BCE  |Letter_of_Aristeas|Letter_Of_Aristeas|  argues that the laws have been given  ... to awake pious thoughts and to form the character . Letter of Aristeas, 145–154 This view reappears in the work of the 19th century  |Rabbi|Rabbi| |_Samson_Raphael_Hirsch|Samson_Raphael_Hirsch| .      The Torah prohibits seething the kid in its mothers milk . While the Bible does not provide a reason, it has been suggested that the practice was perceived as cruel and insensitive.  quoting  |Deuteronomy_Rabbah|Deuteronomy_Rabbah|  6:1       |Hasidic_Judaism|Hasidic_Judaism|  believes that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with  |Divinity|God| , the activation of which it sees as helping the  |Divine_Presence|Shechinah|  to be drawn into the physical world;  Hasidism argues that the food laws are related to the way such channels, termed sparks of holiness, interact with various animals. These sparks of Holiness are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a holy reason ;  however, not all animal products are capable of releasing their sparks of holiness.  The Hasidic argument is that animals are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks, and the signs are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually clean and ritually unclean. , rabbifriedman.org .     According to Christian theologian  |Gordon_J_Wenham|Gordon_Wenham| , the purpose of kashrut was to help Jews maintain a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; he says that the effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Gordon J. Wenham, The Theology of Unclean Food,  The Evangelical Quarterly  53, January March 1981, pp.6–15 Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.       There have been attempts to provide empirical support for the view that Jewish food laws have an overarching health benefit or purpose. One of the earliest is that of  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  in  The Guide for the Perplexed . In 1953,  |David_Macht|David_Macht| , an Orthodox Jew and proponent of the theory of biblical scientific foresight, conducted  |toxicity|Toxin|  experiments on many kinds of animals and fish.  His experiment involved  |lupin|Lupin|  seedlings being supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals; Macht reported that in 100% of cases, extracts from ritually unclean meat inhibited the seedlings growth more than that from ritually clean meats.  op. cit. At the same time, these explanations are controversial. Scholar  |Lester_L_Grabbe|Lester_L_Grabbe| , writing in the Oxford Bible Commentary on Leviticus, says explanation now almost universally rejected is that the laws in this section  have hygiene as their basis. Although some of the laws of ritual purity roughly correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness, many of them have little to do with hygiene. For example, there is no evidence that the unclean animals are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a Mediterranean climate, as is sometimes asserted. The Oxford Bible Commentary, eds. J. Barton and J. Muddiman. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2001: 99.                 The laws of kashrut can be classified according to the origin of the prohibition and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture of foods.      Biblically prohibited foods include:    |Non_kosher_animals_and_birds|Kosher_Animals|   mammals require certain identifying characteristics , while birds require a tradition that they can be consumed. Fish require scales and fins . All  |invertebrates|Invertebrates|  are non-kosher apart from certain types of locust, on which most communities lack a clear tradition. No  |reptiles|Reptiles|  or  |amphibians|Amphibians|  are kosher.   Carrion  shechita . This prohibition includes animals that have been slaughtered by non-Jews.  |Babylonian_Talmud|Babylonian_Talmud| , Hullin 13a .   Injured  |liver|Liver| , which is very rich in blood.   Particular fats  nikkur .   The twisted nerve  |sciatic_nerve|Sciatic_Nerve| , as according to Genesis 32:32 the patriarch  |Jacobs|Jacob|  was damaged when he fought with an angel, may not be eaten and is removed by nikkur.   A limb of a living animal  According to Jewish law, God forbade  |Noah_and_his_descendants|Noahide_Laws|  to consume flesh torn from a live animal. Hence, Jewish law considers this prohibition applicable even to non-Jews,  and therefore, a Jew may not give or sell such meat to a non-Jew.   Untithed food  |Land_of_Israel|Land_Of_Israel|  requires the removal of certain  |tithes|Tithe| , which in ancient times were given to the  |Kohanim|Kohen|  ,  |Levites|Levite|  and the poor  or taken to the  |Old_City_of_Jerusalem|Old_City|  to be eaten there .   Fruit during the first three years  fruit from a tree in the first three years after planting may not be consumed . This applies also to the fruit of the vine—grapes, and wine produced from them.    New grain  the Bible prohibits newly grown grain  until the second day of Passover; there is debate as to whether this law applies to grain grown outside the Land of Israel.   Wine of libation       other non-kosher foods are permitted for non-dietary use , but Jews are forbidden to benefit from mixtures of meat and milk in any way.    Different species of plants grown together kilei ha-kerem, the prohibition of planting any grain or vegetable near a  |grapevine|Grapevine| ; this law applies to Jews throughout the world, and a Jew may not derive benefit from such produce.     Rabbinically prohibited foods include:   Non-Jewish milk  |rennet|Rennet| .   Non-Jewish wine  |intermarriage|Interfaith_Marriage_In_Judaism| .   Non-Jewish bread  |fish|Fish|  and meat.             Only meat from particular species is permissible. Mammals that both chew their cud  and have  |cloven_hooves|Cloven_Hoof|  can be kosher. Animals with one characteristic but not the other  are specifically excluded.  Shulchan Aruch ,  Yoreh Deah  79 For a comprehensive review of the issue involving the difficulty that neither the hyrax nor the hare are ruminants, see . In 2008, a rabbinical ruling determined that  |giraffes|Giraffes|  and their  |milk|Milk|  are eligible to be considered kosher. The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud, characteristics of animals considered kosher. Findings from 2008 show that giraffe milk curdles, meeting kosher standards. Although kosher, the giraffe is not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly. Giraffes are difficult to restrain, and their use for food could cause the species to become endangered.  Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 82:1–5      Non-kosher birds are listed outright  but the exact zoological references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds . The  |Mishnah|Mishnah|   Bavli   Chullin  3:22–23 refers to four signs provided by the  |sages|Chazal| .  First, a dores is not kosher. Additionally, kosher birds possess three physical characteristics: an extra toe in the back , a zefek , and a korkoban  with a peelable  |lumen|Lumen| . However, individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition  is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even if it can be substantiated that they meet all four criteria. The only exception to this is the turkey. There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs sufficient, so Jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses all the signs  in Hebrew.      Fish must have fins and scales to be kosher.   |Shellfish|Shellfish|  and other non-fish water animals  |fauna|Fauna|  are not kosher. Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 83 and 84  Insects are not kosher, except for certain species of  |kosher_locust|Kosher_Locust| . Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 85 Generally, any animal that eats other animals, whether they kill their food or eat  |carrion|Carrion| ,  is not kosher, as well as any animal that has been partially eaten by other animals.                Meat and milk may not be mixed  in the sense that meat and  |dairy_products|Dairy_Product|  are not served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together. Observant Jews have separate sets of dishes, and sometimes different kitchens, for meat and milk, and wait anywhere between one and six hours after eating meat before consuming milk products. Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 87 et seq The milchig and fleishig  utensils and dishes are the commonly referred to Yiddish delineations between dairy and meat ones, respectively.                Mammals and fowl must be slaughtered by a trained individual  using a special method of slaughter,  shechita .  Among other features, shechita slaughter severs the  |jugular_vein|Jugular_Vein| ,  |carotid_artery|Carotid_Artery| ,  |esophagus|Esophagus| , and  |trachea|Vertebrate_Trachea|  in a single continuous cutting movement with an unserrated, sharp  |knife|Shechitathe_Knife| . Failure of any of these criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable. The body of the slaughtered animal must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would make the meat unsuitable. Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 1–65 These conditions  include 70 different categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non-kosher. It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such as certain fats  and the  |sciatic_nerves|Sciatic_Nerve|  from the legs, the process of  |excision|Nikkur|  being done by experts before the meat is sold. As much blood as possible must be removed  through the kashering process; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat, but the  |liver|Liver| , as it is rich in blood, is grilled over an open flame. Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 66–78 Fish must be killed before being eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law.    |Legal_aspects_of_ritual_slaughter|Legal_Aspects_Of_Ritual_Slaughter|  are governed not only by Jewish law but civil law as well.       When an animal is ritually slaughtered  the raw meat is traditionally cut, rinsed and salted, prior to cooking. Salting of raw meat draws out the blood that lodges on the inner surface of the meat. Salting is made with any coarse grain of  |salt|Kosher_Salt| , while the meat is laid over a grating or  |colander|Colander|  to allow for drainage, and where the salt is allowed to remain on the meat for the duration of time that it takes to walk one  |biblical_mile|Biblical_Mile| |_Shulhan_Arukh|Shulhan_Arukh| , Yoreh Deah § 69:6; ibid., § 69:16–19 . Afterward, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked. Meat that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire acts as a natural purgatory of blood.     A late Commentary on the  |Shulchan_Arukh|Shulchan_Arukh|  known as the  Taz  , on Yoreh Deah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be very thick when salting. Shulhan Arukh, Yoreh Deah, § 69:5 The  |Yemenite_Jewish|Yemenite_Jewish|  practice, however, follows Rabbi  |Saadiah_Gaon|Saadiah_Gaon|  who required that the meat not be larger than half a rotal when salting.  This allows the effects of the salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah , “blanching.”  |Maimonides|Maimonides| ,  Mishne Torah  ; cf. Babylonian Talmud, Hullin 111a. This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent it from oozing out when the meat was eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of boiling water for as long as it takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he could simply scoop out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.            Utensils used for non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even otherwise kosher food prepared with them non-kosher. Some such utensils, depending on the material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing kosher food again by immersion in boiling water or by the application of a blowtorch. Food prepared in a manner that violates the  Shabbat  may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over. Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 318:1             |Passover|Passover|  has stricter dietary rules, the most important of which is the prohibition on eating  |leavened_bread|Leavened_Bread|  or derivatives of this, which are known as  chametz . This prohibition is derived from Exodus 12:15.  Utensils used in preparing and serving chametz are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been ritually cleansed . Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 431–452 Observant Jews often keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for Passover use only. In addition, some groups follow various eating restrictions on Passover that go beyond the rules of kashrut, such as not eating  gebrochts   or  |garlic|Garlic| .        Biblical rules also control the use of agriculture produce, for example, with respect to their tithing, or when it is permitted to eat them or to harvest them, and what must be done to make them suitable for human consumption. For produce grown in the  |Land_of_Israel|Land_Of_Israel|  a modified version of the biblical  |tithes|Tithe|  must be applied, including  Terumat HaMaaser ,  Maaser Rishon ,  Maaser Sheni , and  Maasar Ani  ; the fruit of the first three years of a trees growth or replanting are forbidden for eating or any other use as  orlah ;  produce grown in the Land of Israel on the seventh year obtains kdushat shviit, and unless managed carefully is forbidden as a violation of the  Shmita  . Some rules of kashrut are subject to different rabbinical opinions. For example, many hold that the rule against eating  chadash  before the 16th of the month  |Nisan|Nisan|  does not apply outside the Land of Israel.           Many vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods acquire a  hechsher , certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of  bishul Yisrael .  Vegetables such as  |spinach|Spinach|  and  |cauliflower|Cauliflower|  must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.           A Pareve  food is one which is neither meat nor dairy. Fish fall into this category, as well as any food which is not animal-derived.      |Eggs|Egg|  are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.      Some processes convert a meat or dairy derived product into a pareve one. For example,  |rennet|Rennet|  is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese. The rennet must be kosher, either microbial or from special productions of animal rennet using kosher calf stomachs. , Retrieved August 10, 2005. Gelatins derived from kosher animal sources are also pareve.  Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as  |agar_agar|Agar_Agar|  and  |carrageenan|Carrageenan|  are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin, like all kosher fish products, is pareve.     Jewish law generally requires that bread be kept parve .      Kashrut has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non-kosher or meat/dairy use, but those may be inadequate for vegetarians, those with allergies, or adherents to other religious statutes. For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it but someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue. That is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry milk warnings.             If  |smoked|Cannabis_Smoking| , under normal circumstances there is no reason  |cannabis|Cannabis|  would not be kosher, although some rabbis apply this only to  |medical_cannabis|Medical_Cannabis| , not  |recreational_usage|Recreational_Drug_Use| . However, this is excepting that smoking it typically involves lighting a spark, so it would not be appropriate for example after sundown on  |Shabbat|Shabbat| . If cannabis is eaten , as  |cannabis_edibles|Cannabis_Edible|  are, on the other hand, the issue is not as clear cut, as there may be small insects inside which are not kosher. For the observant it is recommended to only use brands that are certified as kosher. For cannabis grown in Israel, the plants must observe  shmittah , but this does not apply to cannabis from elsewhere.             Though it is not a food product, some tobacco receives a year-long Kosher certification. This year long certification means that the tobacco is certified also for Passover where different restrictions may be in place. Tobacco may, for example, come into contact with some  chametz  grains that are strictly forbidden during Passover and the certification is a guarantee that it is free from this type of contamination. In Israel this certification is given by a private kashrut rabbinic group  |Beit_Yosef|Badatz_Beit_Yosef| , but Chief Rabbinate has objected to granting of any certification by rabbis because of health risks from tobacco.        With the advent of  |genetic_engineering|Genetic_Engineering| , a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and scholars in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first  |genetically_modified_animal|Genetically_Modified_Animal|  approved by the FDA for human consumption is the  |AquAdvantage_salmon|Aquadvantage_Salmon| , and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a  |gene|Gene|  from a nonkosher organism.     In 2015, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the  |Rabbinical_Assembly|Rabbinical_Assembly|  released a document regarding genetically modified organisms, stating that modification of gene sequences via the introduction of foreign DNA in order to convey a specific capability in the new organism is allowable, that entirely new species should not be intentionally created, and that the health implications of genetically modified foods must be considered on an individual basis. Nevins, Rabbi David S. 10 November 2015.  .  Rabbinical Assembly .     Some put forth that this intermixing of species is against the teachings of the  |Talmud|Talmud|  and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene accounts for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher.         Hashgacha |grape_wine|Kosher_Wine| , Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 114 certain cooked foods , Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 113  |cheese|Cheese|  , and according to some also butter ; Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 115 dairy products ; Many rely on lenient rulings by Rabbi  |Moshe_Feinstein|Moshe_Feinstein|  in Teshuvot Igrot Moshe, Yoreh Deah 1:47 and other 20th century rabbinic authorities who rule that strict government supervision prevents the admixture of non-kosher milk, making supervision unnecessary. See  and  |bread|Bread|  . Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 112, Orach Chayim 603                Although reading the label of food products can identify obviously non-kosher ingredients, some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of certain ingredients. Such hidden ingredients may include  |lubricants|Lubricant|  and  |flavorings|Flavoring| , among other  |additives|Food_Additive| ; in some cases, for instance, the use of natural flavorings, these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non-kosher substances.  Furthermore, certain products, such as fish, have a high rate of  |mislabeling|Seafood_Mislabelling| , which may result in a non-kosher fish being sold in a package labeled as a species of kosher fish.      Producers of foods and food additives can contact Jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as kosherkosher a certificate would be issued.      Manufacturers sometimes identify the products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known in Judaism as  hechsher im.  Due to differences in kashrut standards held by different organizations, the hechsheirim of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities.  The  |certification_marks|Certification_Mark|  of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list, but one of the most commonly used in the United States of America is that of the  |Union_of_Orthodox_Congregations|Union_Of_Orthodox_Congregations| , who use a U inside a circle , symbolising the initials of Orthodox Union. In Britain, a commonly used symbol is the KLBD logo of the  |London_Beth_Din|London_Beth_Din| . A single K is sometimes used as a symbol for kosher, but since many countries do not allow letters to be  |trademark|Trademark| ed , it only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher.      Many of the certification symbols are accompanied by additional letters or words to indicate the category of the product, according to Jewish law; the categorisation may conflict with legal classifications, especially in the case of food that Jewish law regards as dairy, but legal classification does not.   D—Dairy   DE—Dairy equipment   M—Meat, including  |poultry|Poultry| |_Passover|Passover| -related      In many cases constant supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may cease to be so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing  |tallow|Tallow| , which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often coordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organization, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active  |grapevine|Grapevine|  among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products.      Products labeled  |kosher_style|Kosher_Style|  are non-kosher products that have characteristics of kosher foods, such as all-beef  |hot_dogs|Hot_Dog| ,  or are flavored or prepared in a manner consistent with  |Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi|  practices, like  |dill_pickles|Dill_Pickles| .  The designation usually refers to  |delicatessen|Delicatessen|  items.          Food producers often look to expand their markets or marketing potential, and offering kosher food has become a way to do that. The uniqueness of kosher food was advertised as early as 1849.  In 1911  |Procter_Gamble|Procter_Gamble|  became the first company to advertise one of their products, Crisco, as kosher.      Over the next two decades, companies such as  |Lenders_Bagels|Lenders_Bagels| ,  |Maxwell_House|Maxwell_House| ,  |Manischewitz|Manischewitz| , and  |Empire|Empire_Kosher|  evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf-space. In the 1960s,  |Hebrew_National|Hebrew_National|  hotdogs launched a we answer to a higher authority campaign to appeal to Jews and non-Jews alike. From that point on, kosher became a symbol for both quality and value. The kosher market quickly expanded, and with it more opportunities for kosher products. Menachem Lubinsky, founder of the  |Kosherfest|Kosherfest|  trade fair, estimates as many as  kosher consumers and  in sales of kosher products in the USA.        In 2014 the  |Israeli_Defense_Forces|Israeli_Defense_Forces|  decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases, and the first women kosher inspectors were   certified in Israel.              Advertising standards laws in many jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase kosher in a products labeling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the use of the term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.            In the United States, the cost of certification for mass-produced items is typically minuscule,   and is usually more than offset by the advantages of being certified. In 1975  The New York Times  estimated the cost per item for obtaining kosher certification at 6.5 millionths of a cent per item for a  |General_Foods|General_Foods|  frozen-food item. According to a 2005 report by Burns & McDonnell, most US national certifying agencies are non-profit, only charging for supervision and on-site work, for which the on-site supervisor typically makes less per visit than an auto mechanic does per hour . However, re-engineering an existing manufacturing process can be costly.  Certification usually leads to increased revenues by opening up additional markets to  |Jews|Jew|  who keep kosher,  |Muslims|Muslim|  who keep  |halal|Halal| ,  |Seventh_day_Adventists|Seventh_Day_Adventists|  who keep the main laws of Kosher Diet,  |vegetarians|Vegetarianism| , and the  |lactose_intolerant|Lactose_Intolerant|  who wish to avoid dairy products .     According to the  |Orthodox_Union|Orthodox_Union| , one of the largest kashrut organizations in the United States, when positioned next to a competing non-kosher brand, a kosher product will do better by 20% .      In some European communities there is a special tax imposed on the purchase of kosher meat to help support the communitys educational institutions.
