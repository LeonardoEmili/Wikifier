A naturalistic planned language is a  |constructed_language|Constructed_Language|  specifically devised to reproduce the commonalities in morphology and vocabulary from a group of closely related languages, usually with the idea that such a language will be relatively easier to use passively -- in many cases, without prior study -- by speakers of one or more languages in the group.     The term is most commonly used to apply to pan- |Romance|Romance_Languages|  planned languages, though there have also been a few pan- |Germanic|Germanic_Languages| , pan- |Slavic|Slavic_Languages|  and even pan- |Celtic|Celtic_Languages|  naturalistic planned languages.     Since the creation of such a language often includes shared idiosyncrasies from the source languages, active use seems to be generally more difficult to learn than for  |schematic_planned_languages|Schematic_Planned_Language| , though because of grammatical simplification considerably easier than for ethnic languages of the same type.     The best known languages of this type are  |Occidental|Occidental_Language|  and  |Interlingua|Interlingua| . These two also are designed as  |international_auxiliary_languages|International_Auxiliary_Language| .
