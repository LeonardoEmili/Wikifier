           A supernova  is a powerful and luminous stellar  |explosion|Explosion| . This  |transient_astronomical_event|Transient_Astronomical_Event|  occurs during the last  |evolutionary_stages|Stellar_Evolution|  of a  |massive_star|Massive_Star|  or when a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf|  is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a  |neutron_star|Neutron_Star|  or  |black_hole|Black_Hole| , or it is completely destroyed. The peak optical  |luminosity|Luminosity|  of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire  |galaxy|Galaxy| , before fading over several weeks or months.     Supernovae are more energetic than  |novae|Nova| . In  |Latin|Latin_Language| , nova means new , referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star. Adding the prefix super- distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. The word supernova was coined by  |Walter_Baade|Walter_Baade|  and  |Fritz_Zwicky|Fritz_Zwicky|  in 1931.     Only three naked-eye supernova events have been observed in the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  during the last thousand years. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was  |Keplers_Supernova|Keplers_Supernova|  in 1604, but the  |remnants|Supernova_Remnant|  of more recent supernovae have been found. Observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the Milky Way on average about three times every century. These supernovae would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was  |SN_1987A|Sn_1987A| , the explosion of a  |blue_supergiant_star|Blue_Supergiant_Star|  in the  |Large_Magellanic_Cloud|Large_Magellanic_Cloud| , a satellite of the Milky Way.     Theoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of  |nuclear_fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  in a  |degenerate_star|Compact_Star| ; or the sudden  |gravitational_collapse|Gravitational_Collapse|  of a massive stars  |core|Stellar_Core| . In the first class of events, the objects temperature is raised enough to trigger  |runaway|Thermal_Runaway|  nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. Possible causes are an accumulation of material from a  |binary_companion|Binary_Star|  through  |accretion|Accretion|  or a  |stellar_merger|Stellar_Merger| . In the massive star case, the core of a  |massive_star|Stellar_Evolutionmassive_Stars|  may undergo sudden collapse, releasing  |gravitational_potential_energy|Gravitational_Potential_Energy|  as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.     Supernovae can expel several  |solar_mass|Solar_Mass| es of material at speeds up to several percent of the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light| . This drives an expanding  |shock_wave|Shock_Wave|  into the surrounding  |interstellar_medium|Interstellar_Medium| , sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a  |supernova_remnant|Supernova_Remnant| . Supernovae are a major source of  |elements|Chemical_Element|  in the interstellar medium from  |oxygen|Oxygen|  through to  |rubidium|Rubidium| . The expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the  |formation_of_new_stars|Star_Formation| . Supernova remnants might be a major source of  |cosmic_rays|Cosmic_Ray| . Supernovae might produce  |gravitational_waves|Gravitational_Wave| , though, thus far, gravitational waves have only been detected from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars.               Before the development of the  |telescope|Telescope| , only five supernovae were recorded. Compared to a stars entire history, the visual appearance of a galactic supernova is very brief, perhaps spanning several months, so that the chances of observing one is roughly once in a lifetime. Only a tiny fraction of the 100 billion stars in a typical  |galaxy|Galaxy|  have the capacity to become a supernova, restricted to either those having large mass or extraordinarily rare kinds of  |binary_stars|Binary_Star|  containing  |white_dwarfs|White_Dwarf| .        The earliest possible recorded supernova, known as HB9, could have been viewed and recorded by unknown  |India|India| n observers in .  Later,  |SN_185|Sn_185|  was viewed by  |Chinese_astronomers|Chinese_Astronomy|  in 185 AD. The brightest recorded supernova was  |SN_1006|Sn_1006| , which occurred in 1006 AD and was described by observers across China, Japan, Iraq, Egypt, and Europe.          The widely observed supernova  |SN_1054|Sn_1054|  produced the  |Crab_Nebula|Crab_Nebula| . Supernovae  |SN_1572|Sn_1572|  and  |SN_1604|Sn_1604| , the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the  |Aristotelian|Aristotle|  idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging.     |Johannes_Kepler|Johannes_Kepler|  began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later.    It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation .        There is some evidence that the youngest galactic supernova,  |G1_9_0_3|G1_9_0_3| , occurred in the late 19th century, considerably more recently than  |Cassiopeia_A|Cassiopeia_A|  from around 1680.    Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is less clear. Infrared  |light_echos|Light_Echo|  have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high  |extinction|Extinction| .        Observation and discovery of extragalactic supernovae are now far more common. The first such observation was of  |SN_1885A|Sn_1885A|  in the  |Andromeda_Galaxy|Andromeda_Galaxy| . Today, amateur and professional astronomers are finding several hundred every year, some when near maximum brightness, others on old astronomical photographs or plates. American astronomers  |Rudolph_Minkowski|Rudolph_Minkowski|  and  |Fritz_Zwicky|Fritz_Zwicky|  developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in 1941.    During the 1960s, astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernovae could be used as  |standard_candles|Standard_Candles| , hence indicators of astronomical distances.    Some of the most distant supernovae observed in 2003, appeared dimmer than expected. This supports the view that the expansion of the  |universe_is_accelerating|Accelerating_Universe| .    Techniques were developed for reconstructing supernovae events that have no written records of being observed. The date of the  |Cassiopeia_A|Cassiopeia_A|  supernova event was determined from  |light_echo|Light_Echo| es off  |nebulae|Nebula| ,    while the age of supernova remnant  |RX_J0852_0_4622|Rx_J0852_0_4622|  was estimated from temperature measurements    and the  |gamma_ray|Gamma_Ray|  emissions from the radioactive decay of  |titanium_44|Titanium_44| .             The most luminous supernova ever recorded is  |ASASSN_15lh|Asassn_15Lh| . It was first detected in June 2015 and peaked at , which is twice the  |bolometric_luminosity|Bolometric_Luminosity|  of any other known supernova.    However, the nature of this supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations have been suggested, e.g. tidal disruption of a star by a black hole.        Among the earliest detected since time of detonation, and for which the earliest spectra have been obtained , is the Type II  |SN_2013fs|Sn_2013Fs|  which was recorded 3 hours after the supernova event on 6 October 2013 by the  |Intermediate_Palomar_Transient_Factory|Palomar_Transient_Factory|  . The star is located in a  |spiral_galaxy|Spiral_Galaxy|  named  |NGC_7610|Ngc_7610| , 160 million light years away in the constellation of Pegasus.           On 20 September 2016, amateur astronomer Victor Buso from  |Rosario|Rosario| ,  |Argentina|Argentina|  was testing his telescope.       When taking several photographs of galaxy  |NGC_613|Ngc_613| , Buso chanced upon a supernova that had just become visible on Earth. After examining the images he contacted the Instituto de Astrofísica de La Plata. It was the first time anyone had ever captured the initial moments of the “shock breakout” from an optical supernova, one not associated with a gamma-ray or X-ray burst. The odds of capturing such an event were put between one in ten million to one in a hundred million, according to astronomer Melina Bersten from the Instituto de Astrofísica.   The supernova Buso observed was a Type IIb made by a star twenty times the mass of the sun. Astronomer  |Alex_Filippenko|Alex_Filippenko| , from the  |University_of_California|University_Of_California| , remarked that professional astronomers had been searching for such an event for a long time. He stated: Observations of stars in the first moments they begin exploding provide information that cannot be directly obtained in any other way.               Early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of  |novae|Nova|  was performed during the 1920s. These were variously called upper-class Novae , Hauptnovae , or giant novae .  The name supernovae is thought to have been coined by  |Walter_Baade|Walter_Baade|  and  |Fritz_Zwicky|Fritz_Zwicky|  in lectures at  |Caltech|Caltech|  during 1931. It was used, as super-Novae , in a journal paper published by  |Knut_Lundmark|Knut_Lundmark|  in 1933,  and in a 1934 paper by Baade and Zwicky.    By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.    Because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy, occurring about three times a century in the Milky Way,    obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies.     Supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy. Normally, when they are discovered, they are already in progress.    To use supernovae as  |standard_candles|Standard_Candle|  for measuring distance, observation of their peak luminosity is required. It is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum.  |Amateur_astronomers|Amateur_Astronomy| , who greatly outnumber professional astronomers, have played an important role in finding supernovae, typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an  |optical_telescope|Optical_Telescope|  and comparing them to earlier photographs.        Toward the end of the 20th century astronomers increasingly turned to computer-controlled telescopes and  |CCDs|Charge_Coupled_Device|  for hunting supernovae. While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the  |Katzman_Automatic_Imaging_Telescope|Katzman_Automatic_Imaging_Telescope| .    The  |Supernova_Early_Warning_System|Supernova_Early_Warning_System|  project uses a network of  |neutrino_detectors|Neutrino_Detector|  to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy.        |Neutrinos|Neutrino|  are  |particles|Subatomic_Particle|  that are produced in great quantities by a supernova, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.             Supernova searches fall into two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of the  |expansion_of_the_universe|Metric_Expansion_Of_Space| , the distance to a remote object with a known  |emission_spectrum|Emission_Spectrum|  can be estimated by measuring its  |Doppler_shift|Doppler_Shift|  ; on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z0.1–0.3    —where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrums frequency shift.     High redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves. These are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate  |Hubble_diagrams|Hubble_Diagram|  and make cosmological predictions. Supernova spectroscopy, used to study the physics and environments of supernovae, is more practical at low than at high redshift.       /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  |ef_re|Ef_Re|  ref name types  /ref ref name taxonomy /  ref namebianco  /ref  ref name taxonomy / ref name taxonomy  /ref  ref name zwicky2  /ref ref name zwicky  /ref  ref name doggett  /ref  |ef_re|Ef_Re|  ref name Piro2014  /ref ref name chen  /ref ref  /ref  ref name Mazzali2007  /ref  ref name Chandrasekhar  /ref ref namecanal1997  /ref  ref name Mazzali2007 /  ref namecanal1997/  ref name aaa270  /ref  ref name ropke  /ref  ref name explosionmodel  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name explosionmodel /  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref namewang  /ref ref namefoley  /ref  ref name mccully  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name heger  /ref ref name nomoto  /ref  ref name moriya  /ref  ref name smith  /ref  ref name gravwaves  /ref  ref name WoosleyJanka /  ref  /ref  ref  /ref sup /sup ref name WoosleyJanka / ref name barwick  /ref  ref  /ref  sup /sup ref name barwick /  ref name WoosleyJanka /  sup /sup ref name kasen  /ref  ref name WoosleyJanka  /ref ref name science304  /ref ref nameheger/ ref name hinshaw  /ref  ref name superagb /  sup /sup  |ef_ref_ref_re|Ef_Ref_Ref_Re|  ref  /ref  ref name eldridge  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref namefailed  /ref ref namegerke  /ref  ref nameadams/  ref  /ref  ref name S.M.
