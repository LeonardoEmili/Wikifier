Before becoming a manga artist, Asamiya graduated from the  |Tokyo_Designer_School|Tokyo_Designer_School| , then worked as a character designer for a number of anime series, and even designed models for some of the later  |Godzilla|Godzilla|  films . For this career, he used his real name, and maintained the two professional identities separately for many years. Several of the anime series that he worked on were very popular inside and outside Japan, most notably  Sonic Soldier Borgman  and  Project A-ko . Even after focusing primarily on his manga career, Asamiya continued to do character designs and creative consultation on anime series based on his stories, occasionally under the Kikuchi name.     In the early 2000s, Asamiya has shifted his focus from teenage and young-adult stories to stories designed for children and for an American audience. In the former case, he credits his children as a motivation but, in the latter case, he points to a long-standing desire to work with his favorite American characters. To that end, he has worked on projects with  |Image_Comics|Image_Comics| ,  |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics| , and  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics| , as well as developing a manga adaptation of the film  Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace .
