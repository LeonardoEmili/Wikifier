Digital Access Signalling System 2  is an obsolescent  |protocol|Protocol|  defined by  |British_Telecom|British_Telecom|  for digital links to  |PSTN|Pstn|  based on  |ISDN|Integrated_Services_Digital_Network| . Although still available on request, it has been superseded by  |ETS_300_102|Ets_300_102|  .     DASS2 is an improved version over  |DASS1|Dass1| , based on experiences with  |DPNSS|Dpnss| .     In the UK, the ISDN concept was first introduced to customers by BT with their   DASS2 connections. DASS2 is a BT-designed   signalling standard, and was introduced before the  |Q_931|Q_931|  standard was finalised   by the international community. British Telecom used the term ISDN when   describing their DASS2 lines.     DASS2 lines are provided to customers on a 2Mbit/s link and can handle 30 simultaneous calls . DASS2 is still offered by BT and other UK carriers. Q.931 is the name of the  |CCITT|Ccitt|  document that describes the agreed signalling format for International ISDN. CCITT had previously been known as International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee. The organisation set out the internationally agreed standards for telecommunications, and subsequently evolved into the ITU. In the United Kingdom, the Q.931-based protocol is ETS 300 102 . This is a very close implementation of the original CCITT specification. It is a 2Mbit/s service as   with DASS2, but the feature capability is far greater and has negated the problems associated with DASS2, including echo problems and circuit spikes. In the UK, both DASS 2 and EuroISDN lines are available to customers with EuroISDN as the preferred signalling type. Customers normally choose the desired signalling system, as this will be dictated by their CPE ,   usually a PABX.     Most modern PABXs can handle many different types of signalling system, however   the trend seems to be away from the DASS2 , and towards the internationally recognised Q.931 standard, which is utilised by many countrys telephony service providers.     The CCITT specify the standards for the layers 1, 2 and 3 signalling messages. The layer 3 messages are the messages which actually control the call setup, teardown, and routing.     The layer 3 messages or call control messages .
