Labour law  mediates the relationship between workers, employing entities,  |trade_unions|Trade_Union|  and the government. Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between  |employee|Employee| ,  |employer|Employer|  and union. Individual labour law concerns employees rights at work also through the  |contract|Contract|  for work.  are social norms  for the minimum socially acceptable conditions under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. Government agencies  enforce labour law .          Labour law arose in parallel with the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  as the relationship between worker and employer changed from small-scale production studios to large-scale factories. Workers sought better conditions and the right to join a  |labour_union|Labour_Union| , while employers sought a more predictable, flexible and less costly workforce. The state of labour law at any one time is therefore both the product of, and a component of struggles between various social forces.     As England was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to face the often appalling consequences of industrial revolution in a less regulated economic framework. Over the course of the late 18th and early to mid-19th century the foundation for modern labour law was slowly laid, as some of the more egregious aspects of working conditions were steadily ameliorated through legislation. This was largely achieved through the concerted pressure from  |social_reform|Social_Reform| ers, notably  |Anthony_Ashley_Cooper_7th_Earl_of_Shaftesbury|Anthony_Ashley_Cooper_7Th_Earl_Of_Shaftesbury| , and others.       A serious outbreak of fever in 1784 in  |cotton_mills|Cotton_Mills|  near  |Manchester|Manchester|  drew widespread public opinion against the use of children in dangerous conditions. A local inquiry, presided over by Dr  |Thomas_Percival|Thomas_Percival| , was instituted by the  |justices_of_the_peace|Justice_Of_The_Peace|  for  |Lancashire|Lancashire| , and the resulting report recommended the limitation of childrens working hours. From an Essay on Trade , quoted in History of Factory Legislation, by  |B_Leigh_Hutchins|B_Leigh_Hutchins|  and  |Amy_Harrison|Amy_Harrison|  , pp. 5, 6. In 1802, the first major piece of labour legislation was passed − the  |Health_and_Morals_of_Apprentices_Act|Health_And_Morals_Of_Apprentices_Act_1802| . This was the first, albeit modest, step towards the protection of labour. The act limited working hours to twelve a day and abolished night work. It required the provision of a basic level of education for all apprentices, as well as adequate sleeping accommodation and clothing.     The rapid industrialisation of manufacturing at the turn of the 19th century led to a rapid increase in child employment, and public opinion was steadily made aware of the terrible conditions these children were forced to endure. The  |Factory_Act_of_1819|Factory_Actscotton_Mills_Etc_Act_1819|  was the outcome of the efforts of the industrialist  |Robert_Owen|Robert_Owen|  and prohibited  |child_labour|Child_Labour|  under nine years of age and limited the working day to twelve. A great milestone in labour law was reached with the  |Factory_Act_of_1833|Factory_Actslabour_Of_Children_Etc_In_Factories_Act_1833| , which limited the employment of children under eighteen years of age, prohibited all night work and, crucially, provided for inspectors to enforce the law. Pivotal in the campaigning for and the securing of this legislation were  |Michael_Sadler|Michael_Thomas_Sadler|  and the  |Earl_of_Shaftesbury|Anthony_Ashley_Cooper_7Th_Earl_Of_Shaftesbury| . This act was an important step forward, in that it mandated skilled inspection of workplaces and a rigorous enforcement of the law by an independent governmental body.     A lengthy campaign to limit the working day to ten hours was led by Shaftesbury, and included support from the  |Anglican_Church|Anglican_Church| .   Many committees were formed in support of the cause and some previously established groups lent their support as well. Yale University Library holds full text versions of the Ten Hours Advocate in its microfilm department The campaign finally led to the passage of the  |Factory_Act_of_1847|Factory_Act_1847| , which restricted the working hours of women and children in British factories to effectively 10 hours per day. Bloy, Marjorie  The Factory Question accessed 20  March 2009          These early efforts were principally aimed at limiting child labour. From the mid-19th century, attention was first paid to the plight of  |working_conditions|Working_Conditions|  for the workforce in general. In 1850, systematic reporting of fatal accidents was made compulsory, and basic safeguards for health, life and limb in the mines were put in place from 1855. Further regulations, relating to ventilation, fencing of disused shafts, signalling standards, and proper gauges and valves for steam-boilers and related machinery were also set down.     A series of further Acts, in 1860 and 1872 extended the legal provisions and strengthened safety provisions. Steady development of the coal industry, increasing association among miners, and increased scientific knowledge paved the way for the Coal Mines Act of 1872, which extended the legislation to similar industries. The same Act included the first comprehensive code of regulation to govern legal safeguards for health, life and limb. The presence of a more certified and competent management and increased levels of inspection were also provided for.     By the end of the century, a comprehensive set of regulations was in place in England that affected all industries. A similar system was implemented in other industrializing countries in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century.              The basic feature of labour law in almost every country is that the rights and obligations of the worker and the employer are mediated through a  |contract_of_employment|Contract_Of_Employment|  between the two. This has been the case since the collapse of  |feudalism|Feudalism| . Many contract terms and conditions are covered by  |legislation|Legislation|  or  |common_law|Common_Law| . In the US for example, the majority of  |state_laws|State_Law|  allow for  |employment_to_be_at_will_|At_Will_Employment| , meaning the employer can terminate an employee from a position for any reason, so long as the reason is not explicitly prohibited, and, conversely, an employee may quit at any time, for any reason , and is not required to give notice.     One example of employment terms in many countries e.g. In the European Union, Directive 91/533 is the duty to provide written particulars of employment with the  essentialia negotii   to an employee. This aims to allow the employee to know concretely what to expect and what is expected. It covers items including  |compensation|Compensation_And_Benefits| ,  |holiday|Annual_Leave|  and  |illness_rights|Sick_Leave| , notice in the  |event_of_dismissal|Termination_Of_Employment|  and  |job_description|Job_Description| .     The contract is subject to various legal provisions. An employer may not legally offer a contract that pays the worker less than a minimum wage. An employee may not agree to a contract that allows an employer to  |dismiss_them_for_illegal_reasons|Wrongful_Dismissal| .          Many jurisdictions define the minimum amount that a worker can be paid per hour. Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan,South Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Spain,Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vietnam, Germany  and others have laws of this kind. The minimum wage is set usually higher than the lowest wage as determined by the forces of  |supply_and_demand|Supply_And_Demand|  in a  |free_market|Free_Market|  and therefore acts as a  |price_floor|Price_Floor| . Each country sets its own  |minimum_wage_laws|Minimum_Wage_Law|  and regulations, and while a majority of industrialized countries has a minimum wage, many developing countries do not.     Minimum wages are regulated and stipulated in some countries that lack explicit laws. In Sweden minimum wages are negotiated between the  |labour_market|Labour_Economics|  parties through  |collective_agreements|Collective_Agreements|  that also cover non-union workers at workplaces with collective agreements. At workplaces without collective agreements there exist no minimum wages. Non-organized employers can sign substitute agreements directly with trade unions but far from all do. The Swedish case illustrates that in countries without statutory regulation will part of the labour market do not have regulated minimum wages, as self-regulation only applies to workplaces and employees covered by collective agreements .

Lund: Juristförlaget i Lund 2017, pp. 357-383 Anders Kjellberg , Department of Sociology, Lund University. Studies in Social Policy, Industrial Relations, Working Life and Mobility. Research Reports 2017:1, Appendix 3 Tables F-G     National minimum wage laws were first introduced in the  |United_States_in_1938|Fair_Labor_Standards_Act| ,  Brazil in 1940  India in 1948,  France in 1950  and in the  |United_Kingdom_in_1998|National_Minimum_Wage_Act_1998| .  In the  |European_Union|European_Union| , 18 out of 28 member states have national minimum wages as of 2011.             The living wage is higher than the minimum wage and is designed that a full-time worker would be able to support themselves and a small family at that wage.           The maximum number of hours worked per day or other time interval are set by law in many countries. Such laws also control whether workers who work longer hours must be paid additional compensation.     Before the Industrial Revolution, the workday varied between 11 and 14 hours. With the growth of  |industrialism|Industrialism|  and the introduction of machinery, longer hours became far more common, reaching as high as 16 hours per day.     The  |eight_hour_movement|Eight_Hour_Day|  led to the first law on the length of a working day, passed in 1833 in England. It limited miners to 12 hours and children to 8 hours. The 10-hour day was established in 1848, and shorter hours with the same pay were gradually accepted thereafter. The 1802  |Factory_Act|Factory_Act|  was the first labour law in the UK.     Germany was the next European country to pass labour laws; Chancellor  |Otto_von_Bismarcks|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  main goal was to undermine the  |Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany| . In 1878, Bismarck instituted a variety of anti-socialist measures, but despite this, socialists continued gaining seats in the  |Reichstag|Reichstag| . To appease the working class, he enacted a variety of  |paternalistic|Paternalistic|  social reforms, which became the first type of  |social_security|Social_Security| . In 1883 the Health Insurance Act was passed, which entitled workers to health insurance; the worker paid two-thirds and the employer one-third of the premiums. Accident insurance was provided in 1884, while old age pensions and disability insurance followed in 1889. Other laws restricted the employment of women and children. These efforts, however, were not entirely successful; the working class largely remained unreconciled with Bismarcks conservative government.     In France, the first labour law was voted in 1841. It limited under-age miners hours. In the  |Third_Republic|French_Third_Republic|  labour law was first effectively enforced, in particular after  |Waldeck_Rousseau|Waldeck_Rousseau|  1884 law legalising  |trade_unions|Trade_Unions| . With the  |Matignon_Accords|Matignon_Accords| , the  |Popular_Front|Popular_Front|  enacted the laws mandating 12 days each year of  |paid_vacations|Annual_Leave|  for workers and the law limiting the standard workweek to 40 hours.            Other labour laws involve safety concerning workers. The earliest English  |factory_law|Factory_Actsfactory_Act_1802|  was passed in 1802 and dealt with the safety and health of  |child|Child_Labour| |_textile|Textile|  workers.          Such laws prohibited  |discrimination|Discrimination|  against employees as morally unacceptable and illegal, in particular  |racial_discrimination|Racial_Discrimination|  or  |gender_discrimination|Sexism| .           |Convention_no_158|Termination_Of_Employment_Convention_1982|  of the  |International_Labour_Organization|International_Labour_Organization|  states that an employee cant be fired without any legitimate motive and before offering him the possibility to defend himself . Thus, on April 28, 2006, after the unofficial repeal of the French  |First_Employment_Contract|First_Employment_Contract| , the  |Longjumeau|Longjumeau|   conseil des prudhommes judged the  |New_Employment_Contract|New_Employment_Contract|  contrary to  |international_law|International_Law|  and therefore illegitimate and without any juridical value . The court considered that the two-years period of fire at will was unreasonable , and contrary to convention.               Child labour was not seen as a problem throughout most of history, only disputed with the beginning of universal  |schooling|Education|  and the concepts of  |labourers|Labor_Rights|  and  |childrens_rights|Childrens_Rights| . Use of  |child_labour|Child_Labour|  was commonplace, often in factories. In England and Scotland in 1788, about two-thirds of persons working in water-powered  |textile|Textile|  factories were children.  Child labour can be factory work, mining or quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents business, operating a  |small_business|Small_Business|  , or doing odd jobs. Children work as guides for  |tourists|Tourism| , sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and  |restaurants|Restaurant|  . Other children do jobs such as assembling boxes or polishing shoes. However, rather than in factories and  |sweatshops|Sweatshop| , most child labour in the twenty-first century occurs in the informal sector, selling on the street, at work in  |agriculture|Agriculture|  or  |hidden_away_in_houses|Child_Domestic_Work|   — far from the reach of official inspectors and from media scrutiny.           Collective labour law concerns the relationship between employer, employee and  |trade_unions|Trade_Unions| . Trade unions are organizations which generally aim to promote the interests of their members.          Trade unions are organized groups of workers who engage in  |collective_bargaining|Collective_Bargaining|  with employers. Some countries require unions and/or employers to follow particular procedures in pursuit of their goals. For example, some countries require that unions poll the membership to approve a strike or to approve using members dues for political projects. Laws may govern the circumstances and procedures under which unions are formed. They may guarantee the right to join a union , or remain silent in this respect. Some legal codes allow unions to obligate their members, such as the requirement to comply with a majority decision in a strike vote. Some restrict this, such as  |right_to_work|Right_To_Work|  legislation in parts of the United States.     In the different organization in the different countries trade union discuses with the employee on behalf of employer. At that time trade union discussed or talk with the manpower of the organization. At that time trade union perform his role like a bridge between the employee and employer.          A legally binding right for workers as a group to participate in workplace management is acknowledged in some form in most developed countries. In a majority of EU member states the workforce has a right to elect directors on the board of large corporations. This is usually called codetermination and currently most countries allow for the election of one third of the board, though the workforce can have the right to elect anywhere from a single director, to just under a half in Germany.   However,  |German_company_law|German_Company_Law|  uses a split board system, in which a supervisory board appoints an executive board . Under the  |Mitbestimmunggesetz_1976|Mitbestimmunggesetz_1976| , shareholders and employees elect the supervisory board in equal numbers, but the head of the supervisory board with a casting vote is a shareholder representative. The first statutes to introduce board level codetermination were in Britain, however most of these measures, except in universities, were removed in 1948 and 1979. The oldest surviving statute is found in the United States, in the Massachusetts Laws on manufacturing corporations, introduced in 1919, however this was always voluntary.     In the United Kingdom, similar proposals were drawn up, and a command paper produced named the  |Bullock_Report_|Bullock_Report|  was released in 1977 by the  |James_Callaghan|James_Callaghan| |_Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  government. Unions would have directly elected half of the board. An independent element would also be added. However, the proposal was not enacted. The  |European_Commission|European_Commission|  offered proposals for worker participation in the fifth company law directive , which was also not implemented.     In Sweden, participation is regulated through the Law on board representation . The law covers all private companies with 25 or more employees. In these companies, workers have a right to appoint two board members and two substitutes. If the company has more than 1,000 employees, this rises to three members and three substitutes. It is common practice to allocate them among the major union coalitions.       Workplace statutes in many countries require that employers consult their workers on various issues.                       |Strike_action|Strike_Action|  is the worker tactic most associated with industrial disputes. In most countries, strikes are legal under a circumscribed set of conditions. Among them may be that:   The strike is decided on by a prescribed democratic process .    |Sympathy_strikes|Sympathy_Strike| , against a company by which workers are not directly employed, may be prohibited.    |General_strikes|General_Strike|  may be forbidden for example, among public safety workers, to maintain  |public_order|Public_Order| .     A  |boycott|Boycott|  is a refusal to buy, sell, or otherwise trade with an individual or business. Other tactics include  |go_slow|Go_Slow| ,  |sabotage|Sabotage| ,  |work_to_rule|Work_To_Rule| ,  |sit_in|Sit_In|  or en-masse not reporting to work.  Some labour law explicitly bans such activity, none explicitly allows it.      |Picketing|Picketing|  is often used by workers during strikes. They may congregate near the business they are striking against to make their presence felt, increase worker participation and dissuade  |strike_breakers|Strikebreaker|  from entering the workplace. In many countries, this activity is restricted by law, by more general law restricting demonstrations, or by injunctions on particular pickets. For example, labour law may restrict  |secondary_picketing|Picketing|  , or  |flying_pickets|Flying_Picket|  . Laws may prohibit obstructing others from conducting lawful business; outlaw obstructive pickets allow court orders to restrict picketing locations or behaving in particular ways .             The labour movement has long been concerned that economic  |globalization|Globalization|  would weaken worker bargaining power, as their employers could hire workers abroad to avoid domestic labour standards.  |Karl_Marx|Karl_Marx|  said:      The International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization have been a primary focus among international bodies for regulating labour markets. Conflicts arise when people work in more than one country. EU law has a growing body of workplace rules.          Following  |World_War_One|World_War_One| , the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles|  contained the first constitution of a new  |International_Labour_Organization|International_Labour_Organization|  founded on the principle that labour is not a commodity , and for the reason that peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice .  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles| |_Part_XIII|S_Constitution_Of_The_International_Labour_Office| , Section I, and Article 427 ILOs primary role has been to coordinate international labour law by issuing Conventions. ILO members can voluntarily adopt and ratify the Conventions. For instance, the first  |Hours_of_Work_Convention_1919|Hours_Of_Work_Convention_1919|  required a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members, although the  |Working_Time_Directive|Working_Time_Directive|  adopts its principles, subject to individual opt-out. ILOs constitution comes from the 1944  |Declaration_of_Philadelphia|Declaration_Of_Philadelphia|  and under the 1998  |Declaration_on_Fundamental_Principles_and_Rights_at_Work|Declaration_On_Fundamental_Principles_And_Rights_At_Work|  classified eight conventions as core.     These require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action , abolition of forced labour , abolition of labour by children before the end of compulsory school , and no discrimination at work . Member compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states progress, relying on publicity to create pressure to reform. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or less frequent basis.        Because the ILOs enforcement mechanisms are weak, incorporating  |labour_standards_in_the_World_Trade_Organizations|Labour_Standards_In_The_World_Trade_Organization|  operation has been proposed. WTO oversees, primarily, the  |General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade|General_Agreement_On_Tariffs_And_Trade|  treaty aimed at reducing  |customs|Customs| ,  |tariffs|Tariff|  and other barriers to import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, contravening WTO rules as recognized by the  |dispute_settlement_procedures|Dispute_Settlement_In_The_World_Trade_Organization|  opens a country to retaliation through  |trade_sanctions|Trade_Sanctions| . This could include reinstatement of targeted tariffs against the offender.     Proponents have called for a  |social_clause|Social_Clause|  to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example, by amending Article XX, which provides an exception that allows imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow comparable action where a WTO member state breaches ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could undermine labour rights, because industries, and therefore workforces could be harmed with no guarantee of reform. Furthermore, it was argued in the 1996 Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that the  |comparative_advantage|Comparative_Advantage|  of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question.  Some countries want to take advantage of low wages and fewer rules as a comparative advantage to boost their economies. Another contested point is whether business moves production from high wage to low wage countries, given potential differences in worker productivity.  Since GATT, most trade agreements have been bilateral. Some of these protect core labour standards.  Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations, some countries give preference to countries that respect core labour rights, for example under the EC Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.            |Conflicts_of_laws|Conflicts_Of_Laws|   issues arise where workers work in multiple jurisdictions. If a US worker performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark an employer may seek to characterize the employment contract as governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a  |UK_labour_law|Uk_Labour_Law|  case,  Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd   Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of  |Halliburton|Halliburton| . He was dismissed by a supervisor based in  |Egypt|Egypt| . He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK  |Employment_Rights_Act_1996|Employment_Rights_Act_1996|  he would have a right to claim unfair dismissal, but the Act left open the question of the statutes territorial scope. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that an expatriate worker, would be subject to UK rules if the worker could show a close connection to the UK, which was found in Rabats case.     This fits within the general framework in the EU. Under EU  |Rome_I_Regulation|Rome_I_Regulation|  article 8,  |Rome_I_Regulation|Rome_I_Regulation|   workers have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. They may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker. , recital 23 and , recital 13     It is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the  |Brussels_I_Regulation|Brussels_I_Regulation|  article 19,  this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought, or is engaged there.             The European Union has extensive labour laws that officially exclude  matters around direct wage regulation , fairness of dismissals and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the  |Working_Time_Directive|Working_Time_Directive|  guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the  |Equality_Framework_Directive|Equality_Framework_Directive|  prohibits all forms of discrimination and the  |Collective_Redundancies_Directive|Collective_Redundancies_Directive|  requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place on decisions about economic dismissals.     However, the  |European_Court_of_Justice|European_Court_Of_Justice|  has recently extended the Treaties provisions via  |case_law|Case_Law| . Trade unions have sought to organize across borders in the same way that  |multinational_corporations|Multinational_Corporations|  have organized production globally. Unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. However, this coordination was challenged in the  |European_Union|European_Union|  in two controversial decisions. In  Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union   Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union  C-319/05  a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden. The local union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective bargaining agreement. Under the  |Posted_Workers_Directive|Posted_Workers_Directive| , article 3 lays down minimum standards for foreign workers so that workers receive at least the minimum rights that they would have in their home country in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3 says that this shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers . Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum by the host states legislation or a collective agreement. However the  |European_Court_of_Justice|European_Court_Of_Justice|  said that only the local state could raise standards beyond its minimum for foreign workers. Any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement would infringe the business freedom under  |TFEU|Tfeu|  article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the  |Rome_I_Regulation|Rome_I_Regulation| , which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in  The Rosella , the ECJ held that a blockade by the  |International_Transport_Workers_Federation|International_Transport_Workers_Federation|  against a business that was using an  |Estonia|Estonia| n  |flag_of_convenience|Flag_Of_Convenience|  infringed the business right of free establishment under  |TFEU|Tfeu|  article 49. The ECJ said that it recognized the workers right to strike in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business establishment.           The  |Fair_Work_Act_of_2009|Fair_Work_Act_2009|  provides the regulations governing Australian workplaces and employers. Australia has a minimum wage and workplace conditions overseen by the  |Fair_Work_Commission|Fair_Work_Commission| .                 In Canadian law, labour law refers to matters connected with unionized workplaces, while employment law deals with non-unionized employees.     In 2017, Premier  |Brad_Wall|Brad_Wall|  announced that Saskatchewans government is to cut 3.5 percent from its workers and officers wages in 2018. This salary cut includes  |MLA|Legislative_Assembly_Of_Saskatchewan|  ministers and the Premiers office staff along all people employed by the government. Unpaid days off, will also be implemented as well as limiting overtime to assist the wage cut.              In the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  the basic labour laws are the  Labour Law of Peoples Republic of China  and the  Labour Contract Law of the Peoples Republic of China  . The administrative regulations enacted by the State Council, the ministerial rules and the judicial explanations of the  |Supreme_Peoples_Court|Supreme_Peoples_Court|  stipulate detailed rules concerning various aspects of employment. The government-controlled  |All_China_Federation_of_Trade_Unions|All_China_Federation_Of_Trade_Unions|  is the sole legal labour union. Strikes are formally legal, but in practice are discouraged.            In France, the first labour laws were  |Waldeck_Rousseaus|Waldeck_Rousseau|  laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the  |Popular_Front|Popular_Front|  enacted a law mandating 12 days each year of paid  |vacation|Annual_Leave|  for workers, and a  |law|Matignon_Accords|  limited the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The  |Grenelle_accords|_Fr_Accords_De_Grenelle|  negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise.   Section syndicale dentreprise  December 27, 1968 law The minimum wage was increased by 25%.   |SMIG|_Fr_Salaire_Minimum_Interprofessionnel_Garanti|  In 2000,  |Lionel_Jospins|Lionel_Jospin|  government enacted the  |35_hour_workweek|35_Hour_Workweek| , reduced from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister  |Dominique_de_Villepin|Dominique_De_Villepin|  enacted the  |New_Employment_Contract|New_Employment_Contract|  . Addressing the demands of employers asking for more  |flexibility|Labour_Market_Flexibility|  in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it favoured  |contingent_work|Contingent_Work| . In 2006, he then attempted to pass the  |First_Employment_Contract|First_Employment_Contract|  through a vote by emergency procedure, but that was met by  |students_and_unions_protests|2006_Labour_Protests_In_France| . President  |Jacques_Chirac|Jacques_Chirac|  finally had no choice but to repeal it.              Over fifty national and many more state-level laws govern work in India. So for instance, a permanent worker can be terminated only for proven misconduct or habitual absence.  In the  |Uttam_Nakate|Uttam_Nakate|  case, the  |Bombay_High_Court|Bombay_High_Court|  held that dismissing an employee for repeated sleeping on the factory floor was illegal – the decision was overturned by the  |Supreme_Court_of_India|Supreme_Court_Of_India|  two decades later.

The labour law of  |Switzerland|Switzerland|  covers all standards governing the  |employment|Employment|  of some kind. The regulation of the employment by private employers is largely harmonized at the  |federal|Federal_Government|  level, while public-sector employment still prevails a variety of  |cantonal|Cantonal|  laws. In particular, the civil standardization is distributed to a variety of laws. Of greater importance, particularly the new  |Federal_Constitution|Swiss_Federal_Constitution|  of 1999, the  |Code_of_Obligations|Code_Of_Obligations|  , the  |Labour_Code|Labour_Code|  as well as in the public sector, the  |Federal_Personnel_Act|Federal_Personnel_Act| .

Most employment law before 1960 was based upon the Law of Contract. Since then there has been a significant expansion primarily due to the equality movement  and the European Union. Laws are either Acts of Parliament called Statutes, Statutory Regulations or Case Law .     The first significant expansion was the Equal Pay Act of 1970. This act was introduced to bring about pay equality for women in the workplace. Since 1997, changes in UK employment law include enhanced maternity and paternity rights,  the introduction of a National Minimum Wage  and the Working Time Regulations,  which covers working time, rest breaks and the right to paid annual leave.

Professionals, clerical , technical, and mechanical employees cannot be terminated for refusing to work more than 72 hours in a work week.

The private sector is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but several laws, particularly the  |Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964|Civil_Rights_Act_Of_1964| , limit the private sector discrimination against certain groups. The  |Fifth_Amendment|Fifth_Amendment_To_The_United_States_Constitution|   has an explicit requirement that the Federal Government not deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property , without due process of law and an implicit guarantee that each person receive equal protection of the law.

Retaliation is also prohibited by Title VII against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute.

The beginnings of halakhic labour law are in the Bible, in which two commandments refer to this subject: The law against delayed wages and the workers right to eat the employers crops . The Talmudic law—in which labour law is called laws of worker hiring —elaborates on many more aspects of employment relations, mainly in Tractate Baba Metzia. In some issues the Talamud, following the Tosefta, refers the parties to the customary law: All is as the custom of the region .   Modern halakhic labour law developed very slowly. Rabbi Israel Meir Hacohen interprets the workers right for timely payment in a tendency that clearly favours the employee over the employer, but does not refer to new questions of employment relations. Only in the 1920s we find the first halakhic authority to tackle the questions of trade unions and the right of strike . Rabbis  |A_I_Kook|Abraham_Isaac_Kook|  and  |B_M_H_Uziel|Ben_Zion_Meir_Hai_Uziel|  tend to  |corporatist|Corporatism|  settling of labour  |conflicts|Conflict| , while Rabbi  |Moshe_Feinstein|Moshe_Feinstein|  clearly adopts the liberal democratic  |collective_bargaining|Collective_Bargaining| .
