           Crux  is a  |constellation|Constellation|  centred on four stars in the  |southern_sky|Southern_Sky|  in a bright portion of the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| . It is among the most easily distinguished constellations as its hallmark stars each have an  |apparent_visual_magnitude|Apparent_Visual_Magnitude|  brighter than +2.8, even though it is the  |smallest|List_Of_Constellations_By_Area|  of all  |88_modern_constellations|88_Modern_Constellations| . Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for  |cross|Cross| , and it is dominated by a cross-shaped or kite-like  |asterism|Asterism|  that is commonly known as the Southern Cross.     Predominating the constellation is the first-magnitude blue-white star of  |α_Crucis|Α_Crucis|  , its brightest and most southerly member. There follow four less dominant stars which appear clockwise and in order of lessening magnitude:  |β_Crucis|Β_Crucis|  ,  |γ_Crucis|Γ_Crucis|  ,  |δ_Crucis|Δ_Crucis|  and  |ε_Crucis|Ε_Crucis|  . Many of these brighter stars are members of the  |Scorpius–Centaurus_Association|Scorpius–Centaurus_Association| , a large but loose group of hot blue-white stars that appear to share common origins and motion across the southern  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| .     Crux contains four  |Cepheid_variables|Classical_Cepheid_Variable| , each visible to the naked eye under optimum conditions. Crux also contains the bright and colourful  |open_cluster|Open_Cluster|  known as the  |Jewel_Box|Jewel_Box|  on its western border. To the southeast figures a large, relatively near  |dark_nebula|Dark_Nebula|  spanning 7° by 5° known as the  |Coalsack_Nebula|Coalsack_Nebula| , portions of which are mapped in the neighbouring constellations of  |Centaurus|Centaurus|  and  |Musca|Musca| .       The bright stars in Crux were known to the  |Ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greeks| , where  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  regarded them as part of the constellation Centaurus.   They were entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC. However, the  |precession_of_the_equinoxes|Precession_Of_The_Equinoxes|  gradually lowered the stars below the European horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes. By 400   |CE|Common_Era| , the stars in the constellation we now call Crux never rose above the horizon throughout most of Europe.  |Dante|Dante_Alighieri|  may have known about the constellation in the 14th century, as he describes an asterism of four bright stars in the southern sky in his  |Divine_Comedy|Divine_Comedy| .  Others argue that Dantes description was allegorical, and that he almost certainly did not know about the constellation.           The 15th  century Venetian navigator  |Alvise_Cadamosto|Alvise_Cadamosto|  made note of what was probably the Southern Cross on exiting the  |Gambia_River|Gambia_River|  in 1455, calling it the carro dellostro . However, Cadamostos accompanying diagram was inaccurate. . However, no manuscript of Cadamostos notebook has survived, only the printed version, and the errors in the diagram may be due to the printers decision.  Historians generally credit  |João_Faras|João_Faras| |João_Faras|João_Faras|  was an astronomer and physician of King  |Manuel_I_of_Portugal|Manuel_I_Of_Portugal|  who accompanied  |Pedro_Álvares_Cabral|Pedro_Álvares_Cabral|  in the discovery of Brazil in 1500 for being the first European to depict it correctly. Faras sketched and described the constellation in a letter written on the beaches of Brazil on 1  May 1500 to the Portuguese monarch.       Explorer  |Amerigo_Vespucci|Amerigo_Vespucci|  seems to have observed not only the Southern Cross but also the neighboring Coalsack Nebula on his second voyage in 1501–1502.      Another early modern description clearly describing Crux as a separate constellation is attributed to  |Andreas_Corsali|Andrea_Corsali| , an Italian navigator who from 1515–1517 sailed to China and the East Indies in an expedition sponsored by King Manuel  I. In 1516, Corsali wrote a letter to the monarch describing his observations of the southern sky, which included a rather crude map of the stars around the south celestial pole including the Southern Cross and the two Magellanic Clouds seen in an external orientation, as on a globe.        |Emery_Molyneux|Emery_Molyneux|  and  |Petrus_Plancius|Petrus_Plancius|  have also been cited as the first  |uranographers|Celestial_Cartography|  to distinguish Crux as a separate constellation; their representations date from 1592, the former depicting it on his celestial globe and the latter in one of the small celestial maps on his large wall map. Both authors, however, depended on unreliable sources and placed Crux in the wrong position. Crux was first shown in its correct position on the celestial globes of  |Petrus_Plancius|Petrus_Plancius|  and  |Jodocus_Hondius|Jodocus_Hondius|  in 1598 and 1600. Its stars were first catalogued separately from Centaurus by  |Frederick_de_Houtman|Frederick_De_Houtman|  in 1603.  The constellation was later adopted by  |Jakob_Bartsch|Jakob_Bartsch|  in 1624 and  |Augustin_Royer|Augustin_Royer|  in 1679. Royer is sometimes wrongly cited as initially distinguishing Crux.          Crux is bordered by the constellations  |Centaurus|Centaurus|  on the east, north and west, and  |Musca|Musca|  to the south. Covering 68  square degrees and 0.165% of the night sky, it is the smallest of the 88 constellations.  The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is Cru.  The official constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments. In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between −55.68° and −64.70°.  Its totality figures at least part of the year south of the  |25th_parallel_north|25Th_Parallel_North| .       In tropical regions Crux can be seen in the sky from April to June. Crux is exactly opposite to  |Cassiopeia|Cassiopeia|  on the celestial sphere, and therefore it cannot appear in the sky with the latter at the same time. In this era, south of Cape Town, Adelaide and Buenos Aires , Crux is circumpolar and thus always appears in the sky.     Crux is sometimes confused with the nearby  |False_Cross|False_Cross|  by stargazers. The False Cross is larger and dimmer, does not have a fifth star, and lacks the two prominent nearby Pointer Stars . Between the two is the even larger and dimmer  |Diamond_Cross|Diamond_Cross| .          Crux is easily visible from the  |southern_hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere|  at practically any time of year. It is also visible near the horizon from  |tropical_latitudes|Tropics|  of the  |northern_hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere|  for a few hours every night during the northern winter and spring. For instance, it is visible from  |Cancun|Cancun|  or any other place at latitude 25° N or less at around 10 pm at the end of April.   There are 5 main stars.   Due to  |precession|Precession| , Crux will move closer to the South Pole in the next millennia, up to 67 degrees south declination for the middle of the constellation. But in AD 18000 or BC 8000 Crux will be and was less than 30 degrees south declination making it visible in Northern Europe. Even by AD 14000, it will be visible for most parts of Europe and the whole United States.          In the  |Southern_Hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere| , the Southern Cross is frequently used for  |navigation|Celestial_Navigation|  in much the same way that  |Polaris|Polaris|  is used in the  |Northern_Hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| . Projecting a line from  |γ|Γ_Crucis|  to  |α_Crucis|Α_Crucis|  approximately  times beyond gives a point close to the Southern Celestial Pole which is also, coincidentally, where intersects a perpendicular line taken southwards from the east-west axis of  |Alpha_Centauri|Alpha_Centauri|  to  |Beta_Centauri|Beta_Centauri| , which are stars at an alike declination to Crux and of a similar width as the cross, but higher magnitude.     |Argentine|Argentina| |gauchos|Gaucho|  are documented as using Crux for night orientation in the  |Pampas|Pampa|  and  |Patagonia|Patagonia| .     Alpha and Beta Centauri are of similar declinations are often referred as the Southern Pointers or just The Pointers , allowing people to easily identify the Southern Cross, the constellation of Crux. Very few bright stars of importance lie between Crux and the pole itself, although the constellation  |Musca|Musca|  is fairly easily recognised immediately beneath Crux.                 Within the constellations borders, there are 49 stars brighter than or equal to  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  6.5. The four main stars that form the asterism are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Crucis.    |α_Crucis|Α_Crucis|  or Acrux is a triple star 321 light-years from Earth. A rich blue in colour, with a visual  |magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  0.8 to the unaided eye, it has two close components of a similar magnitude, 1.3 and 1.8 respectively, plus another much wider component of the 5th magnitude. The two close components are resolved in a small amateur telescope and the wide component is readily visible in a pair of binoculars.    |β_Crucis|Β_Crucis|  or Mimosa is a blue-hued giant star of magnitude 1.3, and lies 353 light-years from Earth. It is a  |Beta_Cephei|Beta_Cephei| -type  |variable_star|Variable_Star|  with a variation of less than 0.1 magnitudes.  |γ_Crucis|Γ_Crucis|  or Gacrux is an optical  |double_star|Double_Star| . The primary is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 1.6, 88 light-years from Earth, and is one of the closest  |red_giants|Red_Giant|  to Earth. Its secondary component is magnitude 6.5, 264 light-years from Earth.    |δ_Crucis|Δ_Crucis|  is a magnitude 2.8 blue-white hued star about 345 light-years from Earth. Like Mimosa it is a Beta Cepheid variable.     There is also a fifth star, that is often included with the Southern Cross.      |ε_Crucis|Ε_Crucis|  is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6, 228 light-years from Earth.     There are several other naked-eye stars within the borders of Crux, especially:      |Iota_Crucis|Iota_Crucis|  is a visual  |double_star|Double_Star|  125 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary at magnitude 9.5.    |Mu_Crucis|Mu_Crucis|  or Mu 1,2 Crucis is a wide double star where the components are about 370 light-years from Earth. Equally blue-white in colour, the components are magnitude 4.0 and 5.1 respectively, and are easily divisible in small amateur telescopes or large binoculars.         Unusually, a total of 15 of the 23 brightest stars in Crux are spectrally blue-white B-type stars. Among the five main bright stars, Epsilon, and probably Alpha and Beta, are likely co-moving B-type members of the  |Scorpius–Centaurus_Association|Scorpius–Centaurus_Association| , the nearest  |OB_association|Stellar_Association|  to the  |Sun|Sun| .   They are among the highest-mass stellar members of the Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the association, with ages of roughly 10 to 20  million years.   Other members include the blue-white stars  |Zeta|Zeta_Crucis| ,  |Lambda|Lambda_Crucis|  and both the components of the visual  |double_star|Double_Star| ,  |Mu|Mu_Crucis| .          Crux contains many  |variable_stars|Variable_Star| . It boasts four  |Cepheid_variables|Cepheid_Variable|  that may all reach naked eye visibility.      |BG_Crucis|Bg_Crucis|  ranges from magnitude 5.34 to 5.58 over 3.3428 days,     |T_Crucis|T_Crucis|  ranges from 6.32 to 6.83 over 6.73331 days,     |S_Crucis|S_Crucis|  ranges from 6.22 to 6.92 over 4.68997 days,     |R_Crucis|R_Crucis|  ranges from 6.4 to 7.23 over 5.82575 days.      Other well studied variable stars includes:      |Lambda_Crucis|Lambda_Crucis|  and  |Theta_2_Crucis|Theta2_Crucis| , that are both Beta Cepheid type variable stars.    |BH_Crucis|Bh_Crucis| , also known as Welchs Red Variable, is a  |Mira_variable|Mira_Variable|  that ranges from magnitude 6.6 to 9.8 over 530 days.  Discovered in October 1969, it has become redder and brighter and its period lengthened by 25% in the first thirty years since its discovery.          The star  |HD_106906|Hd_106906|  has been found to have a planet— |HD_106906_b|Hd_106906_B| —that has a larger orbit than any other  |exoplanet|Exoplanet|  discovered to date.         Crux is placed in a bright part of the Milky Way, and features many deep-sky objects within its boundaries. The most well known of them include:     The  |Coalsack_Nebula|Coalsack_Nebula|  is the most prominent  |dark_nebula|Dark_Nebula|  in the skies, and is easily visible to the naked eye as a prominent dark patch in the southern Milky Way. It can be found 6.5° southeast from the centre of Crux or 3° east from α Crucis. It large area covers about 7° by 5°, and is  away from  |Earth|Earth| .  Not all of the nebula is in the borders of Crux; some of it is technically in the constellations of  |Musca|Musca| ,  |Centaurus|Centaurus| .  |Jewel_Box|Jewel_Box| , Kappa Crucis Cluster or NGC 4755, is a small but bright  |open_cluster|Open_Cluster|  that appears as a fuzzy star to the naked eye and is placed very close to the westernmost boundary of Crux: about 1° southwest of Beta Crucis The combined or total magnitude is 4.2 and it lies at a distance of  from Earth. The cluster was given its name by  |John_Herschel|John_Herschel| , based on the range of colours visible throughout the star cluster in his telescope. About seven million years old,  it is one of the youngest open clusters in the Milky Way, and it appears to have the shape of a letter A. The Jewel Box Cluster is classified as Shapley class g and Trumpler class I 3 r - cluster; it is a very rich, centrally-concentrated cluster detached from the surrounding star field. It has more than 100 stars that range significantly in brightness. The brightest cluster stars are mostly  |blue_supergiants|Blue_Supergiant| , though the cluster contains at least one  |red_supergiant|Red_Supergiant| .  |Kappa_Crucis|Kappa_Crucis|  is a true member of the cluster that bears its name, and is one of the brighter stars at magnitude 5.9.       The most prominent feature of Crux is the distinctive asterism known as the Southern Cross. It has great significance in the cultures of the southern hemisphere, particularly of Australia and New Zealand.                 Several southern countries and organisations have traditionally used Crux as a national or distinctive symbol. The four or five brightest stars of Crux appear, heraldically standardised in various ways, on the flags of  |Australia|Flag_Of_Australia| ,  |Brazil|Flag_Of_Brazil| ,  |New_Zealand|Flag_Of_New_Zealand| ,  |Papua_New_Guinea|Papua_New_Guinea|  and  |Samoa|Samoa| . They also appear on the flags of the  |Australian_state_of_Victoria|Flag_Of_Victoria| , the  |Australian_Capital_Territory|Flag_Of_Australian_Capital_Territory| , the  |Northern_Territory|Flag_Of_Northern_Territory| , as well as the flag of  |Magallanes_Region_of_Chile|Flag_Of_Magallanes| , the flag of  |Londrina|Londrina|  and several  |Argentine|Argentina|  provincial flags and emblems . The flag of the  |Mercosur|Mercosur|  trading zone displays the four brightest stars. Crux also appears on the  |Brazilian_coat_of_arms|Coat_Of_Arms_Of_Brazil|  and, , on the cover of  |Brazilian_passports|Brazilian_Passport| .     A Cross also gets a mention in the lyrics of the  |Brazilian_National_Anthem|Brazilian_National_Anthem|  : A imagem do Cruzeiro resplandece . Five stars appear in the logo of the Brazilian football team  |Cruzeiro_Esporte_Clube|Cruzeiro_Esporte_Clube|  and in the  |Brazilian_coat_of_arms|Brazilian_Coat_Of_Arms| , and the cross has featured as name of the Brazilian currency . All coins of the  series of the  |Brazilian_real|Brazilian_Real|  display the constellation.     Songs and literature reference the Southern Cross, including the Argentine epic poem  Martín Fierro . The Argentinian singer  |Charly_García|Charly_García|  says that he is from the Southern Cross in the song No voy en tren .      |Southern_Cross|Southern_Cross|  is a single released by  |Crosby,_Stills_and_Nash|Crosby,_Stills_And_Nash|  in 1981. It reached 18 on Billboard Hot 100 in late 1982.     The  |Order_of_the_Southern_Cross|Order_Of_The_Southern_Cross|  is a Brazilian  |order_of_chivalry|Order_Of_Chivalry|  awarded to those who have rendered significant service to the Brazilian nation .     In  |O_Sweet_Saint_Martins_Land|O_Sweet_Saint_Martins_Land|  , the lyrics mention the Southern Cross: Thy Southern Cross the night.     A stylized version of Crux appears on the Australian  |Eureka_Flag|Eureka_Flag| . The constellation was also used on the dark blue, shield-like patch worn by personnel of the U.S. Armys  |Americal_Division|Americal_Division| , which was organized in the Southern Hemisphere, on the island of  |New_Caledonia|New_Caledonia| , and also on the blue diamond of the  |U.S._1st_Marine_Division|1St_Marine_Division| , which fought on the Southern Hemisphere islands of  |Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal|  and  |New_Britain|New_Britain| .     The Petersflagge flag of the  |German_East_Africa_Company|German_East_Africa_Company|  of 1885–1920, which included a constellation of five white five-pointed Crux stars on a red ground, later served as the model for symbolism associated with generic German colonial-oriented organisations: the  |Reichskolonialbund|Reichskolonialbund|  of 1936–1943 and the  .      |Southern_Cross_station|Southern_Cross_Railway_Station|  is a major rail terminal in Melbourne, Australia.

Two Pacific constellations also included  |Gamma_Centauri|Gamma_Centauri| .  |Torres_Strait_Islanders|Torres_Strait_Islanders|  in modern-day Australia saw Gamma Centauri as the handle and the four stars as the  |trident|Trident|  of Tagais Fishing Spear. The  |Aranda_people|Aranda_People|  of central Australia saw the four Cross stars as the talon of an  |eagle|Eagle|  and Gamma Centauri as its leg.     Various peoples in the  |East_Indies|East_Indies|  and Brazil viewed the four main stars as the body of a  |ray.|Ray|  In both Indonesia and Malaysia, it is known as Bintang Pari and Buruj Pari respectively     The  |Javanese_people|Javanese_People|  of Indonesia called this constellation Gubug pèncèng or lumbung , because the shape of the constellation was like that of a  |raking_hut|Raking_Hut| .      The Southern Cross  together with  |μ_Crucis|Mu_Crucis|  is one of the asterisms used by  |Bugis|Bugis|  sailors for navigation, called bintoéng bola képpang, meaning incomplete house star      The  |Māori|Māori_Language|  name for the Southern Cross is Te Punga . It is thought of as the anchor of Tama-reretis  waka  , while the Pointers are its rope.  In  |Tonga|Tonga|  it is known as Toloa ; it is depicted as a duck flying south, with one of his wings  wounded because Ongo tangata  threw a stone at it. The Coalsack is known as Humu , because of its shape. In Samoa the constellation is called Sumu because of its rhomboid shape, while α and β Centauri are called Luatagata , just as they are in Tonga. The peoples of the  |Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands|  saw several figures in the Southern Cross. These included a knee protector and a net used to catch  |Palolo_worms|Palolo_Worm| . Neighboring peoples in the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|  saw these stars as a fish.     In  |Mapudungun|Mapudungun| , the language of Patagonian  |Mapuches|Mapuche| , the name of the Southern Cross is Melipal, which means four stars . In  |Quechua|Quechua_Languages| , the language of the  |Inca|Inca|  civilization, Crux is known as  |Chakana|Chakana|  , which means literally stair , but carries a deep symbolism within Quechua mysticism.  Alpha and Beta Crucis make up one foot of the Great Rhea, a constellation encompassing  |Centaurus|Centaurus|  and  |Circinus|Circinus|  along with the two bright stars. The Great Rhea was a constellation of the  |Bororo|Bororo|  of Brazil. The  |Mocoví_people|Mocoví_People|  of Argentina also saw a  |rhea|Rhea|  including the stars of Crux.
