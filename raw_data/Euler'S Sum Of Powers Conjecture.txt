Eulers conjecture is a disproved  |conjecture|Conjecture|  in  |mathematics|Mathematics|  related to  |Fermats_last_theorem|Fermats_Last_Theorem| . It was proposed by  |Leonhard_Euler|Leonhard_Euler|  in 1769. It states that for all  |integers|Integers|   and  greater than 1, if the sum of  th powers of positive integers is itself a th power, then  is greater than or equal to  ⇒      The conjecture represents an attempt to generalize  |Fermats_last_theorem|Fermats_Last_Theorem| , which is the special case , then .     Although the conjecture holds for the case  , it was disproved for  and . It is unknown whether the conjecture fails or holds for any value .       Euler was aware of the equality  involving sums of four fourth powers; this however is not a  |counterexample|Counterexample|  because no term is isolated on one side of the equation. He also provided a complete solution to the four cubes problem as in  |Platos_number|Platos_Number|   or the  |taxicab_number|Taxicab_Number|  1729.   The general solution of the equation   : x13+x23x33+x43   is   : x1 1-,   x2 -1   : x3 -2,   x4 2-   where  and  are any integers.       Eulers conjecture was disproven by  |L._J._Lander|Leon_J._Lander|  and  |T._R._Parkin|Thomas_Parkin|  in 1966 when, through a direct computer search on a  |CDC_6600|Cdc_6600| , they found a counterexample for ,  This was published in a paper comprising just two sentences.  A total of three primitive counterexamples are known:   :: ,   :: , and   :: .     In 1986,  |Noam_Elkies|Noam_Elkies|  found a method to construct an infinite series of counterexamples for the  case.  His smallest counterexample was   ::.     A particular case of Elkies solutions can be reduced to the identity     ::   where   ::.   This is an  |elliptic_curve|Elliptic_Curve|  with a  |rational_point|Rational_Point|  at . From this initial rational point, one can compute an infinite collection of others. Substituting  into the identity and removing common factors gives the numerical example cited above.     In 1988,  |Roger_Frye|Roger_Frye|  found the smallest possible counterexample   ::   for  by a direct computer search using techniques suggested by Elkies. This solution is the only one with values of the variables below 1,000,000.              In 1967, L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and  |John_Selfridge|John_Selfridge|  conjectured  that if   :   aik   bjk ,   where  are positive integers for all  and , then . In the special case , the conjecture states that if   :   aik bk   then .     The special case may be described as the problem of giving a  |partition|Partition|  of a perfect power into few like powers. For  and  or , there are many known solutions. Some of these are listed below. As of 2002, there are no solutions for k6 whose final term is ≤ 730000.
