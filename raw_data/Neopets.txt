Neopets was conceived in 1997 by  |Adam_Powell|Adam_Powell| , a  |British|British_People|  student at the  |University_of_Nottingham|University_Of_Nottingham|  at the time. He shared this idea with Donna Williams and the two started work on the site in September 1999, with Powell responsible for the programming and the database and Williams the web design and art. The site launched on November 15, 1999 from offices in Portsmouth Road,  |Guildford|Guildford| , a location still commemorated on the site. Powell stated that the original goal was to keep university students entertained, and possibly make some cash from banner advertising . The site contained  |popular_culture|Popular_Culture|  references, such as a Neopet that was simply a picture of  |Bruce_Forsyth|Bruce_Forsyth| .     The user base grew by  |word_of_mouth|Word_Of_Mouth|  and by  |Christmas|Christmas|  1999, Neopets was logging 600,000  |page_views|Page_View|  daily and sought investors to cover the high cost of running the site. Later in the month,  |American|Americans|  businessman  |Doug_Dohring|Doug_Dohring|  was introduced to the creators of the site and, along with other investors, bought a majority share in January of the following year. Dohring founded Neopets, Inc. in February 2000 and began business on April 28.  |Intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property|  that did not belong to Neopets was removed but the site kept the  |British_spellings|American_And_British_English_Spelling_Differences| . The website made money from the first paying customers using an advertising method trademarked as  |immersive_advertising|Immersive_Advertising|  and touted as an evolutionary step forward in the traditional marketing practice of  |product_placement|Product_Placement|  in television and film. In 2004, Neopets released a premium version and started showing advertisements on the basic site that were not shown to premium members.        |Media_conglomerate|Media_Conglomerate| |Viacom|Viacom|  purchased Neopets, Inc. on June 20, 2005 for $160 million and announced plans to focus more on the use of  |banner_ads|Banner_Ad|  over the sites existing immersive advertising. The website was redesigned on April 27, 2007 and included changes to the user interface and the ability to customise Neopets. In June, Viacom promoted Neopets through  |minishows|Interstitial_Program|  on  |Nickelodeon|Nickelodeon| . Promotions included the second Altador Cup and led to an increase in traffic through the site. The first Altador Cup was released as an international online gaming event to coincide with the  |2006_FIFA_World_Cup|2006_Fifa_World_Cup|  to improve interactivity between users and had 10.4 million participants the first year. On July 17, the NC Mall was launched in a partnership with Korean gaming company  |Nexon_Corporation|Nexon_Corporation| . It allowed users to use real money to purchase Neocash to buy exclusive virtual items. On June 17, 2008, Viacom formed the  |Nickelodeon_Kids_&_Family_Virtual_Worlds_Group|Nickelodeon_Kids_&_Family_Virtual_Worlds_Group|  to encompass all paid and subscription gaming initiatives across all relevant platforms , including Neopets. By June 2011, Neopets announced that the website had logged 1 trillion page views since its creation.     In July 2009, the Neopets site was the target of an  |identity_theft|Identity_Theft|  hacking scheme that attempted to trick users into clicking a link that would allow them to gain items or Neopoints. Upon doing so,  |malware|Malware|  was installed onto the users computer. According to reports, the hack was aimed not at child players Neopets accounts, but at using the malware to steal the financial data and identities of their parents. Viacom stated that it was investigating the issue, and that the hack was a version of  |social_engineering|Social_Engineering|  rather than an indictment of Neopets security practices . In an on-site newsletter for players, Neopets denied the report and claimed that the sites security measures prevented the posting of such links.        |JumpStart|Jumpstart|  acquired Neopets from  |Viacom|Viacom|  in April 2014. Server migration began in September. JumpStart-owned Neopets was immediately characterized by glitches and site lag. On 6 March 2015, much of the Neopets Team remaining from Viacom were laid off.  On July 3, 2017, Chinese company  |NetDragon|Netdragon_Websoft|  acquired JumpStart.          On the weekend of 27–28 June 2015, the sites chat filters, designed to prevent adult language and content, stopped working. The sites forums and other user-edited spaces were flooded with adult content and obscene images.      In a statement on  |Facebook|Facebook| , JumpStart apologized, explaining that the issue was due to a facility move, and that during that move, the moderation team was not able to access the Neopets community.        In 2016, Motherboard reported that the login data of 70 million Neopets accounts was stolen.  It contained not only usernames and passwords but also email addresses, birth dates, IP addresses, and PINs. It turned out this information was being stored in plain text by Neopets and had first been retrieved in 2012; every single account created prior to that year was affected. Neopets responded by posting about the leak on their official Facebook page and sent emails out to all affected players telling them to change their passwords.       Neopets is consistently one of the  |stickiest|Sticky_Content|  sites for childrens entertainment. Stickiness is a measure of the average amount of time spent on a website. A press release from Neopets in 2001 stated that Neopets.com led in site stickiness in May and June, with the average user spending 117  minutes a week. Neopets also led in the average number of hours spent per user per month in December 2003 with an average of 4 hours and 47  minutes. A 2004 article stated that  |Nielsen//NetRatings|Nielsen_Ratings|  reported that people were spending around three hours a month on Neopets, more than any other site in its Nielsen category. By May 2005, a Neopets-affiliated video game producer cited about 35 million unique users, 11 million unique IP addresses per month, and 4 billion web page views per month. This producer also described 20% of the users as 18 or older, with the median of the remaining 80% at about 14. Neopets was consistently ranked among the top ten stickiest sites by both Nielsen//NetRatings and  |comScore_Media_Metrix|Comscore|  in 2005 and 2006. According to Nielsen//NetRatings, in 2007, Neopets lost about 15% of its audience over the previous year. In February 2008, comScore ranked it as the stickiest kids entertainment site with the average user spending 2 hours and 45  minutes per month.     Described as an online cross of  Pokémon  and  Tamagotchi , Neopets has received both praise and criticism. It has been praised for having educational content. Children can learn  |HTML|Html|  to edit their own pages. They can also learn how to handle money by participating in the economy. Reviews from  |About.com|About.Com|  and MMO Hut considered the multitude of possible activities a positive aspect.  |Most_of_the_users_are_female|Women_And_Video_Games| , higher than in other  |massively_multiplayer_online_games|Massively_Multiplayer_Online_Game|  but equivalent to  |social-networking|Social-Networking| -driven communities. Lucy Bradshaw, a vice president of  |Electronic_Arts|Electronic_Arts| , attributes the popularity among girls to the openness of the site and said, Games that have a tendency to satisfy on more than one dimension have a tendency to have a broader appeal and attract girls .     Luck & chance games draw criticism from parents as they introduce children to gambling. In Australia, a cross- |promotion|Promotion|  with  |McDonalds|Mcdonalds|  led to controversy with Neopets luck/chance games in October 2004. Australian tabloid television show  |Today_Tonight|Today_Tonight|  featured a nine-year-old boy who claimed the site requires one to gamble in order to earn enough Neopoints to feed ones Neopet or else it would be sent to the pound . While gambling is not required, nor are pets sent to the pound if unfed, the website includes games of chance based on real games such as blackjack and lottery scratchcard s. After this incident, Neopets prohibited users under the age of 13 from playing most games that involve gambling.         Immersive advertising is a trademarked term for the way Neopets displayed advertisements to generate profit after Doug Dohring bought the site. Unlike pop-up and banner ad s, immersive ads integrate advertisements into the sites content in interactive forms , including games and items. Players could earn Neopoints from them by playing advergames and taking part in online marketing surveys. Prior to the arrival of the NC Mall, it contributed to 60% of the revenue from the site with paying Fortune 1000 companies including Disney , General Mills , and McDonalds .     It was a contentious issue with the site with regard to the ethics of marketing to children . It drew criticism from parents, psychologists, and consumer advocates who argued that children may not know that they are being advertised to, as it blurred the line between site content and advertisement. Children under eight had difficulty recognizing ads and half a million of the 25 million users were under the age of eight in 2005. Dohring responded to such criticism stating that of the 40 percent of users twelve and younger, very few were seven or eight years old and that preschoolers were not their target audience.     Others criticised the functionality of the site. Susan Linn, another psychologist and author of Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood considered the purpose of this site was to keep children in front of advertisements. Kalle Lasn , editor-in-chief and co-founder of  |Adbusters|Adbusters|  magazine, said the site encouraged kids to spend hours in front of a screen and recruited them to consumerism . Neopets executives stated that paid content comprised less than 1% of the sites total content. Children were not required to play or use sponsor games and items, and all ads were marked as such.     After Neopets was purchased by Viacom, and due to criticism towards the immersive advertising model, banner advertisements and other more clear-cut forms of advertising were integrated into the site. Neocash was also introduced as an additional revenue source.       The popularity of Neopets spawned real-world merchandise including stickers, books, cereals, video game s and more, sold at mainstream outlets and online retailers. The most common items were plushies . Neopets products. Neopets.

Neopets, Inc. had always planned to bring the online and offline worlds together in ways that have never been done before . An investment banker at Allen & Company in New York said that Neopets was the only online media he had seen that might have the ability to capture market share in the offline world . Merchandise has been almost entirely discontinued save for a line of enamel pins released by Overpowered in 2018. Enamel Pins https://overpowered.life/collections/neopets     Neopets, Inc. signed various licensing deals with companies such as Viacom Consumer Products, Thinkway Toys, and Jakks Pacific over the years. Wizards of the Coast released the  |Neopets_Trading_Card_Game|Neopets_Trading_Card_Game|  in September 2003, which was promoted in three of General Mills Big G cereals and ten Simon Property Group malls. It received two different nominations for Toy of the Year as well as other recognitions. Neopets: The Official Magazine was a bi-monthly magazine released the same month but it was replaced in 2008 by Beckett Plushie Pals, which featured Neopets news as well as other companies products such as Webkinz .     In 2005, Neopets expanded to film and video game deals. The first movie was to be written by Ron Lieber and produced by Dylan Sellers and John A. Davis , but the project has since been cancelled with no other projects announced. Two video games were released by Sony Computer Entertainment,  |Neopets:_The_Darkest_Faerie|Neopets:_The_Darkest_Faerie|  for the PlayStation 2 in 2005 and  |Neopets:_Petpet_Adventures:_The_Wand_of_Wishing|Neopets:_Petpet_Adventures:_The_Wand_Of_Wishing|  for the PlayStation Portable in 2006. 2006 also saw the release of Neopets mobile, which allowed users to visit the new land of Lutari Island, but it was discontinued on June 30, 2009, leaving the island completely inaccessible. In 2007, MumboJumbo developed a match-3 game Neopets: Codestone Quest. Neopets wouldnt attempt another mobile game until 2015, when they released a match-3 game called Ghoul Catchers for Android and iOS. However, they still released other games during those years, including Treasure Keepers for Facebook and  |Puzzle_Adventure|Neopets_Puzzle_Adventure|  for Nintendo DS , Wii , and PC. In early 2019, Jumpstart announced that they were making a full mobile-friendly Neopets app, and it was scheduled to launch late in the summer of 2019.
