               is an  |East_Asian_language|East_Asian_Language|  spoken by about 128 million people, primarily in  |Japan|Japan| , where it is the  |national_language|National_Language| . It is a member of the  |Japonic|Japonic_Languages|   language family, and  |its_relation|Classification_Of_The_Japonic_Languages|  to other languages, such as  |Korean|Korean_Language| , is debated. Japanese has been grouped with language families such as  |Ainu|Ainu_Languages| ,  |Austroasiatic|Austroasiatic_Languages| , and the now-discredited  |Altaic|Altaic_Languages| , but none of these proposals has gained widespread acceptance.     Little is known of the languages prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the  |Heian_period|Heian_Period|  ,  |Chinese|Chinese_Language|  had considerable influence on the  |vocabulary|Sino_Japanese_Vocabulary|  and  |phonology|Phonology|  of  |Old_Japanese|Old_Japanese| .  |Late_Middle_Japanese|Late_Middle_Japanese|  included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, and the first appearance of  |European_loanwords|Gairaigo| . The standard dialect moved from the  |Kansai|Kansai|  region to the  |Edo|Edo|   region in the  |Early_Modern_Japanese|Early_Modern_Japanese|  period . Following the end in 1853 of  |Japans_self_imposed_isolation|Sakoku| , the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords, in particular, have become frequent, and  |Japanese_words_from_English_roots|Wasei_Eigo|  have proliferated.     Japanese is an  |agglutinative|Agglutinative_Language| ,  |mora|Mora_Japanese| -timed language with simple  |phonotactics|Phonotactics| , a  |pure|Monophthong|  vowel system, phonemic  |vowel|Vowel_Lengthphonemic_Vowel_Length|  and  |consonant|Gemination|  length, and a lexically significant  |pitch_accent|Japanese_Pitch_Accent| . Word order is normally  |subject–object–verb|Subject–Object–Verb|  with  |particles|Japanese_Particles|  marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is  |topic–comment|Topic–Comment| .  |Sentence_final_particles|Sentence_Final_Particle|  are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or make questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no  |articles|Article| . Verbs are  |conjugated|Japanese_Verb_Conjugation| , primarily for  |tense|Grammatical_Tense|  and  |voice|Voice| , but not  |person|Grammatical_Person| .  |Japanese_equivalents_of_adjectives|Japanese_Equivalents_Of_Adjectives|  are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of  |honorifics|Honorific_Speech_In_Japanese|  with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.     Japanese has no  |genetic_relationship|Genetic_Relationship|  with  |Chinese|Chinese_Language| ,  but it makes extensive use of  |Chinese_characters|Chinese_Characters| , or , in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is  |borrowed_from_Chinese|Sino_Japanese_Vocabulary| . Along with kanji, the  |Japanese_writing_system|Japanese_Writing_System|  primarily uses two  |syllabic|Syllabary|   scripts,  and .  |Latin_script|Latin_Script|  is used in a limited fashion, such as for imported acronyms, and the  |numeral_system|Japanese_Numerals|  uses mostly  |Arabic_numerals|Arabic_Numerals|  alongside traditional  |Chinese_numerals|Chinese_Numerals| .           Proto-Japonic, the common ancestor of the Japanese and Ryukyuan languages, is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from either continental Asia or nearby Pacific islands sometime in the early- to mid-2nd century BC , replacing the languages of the original  |Jōmon|Jōmon_People|  inhabitants,  including the ancestor of the modern  |Ainu_language|Ainu_Language| . Very little is known about the Japanese of this period. Because writing like the Kanji which later devolved into the writing systems Hiragana and Katakana had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period of Japanese must be based on the reconstructions of  |Old_Japanese|Old_Japanese| .             Old Japanese is the oldest attested stage of the Japanese language. Through the spread of  |Buddhism|Buddhism| , the Chinese writing system was imported to Japan. The earliest texts found in Japan are written in  |Classical_Chinese|Classical_Chinese| , but they may have been meant to be read as Japanese by the  |kanbun|Kanbun|  method. Some of these Chinese texts show the influences of Japanese grammar, such as the word order . In these hybrid texts,  |Chinese_characters|Chinese_Characters|  are also occasionally used phonetically to represent  |Japanese_particles|Japanese_Particles| . The earliest text, the  Kojiki , dates to the early 8th century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters. The end of Old Japanese coincides with the end of the  |Nara_period|Nara_Period|  in 794. Old Japanese uses the  |Manyōgana|Manyōgana|  system of writing, which uses kanji for their phonetic as well as semantic values. Based on the Manyōgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct syllables. Texts written with Manyōgana use two different kanji for each of the syllables now pronounced . Shinkichi Hashimoto 「国語仮名遣研究史上の一発見―石塚龍麿の仮名遣奥山路について」『帝国文学』26–11『文字及び仮名遣の研究』。  This set of syllables shrank to 67 in  |Early_Middle_Japanese|Early_Middle_Japanese| , though some were added through Chinese influence.     Due to these extra syllables, it has been hypothesized that Old Japaneses vowel system was larger than that of Modern Japanese – it perhaps contained up to eight vowels. According to  |Shinkichi_Hashimoto|Shinkichi_Hashimoto| , the extra syllables in Manyōgana derive from differences between the vowels of the syllables in question. 大野 晋 『上代仮名遣の研究』 p.126 These differences would indicate that Old Japanese had an eight-vowel system, 大野 晋 『仮名遣いと上代語』 p.65 in contrast to the five vowels of later Japanese. The vowel system would have to have shrunk some time between these texts and the invention of the  kana   in the early 9th century. According to this view, the eight-vowel system of ancient Japanese would resemble that of the Uralic and  |Altaic_language|Altaic_Language|  families. 有坂 秀世 「国語にあらはれる一種の母音交替について」『音声の研究』第4輯 .
