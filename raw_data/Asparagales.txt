     Asparagales  is an  |order|Order|  of plants in modern classification systems such as the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  and the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Web|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Web| . The order takes its name from the  |type|Type| |family|Family| |Asparagaceae|Asparagaceae|  and is placed in the  |monocots|Monocots|  amongst the  |lilioid_monocots|Lilioid_Monocots| . The order has only recently been recognized in classification systems. It was first put forward by  |Huber|Herbert_Huber|  in 1977 and later taken up in the  |Dahlgren_system|Dahlgren_System|  of 1985 and then the APG in 1998, 2003 and 2009. Before this, many of its families were assigned to the old order  |Liliales|Liliales| , a very large order containing almost all monocots with colourful  |tepals|Tepal|  and lacking  |starch|Starch|  in their  |endosperm|Endosperm| .  |DNA_sequence_analysis|Dna_Sequencing|  indicated that many of the taxa previously included in Liliales should actually be redistributed over three orders, Liliales, Asparagales and  |Dioscoreales|Dioscoreales| . The boundaries of the Asparagales and of its families have undergone a series of changes in recent years; future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability. In the APG  |circumscription|Circumscription| , Asparagales is the largest order of monocots with 14 families, 1,122  |genera|Genus| , and about 36,000  |species|Species| .     The order is clearly  |circumscribed|Circumscribed|  on the basis of  |molecular_phylogenetics|Molecular_Phylogenetics| , but is difficult to define  |morphologically|Plant_Morphology| , since its members are structurally diverse. Most species of Asparagales are  |herbaceous|Herbaceous| |perennials|Perennial| , although some are  |climbers|Vines|  and some are tree-like. The order also contains many  |geophytes|Geophyte|  . According to  |telomere_sequence|Telomere| , at least two evolutionary switch-points happened within the order. Basal sequence is formed by TTTAGGG like in majority of higher plants. Basal motif was changed to vertebrate-like TTAGGG and finally the most divergent motif CTCGGTTATGGG appears in Allium. One of the defining characteristics  of the order is the presence of  |phytomelanin|Phytomelanin| , a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust. Phytomelanin is found in most families of the Asparagales .     The  |leaves|Leaf|  of almost all species form a tight  |rosette|Rosette| , either at the base of the plant or at the end of the  |stem|Plant_Stem| , but occasionally along the stem. The  |flowers|Flower|  are not particularly distinctive, being lily type, with six  |tepals|Tepal|  and up to six  |stamina|Stamen| .     The order is thought to have first  |diverged|Genetic_Divergence|  from other related monocots some 120–130 million years ago , although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved, estimates are likely to be uncertain.     From an economic point of view, the order Asparagales is second in importance within the monocots to the order  |Poales|Poales|  . Species are used as food and flavourings , as  |cut_flowers|Cut_Flowers|  , and as garden  |ornamentals|Ornamental_Plant|  .                    Although most species in the order are  |herbaceous|Herbaceous_Plant| , some no more than 15  cm high, there are a number of  |climbers|Vines|  , as well as several genera forming  |trees|Tree|  , which can exceed 10  m in height.  |Succulent|Succulent|  genera occur in several families .     Almost all species have a tight cluster of  |leaves|Leaf|  , either at the base of the plant or at the end of a more-or-less woody  |stem|Plant_Stem|  as with  Yucca . In some cases the leaves are produced along the stem. The  |flowers|Flower|  are in the main not particularly distinctive, being of a general lily type, with six  |tepals|Tepal| , either free or fused from the base and up to six  |stamina|Stamen| . They are frequently clustered at the end of the plant stem.     The Asparagales are generally distinguished from the  |Liliales|Liliales|  by the lack of markings on the tepals, the presence of  |septal_nectaries|Septal_Nectaries|  in the  |ovaries|Ovary| , rather than the bases of the tepals or stamen filaments, and the presence of  |secondary_growth|Secondary_Growth| . They are generally  |geophytes|Geophytes| , but with linear leaves, and a lack of fine  |reticular_venation|Reticular_Venation| .     The  |seeds|Seed|  characteristically have the external epidermis either obliterated , or if present, have a layer of black carbonaceous  |phytomelanin|Phytomelanin|  in species with dry fruits . The inner part of the seed coat is generally collapsed, in contrast to Liliales whose seeds have a well developed outer epidermis, lack phytomelanin, and usually display a cellular inner layer.     The orders which have been separated from the old Liliales are difficult to characterize. No single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order Asparagales.   The flowers of Asparagales are of a general type among the  |lilioid_monocots|Lilioid_Monocot| . Compared to Liliales, they usually have plain  |tepals|Tepal|  without markings in the form of dots. If  |nectaries|Nectary|  are present, they are in the  |septa|Septum|  of the  |ovaries|Ovary|  rather than at the base of the tepals or  |stamens|Stamen| .   Those species which have relatively large dry seeds have a dark, crust-like outer layer containing the pigment phytomelan. However, some species with hairy seeds , berries , or highly reduced seeds lack this dark pigment in their seed coats. Phytomelan is not unique to Asparagales  but it is common within the order and rare outside it. The inner portion of the seed coat is usually completely collapsed. In contrast, the morphologically similar seeds of Liliales have no phytomelan, and usually retain a cellular structure in the inner portion of the seed coat.  |meristem|Meristem|  present in other angiosperm groups. Asparagales have a method of secondary thickening which is otherwise only found in Dioscorea  . In a process called anomalous secondary growth, they are able to create new vascular bundles around which thickening growth occurs.  Agave ,  Yucca ,  Aloe ,  Dracaena ,  Nolina  and  Cordyline  can become massive trees, albeit not of the height of the tallest dicots, and with less branching. Other genera in the order, such as  Lomandra  and  Aphyllanthes , have the same type of secondary growth but confined to their underground stems.    |Microsporogenesis|Microsporogenesis|   distinguishes some members of Asparagales from Liliales. Microsporogenesis involves a cell dividing twice  to form four daughter cells. There are two kinds of microsporogenesis: successive and simultaneous . In successive microsporogenesis, walls are laid down separating the daughter cells after each division. In simultaneous microsporogenesis, there is no wall formation until all four cell  |nuclei|Nucleus|  are present. Liliales all have successive microsporogenesis, which is thought to be the primitive condition in monocots. It seems that when the Asparagales first diverged they developed simultaneous microsporogenesis, which the lower Asparagale families retain. However, the core Asparagales  have reverted to successive microsporogenesis.  |telomeres|Telomere|  . The typical Arabidopsis-type sequence of bases has been fully or partially replaced by other sequences, with the human-type predominating. sdh3.         As  |circumscribed|Circumscription|  within the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  system Asparagales is the largest  |order|Order|  within the  |monocotyledons|Monocotyledons| , with 14 families, 1,122  |genera|Genus|  and about 25,000–42,000  |species|Species| , thus accounting for about 50% of all monocots and 10–15% of the  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plants|  . The attribution of botanical authority for the name Asparagales belongs to  |Johann_Heinrich_Friedrich_Link|Johann_Heinrich_Friedrich_Link|  who coined the word Asparaginae in 1829 for a higher order taxon that included  Asparagus  although Adanson and Jussieau had also done so earlier . Earlier circumscriptions of Asparagales attributed the name to  |Bromhead|Edward_Bromhead|  , who had been the first to use the term Asparagales.           The  |type_genus|Type_Genus| ,  Asparagus , from which the name of the order is derived, was described by Carl  |Linnaeus|Carl_Linnaeus|  in 1753, with ten species. He placed Asparagus within the Hexandria Monogynia  in his  |sexual_classification|Linnaean_Taxonomy|  in the  Species Plantarum . The majority of  |taxa|Taxa|  now considered to constitute Asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family,  |Liliaceae|Liliaceae| . The family Liliaceae was first described by  |Michel_Adanson|Michel_Adanson|  in 1763, and in  |his_taxonomic_scheme|Adanson_System|  he created eight sections within it, including the Asparagi with Asparagus and three other genera. The system of organising genera into families is generally credited to  |Antoine_Laurent_de_Jussieu|Antoine_Laurent_De_Jussieu|  who formally described both the Liliaceae and the type family of Asparagales, the  |Asparagaceae|Asparagaceae| , as Lilia and Asparagi, respectively, in 1789. Jussieu established the  |hierarchical|Hierarchical|  system of  |taxonomy|Taxonomy|  , placing Asparagus and related genera within a  |division|Division|  of  |Monocotyledons|Monocotyledons| , a  |class|Class|  of Stamina Perigynia and order Asparagi, divided into three subfamilies. The use of the term Ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. In creating  |his_scheme|De_Jussieu_System|  he used a modified form of Linnaeus sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers. While De Jussieus Stamina Perigynia also included a number of orders that would eventually form families within the Asparagales such as the Asphodeli , Narcissi  and Irides , the remainder are now allocated to other orders. Jussieus Asparagi soon came to be referred to as Asparagacées in the French literature . Meanwhile, the Narcissi had been renamed as the Amaryllidées in 1805, by  |Jean_Henri_Jaume_Saint-Hilaire|Jean_Henri_Jaume_Saint-Hilaire| , using  Amaryllis  as the type species rather than  Narcissus , and thus has the authority attribution for  |Amaryllidaceae|Amaryllidaceae| . In 1810  |Brown|Robert_Brown|  proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the  |ovaries|Ovary|  and be referred to as Amaryllideae and in 1813  |de_Candolle|De_Candolle|  described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.     The literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the English language with  |Samuel_Frederick_Grays|Samuel_Frederick_Gray|  A natural arrangement of British plants . Gray used a combination of Linnaeus sexual classification and Jussieus natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. Within the grouping he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. He treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as Amaryllideae, Liliaceae, Asphodeleae and Asparageae.        The  |circumscription|Circumscription|  of Asparagales has been a source of difficulty for many botanists from the time of  |John_Lindley|John_Lindley|  , the other important British taxonomist of the early nineteenth century. In his  |first_taxonomic_work|Lindley_System| , An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany  he partly followed Jussieu by describing a subclass he called Endogenae, or Monocotyledonous Plants  divided into two tribes, the  |Petaloidea|Petaloidea|  and  |Glumaceae|Glumaceae| . He divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the Liliaceae , but also most of the families considered to make up the Asparagales today, including the  |Amaryllideae|Amaryllideae| .     By 1846, in his final scheme Lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots, introducing both an intermediate ranking and tribes within orders . Lindley placed the Liliaceae within the  |Liliales|Liliales| , but saw it as a  |paraphyletic|Paraphyly|  family, being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. The order Liliales was very large and had become a used to include almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm . The Liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups. This kept the Liliaceae separate from the Amaryllidaceae . Of these Liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes and Amaryllidaceae into four tribes , yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each others contemporary orders . The Liliaceae would be reduced to a small core represented by the tribe Tulipae, while large groups such  |Scilleae|Scilleae|  and  |Asparagae|Asparagaceae|  would become part of Asparagales either as part of the Amaryllidaceae or as separate families. While of the Amaryllidaceae, the  |Agaveae|Agavaceae|  would be part of Asparagaceae but the  |Alstroemeriae|Alstroemeriaceae|  would become a family within the  |Liliales|Liliales| .     The number of known genera continued to grow and by the time of the next major British classification, that of  |Bentham_and_Hooker|Bentham_And_Hooker|  in 1883 several of Lindleys other families had been absorbed into the Liliaceae. They used the term series to indicate suprafamilial rank, with seven series of monocotyledons , but did not use Lindleys terms for these. However they did place the Liliaceous and Amaryllidaceous genera into separate series. The Liliaceae were placed in series Coronariae, while the Amaryllideae were placed in series Epigynae. The Liliaceae now consisted of twenty tribes , and the Amaryllideae of five . An important addition to the treatment of the Liliaceae was the recognition of the  |Allieae|Allieae|  as a distinct tribe that would eventually find its way to the Asparagales as the subfamily  |Allioideae|Allioideae|  of the Amaryllidaceae.       The appearance of  |Charles_Darwins|Charles_Darwin| |Origin_of_Species|Origin_Of_Species|  in 1859 changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. The  |Darwinian|Darwinian|  approach led to the concept of  |phylogeny|Phylogeny|  in assembling classification systems, starting with  |Eichler|Eichler_System| .  |Eichler|August_Eichler| , having established a  |hierarchical|Hierarchical|  system in which the flowering plants  were divided into  |monocotyledons|Monocotyledons|  and  |dicotyledons|Dicotyledons| , further divided into former into seven orders. Within the  |Liliiflorae|Liliiflorae|  were seven families, including Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. Liliaceae included  Allium  and  Ornithogalum   and  Asparagus .      |Engler|Adolf_Engler| , in his  |system|Engler_System|  developed Eichlers ideas into a much more elaborate scheme which he treated in a number of works including  Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien   and  Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien  . In his treatment of Liliiflorae the Liliineae were a suborder which included both families Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. The Liliaceae had eight subfamilies and the Amaryllidaceae four. In this rearrangement of Liliaceae, with fewer subdivisions, the core Liliales were represented as subfamily  |Lilioideae|Lilioideae|  , the Asparagae were represented as Asparagoideae and the  |Allioideae|Allioideae|  was preserved, representing the alliaceous genera.  |Allieae|Allieae| ,  |Agapantheae|Agapantheae|  and  |Gilliesieae|Gilliesieae|  were the three tribes within this subfamily. In the Amaryllidacea, there was little change from Bentham and Hooker. A similar approach was adopted by  |Wettstein|Richard_Wettstein| .       In the twentieth century the  |Wettstein_system|Wettstein_System|  placed many of the taxa in an order called Liliiflorae. Next  |Johannes_Paulus_Lotsy|Johannes_Paulus_Lotsy|  proposed dividing the  |Liliiflorae|Liliiflorae|  into a number of smaller families including  |Asparagaceae|Asparagaceae| . Then  |Herbert_Huber|Herbert_Huber|  , following Lotsys example, proposed that the Liliiflorae be split into four groups including the Asparagoid  |Liliiflorae|Liliiflorae| .   The widely used  |Cronquist_system|Cronquist_System|   used the very broadly defined order Liliales.     These various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact till that of  |Dahlgren|Dahlgren_System|  incorporating new information including  |synapomorphy|Synapomorphy| . Dahlgren developed Hubers ideas further and popularised them, with a major deconstruction of existing families into smaller units. They created a new  |order|Order| , calling it Asparagales. This was one of five orders within the superorder Liliiflorae. Where Cronquist saw one family, Dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders .   Over the 1980s, in the context of a more general review of the classification of  |angiosperms|Angiosperms| , the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. By the end of that decade, the  |Royal_Botanic_Gardens_at_Kew|Royal_Botanic_Gardens_At_Kew| , the  |British_Museum_of_Natural_History|British_Museum_Of_Natural_History|  and the  |Edinburgh_Botanical_Gardens|Edinburgh_Botanical_Gardens|  formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their  |herbaria|Herbaria| . That committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad Liliaceae, largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families.       The order Asparagales as currently  |circumscribed|Circumscription|  has only recently been recognized in classification systems, through the advent of  |phylogenetics|Phylogenetics| . The 1990s saw considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory, enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants. The establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as Cronquist and Thorne based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. This complicated discussion about plant evolution and necessitated a major restructuring. rbcL gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots had redefined the  |Liliales|Liliales|  in 1995. . from four morphological orders sensu  |Dahlgren|Rolf_Dahlgren| . The largest clade representing the Liliaceae, all previously included in Liliales, but including both the Calochortaceae and Liliaceae sensu Tamura. This redefined family, that became referred to as core Liliales, but corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  .       The 2009 revision of the  |Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|Angiosperm_Phylogeny_Group|  system,  |APG_III|Apg_Iii_System| , places the order in the clade  |monocots|Monocotyledon| .     From the  |Dahlgren_system|Dahlgren_System|  of 1985 onwards, studies based mainly on morphology had identified the Asparagales as a distinct group, but had also included groups now located in Liliales, Pandanales and Zingiberales. Research in the 21st century has supported the  |monophyly|Monophyly|  of Asparagales, based on morphology, 18S rDNA, and other DNA sequences, although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that Asparagales may be paraphyletic, with Orchidaceae separated from the rest. Within the monocots, Asparagales is the  |sister_group|Sister_Group|  of the  |commelinid|Commelinid|  clade.     This  |cladogram|Cladogram|  shows the placement of Asparagales within the orders of  |Lilianae|Lilianae|   sensu  Chase & Reveal based on molecular phylogenetic evidence. The  |lilioid_monocot|Lilioid_Monocot|  orders are bracketed, namely  |Petrosaviales|Petrosaviales| ,  |Dioscoreales|Dioscoreales| ,  |Pandanales|Pandanales| ,  |Liliales|Liliales|  and Asparagales. These constitute a  |paraphyletic|Paraphyly|  assemblage, that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants ; to form a clade, all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included. While Acorales and Alismatales have been collectively referred to as  |alismatid_monocots|Alismatid_Monocots|  , the remaining clades  have been referred to as the core monocots . The relationship between the orders is  |pectinate|Wikt:Pectinate| , that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids. Numbers indicate  |crown_group|Crown_Group|  divergence times in  |mya|Mya|  .                 A  |phylogenetic_tree|Phylogenetic_Tree|  for the Asparagales, generally to family level, but including groups which were recently and widely treated as families but which are now reduced to subfamily rank, is shown below.          The tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group, the lower Asparagales , from Orchidaceae to Asphodelaceae, and a well-supported monophyletic group of core Asparagales , comprising the two largest families, Amaryllidaceae sensu lato and Asparagaceae sensu lato.     Two differences between these two groups are: the mode of  |microsporogenesis|Microsporogenesis|  and the position of the ovary. The lower Asparagales typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis , which appears to be an  |apomorphy|Apomorphy|  within the monocots, whereas the core Asparagales have reverted to successive microsporogenesis . The lower Asparagales typically have an  |inferior_ovary|Inferior_Ovary| , whereas the core Asparagales have reverted to a  |superior_ovary|Superior_Ovary| . A 2002 morphological study by Rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a  |synapomorphy|Synapomorphy|  of the Asparagales, stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the core Asparagales could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries. However, Stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the lower Asparagales in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies. The position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character  than previously thought.       The  |APG_III_system|Apg_Iii_System|  when it was published in 2009, greatly expanded the families  |Xanthorrhoeaceae|Xanthorrhoeaceae| ,  |Amaryllidaceae|Amaryllidaceae| , and  |Asparagaceae|Asparagaceae| . Thirteen of the families of the earlier  |APG_II_system|Apg_Ii_System|  were thereby reduced to subfamilies within these three families. The expanded Xanthorrhoeaceae is now called Asphodelaceae . The APG II families and their equivalent APG III subfamilies are as follows:               |Orchidaceae|Orchidaceae|  is the largest family of all  |angiosperms|Angiosperm|  and hence by far the largest in the order. The  |Dahlgren_system|Dahlgren_System|  recognized three families of orchids, but DNA sequence analysis later showed that these families are  |polyphyletic|Polyphyletic|  and so should be combined. Several studies suggest that Orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the Asparagales. Other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree, generally among the  |Boryaceae|Boryaceae| - |Hypoxidaceae|Hypoxidaceae|  clade. The position of Orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis, but cannot be taken as confirmed.     Orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries, two characters that are typical of the lower Asparagales. However, their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries, and most orchids have dust-like seeds, atypical of the rest of the order.      In terms of the number of species, Orchidaceae diversification is remarkable. However, although the other Asparagales may be less rich in species, they are more variable morphologically, including tree-like forms.      |Boryaceae|Boryaceae|  form a well-supported clade in studies based on DNA sequence analysis. All four contain relatively few species, and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name Hypoxidaceae sensu lato. The relationship between Boryaceae , and other Asparagales has remained unclear for a long time. The Boryaceae are  |mycorrhiza|Mycorrhiza| l, but not in the same way as orchids. Morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between Boryaceae and Blandfordiaceae. There is relatively low support for the position of Boryaceae in the tree shown above.      |Ixioliriaceae|Ixioliriaceae|  and  |Tecophilaeaceae|Tecophilaeaceae|  is still unclear. Some studies have supported a clade of these two families, others have not. The position of  |Doryanthaceae|Doryanthaceae|  has also varied, with support for the position shown above, but also support for other positions.     The clade from  |Iridaceae|Iridaceae|  upwards appears to have stronger support. All have some genetic characteristics in common, having lost Arabidopsis-type  |telomeres|Telomere| . Iridaceae is distinctive among the Asparagales in the unique structure of the  |inflorescence|Inflorescence|  , the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens, and the common occurrence of unifacial leaves whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other Asparagales.     Members of the clade from  |Iridaceae|Iridaceae|  upwards have infra-locular septal nectaries, which Rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries.     sensu lato + the core Asparagalesfamily Asphodelaceaeplantfamily Asparagaceae sensu lato Dahlgren had 31including Agapanthaceae F.Voigt , Alliaceae Borkh. e.g. in the  |APG_II_system|Apg_Ii_System| including Agavaceae Dumort. , Aphyllanthaceae Burnett , Hesperocallidaceae Traub , Hyacinthaceae Batsch ex Borkh. , Laxmanniaceae Bubani , Ruscaceae M.Roem. and Themidaceae Salisb. including Asphodelaceae Juss. and Hemerocallidaceae R.Br. see below  |n|N| |a|A|.
