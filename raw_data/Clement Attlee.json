In 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, The Social Worker, which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30: In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community. , archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.     and went on to say at page 75: Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals.

Labour campaigned on the theme of Let Us Face the Future , positioning themselves as the party best placed to rebuild Britain after the war,  and were widely viewed as having run a strong and positive campaign, while the Conservative campaign centred entirely around Churchill. Despite opinion polls indicating a strong Labour lead, opinion polls were then viewed as a novelty which had not proven their worth, and most commentators expected that Churchills prestige and status as a war hero would ensure a comfortable Conservative victory.

To assist home ownership, the limit on the amount of money that people could borrow from their local authority to purchase or build a home was raised from £800 to £1,500 in 1945, and to £5,000 in 1949. Fifty Facts on Housing , published by the Labour Party, Transport House, Smith Square, London SW1, February 1951 Under the National Assistance act of 1948, local authorities had a duty to provide emergency temporary accommodation for families which become homeless through no fault of their own . Socially Deprived Families in Britain , first published in 1970 .     A large house-building programme was carried out with the intention of providing millions of people with high-quality homes. A housing bill passed in 1946 increased Treasury subsidies for the construction of local authority housing in England and Wales. Harmer, Harry. The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900–1998. Four out of five houses constructed under Labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the Second World War, and subsidies kept down council rents. Altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest-ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. Although the Attlee government failed to meet its targets, primarily due to economic constraints, over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.       A number of reforms were embarked upon to improve conditions for women and children. In 1946, universal family allowances were introduced to provide financial support to households for raising children.   These benefits had been legislated for the previous year by Churchills ": null

        ", and was the first measure pushed through parliament by Attlees government.  Conservatives would later criticise Labour for having been too hasty in introducing family allowances.     A Married Women Act was passed in 1949 to equalise, to render inoperative any restrictions upon anticipation or alienation attached to the enjoyment of property by a woman , while the Married Women Act of 1949 was enacted with the intention of improving the adequacy and duration of financial benefits for married women.      The Criminal Law Act of 1950 amended an Act of 1885 to bring prostitutes within the law and safeguard them from abduction and abuse.  The Criminal Justice Act of 1948 restricted imprisonment for juveniles and brought improvements to the probation and remand centres systems, while the passage of the Justices of the Peace Act of 1949 led to extensive reforms of magistrates courts. The Longman Companion to the Labour Party, 1900–1998 by H.  J.  P. Harmer The Attlee government also abolished the marriage bar in the Civil Service, thereby enabling married women to work in that institution.      In 1946, the government set up a National Institute of Houseworkers as a means of providing a social democratic variety of domestic service. Francis, Martin. Ideas and Policies Under Labour, 1945–1951.     By late 1946, agreed standards of training were established, which was followed by the opening of a training headquarters and the opening of an additional nine training centres in Wales, Scotland, and then throughout Great Britain. The National Health Service Act of 1946 indicated that domestic help should be provided for households where that help is required owing to the presence of any person who is ill, lying-in, an expectant mother, mentally defective, aged or a child not over compulsory school age . Home help therefore included the provision of home-helps for nursing and expectant mothers and for mothers with children under the age of five, and by 1952 some 20,000 women were engaged in this service.        Development rights were nationalised while the government attempted to take all development profits for the State. Strong planning authorities were set up to control land use, and issued manuals of guidance which stressed the importance of safeguarding agricultural land. A chain of regional offices was set up within its planning ministry to provide a strong lead in regional development policies. Labour and Inequality: Sixteen Fabian Essays .     Comprehensive Development Areas , a designation under the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947, allowed local authorities to acquire property in the designated areas using powers of compulsory purchase in order to re-plan and develop urban areas suffering from urban blight or war damage.        Various measures were carried out to improve conditions in the workplace. Entitlement to sick leave was greatly extended, and sick pay schemes were introduced for local authority administrative, professional and technical workers in 1946 and for various categories of manual workers in 1948.

The Shops Act of 1950 consolidated previous legislation which provided that no one could be employed in a shop for more than six hours without having a break for at least 20 minutes. The legislation also required a lunch break of at least 45 minutes for anyone for worked between 11:30  am and 2:30  pm and a half-hour tea break for anyone working between 4  pm and 7  pm.  The government also strengthened a Fair Wages Resolution, with a clause that required all employers getting government contracts to recognise the rights of their workers to join trade unions.

This scheme gave registered dockers the legal right to minimum work and decent conditions. Through the National Dock Labour Board the unions acquired control over recruitment and dismissal. Registered dockers laid off by employers within the Scheme had the right either to be taken on by another, or to generous compensation.  All dockers were registered under the Dock Labour Scheme, giving them a legal right to minimum work, holidays and sick pay.      Wages for members of the police force were significantly increased.  The introduction of a Miners Charter in 1946 instituted a five-day work week for miners and a standardised day wage structure, and in 1948 a Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme was approved, providing supplementary allowances to disabled coal-workers and their dependants.  Social security in Britain, Great Britain, Central Office of Information, Reference Division, H.M.

Under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Regulations of 1950, a pension scheme for mineworkers was established.  Improvements were also made in farmworkers wages, and the Agricultural Wages Board in 1948 not only safeguarded wage levels, but also ensured that workers were provided with accommodation.      A number of regulations aimed at safeguarding the health and safety of people at work were also introduced during Attlees time in office. Regulations issued in February 1946 applied to factories involved with manufacturing briquettes or blocks of fuel consisting of coal, coal dust, coke or slurry with pitch as a binding substance , and concerned dust and ventilation, washing facilities and clothing accommodation, medical supervision and examination, skin and eye protection and messrooms .

As noted by Martin Francis:   Union leaders saw nationalisation as a means to pursue a more advantageous position within a framework of continued conflict, rather than as an opportunity to replace the old adversarial form of industrial relations. Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialists relationships in the workplace.       The Attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the ": null

        " established a more generous subsidy system for farmers. Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.  Self, Peter & Herbert J. Storing. The State and the Farmer.     Attlees government made it possible for farm workers to borrow up to 90 per cent of the cost of building their own houses, and received a subsidy of £15 a year for 40 years towards that cost. Grants were also made to meet up to half the cost of supplying water to farm buildings and fields, the government met half the cost of bracken eradication and lime spreading, and grants were paid for bringing hill farming land into use that had previously been considered unfit for farming purposes.     In 1946, the National Agricultural Advisory Service was set up to supply agricultural advice and information. The Hill Farming Act of 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. The act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1948 enabled tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. In addition, the Livestock Rearing Act of March 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 Hill Farming Act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector.     At a time of world food shortages, it was vital that farmers produced the maximum possible quantities. The government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation, while the National Agricultural Advisory Service provided expertise and price guarantees. As a result of the Attlee governments initiatives in agriculture, there was a 20 per cent increase in output between 1947 and 1952, while Britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world.       The Attlee government ensured provisions of the Education Act 1944 were fully implemented, with free secondary education becoming a right for the first time. Fees in state grammar schools were eliminated, while new, modern secondary schools were constructed. Hopkins, Eric. Industrialisation and Society: A Social History, 1830–1951.     The school leaving age was raised to 15 in 1947, an accomplishment helped brought into fruition by initiatives such as the H.O.R.S.A. scheme and the S.F.O.R.S.A. scheme. University scholarships were introduced to ensure that no one who was qualified “should be deprived of a university education for financial reasons,” while a large school building programme was organised. A rapid increase in the number of trained teachers took place, and the number of new school places was increased.     Increased Treasury funds were made available for education, particularly for upgrading school buildings suffering from years of neglect and war damage. Jefferys, Kevin. The Labour Party since 1945. Prefabricated classrooms were built and 928 new primary schools were constructed between 1945 and 1950. The provision of free school meals was expanded, and opportunities for university entrants were increased. Hartley, Cathy. A Historical Dictionary of British Women. State scholarships to universities were increased, Pelling, Henry & Alastair J. Reid. A Short History of the Labour Party. and the government adopted a policy of supplementing university scholarships awards to a level sufficient to cover fees plus maintenance.     Many thousands of ex-servicemen were assisted to go through college who could never have contemplated it before the war. Free milk was also made available to all schoolchildren for the first time. Oddy, Derek J. From Plain Fare to Fusion Food: British Diet from the 1890s to the 1990s. In addition, spending on technical education rose, and the number of nursery schools was increased. Salaries for teachers were also improved, and funds were allocated towards improving existing schools.     In 1947, the Arts Council of Great Britain was set up to encourage the arts.     A Ministry of Education was established, and free County Colleges were set up for the compulsory part-time instruction of teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18 who were not in full-time education. Hodge, B. & W.  L. Mellor. Higher School Certificate History. An Emergency Training Scheme was also introduced which turned out an extra 25,000 teachers in 1945–1951. In 1947, Regional Advisory Councils were set up to bring together industry and education to find out the needs of young workers and advise on the provision required, and to secure reasonable economy of provision . Whitakers Almanack, J. Whitaker & Sons, 1987 That same year, thirteen Area Training Organisations were set up in England and one in Wales to coordinate teacher training.     Attlees government, however, failed to introduce the comprehensive education for which many socialists had hoped. This reform was eventually carried out by Harold Wilsons government. During its time in office, the Attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent, from £6.5  billion to £10  billion.       The most significant problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the war effort had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of her national wealth. Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the balance of trade . This resulted in strict rationing of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its financial state.     The abrupt end of the American Lend-Lease program in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. Some relief was provided by the Anglo-American loan , negotiated in December 1945. The conditions attached to the loan included making the pound fully convertible to the US dollar. When this was introduced in July 1947, it led to a currency crisis and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks. The UK benefited from the American Marshall Aid program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. Another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stafford Cripps , into devaluation of the pound.     Despite these problems, one of the main achievements of Attlees government was the maintenance of near full employment . The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3 per cent of the total workforce. Labour shortages proved a more frequent problem. The inflation rate was also kept low during his term. The rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2 per cent during Attlees time in office, whilst there was no hard-core of long-term unemployed. Both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment, while the average working week was shortened. Thompson, David. England in the Twentieth Century .     The government was less successful in housing, which was the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan . The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the Attlee governments housing policies. Between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.     When the Attlee government was voted out of office in 1951, the economy had been improved compared to 1945. The period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards, which increased by about 10 per cent each year. During that same period, the economy grew by 3 per cent a year, and by 1951 the UK had the best economic performance in Europe, while output per person was increasing faster than in the United States . Ten Years of New Labour Careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery, and that unemployment stayed at very low levels. In addition, the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3  million to 5  million from 1945 to 1951, and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before. A Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act was passed in 1948, which allowed for investigations of restrictive practices and monopolies.       1947 proved a particularly difficult year for the government; an exceptionally cold winter that year caused coal mines to freeze and cease production, creating widespread power cuts and food shortages. The Minister of Fuel and Power , Emanuel Shinwell was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks, and soon resigned from his post. The Conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan Starve with Strachey and shiver with Shinwell .     The crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by Hugh Dalton to replace Attlee as Prime Minister with Ernest Bevin . Later that year Stafford Cripps tried to persuade Attlee to stand aside for Bevin. These plots petered out after Bevin refused to cooperate. Later that year, Hugh Dalton resigned as Chancellor after inadvertently leaking details of the budget to a journalist. He was replaced by Cripps.       thu and Joseph Stalin at the Potsdam Conference , 1945   thu upon his arrival at National Airport in Washington, 1945         In foreign affairs, the Attlee government was concerned with four main issues; post-war Europe, the onset of the Cold War, the establishment of the United Nations, and decolonisation. The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted by Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin . Attlee also attended the later stages of the Potsdam Conference , where he negotiated with President Harry S. Truman and Joseph Stalin .     In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britains former war-time ally, Stalin and the Soviet Union . Ernest Bevin was a passionate anti-communist , based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. Bevins initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary was wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile . Attlee himself sought warm relations with Stalin. He put his trust in the United Nations, rejected notions that the Soviet Union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating Moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. This put Attlee at swords point with his foreign minister, the Foreign Office, and the military who all saw the Soviets as a growing threat to Britains role in the Middle East. Suddenly in January 1947, Attlee reversed his position and agreed with Bevin on a hard-line anti-Soviet policy.     In an early good-will gesture that was later heavily criticised, the Attlee government allowed the Soviets to purchase, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR Trade Agreement , a total of 25 Rolls-Royce Nene jet engine s in September 1947 and March 1948. The agreement included an agreement not to use them for military purposes. The price was fixed under a commercial contract; a total of 55 jet engines were sold to the USSR in 1947. However, the Cold War intensified during this period and the Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, reverse-engineered the Nene and installed their own version in the MiG-15 interceptor. This was used to good effect against US-UK forces in the subsequent Korean War , as well as in several later MiG models. Gordon, Yefim. Mikoyan–Gurevich MIG-15: The Soviet Unions Long-Lived Korean War Fighter, Midland Press , .     After Stalin took political control of most of Eastern Europe, and began to subvert other governments in the Balkans, Attlees and Bevins worst fears of Soviet intentions were realised. The Attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful NATO defence alliance to protect Western Europe against any Soviet expansion. In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war Europe, Attlees Cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American Marshall Plan for the economic recovery of Europe. He called it, one of the most bold, enlightened and good-natured acts in the history of nations .     A group of Labour MPs, organised under the banner of Keep Left urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of a third force of European powers to stand between the US and USSR. However, deteriorating relations between Britain and the USSR, as well as Britains economic reliance on America following the Marshall Plan, steered policy towards supporting the US. In January 1947, fear of both Soviet and American nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the Cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of Britains independent nuclear deterrent , an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party. Britains first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after Attlee had left office.     The London dock strike of July 1949, led by Communists, was suppressed when the Attlee government sent in 13,000 Army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike. His response reveals Attlees growing concern that Soviet expansionism, supported by the British Communist Party, was a genuine threat to national security, and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by Moscow. He noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances, but to help communist unions who were on strike in Canada. Attlee agreed with MI5 that he faced a very present menace .   thu with Attlee in 1945       Decolonisation was never a major election issue but Attlee gave the matter a great deal of attention and was the chief leader in planning and achieving the process of decolonisation of the British Empire , starting in Asia. Nicholas Owen, Attlee governments: The end of empire 1945–51 . Contemporary British History 34 : 12–16.     Gandhi & Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age pp 321–25. Attlee and the Labour leadership were sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru . During the Second World War Attlee was in charge of Indian affairs. He set up the Cripps Mission in 1942, which tried and failed to bring the factions together. When the Congress called for passive resistance in the Quit India movement of 1942–1945, it was Attlee who ordered the arrest and internment for the duration of tens of thousands of Congress leaders and crushed the revolt. Bew, Clement Attlee p 433.     Labours election Manifesto in 1945 called for the advancement of India to responsible self-government , but did not mention independence. F.W.S. Craig, ed., British General Election Manifestos: 1918–1966 p 105. In 1942 the British Raj tried to enlist all major political factors parties in support of the war effort. Congress, led by Nehru and Gandhi, demanded immediate independence and full control by Congress of all of India. That demand was rejected by the British, and Congress opposed the war effort with its Quit India campaign . The Raj immediately responded in 1942 by imprisoning the major national, regional and local Congress leaders for the duration. Attlee did not object. Herman, Gandhi & Churchill p 486-95. By contrast, the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah , and also the Sikh community, strongly supported the war effort. They greatly enlarged their membership and won favour from London for their decision. Attlee retained a fondness for Congress and until 1946, accepted their thesis that they were a non-religious party that accepted Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and everyone else. Kenneth Harris, Attlee pp 362–64     thu   The Muslim league insisted that it was the only true representative of all of the Muslims of India, and by 1946 Attlee had come to agree with them.   With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. Viceroy Wavell said he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. No divisions were available; independence was the only option. David Chandler, The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army p. 331 Given the demands of the Muslim league, independence implied a partition that set off heavily Muslim Pakistan from the main portion of India. Harris, Attlee pp 367–69.     The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. Historian Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a national humiliation but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs. Andrew Roberts, Eminent Churchillians p 78. Churchill in 1940–1945 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, with Attlees approval. Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in the India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonisation. Kenneth Harris, Attlee pp 362–387. Attlee found that Churchills viceroy, Field Marshal Wavell , was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions and too neglectful of Indian political alignments. Irial Glynn, ‘An Untouchable in the Presence of Brahmins’ Lord Wavells Disastrous Relationship with Whitehall During His Time as Viceroy to India, 1943–7 . Modern Asian Studies 413 : 639–663. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten , the dashing war hero and a cousin of the King. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus . Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. Yasmin Khan, The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan pp 6, 83–103, 211. Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu activist in January 1948. Gandhi Is Killed By A Hindu; India Shaken, World Mourns; 15 Die In Rioting In Bombay Three Shots Fired     The final result was two nations consisting of a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan . Both joined the Commonwealth.     Attlee also sponsored the peaceful transition to independence in 1948 of Burma and Ceylon .     Diplomacy & Statecraft 213 : 416–433.       The governments policies with regard to the other colonies, particularly those in Africa, focused on keeping them as strategic Cold War assets while modernising their economies. The Labour Party had long attracted aspiring leaders from Africa and had developed elaborate plans before the war. Implementing them overnight with an empty treasury proved too challenging. A major military base was built in Kenya, and the African colonies came under an unprecedented degree of direct control from London. Development schemes were implemented to help solve Britains post-war balance of payments crisis and raise African living standards. This new colonialism worked slowly and had failures such as the Tanganyika groundnut scheme .         The 1950 election gave Labour a massively reduced majority of five seats compared to the triple-digit majority of 1945. Although re-elected, the result was seen by Attlee as very disappointing, and was widely attributed to the effects of post-war austerity denting Labours appeal to middle-class voters. With such a small majority leaving him dependent on a small number of MPs to govern, Attlees second term was much tamer than his first. Some major reforms were nevertheless passed, particularly regarding industry in urban areas and regulations to limit air and water pollution. H. G. Nicholas, The British general election of 1950 .       By 1951, the Attlee government was exhausted, with several of its most senior ministers ailing or ageing, and with a lack of new ideas. Attlees record for settling internal differences in the Labour Party fell in April 1951, when there was a damaging split over an austerity Budget brought in by the Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell , to pay for the cost of Britains participation in the Korean War . Aneurin Bevan resigned to protest against the new charges for teeth and spectacles in the National Health Service introduced by that Budget, and was joined in this action by several senior ministers, including the future Prime Minister Harold Wilson , then the President of the Board of Trade . Thus escalated a battle between the left and right wings of the Party that continues today.     Finding it increasingly impossible to govern, Attlees only chance was to call a snap election in October 1951, in the hope of achieving a more workable majority and to regain authority.

The Fall of the Attlee Government, 1951 . in Timothy Heppell and Kevin Theakston, eds. How Labour Governments Fall . pp 61–82.       Following the defeat in 1951, Attlee continued to lead the party as Leader of the Opposition. His last four years as leader were, however, widely seen as one of the Labour Partys weaker periods. Thorpe, Andrew. A History of the British Labour Party, Palgrave;     The period was dominated by infighting between the Labour Partys right wing, led by Hugh Gaitskell , and its left, led by Aneurin Bevan . Many Labour MPs felt that Attlee should have retired after the 1951 election and allowed a younger man to lead the party. Bevan openly called for him to stand down in the summer of 1954. Williams, Charles. Harold Macmillan , p. 221 One of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of Herbert Morrison , whom Attlee disliked for both political and personal reasons. At one time, Attlee had favoured Aneurin Bevan to succeed him as leader, but this became problematic after Bevan almost irrevocably split the party.     In an interview with the ": null

        " columnist Percy Cudlipp in mid-September 1955, Attlee made clear his own thinking together with his preference for the leadership succession, stating:       Attlee, now aged 72, contested the 1955 general election against Anthony Eden , which saw Labour lose 18 seats, and the Conservatives increase their majority. He retired as Leader of the Labour Party on 7 December 1955, having led the party for twenty years, and on 14 December Hugh Gaitskell was elected as his replacement.       thu of the Earls Attlee   He subsequently retired from the House of Commons and was elevated to the peerage to take his seat in the House of Lords as Earl Attlee and Viscount Prestwood on 16 December 1955. He believed Eden had been forced into taking a strong stand on the Suez Crisis by his backbenchers. Bew, John Citizen Clem: A Biography of Attlee p. 538 In 1958, he was, along with numerous notables, to establish the Homosexual Law Reform Society . The society campaigned for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in private by consenting adults, a reform which was voted through Parliament nine years later.     In 1962, he spoke twice in the House of Lords against the British governments application for the UK to join the European Economic Community . In his second speech delivered in November, Attlee claimed that Britain had a separate parliamentary tradition from the Continental countries that composed the EEC. He also claimed that if Britain was a member, EEC rules would prevent the British government from planning the economy and that Britains traditional policy had been outward looking rather than Continental. in the House of Lords on the British application to join the Common Market .     He attended Winston Churchill s funeral in January 1965. He was elderly and frail by that time, and had to remain seated in the freezing cold as the coffin was carried, having tired himself out by standing at the rehearsal the previous day. He lived to see the Labour Party return to power under Harold Wilson in 1964, but also to see his old constituency of Walthamstow West fall to the Conservatives in a by-election in September 1967 . Beckett 2015, p.467       Attlee died peacefully in his sleep of pneumonia , at the age of 84 at Westminster Hospital on 8 October 1967. Two thousand people attended his funeral in November, including the then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson and the Duke of Kent , representing the Queen . He was cremated and his ashes were buried at Westminster Abbey .     Upon his death, the title passed to his son Martin Richard Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee . It is now held by Clement Attlees grandson John Richard Attlee, 3rd Earl Attlee . The third earl retained his seat in the Lords as one of the hereditary peer s to remain under an amendment to Labours 1999 House of Lords Act . http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2014-014/LLN-2014-014.pdf     Attlees estate was sworn for probate purposes at a value of £7,295, Attlee the rt hon Clement Richard of 1 Kings Bench Walk Temple London EC4 died 8 October 1967 Probate London 4 January £7295 in Probate Index for 1968 at probatesearch.service.gov.uk, accessed 7 August 2016 a relatively modest sum for so prominent a figure, and only a fraction of the £75,394 in his fathers estate when he died in 1908.

Arnstein, Walter L. Britain Yesterday and Today: 1830 to the Present, Chapter 19, p. 363 Attlees modesty and quiet manner hid a great deal that has only come to light with historical reappraisal. Attlee himself is said to have responded to critics with a limerick : There were few who thought him a starter, Many who thought themselves smarter. But he ended PM, CH and OM, an Earl and a Knight of the Garter . Kenneth Harris, Attlee     The journalist and broadcaster Anthony Howard called him the greatest Prime Minister of the 20th century . video on YouTube .     His leadership style of consensual government, acting as a chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. Christopher Soames , the British Ambassador to France during the Conservative government of Edward Heath and cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher , remarked that Mrs Thatcher was not really running a team. Every time you have a Prime Minister who wants to make all the decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. Attlee didnt. Thats why he was so damn good . Hennessy, Peter. The Prime Minister: The Office and its Holders since 1945, Chapter 7, p. 150     Thatcher herself wrote in her 1995 memoirs, which charted her beginnings in Grantham to her victory at the 1979 general election , that she admired Attlee, writing: Of Clement Attlee, however, I was an admirer. He was a serious man and a patriot. Quite contrary to the general tendency of politicians in the 1990s, he was all substance and no show .     Attlees government presided over the successful transition from a wartime economy to peacetime, tackling problems of demobilisation, shortages of foreign currency , and adverse deficits in trade balances and government expenditure . Further domestic policies that he brought about included the creation of the National Health Service and the post-war Welfare State , which became key to the reconstruction of post-war Britain. Attlee and his ministers did much to transform the UK into a more prosperous and egalitarian society during their time in office with reductions in poverty and a rise in the general economic security of the population. Tanner, Duncan; Pat Thane & Nick Tiratsoo. Labours First Century.   thu   In foreign affairs, he did much to assist with the post-war economic recovery of Europe. He proved a loyal ally of the United States at the onset of the Cold War . Due to his style of leadership, it was not he, but Ernest Bevin who masterminded foreign policy. It was Attlees government that decided Britain should have an independent nuclear weapons programme, and work on it began in 1947.     Bevin, Attlees Foreign Secretary, famously stated that Weve got to have it and its got to have a bloody Union Jack on it . The first operational British A Bomb was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office. Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US McMahon Act , which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US–UK collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries. British atomic bomb research was kept secret even from some members of Attlees own cabinet, whose loyalty or discretion seemed uncertain. Peter Hennessy, Cabinets and the Bomb, Oxford University Press, 2007.     Although a socialist , Attlee still believed in the British Empire of his youth. He thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of Canada , Australia , and New Zealand as a model, he continued the transformation of the empire into the modern-day British Commonwealth .     His greatest achievement, surpassing many of these, was perhaps the establishment of a political and economic consensus about the governance of Britain that all three major parties subscribed to for three decades, fixing the arena of political discourse until the late-1970s. Peter Clarke, Attlee: The Making of the Postwar Consensus in Peter Clarke, A Question of Leadership: Gladstone to Thatcher , pp. 193–21 In 2004, he was voted the most successful British Prime Minister of the 20th century by a poll of 139 academics organised by Ipsos MORI .     thu   A blue plaque unveiled in 1979 commemorates Attlee at 17 Monkhams Avenue, in Woodford Green in the London borough of Redbridge .     Attlee was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947 . Attlee was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of Queen Mary College on 15 December 1948. The Times, 16 December 1948, p.  3.       thu   On 30 November 1988, a bronze statue of Clement Attlee was unveiled by Harold Wilson outside Limehouse Library in Attlees former constituency. By then Wilson was the last surviving member of Attlees cabinet, and the unveiling of the statue would be one of the last public appearances by Wilson, who was by that point in the early stages of Alzheimers disease ; he died at the age of 79 in May 1995.     Limehouse Library was closed in 2003, after which the statue was vandalised. The council surrounded it with protective hoarding for four years, before eventually removing it for repair and recasting in 2009. In April 2011 the restored statue was unveiled by Peter Mandelson in its new position less than a mile away at the Queen Mary University of London s Mile End campus.     There is also a statue of Clement Attlee in the Houses of Parliament that was erected, instead of a bust, by parliamentary vote in 1979. The sculptor was Ivor Roberts-Jones .
