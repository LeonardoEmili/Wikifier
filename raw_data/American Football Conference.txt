           The American Football Conference  is one of the two  |conferences|Conference|  of the  |National_Football_League|National_Football_League|  , the highest professional level of American football in the United States. This conference and its counterpart the  |National_Football_Conference|National_Football_Conference|  , currently contain 16 teams organized into 4  |divisions|Division| . Both conferences were created as part of the  |1970_merger|Afl–Nfl_Merger|  with the rival  |American_Football_League|American_Football_League|  , with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total of 16 clubs in each conference. The current AFC champions are the  |New_England_Patriots|New_England_Patriots| , who defeated the  |Kansas_City_Chiefs|Kansas_City_Chiefs|  in the 2018  |AFC_Championship_Game|Afc_Championship_Game|  for their 11th conference championship.       Since 2002, like the NFC, the AFC has 16 teams, organized into 4  |divisions|Division|  each with four teams:  |East|Afc_East| ,  |North|Afc_North| ,  |South|Afc_South|  and  |West|Afc_West| .                           This chart of the  |2018_season_standings|2018_Nfl_Seasonregular_Season_Standings|  displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The  |Patriots_in_2018|2018_New_England_Patriots_Season|  finished in first place in the  |AFC_East|Afc_East| . Thus,  |in_2019|2019_New_England_Patriots_Season| , the Patriots will play two games against each of its division rivals , one game against each team in the  |AFC_North|Afc_North|  and  |NFC_East|Nfc_East|  , and one game each against the first-place finishers in the  |AFC_South|Afc_South|  and  |AFC_West|Afc_West|  .       Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:      Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular teams final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the teams prior-season divisional standing.     At the end of each season, the four division winners and two  |wild_cards|Wild_Card|  in the AFC qualify for the  |playoffs|National_Football_League_Playoffs| . The AFC playoffs culminate in the  |AFC_Championship_Game|Afc_Championship_Game|  with the winner receiving the  |Lamar_Hunt|Lamar_Hunt|  Trophy. The AFC Champion then plays the  |NFC|National_Football_Conference|  Champion in the  |Super_Bowl|Super_Bowl| .          Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL  |merged|Afl–Nfl_Merger|  with the  |American_Football_League|American_Football_League|  in 1970.  The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs  before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFLs launch  joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions  |AFL_East|Afl_East|  and  |AFL_West|Afl_West|  were more or less intact, while the NFLs Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central. Upon the completion of the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970, the newly-minted American Football Conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the  |1970_season|1970_Nfl_Season| ; the National Football Conference, however, could not agree upon their setup, and one was chosen from a fishbowl on January 16, 1970.     Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the  |Seattle_Seahawks|Seattle_Seahawks|  and the  |Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers|Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers|  joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the  |2002_realignment|2002_Nfl_Seasonexpansion_And_Realignment| . The expansion  |Jacksonville_Jaguars|Jacksonville_Jaguars|  joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the  |Baltimore_Colts|History_Of_The_Baltimore_Colts| |_relocated|Baltimore_Colts_Relocation_To_Indianapolis|  to Indianapolis. In 1995, the  |Cleveland_Browns|Cleveland_Browns|  had attempted to move to Baltimore; the resulting  |dispute|Cleveland_Browns_Relocation_Controversy|  between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the  |Baltimore_Ravens|Baltimore_Ravens|  with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL. The Ravens were treated as an expansion team.     In California, the  |Oakland_Raiders|Oakland_Raiders|  relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, and back to Oakland in 1995, while the  |San_Diego_Chargers|History_Of_The_San_Diego_Chargers|  returned to Los Angeles in 2017 after 56 years in San Diego.     The  |Houston_Oilers|History_Of_The_Houston_Oilers|  moved to  |Tennessee|Tennessee|  in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the  |Tennessee_Titans|Tennessee_Titans| .     The NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the  |Houston_Texans|Houston_Texans|  to the AFC. With the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time, the divisional setup has remained static ever since.     Between 1995 and 2018, the AFC has sent less than half of the 16 AFC teams to the  |Super_Bowl|Super_Bowl|  with only 7 of the 16 individual teams making it.  |New_England_Patriots|New_England_Patriots|  ,  |Denver_Broncos|Denver_Broncos|  ,  |Pittsburgh_Steelers|Pittsburgh_Steelers|  ,  |Baltimore_Ravens|Baltimore_Ravens|  ,  |Indianapolis_Colts|Indianapolis_Colts|  ,  |Oakland_Raiders|Oakland_Raiders|  , and  |Tennessee_Titans|Tennessee_Titans|  . By contrast, the  |NFC|National_Football_Conference|  has sent 13 of the 16 NFC teams during that same time frame with only the  |Detroit_Lions|Detroit_Lions| ,  |Minnesota_Vikings|Minnesota_Vikings| , and  |Washington_Redskins|Washington_Redskins|  missing out on an appearance in the  |Super_Bowl|Super_Bowl| . 16 of the last 18 AFC champions have started one of just three quarterbacks -  |Tom_Brady|Tom_Brady| ,  |Peyton_Manning|Peyton_Manning| , and  |Ben_Roethlisberger|Ben_Roethlisberger|  - in the Super Bowl. The AFC has started 5 quarterbacks in the last 18 Super Bowls, while the NFC has started 14.          The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the A and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars , and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.         |NBC|Nfl_On_Nbc|  aired the AFCs Sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season. From 1998 to 2013,  |CBS|Nfl_On_Cbs|  was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the AFC. Since 2014, select AFC games are cross-flexed from CBS to  |Fox|Fox_Nfl| .
