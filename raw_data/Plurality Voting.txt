           Plurality voting is an  |electoral_system|Electoral_System|  in which each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate, and the candidate who polls the most among their counterparts  is elected. In a system based on  |single_member_districts|Single_Member_District| , it may be called  first-past-the-post  , single-choice voting, simple plurality or relative/simple majority. In a system based on multi-member districts, it may be referred to as winner-takes-all or  |bloc_voting|Plurality_At_Large_Voting| . The system is often used to elect members of a legislative assembly or executive officers. It is the most common form of the system, and is used in most elections in the United States, the lower house  in India, elections to the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons|  and English local elections in the United Kingdom.     Plurality voting is distinguished from a majoritarian electoral system, in which, to win, a candidate must receive an  |absolute_majority|Absolute_Majority|  of votes, i.e., more votes than all other candidates combined. Both systems may use  |single_member|Single_Member_District|  or multi-member constituencies. In the latter case it may be referred to as an exhaustive counting system: one member is elected at a time and the process repeated until the number of vacancies is filled.     In some jurisdictions, including France and some of the United States including  |Louisiana|Louisiana|  and  |Georgia|Georgia| , a two-ballot or runoff election plurality system is used. This may require  |two_rounds|Two_Round_System|  of voting. If on the first round no candidate receives over 50% of the votes, then a second round takes place, with just the two highest-voted candidates in the first round. This ensures that the winner gains a majority of votes in the second round. Alternatively, all candidates above a certain threshold in the first round may compete in the second round. If there are more than two candidates standing, then a plurality vote may decide the result.     In  |political_science|Political_Science| , the use of plurality voting with multiple, single-winner constituencies to elect a multi-member body is often referred to as single-member district plurality or SMDP.  This combination is also variously referred to as winner-takes-all to contrast it with  |proportional_representation|Proportional_Representation|  systems. This term is sometimes also used to refer to elections for multiple winners in a particular constituency using bloc voting.       Plurality voting is used for local and/or national elections in 43 of the 193 countries that are members of the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| . Plurality voting is particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom and former British colonies, including the United States, Canada and India.      In single winner plurality voting, each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate, and the winner of the election is whichever candidate represents a plurality of voters, that is, whoever received the largest number of votes. This makes plurality voting among the simplest of all electoral systems for voters and vote counting officials.     In an election for a legislative body, with single-member seats, each voter in a given geographically-defined  |electoral_district|Constituency|  is entitled to vote for one candidate from a list of candidates competing to represent that district. Under the plurality system, the winner of the election then becomes the representative of the entire electoral district, and serves with representatives of other electoral districts.     In an election for a single seat, such as for  |president|President|  in a  |presidential_system|Presidential_System| , the same style of ballot is used and the winner is the candidate who receives the largest number of votes.     In the  |two_round_system|Two_Round_System| , usually the two highest polling candidates in the first ballot progress to the second round  |Run_off|Two_Round_System|  ballot.     In a multiple member plurality election, with n seats available, the winners are the n candidates with the highest numbers of votes. The rules may allow the voter to vote for one candidate, or for up to n candidates, or maybe some other number.          Generally plurality ballots can be categorized into two forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot where the name of a candidate is written in by hand. A more structured ballot will list all the candidates and allow a mark to be made next to the name of a single candidate ; however a structured ballot can also include space for a  |write_in_candidate|Write_In_Candidate| .           The United Kingdom, like the United States and Canada, uses single-member districts as the base for  |national_elections|Uk_General_Election| . Each electoral district chooses one  |member_of_parliament|Member_Of_Parliament| , i.e. the candidate who gets the most votes, whether or not they get 50% or more of the votes cast . In 1992, for example, a  |Liberal_Democrat_in_Scotland|Inverness_Nairn_And_Lochaber_Elections|  won a seat with just 26% of the votes. This system of single-member districts with plurality winners tends to produce two large political parties; in countries with proportional representation there is not such a great incentive to vote for a large party, and that contributes to  |multi_party_systems|Multi_Party_System| .     Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland use the first past the post system for UK general elections, but use versions of proportional representation for elections to their own assemblies and parliaments. All of the UK has used a form of proportional representation for European Parliament elections.     The countries that inherited the British majoritarian system tend toward two large parties: one left, the other right, such as the U.S. Democrats and Republicans. Canada is an exception, with three major political parties consisting of the New Democratic Party which is to the left, the Conservative Party which is to the right and the Liberal Party which is slightly off center to the left. A fourth party that no longer has major party status is the separatist Bloc Québécois party, which is territorial and concentrated in Quebec. New Zealand used the British system, and it too yielded two large parties. It also left many New Zealanders unhappy, because other viewpoints were ignored, so its parliament in 1993 adopted a new electoral law, modelled on  |Germanys_system|Elections_In_Germanyelection_System|  of proportional representation with a partial selection by constituencies. New Zealand soon developed a more complex party system.  |Roskin_Michael|Michael_Roskin| , Countries and Concepts     After the  |2015_Elections_in_the_United_Kingdom|2015_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , there were calls from  |UKIP|Ukip|  to change to proportional representation after receiving 3,881,129 votes but only 1 MP.  The Green Party was similarly under-represented. This contrasted greatly with the SNP in Scotland who only received 1,454,436 votes but won 56 seats, due to more concentrated support.            If each voter in each city naively selects one city on the ballot , then Memphis will be selected, as it has the most votes . Note that this system does not require that the winner have a  |majority|Majority|  but only a plurality. Memphis wins because it has the most votes, even though 58% of the voters in this example preferred Memphis least. This problem does not arise with the  |two_round_system|Two_Round_System| , in which Nashville would have won.                   To a much greater extent than many other electoral methods, plurality electoral systems encourage  |tactical_voting|Tactical_Voting|  techniques, like compromising . Voters are under pressure to vote for one of the two candidates most likely to win even if their true preference is neither, because a vote for any other candidate is unlikely to lead to the preferred candidate being elected, but will instead reduce support for one of the two major candidates who the voter might prefer to the other—the minority party will simply take votes away from one of the major parties, potentially changing the outcome while gaining nothing. Any other party will typically need to build up its votes and credibility over a series of elections before it is seen as electable.     In the  |Tennessee_example|Plurality_Votingexample| , if all the voters for Chattanooga and Knoxville had instead voted for Nashville, then Nashville would have won ; this would only have been the 3rd choice for those voters, but voting for their respective 1st choices actually results in their 4th choice being elected.     The difficulty is sometimes summed up, in an extreme form, as All votes for anyone other than the second place are votes for the winner , because by voting for other candidates, they have denied those votes to the second place candidate who could have won had they received them. It is often claimed by United States  |Democrats|Democratic_Party|  that Democrat  |Al_Gore|Al_Gore|  lost the  |2000_Presidential_Election|2000_U_S_Presidential_Election|  to  |Republican|Republican_Party| |_George_W_Bush|George_W_Bush|  because some voters on the left voted for  |Ralph_Nader|Ralph_Nader|  of the  |Green_Party|Green_Party_Of_The_United_States| , who exit polls indicated would have preferred Gore at 45% to Bush at 27%, with the rest not voting in Naders absence.      This thinking is illustrated by elections in  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico|  and its three principal voter groups: the  |Independentistas|Puerto_Rican_Independence_Party|  , the  |Populares|Popular_Democratic_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  , and the  |Estadistas|New_Progressive_Party_Of_Puerto_Rico|  . Historically, there has been a tendency for Independentista voters to elect Popular candidates and policies. This phenomenon is responsible for some Popular victories, even though the Estadistas have the most voters on the island. It is so widely recognised that the Puerto Ricans sometimes call the Independentistas who vote for the Populares melons , because the fruit is green on the outside but red on the inside.     Because voters have to predict in advance who the top two candidates will be, this can cause significant perturbation to the system:     Substantial power is given to the  |news_media|News_Media| . Some voters will tend to believe the medias assertions as to who the leading contenders are likely to be in the election. Even voters who distrust the media will know that other voters do believe the media, and therefore those candidates who receive the most media attention will nonetheless be the most popular and thus most likely to be in one of the top two.   A newly appointed candidate, who is in fact supported by the majority of voters, may be considered not to be likely to become one of the top two candidates; thus, they will receive a reduced number of votes, which will then give them a reputation as a low poller in future elections, compounding the problem.   The system may promote votes against more so than votes for. In the UK, entire campaigns have been organised with the aim of voting against the  |Conservative_party|Conservative_Party|  by voting either  |Labour|Labour_Party|  or  |Liberal_Democrat|Liberal_Democrats| . For example, in a  |constituency|United_Kingdom_Constituencies|  held by the Conservatives, with the Liberal Democrats as the second-place party and the Labour Party in third, Labour supporters might be urged to vote for the Liberal Democrat candidate than their own candidate on the basis that Labour supporters would prefer an MP from a competing left/liberal party than a Conservative one. Similarly, in Labour/Lib Dem marginals where the Conservatives are third, Conservative voters may be encouraged or tempted to vote Lib Dem to help defeat Labour.   If enough voters use this tactic, the first-past-the-post system becomes, effectively,  |runoff_voting|Two_Round_System| —a completely different system—where the first round is held in the court of public opinion; a good example of this is the  |1997_Winchester_by_election|1997_Winchester_By_Election| .     Proponents of other single-winner electoral systems argue that their proposals would reduce the need for tactical voting and reduce the  |spoiler_effect|Spoiler_Effect| . Examples include the commonly used  |two_round_system|Two_Round_System|  of runoffs and  |instant_runoff_voting|Instant_Runoff_Voting| , along with less tested systems such as  |approval_voting|Approval_Voting| ,  |score_voting|Score_Voting|  and  |Condorcet_methods|Condorcet_Methods| .                |Duvergers_law|Duvergers_Law|  is a theory that constituencies that use first-past-the-post systems will have a  |two_party_system|Two_Party_System| , given enough time.      First-past-the-post tends to reduce the number of political parties to a greater extent than most other methods do, making it more likely that a single party will hold a majority of legislative seats.     FPTPs tendency toward fewer parties and more frequent one-party rules can also produce government that may not consider as wide a range of perspectives and concerns. It is entirely possible that a voter finds all major parties to have similar views on issues and that a voter does not have a meaningful way of expressing a dissenting opinion through their vote.     As fewer choices are offered to voters, voters may vote for a candidate although they disagree with them, because they disagree even more with their opponents. Consequently, candidates will less closely reflect the viewpoints of those who vote for them.     Furthermore, one-party rule is more likely to lead to radical changes in government policy even though the changes are favoured only by a plurality or a bare majority of the voters, whereas a multi-party system usually require greater consensus in order to make dramatic changes in policy.           |Wasted_votes|Wasted_Vote|  are those cast for candidates who are virtually sure to lose in a  |safe_seat|Safe_Seat| , and votes cast for winning candidates in excess of the number required for victory. For example, in the  |UK_General_Election_of_2005|Uk_General_Election_Of_2005| , 52% of votes were cast for losing candidates and 18% were excess votes—a total of 70% wasted votes. This is perhaps the most fundamental criticism of FPTP, that a large majority of votes may play no part in determining the outcome. Alternative electoral systems attempt to ensure that almost all votes are effective in influencing the result, and vote wastage is consequently minimised.       Because FPTP permits a high level of wasted votes, an election under FPTP is easily gerrymandered unless safeguards are in place. In  |gerrymandering|Gerrymandering| , a party in power deliberately manipulates constituency boundaries to unfairly increase the number of seats it wins.     In brief, suppose that governing party G wishes to reduce the seats that will be won by opposition party O in the next election. It creates a number of constituencies in each of which O has an overwhelming majority of votes. O will win these seats, but many of its voters will waste their votes. Then the rest of the constituencies are designed to have small majorities for G. Few G votes are wasted, and G will win many seats by small margins. As a result of the gerrymander, Os seats have cost it more votes than Gs seats.       The presence of  |spoilers|Spoiler|  often gives rise to suspicions that  |manipulation_of_the_slate|Strategic_Nomination|  has taken place. The spoiler may have received incentives to run. A spoiler may also drop out at the last moment, inducing charges that such an act was intended from the beginning.          The spoiler effect is the effect of vote splitting between candidates or ballot questions with similar ideologies. One  spoiler candidate s presence in the election draws votes from a major candidate with similar politics thereby causing a strong opponent of both or several to win. Smaller parties can disproportionately change the outcome of an FPTP election by swinging what is called the 50-50% balance of two party systems, by creating a  |faction|Political_Faction|  within one or both ends of the  |political_spectrum|Political_Spectrum|  which shifts the winner of the election from an  |absolute_majority|Absolute_Majority|  outcome to a  |simple_majority|Plurality|  outcome favouring the previously less favoured party. In comparison, for electoral systems using  |proportional_representation|Proportional_Representation|  small groups win only their proportional share of representation.           In August 2008, Sir  |Peter_Kenilorea|Peter_Kenilorea|  commented on what he perceived as the flaws of a first-past-the-post electoral system in the  |Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands|          The United Kingdom continues to use the first-past-the-post electoral system for general elections, and for local government elections in England and Wales. Changes to the UK system have been proposed, and alternatives were examined by the  |Jenkins_Commission|Jenkins_Commission|  in the late 1990s. After the formation of a new  |coalition_government|Conservative_Liberal_Democrat_Coalition|  in 2010, it was announced as part of the  |coalition_agreement|Conservative_Liberal_Democrat_Coalition_Agreement|  that a  |referendum|2011_United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_Referendum|  would be held on switching to the  |alternative_vote_system|Instant_Runoff_Voting| . However the alternative vote system was rejected 2-1 by British voters in a  |referendum_held_on_5_May_2011|2011_United_Kingdom_Alternative_Vote_Referendum| .     Canada also uses FPTP for national and  |provincial|Provinces_And_Territories_Of_Canada|  elections. In May 2005 the Canadian province of  |British_Columbia|British_Columbia|  had a referendum on abolishing single-member district plurality in favour of multi-member districts with the  |Single_Transferable_Vote|Single_Transferable_Vote|  system after the  |Citizens_Assembly_on_Electoral_Reform|Citizens_Assembly_On_Electoral_Reform|  made a recommendation for the reform. The referendum obtained 57% of the vote, but failed to meet the 60% requirement for passing. An  |October_2007_referendum|2007_Ontario_Electoral_Reform_Referendum|  in the Canadian province of  |Ontario|Ontario|  on adopting a  |Mixed_Member_Proportional|Mixed_Member_Proportional_Representation|  system, also requiring 60% approval, failed with only 36.9% voting in favour.     Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand are notable examples of countries within the UK, or with previous links to it, that use non-FPTP electoral systems .     Nations which have undergone democratic reforms since 1990 but have not adopted the FPTP system include South Africa, almost all of the former Eastern bloc nations, Russia, Afghanistan and Iraq.          Countries that use plurality voting to elect the lower or only house of their legislature include:        |Antigua_and_Barbuda|Antigua_And_Barbuda| |_Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan| |_Bahamas|Bahamas| |_Bangladesh|Bangladesh| |_Barbados|Barbados| |_Belize|Belize| |_Bermuda|Bermuda| |_Bhutan|Bhutan| |_Botswana|Botswana| |_Burma_|Burma| |_Canada|Canada| |_Comoros|Comoros| |_Congo_|Congo| |_Cook_Islands|Cook_Islands| |_Cote_dIvoire|Cote_Divoire| |_Dominica|Dominica| |_Eritrea|Eritrea| |_Ethiopia|Ethiopia| |_Gabon|Gabon| |_Gambia|Gambia| |_Ghana|Ghana| |_Grenada|Grenada| |_India|India| |_Iran|Iran| |_Jamaica|Jamaica| |_Kenya|Kenya| |_Kuwait|Kuwait| |_Laos|Laos| |_Liberia|Liberia| |_Malawi|Malawi| |_Malaysia|Malaysia| |_Maldives|Maldives| |_Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands| |_Micronesia|Micronesia| |_Nigeria|Nigeria| |_Niue|Niue| |_Oman|Oman| |_Palau|Palau| |_Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis|Saint_Kitts_And_Nevis| |_Saint_Lucia|Saint_Lucia| |_Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines|Saint_Vincent_And_The_Grenadines| |_Samoa|Samoa| |_Seychelles|Seychelles| |_Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone| |_Singapore|Singapore| |_Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands| |_Swaziland|Swaziland| |_Tanzania|Tanzania| |_Tonga|Tonga| |_Trinidad_and_Tobago|Trinidad_And_Tobago| |_Tuvalu|Tuvalu| |_Uganda|Uganda| |_United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland|United_Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain_And_Northern_Ireland| |_United_States|United_States| |_Yemen|Yemen| |_Zambia|Zambia|     .
