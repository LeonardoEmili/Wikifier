Gould, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, p. 189 His Anatomie menschlicher Embryonen employs a series of his most important drawings chronicling developing embryos from the end of the second week through the end of the second month of pregnancy. His, in opposition to Haeckel, seeks to take human embryos out of the hands of Darwinist proponents. In 1878, His begins to engage in serious study of the anatomy of human embryos for his drawings. During the 19th century, embryologists often obtained early human embryos from abortions and miscarriages, postmortems of pregnant women and collections in anatomical museums. Hopwood, Producing Development , p. 38 In order to construct his series of drawings, His collected specimens which he manipulated into a form that he could operate with.     In His’ Normentafel, he displays specific individual embryos rather than ideal types. Hopwood, Producing Development , p. 36 His does not produce norms from aborted specimens, but rather visualizes the embryos in order to make them comparable and specifically subjects his embryo specimens to criticism and comparison with other cases. Ultimately, His’ critical work in embryonic development comes with his production of a series of embryo drawings of increasing length and degree of development. Hopwood, Producing Development , p. 50 His’ depiction of embryological development strongly differs from Haeckels depiction, for His argues that the phylogenetic explanation of ontogenetic events is unnecessary. His argues that all ontogenetic events are the “mechanical” result of differential cell growth.

Although Haeckel is proven right about the allantois, the utilization of Krauses embryo as justification turns out to be problematic, for the embryo is that of a bird rather than a human. The underlying debate between Haeckel and His derives from differing viewpoints regarding the similarity or dissimilarity of vertebrate embryos. In response to Haeckels evolutionary claim that all vertebrates are essentially identical in the first month of embryonic life as proof of common descent, His responds by insisting that a more skilled observer would recognize even sooner that early embryos can be distinguished. His also counteracts Haeckels sequence of drawings in the Anthropogenie with what he refers to as “exact” drawings, highlighting specific differences. Ultimately, His goes so far as to accuse Haeckel of “faking” his embryo illustrations to make the vertebrate embryos appear more similar than in reality.

Haeckel’s opponents believe that he de-emphasizes the differences between early embryonic stages in order to make the similarities between embryos of different species more pronounced. Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 282       The first suggestion of fakery against Haeckel was made in late 1868 by Ludwig Rutimeyer in the Archiv für Anthropogenie.

Nevertheless, Bischoffs main argument was in reference to Haeckels drawings of human embryos, for Haeckel is later accused of miscopying the dog embryo from him. Throughout Haeckels time, criticism of his embryo drawings was often due in part to his critics belief in his representations of embryological development as “crude schemata.” Hopwood, Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud , p. 273       Michael Richardson and his colleagues in a July 1997 issue of Anatomy and Embryology, Richardson, M.K., Hanken, J., Gooneratne, M.L., Pieau, C., Raynaud. A., Selwood, L. and Wright, G.M. : There is no highly conserved embryonic stage in the vertebrates: implications for current theories of evolution and development. Anatomy and Embryology 196: 91-106. demonstrated that Haeckel falsified his drawings in order to exaggerate the similarity of the phylotypic stage.   In a March 2000 issue of  Natural History , Stephen Jay Gould argued that Haeckel exaggerated the similarities by idealizations and omissions. As well, Gould argued that Haeckels drawings are simply inaccurate and falsified.    On the other hand, one of those who criticized Haeckels drawings, Michael Richardson, has argued that Haeckels much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution . Richardson and Keuck, Haeckels ABC of evolution and development , Biol. Rev. 77, 495-528   But even Richardson admitted in  Science  Magazine in 1997 that his teams investigation of Haeckels drawings were showing them to be one of the most famous fakes in biology.

Futuyma, Douglas, Evolutionary Biology, p. 652-653       Although Charles Darwin accepted Haeckels support for natural selection, he was tentative in using Haeckels ideas in his writings; with regard to embryology, Darwin relied far more on von Baers work.

Nyhart, Lynn K., Biology Takes Form, p. 150 As Gegenbaur argued, the task of comparative anatomy lies in explaining the form and organization of the animal body in order to provide evidence for the continuity and evolution of a series of organs in the body. Haeckel then provided a means of pursuing this aim with his biogenetic law, in which he proposed to compare an individuals various stages of development with its ancestral line. Although Haeckel stressed comparative embryology and Gegenbaur promoted the comparison of adult structures, both believed that the two methods could work in conjunction to produce the goal of evolutionary morphology.

Di Gregorio, Mario A., From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith, p. 254     Modern acceptance of Haeckels Biogenetic Law, despite current rejection of Haeckelian views, finds support in the certain degree of parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny.
