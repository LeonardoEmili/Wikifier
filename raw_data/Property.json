Western legal theory is based, as mentioned, on the owner of property being a legal person. However, not all property systems are founded on this basis.     In every culture studied ownership and possession are the subject of custom and regulation, and law where the term can meaningfully be applied. Many tribal cultures balance individual ownership with the laws of collective groups: tribes, families, associations and nations. For example, the 1839 Cherokee Constitution frames the issue in these terms:          Communal property systems describe ownership as belonging to the entire social and political unit.

The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive.   —      By the mid 19th century, the industrial revolution had transformed England and the United States, and had begun in France. The established conception of what constitutes property expanded beyond land to encompass scarce goods in general. In France, the revolution of the 1790s had led to large-scale confiscation of land formerly owned by church and king. The restoration of the monarchy led to claims by those dispossessed to have their former lands returned.         Section VIII, ": null

Marx notes that under Feudal Law, peasants were legally as entitled to their land as the aristocracy was to its manors. Marx cites several historical events in which large numbers of the peasantry were removed from their lands, which were then seized by the aristocracy. This seized land was then used for commercial ventures . Marx sees this Primitive Accumulation as integral to the creation of English Capitalism. This event created a large un-landed class which had to work for wages in order to survive.

Proudhons conclusion is that property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition.     His analysis of the product of labor upon natural resources as property is more nuanced. He asserts that land itself cannot be property, yet it should be held by individual possessors as stewards of mankind with the product of labor being the property of the producer. Proudhon reasoned that any wealth gained without labor was stolen from those who labored to create that wealth. Even a voluntary contract to surrender the product of labor to an employer was theft, according to Proudhon, since the controller of natural resources had no moral right to charge others for the use of that which he did not labor to create and therefore did not own.

        " main treatise on property can be found in chapter 8 of his book Economic Harmonies .  In a radical departure from traditional property theory, he defines property not as a physical object, but rather as a relationship between people with respect to an object. Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for I may justly gift or trade this water to another person. In essence, what one owns is not the object but the value of the object. By value, Bastiat apparently means market value; he emphasizes that this is quite different from utility.  In our relations with one another, we are not owners of the utility of things, but of their value, and value is the appraisal made of reciprocal services.      Bastiat theorized that, as a result of technological progress and the division of labor, the stock of communal wealth increases over time; that the hours of work an unskilled laborer expends to buy e.g. 100 liters of wheat decreases over time, thus amounting to gratis satisfaction.  Thus, private property continually destroys itself, becoming transformed into communal wealth. The increasing proportion of communal wealth to private property results in a tendency toward equality of mankind.  Since the human race started from the point of greatest poverty, that is, from the point where there were the most obstacles to be overcome, it is clear that all that has been gained from one era to the next has been due to the spirit of property.      This transformation of private property into the communal domain, Bastiat points out, does not imply that private property will ever totally disappear. This is because man, as he progresses, continually invents new and more sophisticated needs and desires.         ": null

He defined property as a mans life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life.     Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: “Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full control over his own property.” Galambos, Andrew . Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. pp. 868–869. . Galambos defines property as having the following elements:   Primordial property, which is an individuals life   Primary property, which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions   Secondary property, which includes all tangible and intangible possessions which are derivatives of the individuals primary property.     Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individuals life; this means children are not the property of their parents. Galambos, Andrew . Sic Itur Ad Astra.

Galambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property.   For example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individuals money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a persons primordial property.
