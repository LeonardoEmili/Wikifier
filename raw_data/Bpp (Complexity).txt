In  |computational_complexity_theory|Computational_Complexity_Theory| , bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time  is the class of  |decision_problems|Decision_Problem|  solvable by a  |probabilistic_Turing_machine|Probabilistic_Turing_Machine|  in  |polynomial_time|Polynomial_Time|  with an error  |probability|Probability|  bounded away from 1/3 for all instances.   BPP is one of the largest practical classes of problems, meaning most problems of interest in BPP have efficient  |probabilistic_algorithms|Probabilistic_Algorithm|  that can be run quickly on real modern machines. BPP also contains P, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with a deterministic machine, since a deterministic machine is a special case of a probabilistic machine.        sup  /sup sup  sup /sup  /sup  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  sub /sub ref  /ref  sub /sub  sup  /sup  ref  /ref  math /math  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  ref  /ref sup /sup ref  /ref  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup  /sup br/  sup  /sup  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup sup /sup /sup sup sup /sup /sup sup /sup  ref name Babai  /ref math .
