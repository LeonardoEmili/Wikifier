In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, The American Radio Company of the Air, which had essentially the same format as PHC. In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to A Prairie Home Companion; it has remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting ever since.      On a typical broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion, Keillors name is not mentioned unless a guest addresses him by name, although some sketches feature Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler.

In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the citys Queens Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary.  Keillor has produced broadcast performances similar to PHC but without the Prairie Home Companion brand, as in his 2008 appearance at the Oregon Bach Festival.  He was also the host of  The Writers Almanac , from 1993 to 2017, which, like PHC, was produced and distributed by American Public Media.

Pennsylvanian singer-songwriter Tom Flannery wrote a song in 2003 titled I Want a Job Like Garrison Keillors.   Two parody books by Harrison Geillor : The Zombies of Lake Woebegotten and The Twilight of Lake Woebegotten, were published by Night Shade Books in 2010 and 2011.       thu   Keillor is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party . He is tall. He considers himself a loner and prefers not to make eye contact with people. Though not diagnosed, he also considers himself to be on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum . He spoke about his experiences as an autistic person in his keynote address at the 19th Annual Minnesota Autism Conference in 2014.     Keillor has been married three times. He was married to Mary Guntzel from 1965 to 1976; they had one son, Jason . He was married to Ulla Skaerved, a former exchange student from Denmark at Keillors high school whom he re-encountered at a class reunion, from 1985 to 1990. He married classical string player Jenny Lind Nilsson , who is also from Anoka , in 1995. They have one daughter, Maia Grace Keillor .     Between his first and second marriages, Keillor was romantically involved with Margaret Moos, who worked as a producer of A Prairie Home Companion.     On September 7, 2009, Keillor was briefly hospitalized after suffering a minor stroke . He returned to work a few days later.       In 2006, after a visit to a United Methodist church in Highland Park, Texas , Keillor created a local controversy with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes church and that it would be better if I didnt talk about politics. In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two burly security men were a local policeman and the churchs own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillors publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition the coordinator said that Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, so he did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke. Supposedly, before Keillors remarks, participants at the event had considered the visit to have been cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying that he did not have security guards at other stops on the tour.     In 2007, Keillor wrote a column that in part criticized stereotypical gay parents, who he said were sardonic fellows with fussy hair who live in over-decorated apartments with a striped sofa and a small weird dog and who worship campy performers. In response to the strong reactions of many readers, Keillor said:         In 2008, Keillor created a controversy in St. Paul when he filed a lawsuit against his neighbors plan to build an addition on her home, citing his need for light and air and a view of open space and beyond . Keillors home is significantly larger than others in his neighborhood and it would still be significantly larger than his neighbors with its planned addition. Keillor came to an undisclosed settlement with his neighbor shortly after the story became public.     In 2009, one of Keillors Old Scout columns contained a reference to lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys and a complaint about Silent Night as rewritten by Unitarian s, upsetting some readers. A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, Listening to him talk about us over the years, its becoming more and more evident that he isnt laughing with us — hes laughing at us , while Jeff Jacoby of the ": null

In January 2018, Keillor announced he was in mediation with MPR over the firing. On January 23, 2018, MPR News reported further on the investigation after interviewing almost 60 people who had worked with Keillor. The story described other alleged sexual misconduct by Keillor, and a $16,000 severance check for a woman who was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to prevent her from talking about her time at MPR .
