           Shlomo Yitzchaki , today generally known by the acronym Rashi , was a  |medieval_French|France_In_The_Middle_Ages| |rabbi|Rabbi|  and author of a comprehensive commentary on the  |Talmud|Talmud|  and  |commentary_on_the_Tanakh|Jewish_Commentaries_On_The_Bible| . Acclaimed for his ability to present the basic meaning of the text in a concise and lucid fashion, Rashi appeals to both learned scholars and beginner students, and his works remain a centerpiece of contemporary Jewish study. His commentary on the  |Talmud|Talmud| , which covers nearly all of the Babylonian Talmud , has been included in every edition of the Talmud since its first printing by  |Daniel_Bomberg|Daniel_Bomberg|  in the 1520s. His commentary on  |Tanakh|Tanakh| —especially on the  |Chumash|Chumash|  —serves as the basis for more than 300 supercommentaries which analyze Rashis choice of language and citations, penned by some of the greatest names in rabbinic literature.        Rashis surname, Yitzhaki, derives from his fathers name, Yitzhak. The acronym is sometimes also fancifully expanded as Rabban Shel YIsrael which means the rabbi of Israel, or as Rabbenu SheYichyeh . He may be cited in Hebrew and Aramaic texts as Shlomo son of Rabbi Yitzhak , Shlomo son of Yitzhak , Shlomo Yitzhaki , and myriad similar highly respectful derivatives.      In older literature, Rashi is sometimes referred to as Jarchi or Yarhi , his abbreviated name being interpreted as Rabbi Shlomo Yarhi. This was understood to refer to the Hebrew name of  |Lunel|Lunel|  in  |Provence|Provence| , popularly derived from the French lune moon , in Hebrew ,  in which Rashi was assumed to have lived at some time  or to have been born, or where his ancestors were supposed to have originated.   |Simon|Richard_Simon|   and  |Wolf|Johann_Christoph_Wolf|   claimed that only Christian scholars referred to Rashi as Jarchi, and that this epithet was unknown to the Jews.  |Bernardo_de_Rossi|Bernardo_De_Rossi| , however, demonstrated that Hebrew scholars also referred to Rashi as Yarhi.  In 1839,  |Leopold_Zunz|Leopold_Zunz|   showed that the Hebrew usage of Jarchi was an erroneous propagation of the error by Christian writers, instead interpreting the abbreviation as it is understood today: Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki. The evolution of this term has been thoroughly traced.             Rashi was an only child born at  |Troyes|Troyes| ,  |Champagne|Champagne| , in northern France. His mothers brother was  |Simon_the_Elder|Simon_The_Elder| , Rabbi of  |Mainz|Mainz| .   |Shabbat_85b|S:He:שבת_פה_ברש_י| |Gershom_ben_Judah|Gershom_Ben_Judah| , See Rashis comments in  Shabbat  85b. who died that same year. On his fathers side, Rashi has been claimed to be a 33rd-generation descendant of  |Johanan_HaSandlar|Johanan_Hasandlar| , who was a fourth-generation descendant of  |Gamaliel|Gamaliel| , who was reputedly descended from the  |Davidic_line|Davidic_Line| . In his voluminous writings, Rashi himself made no such claim at all. The main early rabbinical source about his ancestry, Responsum No. 29 by  |Solomon_Luria|Solomon_Luria| , makes no such claim either.         His fame later made him the subject of many legends. One tradition contends that his parents were childless for many years. Rashis father, Yitzhak, a poor  |winemaker|Winemaker| , once found a precious jewel and was approached by non-Jews who wished to buy it to adorn their idol. Yitzhak agreed to travel with them to their land, but en route, he cast the gem into the sea. Afterwards he was visited by either the  |Voice_of_God|Voice_Of_God|  or the prophet  |Elijah|Elijah| , who told him that he would be rewarded with the birth of a noble son who would illuminate the world with his Torah knowledge.      Another legend also states that Rashis parents moved to  |Worms,_Germany|Worms,_Germany|  while Rashis mother was pregnant. As she walked down one of the narrow streets in the Jewish quarter, she was imperiled by two oncoming carriages. She turned and pressed herself against a wall, which opened to receive her. This miraculous niche is still visible in the wall of the  |Worms_Synagogue|Worms_Synagogue| . Liber, Maurice. , Kessinger Publishing, 2004. pg. 18–19.           According to tradition, Rashi was first brought to learn Torah by his father on  |Shavuot|Shavuot|  day at the age of five. His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth. At the age of 17 he married and soon after went to learn in the  |yeshiva|Yeshiva|  of Rabbi  |Yaakov_ben_Yakar|Yaakov_Ben_Yakar|  in  |Worms|Worms,_Germany| , returning to his wife three times yearly, for the  |Days_of_Awe|Days_Of_Awe| ,  |Passover|Passover|  and  |Shavuot|Shavuot| . When Rabbi Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Rabbi  |Isaac_ben_Eliezer_Halevi|Isaac_Ben_Eliezer_Halevi| , who was also chief rabbi of Worms. Then he moved to  |Mainz|Mainz| , where he studied under another of his relatives, Rabbi Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the  |Lorraine|Lorraine|  region straddling France and Germany.     Rashis teachers were students of  |Rabbeinu_Gershom|Rabbeinu_Gershom|  and Rabbi  |Eliezer_Hagadol|Eliezer_Hagadol| , leading Talmudists of the previous generation. From his teachers, Rashi imbibed the oral traditions pertaining to the Talmud as they had been passed down for centuries, as well as an understanding of the Talmuds unique logic and form of argument. Rashi took concise, copious notes from what he learned in yeshiva, incorporating this material in his commentaries.       He returned to Troyes at the age of 25, after which time his mother died, and he was asked to join the Troyes  Beth din  . He also began answering  |halakhic|Halakha|  questions. Upon the death of the head of the Bet din, Rabbi  |Zerach_ben_Abraham|Zerach_Ben_Abraham| , Rashi assumed the courts leadership and answered hundreds of halakhic queries.      In around 1070 he founded a yeshiva which attracted many disciples. It is thought by some that Rashi earned his living as a  |vintner|Vintner|  since Rashi shows an extensive knowledge of its utensils and process, but there is no evidence for this.  Most scholars and a Jewish oral tradition contend that he was a vintner. Maurice Liber, Rashi, trans. Adele Szold , p 56; Irving Agus, The Heroic Age of Franco-German Jewry , 173; Israel S. Elfenbein, Rashi in His Responsa , in Rashi, His Teachings and Personality, ed. Simon Federbusch , p 67; Salo W. Baron, Rashi and the Community of Troyes , in Rashi Anniversary Volume, ed. H. L. Ginsberg , p 60. Rashi was a vintner who grew grapes and sold wine. The only reason given for the centuries-old tradition that he was a vintner being not true is that the soil in all of Troyes is not optimal for wine growing grapes, claimed by the research of Rabbi  |Haym_Soloveitchik|Haym_Soloveitchik| . Earlier references such as a reference to an actual seal from his vineyard Oxford Bodleian Ms. Oppenheim 276, p. 35a, cited by  |Avraham_Grossman|Avraham_Grossman| , The Early Sages of France, 132; 135, n. 45. are said not to prove that he sold wine but just that fermented his grapes for his own use.     Although there are many legends about his travels, Rashi likely never went further than from the  |Seine|Seine|  to the  |Rhine|Rhine| ; the utmost limit of his travels were the yeshivas of Lorraine.     In 1096, the  |Peoples_Crusade|Peoples_Crusade|  swept through the Lorraine, murdering 12,000 Jews and uprooting whole communities. Among those murdered in Worms were the three sons of Rabbi Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, Rashis teacher. Rashi wrote several  Selichot  mourning the slaughter and the destruction of the regions great yeshivot. Seven of Rashis Selichot still exist, including Adonai Elohei Hatzvaot , which is recited on the eve of  |Rosh_Hashanah|Rosh_Hashanah| , and Az Terem Nimtehu, which is recited on the  |Fast_of_Gedalia|Fast_Of_Gedalia| .            Rashi died on July 13, 1105  at the age of 65. He was buried in Troyes. The approximate location of the cemetery in which he was buried was recorded in  Seder Hadoros , but over time the location of the cemetery was forgotten. A number of years ago, a  |Sorbonne|University_Of_Paris|  professor discovered an ancient map depicting the site of the cemetery, which now lay under an open square in the city of Troyes. After this discovery, French Jews erected a large monument in the center of the square—a large, black and white globe featuring the three Hebrew letters of רשי artfully arranged counterclockwise in negative space, evoking the style of Hebrew  |microcalligraphy|Micrography| . The granite base of the monument is engraved: Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki — Commentator and Guide.     In 2005,  |Yisroel_Meir_Gabbai|Yisroel_Meir_Gabbai|  erected an additional plaque at this site marking the square as a burial ground. The plaque reads: The place you are standing on is the cemetery of the town of Troyes. Many Rishonim are buried here, among them Rabbi Shlomo, known as Rashi the holy, may his merit protect us .           Rashi had no sons, but his three daughters, Yocheved, Miriam and Rachel, all married Talmudic scholars. Legends exist that Rashis daughters wore  |tefillin|Tefillin| . While some women in medieval Ashkenaz did wear tefillin, there is no evidence that Rashis daughters did or did not do so.  |Avraham_Grossman|Avraham_Grossman| .
