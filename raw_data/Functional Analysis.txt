     Functional analysis is a branch of  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis| , the core of which is formed by the study of  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space|  endowed with some kind of limit-related structure  and the  |linear_functions|Linear_Transformation|  defined on these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense. The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of  |spaces_of_functions|Function_Space|  and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the  |Fourier_transform|Fourier_Transform|  as transformations defining  |continuous|Continuous_Function| ,  |unitary|Unitary_Operator|  etc. operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of  |differential|Differential_Equations|  and  |integral_equations|Integral_Equations| .     The usage of the word  functional  as a noun goes back to the  |calculus_of_variations|Calculus_Of_Variations| , implying a  |function_whose_argument_is_a_function|Higher-Order_Function| . The term was first used in  |Hadamards|Jacques_Hadamard|  1910 book on that subject. However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist  |Vito_Volterra|Vito_Volterra| .  History of the Mathematical Sciences  p. 195 The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, in particular  |Fréchet|Maurice_René_Fréchet|  and  |Lévy|Paul_Lévy| . Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by  |Riesz|Frigyes_Riesz|  and the  |group|Lwów_School_Of_Mathematics|  of  |Polish|Poland|  mathematicians around  |Stefan_Banach|Stefan_Banach| .     In modern introductory texts to functional analysis, the subject is seen as the study of vector spaces endowed with a topology, in particular  |infinite-dimensional_spaces|Dimension| . In contrast,  |linear_algebra|Linear_Algebra|  deals mostly with finite-dimensional spaces, and does not use topology. An important part of functional analysis is the extension of the theory of  |measure|Measure| ,  |integration|Integral| , and  |probability|Probability|  to infinite dimensional spaces, also known as infinite dimensional analysis.       The basic and historically first class of spaces studied in functional analysis are  |complete|Complete_Space| |normed_vector_spaces|Normed_Vector_Space|  over the  |real|Real_Number|  or  |complex_numbers|Complex_Number| . Such spaces are called  |Banach_spaces|Banach_Space| . An important example is a  |Hilbert_space|Hilbert_Space| , where the norm arises from an inner product. These spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the  |mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics|Mathematical_Formulation_Of_Quantum_Mechanics| .     More generally, functional analysis includes the study of  |Fréchet_spaces|Fréchet_Space|  and other  |topological_vector_spaces|Topological_Vector_Space|  not endowed with a norm.     An important object of study in functional analysis are the  |continuous|Continuous_Function| |linear_operators|Linear_Transformation|  defined on Banach and Hilbert spaces. These lead naturally to the definition of  |C-algebras|C-Algebra|  and other  |operator_algebras|Operator_Algebra| .        |Hilbert_spaces|Hilbert_Space|  can be completely classified: there is a unique Hilbert space  |up_to|Up_To| |isomorphism|Isomorphism|  for every  |cardinality|Cardinal_Number|  of the  |orthonormal_basis|Orthonormal_Basis| .  Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are fully understood in  |linear_algebra|Linear_Algebra| , and infinite-dimensional  |separable|Separable_Space|  Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to     . Separability being important for applications, functional analysis of Hilbert spaces consequently mostly deals with this space. One of the open problems in functional analysis is to prove that every bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space has a proper  |invariant_subspace|Invariant_Subspace| . Many special cases of this  |invariant_subspace_problem|Invariant_Subspace_Problem|  have already been proven.       General  |Banach_spaces|Banach_Space|  are more complicated than Hilbert spaces, and cannot be classified in such a simple manner as those. In particular, many Banach spaces lack a notion analogous to an  |orthonormal_basis|Orthonormal_Basis| .     Examples of Banach spaces are  |L_-spaces|Lp_Space|  for any real number p  . Given also a measure   on set X , then L , sometimes also denoted L or L , has as its vectors equivalence classes of  |measurable_functions|Lebesgue-Measurable_Function|  whose  |absolute_values|Absolute_Value|  p -th power has finite integral, that is, functions f  for which one has   :   .
