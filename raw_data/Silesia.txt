           Silesia  is a  |historical_region|Historical_Region|  of  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe|  located mostly in  |Poland|Poland| , with small parts in the  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic|  and Germany. Its area is about , and its population about 8,000,000. Silesia is located along the  |Oder|Oder|  River. It consists of  |Lower_Silesia|Lower_Silesia|  and  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia| .     The region is rich in mineral and natural resources, and includes several important industrial areas. Silesias largest city and historical capital is  |Wrocław|Wrocław| . The biggest metropolitan area is the  |Upper_Silesian_metropolitan_area|Upper_Silesian_Metropolitan_Area| , the centre of which is  |Katowice|Katowice| . Parts of the  |Czech|Czech_Republic|  city of  |Ostrava|Ostrava|  fall within the borders of Silesia.     Silesias borders and national affiliation have changed over time, both when it was a hereditary possession of  |noble_houses|Feudalism|  and after the rise of modern  |nation_states|Nation_States| . The first known states to hold power there were probably those of  |Greater_Moravia|Greater_Moravia|  at the end of the 9th century and  |Bohemia|Duchy_Of_Bohemia|  early in the 10th century. In the 10th century, Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state, and after its division in the 12th century became a  |Piast|Piast| |_duchy|Duchies_Of_Silesia| . In the 14th century, it became a constituent part of the  |Bohemian_Crown_Lands|Lands_Of_The_Bohemian_Crown|  under the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , which passed to the Austrian  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy|  in 1526.     Most of Silesia was conquered by  |Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  in 1742 and transferred from Austria to Prussia in the  |Treaty_of_Berlin|Treaty_Of_Berlin| . Later, Silesia became, as a province of Prussia, a part of the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  and the subsequent  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic| . The varied history with changing aristocratic possessions resulted in an abundance of  |castles|List_Of_Castles_In_Poland|  in Silesia, especially in the  |Jelenia_Góra_valley|List_Of_Castles_And_Palaces_In_Jelenia_Góra_Valley| . After  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the easternmost part of this region, i.e. an eastern strip of Upper Silesia, was awarded to Poland by the  |Entente_Powers|Triple_Entente|  after insurrections by Poles and the  |Upper_Silesian_plebiscite|Upper_Silesian_Plebiscite| . The  |remaining_former_Austrian_parts_of_Silesia|Austrian_Silesia|  were partitioned to  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , forming part of Czechoslovakias  |Sudetenland|Sudetenland|  region, and are today part of the Czech Republic. In 1945, after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , the bulk of Silesia was transferred, on demands of the Polish delegation, to Polish jurisdiction by the  |Potsdam_Agreement|Potsdam_Agreement|  of the victorious  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  and became part of Poland whose  |Communist_government|Polish_Peoples_Republic| |_expelled|Ethnic_Cleansing|  the majority of Silesias  |previous_population|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans_From_Poland_During_And_After_World_War_Ii| . The small  |Lusatia|Lusatia| n strip west of the  |Oder–Neisse_line|Oder–Neisse_Line| , which had belonged to Silesia since 1815, remained in  |Germany|Germany| . The largest town and cultural centre of this region is  |Görlitz|Görlitz| .     As the result of the forced population shifts of 1945-48, todays inhabitants of Silesia speak the national languages of their respective countries. Previously German-speaking  |Lower_Silesia|Lower_Silesia|  has developed a new mixed Polish dialect. An ongoing debate exists whether  |Silesian|Silesian_Language|  speech should be considered a dialect of  |Polish|Polish_Language|  or a separate language. A  |Lower_Silesian_German_dialect|Lower_Silesian_Language|  remains, although today it is almost extinct due to their speakers expulsion.       The names of Silesia in different languages most likely share their etymology— |Latin|Latin| ,  |Spanish|Spanish_Language|  and  |English|English_Language| Silesia; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; . The names all relate to the name of a river  and mountain  in mid-southern Silesia. The mountain served as a cultic place.     Ślęża is listed as one of the numerous  |Pre_Indo_European|Pre_Indo_European_Languages|  topographic names in the region .   Zbigniew Babik, Najstarsza warstwa nazewnicza na ziemiach polskich w granicach średniowiecznej Słowiańszczyzny , Uniwersitas, Kraków, 2001.     According to some Polish  |Slavists|Slavist| , the name Ślęża  or Ślęż  is directly related to the Old Slavic words ślęg  or śląg , which means dampness, moisture, or humidity. Rudolf Fischer. Onomastica slavogermanica. Uniwersytet Wrocławski. 2007. t. XXVI. 2007. str. 83 They disagree with the hypothesis of an origin for the name Śląsk  from the name of the  |Silings|Silingi|  tribe, an etymology preferred by some German authors.                        In the fourth century BC from the south, through the  |Kłodzko_Valley|Kłodzko_Valley| , the  |Celts|Celts|  entered Silesia, and settled around  |Mount_Ślęża|Mount_Ślęża|  near modern  |Wrocław|Wrocław| ,  |Oława|Oława|  and  |Strzelin|Strzelin| . R. Żerelik M. Czpliński Historia Śląska, Wrocław 2007, s. 34–35      |Germanic|Germanic_Peoples| |_Lugii_tribes|Lugii|  were first recorded within Silesia in the 1st century.  |Slavic_peoples|Slavic_Peoples|  arrived in the region around the 7th century, R. Żerelik M. Czpliński Historia Śląska, Wrocław 2007, s. 37–38 and by the early ninth century, their settlements had stabilized. Local Slavs started to erect boundary structures like the  |Silesian_Przesieka|Silesian_Przesieka|  and the  |Silesia_Walls|Silesia_Walls| . The eastern border of  |Silesian|Silesian_Tribes|  settlement was situated to the west of the  |Bytom|Bytom| , and east from  |Racibórz|Racibórz|  and  |Cieszyn|Cieszyn| . East of this line dwelt a closely related Slav tribe, the  |Vistulans|Vistulans| . Their northern border was in the valley of the  |Barycz|Barycz|  River, north of which lived the  |Polans|Polans| . R. Żerelik M. Czpliński Historia Śląska, Wrocław 2007, s. 21–22     The first known states in Silesia were  |Greater_Moravia|Greater_Moravia|  and  |Bohemia|Bohemia| . In the 10th century, the Polish ruler  |Mieszko_I|Mieszko_I|  of the  |Piast_dynasty|Piast_Dynasty|  incorporated Silesia into the Polish state. During the  |Fragmentation_of_Poland|History_Of_Poland_During_The_Piast_Dynasty| , Silesia and the rest of the country were divided among  |many_independent_duchies|Duchies_Of_Silesia|  ruled by various Silesian  |dukes|Dukes_Of_Silesia| . During this time, German cultural and ethnic  |influence|Germanization|  increased as a result of  |immigration|Ostsiedlung|  from German-speaking parts of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| . In 1178, parts of the  |Duchy_of_Kraków|Duchy_Of_Kraków|  around Bytom,  |Oświęcim|Oświęcim| ,  |Chrzanów|Chrzanów| , and  |Siewierz|Siewierz|  were transferred to the Silesian Piasts, although their population was primarily Vistulan and not of Silesian descent.     Between 1289 and 1292, Bohemian king  |Wenceslaus_II|Wenceslaus_Ii|  became  suzerain  of some of the  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia| n duchies. Polish kings had not renounced their hereditary rights to Silesia until 1335. R. Żerelik M. Czpliński Historia Śląska, Wrocław 2007, s. 81 The province became part of the  |Bohemian_Crown|Lands_Of_The_Bohemian_Crown|  under the Holy Roman Empire, and passed with that crown to the  |Habsburg_Monarchy|Habsburg_Monarchy|  of Austria in 1526.     In the 15th century, several changes were made to Silesias borders. Parts of the territories which had been transferred to the Silesian Piasts in 1178 were bought by the  |Polish_kings|Monarchs_Of_Poland|  in the second half of the 15th century . The Bytom area remained in the possession of the Silesian Piasts, though it was a part of the  |Diocese_of_Kraków|Diocese_Of_Kraków| . The Duchy of  |Crossen|Krosno_Odrzańskie|  was inherited by the  |Margraviate_of_Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg|  in 1476, and with the renunciation of King  |Ferdinand_I|Ferdinand_I_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and the estates of Bohemia in 1538, became an integral part of Brandenburg.     In 1742, most of Silesia was seized by King  |Frederick_the_Great|Frederick_Ii_Of_Prussia|  of  |Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  in the  |War_of_the_Austrian_Succession|War_Of_The_Austrian_Succession| , eventually becoming the Prussian  |Province_of_Silesia|Province_Of_Silesia|  in 1815; consequently, Silesia became part of the  |German_Empire|German_Empire|  when it was proclaimed in 1871.     After World War I, a part of Silesia,  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia| , was contested by Germany and the newly independent  |Second_Polish_Republic|Second_Polish_Republic| . The  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  organized a  |plebiscite|Upper_Silesia_Plebiscite|  to decide the issue in 1921. It resulted in 60% of votes being cast for Germany and 40% for Poland. Following the third  |Silesian_Uprising|Silesian_Uprising|  , however, the easternmost portion of Upper Silesia , with a majority ethnic Polish population, was awarded to Poland, becoming the  |Silesian_Voivodeship|Silesian_Voivodeship| . The Prussian Province of Silesia within Germany was then divided into the provinces of  |Lower_Silesia|Province_Of_Lower_Silesia|  and  |Upper_Silesia|Province_Of_Upper_Silesia| . Meanwhile,  |Austrian_Silesia|Austrian_Silesia| , the small portion of Silesia retained by Austria after the  |Silesian_Wars|Silesian_Wars| , was mostly awarded to the new Czechoslovakia , although most of  |Cieszyn|Cieszyn|  and territory to the east of it went to Poland as  |Zaolzie|Zaolzie| .     Polish Silesia was among the first regions invaded during Germanys 1939 attack on Poland. One of the claimed goals of  |Nazi|Nazi|  occupation, particularly in Upper Silesia, was the extermination of those whom Nazis viewed as subhuman, namely Jews and ethnic Poles. The Polish and Jewish population of the then Polish part of Silesia was subjected to genocide involving ethnic cleansing and mass murder, while German colonists were settled in pursuit of Lebensraum. Piotr Eberhardt, Political Migrations in Poland, 1939–1948, Warsaw 2006, p.25 Two thousand Polish intellectuals, politicians, and businessmen were murdered in the Intelligenzaktion Schlesien Maria Wardzyńska Był rok 1939 Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpieczeństwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion IPN Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, 2009 in 1940 as part of a  |Poland_wide_Germanization_program|Intelligenzaktion| . Silesia also housed one of the two main wartime centers where medical experiments were conducted on kidnapped Polish children by Nazis. Kamila Uzarczyk: Podstawy ideologiczne higieny ras. Toruń: Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek, 2002, s. 285, 286, 289. .     The  |Potsdam_Conference|Potsdam_Conference|  of 1945 defined the  |Oder_Neisse_line|Oder_Neisse_Line|  as the border between Germany and Poland, pending a final peace conference with Germany which eventually never took place. ; ;  Millions of Germans in Silesia either fled or were expelled, and new Polish population from Central Poland, or themselves forcibly re-settled from the Soviet Union. After 1945 and in 1946, nearly all of the 4.5 million Silesians of German descent fled, or were interned in camps and  |forcibly_expelled|Ethnic_Cleansing| , including some thousand German Jews who survived the Holocaust and had returned to Silesia; 634,106 Silesians died in the expulsion, nearly 14% of the population. The newly formed  |Polish_United_Workers_Party|Polish_United_Workers_Party|  created a  |Ministry_of_the_Recovered_Territories|Ministry_Of_The_Recovered_Territories|  that claimed half of the available arable land for state-run collectivized farms. Many of the new Polish Silesians who resented the Germans for their invasion in 1939 and brutality in occupation now resented the newly formed Polish communist government for their population shifting and interference in agricultural and industrial affairs.      The administrative division of Silesia within Poland has changed several times since 1945. Since 1999, it has been divided between  |Lubusz_Voivodeship|Lubusz_Voivodeship| ,  |Lower_Silesian_Voivodeship|Lower_Silesian_Voivodeship| ,  |Opole_Voivodeship|Opole_Voivodeship| , and  |Silesian_Voivodeship|Silesian_Voivodeship| . Czech Silesia is now part of the Czech Republic, forming the  |Moravian_Silesian_Region|Moravian_Silesian_Region|  and the northern part of the  |Olomouc_Region|Olomouc_Region| . Germany retains the Silesia-Lusatia region  west of the  |Neisse|Lusatian_Neisse| , which is part of the federal state of  |Saxony|Saxony| .          Most of Silesia is relatively flat, although its southern border is generally mountainous. It is primarily located in a swath running along both banks of the upper and middle  |Oder_|Oder_River|  River, but it extends eastwards to the upper  |Vistula|Vistula|  River. The region also includes many tributaries of the Oder, including the  |Bóbr|Bóbr|  , the  |Barycz|Barycz|  and the  |Nysa_Kłodzka|Nysa_Kłodzka| . The  |Sudeten_Mountains|Sudeten_Mountains|  run along most of the southern edge of the region, though at its south-eastern extreme it reaches the  |Silesian_Beskids|Silesian_Beskids|  and  |Moravian_Silesian_Beskids|Moravian_Silesian_Beskids| , which belong to the  |Carpathian_Mountains|Carpathian_Mountains|  range.     Historically, Silesia was bounded to the west by the  |Kwisa|Kwisa|  and  |Bóbr|Bóbr|  Rivers, while the territory west of the Kwisa was in Upper  |Lusatia|Lusatia|  . However, because part of Upper Lusatia was included in the  |Province_of_Silesia|Province_Of_Silesia|  in 1815, in Germany  |Görlitz|Görlitz| ,  |Niederschlesischer_Oberlausitzkreis|Niederschlesischer_Oberlausitzkreis|  and neighbouring areas are considered parts of historical Silesia. Those districts, along with Polands Lower Silesian Voivodeship and parts of Lubusz Voivodeship, make up the geographic region of Lower Silesia.     Silesia has undergone a similar notional extension at its eastern extreme. Historically, it extended only as far as the  |Brynica|Brynica|  River, which separates it from  |Zagłębie_Dąbrowskie|Zagłębie_Dąbrowskie|  in the  |Lesser_Poland|Lesser_Poland|  region. However, to many Poles today, Silesia  is understood to cover all of the area around Katowice, including Zagłębie. This interpretation is given official sanction in the use of the name Silesian Voivodeship  for the province covering this area. In fact, the word Śląsk in Polish now commonly refers exclusively to this area .     As well as the Katowice area, historical Upper Silesia also includes the  |Opole|Opole|  region and Czech Silesia. Czech Silesia consists of a part of the  |Moravian_Silesian_Region|Moravian_Silesian_Region|  and the  |Jeseník_District|Jeseník_District|  in the  |Olomouc_Region|Olomouc_Region| .       Silesia is a resource-rich and populous region.     Since the middle of the 18th century, coal has been mined. The industry had grown while Silesia was part of Germany, and peaked in the 1970s under the  |Peoples_Republic_of_Poland|History_Of_Poland| . During this period, Silesia became one of the worlds largest producers of coal, with a record tonnage in 1979.  Coal mining declined during the next two decades, but has increased again following the end of Communist rule.      The 41 coal mines in Silesia are mostly part of the  |Upper_Silesian_Coal_Basin|Upper_Silesian_Coal_Basin| , which lies in the Silesian Upland. The coalfield has an area of about 4,500  km 2 . Deposits in Lower Silesia have proven to be difficult to exploit and the areas unprofitable mines were closed in 2000. In 2008, an estimated 35 billion tonnes of  |lignite|Lignite|  reserves were found near Legnica, making them some of the largest in the world.      From the fourth century BC, iron ore has been mined in the upland areas of Silesia. The same period had lead, copper, silver, and gold mining. Zinc, cadmium, arsenic, S.Z. Mikulski, Late-Hercynian gold-bearing arsenic-polymetallic mineralization within Saxothuringian zone in the Polish Sudetes, Northeast Bohemian Massif . In: Mineral Deposit at the Beginning of the 21st Century , A. Piestrzyński et al. . Swets & Zeitinger Publishers  and  |uranium|Uranium|   have also been mined in the region. Lower Silesia features large copper mining and processing between the cities of  |Legnica|Legnica| ,  |Głogów|Głogów| , Lubin, and Polkowice.     The region is known for stone quarrying to produce limestone,  |marl|Marl| , marble, and basalt.          The region also has a thriving  |agricultural|Agriculture|  sector, which produces cereals , potatoes, rapeseed, sugar beets and others. Milk production is well developed. The Opole Silesia has for decades occupied the top spot in Poland for their indices of effectiveness of agricultural land use.      Mountainous parts of southern Silesia feature many significant and attractive tourism destinations . Silesia is generally well forested. This is because greenness is generally highly desirable by the local population, particularly in the highly industrialized parts of Silesia.       Silesia has been historically diverse in every aspect. Nowadays, the largest part of Silesia is located in Poland; it is often cited as one of the most diverse regions in that country.     United States Immigration Commission in its Dictionary of races or peoples considered Silesian as a geographical term, denoting the inhabitants of Silesia. It is also mentioned the existence of both Polish Silesian and German Silesian dialects in that region.            Modern Silesia is inhabited by  |Poles|Poles| ,  |Silesians|Silesians| ,  |Germans|Ethnic_Germans| , and  |Czechs|Czechs| . Germans first came to Silesia during the  |Late_Medieval|Late_Middle_Ages| |_Ostsiedlung|Ostsiedlung| .  The last Polish census of 2002 showed that the Silesians are the largest national minority in Poland, Germans being the second; both groups are located mostly in Upper Silesia. The Czech part of Silesia is inhabited by Czechs,  |Moravians|Moravians| , Silesians, and Poles.     Before the Second World War, Silesia was inhabited mostly by Germans, with and Poles a large minority forming a close majority in  |Upper_Silesia|Upper_Silesia| .  Silesia was also home of a Czech and a Jewish minority. The German population tended to be based in the urban centres and in the rural areas to the north and west, whilst the Polish population was generally rural and could be found in the east and in the south. Hunt Tooley, T . National Identity and Weimar Germany: Upper Silesia and the Eastern Border, 1918–1922, University of Nebraska Press, p.17.  |Lower_Silesia|Lower_Silesia|  did not have any significant Polish minority.             Historically, Silesia was about equally split between  |Protestants|Protestants|   and  |Roman_Catholics|Roman_Catholics| . In an 1890 census taken in the German part, Roman Catholics made up a slight majority of 53%, while the remaining 47% were almost entirely Lutheran. Meyers Konversationslexikon 5. Auflage Geographically speaking, Lower Silesia was mostly Lutheran except for the  |Glatzer_Land|Kłodzko_Land|  . Upper Silesia was mostly Roman Catholic except for some of its northwestern parts, which were predominantly Lutheran. Generally speaking, the population was mostly Protestant in the western parts, and it tended to be more Roman Catholic the further east one went. In Upper Silesia, Protestants were concentrated in larger cities and often identified as German. After World War II, the religious demographics changed drastically as Germans, who constituted the bulk of the Protestant population,  |fled_or_were_forcibly_expelled|Flight_And_Expulsion_Of_Germans| . Poles, who were mostly Roman Catholic, were resettled in their place. Today, Silesia remains predominantly Roman Catholic.

The majority of Germans fled or were expelled from the present-day Polish and Czech parts of Silesia during and after World War II. From June 1945 to January 1947, 1.77 million Germans were expelled from Lower Silesia, and 310,000 from Upper Silesia. DB Klusmeyer & DG Papademetriou . Immigration policy in the Federal Republic of Germany: negotiating membership and remaking the nation, Berghahn, p.70. Today, most German Silesians and their descendants live in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, many of them in the  |Ruhr_area|Ruhr_Area|  working as miners, like their ancestors in Silesia. To smooth their integration into West German society after 1945, they were placed into officially recognized organizations, like the  |Landsmannschaft_Schlesien|Landsmannschaft_Schlesien| , with financing from the federal West German budget. One of its most notable but controversial spokesmen was the  |Christian_Democratic_Union|Christian_Democratic_Union|  politician  |Herbert_Hupka|Herbert_Hupka| .     The expulsion of Germans led to widespread underpopulation. The population of the town of  |Glogau|Glogau|  fell from 33,500 to 5,000, and from 1939 to 1966 the population of Wrocław fell by 25%.
