            Californium is a  |radioactive|Radioactive_Decay| |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Cf and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the  |Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory|Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory|  , by bombarding  |curium|Curium|  with  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  . It is an  |actinide|Actinide|  element, the sixth  |transuranium_element|Transuranium_Element|  to be  |synthesized|Synthetic_Element| , and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the  |unaided_eye|Naked_Eye|  . The element was named after the university and the state of  |California|California| .     Two  |crystalline_forms|Crystalline_Form|  exist for californium under normal pressure: one above and one below . A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature.  |Compounds_of_californium|Compounds_Of_Californium|  are dominated by the +3  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State| . The most stable of californiums twenty known  |isotopes|Isotope|  is californium-251, which has a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 898  years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earths crust. Californium-252, with a half-life of about 2.645  years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the  |Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|  in the United States and the  |Research_Institute_of_Atomic_Reactors|Research_Institute_Of_Atomic_Reactors|  in Russia.     Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain  |isotopes_of_californium|Isotopes_Of_Californium|  to emit  |neutrons|Neutron| . For example, californium can be used to help start up  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor| , and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using  |neutron_diffraction|Neutron_Diffraction|  and  |neutron_spectroscopy|Neutron_Spectroscopy| . Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements;  |oganesson|Oganesson|  was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with  |calcium-48|Calcium-48|  ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the elements ability to disrupt the formation of  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cell|  by  |bioaccumulating|Bioaccumulating|  in skeletal tissue.           Californium is a silvery white  |actinide|Actinide|  metal with a  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  of  and an estimated  |boiling_point|Boiling_Point|  of . The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade. Californium metal starts to vaporize above  when exposed to a vacuum. Below  californium metal is either  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetism|  or  |ferrimagnetic|Ferrimagnetism|  , between 48 and 66  K it is  |antiferromagnetic|Antiferromagnetic|  , and above  it is  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism|  . It forms  |alloys|Alloy|  with  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  metals but little is known about them.     The element has two  |crystalline_forms|Crystal_Structure|  under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure: a double- |hexagonal_close-packed|Close-Packing_Of_Spheres|  form dubbed alpha and a  |face-centered_cubic|Cubic_Crystal_System|  form designated beta . The α form exists below 600–800  °C with a density of 15.10  g/cm 3 and the β form exists above 600–800  °C with a density of 8.74  g/cm 3 . At 48   |GPa|Pascal|  of pressure the β form changes into an  |orthorhombic_crystal_system|Orthorhombic_Crystal_System|  due to delocalization of the atoms  |5f_electrons|Electron_Shell| , which frees them to bond.     The  |bulk_modulus|Bulk_Modulus|  of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californiums bulk modulus is , which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium .             Californium exhibits oxidation states of 4, 3, or 2. It typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions. Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3+ valence actinide elements and the element  |dysprosium|Dysprosium| , which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table. The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing when moisture is added. Californium reacts when heated with  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| ,  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| , or a  |chalcogen|Chalcogen|  ; reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous  |mineral_acids|Mineral_Acid|  are rapid.      Californium is only  |water-soluble|Aqueous_Solution|  as the californium  |cation|Cation| . Attempts to  |reduce_or_oxidize|Redox|  the +3 ion in solution have failed. The element forms a water-soluble  |chloride|Chloride| ,  |nitrate|Nitrate| ,  |perchlorate|Perchlorate| , and  |sulfate|Sulfate|  and is precipitated as a  |fluoride|Fluoride| ,  |oxalate|Oxalate| , or  |hydroxide|Hydroxide| . Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties, as is observed in the californium borate.           Twenty  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  of californium have been characterized, the most stable being californium-251 with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years, and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than a year, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of californium range in  |mass_number|Mass_Number|  from 237 to 256.     Californium-249 is formed from the  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  of berkelium-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a  |nuclear_reactor|Nuclear_Reactor| . Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons  and its tendency to interact with other particles .     Californium-252 is a very strong  |neutron|Neutron|  emitter, which makes it extremely  |radioactive|Radioactive|  and harmful.    Californium-252 undergoes  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay|  96.9% of the time to form  |curium|Curium| -248 while the remaining 3.1% of decays are  |spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission| . One  |microgram|Microgram|  of californium-252 emits 2.3  million neutrons per second, an average of 3.7 neutrons per spontaneous fission.  Most of the other isotopes of californium decay to isotopes of curium  via alpha decay.          Californium was  |first_synthesized|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  at the  |University_of_California|University_Of_California,_Berkeley| |Radiation_Laboratory|Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory|  in  |Berkeley|Berkeley,_California| , by the physics researchers  |Stanley_G._Thompson|Stanley_Gerald_Thompson| ,  |Kenneth_Street,_Jr.|Kenneth_Street,_Jr.| ,  |Albert_Ghiorso|Albert_Ghiorso| , and  |Glenn_T._Seaborg|Glenn_T._Seaborg|  on or about February 9, 1950. It was the sixth  |transuranium_element|Transuranium_Element|  to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.        To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of curium-242  was bombarded with 35  MeV- |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|   in the   |cyclotron|Cyclotron|  at Berkeley, which produced californium-245  plus one  |free_neutron|Free_Neutron|  .     : +  →  +    Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment, and these atoms had a half-life of 44  minutes.     The discoverers named the new element after the university and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named. However, the element directly above element  98 in the periodic table,  |dysprosium|Dysprosium| , has a name that simply means hard to get at so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention. They added that the best we can do is to point out ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California.      Weighable quantities of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at the  |Materials_Testing_Reactor|Materials_Testing_Reactor|  at the  |National_Reactor_Testing_Station|Idaho_National_Laboratory|  in  |eastern_Idaho|Eastern_Idaho| ; and these findings were reported in 1954.  The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples. The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958. The isotopes californium-249 to californium-252 were isolated that same year from a sample of  |plutonium-239|Plutonium-239|  that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years. Two years later, in 1960,  |Burris_Cunningham|Burris_Cunningham|  and  |James_Wallman|James_Wallman|  of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds—californium trichloride,  |californium_oxychloride|Californium_Oxychloride| , and californium oxide—by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.      The  |High_Flux_Isotope_Reactor|High_Flux_Isotope_Reactor|  at the  |Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|  in  |Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee|Oak_Ridge,_Tennessee| , started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s.  By 1995, the HFIR nominally produced  of californium annually. Plutonium supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States under the  |1958_US-UK_Mutual_Defence_Agreement|1958_Us-Uk_Mutual_Defence_Agreement|  was used for californium production.      The  |Atomic_Energy_Commission|U.S._Atomic_Energy_Commission|  sold californium-252 to industrial and academic customers in the early 1970s for $10 per microgram and an average of  of californium-252 were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990. Californium metal was first prepared in 1974 by Haire and Baybarz who reduced californium oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub-micrometer thick films.         Traces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments. The element is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations of it in the soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.       |Fallout|Fallout|  from atmospheric  |nuclear_testing|Nuclear_Testing|  prior to 1980 contributed a small amount of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with  |mass_numbers|Mass_Number|  249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion.  Californium is not a major radionuclide at  |United_States_Department_of_Energy|United_States_Department_Of_Energy|  legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.     Californium was once believed to be produced in  |supernovas|Supernova| , as their decay matches the 60-day half-life of 254 Cf.  However, subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra,  and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of  |nickel-56|Isotopes_Of_Nickel| .     The  |transuranic_elements|Transuranic_Element|  from  |americium|Americium|  to  |fermium|Fermium| , including californium, occurred naturally in the  |natural_nuclear_fission_reactor|Natural_Nuclear_Fission_Reactor|  at  |Oklo|Oklo| , but no longer do so.           Californium is produced in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor|  and  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator| . Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249  with neutrons, forming berkelium-250  via  |neutron_capture|Neutron_Capture|  which, in turn, quickly  |beta_decays|Beta_Decay|  to californium-250  in the following reaction:   : →  + β −   Bombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.     Prolonged irradiation of  |americium|Americium| , curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249. As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.     Microgram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S.  |Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission|Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission| . Only two sites produce californium-252: the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and the  |Research_Institute_of_Atomic_Reactors|Research_Institute_Of_Atomic_Reactors|  in  |Dimitrovgrad,_Russia|Dimitrovgrad,_Russia| . As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25  grams and 0.025  grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.     Three californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by  |uranium-238|Uranium-238|  without  |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission|  or alpha decay occurring during the process. Californium-253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several  |isotopes_of_plutonium|Isotopes_Of_Plutonium| ,  |americium|Isotopes_Of_Americium| ,  |curium|Isotopes_Of_Curium| ,  |berkelium|Isotopes_Of_Berkelium| , and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 .                     Californium-252 has a number of specialized applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a  |neutron_startup_source|Neutron_Startup_Source|  for some nuclear reactors and as a portable neutron source for  |neutron_activation_analysis|Neutron_Activation_Analysis|  to detect trace amounts of elements in samples.   Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain  |cervical|Cervical_Cancer|  and  |brain_cancers|Brain_Cancer|  where other  |radiation_therapy|Radiation_Therapy|  is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the  |Georgia_Institute_of_Technology|Georgia_Institute_Of_Technology|  received a loan of 119  µg of californium-252 from the  |Savannah_River_Plant|Savannah_River_Plant| . It is also used with online elemental  |coal_analyzers|Coal_Analyzer|  and  |bulk_material_analyzers|Bulk_Material_Analyzer|  in the coal and cement industries.     Neutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as  |fuel_rod|Fuel_Rod|  scanners;  |neutron_radiography|Neutron_Radiography|  of aircraft and weapons components to detect  |corrosion|Corrosion| , bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture;  and in portable metal detectors.   |Neutron_moisture_gauges|Neutron_Moisture_Gauge|  use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable  |neutron_source|Neutron_Source|  for gold and silver prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement.  The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up , fuel rod scanning , and activation analysis . By 1994, most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography , with fuel rod scanning and reactor start-up as important but distant secondary uses.     Californium-251 has a very small calculated  |critical_mass|Critical_Mass|  of about ,  high lethality, and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.     In October 2006, researchers announced that three atoms of  |oganesson|Oganesson|  had been identified at the  |Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research|Joint_Institute_For_Nuclear_Research|  in  |Dubna|Dubna| ,  |Russia|Russia| , as the product of bombardment of californium-249 with  |calcium-48|Calcium-48| , making it the heaviest element ever synthesized. The target for this experiment contained about 10  mg of californium-249 deposited on a titanium foil of 32  cm 2 area.     Californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements; for example, element 103  was first synthesized in 1961 by bombarding californium with  |boron|Boron|  nuclei.        Californium that  |bioaccumulates|Bioaccumulate|  in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the bodys ability to form  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cell| . The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.     Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.     The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through  |gamma_ray|Gamma_Ray|  emission.  |Ionizing_radiation|Ionizing_Radiation|  emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.
