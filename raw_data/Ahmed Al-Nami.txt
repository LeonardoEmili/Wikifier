Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Nami  was one of four  |hijackers|Hijackers_In_The_September_11_Attacks|  of  |United_Airlines_Flight_93|United_Airlines_Flight_93|  as part of the  |September_11_attacks|September_11_Attacks| .     Born in  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| , Nami had served as a  |muezzin|Muezzin|  and was a college student. He left his family in 2000 to complete the  |Hajj|Hajj| , but later went to  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  bound for an  |al-Qaeda|Al-Qaeda|  training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks.     He arrived in the  |United_States|United_States|  in May 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in  |Florida|Florida|  up until the attacks. On September 11, 2001, Nami boarded  |United_93|United_Airlines_Flight_93|  and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in rural  |Shanksville,_Pennsylvania|Shanksville,_Pennsylvania|  after a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the three other hijacked planes that hit the  |World_Trade_Center|World_Trade_Center|  and  |the_Pentagon|The_Pentagon| .       Nami, much like  |Abdulaziz_al-Omari|Abdulaziz_Al-Omari| ,  |Wail_al-Shehri|Wail_Al-Shehri| ,  |Waleed_al-Shehri|Waleed_Al-Shehri|  and  |Mohand_al-Shehri|Mohand_Al-Shehri| , was born in the  |Asir_Province|Asir_Province|  in  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| . Born to the  |Quraish|Quraysh|  tribe of  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia| , Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others Nami served as a  |muezzin|Muezzin|  at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. That autumn he left his family home in  |Abha|Abha|  in the summer of 2000 to complete the  |Hajj|Hajj| , but never returned – instead travelling to the  |Al_Farouq_training_camp|Al_Farouq_Training_Camp|  in  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  where he met and befriended  |Waleed|Waleed_Al-Shehri|  and  |Wail_al-Shehri|Wail_Al-Shehri| , two brothers from  |Khamis_Mushayt|Khamis_Mushayt|  in the same province, and  |Saeed_al-Ghamdi|Saeed_Al-Ghamdi| . The four reportedly pledged themselves to  |Jihad|Jihad|  in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail – who had dubbed himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of  |Muhammads|Muhammad|  companions.  Dubbed Abu Hashim , Nami was considered gentle in manner by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a  |mare|Mare|  along with  |Muhammad|Muhammad| , and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.     During his time at al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under  |Mushabib_al-Hamlans|Mushabib_Al-Hamlan|  details that Nami had recently had  |laser_eye_surgery|Laser_Eye_Surgery| , an uncited fact that does not reappear.     By October he had taken a prospective hijacker  |Mushabib_al-Hamlan|Mushabib_Al-Hamlan|  from  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  to Saudi Arabia where they both procured B-1/B-2 tourist/business visas on October 28 – but Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. Namis visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as student but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles|  – in the end he never used this visa to enter the United States, and reported his  |passport|Passport|   as lost , and procured a new one from  |Jeddah|Jeddah|  . He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa.  He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application. Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.     In mid-November 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that Nami,  |Wail|Wail_Al-Shehri|  and  |Waleed_al-Shehri|Waleed_Al-Shehri| , all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to  |Beirut|Beirut|  and then onward to  |Iran|Iran|  where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get clean passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.     While in the  |United_Arab_Emirates|United_Arab_Emirates| , Nami purchased  |travelers_cheques|Travelers_Cheque|  presumed to have been paid for by  |Mustafa_al-Hawsawi|Mustafa_Al-Hawsawi| . Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including  |Majed_Moqed|Majed_Moqed| ,  |Saeed_al-Ghamdi|Saeed_Al-Ghamdi| ,  |Hamza_al-Ghamdi|Hamza_Al-Ghamdi| ,  |Ahmed_al-Haznawi|Ahmed_Al-Haznawi|  and  |Wail_al-Shehri|Wail_Al-Shehri| .       In March 2001, Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an  |al-Qaeda|Al-Qaeda|  farewell video showing 13 of the muscle hijackers before they left their training centre in  |Kandahar|Kandahar| ; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.     On April 23, Nami was recorded obtaining a new US visa.      On May 28, Nami arrived in the United States from  |Dubai|Dubai|  with fellow-hijackers  |Mohand_al-Shehri|Mohand_Al-Shehri|  and  |Hamza_al-Ghamdi|Hamza_Al-Ghamdi| . By early June, Nami was living in apartment 1504 at the Delray Racquet Club condominiums with  |Saeed_al-Ghamdi|Saeed_Al-Ghamdi|  in  |Delray_Beach,_Florida|Delray_Beach,_Florida| . He  |telephone|Telephone| d his family in Asir shortly after arriving in the country.     In June, he phoned his family for the last time.      He was one of 9 hijackers to open a  |SunTrust|Suntrust|  bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on June 29 received either a Florida State Identification Card or Drivers License.      He may have been one of three hijackers that listed the Naval Air Station in  |Pensacola,_Florida|Pensacola,_Florida|  as their permanent address on drivers licenses, though other sources claim he listed the Delray condominium.     On August 28, Nami and  |Ahmed_al-Haznawi|Ahmed_Al-Haznawi|  reportedly bothered a  |Delray_Beach|Delray_Beach|  resident, Maria Siscar Simpson, to let them through her apartment to retrieve a towel that had fallen off their balcony onto hers.      On September 5, Nami and  |Saeed_al-Ghamdi|Saeed_Al-Ghamdi|  purchased tickets for a September 7 flight to  |Newark|Newark_Liberty_International_Airport|  at Mile High Travel on Commercial Boulevard—paying cash for their tickets.  |Ziad_Jarrah|Ziad_Jarrah|  and  |Ahmed_al-Haznawi|Ahmed_Al-Haznawi|  also purchased tickets for the same flight from Passage Tours.     On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from  |Fort_Lauderdale|Fort_Lauderdale|  to  |Newark_International_Airport|Newark_International_Airport|  aboard  |Spirit_Airlines|Spirit_Airlines| .            On September 11, 2001, Nami arrived in Newark to board  |United_Airlines_Flight_93|United_Airlines_Flight_93|  along with  |Saeed_al-Ghamdi|Saeed_Al-Ghamdi| ,  |Ahmed_al-Haznawi|Ahmed_Al-Haznawi|  and  |Ziad_Jarrah|Ziad_Jarrah| . Some reports suggest Haznawi was pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of  |CCTV|Closed-Circuit_Television|  cameras at the time has compounded the problem. Nami boarded the plane between 7:39  am and 7:48  am; seated in First Class 3C, next to Saeed al-Ghamdi.     Due to the flights routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes Jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.     At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some have questioned may have signified an allegiance to the  |Egyptian_Islamic_Jihad|Egyptian_Islamic_Jihad| . The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.     Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit. The hijackers crashed the plane into the  |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania| n countryside rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.       After the attacks, an employee of  |Saudi_Arabian_Airlines|Saudi_Arabian_Airlines|  named Ahmed al-Nami came forward to say that he feared his identity had been stolen, although he had never lost his passport.       He has been portrayed by British actor  |Jamie_Harding|Jamie_Harding|  in the 2006 film  United 93  and Asim Wali in the film  Flight 93  .
