     The harmonica, also known as a French harp or  mouth organ , is a  |free_reed|Free_Reed_Aerophone| |wind_instrument|Wind_Instrument|  used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in  |blues|Blues| ,  |American_folk_music|American_Folk_Music_Revival| ,  |classical_music|Classical_Music| ,  |jazz|Jazz| ,  |country|Country_Music| ,  |rock|Rock_Music| . There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one  |reed|Reed| . A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the players air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.     Reeds are pre-tuned to individual pitches. Tuning may involve changing a reed’s length, the weight near its free end, or the stiffness near its fixed end. Longer, heavier and springier reeds produce deeper, lower sounds; shorter, lighter and stiffer reeds make higher-pitched sounds. If, as on most modern harmonicas, a reed is affixed above or below its slot rather than in the plane of the slot, it responds more easily to air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot, i.e., as a closing reed. This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a blow reed and a draw reed in the same air chamber and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or leather to block the non-playing reed.     An important technique in performance is bending: causing a drop in pitch by making  |embouchure|Embouchure|  adjustments. It is possible to bend isolated reeds, as on chromatic and other harmonica models with wind-savers, but also to both lower, and raise  the pitch produced by pairs of reeds in the same chamber, as on a diatonic or other unvalved harmonica. Such two-reed pitch changes actually involve sound production by the normally silent reed, the opening reed .              The basic parts of the harmonica are the comb, reed plates and cover plates.       The comb is the main body of the instrument, which, when assembled with the reedplates, forms air chambers for the reeds. The term comb may originate from the similarity between this part of a harmonica and a hair comb. Harmonica combs were traditionally made from wood but now are also made from plastic  or metal . Some modern and experimental comb designs are complex in the way that they direct the air.     There is dispute among players about whether comb material affects the tone of a harmonica. Those saying no argue that, unlike the soundboard of a piano or the top piece of a violin or guitar, a harmonicas comb is neither large enough nor able to vibrate freely enough to substantially augment or change the sound. Among those saying yes are those who are convinced by their ears. Few dispute, however, that comb surface smoothness and air-tightness when mated with the reedplates can greatly affect tone and playability. The main advantage of a particular comb material over another one is its durability.  In particular, a wooden comb can absorb moisture from the players breath and contact with the tongue. This can cause the comb to expand slightly, making the instrument uncomfortable to play, and to then contract, potentially compromising air tightness. Various types of wood and treatments have been devised to reduce the degree of this problem.     An even more serious problem with wood combs, especially in chromatic harmonicas , is that, as the combs expand and shrink over time, cracks can form in the combs, because the comb is held immobile by nails, resulting in disabling leakage. Serious players devote significant effort to restoring wood combs and sealing leaks. Some players used to soak wooden-combed harmonicas  in water to cause a slight expansion, which they intended to make the seal between the comb, reed plates and covers more airtight. Modern wooden-combed harmonicas are less prone to swelling and contracting, but modern players still dip their harmonicas in water for the way it affects tone and ease of bending notes.       The reed plate is a grouping of several reeds in a single housing. The reeds are usually made of brass, but steel, aluminium and plastic are occasionally used. Individual reeds are usually riveted to the reed plate, but they may also be welded or screwed in place. Reeds fixed on the inner side of the reed plate respond to blowing, while those fixed on the outer side respond to suction.     Most harmonicas are constructed with the reed plates screwed or bolted to the comb or each other. A few brands still use the traditional method of nailing the reed plates to the comb. Some experimental and rare harmonicas also have had the reed plates held in place by tension, such as the WWII era all-American models. If the plates are bolted to the comb, the reed plates can be replaced individually. This is useful because the reeds eventually go out of tune through normal use, and certain notes of the scale can fail more quickly than others.     A notable exception to the traditional reed plate design is the all-plastic harmonicas designed by Finn Magnus in the 1950s, in which the reed and reed plate were molded out of a single piece of plastic. The Magnus design had the reeds, reed plates and comb made of plastic and either molded or permanently glued together.       Cover plates cover the reed plates and are usually made of metal, though wood and plastic have also been used. The choice of these is personal; because they project sound, they determine the tonal quality of the harmonica. There are two types of cover plates: traditional open designs of stamped metal or plastic, which are simply there to be held; and enclosed designs , which offer a louder tonal quality. From these two basic types, a few modern designs have been created, such as the Hohner CBH-2016 chromatic and the  |Suzuki|Suzuki_Musical_Instrument_Corporation|  Overdrive diatonic, which have complex covers that allow for specific functions not usually available in the traditional design. It was not unusual in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for harmonicas to have special features on the covers, such as  |bells|Bell| , which could be rung by pushing a button.       Windsavers are one-way valves made from thin strips of plastic, knit paper, leather or Teflon glued to the reed plate. They are typically found in chromatic harmonicas, chord harmonicas and many octave-tuned harmonicas. Windsavers are used when two reeds share a cell and leakage through the nonplaying reed would be significant. For example, when a draw note is played, the valve on the blow reed-slot is sucked shut, preventing air from leaking through the inactive blow reed. An exception to this is the now-discontinued Hohner XB-40, on which valves are placed not to isolate single reeds but rather to isolate entire chambers from being active, a design that made it possible to play traditional blues bends on all reeds.       The mouthpiece is placed between the air chambers of the instrument and the players mouth. This can be integral with the comb ; part of the cover ; or may be a separate unit, secured by screws, which is typical of chromatics. In many harmonicas, the mouthpiece is purely an ergonomic aid designed to make playing more comfortable. However, in the traditional slider-based chromatic harmonica, it is essential to the functioning of the instrument because it provides a groove for the slide.                Since the 1950s, many blues harmonica players have amplified their instrument with microphones and  |tube_amplifiers|Instrument_Amplifier| . One of the early innovators of this approach was Marion  |Little_Walter|Little_Walter|  Jacobs, who played the harmonica near a Bullet microphone marketed for use by radio taxi dispatchers. This gave his harmonica tone a punchy midrange sound that could be heard above an electric guitar. As well, tube amplifiers produce a natural growling  |overdrive|Distortion|  when cranked at higher volumes, which adds body, fullness and grit to the sound. Little Walter also cupped his hands around the instrument, tightening the air around the harp, giving it a powerful, distorted sound, somewhat reminiscent of a saxophone, hence the term Mississippi saxophone . Some harmonica players in folk use a regular vocal mic, such as a  |Shure_SM_58|Shure_Sm_58|  for their harmonica, which gives a clean, natural sound.     As technology in amplification has progressed, harmonica players have introduced other  |effects_units|Effects_Unit|  to their rigs as well, such as  |reverb|Spring_Reverb| ,  |tremolo|Tremolo| ,  |delay|Delay| ,  |octave|Octave| , additional  |overdrive|Distortion|  pedals, and  |chorus_effect|Chorus_Effect| .  |John_Popper|John_Popper|  of  |Blues_Traveler|Blues_Traveler|  uses a customized microphone that encapsulates several of these effects into one handheld unit, as opposed to several units in sequence. Many harmonica players still prefer tube amplifiers to  |solid-state|Solid-State_Amplifier| , owing to the perceived difference in tone generated by the  |vacuum_tubes|Vacuum_Tubes| . Players perceive tubes as having a warmer tone and a more natural overdrive sound. Many amplifiers designed for  |electric_guitar|Electric_Guitar|  are also used by harmonica players, such as the  |Kalamazoo_Model_Two|Gibson_Kalamazoo_Electric_Guitarkalamazoo_Amplifiers| ,  |Fender_Bassman|Fender_Bassman| , and the  |Danelectro_Commando|Danelectro_Commando| . Some expensive, handmade  |boutique_amplifiers|Boutique_Amplifiers| , however, are built from the ground up with characteristics that are optimal for amplified harmonica.            Harmonica players who play the instrument while performing on another instrument with their hands often use an accessory called a neck rack or harmonica holder to position the instrument in front of their mouth. A harmonica holder clamps the harmonica between two metal brackets, which are attached to a curved loop of metal that rests on the shoulders. The original harmonica racks were made from wire or coat hangers. Models of harmonica racks vary widely by quality and ease of use, and it quite often takes experimenting with more than one model of harmonica rack to find one that feels suitable for each individual player. This device is used by folk musicians,  |one-man_bands|One-Man_Band|  and singer-songwriters such as  |Bob_Dylan|Bob_Dylan| ,  |Tom_Harmon|Tom_Harmon| ,  |Neil_Young|Neil_Young| ,  |Eddie_Vedder|Eddie_Vedder| ,  |Billy_Joel|Billy_Joel| ,  |Bruce_Springsteen|Bruce_Springsteen|  and blues singers  |Jimmy_Reed|Jimmy_Reed|  and  |John_Hammond_Jr.|John_Hammond_Jr.|                The chromatic harmonica uses a button-activated sliding bar to redirect air from the hole in the mouthpiece to the selected reed-plate, though one design—the Machino-Tone —controlled airflow by means of a lever-operated flap on the rear of the instrument. Also, a hands-free modification to the Hohner 270 lets the player shift the tones by moving the mouthpiece up and down with the lips, leaving the hands free to play another instrument. While the  |Richter-tuned|Richter_Tuning|  10-hole chromatic is intended to play in only one key, the 12-, 14-, and 16-hole models allow the musician to play in any key desired with only one harmonica. This harp can be used for any style, including Celtic, classical, jazz, or blues .       Strictly speaking, diatonic denotes any harmonica designed to play in a single key—though the standard Richter-tuned harmonica diatonic can play other keys by forcing its reeds to play tones that are not part of its basic scale. Depending on the country, diatonic harmonica may mean either the tremolo harmonica or blues harp . Other diatonic harmonicas include octave harmonicas.     Here is the note layout for a standard diatonic in the key of G major:     :     Each hole is the same  |interval|Interval|   from its key of C counterpart; on the diatonic scale, a G is a perfect fifth from C. The interval between keys can be used to find the note layout of any standard diatonic.             The distinguishing feature of the tremolo-tuned harmonica is that it has two reeds per note, with one slightly sharp and the other slightly flat. This provides a unique wavering or warbling sound created by the two reeds being slightly out of tune with each other and the difference in their subsequent waveforms interacting with each other . The Asian version, which can produce all 12 semitones, is used often in East Asian rock and pop music.       Orchestral harmonicas are primarily designed for use in ensemble playing.       There are eight kinds of orchestral melody harmonica; the most common are the horn harmonicas often found in East Asia. These consist of a single large comb with blow-only reed-plates on the top and bottom. Each reed sits inside a single cell in the comb. One version mimics the layout of a piano or mallet instrument, with the natural notes of a C diatonic scale in the lower reed plate and the sharps and flats in the upper reed plate in groups of two and three holes with gaps in between like the black keys of a piano. Another version has one sharp reed directly above its natural on the lower plate, with the same number of reeds on both plates .     Horn harmonicas are available in several pitch ranges, with the lowest pitched starting two octaves below middle C and the highest beginning on middle C itself; they usually cover a two- or three-octave range. They are chromatic instruments and are usually played in an East Asian harmonica orchestra instead of the  |push-button|Push-Button|  chromatic harmonica that is more common in the European and American tradition. Their reeds are often larger, and the enclosing horn gives them a different timbre, so that they often function in place of a brass section. In the past, they were referred to as horn harmonicas.     The other type of orchestral melodic harmonica is the polyphonia, . These have all twelve chromatic notes laid out on the same row. In most cases, they have both blow and draw of the same tone, though the No. 7 is blow only, and the No. 261, also blow only, has two reeds per hole, tuned an octave apart .       The chord harmonica has up to 48 chords:  |major|Major_Chord| ,  |seventh|Seventh_Chord| ,  |minor|Minor_Chord| ,  |augmented|Augmented_Chord|  and  |diminished|Diminished_Triad|  for ensemble playing. It is laid out in four-note clusters, each sounding a different chord on inhaling or exhaling. Typically each hole has two reeds for each note, tuned to one octave of each other. However, less expensive models often have only one reed per note. Quite a few orchestra harmonicas are also designed to serve as both bass and chord harmonica, with bass notes next to chord groupings. There are also other chord harmonicas, such as the Chordomonica , and the junior chord harmonicas .     The Suzuki SSCH-56 Compact Chord harmonica is a 48-chord harmonica built in a 14-hole chromatic harmonica enclosure. The first three holes play a major chord on blow and draw, with and without the slide. Holes 2, 3, and 4 play a diminished chord; holes 3, 4, and 5 play a minor chord; and holes 4, 5, and 6 play an augmented, for a total of sixteen chords. This pattern is repeated starting on hole 5, a whole step higher; and again starting on hole 9, for a total of 48 chords.       The ChengGong harmonica  harmonica, invented by Cheng Xuexue  of China. has a main body, and a sliding mouthpiece. The body is a 24-hole diatonic harmonica that ranges from B 2 to D 6 . Its 11-hole mouthpiece can slide along the front of the harmonica, which gives numerous chord choices and voicings . As well, it is capable of playing single-note melodies and double stops over a range of three diatonic octaves. Unlike conventional harmonicas, blowing and drawing produce the same notes because its tuning is closer to the note layout of a typical Asian tremolo harmonica or the Polyphonias.       The  |pitch_pipe|Pitch_Pipe|  is a simple specialty harmonica that provides a reference pitch to singers and other instruments. The only difference between some early pitch-pipes and harmonicas is the name of the instrument, which reflected the makers target audience. Chromatic pitch pipes, which are used by singers and choirs, give a full chromatic octave. Pitch pipes are also sold for string players, such as violinists and guitarists; these pitch pipes usually provide the notes corresponding to the open strings.            Vibrato is a technique commonly used while playing the harmonica and many other instruments, to give the note a shaking sound. This technique can be accomplished in a number of ways. The most common way is to change how the harmonica is held. For example, the vibrato effect can be achieved by opening and closing the hands around the harmonica very rapidly. The vibrato might also be achieved via rapid glottal opening and closing, especially on draws simultaneous to bending, or without bending. This obviates the need for cupping and waving the hands around the instrument during play. An effect similar to vibrato is that of the trill ; this technique has the player move their lips between two holes very quickly, either by shaking the head in a rapid motion or moving the harmonica from side to side within the embouchure. This gives a quick pitch-alternating technique that is slightly more than vibrato and achieves the same aural effect on sustained notes, albeit by using two different tones instead of varying the amplitude of one.     In addition to the 19 notes readily available on the diatonic harmonica, players can play other notes by adjusting their  |embouchure|Embouchure|  and forcing the reed to resonate at a different pitch. This technique is called bending, a term possibly borrowed from guitarists, who literally bend a string to subtly change the pitch. Bending also creates the glissandos characteristic of much blues harp and country harmonica playing. Bends are essential for most blues and rock harmonica due to the soulful sounds the instrument can bring out. The wail of the blues harp typically requires bending. In the 1970s,  |Howard_Levy|Howard_Levy|  developed the over bending technique Over Bending, combined with bending, allowed players to play the entire chromatic scale.     In addition to playing the diatonic harmonica in its original key, it is also possible to play it in other keys by playing in other positions using different keynotes. Using just the basic notes on the instrument would mean playing in a specific mode for each position. For example the Mixolydian mode , produces a major dominant seventh key that is frequently used by blues players because it contains the harmonically rich dominant seventh note, while the Dorian mode produces a minor dominant seventh key. Harmonica players have developed terminology around different positions, which can be confusing to other musicians, for example the slang terminology for the most common positions .     Another technique, seldom used to its full potential, is altering the size of the mouth cavity to emphasize certain natural  |overtones|Overtones| . When this technique is employed while playing chords, care must be taken in overtone selection as the overtones stemming from the non-root pitch can cause extreme dissonance.     Harmonica players who amplify their instrument with microphones and tube amplifiers, such as blues harp players, also have a range of techniques that exploit properties of the microphone and the amplifier, such as changing the way the hands are cupped around the instrument and the microphone or rhythmically breathing or chanting into the microphone while playing. Blues and folk players refer to the instrument with a range of less common names, including hand reed, Mississippi saxophone, licking stick, pocket sax, toe pickle, tin sandwich, ten-holed tin-can tongue twister, blues burger, harpoon, moothie, and French harp.       The harmonica was developed in Europe in the early part of the 19th century. Free-reed instruments like the Chinese  |sheng|Sheng|  were fairly common in Asia since ancient times. They became relatively well known in Europe after being introduced by the French Jesuit  |Jean_Joseph_Marie_Amiot|Jean_Joseph_Marie_Amiot|  , who lived in  |Qing-era|Qianlong_Emperor|  China.
