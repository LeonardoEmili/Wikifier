     The Ringworld  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction| |_role_playing_game|Role_Playing_Game|  was published by  |Chaosium|Chaosium|  in 1984, using the  |Basic_Role_Playing|Basic_Role_Playing|  system for its rules and  |Larry_Nivens|Larry_Niven| |_Ringworld_novels|Ringworld_Novels|  as a setting.       The setting is a distant future based on extrapolation of as much  |hard_science|Hard_Science|  as Niven had available. Specifically, its the 29th century.  |Known_Space|Known_Space|   is about 80 light years in diameter with 10,000 stars, including Human Space , as well as neighbouring Alien civilisations. Important Alien civilisations include the  |Puppeteers|Piersons_Puppeteer| , paranoid pacifist herbivore centaurs, and the  |Kzinti|Kzinti| , carnivorous warlike felines, who fought multiple wars over hundreds of years against the Humans, being defeated each time. Human allies include intelligent  |dolphins|Dolphins|  and  |orcas|Orcas| .     Known Space only serves as a background for the game. The game is intended to be set on the  |Ringworld|Ringworld|  itself, an enormous single world discovered at the far reaches of Known Space, a ring around a sun at approximately the orbit of the Earth. It is 997,000 miles wide, about 125 Earth-diameters. The total inner surface of the ring is equal to that of 3 million Earths. The ring is spun at a speed to provide 0.992G of gravity on the innerside, while 20 giant shadow squares at about the orbit of Mercury occlude the Sun to provide night. It was constructed by the  |Pak_Protectors|Pak_Protectors| , now mostly extinct, who had a common origin with humans. The Ringworld is home to some 30 trillion sentient inhabitants from up to 2000  |hominid|Hominidae|  species. The world is described in a series of novels by Niven,  Ringworld ,  The Ringworld Engineers , and, after the games publication,  The Ringworld Throne  and  Ringworlds Children .     The role-playing game contains a great deal of technical details about the setting, more than the fiction the setting is based on. The game setting details are complete enough that some Ringworld fans not interested in role-playing buy the game just for the background material.     Information from the RPG, along with notes composed by RPG author Hewitt with Niven, were later used to form the Bible given to authors writing in the  Man-Kzin Wars  series. Niven himself recommended that Hewitt write one of the stories for the original two MKW books, although this never came to pass.  Scatterbrain , pp. 293-301       The players initially play explorers from Known Space, sent as scouts to the Ringworld. They can be anthropologists, artists, doctors, police, or even zealots, who will explore the mysteries of this huge artificial world and its inhabitants. Basic characters can be humans from a dozen planets of Human Space, Puppeteers, or Kzin. Later play can see characters from Ringworld species, such as the Ghouls, Vampires, Giants, Sea People, and others.     This Ringworld focus has been a criticism of the game. The Ringworld role-playing game is not a full science fiction RPG, like  Traveller , including, for example, rules for starship construction, space combat, travel to different planets and systems, and so forth. Instead, the game and rules focused on parties of characters exploring the Ringworld itself, and, despite its vast size , many who bought the game felt limited by this one world setting.       A character is initially defined by his species or world of origin, which affects characteristics . Then the players roll randomly for a certain number of defects, character age, and characteristics. The system used is Chaosiums  |Basic_Role_Playing|Basic_Role_Playing| , with eight basic  |characteristics|Statistic_Attributes| |hit_points|Hit_Points| , and skill rolls.     At creation, each character gets to spend a number of points on skills determined by interests or career choice. Each of the three playable races has specific tables for the creation of characters. Character Skills are based on percentages. To succeed in a skill, the player must roll under the relevant skill with modifiers on  |percentile_dice|Percentile_Dice| .     Another critique of the game system has been the large effect of character age on skills, usually considered the most important character attributes. In Nivens future world, the deterioration of age has been largely reversed, so humans live hundreds of years. Therefore, a 200-year-old character will have vastly more skill points than a 20-year-old, with little compensatory advantages for the younger one.            Only two publications were published, the Ringworld role-playing game box set itself, and the Ringworld Companion, both in 1984 by Chaosium. The magazine  Different Worlds , issue 37, featured a Ringworld adventure, Louis Wu & His Motley Crew. The article The Dolphins of Known Space: A new race for the Ringworld Game appeared in  Dragon Magazine  issue 95.     Ringworld Box SetRingworld role-playing game box set was titled Larry Nivens Ringworld: Roleplaying Adventure Beneath the Great Arch , referring to the way the Ringworld looked from its interior surface. The authors are credited as  |Greg_Stafford|Greg_Stafford| , John Hewitt,  |Sherman_Kahn|Sherman_Kahn| ,  |Lynn_Willis|Lynn_Willis| ,  |Sandy_Petersen|Sandy_Petersen| ,  |Rudy_Kraft|Rudy_Kraft| ,  |Charlie_Krank|Charlie_Krank| ,  |Ed_Gore|Ed_Gore| , and  |Jeff_Okamoto|Jeff_Okamoto| . It came in a box set with four books: the Explorer Book, Technology Book, Gamemasters Book, and Creatures Book, a sheet of cardboard miniatures, reference and character sheets, and a set of  |dice|Dice| , Canyon, Down, Gummidgy, Home, Jinx, Margrave, Plateau, Silvereyes, We Made It and Wunderland. Finally, it gives rules for non-human, Kzin or Puppeteer, player characters, and a glossary.       The Gamemaster Book begins with technical essays on the Ringworld, from physical construction, to life on the ring, with diagrams. There is a section on the City Builders â€”a Ringworld race that dominated the Ringworld, built floating cities, and sent spaceships to explore other worlds, until a mysterious technological virus destroyed their empire. Another section lists unanswered questions about the Ringworld. There are suggestions for creating scenarios and campaigns, and information on technology of various humanoid species of the Ringworld, and additional rules, including gravity, Credit Rating, and  |psionics|Psionics| . There is also an introductory scenario intended to begin a Ringworld campaign. The characters are hired by Captain Gregor Lopez, famous explorer, for a journey to the Ringworld that does not go completely as planned.       The Technology Book gives rules and descriptions of the equipment employed by the explorers of the 29th century, categorized into generators, computers, medical equipment, tools, vehicles, weapons and defenses.       The Creature Book gives rules and descriptions for creatures, divided into Aliens, Humanoids, Animals and Plants. Many races get specialized hit location tables, characteristic maxima and minima, skills and traits.     Ringworld Companion |spaceships|Spaceships|  ,  |hyperspace|Hyperspace| , a map of Human Space, and statistics for vehicles used on the Ringworld. Then there is a new race, the Agamans , desert nomads, and a scenario involving them, The Sand Eaters . Finally, there is a three part scenario named The Kaladians , about the defense of travelling merchants. Both scenarios can be integrated into the campaign given in the basic set. None of these three additional races appear in any of the Ringworld novels.        |Steve_Peterson|Steve_Peterson|  reviewed Ringworld in  Space Gamer  No. 71.  Peterson commented that Niven fans should buy it for the essays and background materials. Role-players should be prepared to do some work on scenarios; but if you do, youll have some terrific roleplaying in a beautifully detailed world. Science-fiction gamers who want to use it for source material probably wont get their moneys worth.        Different Worlds  37    White Dwarf  59    Shadis  .
