           The Pakistan Armed Forces  are the  |military_forces|Armed_Forces|  of  |Pakistan|Pakistan| . They are the  |sixth_largest|List_Of_Countries_By_Number_Of_Troops|  in the world in terms of active military personnel and the largest among  |Muslim_countries|Muslim_World| . The armed forces comprise four main service branches –  |Army|Pakistan_Army| ,  |Navy|Pakistan_Navy| ,  |Air_Force|Pakistan_Air_Force|  and  |paramilitary_forces|Paramilitary_Forces_Of_Pakistan|  and the  |Strategic_Plans_Division_Force|Strategic_Plans_Division_Force| .  |Chain_of_command|Chain_Of_Command|  of the military is organised under the  |Chairman|Chairman_Joint_Chiefs_Of_Staff_Committee|  of  |Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_Committee|Joint_Chiefs_Of_Staff_Committee|  alongside chiefs of staff of the  |army|Chief_Of_Army_Staff| ,  |navy|Chief_Of_Naval_Staff| , and  |air_force|Chief_Of_Air_Staff| .  All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions under the  |Joint_Staff_Headquarters|Joint_Staff_Headquarters|  .     Since the 1963  |Sino-Pakistan_Agreement|Sino-Pakistan_Agreement| , the military has had close  |military_relations_with_China|Military_Relations_Between_China_And_Pakistan| , working jointly to develop the  |JF-17|Jf-17_Thunder| , the  |K-8|K-8_Karakorum| , and other weapons systems.  China was the second-largest foreign supplier of  |military_equipment|Military_Equipment|  to Pakistan. Both nations also co-operate on development of  |nuclear|Nuclear_Technology|  and  |space_technology|Space_Program|  programs.    Their armies have a schedule for organising joint military exercises.  The military also maintains close  |relations_with_the_United_States|Pakistan–United_States_Relations| , which gave Pakistan  |major_non-NATO_ally|Major_Non-Nato_Ally|  status in 2004. Pakistan gets the bulk of its military equipment from local  |domestic_suppliers|Defence_Industry_Of_Pakistan| , China, and the United States.      The armed forces were formed in 1947 when Pakistan became  |independent|Pakistan_Independence_Movement|  from the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| . Since then, the armed forces have played a decisive role in the modern  |history_of_Pakistan|History_Of_Pakistan| , fighting  |major_wars_with_India|Indo-Pakistani_Wars_And_Conflicts|  in  |1947|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1947| ,  |1965|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1965|  and  |1971|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1971| , and on several occasions seizing control of the  |government|Government_Of_Pakistan| .  The need for border management led to the creation of paramilitary forces to deal with civil unrest in the North-West and security of border areas in Punjab and Sindh by paramilitary troops. In 2017, there were approximately 654,000 active personnel in the armed forces, excluding 25,000–35,000+ personnel in the  |Strategic_Plans_Division_Forces|Strategic_Plans_Division_Force|  and 482,000 active personnel in the paramilitary forces.  The armed forces have a large pool of volunteers so conscription has never been needed, though the Pakistani constitution and supplementary legislation allow for conscription in a state of war.      Accounting for 18.5% of national government expenditure in 2018, after interest payments, Pakistans military absorbs the largest part of the countrys budget.   The armed forces are generally highly approved of in  |Pakistani_society|Pakistani_Society| .  Since the founding of Pakistan, the military has played a key role in holding the state together, promoting a feeling of nationhood and providing a bastion of selfless service. . Globalsecurity.org.

As of May 2019, Pakistan was the sixth-largest contributor to  |United_Nations|United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Missions_Involving_Pakistan|  peacekeeping efforts, with 5,083 personnel  |deployed_overseas|Pakistan_Armed_Forces_Deployments| .  Other foreign deployments have consisted of Pakistani military personnel serving as  |military_advisers|Military_Adviser|  in African and  |Arab|Arab_World|  countries. The Pakistani military has maintained combat divisions and brigade-strength presences in some of the Arab countries during the  |Arab–Israeli_Wars|Arab–Israeli_Conflict| , aided the Coalition forces in the first  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| , and took part in the Somali and Bosnian conflicts.               The Pakistan military has its roots in the  |British_Indian_Army|British_Indian_Army| , in which many British Indian Muslims served  |during_World_War_II|Indian_Army_During_World_War_Ii| , prior to the  |Partition_of_India|Partition_Of_India| .  Upon Partition, military formations with a Muslim majority were transferred to Pakistan, while on an individual basis Indian Muslims could choose to transfer their allegiance to the new Pakistani military. Those who did so included  |Ayub_Khan|Ayub_Khan|  ,  |Haji_Mohammad_Siddiq_Choudri|Haji_Mohammad_Siddiq_Choudri|  , and  |Asghar_Khan|Asghar_Khan|  . Many of the senior officers who would form the Pakistan Armed Forces had fought with the  |British_forces|British_Armed_Forces|  in World War II, thus providing the newly created country with the professionalism, experience, and leadership it would need in its wars against India.  In a formula arranged by the British, military resources were to have been divided between  |India_and_Pakistan|India_And_Pakistan|  in a ratio of 64% going to India and 36% for Pakistan; however, Pakistan initially demanded 50% of the equipment.      The Pakistani military retained  |British_military|British_Military|  traditions and doctrine until 1956, when the United States dispatched a special  |Military_Assistance_Advisory_Group|Military_Assistance_Advisory_Group|  to Pakistan; from this point,  |American_military|United_States_Armed_Forces|  tradition and doctrine was generally adopted by Pakistans military.  In March 1956, the Pakistani military order of precedence of three services changed from Navy-Army-Air Force to Army-Navy-Air Force . In the 1990s, the additional reforms of the military eventually changed the order of precedence to Army-Navy-Air Force-Marines; though the Marines remained part of the Navy, not a separate service branch.      Between 1947 and 1971, Pakistan has fought three direct conventional  |wars_against_India|Indo-Pakistani_Wars_And_Conflicts| , with the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1971|  witnessing the  |secession|Secession|  of  |East_Pakistan|East_Pakistan|  as independent  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh| . In the latter war, the Pakistan Armed Forces were the main perpetrators of the  |Bangladesh_genocide|Bangladesh_Genocide| , in which, most independent researchers estimate, around 300,000 to 500,000 people were killed and 200,000 to 400,000 were raped, while the Bangladesh government claims the number of deaths was as high as 3,000,000.     Rising tensions with  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan|  in the 1960s and an indirect  |proxy_war|Proxy_War|  fought against the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  in the 1970s led to a sharp rise in the development of the Pakistan Armed Forces.  In 1999, an extended period of intense border-skirmishing with India, the so-called  |Kargil_War|Kargil_War| , resulted in a redeployment of forces.   the military has been conducting counterinsurgency operations along the border areas of Afghanistan, while continuing to participate in several United Nations peacekeeping operations.     Since 1957, the armed forces have taken control from the  |civilian_government|Government_Of_Pakistan|  in various  |military_coups|Military_Coups_In_Pakistan|  – ostensibly to restore order in the country, citing corruption and gross inefficiency on the part of the civilian leadership. While many Pakistanis have supported these seizures of power,  others have claimed that political instability, lawlessness, and corruption are direct consequences of military rule.                  It is estimated that approximately 60–70% of Pakistans military personnel are deployed along the  |Indo-Pakistan_border|India-Pakistan_Border| .  In the aftermath of the United States  |invasion_of_Afghanistan|War_In_Afghanistan| , more than 150,000 personnel were shifted towards the  |Tribal_Areas|Tribal_Areas_Of_Pakistan|  adjacent to Afghanistan.  Since 2004, Pakistans military forces have been engaged in  |military_efforts|War_In_North-West_Pakistan|  against  |al-Qaeda|Al-Qaeda|  extremists.     In comparison with  |multinational|International_Security_Assistance_Force|  and US forces, Pakistans military has suffered the highest number of casualties in the war on terror, both in confrontations with al-Qaeda and during  |border_skirmishes_with_the_United_States|Pakistan–United_States_Skirmishes| . After the  |2008_Mumbai_attacks|2008_Mumbai_Attacks|  and the subsequent standoff with India, several combat divisions were redeployed to Eastern and  |Southern_Pakistan|Sindh| .     In addition to its military deployments, the armed forces also assist the government in responding to natural disasters such as the  |2005_Kashmir_earthquake|2005_Kashmir_Earthquake|  and the  |nationwide_floods_of_2010|2010_Pakistan_Floods| .            A large number of Pakistan Armed Forces personnel are deployed overseas as part of the United Nations peacekeeping missions. As of May 2019, 5,083 personnel were serving abroad, making Pakistan the sixth-largest contributor of personnel to UN peacekeeping missions.       Leadership of the Pakistan Armed Forces is provided by the  |Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_Committee|Joint_Chiefs_Of_Staff_Committee|  , which controls the military from the  |Joint_staff_Headquarters|Joint_Staff_Headquarters|  , adjacent to the  |Air_HQ|Ahq| ,  |Navy_HQ|Nhq| , and  |Army_General_HQ|General_Headquarters|  in the vicinity of the  |Rawalpindi_Military_District|Rawalpindi_Cantonment| , Punjab. The Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee is composed of the  |Chairman_Joint_Chiefs|Chairman_Joint_Chiefs_Of_Staff_Committee| , the  |Chief_of_Army_Staff|Chief_Of_Army_Staff| , the  |Chief_of_Air_Staff|Chief_Of_Air_Staff| , the  |Chief_of_Naval_Staff|Chief_Of_Naval_Staff| , the Commandant Marines, and the Commander of the Special Plans Division.

Following military failures in the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1971|  and  |Bangladesh_Liberation_War|Bangladesh_Liberation_War| , federal studies on  |civil–military_relations|Civil–Military_Relations|  were held by a commission led by  |Hamoodur_Rahman|Hamoodur_Rahman| ,  |Chief_Justice_of_Pakistan|Chief_Justice_Of_Pakistan| . Recommendations of the  |Hamoodur_Rahman_Commission|Hamoodur_Rahman_Commission|  helped establish the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee to co-ordinate all military work and oversee joint missions and their execution during operations.      The chairmanship of the JCSC rotates among the three main service branches, with appointment by the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Pakistan|  confirmed by the  |president|President_Of_Pakistan| . The chairman outranks all other four-star officers; however, he does not have operational command authority over the armed forces.  In his capacity as chief military adviser, he assists the prime minister and the minister of defence in exercising their command functions.     Technically, the JCSC is the highest military body; and its chairman serves as the principal staff officer to the civilian prime minister,  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_Pakistan| ,  |National_Security_Council|National_Security_Council|  , and  |president|President_Of_Pakistan| . The JCSC deals with joint military planning, joint training, integrated joint logistics, and provides strategic directions for the armed forces; it periodically reviews the role, size, and condition of the three main service branches; and it advises the civilian government on strategic communications, industrial mobilisations plans, and formulating defence plans. In many ways, the JCSC provides an important link to understand, maintain balance, and resolve conflicts between military and  |political_circles|Politics_Of_Pakistan| .  In times of peace, the JCSCs principle functions are to conduct planning of civil–military input; in times of war, the  |chairman|Chairman_Joint_Chiefs_Of_Staff_Committee|  acts as principal military adviser to the  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Pakistan|  in the supervision and conduct of  |joint_warfare|Joint_Warfare| .                  estimations by national and international bodies were that approximately 654,000 people The Military Balance 2010, p. 367,  |International_Institute_for_Strategic_Studies|International_Institute_For_Strategic_Studies|  . were on active duty in the three main service branches, with an additional 482,000 serving in paramilitary forces and 550,000 in reserve.

The following table summarises current Pakistani military staffing:                 From 1947 to the early 2000s, Pakistans military uniforms closely resembled those of their counterparts in the  |British_armed_services|Her_Majestys_Armed_Forces| .  The  |Army|Pakistan_Army|  uniform consisted of plain yellowish  |khaki|Khaki| , which was the standard issue as both the  |combat_uniform|Combat_Uniforms|  and the  |service_uniform|Army_Service_Uniform|  . The  |Pakistan_Air_Force|Pakistan_Air_Force|  uniform was primarily based on the  |Royal_Air_Force_uniform|Royal_Air_Force_Uniform| , with bluish-grey as its reporting colour markings. The  |Navy|Pakistan_Navy|  uniform was likewise based on the  |Royal_Navy_uniform|Royal_Navy_Uniform| , with predominant colours of navy blue and white.       In 2003, the service uniforms for each major service branch were revised and orders were made to issue new uniforms roughly based on the  |American|United_States_Military|  military. With  |Marines|Pakistan_Marines|  reestablished in 2004, the  |Universal_Camouflage_Pattern|Universal_Camouflage_Pattern|  uniforms are now worn by each service in respect to their colours; the  |flag_of_Pakistan|Flag_Of_Pakistan|  patch worn on the shoulder became compulsory.      In the military, the  |service_dress|Service_Dress| , however, remains yellowish khaki for the Army; plain white service dress for the Navy . The Air Force abandoned its rank and uniform structure in 2006, and introduced its own uniform insignia which closely resembled that of the  |Turkish_Army|Turkish_Army| .     The Armys standard UCP is based on a  |pixelated|Pixelization|  version of the regions arid desert patterns.  The armys UCP varies depending on the type of missions and deployment it is being used for. The Navys UCP is based on a design that incorporates sparse black and medium grey shapes on a light grey background. The Marines have a  |woodland|Woodland|  pattern featuring light brown, olive green and dark blue shapes on a tan or light olive background. Slight colour variations have been noted. Other than a greenish  |flight_suit|Flight_Suit|  and a standard service dress, the Air Forcess  |Airman_Battle_Uniform|Airman_Battle_Uniform|  camouflage features a variation of the six-colour desert pattern. In each services UCP, the name of the service branch, rank, and gallantry badges are worn on the chest; insignia are worn on the shoulders with the compulsory flag-of-Pakistan patch.       |ACU|Combat_Uniforms|  and the  |ASU|Army_Service_Uniform| , 1994.

Within a few months of its founding in 1947, the military had inherited all professional qualifications of the British military in India.       In respect to the  |British_Indian_military|British_Indian_Army| , the  |Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry_Of_Defence_Pakistan|  authorised the three  |junior_commissioned_officer|Junior_Commissioned_Officer|  pay grades between the  |enlisted_ranks|Enlisted_Rank|  and  |commissioned_officers|Commissioned_Officers| .  The JCO grades are equivalent to the  |civil_bureaucracys_pay_scales|Types_Of_Government_Servants_In_Pakistan|  for those who rise by promotion from among enlisted recruits. The JCO grades in the Pakistani military are a continuation of the former  |Viceroy_of_Indias|Viceroy_Of_India|  commissioned pay grades during the  |British_colonial_period|British_Rule_Of_India| .  Promotion to the JCO, however, remains a lucrative and powerful incentive for the enlisted military personnel; thus, if JCO ranks are ever phased out, it will probably be a slow process.        Nishan-i-Haider  is the highest military decoration of Pakistan. It is awarded to those who have performed acts of greatest heroism or most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme danger and have shown bravery of the highest order or devotion to the country, in the presence of the enemy on land, at sea or in the air.  this award has been given to ten Pakistani servicemen who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.       Hilal-i-Jurat  is the second-highest military decoration of Pakistan, and the highest to be given to a living Pakistani  The award is conferrable on officers of the Army, Navy, or Air Force, for acts of valour, courage, or devotion to duty, performed on land, at sea, or in the air in the face of the enemy. Recipients have often received land and pensions, and could place the honorific HJ after their name.    Sitara-i-Jurat  is the third-highest military decoration of Pakistan, awarded for gallantry or distinguished service in combat, and can be bestowed upon officers, JCOs, and warrant officers of the Armed Forces including paramilitary forces under federal control. Recipients can place the honorific SJ after their name.    Tamgha-i-Jurat  is the fourth-highest military decoration of Pakistan, awarded for gallantry or distinguished service in combat. This is essentially the NCO and enlisted version of the Sitara-i-Jurat. Recipients can place the honorific TJ after their name.                 Chinas relationship with Pakistan holds great importance for both countries in terms of common interest and geopolitical strategy. The alliance was initially formed to counter the regional influence and military threat posed by India and the Soviet Union. In recent years the friendship has deepened further: China and Pakistan have signed several mutual-defence treaties.     China has been a steady source of  |military_equipment|Military_Equipment|  and has cooperated with Pakistan in setting-up weapons production and modernisation facilities.     The two countries are actively involved in several joint projects to enhance each others military needs, including development and production of the  |JF-17_Thunder|Jf-17_Thunder|  fighter jet, the  |K-8_Karakorum|Hongdu_Jl-8|  advanced training aircraft, the  |Al-Khalid_tank|Al-Khalid_Tank| ,  |airborne_early_warning_and_control|Airborne_Early_Warning_And_Control|  systems, and many other projects. The two countries have held several joint military exercises to enhance co-operation between their armed forces. China is also the largest investor in the  |Gwadar_Deep_Sea_Port|Gwadar_Port| , which is strategically located at the mouth of the  |Strait_of_Hormuz|Strait_Of_Hormuz| .            Prior to 1971, Pakistans military had a strong presence in  |East_Pakistan|East_Pakistan|  and an active  |theatre-level_military_command|Evolution_Of_Pakistan_Eastern_Command_Plan| . After Bangladeshs independence from Pakistan, full diplomatic relations were not restored until 1976.  Relations improved considerably under the Bangladesh military governments of President Major  |Ziaur_Rahman|Ziaur_Rahman|  and General  |Hossain_Mohammad_Ershad|Hossain_Mohammad_Ershad| , as Bangladesh had grown distant from its former war ally, India.  Common concerns over Indias regional power have influenced strategic co-operation, leading to a gift of several  |squadrons|Squadron|  of  |F-6_fighter_aircraft|Shenyang_J-6|  to the  |Bangladesh_Air_Force|Bangladesh_Air_Force|  in the late 1980s.      After being condemned by India, Great Britain, and the United States between 2004 and 2006 for repressing democracy, the  |Nepalese_monarchy|Nepalese_Monarchy|  developed military ties with China and Pakistan, who offered extensive support, arms, and equipment for the monarchys struggle to stay in power in the face of a  |Maoist_insurgency|Nepalese_Civil_War| .       When India proved reluctant to supply  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka|  with weapons, the insurgency-plagued island nation turned to Pakistan. In May 2000, with separatist  |Tamil_Tiger|Tamil_Tiger|  rebels about to recapture their former capital of  |Jaffna|Jaffna| , Pakistan President  |Musharraf|Musharraf|  provided millions of dollars of much-needed armament to the Sri Lankan government.  In May 2008, Lt-Gen Fonseka of the  |Sri_Lanka_Army|Sri_Lanka_Army|  held talks with his Pakistan Army counterparts regarding the sale of military equipment, weapons, and ammunition. The sale of 22  |Al-Khalid|Al-Khalid_Tank|  main battle tanks to the Sri Lanka Army was finalised during these talks, in a deal worth over US$100  million.  In April 2009, Sri Lanka requested $25  million worth of 81  mm, 120  mm and 130  mm mortar ammunition, to be delivered within a month, which proved decisive in the defeat of the Tamil Tigers.  . Thaindian.com . Retrieved 12 July 2013.               Throughout its history, Pakistan has had a fluctuating military relationship with the United States. During times of co-operation, US military funding and training have enhanced the Pakistan Armed Forces; in contrast, severing of US support at critical junctures has led to bitter disillusionment. These wide swings of fortune are something to which the Pakistanis have become accustomed, and they recognise that, whatever the provocation, the relationship with the United States has too much potential benefit to be discarded lightly.     In support of the United States  |2001_invasion_of_Afghanistan|Us_Attack_On_Afghanistan| , Pakistans armed forces received large amounts of military aid, funding, and training. According to  |Ministry_of_Finance|Ministry_Of_Finance|  calculations, in the three years prior to the  |11_September_attacks|September_11_Attacks| , Pakistan received approximately $9  million in American military aid; in the three years after, the amount increased to $4.2  billion.         Pakistan has maintained strong military-to-military relations with the  |28_member_states|Member_States_Of_Nato|  comprising the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  NATO regards its relations with Pakistan as partners across the globe. With the support of US Secretary of State  |Colin_Powell|Colin_Powell| , Pakistan was designated a  |major_non-NATO_ally|Major_Non-Nato_Ally|  in 2004.         Since the 2000s, military relations have improved between the Russian armed forces and the Pakistan armed forces.                 Pakistans close ties to the nations of the Middle East, based on geography and shared religion, have led to periodic military deployments since the 1960s. The  |Arab_world|Arab_World|  countries – many of them wealthy but with small populations and limited militaries – have historically depended on regional armies to provide a protective umbrella and military muscle in times of instability and crisis.  The Pakistani military has retained a particularly close relationship with  |Saudi_Arabia|Saudi_Arabia|  which has been a sporadically generous patron: much of the military equipment bought from the United States by Pakistan in the 1980s was paid for by Saudi Arabia. The  |United_Arab_Emirates|United_Arab_Emirates|  and  |Kuwait|Kuwait|  also have been important sources of financial support.      Pakistani military personnel have been posted as military advisers and instructors to the militaries of  |Saudi_Arabia|Military_Of_Saudi_Arabia| ,  |Jordan|Military_Of_Jordan| ,  |Syria|Military_Of_Syria| ,  |Libya|Military_Of_Libya| ,  |Kuwait|Military_Of_Kuwait| , and the  |UAE|Military_Of_United_Arab_Emirates| . Pakistan Air Force, Navy, and Army personnel played crucial roles in building the  |UAE_military|Military_Of_United_Arab_Emirates| . Many Arab military officials have been educated at Pakistans military staff colleges and universities. A combat division commanded by Major-General  |Zia-ul-Haq|Muhammad_Zia-Ul-Haq|  was instrumental in putting down the Palestinian  |Black_September|Black_September_In_Jordan|  revolt against King Hussein in  |Jordan|Jordan|  in the early 1970s.      Pakistan has enjoyed strong military co-operation with the  |Iranian_military|Military_Of_Iran|  since the 1950s. Iranian leader  |Mohammad_Reza_Shah|Mohammad_Reza_Shah|  provided free fuel to PAF fighter jets in the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1965| , allowing Pakistani planes to land at  |Iranian_Air_Force|Islamic_Republic_Of_Iran_Air_Force|  bases, refuel, and take off. The military relationship continued even after the  |Iranian_revolution|Iranian_Revolution| , as Pakistan was among the first countries to recognise the new Iranian government. In the aftermath of the  |hostage_crisis|Iran_Hostage_Crisis|  in  |Tehran|Tehran| , the United States severed its ties with Iran, leading Iran to send its military officers and personnel to be educated at Pakistani military academies. Relations became difficult following the  |Soviet–Afghan_War|Soviet–Afghan_War| , when hundreds of foreign fighters arrived in Pakistan to take part in the  |Afghan_Jihad|Afghan_Jihad| . Pakistan President  |Zia-ul-Haqs|Muhammad_Zia-Ul-Haq|  military administration policy reflected extremist views towards the  |Shiites|Shias|  and caused  |religious_tensions|Sectarianism_In_Pakistan|  to rise between  |Sunni|Sunni|  and Shiites in Pakistan, much to the discomfort of Iran. During the  |Iran–Iraq_War|Iran–Iraq_War| , the  |Arab_countries|Arab_World|  and the United States, who were  |supporting|International_Aid_To_Combatants_In_The_Iran–Iraq_War|  Iraq, pressured Pakistan to discontinue its covert support and military funding for Iran.     The 1980s were a difficult time in military relations for both countries, as Iran was blamed for the rising ethnic tensions between Sunnis and Shiites in Pakistan. The relationship further deteriorated in the 1990s when the  |Taliban|Afghan_Taliban| , with Pakistans support, began  |their_rule_of_Afghanistan|Islamic_Emirate_Of_Afghanistan| . In 1998, Iran and Afghanistan were on the verge of war over the  |assassination_of_Iranian_diplomats|1998_Iranian_Diplomats_Murder_In_Afghanistan| . Irans relations with India improved during this time, with both supporting the  |Northern_Alliance|Northern_Alliance|  against the Taliban.     The situation began to normalise in 2000, with Pakistan and Iran reinstating  |trade_relations|Iran–Pakistan_Trade_Relations| . In the wake of the  |11_September_attacks|September_11_Attacks|  in the United States and the fall of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, the two countries began rebuilding their military ties. Over the years, diplomatic delegations have been exchanged, and Pakistan has agreed to sell military equipment to Iran. In addition, Pakistan has maintained strong military-to-military ties with  |Turkey|Turkey| , and would like to use these, as well as its Iranian connections, as a bridge to the new Muslim states of Central Asia.               After the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1947| , recommendations for establishing an elite commando division within the army were accepted. Commissioned in 1956 with help from  |US_Army_Special_Forces|Us_Army_Special_Forces| , the Pakistan Armys  |Special_Services_Group|Special_Services_Group|  is an elite special operations division; its training and nature of operations are roughly equivalent to British  |Special_Air_Service|Special_Air_Service|  and US Army Special Forces and  |Delta_Force|Delta_Force| . Tentative estimates of the divisions size are put at four battalions but the actual strength is kept highly classified.     With the successful commissioning of Special Services Group, the Pakistan Navy accepted recommendations for commissioning its own special operational unit shortly after the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1965| .  Established as  |Special_Service_Group_Navy|Special_Service_Group_Navy|  in 1966, it is an elite and secretive commando division whose training and combat operations are similar to the Royal Navys  |Special_Boat_Service|Special_Boat_Service|  and US Navys  |Special_Warfare_Development_Group|U.S._Naval_Special_Warfare_Development_Group|  and Sea, Air, Land  teams. Operatives identities and actual static strength are kept secret and classified. Very few details of their missions are publicly known.     A small unit of  |Pakistan_Marines|Pakistan_Marines|  have, since 1990, operated reconnaissance units to deter the  |Indian_Armys|Indian_Army|  actions in the  |Sir_Creek|Sir_Creek|  region.   Other battalions of Marines are trained to carry out operations with airborne, heliborne, submarine, and waterborne insertions and extractions.      The  |Special_Service_Wing|Special_Service_Wing|  is the newest special operations commando division, established by the Pakistan Air Force in 2004, in the wake of challenges posed by the  |Afghanistan_war|War_In_Afghanistan| . The unit was active earlier and had seen action during the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1947| ,  |1965|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1965| , and  |1971|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1971| . The SSW is designed to execute difficult aerial and land operations, serving as equivalent to the US Air Forces  |Special_Tactics_Squadron|List_Of_United_States_Air_Force_Special_Operations_Squadronsspecial_Tactics_Squadrons|  units.  Following the secretive tradition of its counterparts in other services, the actual number of its serving personnel is kept classified.          In 2009, Pakistan was the single largest contributor of UN peacekeeping forces, with more than 11,000 Pakistani military personnel serving in UN peacekeeping operations worldwide.  . Al Jazeera. Retrieved 12 July 2013.     The table below shows the current deployment of Pakistani Forces in UN Peacekeeping missions.                     According to the views of Russian scholar  |Anatol_Lieven|Anatol_Lieven| , the Pakistan Armed Forces play a vital role in keeping the Pakistani state together, promoting a spirit of unity and nationhood, and providing a bastion of selfless service to the nation.  As an institution, the armed forces have been integrated into Pakistani civil society since the establishment of the country in 1947. The military has been involved in building much of the countrys infrastructure  and civil–military input from all sections of the armed forces has helped to build a stable society and professionalism in the armed forces.      In times of natural disasters such as  |floods|Pakistan_Flood|  and  |earthquakes|2005_Kashmir_Earthquake| , army engineers, medical and logistics personnel, and the armed forces generally have played a major role in rescue, relief, and supply efforts.  In 2010, armed forces personnel donated one day of salary for their flood-effected brethren.      In 1996, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, General  |Jehangir_Karamat|Jehangir_Karamat| , described the Pakistan Armed Forces relations with civilian society:           According to 2012 reports of the  |National_Reconstruction_Bureau|National_Reconstruction_Bureau|  , around 91.1% of civilian infrastructure in the  |Federally_Administered_Tribal_Area|Federally_Administered_Tribal_Area|  was built by the armed forces in a policy based on sustainable development plans, to improve the livelihood of ordinary people of the region.  According to Air Force statistics, the air force conducted approximately 693 relief operations in Pakistan and abroad during the fiscal period 1998–2008.  The Air Force carried and distributed thousands of tons of wheat, medicines, emergency shelters, and provided assistance to rehabilitate the disaster-effected areas of the country.      During the wave of  |floods|List_Of_Floods_In_Pakistan|  from 2010 to 2014, the Navy and Marines launched  |relief_operations|Operation_Madad|  nationwide and provided healthcare, medicines, relief efforts, and coordinated the distribution of food in the flood-effected areas.  In the Navys own admission, it had provided  of food and relief goods to flood victims; this included 5,700  kg of ready-to-cook food, 1,000  kg of dates and 5,000  kg of food dispatched to Sukkur. The Pakistan Naval Air Arm had air dropped more than 500  kg of food and relief goods in Thal, Ghospur, and Mirpur areas.      Engineering units of the Navy and Marines built more than 87 houses distributed to the local  |internally_displaced_persons|Internally_Displaced_Person|  . About 69,000 affected IDPs were treated in Navy and Marines medical camps.         The  Youm-e-Difa  – Pakistans day in remembrance of fallen soldiers of the  |Indo-Pakistani_war_of_1965|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1965|  – is observed on 6 September.  Memorial services are held in the presence of Pakistans top military and civil officials.  Wreaths of flowers are laid on the graves of the fallen soldiers and ceremonies are held across the country.  The change of guard ceremony takes place at  |Mazar-e-Quaid|Mazar-E-Quaid| , where the cadets of inter-services academies present Guard of Honour and take the charge. Additionally, the  Youm-e-Fizaya  is celebrated on 7 September, and the  Youm-e-Bahriya  on 8 September.      The Pakistan Armed Forces parades take place on 23 March, which is celebrated as  Youm-e-Pakistan  . All main service branches parade on  |Constitution_Avenue|Constitution_Avenue,_Islamabad|  in  |Islamabad|Islamabad| , where the weapon exhibitions are televised.                Pakistans development of  |nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapons|  began in 1972, following the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1971| , with the government adopting a  |policy_of_deliberate_ambiguity|Policy_Of_Deliberate_Ambiguity|  which was practised and observed from 1972 to 1998. Amid pressure built after  |Indias_nuclear_test|Pokhran-Ii|  in 1998, Pakistan successfully conducted its first publicly announced nuclear tests in 1998:  |Chagai-I|Chagai-I|  and  |Chagai-II|Chagai-Ii| . With these tests, Pakistan became the seventh nation to achieve the status of a nuclear power.      Under a public policy guidance, strategic weapons and projects are researched and developed entirely by civilian scientists and engineers, who also develop a wide range of delivery systems. On military policy issues, Pakistan issues directives towards  |first_use|Pre-Emptive_Nuclear_Strike|   and maintains that its  |program|Pakistan_And_Its_Nuclear_Deterrent_Program|  is based on  |nuclear_deterrence|Nuclear_Deterrence_Theory| , to peacefully discourage attack by India and other countries with large conventional-force advantages over Pakistan.  According to United States military sources, Pakistan has achieved survivability in a possible  |nuclear_conflict|Indo-Pakistani_Nuclear_Conflict|  through  |second_strike|Second_Strike_Capability|  capability.  Since the early 1990s, Pakistans nuclear strategists have emphasised attaining second strike capability in spite of their first use policy.  Statements and physical actions by Pakistan have cited the survivability through a second strike, forming a naval-based  |command_and_control|Command_And_Control|  system to serve as the custodian of the nations second-strike capability.      In January 2000, the head of United States Central Command, General  |Anthony_Zinni|Anthony_Zinni| , told  |NBC|Nbc|  that longtime assumptions that India had an edge in the South Asian strategic balance of power were questionable at best. Said Zinni: Dont assume that the Pakistanis nuclear capability is inferior to the Indians .      Despite international pressure, Pakistan has refused to sign either the  |Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty|Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty|  or the  |Comprehensive_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty|Comprehensive_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty| . Initiatives taken towards consolidating strategic infrastructure led to the establishment, in 2000, of the  |Nuclear_Command_Authority|Nuclear_Command_Authority|  , which oversees the policy, military control, development, and deployment of the countrys tactical and strategic nuclear arsenals. The command and control of the strategic arsenal are kept under an inter-service strategic command which reports directly at the  |Joint_staff_HQ|Joint_Staff_Headquarters| .     Since its establishment in 2000, the chairperson of the NCA has been the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The NCA supervises and forms a tight control of the strategic organisations related to the research and development in  |Weapons_of_Mass_Destruction|Weapons_Of_Mass_Destruction|  . Pakistan has an extremely strict  |command_and_control|Nuclear_Command_And_Control|  system over its strategic assets, which is based on  |C4ISTAR|Command_And_Control|  which is kept under the Air Force.  The Islamabad-based Strategic Force Organization has a three-tier system which forms by combining the  |Nuclear_Command_Authority|Nuclear_Command_Authority| ,  |Strategic_Plans_Division_Force|Strategic_Plans_Division_Force|  , and each of three Inter-Services strategic force commands. The SPDs own force called SPD Force is responsible for security of nuclear weapons while the strategic forces commands of the  |air_force|Air_Force_Strategic_Command| ,  |army|Army_Strategic_Forces_Command| , and  |navy|Naval_Strategic_Forces_Command|  exercise the deployments and eventual usage of the WMDs. However, the executive decisions, operational plannings, and controls over the WMDs remains vested with the NCA under the  |Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan|Prime_Minister_Of_Pakistan| .             |Inter-Services_Intelligence|Inter-Services_Intelligence|  is the premier intelligence service of Pakistan that is responsible for providing, managing, and co-ordinating  |military_intelligence|Military_Intelligence|  for the Pakistan Armed Forces. After an eminent intelligence failure in the  |Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947|Indo-Pakistani_War_Of_1947| , the ISI was established by Army Major-General  |R._Cawthome|Robert_Cawthome|  and Navy Commander  |S.M._Ahsan|Syed_Mohammad_Ahsan| , in a view to co-ordinate military intelligence from each major service branch and provide an inter-service intelligence estimate.  While intelligence operatives are recruited from each service, including civilians, the ISI has become very powerful and influential. Due to its wide range of intelligence operations and influence, the ISI has been criticised both internally and externally. The Director General for Inter-Services Intelligence is the head of the ISI and also the principal adviser to the Prime Minister and President of Pakistan; the ISI reports directly to the prime minister.     The Directorate of  |Military_Intelligence|Military_Intelligence_Of_Pakistan|  provides intelligence to the Army, while the other main branches are served by  |Naval_Intelligence|Naval_Intelligence_Of_Pakistan|  and  |Air_Intelligence|Air_Intelligence_Of_Pakistan| . The intelligence services in each branch are tasked with providing intelligence on foreign operations, performing counterintelligence operations, and identifying and eliminating sleeper cells, foreign agents and other anti-Pakistani elements within Pakistan. Additional functions involve monitoring high-level military and political leaders and safe-guarding critical military and non-military facilities. The director-generals of each intelligence branch are usually two-star officers.     Traditionally, the bulk of intelligence work and efforts in Pakistan has been carried out by the ISI, the  |Intelligence_Bureau|Intelligence_Bureau|  , and the  |Federal_Investigation_Agency|Federal_Investigation_Agency|  as well as the others in the  |Pakistani_intelligence_community|Pakistani_Intelligence_Community| . To provide better co-ordination and eliminate competition, the  |National_Intelligence_Directorate|National_Intelligence_Directorate|  was established in 2014.  The NID serves a similar purpose as the U.S.  |National_Intelligence_Estimate|National_Intelligence_Estimate| , providing statistical analysis and counter-insurgency recommendations at all levels of command.        The military academies are:      |Pakistan_Military_Academy|Pakistan_Military_Academy| |Pakistan_Air_Force_Academy|Pakistan_Air_Force_Academy| |Pakistan_Naval_Academy|Pakistan_Naval_Academy| |Pakistan_Maritime_Academy|Pakistan_Maritime_Academy|      There are also a number of engineering, professional, and  |higher_education|Higher_Education_In_Pakistan|  military institutes:      |National_Defence_University|National_Defence_University,_Islamabad| |Command_and_Staff_College|Command_And_Staff_College| |PAF_Air_War_College|Paf_Air_War_College| |Combat_Commanders_School|Paf_Base_Sargodha| |Pakistan_Naval_War_College|Pakistan_Navy_War_College| |Military_College_of_Engineering|Military_College_Of_Engineering| |College_of_Electrical_and_Mechanical_Engineering|College_Of_Electrical_And_Mechanical_Engineering| |Army_Medical_College|Army_Medical_College| |Military_College_of_Signals|Military_College_Of_Signals| |College_of_Aeronautical_Engineering|College_Of_Aeronautical_Engineering| |College_of_Flying_Training|College_Of_Flying_Training| |Pakistan_Navy_Engineering_College|Pakistan_Navy_Engineering_College| |Air_University|Air_University| |Fauji_University|Foundation_University,_Islamabad| |Bahria_University|Bahria_University|             Pakistans military justice system rests on the inter-services administrated  |Judge_Advocate_General_Branch|Judge_Advocate_General_Branch|  ; all military criminal cases are overseen by the high-ranking officials of joint tribunals of the military.  Each major service branch has its own service law:  |Army_Justice_Act|Pakistan_Army| , promulgated in 1952; the  |PAF_Justice_Act|Pakistan_Air_Force| , established in 1953; and the  |Navy_Ordinance|Pakistan_Navy| , enacted in 1961.  The identities of active-duty uniformed JAG officials are kept classified and no details of such individuals are made available to media.     All three sets of service laws are administered by the individual major service branches under the central reporting supervision of the  |Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry_Of_Defence|  . The army has a four-tier system; the air force, navy, and marines have a three-tier systems. The two top levels of all three-tier systems are the general court-martial and district court-martial; the third level comprises the field general court-martial in the army, air force, and navy. The fourth-level tier of the army comprises the summary court-martial. The differences in tier levels reflect whether their competence extends to officers or enlisted personnel, and the severity of the punishment that may be imposed.     Pakistans  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_Pakistan|  and the  |civilian_courts|Court_System_Of_Pakistan|  cannot question decisions handed down by the military judges, and double jeopardy is prohibited. In cases where a member of the military is alleged to have committed a crime against a civilian, then the MoD and  |Ministry_of_Justice|Ministry_Of_Justice|  determine the prosecution of the case to be tried, whether military or civilian courts have jurisdiction. Former servicemen in civilian life who are accused of felonies committed while on active duty are liable for prosecution under the jurisdiction of military courts. These courts are empowered to dispense a wide range of punishments including death. All sentences of imprisonment are served in military prisons or detention barracks.                 At the time of the creation of Pakistan, the country had virtually no military industry or production capability. In 1949–50, the contribution of the industrial sector to the  |GNP|Gross_National_Product|  was only 5.8%, of which 4.8% was attributed to small-scale industries. The new nations only major heavy-industry operation was the  |Karachi_Shipyard|Karachi_Shipyard|  and Engineering Works , which was focused on civil maritime construction. All military industrial materials and weapons systems were either inherited or purchased from the United Kingdom.      By 1951, Prime Minister  |Liaquat_Ali_Khan|Liaquat_Ali_Khan|  had established the  |Pakistan_Ordnance_Factory|Pakistan_Ordnance_Factory|  in  |Wah_Military_District|Wah_Cantonment| , with a civilian chemist, Dr.  |Abdul_Hafeez|Abdul_Hafeez| , serving as director and senior scientist. The POF was oriented towards the production of small arms, ammunition, and chemical explosives. During the period of reliance on United States supply, from 1955 to 1964, there was little attention given to domestic production. Almost all military weapons and equipment were provided by the United States, as part of Pakistans membership in  |South_East_Asian_Treaty_Organization|South_East_Asian_Treaty_Organization|  and  |Central_Treaty_Organization|Central_Treaty_Organization|  . By 1963, the  |Defence_Science_and_Technology_Organization|Defence_Science_And_Technology_Organization|  was formed by POF Director Hafeez for the purposes of military  |research_and_development|Research_And_Development| . After U.S. military assistance was cut off in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 , Pakistan turned to China for help in expanding its military industrial and production capabilities, including the modernisation of the facilities at Wah.          Faced with defence and security issues involving much larger opponents on both its eastern and western borders, the  |Ministry_of_Defence|Ministry_Of_Defence|  and  |Ministry_of_Finance|Ministry_Of_Finance|  require a disproportionate share of the nations resources to maintain even a  |minimally_effective|N-Deterrence|  defensive stance. Since 1971, the military budget of the armed forces grew by 200% in support of armed forces contingency operations. During the administrations of Prime Ministers  |Benazir_Bhutto|Benazir_Bhutto|  and  |Nawaz_Sharif|Nawaz_Sharif| , approximately 50–60% of scientific research and funding went to military efforts.     In 1993, Benazir Bhuttos defence budget for the year was set at  |P₨.|Pakistan_Rupee| 94  billion , which represented 27% of the governments circular spending and 8.9% of GDP, in calculations shown by the United States military. Despite criticism from the countrys influential political-science sphere,  the government increased the military budget by an additional 11% for the fiscal year 2015–16.                During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the  |US_Congress|Us_Congress|  scrutinised its  |military_aid_to_Pakistan|Foreign_Aid_To_Pakistan|  despite efforts by U.S. President  |Richard_Nixon|Richard_Nixon| . Burne, Lester H. Chronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations: 1932–1988. Routledge, 2003. . After the war, programs on self-reliance and domestic production were launched with the establishment of the  |Ministry_of_Defence_Production|Ministry_Of_Defence_Production|  in 1972, aiming to promote and co-ordinate the patchwork of military production facilities which had developed since independence. New military policy oversaw the establishment of  |Heavy_Industries_Taxila|Heavy_Industries_Taxila|  in  |Taxila|Taxila|  and the  |Pakistan_Aeronautical_Complex|Pakistan_Aeronautical_Complex|  in  |Kamra|Kamra| , north of  |Islamabad|Islamabad| . The militarisation of the  |Karachi_Shipyard|Karachi_Shipyard|  Engineering Works took place the same year. The PAC reverse-engineered several  |F–6J|Shenyang_F-6| ,  |F–7P|Chengdu_J-7| ,  |Mirage_III|Dassault_Mirage_Iii| , and  |Mirage_5|Dassault_Mirage_5|  fighter jets , built the  |Mushak|Mushak|  trainer , and maintained radar and avionics equipment. After the success of the Mushak, the Super Mushak and the state-of-art  |Karakoram-8|Hongdu_Jl-8|  advanced training jet were produced. The MoDP includes seven other specialised organizations devoted to research and development, production, and administration.      In 1987, the KSEW began developing submarine technology and rebuilding the  |submarine_base|Karachi_Naval_Dockyard|  near  |Port_Qasim|Port_Qasim| . In the 1990s, concerns over Pakistans secretive development of nuclear weapons led to the  |Pressler_amendment|Pressler_Amendment|   and an economic and military embargo. This caused a great panic in the Pakistan Armed Forces and each major service branch launched its own military-industrial programs.     By 1999, the KSEW had built its first long-range attack submarine, the  |Agosta_90B|Agosta-Class_Submarine| , which featured  |air-independent_propulsion|Air-Independent_Propulsion|  technology purchased from France in 1995. By early 2000, a joint venture with China led to the introduction of the  |JF-17|Jf-17_Thunder|  fighter jet and the  |Al-Khalid_main_battle_tank|Al-Khalid_Tank| , built and assembled at HIT. Since 2001, Pakistan has taken major steps toward becoming self-sufficient in aircraft overhaul and modernisation and tank and helicopter sales.     After the success of its major projects in the defence industry, the  |Defence_Export_Promotion_Organization|Defence_Export_Promotion_Organization|  was created to promote Pakistani defence equipment to the world by hosting the  |International_Defence_Exhibition_and_Seminar|International_Defence_Exhibition_And_Seminar|  , which is held biennially at the Karachi expo center. Pakistans defence exports were reportedly worth over US$200  million in 2006, and have continued to grow since.  . Daily Times . Retrieved 12 July 2013.                    After the  |partitioning_of_India|Partition_Of_India|  in 1947, the Pakistan Army was formed by  |Indian_Muslim|Indian_Muslim|  officers serving in the  |British_Indian_Army|British_Indian_Army| .  The largest branch of the nations military, it is a professional, volunteer fighting force, with about 550,000 active personnel and 500,000 reserves .   Although, the Constitution provides a basis for the  |service_draft|Military_Draft| , conscription has never been imposed in Pakistan.  A single command structure known as  |General_Headquarters|General_Headquarters|  is based at  |Rawalpindi_Cantt|Rawalpindi_Cantonment| , adjacent to the  |Joint_staff_HQ|Joint_Staff_Headquarters| . The army is commanded by the  |Chief_of_Army_Staff|Chief_Of_Army_Staff|  , by statute a four-star army general, appointed by the president with the consultation and confirmation of the prime minister.   General  |Qamar_Javed_Bajwa|Qamar_Javed_Bajwa|  was the chief of army staff.   Army General  |Zubair_Mahmood_Hayat|Zubair_Mahmood_Hayat|  is the current chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.  The army has a wide range of corporate , commercial , and political interests, and on many occasions has  |seized_control|Military_Coups_In_Pakistan|  of the  |civilian_government|Government_Of_Pakistan|  to restore order in the country.      The  |Army_Aviation_Corps|Pakistan_Army_Aviation_Corps|  reportedly operates about 250 aircraft, including 40  |AH-1_Cobra|Ah-1_Cobra|  combat helicopters. The  |Army_Strategic_Forces_Command|Army_Strategic_Forces_Command|  operates a wide range of missile systems in its arsenal.  In spite of the  |Pressler_amendment|Pressler_Amendment|  enforced in the 1990s, the army has been focused on development of land-based weapon systems and production of military hardware.  Domestic innovation resulted in the successful development of  |G3A3|Heckler_&_Koch_Mp5|  rifles,  |Anza_missile|Anza|  systems, and  |Al-Zarrar|Al-Zarrar|  and  |Al-Khalid|Al-Khalid_Tank| |main_battle_tanks|Main_Battle_Tank|  .     Since 1947, the army has waged  |three_wars|Indo-Pakistani_Wars_And_Conflicts|  with neighbouring India, and several  |border_skirmishes_with_Afghanistan|Afghanistan–Pakistan_Skirmishes| .  Due to  |Pakistans_diverse_geography|Geography_Of_Pakistan| , the army has extensive combat experience in a variety of terrains.  The army has maintained a strong presence in the  |Arab_world|Arab_World|  during the  |Arab–Israeli_Wars|Arab–Israeli_Conflict| , aided the  |Coalition_Forces|Coalition_Of_The_Gulf_War|  in the first  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| , and played a major role in combat in the  |Bosnian_war|Bosnian_War|  as well as rescuing trapped American soldiers in  |Mogadishu|Mogadishu| ,  |Somalia|Somalia|  in 1993. Recently, major joint-operations undertaken by the army include  |Operation_Black_Thunderstorm|Operation_Black_Thunderstorm|  and  |Operation_Rah-e-Nijat|Operation_Rah-E-Nijat| , against armed insurgents within Pakistan. The army has also been an active participant in  |UN_peacekeeping_missions|United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Missions_Involving_Pakistan| .           Brought into existence in 1947 with the establishment of the  |Pakistan_Air_Force_Academy|Pakistan_Air_Force_Academy| , the Pakistan Air Force is regarded as a powerful defence component of the countrys defence.  The prefix Royal was added in 1947, but dropped when Pakistan became an  |Islamic_republic|Constitution_Of_Pakistan_Of_1956|  in 1956.  The PAF is the seventh-largest air force and the largest in the  |Islamic_world|Islamic_World| , with about 943 combat fighter jets and over 200 trainer, transport, communication, helicopter, and force-multiplier aircraft. A single command structure  |Air_Headquarters|Air_Headquarters|  is based at  |Rawalpindi_Cantt|Rawalpindi_Cantonment| , adjacent to the  |Joint_staff_HQ|Joint_Staff_Headquarters| . The air force is commanded by the  |Chief_of_Air_Staff|Chief_Of_Air_Staff|  , by statute a four-star air chief marshal, appointed by the president, with the consultation and confirmation of the prime minister. As of current appointment, Air Chief Marshal  |Sohail_Aman|Sohail_Aman|  is the CAS.      In many important events in Pakistans history, the air force has played a pivotal, influential, and crucial role in the nations defence and national security, and promoted a sense of security in civil society.     Its military significance and importance in public perception contribute to the PAFs dominance over the other major service branches.  The PAF officially uses the slogan: Second to None; fully abreast with the requisite will and mechanism to live by its standards in the coming millennium and beyond.         Historically, the air force has been heavily dependent on U.S., Chinese, and French aircraft technology to support its growth, despite impositions of the Pressler amendment. While  |F-16s|F-16_Falcon|  continue to be a backbone of the air force,  the local development and quick production of the  |JF-17|Jf-17_Thunder|  have provided an alternative route to meet its aerial combat requirements.  According to PAF accounts, the air force plans to retire several of its ageing French-licensed  |Mirage_III|Dassault_Mirage_Iii|  and  |Mirage_5|Dassault_Mirage_5|  fighter jets.         Joint production with the  |Chinese_Air_Force|Peoples_Liberation_Army_Air_Force|  of a light-weight  |multi-role_combat_aircraft|Multirole_Combat_Aircraft|  and further avionics development of the JF-17 is ongoing at the  |Pakistan_Aeronautical_Complex|Pakistan_Aeronautical_Complex|  . As of 2016, 70 JF-17s are operational and have replaced 50 Mirage IIIs and F-7Ps. The PAF plans to replace all F-7Ps and Mirage III/5 aircraft by 2020.    The F-7PG will be replaced later, and the JF-17 fleet may eventually be expanded to 300 aircraft.   Realizing the importance of  |fifth_generation_fighter_aircraft|Fifth_Generation_Fighter_Aircraft| , the PAF successfully negotiated for the procurement of approximately 36 Chinese  |FC-20|Chengdu_J-10|  fighter jets – a deal worth around US$1.4  billion, signed in 2009.   It was expected that the FC-20s would be delivered in 2015.  In close co-ordination with  |Turkish_Aerospace_Industries|Turkish_Aerospace_Industries| , the PAC engaged in a mid-life update program of its  |F-16|F-16| A/Bs, approximately 26 of which are in service.  In 2010, the air force procured at least 18 newly-built  |F-16|F-16| C/D Block 52s under the Peace Gate-II by the United States.
