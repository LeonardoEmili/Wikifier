       Hong Kong , a  |Special_Administrative_Region|Special_Administrative_Region|  of the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|China| , can be geographically divided into three territories:  |Kowloon|Kowloon| ,  |Hong_Kong_Island|Hong_Kong_Island| , and the  |New_Territories|New_Territories| . Hong Kong is a coastal city and major port in  |Southern_China|South_China| , bordering  |Guangdong_province|Guangdong|  through city of  |Shenzhen|Shenzhen|  to the north and the  |South_China_Sea|South_China_Sea|  to the West, East and South. Hong Kong and its 260 territorial islands and peninsulas are located at the mouth of the  |Pearl_River_Delta|Pearl_River_Delta| . The area of Hong Kong is distinct from  |Mainland_China|Mainland_China| , but is considered part of  |Greater_China|Greater_China|  .     Hong Kong has a total area of , of which 3.16% is water. 60 islands are dispersed around Hong Kong, the largest of which by area is  |Lantau_Island|Lantau_Island| , located Southwest of the main peninsula. Lantau Island and the majority of the remaining islands are part of the  |New_Territories|New_Territories| , an area that also encompasses the hilly terrain north of  |Kowloon|Kowloon| . Hong Kong Island is separated from Kowloon by  |Victoria_Harbour|Victoria_Harbour| , a natural landform harbour. The Kowloon Peninsula to the south of  |Boundary_Street|Boundary_Street|  and the New Territories to the north of Hong Kong Island were added to  |Colonial_Hong_Kong|Colonial_Hong_Kong|  in 1860 and 1898 respectively.     Further from Victoria Harbour and the coast, the landscape of Hong Kong is fairly hilly to mountainous with steep slopes. The highest point in the territory is  |Tai_Mo_Shan|Tai_Mo_Shan| , at a height of 958 metres in the New Territories.  . The World Factbook. CIA. Retrieved 18 September 2009. Lowlands exist in the northwestern part of the New Territories. Portions of land in the New Territories and Hong Kong island are reserved as country parks and nature reserves.     With the  |fourth_highest_population_density_of_countries_and_dependencies|Countries_By_Population_Density|  in the world at 6,300 people per square kilometer, Hong Kong is known for its shortage of residential space. Hong Kong has undergone several land reclamation projects to provide more space for residential and economical purposes, increasing its land area. This has caused the distance between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon to decrease.  |Hong_Kong_International_Airport|Hong_Kong_International_Airport|  is the sole public airport in the territory, and is mostly located on reclaimed land on the island of  |Chep_Lap_Kok|Chek_Lap_Kok| .     Politically, Hong Kong is divided into 18  |districts|Districts_Of_Hong_Kong| , each having a district council. Nevertheless, most public services operate across the territory, and travel between the districts is not restricted.  |Sha_Tin|Sha_Tin|  is the most populous district as of 2019.     The name  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong|  , literally meaning fragrant harbour , is derived from the area around present-day  |Aberdeen|Aberdeen,_Hong_Kong|  on Hong Kong Island, where fragrant wood products and incense were once traded.  , University of Hong Kong English Centre. The narrow body of water separating Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula,  |Victoria_Harbour|Victoria_Harbour| , is one of the deepest natural maritime  |ports|Port|  in the world.

It is not uncommon for temperatures to drop below  in urban areas. Sub-zero temperatures and  |frost|Frost|  occur at times on high ground and in the New Territories. March and April can be pleasant although there are occasional spells of high humidity.  |Fog|Fog|  and  |drizzle|Drizzle|  are common on high ground which is exposed to the southeast. May to August are hot and humid with occasional  |showers|Shower|  and  |thunderstorms|Thunderstorm| .

The natural resources of Hong Kong can be divided into three main categories:     Metalliferous minerals and non-metalliferous industrial minerals in the onshore area;   Quarried rock and building stone;   Offshore sand deposits.     Despite its small size, Hong Kong has a relatively large number of mineral occurrences. Some mineral deposits have been exploited commercially. Metalliferous mineral occurrences are grouped into four broad categories:  |tin|Tin| - |tungsten|Tungsten| - |molybdenum|Molybdenum|  mineralisation,  |copper|Copper| - |lead|Lead| - |zinc|Zinc|  mineralisation,  |iron|Iron|  mineralisation and placer deposits of  |tin|Tin|  and  |gold|Gold| .  |Mesozoic|Mesozoic|  igneous activity is largely responsible for this diversity of mineral deposits and the mineral concentrations have been variably enhanced by hydrothermal activity associated with faulting. Concentrations of non-metalliferous minerals that have been commercially exploited include  |kaolin_clay|Kaolin_Clay| ,  |feldspar|Feldspar| ,  |quartz|Quartz| ,  |beryl|Beryl|  and  |graphite|Graphite| .      For many years,  |granite|Granite|  and  |volcanic_rocks|Volcanic_Rocks|  have been quarried locally for road base metal, riprap, armour stone and asphalt, although the main purpose now is for concrete  |aggregates|Construction_Aggregate| . At present, there are three quarries operating in Hong Kong. These are principally in granite and are located at  |Lam_Tei|Lam_Tei| ,  |Shek_O|Shek_O|  and  |Anderson_Road|Anderson_Road,_Hong_Kong| . All the quarries are in the process of rehabilitation and have a life expectancy of between two and eight years.     Offshore sand bodies have been dredged for aggregate sand and reclamation fill in Hong Kong as the rate of urban development has increased.
