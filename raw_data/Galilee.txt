              Galilee  is a region in northern  |Israel|Israel| . The term Galilee traditionally refers to the mountainous part, divided into  |Upper_Galilee|Upper_Galilee|   and  |Lower_Galilee|Lower_Galilee|  .     In modern, common usage, Galilee refers to all of the area that is beyond  |Mount_Carmel|Mount_Carmel|  to the northeast, extending from  |Dan|Dan|  to the north, at the base of  |Mount_Hermon|Mount_Hermon| , along  |Mount_Lebanon|Mount_Lebanon|  to the ridges of  |Mount_Carmel|Mount_Carmel|  and  |Mount_Gilboa|Mount_Gilboa|  north of  |Jenin|Jenin|  to the south, and from the  |Jordan_Rift_Valley|Jordan_Valley|  to the east across the plains of the  |Jezreel_Valley|Jezreel_Valley|  and  |Acre|Acre_Israel|  to the shores of the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea|  and the  |coastal_plain|Coastal_Plain|  in the west, including  |Beth_Sheans|Beth_Shean|  valley,  |Sea_of_Galilees_valley|Sea_Of_Galilee| , and  |Hula_Valley|Hula_Valley| , although it usually does not include  |Haifas|Haifa|  immediate northern suburbs.     By this definition it overlaps with much of the administrative  |Northern_District|Northern_District|  of the country . Western Galilee  is a common term referring to the western part of the Upper Galilee and its shore, and usually also the northwestern part of the Lower Galilee, mostly overlapping with Acre sub district.  |Galilee_Panhandle|Galilee_Panhandle|  is a common term referring to the panhandle in the east that extends to the north, where Lebanon is to the west, and includes  |Hula_Valley|Hula_Valley|  and  |Ramot_Naftali|Ramot_Naftali|  mountains of the Upper Galilee. Historically, the part of  |Southern_Lebanon|Southern_Lebanon|  south of the east-west section of the  |Litani_River|Litani_River|  also belonged to the region of Galilee, but the present article mainly deals with the Israeli part of the region.       The regions Israelite name is from the  |Hebrew_root|Hebrew_Root|  גָּלִיל , an ultimately unique word for district, and usually cylinder. The Hebrew form used in  |Isaiah|Book_Of_Isaiah|  8:23 is in the  |construct_state|Construct_State| ,  , meaning Galilee of the nations, i.e. the part of Galilee inhabited by  |Gentiles|Gentile|  at the time that the book was written.     The region in turn gave rise to the English name for the Sea of Galilee referred to as such in many languages including ancient Arabic. In the Hebrew language, the lake is referred to as  , from Hebrew  ;  |Lake_of_Gennesaret|Lake_Of_Gennesaret|  , from , from   and either   or  , which may have been a reference to  |Nazareth|Nazareth|  town; and alternatively named the  |Sea_of_Tiberias|Sea_Of_Tiberias|  , from the town of  |Tiberias|Tiberias|  at its southwestern end, itself named after the first-century CE Roman emperor  |Tiberius|Tiberius| . These are the three names used in originally internal Jewish-authored literature rather than the Sea of Galilee .  However, Jews did use the Galilee to refer to the whole region , including its lake.       Most of Galilee consists of rocky terrain, at heights of between 500 and 700  m. Several high mountains are in the region, including  |Mount_Tabor|Mount_Tabor|  and  |Mount_Meron|Mount_Meron| , which have relatively low temperatures and high rainfall. As a result of this climate,  |flora|Flora|  and  |fauna|Fauna|  thrive in the region, while many birds annually migrate from colder climates to Africa and back through the  |Hula|Hula_Valley| –Jordan corridor. The streams and waterfalls, the latter mainly in Upper Galilee, along with vast fields of greenery and colourful wildflowers, as well as numerous towns of  |biblical|Biblical|  importance, make the region a popular  |tourist_destination|Tourism_In_Israel| .     Due to its high rainfall –, mild temperatures and high mountains , the upper Galilee region contains some distinctive flora and fauna: prickly juniper , Lebanese cedar , which grows in a small grove on Mount Meron,  |cyclamens|Cyclamen| ,  |paeonias|Peony| , and  Rhododendron ponticum  which sometimes appears on Meron.                According to the  |Bible|Bible| , Galilee was named by the Israelites and was the tribal region of Naphthali and Dan, at times overlapping the  |Tribe_of_Ashers|Tribe_Of_Asher|  land.  However, Dan was dispersed among the whole people rather than isolated to the lands of Dan, as the Tribe of Dan was the hereditary local law enforcement and judiciary for the whole nation. Gen. 49:16 earliest reference among others  Normally, Galilee is just referred to as Naphthali.     Chapter 9 of  |1_Kings|1_Kings|  states that  |Solomon|Solomon|  rewarded his  |Phoenicia|Phoenicia| n ally,  |King_Hiram_I|King_Hiram_I|  of  |Sidon|Sidon| , with twenty cities in the land of Galilee, which would then have been either settled by foreigners during and after the reign of Hiram, or by those who had been forcibly deported there by later conquerors such as the  |Assyria|Assyria| ns. Hiram, to reciprocate previous gifts given to  |David|David| , accepted the upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali and renamed it the land of  |Cabul|Cabul|  for a time. History of Phoenicia, by George Rawlinson 1889, Phoenicia under the hegemony of Tyre            During the expansion under the  |Hasmonean_dynasty|Hasmonean_Dynasty|  much of the Galilee region was conquered and annexed by the first Hasmonean King of Judaea  |Aristobulus_I|Aristobulus_I|  . Galilee in the first century was dotted with small towns and villages.  The Jewish historian  |Josephus|Josephus|  claims that there were 204 small towns in Galilee, but modern scholars believe this estimate to be an exaggeration. Many of these towns were located around the Sea of Galilee, which contained many edible fish and which was surrounded by fertile land. Salted, dried, and pickled fish were an important  |export_good|Export_Good| . In 4 BCE, a rebel named Judah plundered Galilees largest city,  |Sepphoris|Sepphoris| . In response, the Syrian governor  |Publius_Quinctilius_Varus|Publius_Quinctilius_Varus|  sacked Sepphoris and sold the population into slavery.     After the death of  |Herod_the_Great|Herod_The_Great|  that same year, the Roman emperor  |Augustus|Augustus|  appointed his son  |Herod_Antipas|Herod_Antipas|  as  |tetrarch_of_Galilee|Herodian_Tetrarchy| , which remained a Roman  |client_state|Client_State| .  Antipas paid tribute to the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  in exchange for Roman protection. The Romans did not station troops in Galilee, but threatened to retaliate against anyone who attacked it. As long as he continued to pay tribute, Antipas was permitted to govern however he wished and was permitted to mint his own coinage. Antipas was relatively observant of Jewish laws and customs. Although his palace was decorated with animal carvings, which many Jews regarded as a transgression against the law prohibiting idols, his coins bore only agricultural designs, which his subjects deemed acceptable.          In general, Antipas was a capable ruler; Josephus does not record any instance of him using force to put down an uprising and he had a long, prosperous reign. However, many Jews probably resented him as not sufficiently devout. Antipas rebuilt the city of Sepphoris and, in either 18 CE or 19 CE, he founded the new city of  |Tiberias|Tiberias| . These two cities became Galilees largest cultural centers. They were the main centers of Greco-Roman influence, but were still predominantly Jewish. A massive gap existed between the rich and poor, but lack of uprisings suggest that taxes were not exorbitantly high and that most Galileans did not feel their livelihoods were being threatened.     The archaeological discoveries of synagogues from the Hellenistic and Roman period in the Galilee show strong Phoenician influences, and a high level of tolerance for other cultures relative to other Jewish religious centers.  Late in his reign, Antipas married his half-niece  |Herodias|Herodias| , who was already married to one of her other uncles. His wife, whom he divorced, fled to her father  |Aretas|Aretas_Iv_Philopatris| , an Arab king, who invaded Galilee and defeated Antipass troops before withdrawing. Both Josephus and the  |Gospel_of_Mark|Gospel_Of_Mark|   record that the itinerate preacher  |John_the_Baptist|John_The_Baptist|  criticized Antipas over his marriage and Antipas consequently had him imprisoned and then  |beheaded|Beheading_Of_John_The_Baptist| .     In around 39 CE, at the urging of  |Herodias|Herodias| , Antipas went to Rome to request that he be elevated from the status of tetrarch to the status of king. The Romans found him guilty of storing arms, so he was removed from power and exiled, ending his forty-three-year reign. During the  |Great_Revolt|First_Jewish–Roman_War|  , a Jewish mob destroyed Herod Antipass palace. According to medieval Hebrew legend,  |Simeon_bar_Yochai|Simeon_Bar_Yochai| , one of the most famed of all the Tannaim, wrote the  |Zohar|Zohar|  while living in Galilee.  Eastern Galilee retained a Jewish majority until at least the seventh century.        After the  |Arab|Arab|  caliphate took control of the region in 638, it became part of  |Jund_al_Urdunn|Jund_Al_Urdunn|  . Its major towns were Tiberias ,  |Baysan|Baysan| ,  |Acre|Acre_Israel| ,  |Saffuriya|Saffuriya| , and  |Kabul|Kabul_Israel| .

The  |Shia|Shia_Islam| |Fatimids|Fatimid|  conquered the region in the 10th century; a breakaway sect, venerating the Fatimid caliph  |al_Hakim|Hakim| , formed the  |Druze|Druze|  religion, centered in Mount Lebanon and partially Galilee. During the  |Crusades|Crusade| , Galilee was organized into the  |Principality_of_Galilee|Principality_Of_Galilee| , one of the most important Crusader seigneuries.          During Early Ottoman era, the Galilee was governed as the  |Safad_Sanjak|Safad_Sanjak| , initially part of the larger administrative unit of  |Damascus_Eyalet|Damascus_Eyalet|  and later as part of  |Sidon_Eyalet|Sidon_Eyalet|  . During the 18th century, the administrative division of Galilee was renamed to  |Acre_Sanjak|Acre_Sanjak| , and the Eyalet itself became centered in Acre, factually becoming the Acre Eyalet between 1775 and 1841.     The Jewish population of Galilee increased significantly following  |their_expulsion_from_Spain|Alhambra_Decree|  and welcome from the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| . The community for a time made  |Safed|Safed|  an international center of cloth weaving and manufacturing, as well as a key site for Jewish learning.  Today it remains one of Judaisms  |four_holy_cities|Four_Holy_Cities|  and a center for  |kabbalah|Kabbalah| .     In the mid-17th century Galilee and Mount Lebanon became the scene of the  |Druze_power_struggle|Druze_Power_Struggle| , which came in parallel with much destruction in the region and decline of major cities.     In the mid-18th century, Galilee was caught up in a struggle between the  |Arab|Arab|  leader  |Zahir_al_Umar|Zahir_Al_Umar|  and the  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  authorities who were centred in  |Damascus|Damascus| . Zahir ruled Galilee for 25 years until Ottoman loyalist  |Jezzar_Pasha|Jezzar_Pasha|  conquered the region in 1775.     In 1831, the Galilee, a part of  |Ottoman_Syria|Ottoman_Syria| , switched hands from Ottomans to  |Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt|Ibrahim_Pasha_Of_Egypt|  until 1840. During this period, aggressive social and politic policies were introduced, which led to a violent  |1834_Arab_revolt|Syrian_Peasant_Revolt| . In the process of this revolt the Jewish community of  |Safed|Safed|  was greatly reduced, in the event of  |Safed_Plunder|Safed_Plunder|  by the rebels. The Arab rebels were subsequently defeated by the Egyptian troops, though in 1838, the Druze of Galilee led another  |uprising|1838_Druze_Rebellion| . In 1834 and  |1837|Galilee_Earthquake_Of_1837| , major earthquakes leveled most of the towns, resulting in great loss of life.     Following the 1864 Tanszimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, the Galilee remained within  |Acre_Sanjak|Acre_Sanjak| , but was transferred from  |Sidon_Eyalet|Sidon_Eyalet|  to the newly formed  |Syria_Vilayet|Syria_Vilayet|  and shortly, from 1888, became administered from  |Beirut_Vilayet|Beirut_Vilayet| .     In 1866, Galilees first hospital,  |the_Nazareth_Hospital|The_Nazareth_Hospital| , was founded under the leadership of American-Armenian missionary Dr.  |Kaloost_Vartan|Kaloost_Vartan| , assisted by German missionary  |John_Zeller|John_Zeller| .          In the early 20th century, Galilee remained part of  |Acre_Sanjak|Acre_Sanjak|  of Ottoman Syria. It was administered as the southernmost territory of the  |Beirut_Vilayet|Beirut_Vilayet| .       Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , and the  |Armistice_of_Mudros|Armistice_Of_Mudros| , it came under British rule, as part of the  |Occupied_Enemy_Territory_Administration|Occupied_Enemy_Territory_Administration| . Shortly after, in 1920, the region was included in the British Mandate territory, officially a part of Mandatory Palestine from 1923.       After the  |1948_Arab–Israeli_war|1948_Arab–Israeli_War| , nearly the whole of Galilee came under Israels control. A large portion of the population fled or was forced to leave, leaving dozens of entire villages empty; however, a large  |Israeli_Arab|Arab_Citizens_Of_Israel|  community remained based in and near the cities of Nazareth,  |Acre|Acre_Israel| ,  |Tamra|Tamra| ,  |Sakhnin|Sakhnin| , and  |Shefa_Amr|Shefa_Amr| , due to some extent to a successful rapprochement with the Druze. The  |kibbutz|Kibbutz| im around the  |Sea_of_Galilee|Sea_Of_Galilee|  were sometimes shelled by the  |Syrian_armys|Syrian_Army|  artillery until Israel seized Western  |Golan_Heights|Golan_Heights|  in the 1967  |Six_Day_War|Six_Day_War| .     During the 1970s and the early 1980s, the  |Palestine_Liberation_Organization|Palestine_Liberation_Organization| |_launched_multiple_attacks|Palestinian_Insurgency_In_South_Lebanon|  on towns and villages of the Upper and Western Galilee from  |Lebanon|Lebanon| . This came in parallel to the general destabilization of  |Southern_Lebanon|Southern_Lebanon| , which became a scene of fierce sectarian fighting which deteriorated into the  |Lebanese_Civil_War|Lebanese_Civil_War| . On the course of the war, Israel initiated  |Operation_Litani|Operation_Litani|  and  |Operation_Peace_For_Galilee|Operation_Peace_For_Galilee|  with the stated objectives of destroying the PLO infrastructure in Lebanon, protecting the citizens of the Galilee and supporting allied Christian Lebanese militias. Israel took over much of southern Lebanon in support of Christian Lebanese militias until 1985, when it withdrew to a  |narrow_security_buffer_zone|Israeli_Occupation_Of_Southern_Lebanon| .     From 1985 to 2000,  |Hezbollah|Hezbollah| , and earlier  |Amal|Amal_Movement| ,  |engaged|South_Lebanon_Conflict|  the  |South_Lebanon_Army|South_Lebanon_Army|  supported by the  |Israel_Defense_Forces|Israel_Defense_Forces| , sometimes shelling  |Upper_Galilee|Upper_Galilee|  communities with  |Katyusha|Katyusha_Rocket_Launcher|  rockets. In May 2000,  |Israeli_prime_minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Israel| |_Ehud_Barak|Ehud_Barak|  unilaterally withdrew IDF troops from southern Lebanon, maintaining a security force on the  |Israeli_side_of_the_international_border|Blue_Line|  recognized by the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| . The move brought a collapse to the  |South_Lebanon_Army|South_Lebanon_Army|  and takeover of Southern Lebanon by Hezbollah. However, despite Israeli withdrawal, clashes between Hezbollah and Israel continued along the border, and UN observers condemned both for their attacks.     The  |2006_Israel_Lebanon_conflict|2006_Israel_Lebanon_Conflict|  was characterized by round-the-clock Katyusha rocket attacks by Hezbollah on the whole of Galilee, with long-range, ground-launched missiles hitting as far south as the  |Sharon_Plain|Sharon_Plain| ,  |Jezreel_Valley|Jezreel_Valley| , and  |Jordan_Valley|Jordan_Valley|  below the Sea of Galilee.                  , there were 1.2  million residents in Galilee, of which 47% were Jewish.  The  |Jewish_Agency|Jewish_Agency|  has attempted to  |increase_the_Jewish_population|Judaization_Of_The_Galilee|  in this area,  but the non-Jewish population also has a high growth rate.     The largest cities in the region are Acre, Nahariya, Nazareth, Safed,  |Karmiel|Karmiel| ,  |Shaghur|Shaghur| ,  |Shefa_Amr|Shefa_Amr| ,  |Afula|Afula| , and Tiberias.  The port city of  |Haifa|Haifa|  serves as a commercial center for the whole region.     Because of its hilly terrain, most of the people in the Galilee live in small villages connected by relatively few roads.  A railroad runs south from  |Nahariya|Nahariya|  along the  |Mediterranean_coast|Mediterranean_Sea| , and a fork to the east is due to operate in 2015. The main sources of livelihood throughout the area are agriculture and tourism.  |Industrial_parks|Industrial_Park|  are being developed, bringing further employment opportunities to the local population which includes many recent immigrants. The Israeli government is contributing funding to the private initiative, the Galilee Finance Facility, organised by the  |Milken_Institute|Milken_Institute|  and  |Koret_Economic_Development_Fund|Koret_Economic_Development_Fund| .      The Galilee is home to a large  |Arab|Arab_Citizens_Of_Israel|  population,   comprising a Muslim majority and two smaller populations, of  |Druze|Israeli_Druze|  and  |Arab_Christians|Arab_Christians| , of comparable sizes. Both Israeli Druze and Christians have their majorities in the Galilee.   Other notable minorities are the Bedouin, the  |Maronites|Maronites_In_Israel|  and the  |Circassians|Circassians_In_Israel| .     The north-central portion of the Galilee is also known as Central Galilee, stretching from the border with  |Lebanon|Lebanon|  to the northern edge of the Jezreel Valley, including the cities of Nazareth and Sakhnin, has an Arab majority of 75% with most of the Jewish population living in hilltop cities like  |Upper_Nazareth|Upper_Nazareth| . The northern half of the central Lower Galilee, surrounding  |Karmiel|Karmiel|  and  |Sakhnin|Sakhnin|  is known as the Heart of the Galilee . The eastern Galilee is nearly 100% Jewish. This part includes the  |Finger_of_the_Galilee|Finger_Of_The_Galilee| , the Jordan River Valley, and the shores the Sea of Galilee, and contains two of Judaisms  |Four_Holy_Cities|Four_Holy_Cities| . The southern part of the Galilee, including Jezreel Valley, and the  |Gilboa|Mount_Gilboa|  region are also nearly 100% Jewish, with a few small Arab villages near the  |West_Bank|West_Bank|  border. About 80% of the population of the Western Galilee is Jewish, all the way up to the Lebanese border. Jews also form a small majority in the mountainous  |Upper_Galilee|Upper_Galilee|  with a significant minority Arab population .     As of 2011, the Galilee is attracting significant internal migration of  |Haredi_Jews|Haredi_Judaism| , who are increasingly moving to the Galilee and Negev as an answer to rising housing prices in central Israel.           Galilee is a popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy its scenic, recreational, and gastronomic offerings. The Galilee attracts many  |Christian_pilgrims|Christian_Pilgrimage| , as many of the  |miracles_of_Jesus|Miracles_Of_Jesus|  occurred, according to the  |New_Testament|New_Testament| , on the shores of the Sea of Galilee—including  |his_walking_on_water|Jesus_Walks_On_Water| ,  |calming_the_storm|Calming_The_Storm| , and  |feeding_five_thousand_people|Feeding_The_Multitude|  in  |Tabgha|Tabgha| . In addition, numerous sites of  |biblical|Biblical|  importance are located in the Galilee, such as  |Megiddo|Tel_Megiddo| , Jezreel Valley, Mount Tabor,  |Hazor|Tel_Hazor| ,  |Horns_of_Hattin|Horns_Of_Hattin| , and more.     A popular hiking trail known as the yam leyam, or sea-to-sea, starts hikers at the Mediterranean. They then hike through the Galilee mountains, Tabor, Neria, and Meron, until their final destination, the Kinneret .     In April 2011, Israel unveiled the  |Jesus_Trail|Jesus_Trail|  , a 40-mile  |hiking_trail|Hiking_Trail|  in the Galilee for Christian pilgrims. The trail includes a network of footpaths, roads, and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of Jesus and his disciples, including  |Tabgha|Tabgha| , the traditional site of Jesus miracle of the loaves and fishes, and the  |Mount_of_Beatitudes|Mount_Of_Beatitudes| , where he delivered his Sermon on the Mount. It ends at  |Capernaum|Capernaum|  on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus espoused his teachings.         Many kibbutzim and  |moshav|Moshav|  families operate  Zimmern  . Numerous festivals are held throughout the year, especially in the autumn and spring holiday seasons. These include the Acre Festival of Alternative Theater,  the olive harvest festival, music festivals featuring Anglo-American folk,  |klezmer|Klezmer| , Renaissance, and  |chamber_music|Chamber_Music| , and  |Karmiel_Dance_Festival|Karmiel_Dance_Festival| .       The cuisine of the Galilee is very diverse. The meals are lighter than in the central and southern regions. Dairy products are heavily consumed . Herbs like thyme, mint, parsley, basil, and rosemary are very common with everything including dips, meat, fish, stews and cheese.   In the eastern part of the Galilee, there is freshwater fish as much as meat , including fish filled with thyme and grilled with rosemary to flavor, or stuffed with oregano leaves, then topped with parsley and served with lemon to squash. This technique exists in other parts of the country including the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. A specialty of the region is a baked Tilapia flavored with celery, mint and a lot of lemon juice. Baked fish with tahini is also common in Tiberias while the coastal Galileans prefer to replace the tahini with yogurt and add sumac on top.     The Galilee is famous for its olives, pomegranates, wine and especially its  |Labneh|Labneh|  w |Zaatar|Zaatar|  which is served with pita bread, meat stews with wine, pomegranates and herbs such as akub, parsley,  |khalmit|Malva| , mint, fennel, etc. are common. Galilean  |kubba|Kibbeh|  is usually flavored with cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, concentrated  |pomegranate_juice|Pomegranate_Juice| , onion, parsley and pine nuts and served as meze with tahini dip.   Kebabs are also made almost in the same way with sumac replacing cardamom and with carob sometimes replacing the pomegranate juice.   Because of its climate, beef has become more popular than lamb, although both are still eaten there.   Dates are popular in the tropical climate of the Eastern Galilee.       The Galilee is often divided into these subregions:    |Lower_Galilee|Lower_Galilee|  covers the area north of the Valleys  and south of the  |Beit_HaKerem_Valley|Beit_Hakerem_Valley| . Its borders to the east on the  |Jordan_Rift_Valley|Jordan_Rift_Valley| . It contains the Arab village of  |Cana|Cana| .    |Upper_Galilee|Upper_Galilee|  extends from the  |Beit_HaKerem_Valley|Beit_Hakerem_Valley|  northwards into southern Lebanon. Its eastern border is the  |Hula_Valley|Hula_Valley|  and the Sea of Galilee separating it from the Golan Heights. To the west it reaches to the Coastal Plain which separates it from the Mediterranean.   The  |Jezreel_Valley|Jezreel_Valley| |_Jordan_Valley|Jordan_Valley| |_Beit_Shean|Beit_Shean| |_Sea_of_Galilee|Sea_Of_Galilee|  and its valley   The  |Hula_Valley|Hula_Valley| |_Mount_Gilboa|Mount_Gilboa| |_Korazim_Plateau|Korazim_Plateau| |_Rosh_HaNikra|Rosh_Hanikra|  on the  |Israel_Lebanon_border|Blue_Line| , and in the common broad definition adds the western part of Upper Galilee, and usually the northwestern part of Lower Galilee as well, corresponding more or less to Acre sub district or the  |Northern_District|Northern_District| .   The  |Galilee_Panhandle|Galilee_Panhandle|   is a  |panhandle|Salient|  along the  |Hulah_Valley|Hulah_Valley| ; it contains the towns of  |Metulla|Metulla|  and  |Qiryat_Shemona|Qiryat_Shemona| , and the  |Dan|Dan_River|  and  |Banias|Banias|  rivers.
