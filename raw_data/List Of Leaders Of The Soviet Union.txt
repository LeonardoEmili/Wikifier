During  |_its_sixty_nine_year_history|History_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  usually had a  de facto  leader who would not necessarily be  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| , but would lead while holding an office such as  |Premier|Premier_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  or  |General_Secretary|General_Secretary_Of_The_Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union| . Under the  |1977_Constitution|1977_Soviet_Constitution| , the  |Chairman_of_the_Council_of_Ministers|Council_Of_Ministers_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , or Premier, was the  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government|  and the  |Chairman|First_Deputy_Chairman_Of_The_Presidium_Of_The_Supreme_Soviet_Of_The_Ussr|  of the  |Presidium_of_the_Supreme_Soviet|Presidium_Of_The_Supreme_Soviet|  was the  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State| . The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a  |prime_minister|Prime_Minister|  in the  |First_World|First_World|  whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a  |president|President| . In the  |ideology|Leninism|  of  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin| , the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the  |vanguard_party|Vanguard_Party|  .     Following  |Joseph_Stalins|Joseph_Stalin| |_consolidation_of_power|Rise_Of_Joseph_Stalin|  in the 1920s, the post of the General Secretary of the  |Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party|Central_Committee_Of_The_Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  became synonymous with leader of the Soviet Union because the post controlled both the Communist Party and the  |Soviet_government|Government_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  both indirectly via party membership and via the tradition of a single person holding two highest posts in the party and in the government. The post of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by  |Nikita_Khrushchev|Nikita_Khrushchev|  under the name of First Secretary. In 1966,  |Leonid_Brezhnev|Leonid_Brezhnev|  reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the  |Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union|Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader the successor usually needed the support of the  |Politburo|Politburo_Of_The_Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The  |President_of_the_Soviet_Union|President_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.     Contemporaneously to establishment of the office of the President, representatives of the  |Congress_of_Peoples_Deputies|Congress_Of_Peoples_Deputies_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  voted to remove  |Article_6|Article_6_Of_The_Soviet_Constitution|  from the  |Soviet_Constitution|Soviet_Constitution|  which stated that the Soviet Union was a  |one_party_state|One_Party_State|  controlled by the Communist Party which in turn played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and  |its_people|Soviet_People| . Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the  |Vice_President_of_the_Soviet_Union|Vice_President_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  would assume the office, though the  |Soviet_Union_dissolved|Dissolution_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  before this was actually tested. After the failed  |August_1991_coup|1991_Soviet_Coup_Détat_Attempt| , the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the  |State_Council_of_the_Soviet_Union|State_Council_Of_The_Soviet_Union| .         |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin|  was voted the  |Chairman|Premier_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  of the  |Council_of_Peoples_Commissars_of_the_Soviet_Union|Council_Of_Peoples_Commissars|  on 30 December 1922 by the  |Congress_of_Soviets|Congress_Of_Soviets_Of_The_Soviet_Union| . At the age of 53, his health declined from effects of two bullet wounds, later aggravated by three  |strokes|Stroke|  which culminated with his death in 1924. Irrespective of his health status in his final days, Lenin was already losing much of his power to  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin| .  |Alexei_Rykov|Alexei_Rykov|  succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom and although he was  de jure  the most powerful person in the country, the  |Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party|Politburo_Of_The_Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  began to overshadow the Sovnarkom in the mid-1920s. By the end of the decade, Rykov merely  |rubber_stamped|Rubber_Stamp|  the decisions predetermined by Stalin and the Politburo.     Stalins early policies pushed for rapid  |industrialisation|Industrialisation| ,  |nationalisation|Nationalisation|  of private industry and the  |collectivisation|Collectivisation|  of private plots created under Lenins  |New_Economic_Policy|New_Economic_Policy| . As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the  |Great_Purge|Great_Purge| , a series of campaigns of political murder, repression and persecution.  |Nazi_German|Nazi_Germany|  troops  |invaded_the_Soviet_Union|German_Invasion_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  in June 1941, but by December the  |Soviet_Army|Soviet_Army|  managed to stop the attack just shy of Moscow. On Stalins orders, the Soviet Union launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany which finally succeeded in 1945. Stalin died in March 1953 and his death triggered a power struggle in which  |Nikita_Khrushchev|Nikita_Khrushchev|  after several years emerged victorious against  |Georgy_Malenkov|Georgy_Malenkov| .     Khrushchev denounced Stalin on two occasions, first in 1956 and then in 1962. His policy of  |de_Stalinisation|De_Stalinisation|  earned him many enemies within the party, especially from old  |Stalinist|Stalinism|  appointees. Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising. A group known as  |Anti_Party_Group|Anti_Party_Group|  tried to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957, but it failed. As Khrushchev grew older, his erratic behavior became worse, usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo.  |Leonid_Brezhnev|Leonid_Brezhnev| , a close companion of Khrushchev, was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchevs removal from power.  |Alexei_Kosygin|Alexei_Kosygin|  became the new Premier and  |Anastas_Mikoyan|Anastas_Mikoyan|  kept his office as Chairman of the  |Presidium_of_the_Supreme_Soviet|Presidium_Of_The_Supreme_Soviet| . On the orders of the Politburo, Mikoyan was forced to retire in 1965 and  |Nikolai_Podgorny|Nikolai_Podgorny|  took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium. The Soviet Union in the post-Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a  |collective_leadership|Collective_Leadership| .  |Henry_A_Kissinger|Henry_A_Kissinger| , the American  |National_Security_Advisor|National_Security_Advisor| , mistakenly believed that Kosygin was the leader of the Soviet Union and that he was at the helm of Soviet foreign policy because he represented the Soviet Union at the 1967  |Glassboro_Summit_Conference|Glassboro_Summit_Conference| . The  |Era_of_Stagnation|Brezhnev_Stagnation|  , a derogatory term coined by  |Mikhail_Gorbachev|Mikhail_Gorbachev| , was a period marked by low socio-economic efficiency in the country and a  |gerontocracy|Gerontocracy|  ruling the country.  |Yuri_Andropov|Yuri_Andropov|  succeeded Brezhnev in his post as General Secretary in 1982. In 1983, Andropov was hospitalised and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health.  |Nikolai_Tikhonov|Nikolai_Tikhonov|  usually chaired the meetings in his place. Following Andropovs death fifteen months after his appointment, an even older leader, 72 year old  |Konstantin_Chernenko|Konstantin_Chernenko| , was elected to the General Secretariat. His rule lasted for little more than a year until his death thirteen months later on 10 March 1985.     At the age of 54, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the General Secretariat by the Politburo on 11 March 1985. In May 1985, Gorbachev publicly admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequate living standards, being the first Soviet leader to do so while also beginning a series of fundamental reforms. From 1986 to around 1988, he was advertised in a Pizza Hut advertisement, dismantled  |central_planning|Central_Planning| , allowed state enterprises to set their own outputs, enabled private investment in businesses not previously permitted to be privately owned and allowed foreign investment, among other measures. He also opened up the management of and decision-making within the Soviet Union and allowed greater public discussion and criticism, along with a warming of relationships with the West. These twin policies were known as  perestroika  and  glasnost  , respectively. The dismantling of the principal defining features of  |Soviet_Communism|Ideology_Of_The_Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union led to the unintended consequence of the  |Soviet_Union_breaking_up|Breakup_Of_The_Soviet_Union|  after the failed  |August_1991_coup|1991_Soviet_Coup_Détat_Attempt|  led by  |Gennady_Yanayev|Gennady_Yanayev| .       The following list includes persons who held the top leadership position of the Soviet Union from its  |founding|Treaty_On_The_Creation_Of_The_Ussr|  in 1922 until its  |1991_dissolution|Dissolution_Of_The_Soviet_Union| .
