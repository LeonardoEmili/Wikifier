He went to a  |yeshiva|Yeshiva|  in  |Piatra_Neamţ|Piatra_Neamţ|  at age 10 and at age thirteen studied with one of the major  |Talmud|Talmud| ic scholars, Rabbi  |Joseph_Saul_Nathanson|Joseph_Saul_Nathanson|  of  |Lemberg|Lviv| .  at home.earthlink.net In his 20s, he went to the Rabbinical College in  |Vienna|Vienna| , where he studied under the more modern Talmudic scholar  |Meir_Friedmann|Meir_Friedmann| , before moving on in 1879 to undertake further studies at the  Berlin Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums  and at the  |University_of_Berlin|University_Of_Berlin| . In 1882, he was invited to  |Britain|United_Kingdom| , to be  |tutor|Tutor|  of  |rabbinics|Rabbinics|  under  |Claude_Montefiore|Claude_Montefiore|  in  |London|London| .       In 1890, after the death of  |Solomon_Marcus_Schiller-Szinessy|Solomon_Marcus_Schiller-Szinessy| , he was appointed to the faculty at  |Cambridge_University|Cambridge_University| , serving as a lecturer in  |Talmud|Talmud| ics and reader in Rabbinics.  To this day, the students of the Cambridge University Jewish Society hold an annual Solomon Schechter Memorial Lecture.     His greatest academic fame came from his excavation in 1896 of the papers of the  |Cairo_Geniza|Cairo_Geniza| , an extraordinary collection of over 100,000 pages of rare Hebrew religious manuscripts and medieval Jewish texts that were preserved at an  |Egypt|Egypt| ian synagogue. The find revolutionized the study of Medieval Judaism.      |Jacob_Saphir|Jacob_Saphir|  was the first Jewish researcher to recognize the significance of the Cairo Geniza, as well as the first to publicize the existence of the  |Midrash_ha-Gadol|Midrash_Ha-Gadol| . Schechter was alerted to the existence of the Genizas papers in May 1896 by two Scottish sisters,  |Mrs._Lewis_and_Mrs._Gibson|Agnes_And_Margaret_Smith| , who showed him some leaves from the Geniza that contained the Hebrew text of  |Sirach|Wisdom_Of_Sirach| , which had for centuries only been known in  |Greek|Greek_Language|  and  |Latin|Latin|  translation.

London: Vintage, 239 - 40 Letters, written at Schechters prompting, by Agnes Smith to  The Athenaeum  and  The Academy  quickly revealed the existence of another nine leaves of the same manuscript in the possession of  |Archibald_Sayce|Archibald_Sayce|  at Oxford University. Soskice, Janet Sisters of Sinai. London: Vintage, 241 - 2 Schechter quickly found support for another expedition to the Cairo Geniza, and arrived there in December 1896 with an introduction from the Chief Rabbi,  |Hermann_Adler|Hermann_Adler| , to the Chief Rabbi of Cairo, Aaron Raphael Ben Shimon.

London: Vintage, 246 He carefully selected for the  |Cambridge_University_Library|Cambridge_University_Library|  a trove three times the size of any other collection: this is now part of the  |Taylor-Schechter_Collection|Charles_Taylor| . The find was instrumental in Schechter resolving a dispute with  |David_Margoliouth|David_Samuel_Margoliouth|  as to the likely Hebrew language origins of  |Sirach|Sirach| . Soskice, Janet Sisters of Sinai. London: Vintage, 240 - 41     Charles Taylor took a great interest in Solomon Schechters work in Cairo, and the  genizah  fragments presented to the University of Cambridge are known as the Taylor-Schechter Collection.  He was joint editor with Schechter of The Wisdom of Ben Sira, 1899. He published separately Cairo Genizah Palimpsests, 1900.     He became a Professor of Hebrew at  |University_College_London|University_College_London|  in 1899 and remained until 1902 when he moved to the  |United_States|United_States|  and was replaced by  |Israel_Abrahams|Israel_Abrahams| .       In 1902, traditional Jews reacting against the progress of the American  |Reform_Judaism|Reform_Judaism|  movement, which was trying to establish an authoritative synod of American rabbis, recruited Schechter to become President of the  |Jewish_Theological_Seminary_of_America|Jewish_Theological_Seminary_Of_America|  .     Schechter served as the second President of the JTSA, from 1902 to 1915, during which time he founded the United Synagogue of America, later renamed as the  |United_Synagogue_of_Conservative_Judaism|United_Synagogue_Of_Conservative_Judaism| .       Schechter emphasized the centrality of  |Jewish_law|Halakha|  in Jewish life in a speech in his inaugural address as President of the JTSA in 1902:     : Judaism is not a religion which does not oppose itself to anything in particular. Judaism is opposed to any number of things and says distinctly thou shalt not. It permeates the whole of your life. It demands control over all of your actions, and interferes even with your menu. It sanctifies the seasons, and regulates your history, both in the past and in the future. Above all, it teaches that disobedience is the strength of sin. It insists upon the observance of both the spirit and of the letter; spirit without letter belongs to the species known to the mystics as nude souls , wandering about in the universe without balance and without consistency...In a word, Judaism is absolutely incompatible with the abandonment of the  |Torah|Torah| .     Schechter, on the other hand, believed in what he termed Catholic Israel. The basic idea being that Jewish law,  |Halacha|Halacha| , is formed and evolves based on the behavior of the people. This concept of modifying the law based on national consensus is an untraditional viewpoint.     Schechter was an early advocate of  |Zionism|Zionism| . He was the chairman of the committee that edited the  |Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America_Version|Jewish_Publication_Society_Of_America_Version|  of the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| .          Schechters name is synonymous with the findings of the Cairo Geniza. He placed the JTSA on an institutional footing strong enough to endure for over a century. He became identified as the foremost personality of Conservative Judaism and is regarded as its founder. A network of  |Conservative|Conservative_Judaism| |Jewish_day_schools|Jewish_Day_School|  is named in his honor, as well as a summer camp in Olympia, Washington. There are several dozen  |Solomon_Schechter_Day_Schools|Solomon_Schechter_Day_School_Association|  across the United States and Canada.       Schechter, Solomon Studies in Judaism. 3 vols.
