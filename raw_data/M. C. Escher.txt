              Maurits Cornelis Escher  was a Dutch  |graphic_artist|Graphic_Designer|  who made  |mathematically-inspired|Mathematics_And_Art| |woodcuts|Woodcut| ,  |lithographs|Lithography| , and  |mezzotints|Mezzotint| .   Despite wide popular interest, Escher was for long somewhat neglected in the art world, even in his native Netherlands. He was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held. In the twenty-first century, he became more widely appreciated, with exhibitions across the world.     His work features mathematical objects and operations including  |impossible_objects|Impossible_Object| , explorations of  |infinity|Infinity| ,  |reflection|Reflection| ,  |symmetry|Symmetry| ,  |perspective|Perspective| ,  |truncated|Truncation|  and  |stellated_polyhedra|Stellation| ,  |hyperbolic_geometry|Hyperbolic_Geometry| , and  |tessellations|Tessellation| . Although Escher believed he had no mathematical ability, he interacted with the mathematicians  |George_Pólya|George_Pólya| ,  |Roger_Penrose|Roger_Penrose| ,  |Harold_Coxeter|Harold_Scott_Macdonald_Coxeter|  and  |crystallographer|Crystallography| |Friedrich_Haag|Friedrich_Haag| , and conducted his own research into  |tessellation|Tessellation| .     Early in his career, he drew inspiration from  |nature|Nature| , making studies of  |insects|Insect| ,  |landscapes|Landscape| , and  |plants|Plant|  such as  |lichens|Lichen| , all of which he used as details in his artworks. He traveled in Italy and Spain, sketching buildings, townscapes, architecture and the tilings of the  |Alhambra|Alhambra|  and  |the_Mezquita_of_Cordoba|Mosque–Cathedral_Of_Córdoba| , and became steadily more interested in their  |mathematical_structure|Mathematical_Structure| .     Eschers art became well known among scientists and mathematicians, and in popular culture, especially after it was featured by  |Martin_Gardner|Martin_Gardner|  in his April 1966  |Mathematical_Games_column|Mathematical_Games_Column|  in  Scientific American . Apart from being used in a variety of  |technical_papers|Technical_Papers| , his work has appeared on the covers of many books and albums. He was one of the major inspirations of  |Douglas_Hofstadters|Douglas_Hofstadter| |Pulitzer_Prize|Pulitzer_Prize| -winning 1979 book  Gödel, Escher, Bach .            Maurits Cornelis Escher was born on 17 June 1898 in  |Leeuwarden|Leeuwarden| ,  |Friesland|Friesland| , the Netherlands, in a house that forms part of the  |Princessehof_Ceramics_Museum|Princessehof_Ceramics_Museum|  today. He was the youngest son of the  |civil_engineer|Civil_Engineer| |George_Arnold_Escher|George_Arnold_Escher|  and his second wife, Sara Gleichman. In 1903, the family moved to  |Arnhem|Arnhem| , where he attended primary and secondary school until 1918.   Known to his friends and family as Mauk , he was a sickly child and was placed in a special school at the age of seven; he failed the second grade.  Although he excelled at drawing, his grades were generally poor. He took  |carpentry|Carpentry|  and piano lessons until he was thirteen years old.     In 1918, he went to the  |Technical_College_of_Delft|Delft_University_Of_Technology| . From 1919 to 1922, Escher attended the  |Haarlem|Haarlem|  School of Architecture and Decorative Arts, learning drawing and the art of making  |woodcuts|Woodcut| . He briefly studied  |architecture|Architecture| , but he failed a number of subjects and switched to  |decorative_arts|Decorative_Arts| , studying under the graphic artist  |Samuel_Jessurun_de_Mesquita|Samuel_Jessurun_De_Mesquita| . Locher, 1974. p. 5            In 1922, an important year of his life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting  |Florence|Florence| ,  |San_Gimignano|San_Gimignano| ,  |Volterra|Volterra| ,  |Siena|Siena| , and  |Ravello|Ravello| . In the same year, he traveled through Spain, visiting  |Madrid|Madrid| ,  |Toledo|Toledo,_Spain| , and  |Granada|Granada| . He was impressed by the Italian countryside and, in Granada, by the  |Moorish_architecture|Moorish_Architecture|  of the fourteenth-century  |Alhambra|Alhambra| . The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on  |geometrical|Geometry| |symmetries|Symmetry|  featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of  |tessellation|Tessellation|  and became a powerful influence on his work.            Escher returned to Italy and lived in  |Rome|Rome|  from 1923 to 1935. While in Italy, Escher met Jetta Umiker  – a Swiss woman, like himself attracted to Italy  – whom he married in 1924. The couple settled in Rome where their first son, Giorgio Arnaldo Escher, named after his grandfather, was born. Escher and Jetta later had two more sons  – Arthur and Jan.      He travelled frequently, visiting  |Viterbo|Viterbo|  in 1926, the  |Abruzzi|Abruzzo|  in 1927 and 1929,  |Corsica|Corsica|  in 1928 and 1933,  |Calabria|Calabria|  in 1930, the  |Amalfi|Amalfi|  coast in 1931 and 1934, and  |Gargano|Gargano|  and  |Sicily|Sicily|  in 1932 and 1935. The townscapes and landscapes of these places feature prominently in his artworks. In May and June 1936, Escher travelled back to Spain, revisiting the Alhambra and spending days at a time making detailed drawings of its mosaic patterns. It was here that he became fascinated, to the point of obsession, with tessellation, explaining:          The sketches he made in the Alhambra formed a major source for his work from that time on. He also studied the architecture of the  |Mezquita|Mosque–Cathedral_Of_Córdoba| , the Moorish mosque of Cordoba. This turned out to be the last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field. His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. All the same, even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space, the unusual, perspective, and multiple points of view.         In 1935, the political climate in Italy  became unacceptable to Escher. He had no interest in politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a  |Ballila|Opera_Nazionale_Balilla|  uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to  |Château-dŒx|Château-Dœx| , Switzerland, where they remained for two years. Ernst, Bruno,  The Magic Mirror of M.C. Escher, Taschen, 1978; p. 15     The Netherlands post office had Escher design a  |semi-postal_stamp|Semi-Postal_Stamp|  for the Air Fund in 1935,  and again in 1949 he designed Netherlands stamps. These were for the 75th anniversary of the  |Universal_Postal_Union|Universal_Postal_Union| ; a different design was used by  |Surinam|Surinam|  and the  |Netherlands_Antilles|Netherlands_Antilles|  for the same commemoration.          Escher, who had been very fond of and inspired by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to  |Uccle|Uccle|  , a suburb of  |Brussels|Brussels| , Belgium.  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  forced them to move in January 1941, this time to  |Baarn|Baarn| , Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Eschers best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold, and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published as part of the book Escher on Escher.  He was awarded the Knighthood of the  |Order_of_Orange-Nassau|Order_Of_Orange-Nassau|  in 1955; he was later made an Officer in 1967.      In July 1969 he finished his last work, a large woodcut with threefold  |rotational_symmetry|Rotational_Symmetry|  called  Snakes , in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both the center and the edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Eschers love of symmetry; of interlocking patterns; and, at the end of his life, of his approach to infinity. Locher, 1974. p. 151   The care that Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.      Escher moved to the  |Rosa_Spier_Huis|Rosa_Spier_Huis|  in  |Laren|Laren,_North_Holland|  in 1970, an artists retirement home in which he had his own studio. He died in a hospital in  |Hilversum|Hilversum|  on 27 March 1972, aged 73. He is buried at the New Cemetery in Baarn. ,  |Netherlands_Institute_for_Art_History|Netherlands_Institute_For_Art_History| , 2015. Retrieved 6 November 2015. , Vorstelijk Baarn. Retrieved 6 November 2015.            Eschers work is inescapably mathematical. This has caused a disconnect between his full-on popular fame and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques are respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as  |conceptual_art|Conceptual_Art|  have, to a degree, reversed the art worlds attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher, because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Locher, 1974. p. 13     Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes:  |Parmigianino|Parmigianino|  had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524  Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror , depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while  |William_Hogarths|William_Hogarth|  1754  Satire on False Perspective  foreshadows Eschers playful exploration of errors in perspective. Locher, 1974. pp. 11–12 Another early artistic forerunner is  |Giovanni_Battista_Piranesi|Giovanni_Battista_Piranesi|  , whose dark fantastical prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri sequence depict perspectives of complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures.   Only with 20th century movements such as  |Cubism|Cubism| ,  |De_Stijl|De_Stijl| ,  |Dada|Dada| ism, and  |Surrealism|Surrealism|  did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints. However, although Escher had much in common with, for example,  |Magrittes|Magritte|  surrealism, he did not make contact with any of these movements.   |curved_perspectives|Curvilinear_Perspective| , geometries, and reflections:  |Parmigianinos|Parmigianino|   Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror   |William_Hogarths|William_Hogarth|   Satire on False Perspective   |Piranesis|Giovanni_Battista_Piranesi|  Carceri Plate VII  – The Drawbridge, 1745, reworked 1761              In his early years, Escher sketched landscapes and nature. He also sketched insects such as  |ants|Ant| ,  |bees|Bee| ,  |grasshoppers|Grasshopper| , and  |mantis|Mantis| es, Locher, 1974. pp. 62–63 which appeared frequently in his later work. His early love of  |Roman|Ancient_Rome|  and Italian landscapes and of nature created an interest in  |tessellation|Tessellation| , which he called  Regular Division of the Plane ; this became the title of his 1958 book, complete with reproductions of a series of woodcuts based on tessellations of the plane, in which he described the systematic buildup of mathematical designs in his artworks. He wrote,  |Mathematicians|Mathematician|  have opened the gate leading to an extensive domain .           After his 1936 journey to the  |Alhambra|Alhambra|  and to  |La_Mezquita|Mosque–Cathedral_Of_Córdoba| ,  |Cordoba|Córdoba,_Andalusia| , where he sketched the  |Moorish|Moors|  architecture and the tessellated mosaic decorations, Locher, 1974. pp. 17, 70–71 Escher began to explore the properties and possibilities of tessellation using geometric grids as the basis for his sketches. He then extended these to form complex interlocking designs, for example with animals such as  |birds|Bird| ,  |fish|Fish| , and  |reptiles|Reptile| . Locher, 1974. pp. 79–85 One of his first attempts at a tessellation was his pencil, India ink, and watercolour Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles , constructed on a  |hexagon|Hexagon| al grid. The heads of the red, green, and white reptiles meet at a vertex; the tails, legs, and sides of the animals interlock exactly. It was used as the basis for his 1943 lithograph  Reptiles . Locher, 1974. p. 18     His first study of mathematics began with papers by  |George_Pólya|George_Pólya|   and by the crystallographer  |Friedrich_Haag|Friedrich_Haag|   on plane  |symmetry_groups|Symmetry_Group| , sent to him by his brother  |Berend|Berend_George_Escher| , a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 canonical  |wallpaper_groups|Wallpaper_Group|  and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of  |symmetry|Symmetry| . From this point on, he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his artworks using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His  Metamorphosis I  began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed  |convex_polygons|Convex_Polygon|  into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece  Metamorphosis III , which is four metres long. Locher, 1974. p. 84     In 1941 and 1942, Escher summarized his findings for his own artistic use in a sketchbook, which he labeled Regelmatige vlakverdeling in asymmetrische congruente veelhoeken .  The mathematician  |Doris_Schattschneider|Doris_Schattschneider|  unequivocally described this notebook as recording a methodical investigation that can only be termed mathematical research. She defined the research questions he was following as                      Although Escher did not have mathematical training—his understanding of mathematics was largely visual and intuitive—his  |art_had_a_strong_mathematical_component|Mathematics_And_Art| , and several of the worlds that he drew were built around  |impossible_objects|Impossible_Object| . After 1924, Escher turned to sketching landscapes in Italy and  |Corsica|Corsica|  with irregular  |perspectives|Perspective|  that are impossible in natural form. His first print of an impossible reality was  Still Life and Street  ; impossible stairs and multiple visual and gravitational perspectives feature in popular works such as  Relativity  .  House of Stairs  attracted the interest of the mathematician  |Roger_Penrose|Roger_Penrose|  and his father, the biologist  |Lionel_Penrose|Lionel_Penrose| . In 1956, they published a paper, Impossible Objects: A Special Type of Visual Illusion and later sent Escher a copy. Escher replied, admiring the Penroses  |continuously_rising_flights_of_steps|Penrose_Stairs| , and enclosed a print of  Ascending and Descending  . The paper also contained the tribar or  |Penrose_triangle|Penrose_Triangle| , which Escher used repeatedly in his lithograph of a building that appears to function as a  |perpetual_motion|Perpetual_Motion|  machine,  Waterfall  .  Chapter 5 is on Escher.        Escher was interested enough in  |Hieronymus_Boschs|Hieronymus_Bosch|  1500 triptych  The Garden of Earthly Delights  to re-create part of its right-hand panel, Hell, as a lithograph in 1935. He reused the figure of a  |Mediaeval|Middle_Ages|  woman in a two-pointed headdress and a long gown in his lithograph  Belvedere  in 1958; the image is, like many of his other extraordinary invented places ,  peopled with  |jesters|Jester| ,  |knaves|Wikt:Knave| , and contemplators . Thus, Escher not only was interested in possible or impossible geometry but was, in his own words, a reality enthusiast ; he combined formal astonishment with a vivid and idiosyncratic vision .          Escher worked primarily in the media of  |lithographs|Lithography|  and  |woodcuts|Woodcut| , although the few  |mezzotints|Mezzotint|  he made are considered to be masterpieces of the technique. In his graphic art, he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes, figures, and space. Integrated into his prints were mirror images of cones, spheres, cubes, rings, and spirals.      Escher was also fascinated by mathematical objects such as the  |Möbius_strip|Möbius_Strip| , which has only one surface. His wood engraving Möbius Strip II depicts a chain of  |ants|Ant|  marching forever over what, at any one place, are the two opposite faces of the object—which are seen on inspection to be parts of the strips single surface. In Eschers own words:  which cites           The mathematical influence in his work became prominent after 1936, when, having boldly asked the Adria Shipping Company if he could sail with them as travelling artist in return for making drawings of their ships, they surprisingly agreed, and he sailed the  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean_Sea| , becoming interested in order and symmetry. Escher described this journey, including his repeat visit to the Alhambra, as the richest source of inspiration I have ever tapped .  which cites      Eschers interest in  |curvilinear_perspective|Curvilinear_Perspective|  was encouraged by his friend and kindred spirit ,  the art historian and artist Albert Flocon, in another example of constructive mutual influence. Flocon identified Escher as a thinking artist alongside  |Piero_della_Francesca|Piero_Della_Francesca| ,  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci| ,  |Albrecht_Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer| ,  |Wenzel_Jamnitzer|Wenzel_Jamnitzer| ,  |Abraham_Bosse|Abraham_Bosse| ,  |Girard_Desargues|Girard_Desargues| , and  |Père_Nicon|Père_Nicon| . Flocon was delighted by Eschers Grafiek en tekeningen , which he read in 1959. This stimulated Flocon and André Barre to correspond with Escher and to write the book La Perspective curviligne .             Escher often incorporated three-dimensional objects such as the  |Platonic_solids|Platonic_Solid|  such as spheres, tetrahedrons, and cubes into his works, as well as mathematical objects such as  |cylinders|Cylinder|  and  |stellated_polyhedra|Stellation| . In the print  |Reptiles|Reptiles| , he combined two- and three-dimensional images. In one of his papers, Escher emphasized the importance of dimensionality:          Eschers artwork is especially well-liked by mathematicians such as  |Doris_Schattschneider|Doris_Schattschneider|  and scientists such as  |Roger_Penrose|Roger_Penrose| , who enjoy his use of  |polyhedra|Polyhedron|  and  |geometric|Geometry|  distortions.  For example, in  Gravitation , animals climb around a  |stellated|Stellation| |dodecahedron|Dodecahedron| .      The two towers of Waterfall impossible building are topped with compound polyhedra, one a  |compound_of_three_cubes|Compound_Of_Three_Cubes| , the other a stellated  |rhombic_dodecahedron|Rhombic_Dodecahedron|  now known as  |Eschers_solid|Compound_Of_Three_Octahedra| . Escher had used this solid in his 1948 woodcut  Stars , which also contains all five of the  |Platonic_solids|Platonic_Solid|  and various stellated solids, representing stars; the central solid is animated by  |chameleons|Chameleon|  climbing through the frame as it whirls in space. Escher possessed a 6  cm  |refracting_telescope|Refracting_Telescope|  and was a keen-enough amateur  |astronomer|Astronomer|  to have recorded observations of  |binary_stars|Binary_Star| . Locher, 1974. p. 104              Eschers artistic expression was created from images in his mind, rather than directly from observations and travels to other countries. His interest in the multiple levels of reality in art is seen in works such as  Drawing Hands  , where two hands are shown, each drawing the other. The critic Steven Poole commented that                 In 1954, the International Congress of Mathematicians met in Amsterdam, and N. G. de Bruin organized a display of Eschers work at the Stedelijk Museum for the participants. Both Roger Penrose and  |H._S._M._Coxeter|Harold_Scott_Macdonald_Coxeter|  were deeply impressed with Eschers intuitive grasp of mathematics. Inspired by Relativity, Penrose devised his  |tribar|Penrose_Tribar| , and his father, Lionel Penrose, devised an endless staircase. Roger Penrose sent sketches of both objects to Escher, and the cycle of invention was closed when Escher then created the  |perpetual_motion|Perpetual_Motion|  machine of Waterfall and the endless march of the monk-figures of Ascending and Descending.   In 1957, Coxeter obtained Eschers permission to use two of his drawings in his paper Crystal symmetry and its generalizations .  He sent Escher a copy of the paper; Escher recorded that Coxeters figure of a hyperbolic tessellation gave me quite a shock : the infinite regular repetition of the tiles in the  |hyperbolic_plane|Models_Of_The_Hyperbolic_Plane| , growing rapidly smaller towards the edge of the circle, was precisely what he wanted to allow him to represent  |infinity|Infinity|  on a two-dimensional plane.           Escher carefully studied Coxeters figure, marking it up to analyse the successively smaller circles with which it had been constructed. He then constructed a diagram, which he sent to Coxeter, showing his analysis; Coxeter confirmed it was correct, but disappointed Escher with his highly technical reply. All the same, Escher persisted with  |hyperbolic_tiling|Hyperbolic_Tiling| , which he called Coxetering . Among the results were the series of wood engravings Circle Limit I–IV. In 1959, Coxeter published his finding that these works were extraordinarily accurate: Escher got it absolutely right to the millimeter .  which cites             Eschers special way of thinking and rich graphics have had a continuous influence in mathematics and art, as well as  |in_popular_culture|M._C._Escher_In_Popular_Culture| .         The Escher  |intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property|  is controlled by the M.C. Escher Company, while exhibitions of his artworks are managed separately by the M.C. Escher Foundation.     The primary institutional collections of original works by M.C. Escher are the  |Escher_Museum|Escher_Museum|  in  |The_Hague|The_Hague| ; the  |National_Gallery_of_Art|National_Gallery_Of_Art|  ;  the  |National_Gallery_of_Canada|National_Gallery_Of_Canada|  ;  the  |Israel_Museum|Israel_Museum|  ;  and the  |Huis_ten_Bosch|Huis_Ten_Bosch|  .             Despite wide popular interest, Escher was for a long time somewhat neglected in the art world; even in his native Netherlands, he was 70 before a retrospective exhibition was held.  In the twenty-first century, major exhibitions have been held in cities across the world. An exhibition of his work in Rio de Janeiro attracted more than 573,000 visitors in 2011;  its daily visitor count of 9,677 made it the most visited museum exhibition of the year, anywhere in the world.  No major exhibition of Eschers work was held in Britain until 2015, when the  |Scottish_National_Gallery_of_Modern_Art|Scottish_National_Gallery_Of_Modern_Art|  ran one in  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh|  from June to September 2015,  moving in October 2015 to the  |Dulwich_Picture_Gallery|Dulwich_Picture_Gallery| , London. The exhibition moved to Italy in 2015–2016, attracting over 500,000 visitors in Rome and Bologna,  and then  |Milan|Milan| .                |Doris_Schattschneider|Doris_Schattschneider|  identifies eleven strands of mathematical and scientific research anticipated or directly inspired by Escher. These are the classification of regular tilings using the edge relationships of tiles: two-color and two-motif tilings ; color symmetry ; metamorphosis or  |topological|Topology|  change; covering surfaces with symmetric patterns; Eschers algorithm ; creating tile shapes; local versus global definitions of regularity; symmetry of a tiling induced by the symmetry of a tile; orderliness not induced by symmetry groups; the filling of the central void in Eschers lithograph  Print Gallery  by H. Lenstra and B. de Smit.     The  |Pulitzer_Prize|Pulitzer_Prize| -winning 1979 book  Gödel, Escher, Bach  by  |Douglas_Hofstadter|Douglas_Hofstadter|   discusses the ideas of self-reference and  |strange_loops|Strange_Loop| , drawing on a wide range of artistic and scientific sources including Eschers art and the music of  |J._S._Bach|Johann_Sebastian_Bach| .     The  |asteroid|Asteroid| |4444_Escher|4444_Escher|  was named in Eschers honor in 1985.             Eschers fame in popular culture grew when his work was featured by  |Martin_Gardner|Martin_Gardner|  in his April 1966  |Mathematical_Games_column|Mathematical_Games_Column|  in  Scientific American .  Eschers works have appeared on many album covers including  |The_Scaffolds|The_Scaffold|  1969 L the P with Ascending and Descending;  |Mott_the_Hooples|Mott_The_Hoople|  eponymous 1969 record with Reptiles,  |Beaver_&_Krauses|Beaver_&_Krause|  1970 In A Wild Sanctuary with Three Worlds; and  |Mandrake_Memorials|Mandrake_Memorial|  1970 Puzzle with House of Stairs and Curl Up. His works have similarly been used on many book covers, including some editions of  |Edwin_Abbotts|Edwin_Abbott_Abbott|  Flatland, which used Three Spheres;  |E._H._Gombrichs|Ernst_Gombrich|  Meditations on a Hobby Horse with Horseman; Pamela Halls Heads You Lose with Plane Filling 1; Patrick A. Hortons Mastering the Power of Story with Drawing Hands;  |Erich_Gamma|Erich_Gamma|  et al.s Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-oriented software with Swans; and Arthur Markmans Knowledge Representation with Reptiles. The World of Escher markets  |posters|Poster| ,  |neckties|Necktie| ,  |T-shirts|T-Shirt| , and  |jigsaw_puzzles|Jigsaw_Puzzle|  of Eschers artworks.  Both Austria and the Netherlands have issued  |postage_stamp|Postage_Stamp| .
