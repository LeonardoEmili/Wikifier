            Neil Gordon Kinnock, Baron Kinnock,  is a British  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  politician. He served as a  |Member_of_Parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  from  |1970|1970_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  until  |1995|1995_Islwyn_By-Election| , first for  |Bedwellty|Bedwellty|  and then for  |Islwyn|Islwyn| . He was the  |Leader_of_the_Labour_Party|Leader_Of_The_Labour_Party|  and  |Leader_of_the_Opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition|  from  |1983|1983_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  until  |1992|1992_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election| .     Kinnock led the Labour Party to a surprise fourth consecutive defeat at the  |1992_general_election|1992_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , despite the party being ahead in most opinion polls, which had predicted either a narrow Labour victory or a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament| . Afterwards, he resigned as Leader of the Labour Party. He left the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in 1995 to become a  |European_Commissioner|European_Commissioner| . He went on to become the  |Vice-President_of_the_European_Commission|Vice-President_Of_The_European_Commission|  under  |Romano_Prodi|Romano_Prodi|  from 1999–2004.     Until the summer of 2009, he was also the  |Chairman_of_the_British_Council|British_Council|  and the  |President_of_Cardiff_University|Cardiff_University| .        Kinnock, an only child, was born in  |Tredegar|Tredegar| ,  |Wales|Wales| .  His father, Gordon Herbert Kinnock was a former  |coal_miner|Coal_Miner|  who suffered from  |dermatitis|Dermatitis|  and later worked as a labourer; and his mother Mary Kinnock was a district nurse.    Gordon died of a  |heart_attack|Heart_Attack|  in November 1971 aged 64;  Mary died the following month aged 61.     In 1953, at eleven years old, Kinnock began his  |secondary_education|Secondary_Education|  at  |Lewis_School,_Pengam|Lewis_School,_Pengam| , which he later criticised for its record on  |caning|School_Corporal_Punishment| . He went on to the  |University_College_of_South_Wales_and_Monmouthshire|University_College_Of_South_Wales_And_Monmouthshire|  in Cardiff , where he graduated with a degree in Industrial Relations and History in 1965. The following year, Kinnock obtained a postgraduate diploma in education. Between August 1966 and May 1970, he worked as a tutor for a  |Workers_Educational_Association|Workers_Educational_Association|  .      He has been married to  |Glenys_Kinnock|Glenys_Kinnock,_Baroness_Kinnock_Of_Holyhead|  since 1967. They have two children – son  |Stephen_Kinnock|Stephen_Kinnock|  , and daughter Rachel Kinnock . , Sunday Mirror, 22 July 2001.       In June 1969, he won the Labour Party nomination for  |Bedwellty|Bedwellty|  in  |South_Wales|South_Wales| , which became  |Islwyn|Islwyn|  for the  |1983_general_election|1983_United_Kingdom_General_Election| .     He was first elected to the  |House_of_Commons|British_House_Of_Commons|  on 18 June 1970, and became a member of the  |National_Executive_Committee_of_the_Labour_Party|National_Executive_Committee_Of_The_Labour_Party|  in October 1978. On his becoming an MP for the first time, his father said Remember Neil, MP stands not just for Member of Parliament, but also for Man of Principle.     The Labour government policy at that time was in favour of  |devolution_for_Wales|Devolution_For_Wales| , but the wider party was split. Calling himself a  |unionist|British_Unionism|  , Kinnock was one of six  |south_Wales|South_Wales|  Labour MPs to campaign against devolution. He dismissed the idea of a  |Welsh_identity|Welsh_Identity| , saying that between the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century Wales had practically no history at all, and even before that it was the history of rural brigands who have been ennobled by being called princes .  In the  |Welsh_referendum_of_1979|1979_Welsh_Devolution_Referendum| , the proposal for devolution was rejected.     Following Labours defeat at the  |1979_general_election|1979_United_Kingdom_General_Election| ,  |James_Callaghan|James_Callaghan|  appointed Neil Kinnock to the  |Shadow_Cabinet|Shadow_Cabinet|  as Education spokesman. His ambition was noted by other MPs, and  |David_Owens|David_Owen|  opposition to the changes to the  |electoral_college|Electoral_College|  was thought to be motivated by the realisation that they would favour Kinnocks succession. He remained as Education spokesman following the resignation of Callaghan as Leader of the Labour Party and the election of  |Michael_Foot|Michael_Foot|  as his successor in late 1980.     In 1981, when still serving as Labours Education spokesman, Kinnock was alleged to have effectively scuppered  |Tony_Benns|Tony_Benn|  attempt to replace  |Denis_Healey|Denis_Healey|  as Labours Deputy Leader by first supporting the candidacy of the more traditionalist Tribunite  |John_Silkin|John_Silkin|  and then urging Silkin supporters to abstain on the second, run-off, ballot.     He was known as a  |left-winger|Left-Wing_Politics| , and gained prominence for his attacks on  |Margaret_Thatchers|Margaret_Thatcher|  handling of the  |Falklands_War|Falklands_War|  in 1982, although it was in fact this conflict which saw support for the  |Conservative|Conservative_Party|  government increase, and contribute to its landslide re-election the following year.                   Following Labours landslide defeat in  |June_1983|1983_United_Kingdom_General_Election| ,  |Michael_Foot|Michael_Foot|  resigned as leader aged 69, and from the outset it was expected that the much younger Kinnock would succeed him. He was finally  |elected_as_Labour_Party_leader|1983_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  on 2 October 1983, with 71 per cent of the vote, and  |Roy_Hattersley|Roy_Hattersley|  was elected as his deputy; their prospective partnership was considered to be a dream ticket .      His first period as party leader – between the  |1983|1983_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  and  |1987_general_elections|1987_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  – was dominated by his struggle with the  |hard-left|Hard-Left| |Militant_tendency|Militant| , then still strong in the party. Kinnock was determined to move the partys political standing to a  |centrist|Centrist|  position, in order to improve its chances of winning a future general election. , BBC Politics 97 Although Kinnock had come from the  |Tribune|Tribune_Group| |left|Left-Wing_Politics|  of the party, he parted company with many of his former allies after his appointment to the Shadow Cabinet.     The Labour Party was also threatened by the rise of the  |Social_Democratic_Party|Social_Democratic_Party| / |Liberal_Alliance|Sdp-Liberal_Alliance| , which pulled out more centrist adherents. On a broader perspective, the traditional Labour voter was disappearing in the face of growing education, wealth, and social mobility that the Conservative government had promoted since 1979. Kinnock focused on modernising the party, and upgrading its technical skills such as use of the media and keeping track of voters, while at the same time battling the Militants. Under his leadership, the Labour Party abandoned unpopular old positions, especially the  |nationalisation|Nationalisation|  of certain industries, although this process was not completed until future Labour leader  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  removed Clause IV from the partys manifesto in 1995. He stressed economic growth, which had a much broader appeal to the  |middle-class|Middle-Class|  than the idea of redistributing wealth to benefit the poor. He accepted membership in the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community| , whereas the party had pledged immediate withdrawal from it under  |Michael_Foot|Michael_Foot| . He discarded the rhetoric of class warfare. F.M. Leventhal, ed., Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia p 424.     All this meant that Kinnock had made plenty of enemies on the left wing of the party by the time he was elected as leader, though a substantial number of former Bennites gave him strong support. He was almost immediately in serious difficulty as a result of  |Arthur_Scargills|Arthur_Scargill|  decision to lead his union, the  |National_Union_of_Mineworkers|National_Union_Of_Mineworkers|  into a national strike without a nationwide ballot. The NUM was widely regarded as the labour movements  |praetorian_guard|Praetorian_Guard|  and the strike convulsed the Labour movement. Kinnock supported the aim of the strike – which he dubbed the case for coal – but, as an MP from a mining area, was bitterly critical of the tactics employed. When heckled at a Labour Party rally for referring to the  |killing_of_David_Wilkie|Killing_Of_David_Wilkie|  as an outrage , Kinnock lost his temper and accused the hecklers of living like parasites off the struggle of the miners and implied that Scargill had lied to the striking miners.  In 1985, he made his criticisms public in a speech to Labours conference:     In 2004, Kinnock said of Scargill, Oh I detest him. I did then, I do now, and its mutual. He hates me as well. And Id much prefer to have his savage hatred than even the merest hint of friendship from that man.      The strikes defeat early in the year,  and the bad publicity associated with the  |entryism|Entryism|  practised by the Trotskyist  |Militant|Militant|  group were the immediate context for the 1985 Labour Party conference. For a history of the Militant tendency in the Labour Party, see Eric Shaw Discipline and Discord in the Labour Party: The Politics of Managerial Control in the Labour Party, 1951–87, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988, p.218-90 and Michael Crick The March of Militant, London: Faber, 1986 Earlier in the year left-wing councils had  |protested_at_Government_restriction_of_their_budgets|Rate-Capping_Rebellion|  by refusing to set budgets, resulting in a budget crisis in the Militant-dominated  |Liverpool_City_Council|Liverpool_City_Council| . Kinnock attacked Militant and their conduct in a speech delivered at the conference:        One Liverpool MP,  |Eric_Heffer|Eric_Heffer| , a member of the NEC left the conference stage in disgust at Kinnocks comments.  In June 1986, the Labour Party finally expelled the deputy leader of Liverpool council, the high-profile Militant supporter  |Derek_Hatton|Derek_Hatton| , who was found guilty of manipulating the rules of the district Labour party . , BBC On This Day, 12 June By 1986, the partys position appeared to strengthen further with excellent local election results and a thorough  |rebranding|Rebranding|  of the party under the direction of Kinnocks director of communications  |Peter_Mandelson|Peter_Mandelson| , as well as seizing the  |Fulham|Fulham|  seat in  |West_London|West_London|  from the Conservatives in an April by-election.  Labour, now sporting a continental  |social_democratic|Social_Democracy|  style emblem of a  |rose|Rose|  , appeared to be able to run the governing  |Conservatives|Conservative_Party|  close, but  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  did not let Labours makeover go unchallenged.     The Conservatives 1986 conference was well-managed, and effectively relaunched the Conservatives as a party of radical  |free-market|Free-Market| |economic_liberalism|Economic_Liberalism| . Labour suffered from a persistent image of extremism, especially as Kinnocks campaign to root out Militant dragged on as figures on the  |hard_left|Hard_Left|  of the party tried to stop its progress. Opinion polls showed that voters favoured retaining the  |United_Kingdoms_nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapons_And_The_United_Kingdom| , , and believed that the Conservatives would be better than Labour at defending the country. Anthony King , British Political Opinion, 1937–2000: The Gallup Polls , pp. 105–7.       In early 1987, Labour lost a by-election in Greenwich to the  |SDPs|Social_Democratic_Party| |Rosie_Barnes|Rosie_Barnes| . As a result, Labour faced the  |1987_general_election|1987_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  in some danger of finishing third in the popular vote, with the Conservatives once again expected to secure a comfortable victory. In secret, Labours aim was to secure second place in order to remain as  |Official_Opposition|Official_Opposition| .      Mandelson and his team had revolutionised Labours communications – a transformation symbolised by a  |party_election_broadcast|Party_Election_Broadcast|  popularly known as Kinnock: The Movie .  This was directed by  |Hugh_Hudson|Hugh_Hudson|  and featured Kinnocks 1985 conference speech, and shots of him and his wife Glenys walking on the  |Great_Orme|Great_Orme|  in  |Llandudno|Llandudno|  , and a speech to that years  |Welsh_Labour_Party|Welsh_Labour_Party|  conference asking why he was the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to go to  |university|University| .     On polling day, Labour easily took second place, but with only a 31% share of the vote to the SDP-Liberal Alliances 22%.  Labour was still more than ten percentage points behind the Conservatives, who retained a three-figure majority in the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom| . However, the Conservative governments majority had come down from 144 seats in 1983 to 102.  Significantly, Labour had gained twenty seats at the election.      Labour won extra seats in  |Scotland|Scotland| ,  |Wales|Wales|  and  |Northern_England|Northern_England| , but lost ground particularly in  |Southern_England|Southern_England|  and  |London|London| , where the Conservatives still dominated. The Conservatives also regained the Fulham seat which it had lost to Labour at a by-election just over a year earlier.            A few months after the general election, Kinnock gained brief attention in the  |United_States|United_States|  in August 1987 when it was discovered that then-US Senator  |Joe_Biden|Joe_Biden|  for  |Delaware|Delaware|   plagiarised one of Kinnocks speeches during  |his_1988_presidential_campaign|Joe_Biden_Presidential_Campaign,_1988|  in a speech at a  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party|  debate in  |Iowa|Iowa| .  This led to Bidens withdrawal of his presidential campaign.      The second period of Kinnocks leadership was dominated by his drive to reform the partys policies to gain office. This began with an exercise dubbed the  |policy_review|Policy_Review| , the most high-profile aspect of which was a series of consultations with the public known as  |Labour_Listens|Labour_Listens|  in the autumn of 1987.      After Labour Listens, the party went on, in 1988, to produce a new statement of aims and values—meant to supplement and supplant the formulation of  |Clause_IV|Clause_Iv|  of the partys constitution  and was closely modelled on  |Anthony_Croslands|Anthony_Crosland|  social-democratic thinking—emphasising equality rather than  |public_ownership|State_Ownership| . At the same time, the Labour Partys commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament was dropped, and reforms of Party Conference and the National Executive meant that local parties lost much of their ability to influence policy.     In 1988,  |Kinnock_was_challenged|1988_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  by  |Tony_Benn|Tony_Benn|  for the party leadership. Later many identified this as a particularly low period in Kinnocks leadership — as he appeared mired in internal battles after five years of leadership with the Conservatives still dominating the scene, and being ahead in the opinion polls. In the end, though, Kinnock won a decisive victory over Benn and would soon enjoy a substantial rise in support.      The policy review — reporting in 1989 —coincided with Labours move ahead in the polls as the  |poll_tax|Poll_Tax|  row was destroying Conservative support, and Labour won big victories in local council elections as well as several parliamentary by-elections during 1989 and 1990. Labour overtook the Conservatives at the  |1989_European_elections|1989_European_Parliament_Election_In_The_United_Kingdom| , winning 40% of the vote; the first time Labour had finished in first place at a national election in fifteen years.     In December 1989, he abandoned the Labour policy on  |closed_shops|Closed_Shop| —a decision seen by many as a move away from traditional  |socialist|Socialist|  policies to a more European-wide agenda, and also a move to rid the party of its image of being run by  |trade_unions|Trade_Unions| .      Kinnock was also perceived as scoring in debates over  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  in the  |Commons|British_House_Of_Commons| —previously an area in which he was seen as weak—and finally  |Michael_Heseltine|Michael_Heseltine|  challenged Thatchers leadership and she resigned on 28 November 1990 to be succeeded by then- |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| ,  |John_Major|John_Major| . Kinnock greeted Thatchers resignation by describing it as very good news and demanded an immediate general election.      Public reaction to Majors elevation was highly positive. A new  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and the fact that Kinnock was now the longest-serving current leader of a major party reduced the impact of calls for Time for a Change . Neil Kinnocks showing in the opinion polls dipped; before Thatchers resignation, Labour had been up to 10 points ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls , but many opinion polls were actually showing the Conservatives with a higher amount of support than Labour, in spite of the  |deepening_recession|Early_1990S_Recession| .      By now Militant had finally been routed in the party, and their two MPs were expelled at the end of 1991, in addition to a number of supporters. The majority in the group were now disenchanted with entryism, and choose to function outside Labours ranks, forming the  |Socialist_Party|Socialist_Party| .       In the three years leading up to the  |1992_general_election|1992_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Labour had consistently topped the opinion polls, with 1991 seeing the Conservatives  snatch the lead off Labour more than once before Labour regained it. The rise in Conservative support came in spite of the economic recession and sharp rise in unemployment which affected Britain in 1991.  Since Majors election as  |Leader_of_the_Conservative_Party|Leader_Of_The_Conservative_Party|  , Kinnock had spent the end of 1990  and most of 1991 putting pressure on Major to call a general election that year, but Major had held out and by the autumn he had insisted that there would be no general election in 1991.     Labour had gained four seats from the Conservatives in by-elections since the  |1987_general_election|1987_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , having initially suffered disappointing results in some by-elections, namely a loss of the  |Govan|Govan|  constituency in  |Glasgow|Glasgow|  to the  |Scottish_National_Party|Scottish_National_Party|  in November 1988. However, by the end of 1991, the Conservative majority still stood at 88 seats and Labour needed to win more than ninety new seats to gain an overall majority, although there was still the hope of forming a minority or  |coalition_government|Coalition_Government|  if Labour failed to win a majority.     In the run-up to the election, held on 9 April 1992, most opinion polls had suggested that the election would result in either a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament|  or a narrow Labour majority.      At the  |1992_general_election|1992_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Labour made considerable progress – reducing the Conservatives majority to just 21 seats. It came as a shock to many when the Conservatives won a majority, but the triumphalism perceived by some observers of a Labour Party  |rally_in_Sheffield|Sheffield_Rally|  may have helped put floating voters off. , BBC News, Politics 97 Although internal polls suggested no impact, while public polls suggested a decline in support had already occurred,  most of those directly involved in the campaign believe that the rally really came to widespread attention only after the electoral defeat itself,  with Kinnock himself changing his mind to a rejection of its negative impact over time. Compare Michael Leapman , The Independent, 26 November 1995 with Alyssa McDonald , New Statesman, 29 April 2010     On the day of the general election,  The Sun  newspaper ran a front page featuring Kinnock with the headline If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights .  Kinnock blamed the newspaper in his  |resignation_speech|Resignation_Speech|  for Labour losing the election, along with other  |right-wing|Right-Wing_Politics|  media sections who had backed the Conservatives in the run-up to the election.  The following days headline in The Sun was  |Its_The_Sun_Wot_Won_It|Its_The_Sun_Wot_Won_It|  , which  |Rupert_Murdoch|Rupert_Murdoch| , many years later at his April 2012 appearance before the  |Leveson_Inquiry|Leveson_Inquiry| , stated was both tasteless and wrong and led to the editor  |Kelvin_MacKenzie|Kelvin_Mackenzie|  receiving a reprimand.     The Labour-supporting  Daily Mirror  had backed Kinnock for the 1987 general election  and again in 1992.  Less expected was the  Financial Times  backing Kinnock at the 1992 general election.        Kinnock himself later claimed to have half-expected his defeat at the 1992 general election and proceeded to turn himself into a media personality, even hosting a chat show on  |BBC_Wales|Bbc_Wales|  and twice appearing on the topical panel show  Have I Got News for You  within a year of the defeat. Many years later, he returned to appear as a guest host of the programme.     Kinnock announced his resignation as Labour Party leader on 13 April 1992, ending nearly a decade in the role.  |John_Smith|John_Smith| , previously Shadow Chancellor,  |was_elected|1992_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  on 18 July as his successor.      He remains on the Advisory Council of the  |Institute_for_Public_Policy_Research|Institute_For_Public_Policy_Research| , which he helped set up in the 1980s.     He was an enthusiastic supporter of  |Ed_Milibands|Ed_Miliband|  campaign for leadership of the Labour Party in 2010, and was reported as telling activists, when Miliband won, Weve got our party back – although Miliband, like Kinnock, failed to lead the party back into government, and resigned after the Conservatives were re-elected with a slim majority in  |2015|2015_United_Kingdom_General_Election| .      In 2011, he participated in the family history TV programme  Coming Home  where he discovered hitherto unknown information about his family.             Kinnock was appointed one of the UKs two members of the  |European_Commission|European_Commission| , which he served first as Transport Commissioner under President  |Jacques_Santer|Jacques_Santer| , in early 1995; marking the end of his 25 years in the House of Commons.  This came less than a year after the death of his successor,  |John_Smith|John_Smith|  and the election of  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  as the partys new leader.      He was obliged to resign as part of the forced, collective  |resignation_of_the_Commission|Santer_Commissionresignation|  in 1999. He was re-appointed to the Commission under new President  |Romano_Prodi|Romano_Prodi| . He now became one of the Vice-Presidents of the European Commission, with responsibility for Administrative Reform and the Audit, Linguistics and Logistics Directorates General.  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref nameagnostic1  /ref  ref nameatheist1  /ref ref nameatheist2  /ref  ref .
