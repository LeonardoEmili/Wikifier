      The Baroque  is a highly ornate and often extravagant  |style|Style|  of  |architecture|Baroque_Architecture| ,  |music|Baroque_Music| ,  |dance|Baroque_Dance| ,  |painting|Baroque_Painting| ,  |sculpture|Baroque_Sculpture|  and other arts that flourished in Europe from the early 17th century until the 1740s. In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the decade of 1800s. It followed  |Renaissance_art|Renaissance_Art|  and  |Mannerism|Mannerism|  and preceded the  |Rococo|Rococo|  and  |Neoclassical|Neoclassicism|  styles. It was encouraged by the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of  |Protestant|Protestant|  architecture, art and music, though  |Lutheran_Baroque_art|Lutheran_Artbaroque_Period|  developed in parts of Europe as well.      The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany and Russia. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called  rocaille  or  Rococo , which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.       The English word baroque comes directly from the French, and may have been adapted from the Portuguese term barroco, a flawed pearl. Both words are also related to the Spanish term berruca   or barrueco.       The term did not originally describe a style of music or art. Prior to the 18th century, the French baroque and Portuguese barroco were terms exclusively related to jewellery. An example from 1531 uses the term to describe pearls in an inventory of  |Charles_Vs|Charles_V_Of_France|  treasures. , Rowman & Littlefield, 2015,  Later, the word appears in a 1694 edition of Le Dictionnaire de lAcadémie Française, which describes baroque as only used for pearls that are imperfectly round. se dit seulement des perles qui sont dune rondeur fort imparfaite.  A 1728 Portuguese dictionary similarly describes barroco as relating to a coarse and uneven pearl.      The French term for the artistic style may also have had roots in the medieval Latin word  |baroco|Baroco| , a philosophical term which was invented in the 13th century by  |scholastics|Scholastics|  to describe a particularly complicated type of  |syllogism|Syllogism| , or logical argument. In the 16th century the philosopher  |Michel_de_Montaigne|Michel_De_Montaigne|  associated the term baroco with Bizarre and uselessly complicated.      In the 18th century, the term was also used to describe music, and was not flattering. In an anonymous satirical review of the première of  |Jean-Philippe_Rameaus|Jean-Philippe_Rameau|   Hippolyte et Aricie  in October 1733, which was printed in the  Mercure de France  in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was du barocque , complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device. Claude V. Palisca, Baroque . The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by  |Stanley_Sadie|Stanley_Sadie|  and  |John_Tyrrell|John_Tyrrell|  .     In 1762, Le Dictionnaire de lAcadémie Française wrote that the term could be used figuratively to describe something irregular, bizarre or unequal. se dit aussi au figuré, pour irrégulier, bizarre, inégale.       |Jean-Jacques_Rousseau|Jean-Jacques_Rousseau| , who was a musician and composer as well as philosopher, wrote in 1768 in the  Encyclopédie Encyclopedie; Lettre sur la Musique Francaise under the direction of  |Denis_Diderot|Denis_Diderot|      In 1788, the term was defined by  |Quatremère_de_Quincy|Quatremère_De_Quincy|  in the  Encyclopédie Méthodique  as an architectural style that is highly adorned and tormented . Quatremère de Quincy, Encyclopédie Méthodique, Architecture, volume 1, cited by , B. Migliorini, Manierismo, baròcco, rococò, Rome, 1962, p. 46     The terms style baroque and musique baroque appeared in Le Dictionnaire de lAcadémie Française in 1835. By the mid-19th century, art critics and historians had adopted the term as a way to ridicule post-Renaissance art. This was the sense of the word as used in 1855 by the leading art historian Jacob Burkhardt, who wrote that baroque artists despised and abused detail because they lacked respect for tradition.     Alternatively, a derivation from the name of the Italian painter Federico Barocci has been suggested. : But Klein suggests the name may be from Italian painter Federico Barocci , whose work influenced the style.     In 1888, the art historian Heinrich Wölfflin published the first serious academic work on the style, Renaissance und Barock, which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque. Hopkins, Owen, Les Styles en Architecture , p. 70         thu ceiling of the Church of the Jesu, Rome, by Giovanni Battista Gaulli   The Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent in 1545–63, in response to the Protestant Reformation . The first phase of the Counter-Reformation had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers. The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement. Hughes, J. Quentin . Melitensiawath. Retrieved 8 July 2016. pp. 104–110. Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, Gardners Art Through the Ages , p. 516. Lutheran Baroque art developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the Great Iconoclasm of Calvinist s.     Baroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth, The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven. Ducher, pg. 102   Another feature of baroque churches are the quadratura; trompe-lœil paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. Quadratura paintings of Atlantes below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church. Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective, to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real.     The interiors of baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque, and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome. The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the Chair of Saint Peter and the Baldachino of St. Peter , both by Gian Lorenzo Bernini , in St. Peters Basilica in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy. Ducher p. 106-107 The Dresden Frauenkirche serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter’s in Rome .     The twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light.   The cartouche was another characteristic feature of baroque decoration. These were large plaques carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels. Ducher , pg. 102     Baroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions. For the Palazzo Spada in Rome, Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician.       thu   The first building in Rome to have a Baroque facade was the Church of the Gesù in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance facades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented.     In Rome in 1605, Paul V became the first of series of popes who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colors and dramatic effects. Cabanne page 12 Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the facade of St. Peters Basilica , and the new nave and loggia which connected the facade to Michelangelos dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide facade, and the contrast on the facade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico. Ducher     In the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes Urban VIII and Alexander VII . The sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peters Square . The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theater. Ducher p. 104.     thu , Venice     Another major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was Francesco Borromini , whose major work was the Church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains . The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome.     Painted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and trompe-lœil architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included The Entry of Saint Ignace into Paradise by Andrea Pozzo in the Church of Saint Ignatius in Rome, and The triumph of the name of Jesus by Giovanni Battista Gaulli in the Church of the Gesù in Rome , which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts. Cabanne page 15   The style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy: It appeared in Venice in the church of Santa Maria della Salute by Baldassare Longhena , a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola. It appeared also in Turin, notably in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud by Guarino Guarini . The style also began to be used in palaces; Guarini designed the Palazzo Carignano in Turin, while Longhena designed the Ca Rezzonico on the Grand Canal , , finished by Giorgio Massari with decorated with paintings by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . Cabanne , pages 18–19. A series of massive earthquakes in Sicily required the rebuilding of most of them and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style.         thu by Fernando de Casas Novoa   The Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque architecture. The first major work in the style was the San Isidro Chapel in Madrid , begun in 1643 by Pedro de la Torre . It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery. Cabanne page 48-49 The Cathedral in Santiago de Compostela was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly-ornate bell tower , then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the Obradorio, added between 1738 and 1750 by Fernando de Casas Novoa . Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the Palace of San Telmo in Seville by Leonardo de Figueroa . Cabanne pgs. 48–51     thu , Seville     Granada had only been liberated from the Moors in the 15th century, and had its own distinct variety of Baroque. The painter, sculptor and architect Alonso Cano designed the Baroque interior of Granada Cathedral between 1652 and his death in 1657. It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor.     The most and ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the Spanish Baroque is called Churrigueresque style, named after the brothers Churriguera , who worked primarily in Salamanca and Madrid. Their works include the buildings on the citys main square, the Plaza Mayor of Salamanca . This highly ornamental Baroque style was very influential in many churches and cathedrals built by the Spanish in the Americas.     Other notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include Pedro de Ribera , a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Royal Hospice of San Fernando in Madrid, and Narciso Tomé , who designed the celebrated El Transparente altarpiece at Toledo Cathedral which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards.     The architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain; their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The Church built by the Jesuits for a college in Tepotzotlán , with its ornate Baroque facade and tower, is a good example.
