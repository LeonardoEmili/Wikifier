               The acre is a  |unit|Unit_Of_Measurement|  of land area used in the  |imperial|Imperial_Units|  and  |US_customary|United_States_Customary_Unitsunits_Of_Area|  systems. It is traditionally defined as the area of one  |chain|Chain|  by one  |furlong|Furlong|  , which is exactly equal to 10 square chains,  of a square mile, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047  m 2 , or about 40% of a  |hectare|Hectare| . Based upon the  |International_yard_and_pound_agreement_of_1959|International_Yard_And_Pound| , an acre may be declared as exactly   square metres.     The acre is a  |statute_measure|Statute_Measure|  in the  |United_States|United_States|  and in the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  and almost all countries of the former  |British_Empire|British_Empire| , although informal use continues.     In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but they differ by only two parts per million: see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land.     Traditionally, in the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , an acre was defined as the area of land that could be  |plough|Plough| ed in one day by a  yoke  of  |ox|Ox| en.        One acre equals     square mile, 4,840  square yards, 43,560 square feet National Institute of Standards and Technology   or about  . While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840  square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends upon the particular yard on which it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a  |selion|Selion|  of land sized at forty  |perches|Rod|   long and four perches wide;  this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day . A  |square|Square|  enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57  yards, or 208  feet 9  inches  on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560  square feet is an acre.       In the  |international_yard_and_pound|International_Yard_And_Pound|  agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144  metre. National Bureau of Standards. . . By inference, an international acre may be declared as exactly   square metres but it does not have a basis in any international agreement.     Both the international acre and the US survey acre contain  of a square mile or 4,840  square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used , so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about 4,046.872 square metres; its exact value  is based on an inch defined by 1  metre 39.37  inches exactly, as established by the  |Mendenhall_Order|Mendenhall_Order| . Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.  |National_Geodetic_Survey|National_Geodetic_Survey| , , .     Since the difference between the US survey acre and international acre , is only about a quarter of the size of an  |A4_sheet|Iso_216A_Series|  or  |US_letter|Paper_Sizenorth_American_Paper_Sizes| , it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.  . Federick, MD: American Congress on Surveying and Mapping. 2011.       The  |Puerto_Rica|Puerto_Rica| n  cuerda   is sometimes called the Spanish Acre on the continental United States.  Russ Rowlett. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.       The acre is commonly used in a number of current and former Commonwealth countries by custom, and in a few it continues as a  |statute_measure|Statute_Measure| . These include Antigua and Barbuda,   |American_Samoa|American_Samoa| ,   |The_Bahamas|The_Bahamas| ,  Belize,  the  |British_Virgin_Islands|British_Virgin_Islands| ,  the  |Cayman_Islands|Cayman_Islands| ,   |Canada|Canada| ,   |Dominica|Dominica| ,  the  |Falkland_Islands|Falkland_Islands| ,   |Grenada|Grenada| ,   |Ghana|Ghana| ,   |Guam|Guam| ,  the  |Northern_Mariana_Islands|Northern_Mariana_Islands| ,   |Jamaica|Jamaica| ,   |Montserrat|Montserrat| ,   |Samoa|Samoa| ,   |Saint_Lucia|Saint_Lucia| ,   |St_Helena|St_Helena| ,   |St_Kitts_and_Nevis|St_Kitts_And_Nevis| ,   |St_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines|St_Vincent_And_The_Grenadines| ,   |Turks_and_Caicos|Turks_And_Caicos| ,  the United Kingdom, the United States and the  |US_Virgin_Islands|Us_Virgin_Islands| .        In India, residential plots are measured in square feet while agricultural land is measured in acres. In Sri Lanka, the division of an acre into 160  |perches|Perch|  or 4  |roods|Rood|  is common.     In Sindh , residential plots as well as open/agriculture land measurement is in Acres, Jareb, Wiswa and Gunta.          Its use as a primary unit for trade in the United Kingdom ceased to be permitted from 1 October 1995, due to the 1994 amendment of the  |Weights_and_Measures_Act|Weights_And_Measures_Act_1985| ,  HM Government, 1995 where it was replaced by the  |hectare|Hectare|   though its use as a supplementary unit continues to be permitted indefinitely.  This was with exemption of  |Land_registration|Land_Registration| , which records the sale and possession of land,  in 2010  |HM_Land_Registry|Hm_Land_Registry|  ended its exemption. The measure is still used to communicate with the public,   |Waddesdon_Manor|Waddesdon_Manor|  Estate and informally by the farming and property industries.             1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:   0.40468564224  hectare   4,046.8564224  square metres     1 United States survey acre is equal to:   0.404687261  hectare   4,046.87261  square metres     1  acre is equal to the following customary units:   66  feet × 660  feet   10 square  |chains|Chain|     1  acre is approximately 208.71  feet × 208.71  feet   4,840  square yards   43,560 square feet   160  |perches|Perch| .
