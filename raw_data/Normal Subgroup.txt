   In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , a normal subgroup is a  |subgroup|Subgroup|  that is invariant under  |conjugation|Inner_Automorphism|  by members of the  |group|Group|  of which it is a part. In other words, a subgroup  of the group  is normal in  if and only if  for all  and . The usual notation for this relation is N   G .     Normal subgroups are important because they can be used to construct  |quotient_groups|Quotient_Group|  of the given group. Furthermore, the normal subgroups of  are precisely the  |kernels|Kernel_Of_A_Homomorphism|  of  |group_homomorphisms|Group_Homomorphism|  with domain , which means that they can be used to internally classify those homomorphisms.      |Évariste_Galois|Évariste_Galois|  was the first to realize the importance of the existence of normal subgroups.       A  |subgroup|Subgroup|   of a group  is called a normal subgroup of  if it is invariant under  |conjugation|Inner_Automorphism| ; that is, the conjugation of an element of  by an element of  is always in . The usual notation for this relation is N   G , and the definition may be written in symbols as   N   G     n  N,   g  G  gng  N.       For any subgroup  of , the following conditions are  |equivalent|Logical_Equivalence|  to  being a normal subgroup of . Therefore, any one of them may be taken as the definition:     Any two elements commute regarding the normal subgroup membership relation: .   The image of conjugation of  by any element of  is a subset of .   The image of conjugation of  by any element of  is . .  |cosets|Coset|  of  in  coincide.  with respect to  and an element of the left coset of  with respect to  is an element of the left coset of  with respect to , if  and  then .    is a  |union|Union|  of  |conjugacy_class|Conjugacy_Class| es of .  is preserved by  |inner_automorphisms|Inner_Automorphism| .  |commutator|Commutator|  ngng is in .  |group_homomorphism|Group_Homomorphism|   whose  |kernel|Kernel|  is . consisting of just the identity element of  and  itself are always normal subgroups of . If these are the only normal subgroups, then  is said to be  |simple|Simple_Group| .  |translation_group|Translation_Group|  is a normal subgroup of the  |Euclidean_group|Euclidean_Group|  in any dimension. This means: applying a rigid transformation, followed by a translation and then the inverse rigid transformation, has the same effect as a single translation . By contrast, the subgroup of all  |rotations|Rotation|  about the origin is not a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group, as long as the dimension is at least 2: first translating, then rotating about the origin, and then translating back will typically not fix the origin and will therefore not have the same effect as a single rotation about the origin.   Every subgroup  of an  |abelian_group|Abelian_Group|   is normal, because . A group that is not abelian but for which every subgroup is normal is called a  |Hamiltonian_group|Hamiltonian_Group| .  |center_of_a_group|Center|  is a normal subgroup.  |commutator_subgroup|Commutator_Subgroup|  is a normal subgroup.  |characteristic_subgroup|Characteristic_Subgroup|  is normal, since conjugation is always an  |automorphism|Automorphism| .  |Rubiks_Cube_group|Rubiks_Cube_Group| , the subgroups consisting of operations which only affect the orientations of either the corner pieces or the edge pieces are normal.  is a normal subgroup of , and  is a subgroup of  containing , then  is a normal subgroup of .  |transitive_relation|Transitive_Relation| . The smallest group exhibiting this phenomenon is the  |dihedral_group|Dihedral_Group|  of order 8. However, a  |characteristic_subgroup|Characteristic_Subgroup|  of a normal subgroup is normal. A group in which normality is transitive is called a  |T_group|T_Group| .  and  are normal subgroups of their  |direct_product|Direct_Product_Of_Groups|  .   If the group  is a  |semidirect_product|Semidirect_Product|  G N   H, , then  is normal in , though  need not be normal in .   Normality is preserved under surjective homomorphisms, i.e. if  is a surjective group homomorphism and  is normal in , then the image  is normal in .   Normality is preserved by taking  |inverse_images|Inverse_Image| , i.e. if  is a group homomorphism and  is normal in , then the inverse image  is normal in .   Normality is preserved on taking  |direct_products|Direct_Product_Of_Groups| , i.e. if N1   G1 and N2   G2 , then N1  N2      G2 .   Every subgroup of  |index|Index|  2 is normal. More generally, a subgroup, , of finite index, , in  contains a subgroup, , normal in  and of index dividing  called the  |normal_core|Normal_Core| . In particular, if  is the smallest prime dividing the order of , then every subgroup of index  is normal.  are precisely the kernels of group homomorphisms defined on G accounts for some of the importance of normal subgroups; they are a way to internally classify all homomorphisms defined on a group. For example, a non-identity finite group is  |simple|Simple_Group|  if and only if it is isomorphic to all of its non-identity homomorphic images, a finite group is  |perfect|Perfect_Group|  if and only if it has no normal subgroups of prime  |index|Index_Of_A_Subgroup| , and a group is  |imperfect|Imperfect_Group|  if and only if the  |derived_subgroup|Derived_Subgroup|  is not supplemented by any proper normal subgroup.       Given two normal subgroups,  and , of , their intersection N  M and their product N M   are also normal subgroups of .     The normal subgroups of  form a  |lattice|Lattice|  under  |subset_inclusion|Subset_Inclusion|  with  |least_element|Least_Element| , , and  |greatest_element|Greatest_Element| , . The  |meet|Meet|  of two normal subgroups,  and , in this lattice is their intersection and the  |join|Join|  is their product.     The lattice is  |complete|Complete_Lattice|  and  |modular|Modular_Lattice| .         If  is a normal subgroup, we can define a multiplication on cosets as follows: : N. This relation defines a mapping G/N  G/N  G/N . To show that this mapping is well-defined, one needs to prove that the choice of representative elements a1, a2 does not affect the result. To this end, consider some other representative elements a1  a1 N, a2  a2 N . Then there are n1, n2  N such that a1a1 n1, a2a2 n2 . It follows that a1 a2 N a1 n1 a2 n2 N a1 a2 n1 n2 Na1 a2 N, where we also used the fact that N is a normal subgroup, and therefore there is n1  N such that n1 a2 a2 n1 . This proves that this product is a well-defined mapping between cosets.     With this operation, the set of cosets is itself a group, called the  |quotient_group|Quotient_Group|  and denoted with . There is a natural  |homomorphism|Group_Homomorphism| , , given by . This homomorphism maps N into the identity element of , which is the coset , that is,   .     In general, a group homomorphism,  sends subgroups of  to subgroups of . Also, the preimage of any subgroup of  is a subgroup of . We call the preimage of the trivial group  in  the  kernel  of the homomorphism and denote it by . As it turns out, the kernel is always normal and the image of , , is always  |isomorphic|Isomorphic|  to  . In fact, this correspondence is a bijection between the set of all quotient groups of , , and the set of all homomorphic images of  . It is also easy to see that the kernel of the quotient map, , is  itself, so the normal subgroups are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms with  |domain|Domain|  .
