Oscillation is the repetitive variation, typically in  |time|Time| , of some measure about a central value  or between two or more different states. The term  vibration  is precisely used to describe mechanical oscillation. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging  |pendulum|Pendulum|  and  |alternating_current|Alternating_Current| .     Oscillations occur not only in mechanical systems but also in  |dynamic_systems|Dynamic_System|  in virtually every area of science: for example the beating of the  |human_heart|Human_Heart|  ,  |business_cycles|Business_Cycle|  in  |economics|Economics| ,  |predator–prey|Predator–Prey|  population cycles in  |ecology|Ecology| , geothermal  |geysers|Geyser|  in  |geology|Geology| , vibration of strings in  |guitar|Guitar|  and other  |string_instruments|String_Instrument| , periodic firing of  |nerve_cells|Nerve_Cell|  in the brain, and the periodic swelling of  |Cepheid_variable|Cepheid_Variable|  stars in  |astronomy|Astronomy| .            The simplest mechanical oscillating system is a  |weight|Weight|  attached to a  |linear|Linear| |spring|Spring|  subject to only  |weight|Weight|  and  |tension|Tension| . Such a system may be approximated on an air table or ice surface. The system is in an  |equilibrium|Mechanical_Equilibrium|  state when the spring is static. If the system is displaced from the equilibrium, there is a net restoring force on the mass, tending to bring it back to equilibrium. However, in moving the mass back to the equilibrium position, it has acquired  |momentum|Momentum|  which keeps it moving beyond that position, establishing a new restoring force in the opposite sense. If a constant  |force|Force|  such as  |gravity|Gravity|  is added to the system, the point of equilibrium is shifted. The time taken for an oscillation to occur is often referred to as the oscillatory period.     The systems where the restoring force on a body is directly proportional to its displacement, such as the  |dynamics|Dynamics|  of the spring-mass system, are described mathematically by the  |simple_harmonic_oscillator|Harmonic_Oscillatorsimple_Harmonic_Oscillator|  and the regular  |periodic|Period|  motion is known as  |simple_harmonic_motion|Simple_Harmonic_Motion| . In the spring-mass system, oscillations occur because, at the  |static|Statics|  equilibrium displacement, the mass has  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  which is converted into  |potential_energy|Potential_Energy|  stored in the spring at the extremes of its path. The spring-mass system illustrates some common features of oscillation, namely the existence of an equilibrium and the presence of a restoring force which grows stronger the further the system deviates from equilibrium.            All real-world oscillator systems are  |thermodynamically_irreversible|Thermodynamic_Reversibility| . This means there are dissipative processes such as  |friction|Friction|  or  |electrical_resistance|Electrical_Resistance|  which continually convert some of the energy stored in the oscillator into heat in the environment. This is called damping. Thus, oscillations tend to decay with time unless there is some net source of energy into the system. The simplest description of this decay process can be illustrated by oscillation decay of the harmonic oscillator.          In addition, an oscillating system may be subject to some external force, as when an AC  |circuit|Electronic_Circuit|  is connected to an outside power source. In this case the oscillation is said to be  driven .     Some systems can be excited by energy transfer from the environment. This transfer typically occurs where systems are embedded in some  |fluid|Fluid|  flow. For example, the phenomenon of  |flutter|Aeroelastic_Flutter|  in  |aerodynamics|Aerodynamics|  occurs when an arbitrarily small displacement of an  |aircraft|Aircraft| |wing|Wing|  results in an increase in the  |angle_of_attack|Angle_Of_Attack|  of the wing on the air flow and a consequential increase in  |lift_coefficient|Coefficient_Of_Lift| , leading to a still greater displacement. At sufficiently large displacements, the  |stiffness|Stiffness|  of the wing dominates to provide the restoring force that enables an oscillation.             The harmonic oscillator and the systems it models have a single  |degree_of_freedom|Degrees_Of_Freedom| . More complicated systems have more degrees of freedom, for example two masses and three springs . In such cases, the behavior of each variable influences that of the others. This leads to a coupling of the oscillations of the individual degrees of freedom. For example, two pendulum clocks mounted on a common wall will tend to synchronise. This  |phenomenon|Odd_Sympathy|  was first observed by  |Christiaan_Huygens|Christiaan_Huygens|  in 1665. Strogatz, Steven. Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order. Hyperion, 2003, pp 106-109 The apparent motions of the compound oscillations typically appears very complicated but a more economic, computationally simpler and conceptually deeper description is given by resolving the motion into  |normal_modes|Normal_Mode| .     More special cases are the coupled oscillators where energy alternates between two forms of oscillation. Well-known is the  |Wilberforce_pendulum|Wilberforce_Pendulum| , where the oscillation alternates between an elongation of a vertical spring and the rotation of an object at the end of that spring.     Coupled oscillators is a common description of two related, but different phenomena. One case is where both oscillations affect each other mutually, which usually leads to the occurrence of a single, entrained oscillation state, where both oscillate with a compromise frequency. Another case is where one external oscillation affects an internal oscillation, but is not affected by this. In this case the regions of synchronization, known as Arnold tongues. The latter case can lead to highly complex phenomena as for instance chaotic dynamics.          As the number of degrees of freedom becomes arbitrarily large, a system approaches  |continuity|Continuum_Mechanics| ; examples include a string or the surface of a body of  |water|Water| . Such systems have  an  |infinite|Infinity|  number of normal modes and their oscillations occur in the form of waves that can characteristically propagate.             The mathematics of oscillation deals with the quantification of the amount that a sequence or function tends to move between extremes. There are several related notions: oscillation of a  |sequence|Sequence|  of  |real_numbers|Real_Number| , oscillation of a real valued  |function|Function|  at a point, and oscillation of a function on an  |interval|Interval|  .                |Double_pendulum|Double_Pendulum| |Foucault_pendulum|Foucault_Pendulum| |Helmholtz_resonator|Helmholtz_Resonance| |helioseismology|Helioseismology| |asteroseismology|Asteroseismology| |Tickler_or_Meissn|Tickler_Or_Meissn|                    oscillation of  |electromagnetic_field|Electromagnetic_Field|  with frequency of order 10 15  Hzpulsation of output power of  |laser|Laser|  at frequencies 10 4  Hz   10 6  Hz in the transient regime                             |llularautomat|Llularautomat|.
