The son of the popular Roman general  |Germanicus|Germanicus|  and  |Augustuss|Augustus|  granddaughter  |Agrippina_the_Elder|Agrippina_The_Elder| , Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , conventionally known as the  |Julio-Claudian_dynasty|Julio-Claudian_Dynasty| . Germanicuss uncle and adoptive father,  |Tiberius|Tiberius| , succeeded Augustus as emperor of  |Rome|Ancient_Rome|  in 14 AD.     Although he was born Gaius Caesar, after  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar| , he acquired the nickname Caligula  from his fathers soldiers during their campaign in  |Germania|Germania| . When Germanicus died at  |Antioch|Antioch|  in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Untouched by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted an invitation in 31 to join the emperor on the island of  |Capri|Capri| , where Tiberius had withdrawn five years earlier. Following the death of Tiberius, Caligula succeeded his adoptive grandfather as emperor in 37.     There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, although he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane  |tyrant|Tyrant| . While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the  |principate|Principate| . He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and initiated the construction of two  |aqueducts|Roman_Aqueduct|  in Rome: the  |Aqua_Claudia|Aqua_Claudia|  and the  |Anio_Novus|Anio_Novus| . During his reign, the empire annexed the  |client_kingdom|Client_State|  of  |Mauretania|Mauretania|  as a  |province|Roman_Mauretania| .     In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the  |Praetorian_Guard|Praetorian_Guard| ,  |senators|Roman_Senate| , and courtiers. The conspirators attempt to use the opportunity to restore the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic|  was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligulas uncle,  |Claudius|Claudius| , the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of his nephew  |Nero|Nero|  in 68, Caligulas death marked the official end of the  |Julii_Caesares|Julii_Caesares|  in the male line.          :See Julio-Claudian family tree .            Gaius Julius Caesar  was born in  |Antium|Antium|   on 31 August 12 AD, the third of six surviving children born to  |Germanicus|Germanicus|  and his second cousin  |Agrippina_the_Elder|Agrippina_The_Elder| . Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula .

He was also a nephew of  |Claudius|Claudius| , Germanicus younger brother and the future emperor. Cassius Dio, Roman History .     Agrippina the Elder was the daughter of  |Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa|Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa|  and  |Julia_the_Elder|Julia_The_Elder| . She was a granddaughter of  |Augustus|Augustus|  and  |Scribonia|Scribonia|  on her mothers side. Through Agrippina, Augustus was the maternal great-grandfather of Gaius.     As a boy of just two or three, Gaius accompanied his father,  |Germanicus|Germanicus| , on campaigns in the north of  |Germania|Germania| . Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula The soldiers were amused that Gaius was dressed in a miniature soldiers outfit, including boots and armour. He was soon given his nickname Caligula, meaning little boot in Latin, after the small boots he wore. Caligula is formed from the Latin word caliga, meaning soldiers boot, and the diminutive infix -ul. Gaius, though, reportedly grew to dislike this nickname. Seneca the Younger, On the Firmness of a Wise Person XVIII 2–5. See Malloch, Gaius and the nobiles, Athenaeum .     Suetonius claims that Germanicus was poisoned in Syria by an agent of Tiberius , who viewed Germanicus as a political rival. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula     After the death of his father, Caligula lived with his mother until her relations with Tiberius deteriorated. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Tiberius would not allow Agrippina to remarry for fear her husband would be a rival. Tacitus, Annals IV.52 . Agrippina and Caligulas brother, Nero , were banished in 29 on charges of treason. Tacitus, Annals V.3 . Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius     The adolescent Caligula was then sent to live with his great-grandmother Livia . After her death, he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia Minor . In 30, his brother, Drusus Caesar , was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide. Tacitus, Annals V.10 . Suetonius writes that after the banishment of his mother and brothers, Caligula and his sisters were nothing more than prisoners of Tiberius under the close watch of soldiers. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius     In 31, Caligula was remanded to the personal care of Tiberius on Capri , where he lived for six years. To the surprise of many, Caligula was spared by Tiberius. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius According to historians, Caligula was an excellent natural actor and, recognizing danger, hid all his resentment towards Tiberius. Tacitus, Annals VI.20 . An observer said of Caligula, Never was there a better servant or a worse master!     Caligula claimed to have planned to kill Tiberius with a dagger in order to avenge his mother and brother: however, having brought the weapon into Tiberiuss bedroom he did not kill the Emperor but instead threw the dagger down on the floor. Supposedly Tiberius knew of this but never dared to do anything about it. The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Suetonius claims that Caligula was already cruel and vicious: he writes that, when Tiberius brought Caligula to Capri, his purpose was to allow Caligula to live in order that he prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was rearing a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world. The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula     In 33, Tiberius gave Caligula an honorary quaestor ship, a position he held until his rise to emperor. Cassius Dio, Roman History Meanwhile, both Caligulas mother and his brother Drusus died in prison. Tacitus, Annals VI.25 . Tacitus, Annals VI.23 . Caligula was briefly married to Junia Claudilla , in 33, though she died in childbirth the following year. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian prefect, Naevius Sutorius Macro , an important ally. Macro spoke well of Caligula to Tiberius, attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor felt towards Caligula. Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius VI.35 .     In 35, Caligula was named joint heir to Tiberiuss estate along with Tiberius Gemellus . Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius           When Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD, his estate and the titles of the principate were left to Caligula and Tiberiuss own grandson, Gemellus , who were to serve as joint heirs. Although Tiberius was 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still conjecture that he was murdered. Tacitus, Annals XII.53 . Tacitus writes that the Praetorian Prefect , Macro , smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligulas accession, much to the joy of the Roman people, while Suetonius writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian. Seneca the Elder and Philo , who both wrote during Tiberiuss reign, as well as Josephus , record Tiberius as dying a natural death. Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius IV.25 ; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIII.6.9. Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberiuss will nullified with regard to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberiuss wishes. Cassius Dio, Roman History     thu , 1647   Caligula accepted the powers of the principate as conferred by the Senate and entered Rome on 28 March amid a crowd that hailed him as our baby and our star , among other nicknames. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Caligula is described as the first emperor who was admired by everyone in all the world, from the rising to the setting sun. Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II.10 . Caligula was loved by many for being the beloved son of the popular Germanicus , and because he was not Tiberius . Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius Suetonius said that over 160,000 animals were sacrificed during three months of public rejoicing to usher in the new reign. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Philo mentions widespread sacrifice, but no estimation on the degree, Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II.12 . Philo describes the first seven months of Caligulas reign as completely blissful. Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II.13 .     Caligulas first acts were said to be generous in spirit, though many were political in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard , city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberiuss treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus. Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.3.   thu   In October 37, Caligula fell seriously ill, or perhaps was poisoned. He soon recovered from his illness, but many believed that the illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness reminded him of his mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place. Dunstan, William E., Ancient Rome, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2010, , p.285. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligulas and Gemelluss mutual grandmother Antonia Minor . She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as a laughing stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger , were exiled. He hated being the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder . The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula       In 38, Caligula focused his attention on political and public reform. He published the accounts of public funds, which had not been made public during the reign of Tiberius. He aided those who lost property in fires, abolished certain taxes, and gave out prizes to the public at gymnastic events. He allowed new members into the equestrian and senatorial orders. Cassius Dio, Roman History     Perhaps most significantly, he restored the practice of democratic elections. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Cassius Dio said that this act though delighting the rabble, grieved the sensible, who stopped to reflect, that if the offices should fall once more into the hands of the many  ... many disasters would result . Cassius Dio, Roman History     During the same year, though, Caligula was criticized for executing people without full trials and for forcing the Praetorian prefect, Macro, to commit suicide. Macro had fallen out of favor with the emperor, probably due to an attempt to ally himself with Gemellus when it appeared that Caligula might die of fever. Cassius Dio, Roman History       According to Cassius Dio , a financial crisis emerged in 39. Suetonius places the beginning of this crisis in 38. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Caligulas political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the states treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula     Historians describe a number of Caligulas other desperate measures. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula He levied taxes on lawsuits, weddings and prostitution. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula Caligula began auctioning the lives of the gladiators at shows. Cassius Dio, Roman History Wills that left items to Tiberius were reinterpreted to leave the items instead to Caligula. Cassius Dio, Roman History Centurions who had acquired property by plunder were forced to turn over spoils to the state.     The current and past highway commissioners were accused of incompetence and embezzlement and forced to repay money. According to Suetonius, in the first year of Caligulas reign he squandered 2.7  billion sesterces that Tiberius had amassed. The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula His nephew Nero Caesar both envied and admired the fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius had left him in so short a time. The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero     However, some historians have shown skepticism towards the large number of sesterces quoted by Suetonius and Dio. According to Wilkinson, Caligulas use of precious metals to mint coins throughout his principate indicates that the treasury most likely never fell into bankruptcy. He does point out, however, that it is difficult to ascertain whether the purported squandered wealth was from the treasury alone due to the blurring of the division between the private wealth of the emperor and his income as head of state. Furthermore, Alston points out that Caligulas successor, Claudius , was able to donate 15,000 sesterces to each member of the praetorian guard in 41, suggesting the Roman treasury was solvent.     thu was first brought from Egypt to Rome by Caligula. It was the centerpiece of a large racetrack he built.   A brief famine of unknown extent occurred, perhaps caused by this financial crisis, but Suetonius claims it resulted from Caligulas seizure of public carriages; according to Seneca, grain imports were disrupted because Caligula re-purposed grain boats for a pontoon bridge.
