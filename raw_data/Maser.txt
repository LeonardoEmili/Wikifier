           A maser  is a device that produces  |coherent|Coherence| |electromagnetic_waves|Electromagnetic_Waves|  through amplification by  |stimulated_emission|Stimulated_Emission| . The first maser was built by  |Charles_H._Townes|Charles_H._Townes| ,  |James_P._Gordon|James_P._Gordon| , and  |Herbert_J._Zeiger|Herbert_J._Zeiger|  at Columbia University in 1953. Townes,  |Nikolay_Basov|Nikolay_Basov|  and  |Alexander_Prokhorov|Alexander_Prokhorov|  were awarded the 1964  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  for theoretical work leading to the maser. Masers are used as the timekeeping device in  |atomic_clocks|Atomic_Clock| , and as extremely low-noise microwave  |amplifiers|Amplifier|  in  |radio_telescopes|Radio_Telescope|  and deep space  |spacecraft_communication|Spacecraft_Communication|  ground stations.     Modern masers can be designed to generate  |electromagnetic_waves|Electromagnetic_Wave|  at not only microwave  |frequencies|Frequency|  but also radio and infrared frequencies. For this reason Charles Townes suggested replacing microwave with the word molecular as the first word in the acronym maser.      The  |laser|Laser|  works by the same principle as the maser, but produces higher frequency  |coherent_radiation|Coherence|  at visible wavelengths. The maser was the forerunner of the laser, inspiring theoretical work by Townes and  |Arthur_Leonard_Schawlow|Arthur_Leonard_Schawlow|  that led to the invention of the laser in 1960 by  |Theodore_Maiman|Theodore_Maiman| . When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957, it was originally called the optical maser . This was ultimately changed to  |laser|Laser|  for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation .  |Gordon_Gould|Gordon_Gould|  is credited with creating this acronym in 1957.       The theoretical principles governing the operation of a maser were first described by  |Joseph_Weber|Joseph_Weber|  of the  |University_of_Maryland,_College_Park|University_Of_Maryland,_College_Park|  at the Electron Tube Research Conference in 1952 in  |Ottawa|Ottawa| ,  with a summary published in the June 1953 Transactions of the Institute of Radio Engineers Professional Group on Electron Devices,  and simultaneously by  |Nikolay_Basov|Nikolay_Basov|  and  |Alexander_Prokhorov|Alexander_Prokhorov|  from  |Lebedev_Institute_of_Physics|Lebedev_Physical_Institute|  at an All-Union Conference on Radio-Spectroscopy held by the  |USSR_Academy_of_Sciences|Ussr_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in May 1952, subsequently published in October 1954.     Independently,  |Charles_Hard_Townes|Charles_H._Townes| ,  |James_P._Gordon|James_P._Gordon| , and H. J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at  |Columbia_University|Columbia_University|  in 1953. This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized  |ammonia|Ammonia|  molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0  |gigahertz|Hertz| .  Townes later worked with  |Arthur_L._Schawlow|Arthur_Leonard_Schawlow|  to describe the principle of the optical maser, or laser,  of which  |Theodore_H._Maiman|Theodore_Harold_Maiman|  created the first working model in 1960.     For their research in the field of stimulated emission, Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  in 1964.       The maser is based on the principle of stimulated emission proposed by  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein|  in 1917. When atoms have been induced into an excited energy state, they can amplify radiation at a frequency particular to the element or molecule used as the masing medium .     By putting such an amplifying medium in a  |resonant_cavity|Resonant_Cavity| , feedback is created that can produce  |coherent_radiation|Coherence| .       Atomic beam masers   Ammonia maser   Free electron maser    |Hydrogen_maser|Hydrogen_Maser| |Whispering-gallery_modes|Whispering-Gallery_Wave|  iron-sapphire maser   Dual noble gas maser        In 2012, a research team from the  |National_Physical_Laboratory|National_Physical_Laboratory|  and  |Imperial_College_London|Imperial_College_London|  developed a  |solid-state|Solid-State_Physics|  maser that operated at room temperature by using optically pumped,  |pentacene|Pentacene| -doped  |p-Terphenyl|P-Terphenyl|  as the amplifier medium    . It produced pulses of maser emission lasting for a few hundred microseconds.     In 2018, a research team from  |Imperial_College_London|Imperial_College_London|  and  |University_College_London|University_College_London|  demonstrated continuous-wave maser oscillation using  |synthetic_diamonds|Synthetic_Diamond|  containing  |Nitrogen-Vacancy|Nitrogen-Vacancy_Center|  defects  , phys.org .       Masers serve as high precision  |frequency|Frequency|  references. These atomic frequency standards are one of the many forms of  |atomic_clocks|Atomic_Clock| . Masers were also used as  |low-noise_microwave_amplifiers|Electronic_Amplifier|  in  |radio_telescopes|Radio_Telescope| , though these have largely been replaced by amplifiers based on  |FETs|Field_Effect_Transistor| .      During the early 1960s, the  |Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory|Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory|  developed a maser to provide ultra-low-noise amplification of  |S-band|S-Band|  microwave signals received from deep space probes.  This maser used deeply refrigerated helium to chill the amplifier down to a temperature of four  |kelvin|Kelvin| . Amplification was achieved by exciting a ruby comb with a 12.0 gigahertz  |klystron|Klystron| . In the early years, it took days to chill and remove the impurities from the hydrogen lines. Refrigeration was a two-stage process with a large Linde unit on the ground, and a crosshead compressor within the antenna. The final injection was at  through a  micrometer-adjustable entry to the chamber. The whole system  |noise_temperature|Noise_Temperature|  looking at cold sky  was 17 kelvins. This gave such a low noise figure that the  |Mariner_IV|Mariner_Iv| |space_probe|Space_Probe|  could send still pictures from  |Mars|Mars|  back to the  |Earth|Earth|  even though the output power of its  |radio_transmitter|Radio_Transmitter|  was only 15  |watts|Watt| , and hence the total signal power received was only -169  |decibels|Decibel|  with respect to a  |milliwatt|Milliwatt|  .             The hydrogen maser is used as an  |atomic_frequency_standard|Atomic_Clock| . Together with other kinds of atomic clocks, these help make up the  |International_Atomic_Time|International_Atomic_Time|  standard . This is the international time scale coordinated by the  |International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures|International_Bureau_Of_Weights_And_Measures| .  |Norman_Ramsey|Norman_Ramsey|  and his colleagues first conceived of the maser as a timing standard. More recent masers are practically identical to their original design. Maser oscillations rely on the stimulated emission between two  |hyperfine_energy_levels|Hyperfine_Structure|  of atomic  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| . Here is a brief description of how they work:     First, a beam of atomic hydrogen is produced. This is done by submitting the gas at low pressure to a high-frequency  |radio_wave|Radio_Wave|  discharge .   The next step is state selection —in order to get some stimulated emission, it is necessary to create a  |population_inversion|Population_Inversion|  of the atoms. This is done in a way that is very similar to the  |Stern–Gerlach_experiment|Stern–Gerlach_Experiment| . After passing through an aperture and a magnetic field, many of the atoms in the beam are left in the upper energy level of the lasing transition. From this state, the atoms can decay to the lower state and emit some microwave radiation.   A high  |Q_factor|Q_Factor| |microwave_cavity|Microwave_Cavity|  confines the microwaves and reinjects them repeatedly into the atom beam. The stimulated emission amplifies the microwaves on each pass through the beam. This combination of  |amplification|Amplifier|  and  |feedback|Feedback|  is what defines all  |oscillators|Oscillator| . The  |resonant_frequency|Resonant_Frequency|  of the microwave cavity is tuned to the frequency of the hyperfine energy transition of hydrogen: 1,420,405,752  |hertz|Hertz| .    A small fraction of the signal in the microwave cavity is coupled into a coaxial cable and then sent to a coherent  |radio_receiver|Radio_Receiver| .   The microwave signal coming out of the maser is very weak . The frequency of the signal is fixed and extremely stable. The coherent receiver is used to amplify the signal and change the frequency. This is done using a series of  |phase-locked_loops|Phase-Locked_Loop|  and a high performance  |quartz_oscillator|Quartz_Oscillator| .          Maser-like stimulated emission has also been observed in nature from  |interstellar_space|Interstellar_Space| , and it is frequently called superradiant emission to distinguish it from laboratory masers. Such emission is observed from molecules such as water ,  |hydroxyl|Hydroxyl| |radicals|Radical|  ,  |methanol|Methanol|  ,  |formaldehyde|Formaldehyde|  , and  |silicon_monoxide|Silicon_Monoxide|  . Water molecules in  |star|Star| -forming regions can undergo a  |population_inversion|Population_Inversion|  and emit radiation at about 22.0   |GHz|Ghz| , creating the brightest  |spectral_line|Electromagnetic_Spectrum|  in the radio universe. Some water masers also emit radiation from a  |rotational_transition|Quantum_Rotor_Model|  at a  |frequency|Frequency|  of 96  GHz.       Extremely powerful masers, associated with  |active_galactic_nuclei|Active_Galactic_Nuclei| , are known as  |megamasers|Megamaser|  and are up to a million times more powerful than stellar masers.       The meaning of the term maser has changed slightly since its introduction. Initially the acronym was universally given as microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation , which described devices which emitted in the microwave region of the  |electromagnetic_spectrum|Electromagnetic_Spectrum| .     The principle and concept of stimulated emission has since been extended to more devices and frequencies. Thus, the original acronym is sometimes modified, as suggested by Charles H. Townes, to molecular amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Some have asserted that Towness efforts to extend the acronym in this way were primarily motivated by the desire to increase the importance of his invention, and his reputation in the scientific community.       When the laser was developed, Townes and  |Schawlow|Arthur_Schawlow|  and their colleagues at Bell Labs pushed the use of the term optical maser, but this was largely abandoned in favor of laser, coined by their rival Gordon Gould.  In modern usage, devices that emit in the  |X-ray|X-Ray|  through  |infrared|Infrared|  portions of the spectrum are typically called  |lasers|Laser| , and devices that emit in the microwave region and below are commonly called masers, regardless of whether they emit microwaves or other frequencies.     Gould originally proposed distinct names for devices that emit in each portion of the spectrum, including grasers , xasers , uvasers ,  lasers , irasers , masers , and rasers . Most of these terms never caught on, however, and all have now become obsolete except for maser and laser.
