   Seafood is any form of  |sea_life|Marine_Life|  regarded as  |food|Food|  by humans, prominently including  |fish|Fish_As_Food|  and  |shellfish|Shellfish| . Shellfish include various species of  |molluscs|Mollusca|  ,  |crustaceans|Crustacean|  , and  |echinoderms|Echinoderm|  . Historically,  |marine_mammals|Marine_Mammal|  such as  |cetaceans|Cetacean|   as well as  |seals|Pinniped|  have been eaten as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants such as some  |seaweeds|Edible_Seaweed|  and  |microalgae|Microalgae|  are widely eaten as  |sea_vegetables|:Category:Sea_Vegetables|  around the world, especially in Asia. In North America, although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term seafood is extended to  |fresh_water|Fresh_Water|  organisms eaten by humans, so all edible  |aquatic_life|Aquatic_Life|  may be referred to as seafood . For the sake of completeness, this article is inclusive of all edible aquatic life.     The harvesting of  |wild_seafood|Wild_Fisheries|  is usually known as  |fishing|Fishing|  or  |hunting|Hunting| , while the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as  |aquaculture|Aquaculture|  or  |fish_farming|Fish_Farming|  . Seafood is often colloquially distinguished from  |meat|Meat| , although it is still animal in nature and is excluded from a  |vegetarian|Vegetarianism|  diet, as decided by groups like the  |Vegetarian_Society|Vegetarian_Society|  after confusion surrounding  |pescetarianism|Pescetarianism| . Seafood is an important source of  |protein|Protein|  in many  |diets|Diet|  around the world, especially in coastal areas.     Most of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as  |fish_food|Fish_Food|  to farm other fish or rear  |farm_animals|Farm_Animals| . Some seafoods  are used as food for other plants . In these ways, seafoods are used to produce further food for human consumption. Also, products such as  |fish_oil|Fish_Oil|  and  |spirulina|Spirulina|  tablets are extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is fed to  |aquarium|Aquarium|  fish, or used to feed domestic pets such as  |cats|Cat| . A small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for nonfood purposes .             The harvesting, processing, and consuming of seafoods are ancient practices with archaeological evidence dating back well into the  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic| .  National Geographic News article. Findings in a sea cave at  |Pinnacle_Point|Pinnacle_Point|  in  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  indicate  Homo sapiens  harvested marine life as early as 165,000 years ago,  while the  |Neanderthals|Neanderthal| , an extinct human species contemporary with early Homo sapiens, appear to have been eating seafood at sites along the Mediterranean coast beginning around the same time.  Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of  |Tianyuan_man|Tianyuan_Man| , a 40,000-year-old  |anatomically_modern_human|Anatomically_Modern_Human|  from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish.    PhysOrg.com , 6 July 2009.  |Archaeology|Archaeological|  features such as  |shell_middens|Midden| , . discarded fish bones and  |cave_paintings|Cave_Painting|  show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a  |hunter-gatherer|Hunter-Gatherer|  lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements such as those at  |Lepenski_Vir|Lepenski_Vir| , they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.     The ancient  |river|River| |Nile|Nile|  was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population.  The  |Egyptians|Egyptians|  had implements and methods for fishing and these are illustrated in  |tomb|Tomb|  scenes, drawings, and  |papyrus|Papyrus|  documents. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime.          Fishing scenes are rarely represented in  |ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. However,  |Oppian_of_Corycus|Oppian| , a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood  were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland.  |Sardines|Sardine|  and  |anchovies|Anchovy|  were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of  |Akraiphia|Akraiphia| , on  |Lake_Copais|Lake_Copais| , provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was skaren  whereas  |Atlantic_bluefin_tuna|Atlantic_Bluefin_Tuna|  was three times as expensive. Dalby, p.67. Common salt water fish were  |yellowfin_tuna|Yellowfin_Tuna| ,  |red_mullet|Red_Mullet| ,  |ray|Batoidea| ,  |swordfish|Swordfish|  or  |sturgeon|Sturgeon| , a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its  |eels|Eel| , celebrated by the hero of  The Acharnians . Other fresh water fish were  |pike-fish|Esox| ,  |carp|Carp|  and the less appreciated  |catfish|Catfish| .     Pictorial evidence of  |Roman|Ancient_Rome|  fishing comes from  |mosaics|Mosaic| .  . At a certain time the  |goatfish|Goatfish|  was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place in garo, in the  |sauce|Garum| . At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why mullus in the feast of  |Trimalchio|Trimalchio|   could be shown as a characteristic of the  parvenu , who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish.     In  |medieval|Medieval|  times, seafood was less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations.  |Kippers|Kipper|  made from herring caught in the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  could be found in markets as far away as  |Constantinople|Constantinople| . Adamson , p. 11. While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked.  |Stockfish|Stockfish| , cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of  |mollusks|Mollusca|  including  |oysters|Oyster| ,  |mussels|Mussel|  and  |scallops|Scallop|  were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater  |crayfish|Crayfish|  were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most. Adamson , pp. 45â€“39.     Modern knowledge of the reproductive cycles of aquatic species has led to the development of  |hatcheries|Fish_Hatchery|  and improved techniques of  |fish_farming|Fish_Farming|  and  |aquaculture|Aquaculture| . Better understanding of the  |hazards|Shellfish_Poisoning|  of eating raw and undercooked fish and shellfish has led to improved preservation methods and processing.               The following table is based on the ISSCAAP classification used by the  |FAO|Fao|  for the purposes of collecting and compiling fishery statistics.  The production figures have been extracted from the FAO FishStat database, Total production, both wild and aquaculture, of seafood species groups in thousand tonnes, sourced from the data reported in the  |FAO|Fao|   and include both capture from wild fisheries and aquaculture production.                    Fish is a highly  |perishable|Decomposition|  product: the fishy smell of dead fish is due to the breakdown of  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|  into  |biogenic_amines|Polyamine|  and  |ammonia|Ammonia| . N. Narain and Nunes, M.L. Marine Animal and Plant Products. In: Handbook of Meat, Poultry and Seafood Quality, L.M.L. Nollet and T. Boylston, eds. Blackwell Publishing 2007, p 247.     Live  |food_fish|Food_Fish|  are often transported in tanks at high expense for an  |international_market|Live_Food_Fish_Trade|  that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. This process originally was started by Lindeye. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored.  While some seafood  |restaurants|Restaurant|  keep live fish in  |aquaria|Aquarium|  for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food fish trade in  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| , for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000  |tonnes|Tonne|  in 2000. Worldwide sales that year were estimated at US$400  million, according to the World Resources Institute.       If the  |cool_chain|Cool_Chain|  has not been adhered to correctly, food products generally decay and become harmful before the  |validity_date|Shelf_Life|  printed on the package. As the potential harm for a consumer when eating rotten fish is much larger than for example with dairy products, the  |U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  has introduced regulation in the USA requiring the use of a  |time_temperature_indicator|Time_Temperature_Indicator|  on certain fresh chilled seafood products.      Fresh fish is a highly perishable food product, so it must be eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are  |filleted|Fish_Fillet|  and displayed for sale on a bed of  |crushed_ice|Crushed_Ice|  or  |refrigerated|Refrigeration| . Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated  |train|Refrigerator_Car|  and  |truck|Refrigerator_Truck| |transportation|Transportation|  has made fresh fish more widely available inland.     Long term  |preservation|Food_Preservation|  of fish is accomplished in a variety of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are  |drying|Stockfish|  and  |salting|Salting| .  |Desiccation|Desiccation|  is commonly used to preserve fish such as  |cod|Cod| . Partial drying and salting is popular for the preservation of fish like  |herring|Herring|  and  |mackerel|Mackerel| . Fish such as  |salmon|Salmon| ,  |tuna|Tuna| , and  |herring|Herring|  are cooked and  |canned|Canning| . Most fish are filleted prior to canning, but some small fish  are only  |decapitated|Decapitation|  and gutted prior to canning.       Seafood is consumed all over the world; it provides the worlds prime source of high-quality  |protein|Protein| .  Fish is among the most common  |food_allergens|Food_Allergy| .      |Iceland|Iceland| ,  |Japan|Japan| , and  |Portugal|Portugal|  are the greatest consumers of seafood per capita in the world. Aquamedia     The UK  |Food_Standards_Agency|Food_Standards_Agency|  recommends that at least two portions of seafood should be consumed each week, one of which should be oil-rich. There are over 100 different types of seafood available around the coast of the UK.     Oil-rich fish such as  |mackerel|Mackerel|  or  |herring|Herring|  are rich in long chain  |Omega-3|Omega-3|  oils. These oils are found in every cell of the human body, and are required for human biological functions such as brain functionality.     Whitefish such as haddock and cod are very low in fat and calories which, combined with oily fish rich in  |Omega-3|Omega-3|  such as  |mackerel|Mackerel| ,  |sardines|Sardine| , fresh  |tuna|Tuna| ,  |salmon|Salmon|  and  |trout|Trout| , can help to protect against  |coronary_heart_disease|Coronary_Heart_Disease| , as well as helping to develop strong bones and teeth.      |Shellfish|Shellfish|  are particularly rich in  |zinc|Zinc| , which is essential for healthy skin and muscles as well as fertility.  |Casanova|Casanova|  reputedly ate 50  |oysters|Oyster|  a day. Slovenko R  Journal of Psychiatry and Law, 29 Page 15, Pan Australia. .       Over 33,000  |species|Species|  of fish and many more marine invertebrate species have been described.  |FishBase|Fishbase|  Retrieved 30 December 2017. Bromophenols, which are produced by marine algae, gives marine animals an odor and taste that is absent from freshwater fish and invertebrates. Also, a chemical substance called dimethylsulfoniopropionate that is found in red and green algae is transferred to animals in the marine food chain. When broken down, dimethyl sulfide is produced, and is often released during food preparation when fresh fish and shellfish are heated. In small quantities it creates a specific smell one associates with the ocean, but which in larger quantities gives the impression of rotten seaweed and old fish.  Another molecule known as  |TMAO|Trimethylamine_N-Oxide|  occurs in fishes and give them a distinct smell. It also exists in freshwater species, but becomes more numerous in the cells of an animal the deeper it lives, so that fish from the deeper parts of the ocean has a stronger taste than species who lives in shallow water.  Eggs from seaweed contains sex pheromones called dictyopterenes, which are meant to attract the sperm. These pheromones are also found in edible seaweeds, which contributes to their aroma.  However, only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans.            Fish can form part of a nutritious diet and is a good source of vitamins and minerals;  |oily_fish|Oily_Fish|  is rich in  |omega-3_fatty_acid|Omega-3_Fatty_Acid| , which may benefit heart health.              |Fish|Fish|  and  |shellfish|Shellfish|  have a natural tendency to concentrate  |mercury|Mercury|  in their bodies, often in the form of  |methylmercury|Methylmercury| , a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the  |food_chain|Food_Chain| , such as  |shark|Shark| ,  |swordfish|Swordfish| ,  |king_mackerel|King_Mackerel| ,  |albacore_tuna|Albacore_Tuna| , and  |tilefish|Tilefish|  contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the  |food_chain|Food_Chain|  amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called  |biomagnification|Biomagnification| . The first occurrence of widespread  |mercury_poisoning|Mercury_Poisoning|  in humans occurred this way in  |Minamata|Minamata,_Kumamoto| ,  |Japan|Japan| , now called  |Minamata_disease|Minamata_Disease| .      |Shellfish|Shellfish|  are among the more common  |food_allergens|Food_Allergy| .    A common misconception is a cross-reactivity between seafood and iodinated  |radiocontrast|Radiocontrast|  agents.             A 2013 study by  |Oceana|Oceana|  found that one third of seafood sampled from the United States was incorrectly labelled.  |Snapper|Lutjanidae|  and  |tuna|Tuna|  were particularly susceptible to mislabelling, and seafood substitution was the most common type of fraud.   |Oceana|Oceana| , February 2013. These practices can harm both the consumers wallet and pose health risks. Another type of mislabelling is short-weighting,    where practices such as overglazing or soaking can misleadingly increase the apparent weight of the fish. The detection of water retention agents helps identify the fraud and its origin.            Research into population trends of various species of seafood is pointing to a global collapse of seafood species by 2048. Such a collapse would occur due to pollution and  |overfishing|Overfishing| , threatening oceanic ecosystems, according to some researchers.  boston.com.
