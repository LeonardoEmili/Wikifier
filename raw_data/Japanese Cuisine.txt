           Japanese cuisine  encompasses the regional and traditional foods of  |Japan|Japan| , which have developed through centuries of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan, , lit. Japanese cuisine , is based on rice with  |miso_soup|Miso_Soup|  and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth.  |Seafood|Seafood|  is common, often grilled, but also served raw as  |sashimi|Sashimi|  or in  |sushi|Sushi| . Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as  |tempura|Tempura| . Apart from rice, staples include noodles, such as  |soba|Soba|  and  |udon|Udon| . Japan also has many simmered dishes such as fish products in broth called  |oden|Oden| , or beef in  |sukiyaki|Sukiyaki|  and  |nikujaga|Nikujaga| .     Historically influenced by  |Chinese_cuisine|Chinese_Cuisine| , Japanese cuisine has opened up to influence from Western cuisines in the modern era. Dishes inspired by foreign food—in particular  |Chinese_food|Chinese_Cuisine| —like  |ramen|Ramen|  and  |gyōza|Gyōza| , as well as foods like  |spaghetti|Spaghetti| , curry, and hamburgers have become adopted with variants for Japanese tastes and ingredients. Traditionally, the Japanese shunned meat due to  |Buddhism|Buddhism| , but with the modernization of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as  |tonkatsu|Tonkatsu|  and  |yakiniku|Yakiniku|  have become common. Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi, has become popular throughout the world.     In 2011, Japan overtook France to become the country with the most 3-starred  |Michelin|List_Of_Michelin_3-Star_Restaurants|  restaurants; as of 2018, the capital Tokyo has maintained the title of the city with the most 3-starred restaurants in the world.              Japanese cuisine is based on combining the  |staple_food|Staple_Food| , which is steamed  |white_rice|Japanese_Rice|  or , with one or several  okazu  or main dishes and side dishes. This may be accompanied by a clear or  |miso_soup|Miso_Soup|  and  tsukemono  .The phrase  refers to the makeup of a typical meal served, but has roots in classic  kaiseki ,  honzen , and yūsoku cuisine. The term is also used to describe the first course served in standard kaiseki cuisine nowadays. , p. 158, explains that in the tea kaiseki, the     Rice is served in its own small bowl , and each main course item is placed on its own small plate  or bowl  for each individual portion. This is done even in Japanese homes. It contrasts with the Western-style dinners at home, where each individual takes helpings from the large serving dishes of food presented at the middle of the dining table. Japanese style traditionally abhors different flavored dishes touching each other on a single plate, so different dishes are given their own individual plates as mentioned, or are partitioned using leaves, etc. Placing main dishes on top of rice and soiling it is also frowned upon by old-fashioned etiquette. , p. 185        Though this tradition originated from Classical Chinese dining formalities, especially after the adoption of Buddhism with its tea ceremony, it became most popular and common during and after the  Kamakura period , such as the  Kaiseki . Japanese cuisine keeps such tradition still, whereas in modern times such practice is in sharp contrast to present day Chinese cuisine, where placing food on rice is standard. However, an exception is the popular  donburi .     The small rice bowl or  chawan  doubles as a word for the large tea bowls in tea ceremonies. Thus in common speech, the drinking cup is referred to as yunomi-jawan or  yunomi  for the purpose of distinction. In the olden days, among the nobility, each course of a full-course Japanese meal would be brought on serving napkins called , which were originally platformed trays or small dining tables. In the modern age,  |faldstool|Faldstool|  trays or stackup-type legged trays may still be seen used in zashiki, i.e.  |tatami|Tatami| -mat rooms, for large banquets or at a  |ryokan|Ryokan|  type inn. Some restaurants might use the suffix  as a more sophisticated though  |dated|Retro_Style|  synonym to the more familiar , since the latter basically is a term for a  |combo_meal|Combination_Meal|  served at a taishū-shokudō, akin to a  |diner|Diner| .  Teishoku means a meal of fixed menu , a dinner à prix fixe Kenkyushas New Japanese-English Dictionary,  served at  or , which is somewhat vague ; but e.g. writer on Japanese popular culture Ishikawa Hiroyoshi  defines it as fare served at , etc., a diner-like establishment.          About 2000 years ago, Japanese cuisine was developed with the influence of China. Rice is a staple in Japanese cuisine. Between 300 and 100 BC, rice was widely used in Japan due to Chinese influence. Wheat and soybeans were introduced shortly after rice. All three act as staple foods in Japanese cuisine today. During the  |Kofun_period|Kofun_Period| , Buddhism became the official religion of the country. Therefore, eating meat and fish were prohibited. In 675 AD,  |Emperor_Tenmu|Emperor_Tenmu|  prohibited the eating of horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens. Rath, E. C. . Reevaluating Rikyū: Kaisekiand the Origins of Japanese Cuisine.

Due to the lack of meat products Japanese people minimized spice utilization. Spices were rare to find back in the day. Spices like pepper and garlic were only used in a minimalist amount. In the absence of meat, fish was served as the main protein, as Japan is an island nation. Fish has influenced many iconic Japanese dishes today. In the 9th century, grilled fish and sliced raw fish were widely popular. Ashkenazi, M. . The Essence of Japanese Cuisine. The History and Culture of Japanese Food.  Japanese people would eat fish in every one of their meals. In traditional Japanese cuisine, oil and fat are usually avoided within the cooking process, because Japanese people were trying to keep a healthy lifestyle.     Preserving fish became a sensation;  |sushi|Sushi|  was originated as means of preserving fish by fermenting it in boiled rice. Fish that are salted and then placed in rice are preserved by  |lactic_acid_fermentation|Lactic_Acid_Fermentation| , which helps prevent proliferation of the bacteria that bring about putrefaction. Jung, S. .  During the 15th century, advancement and development helped shorten the fermentation of sushi to about one to two weeks. Sushi thus became a popular snack food and main entrée, combining fish with rice. During the  |Edo_period|Edo_Period|  , sushi without fermentation was introduced. Sushi was still being consumed without fermentation till the end of 18th century, when the hand-rolled and nigri-type sushi was invented.     In 1854, Japan started to gain new trade deals with Western countries when a new Japanese ruling order took over the old emperor.  |Emperor_Meiji|Emperor_Meiji| , the new ruler, staged a New Years feast designed to embrace the Western world and countries in 1872. The feast contained food that had a lot of European emphasis. For the first time in a thousand years, people were allowed to consume meat in public.

Eating wild game—as opposed to domesticated livestock—was tolerated; in particular, trapped  |hare|Japanese_Hare|  was counted using the  |measure_word|Measure_Word|  , a term normally reserved for birds.     Vegetable consumption has dwindled while processed foods have become more prominent in Japanese households due to the rising costs of general foodstuffs.
