               Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Often anglicized as Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky, also standardized by the  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress| . His names are also transliterated as Piotr or Petr; Ilitsch or Ilich; and Tschaikowski, Tschaikowsky, Chajkovskij, or Chaikovsky. He used to sign his name/was known as P. Tschaïkowsky/Pierre Tschaïkowsky in  |French|French_Language|  , and Peter Tschaikowsky in  |German|German_Language| , spellings also displayed on several of his scores title pages in their first printed editions alongside or in place of his native name.  was a  |Russian|Russians|  composer of the  |romantic|Romantic_Music|  period, whose works are among the most popular music in the  |classical|Classical_Music|  repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by  |Emperor_Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Russia| , and awarded a lifetime pension.     Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a  |civil_servant|Civil_Servant| . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent  |Saint_Petersburg_Conservatory|Saint_Petersburg_Conservatory| , from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary  |nationalist|Nationalism|  movement embodied by the Russian composers of  |The_Five|The_Five| , with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovskys training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovskys self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of  |Peter_the_Great|Peter_The_Great| . This resulted in uncertainty among the  |intelligentsia|Intelligentsia|  about the countrys national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovskys career.     Despite his many popular successes, Tchaikovskys life was punctuated by personal crises and  |depression|Depression| . Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for  |boarding_school|Boarding_School|  followed by his mothers early death, the death of his close friend and colleague  |Nikolai_Rubinstein|Nikolai_Rubinstein| , and the collapse of the one enduring relationship of his adult life, which was his 13-year association with the wealthy widow  |Nadezhda_von_Meck|Nadezhda_Von_Meck|  who was his  |patron|Patron|  even though they never actually met each other. His  |homosexuality|Homosexuality| , which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some musicologists now downplay its importance. Tchaikovskys sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to  |cholera|Cholera| ; there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the  |cause_of_death|Death_Of_Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky| , and whether his death was accidental or  |self-inflicted|Suicide| .     While his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base  |exoticism|Exoticism|  and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovskys music as lacking in elevated thought , according to longtime  New York Times  music critic  |Harold_C._Schonberg|Harold_C._Schonberg| , and derided its formal workings as deficient because they did not stringently follow Western principles.                Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born in  |Votkinsk|Votkinsk| , a small town in  |Vyatka_Governorate|Vyatka_Governorate|   in the  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire| , into a family with a long line of military service. His father, Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky, had served as a lieutenant colonel and engineer in the Department of Mines, Holden, 4. and would manage the  |Kamsko-Votkinsk|Votkinsk|  Ironworks. His grandfather, Pyotr Fedorovich Tchaikovsky , was born in the village of Mikolayivka, Poltava Gubernia, Russian Empire ,  and served first as a physicians assistant in the army and later as city governor of  |Glazov|Glazov|  in Vyatka. His great-grandfather, a Ukrainian     |Cossack|Cossacks|  named Fyodor Chaika, distinguished himself under  |Peter_the_Great|Peter_The_Great|  at the  |Battle_of_Poltava|Battle_Of_Poltava|  in 1709. Brown, Early, 19  Tchaikovskys mother, Alexandra Andreyevna , was the second of Ilyas three wives, 18 years her husbands junior and  |French|French_People|  and  |German|German_People|  on her fathers side. Poznansky, Eyes, 1; Holden, 5. Both Ilya and Alexandra were trained in the arts, including music—a necessity as a posting to a remote area of Russia also meant a need for entertainment, whether in private or at social gatherings. Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 6. Of his six siblings, Tchaikovsky had four brothers , a sister and a half-sister from his fathers first marriage . Anatoly would later have a prominent legal career, while Modest became a dramatist,  |librettist|Librettist| , and translator . Tchaikovsky was close to his sister Alexandra and twin brothers Anatoly and  |Modest|Modest_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky| . Alexandras marriage to Lev Davydov Holden, 31. would produce seven children  and lend Tchaikovsky the only real family life he would know as an adult, especially during his years of wandering. Holden, 43. One of those children,  |Vladimir_Davydov|Vladimir_Davydov| , whom the composer would nickname Bob, would become very close to him. Holden, 202.     In 1844, the family hired Fanny Dürbach, a 22-year-old French governess. Brown, Early, 22; Holden, 7. Four-and-a-half-year-old Tchaikovsky was initially thought too young to study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family. His insistence convinced Dürbach otherwise. Holden, 7. By the age of six, he had become fluent in French and German. Tchaikovsky also became attached to the young woman; her affection for him was reportedly a counter to his mothers coldness and emotional distance from him, Brown, Early, 27; Holden, 6–8 though others assert that the mother doted on her son. Poznansky, Quest, 5. Dürbach saved much of Tchaikovskys work from this period, including his earliest known compositions, and became a source of several childhood anecdotes. Brown, Early, 25–26; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 7.     Tchaikovsky began piano lessons at age five. Precocious, within three years he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher. His parents, initially supportive, hired a tutor, bought an  |orchestrion|Orchestrion|  , and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons. However, they decided in 1850 to send Tchaikovsky to the  |Imperial_School_of_Jurisprudence|Imperial_School_Of_Jurisprudence|  in Saint Petersburg. They had both graduated from institutes in Saint Petersburg and the School of Jurisprudence, which mainly served the lesser nobility, and thought that this education would prepare Tchaikovsky for a career as a civil servant. Brown, Early, 31; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 8. Regardless of talent, the only musical careers available in Russia at that time—except for the affluent aristocracy—were as a teacher in an academy or as an instrumentalist in one of the Imperial Theaters. Both were considered on the lowest rank of the social ladder, with individuals in them enjoying no more rights than peasants. Maes, 33. His fathers income was also growing increasingly uncertain, so both parents may have wanted Tchaikovsky to become independent as soon as possible. Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 8. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12 and Tchaikovsky was only 10 at the time, he was required to spend two years boarding at the Imperial School of Jurisprudences preparatory school,  from his family. Holden, 14; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 26. Once those two years had passed, Tchaikovsky transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies. Holden, 20.          Tchaikovskys early separation from his mother caused an emotional trauma that lasted the rest of his life and was intensified by her death from  |cholera|Cholera|  in 1854, when he was fourteen. Holden, 15; Poznansky, Quest, 11–12. Her death affected him so much that he could not inform Fanny Dürbach until two years later . More than 25 years after his loss, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, Every moment of that appalling day is as vivid to me as though it were yesterday The loss of his mother also prompted Tchaikovsky to make his first serious attempt at composition, a  |waltz|Waltz|  in her memory. Tchaikovskys father, who had also contracted cholera but recovered fully, sent him back to school immediately in the hope that classwork would occupy the boys mind. Holden, 23. Isolated, Tchaikovsky compensated with friendships with fellow students that became lifelong; these included  |Aleksey_Apukhtin|Aleksey_Apukhtin|  and Vladimir Gerard. Holden, 23–24, 26; Poznansky, Quest, 32–37; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 30. Music, while not an official priority at school, also bridged the gap between Tchaikovsky and his peers. They regularly attended the opera Holden, 24; Poznansky, Quest, 26 and Tchaikovsky would improvise at the schools  |harmonium|Pump_Organ|  on themes he and his friends had sung during choir practice. We were amused, Vladimir Gerard later remembered, but not imbued with any expectations of his future glory . As quoted in Holden, 25. Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies through Franz Becker, an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school; however, the results, according to musicologist  |David_Brown|David_Brown| , were negligible . Brown, Early, 43.     In 1855, Tchaikovskys father funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger and questioned him about a musical career for his son. While impressed with the boys talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. Holden, 24–25; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 31. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Poznansky, Eyes, 17. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice. Holden, 25; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 31.            On 10 June 1859, the 19-year-old Tchaikovsky graduated as a titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. Appointed to the Ministry of Justice, he became a junior assistant within six months and a senior assistant two months after that. He remained a senior assistant for the rest of his three-year civil service career. Brown, Man and Music, 14.     Meanwhile, the  |Russian_Musical_Society|Russian_Musical_Society|  was founded in 1859 by the  |Grand_Duchess_Elena_Pavlovna|Princess_Charlotte_Of_Württemberg|   and her protégé, pianist and composer  |Anton_Rubinstein|Anton_Rubinstein| . Previous tsars and the aristocracy had focused almost exclusively on importing European talent. Maes, 31. The aim of the RMS was to fulfill Alexander IIs wish to foster native talent. Maes, 35. It hosted a regular season of public concerts  Volkov, 71. and provided basic professional training in music. Maes, 35; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 36. In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended RMS classes in  |music_theory|Music_Theory|  taught by  |Nikolai_Zaremba|Nikolai_Zaremba|  at the  |Mikhailovsky_Palace|Mikhailovsky_Palace|  . Brown, Early, 60 These classes were a precursor to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, which opened in 1862. Tchaikovsky enrolled at the Conservatory as part of its premiere class. He studied  |harmony|Harmony|  and  |counterpoint|Counterpoint|  with Zaremba and instrumentation and composition with Rubinstein. Brown, Man and Music, 20; Holden, 38–39; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 36–38.     The Conservatory benefited Tchaikovsky in two ways. It transformed him into a musical professional, with tools to help him thrive as a composer, and the in-depth exposure to European principles and musical forms gave him a sense that his art was not exclusively Russian or Western. Taruskin, Grove Opera, 4:663–64. This mindset became important in Tchaikovskys reconciliation of Russian and European influences in his compositional style. He believed and attempted to show that both these aspects were intertwined and mutually dependent . Figes, xxxii; Volkov, 111–12. His efforts became both an inspiration and a starting point for other Russian composers to build their own individual styles. Hosking, 347.        Rubinstein was impressed by Tchaikovskys musical talent on the whole and cited him as a composer of genius in his autobiography. Poznansky, Eyes, 47–48; Rubinstein, 110. He was less pleased with the more progressive tendencies of some of Tchaikovskys student work. Brown, Early, 76; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 35. Nor did he change his opinion as Tchaikovskys reputation grew. Tchaikovsky ascribed Rubinsteins coolness to a difference in musical temperaments. Rubinstein could have been jealous professionally of Tchaikovskys greater impact as a composer.  |Homophobia|Homophobia|  might have been another factor . An exception to Rubinsteins antipathy was the  Serenade for Strings , which he declared Tchaikovskys best piece when he heard it in rehearsal. At last this St. Petersburg pundit, who had growled with such consistent disapproval at Tchaikovskys successive compositions, had found a work by his former pupil which he could endorse, according to Tchaikovsky biographer  |David_Brown|David_Brown|  . He and Zaremba clashed with Tchaikovsky when he submitted his  |First_Symphony|Symphony_No._1|  for performance by the RMS in Saint Petersburg. Rubinstein and Zaremba refused to consider the work unless substantial changes were made. Tchaikovsky complied but they still refused to perform the symphony. Brown, Early, 100–01. Tchaikovsky, distressed that he had been treated as though he were still their student, withdrew the symphony. It was given its first complete performance, minus the changes Rubinstein and Zaremba had requested, in Moscow in February 1868. Brown, New Grove, 18:608.     Once Tchaikovsky graduated in 1865, Rubinsteins brother  |Nikolai|Nikolai_Rubinstein|  offered him the post of Professor of Music Theory at the soon-to-open  |Moscow_Conservatory|Moscow_Conservatory| . While the salary for his professorship was only 50  |rubles|Russian_Ruble|  a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovskys morale and he accepted the post eagerly. He was further heartened by news of the first public performance of one of his works, his Characteristic Dances, conducted by  |Johann_Strauss_II|Johann_Strauss_Ii|  at a concert in  |Pavlovsk_Park|Pavlovsk_Park|  on 11 September 1865 . Brown, Early, 82–83.     From 1867 to 1878, Tchaikovsky combined his professorial duties with  |music_criticism|Music_Journalism|  while continuing to compose. Holden, 83; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 61. This activity exposed him to a range of contemporary music and afforded him the opportunity to travel abroad. Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 87. In his reviews, he praised  |Beethoven|Ludwig_Van_Beethoven| , considered  |Brahms|Johannes_Brahms|  overrated and, despite his admiration, took  |Schumann|Robert_Schumann|  to task for poor orchestration. Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 79. His critique led Tchaikovsky to consider rescoring Schumanns symphonies, a project he never realized . He appreciated the staging of  |Wagners|Richard_Wagner|   Der Ring des Nibelungen  at its inaugural performance in  |Bayreuth|Bayreuth| ,  |Germany|Germany| , but not the music, calling  Das Rheingold  unlikely nonsense, through which, from time to time, sparkle unusually beautiful and astonishing details . As quoted in Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 95. A recurring theme he addressed was the poor state of Russian opera. Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 77.               In 1856, while Tchaikovsky was still at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the RMS, critic  |Vladimir_Stasov|Vladimir_Stasov|  and an 18-year-old pianist,  |Mily_Balakirev|Mily_Balakirev| , met and agreed upon a  |nationalist|Musical_Nationalism|  agenda for Russian music, one that would take the operas of  |Mikhail_Glinka|Mikhail_Glinka|  as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use non-Western harmonic devices such as the  |whole_tone|Whole_Tone_Scale|  and  |octatonic_scales|Octatonic_Scale| . Figes, 178–81. They saw Western-style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent. Maes, 8–9; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 27. Eventually, Balakirev,  |César_Cui|César_Cui| ,  |Modest_Mussorgsky|Modest_Mussorgsky| ,  |Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov|Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov|  and  |Alexander_Borodin|Alexander_Borodin|  became known as the moguchaya kuchka, translated into English as the Mighty Handful or  |The_Five|The_Five| . Garden, New Grove , 8:913. Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training. Maes, 39. Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle. Maes, 42.     While ambivalent about much of The Fives music, Tchaikovsky remained on friendly terms with most of its members. Maes, 49. In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovskys first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture  Romeo and Juliet , a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. Brown, Man and Music, 49. The group also welcomed his  |Second_Symphony|Symphony_No._2| , subtitled the Little Russian. Brown, Early, 255. Despite their support, Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group as well as from the conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Holden, 51–52.          The infrequency of Tchaikovskys musical successes, won with tremendous effort, exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism. Nikolai Rubinsteins private fits of rage critiquing his music, most famously attacking the  |First_Piano_Concerto|Piano_Concerto_No._1| , did not help matters. His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions.  |Hans_von_Bülow|Hans_Von_Bülow|  premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor. Steinberg, Concerto, 474–76; Wiley, New Grove , 25:161. Other artists included  |Adele_Aus_der_Ohe|Adele_Aus_Der_Ohe| ,  |Max_Erdmannsdörfer|Max_Erdmannsdörfer| ,  |Eduard_Nápravník|Eduard_Nápravník|  and  |Sergei_Taneyev|Sergei_Taneyev| .          Another factor that helped Tchaikovskys music become popular was a shift in attitude among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovskys works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composers popularity. Wiley, New Grove , 25:153–54.     During the late 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas. His first,  The Voyevoda , based on a play by  |Alexander_Ostrovsky|Alexander_Ostrovsky| , premiered in 1869. The composer became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript.  Undina  followed in 1870. Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed. Taruskin, 665. Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called Mandragora, to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects. Holden, 75–76; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 58–59.     The first Tchaikovsky opera to survive intact,  The Oprichnik , premiered in 1874. During its composition, he lost Ostrovskys part-finished libretto. Tchaikovsky, too embarrassed to ask for another copy, decided to write the libretto himself, modelling his dramatic technique on that of  |Eugène_Scribe|Eugène_Scribe| . Cui wrote a characteristically savage press attack on the opera. Mussorgsky, writing to  |Vladimir_Stasov|Vladimir_Stasov| , disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public. Nevertheless, The Oprichnik continues to be performed from time to time in Russia.     The last of the early operas,  Vakula the Smith  , was composed in the second half of 1874. The libretto, based on  |Gogols|Nikolai_Gogol|   Christmas Eve , was to have been set to music by  |Alexander_Serov|Alexander_Serov| . With Serovs death, the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the  |Imperial_Mariinsky_Theatre|Imperial_Mariinsky_Theatre| . Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere, the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception. Brown, Viking, 1086. After Tchaikovskys death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the opera  Christmas Eve , based on the same story. Maes, 171.     Other works of this period include the  Variations on a Rococo Theme  for  |cello|Cello|  and orchestra, the  |Third|Symphony_No._3|  and  |Fourth_Symphonies|Symphony_No._4| , the ballet  Swan Lake , and the opera  Eugene Onegin .               Discussion of Tchaikovskys personal life, especially his sexuality, has perhaps been the most extensive of any composer in the 19th century and certainly of any Russian composer of his time. Wiley, Tchaikovsky, xvi. It has also at times caused considerable confusion, from  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  efforts to expunge all references to same-sex attraction and portray him as a heterosexual, to efforts at armchair analysis by Western biographers. Maes, 133–34; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, xvii. Biographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was homosexual. Poznansky, Quest, all. He sought the company of other men in his circle for extended periods, associating openly and establishing professional connections with them . Wiley, New Grove , 25:147. His first love was reportedly Sergey Kireyev, a younger fellow student at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence. According to Modest Tchaikovsky, this was Pyotr Ilyichs strongest, longest and purest love . The degree to which the composer might have felt comfortable with his sexual nature has, however, remained open to debate. It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky, according to musicologist and biographer  |David_Brown|David_Brown| , felt tainted within himself, defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape Brown, Early, 50. or whether, according to Alexander Poznansky, he experienced no unbearable guilt over his sexual nature and eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality  ... without experiencing any serious psychological damage . Poznansky, as quoted in Holden, 394. Relevant portions of his brother Modests autobiography, where he tells of the composers sexual orientation, have been published, as have letters previously suppressed by Soviet censors in which Tchaikovsky openly writes of it. Poznansky, Eyes, 8, 24, 77, 82, 103–05, 165–68. Also see P.I. Chaikovskii. Almanakh, vypusk 1, . Such censorship has persisted in the current Russian government, resulting in many officials, including the current culture minister  |Vladimir_Medinsky|Vladimir_Medinsky| , to outright deny his homosexuality.      Tchaikovsky lived as a bachelor for most of his life. In 1868 he met Belgian soprano  |Désirée_Artôt|Désirée_Artôt| . They became infatuated with each other and were engaged to be married Brown, Early Years, 156–57; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 53. but due to Artôts refusal to give up the stage or settle in Russia, the relationship ended. Brown, Early, 156–58; Poznansky, Eyes, 88. Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved.  In 1877, at the age of 37, he wed a former student,  |Antonina_Miliukova|Antonina_Miliukova| . Brown, Crisis, 137–47; Polayansky, Quest, 207–08, 219–20; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 147–50. The marriage was a disaster. Mismatched psychologically and sexually, Brown, Crisis, 146–48; Poznansky, Quest, 234; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 152. the couple lived together for only two and a half months before Tchaikovsky left, overwrought emotionally and suffering from an acute  |writers_block|Writers_Block| . Brown, Crisis, 157; Poznansky, Quest, 234; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 155. Tchaikovskys family remained supportive of him during this crisis and throughout his life. Wiley, New Grove , 25:147. He was also aided by Nadezhda von Meck , the widow of a railway magnate, who had begun contact with him not long before the marriage. As well as an important friend and emotional support, Holden, 159, 231–32. she became his patroness for the next 13 years, which allowed him to focus exclusively on composition. Brown, Man and Music, 171–72. Tchaikovskys marital debacle may have forced him to face the full truth about his sexuality; he never blamed Antonina for the failure of their marriage. Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 120.       thu , Tchaikovskys patroness and confidante from 1877 to 1890   Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto . Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 159, 170, 193. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. Brown, Crisis, 297. Rubinstein had actually been operating under the assumption that Tchaikovsky might leave from the onset of the composers marital crisis and was prepared for it . However, his meddling in the Tchaikovsky–von Meck relationship might have contributed to the composers actual departure. Rubinsteins actions, which soured his relations with both Tchaikovsky and von Meck, included imploring von Meck in person to end Tchaikovskys subsidy for the composers own good . Rubinsteins actions, in turn, had been spurred by Tchaikovskys withdrawal from the Russian delegation for the 1878 Paris Worlds Fair , a position for which Rubinstein had lobbied on the composers behalf . Rubinstein had been scheduled to conduct four concerts there; the first featured Tchaikovskys First Piano Concerto . For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. Brown, Man and Music, 219. During this time, Tchaikovskys foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky s call for universal unity with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevskys speech, Tchaikovskys music had been considered overly dependent on the West . As Dostoyevskys message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovskys music evaporated. Volkov, 126. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois , Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev . Volkov, 122–23.     Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, Celebration of this anniversary did not take place as Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881. and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the  |1812_Overture|1812_Overture| , would be very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it . As quoted in Brown, Wandering, 119. He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that I shant be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts . Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best ., Brown, Man and Music, 224. particularly well-known for the use of cannon in the scores. Aaron Green, THOUGHTCo.,25 March 2017     On 23 March 1881, Nikolai Rubinstein died in Paris . That December, Tchaikovsky started work on his Piano Trio in A  minor , dedicated to the memory of a great artist . As quoted in Brown, Wandering, 151. First performed privately at the Moscow Conservatory on the first anniversary of Rubinsteins death, the piece became extremely popular during the composers lifetime; in November 1893, it would become Tchaikovskys own elegy at memorial concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Brown, Wandering, 151–52. The piece also fulfilled a long-standing request by von Meck for such a work, to be performed by her then-house pianist, Claude Debussy .       thu Alexander III     In 1884, Tchaikovsky began to shed his unsociability and restlessness. That March, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir , which included a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar. This was seen as a seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovskys social standing Brown, New Grove, 18:621; Holden, 233. and might have been cemented in the composers mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg. Brown, Man and Music, 275. In 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of  |Eugene_Onegin|Eugene_Onegin|  at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. Its only other production had been by students from the Conservatory. By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre , he served notice that Tchaikovskys music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, by virtue of Ivan Vsevolozhsky , Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the Tsar. This made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in actual title. Maes, 140; Taruskin, Grove Opera, 4:664.     thu , now the Tchaikovsky Museum     Despite Tchaikovskys disdain for public life, he now participated in it as part of his increasing celebrity and out of a duty he felt to promote Russian music. He helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev , who was now director of Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–1890 season. In this post, he invited many international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms , Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet . Wiley, New Grove , 25:162.     During this period, Tchaikovsky also began promoting Russian music as a conductor, In January 1887, he substituted, on short notice, at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow for performances of his opera  |Cherevichki|Cherevichki| . Holden, 261; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 197. Within a year, he was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia. These appearances helped him overcome life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance. Holden, 266; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 232. In 1888, Tchaikovsky led the premiere of his Fifth Symphony in Saint Petersburg, repeating the work a week later with the first performance of his tone poem  |Hamlet|Hamlet| . Although critics proved hostile, with César Cui calling the symphony routine and meretricious , both works were received with extreme enthusiasm by audiences and Tchaikovsky, undeterred, continued to conduct the symphony in Russia and Europe. Holden, 272–73. Conducting brought him to the United States in 1891, where he led the New York Music Societys orchestra in his Festival Coronation March at the inaugural concert of Carnegie Hall . Brown, Final, 319–20         thu , where he conducted five concerts in January 1893   In November 1887, Tchaikovsky arrived at Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts , devoted exclusively to the music of Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov , with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch. Brown, Final Years, 90–91 Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov , Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle , named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Maes, 173 Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the Five and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. Brown, Final, 92. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovskys death. Poznansky, Quest, 564. Rimsky-Korsakov, 308.     In 1892, Tchaikovsky was voted a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in France, only the second Russian subject to be so honored . Poznansky, Quest, 548–49. The following year, the University of Cambridge in England awarded Tchaikovsky an honorary Doctor of Music degree. Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 264.         On 16/28 October 1893, Tchaikovsky conducted the premiere of his Sixth Symphony , the Pathétique in Saint Petersburg. Nine days later, Tchaikovsky died there, aged 53. He was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery , near the graves of fellow-composers Alexander Borodin , Mikhail Glinka , and Modest Mussorgsky ; later, Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev were also buried nearby. Brown, Final, 487.     While Tchaikovskys death has traditionally been attributed to cholera from drinking unboiled water at a local restaurant , Brown Man and Music, 430–32; Holden, 371; Warrack, Tchaikovsky, 269–70. as one story accounts, there has been much speculation as to whether or not his death was suicide. Brown, Man and Music, 431–35; Holden, 373–400. Opinion has been summarized as follows: The  |polemics|Polemics|  over death have reached an impasse ... Rumors attached to the famous die hard ... As for illness, problems of evidence offer little hope of satisfactory resolution: the state of diagnosis; the confusion of witnesses; disregard of long-term effects of smoking and alcohol. We do not know how Tchaikovsky died. We may never find out ... . Wiley, New Grove , 25:169.               Tchaikovsky wrote many works that are popular with the classical music public, including his  Romeo and Juliet , the  1812 Overture , his three ballets  and  Marche Slave . These, along with his First Piano Concerto and his  |Violin_Concerto|Violin_Concerto| , the last three of his six numbered  |symphonies|Symphony|  and his operas  The Queen of Spades  and  Eugene Onegin , are among his most familiar works. Almost as popular are the  |Manfred_Symphony|Manfred_Symphony| ,  Francesca da Rimini , the  Capriccio Italien  and the  |Serenade_for_Strings|Serenade_For_Strings| . Schonberg, 367.          Tchaikovsky displayed an unusually wide stylistic and emotional range, from  |salon_works|Salon_Music|  of innocuous charm to symphonies of tremendous depth, power, and grandeur. Some of his works, such as the  Variations on a Rococo Theme , employ a poised Classical form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as  |Mozart|Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|  . Other compositions, such as his  |Little_Russian_symphony|Symphony_No._2|  and his opera  Vakula the Smith , flirt with musical practices more akin to those of the Five, especially in their use of folk song. Brown, New Grove , 18:628. Other works, such as Tchaikovskys last three symphonies, employ a personal musical idiom that facilitated intense emotional expression. Brown, New Grove, 18:606.       Tchaikovsky first visited  |Ukraine|Ukraine|  in 1864, staying in  |Trostianets|Trostianets|  where he wrote his first orchestral work,  The Storm  overture. Over the next 28 years, he visited over 15 places in Ukraine, where he stayed a few months at the time. Among his most favorite places was  |Kamianka|Kamianka,_Cherkasy_Oblast| ,  |Cherkasy_Oblast|Cherkasy_Oblast| , where his sister Alexandra lived with her family. He wrote of Kamianka: I found a feeling of peace in my soul, which I couldnt find in Moscow and St Petersburg .  Tchaikovsky wrote more than 30 compositions while in Ukraine. He also visited Ukrainian composer  |Mykola_Lysenko|Mykola_Lysenko|  and attended his  Taras Bulba  opera performance in 1890 in the  |Kiev_Opera_House|National_Opera_Of_Ukraine| . Tchaikovsky was one of the founders of the  |Kiev_Music_Conservatory|Tchaikovsky_National_Music_Academy_Of_Ukraine| , which was later renamed after him. He also performed in concerts as a conductor in  |Kiev|Kiev| ,  |Odessa|Odessa| , and  |Kharkiv|Kharkiv| .              American  |music_critic|Music_Critic|  and  |journalist|Journalist| |Harold_C._Schonberg|Harold_C._Schonberg|  wrote of Tchaikovskys sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of  |melody|Melody|  , a feature that has ensured his musics continued success with audiences. Schonberg, 366. Tchaikovskys complete range of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions. Sometimes he used Western-style melodies, sometimes original melodies written in the style of Russian folk song; sometimes he used actual folk songs. According to The New Grove, Tchaikovskys melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways. The first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage. Unlike Western themes, the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self-contained; they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development. On a technical level, it made  |modulating|Modulation|  to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult, as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music. Brown, Final, 424. The second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic-age composers. They did not write in the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with  |sonata_form|Sonata_Form| , such as those favored by Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven, but were complete and independent in themselves. Cooper, 26. This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another. This challenge was why the Romantics were never natural symphonists . Cooper, 24. All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them, even when he modified them to generate tension, maintain interest and satisfy listeners. Warrack, Symphonies, 8–9.       Harmony could be a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, according to Brown, since Russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self-enclosed tableaux, while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and, on a larger scale, shape it. Brown, Final, 422, 432–34.  |Modulation|Modulation| , the shifting from one key to another, was a driving principle in both harmony and  |sonata_form|Sonata_Form| , the primary Western large-scale  |musical_structure|Musical_Form|  since the middle of the 18th century. Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time-scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other. Roberts, New Grove , 12:454. One point in Tchaikovskys favor was a flair for harmony that astonished Rudolph Kündinger, Tchaikovskys music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence. As quoted in Polyansky, Eyes, 18. Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies, this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the  |whole_tone_scale|Whole_Tone_Scale|  in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony, a practice more typically used by The Five.        |Rhythmically|Rhythm| , Tchaikovsky sometimes experimented with unusual  |meters|Meter| . More often, he used a firm, regular meter, a practice that served him well in dance music. At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music. They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements—a synthetic propulsion , as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements. This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music. Brown, New Grove , 18:628; Final, 424.        Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form. Its principle of organic growth through the interplay of musical themes was alien to Russian practice. The traditional argument that Tchaikovsky seemed unable to develop themes in this manner fails to consider this point; it also discounts the possibility that Tchaikovsky might have intended the development passages in his large-scale works to act as enforced hiatuses to build tension, rather than grow organically as smoothly progressive musical arguments. Zajaczkowski, 25     According to Brown and musicologists  |Hans_Keller|Hans_Keller|  and  |Daniel_Zhitomirsky|Daniel_Zhitomirsky| , Tchaikovsky found his solution to large-scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony. He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an outline , as Zhitomirsky phrases it. Zhitomirsky, 102. Within this outline, the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another, with what Keller calls new and violent contrasts between  |musical_themes|Theme| ,  |keys|Key| , and harmonies. Brown, Final, 426; Keller, 347. This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum Brown, Final, 426. and adds intense drama. Keller, 346–47. While the result, Warrack charges, is still an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them in the Germanic sense, Warrack, Symphonies, 11. Brown counters that it took the listener of the period through a succession of often highly charged sections which added up to a radically new kind of symphonic experience , one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation.     Partly due to the melodic and structural intricacies involved in this accumulation and partly due to the composers nature, Tchaikovskys music became intensely expressive. Brown, New Grove , 18:628; Keller, 346–47; Maes, 161. This intensity was entirely new to Russian music and prompted some Russians to place Tchaikovskys name alongside that of Dostoyevsky. Volkov, 115 German musicologist  |Hermann_Kretzschmar|Hermann_Kretzschmar|  credits Tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering full images of life, developed freely, sometimes even dramatically, around psychological contrasts ... This music has the mark of the truly lived and felt experience . As quoted in Botstein, 101. Botstein, in elaborating on this comment, suggests that listening to Tchaikovskys music became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience, one that reflected on the dynamic nature of the listener’s own emotional self . This active engagement with the music opened for the listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one’s own truly lived and felt experience or one’s search for intensity in a deeply personal sense . Botstein, 101.            As mentioned above, repetition was a natural part of Tchaikovskys music, just as it is an integral part of Russian music. Warrack, Symphonies, 9. Also see Brown, Final, 422–23. His use of  |sequences|Sequence|  within melodies  Benward and Saker, 111–12. could go on for extreme length. The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it. Brown, Final, 423–24; Warrack, Symphonies, 9. Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements. Maes, 161. By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listeners interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity , as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place. Brown, New Grove , 18:628. Also see Bostrick, 105. Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement. Cooper, 32.          Like other late Romantic composers, Tchaikovsky relied heavily on  |orchestration|Orchestration|  for musical effects. Holoman, New Grove , 12:413. Tchaikovsky, however, became noted for the sensual opulence and voluptuous timbrel virtuosity of his  |orchestration|Orchestration| . Maes, 73; Taruskin, Grove Opera, 4:669. Like Glinka, Tchaikovsky tended toward bright primary  |colors|Timbre|  and sharply delineated contrasts of  |texture|Texture| . Brown, New Grove , 18:628; Hopkins, New Grove , 13:698. However, beginning with the  |Third_Symphony|Symphony_No._3| , Tchaikovsky experimented with an increased range of timbres Maes, 78. Tchaikovskys scoring was noted and admired by some of his peers. Rimsky-Korsakov regularly referred his students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to it and called it devoid of all striving after effect, give a healthy, beautiful sonority . As quoted in Taruskin, Stravinsky, 206. This sonority, musicologist  |Richard_Taruskin|Richard_Taruskin|  points out, is essentially Germanic in effect. Tchaikovskys expert use of having two or more instruments play a melody simultaneously  and his ear for uncanny combinations of instruments resulted in a generalized orchestral sonority in which the individual timbres of the instruments, being thoroughly mixed, would vanish . Taruskin, Stravinsky, 206       In works like the Serenade for Strings and the Variations on a Rococo Theme, Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at writing in a style of 18th-century European  |pastiche|Pastiche| . In the ballet The Sleeping Beauty and the opera The Queen of Spades, Tchaikovsky graduated from imitation to full-scale evocation. This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls passé-ism , lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past seem as though it were the present. Volkov, 124. On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn.  Tchaikovskys attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance. Brown, New Grove , 18:613, 615.            Of Tchaikovskys Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann stands out as an influence in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist  |Roland_John_Wiley|Roland_John_Wiley| . Brown, New Grove , 18:613, 18:620; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 58.  |Boris_Asafyev|Boris_Asafyev|  comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky not just as a formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Asafyev, 13–14.  |Leon_Botstein|Leon_Botstein|  claims the music of  |Franz_Liszt|Franz_Liszt|  and  |Richard_Wagner|Richard_Wagner|  also left their imprints on Tchaikovskys orchestral style. Bostein, 103. As proof of Wagners influence, Botstein cites a letter from Tchaikovsky to Taneyev, in which the composer readily admits the influence of the  Nibelungen  on Francesca da Rimini . This letter is quoted in Brown, Crisis, 108. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by  |Franz_Lachner|Franz_Lachner| ,  |Jules_Massenet|Jules_Massenet| , and  |Joachim_Raff|Joachim_Raff|  after the rediscovery of  |Bachs|Johann_Sebastian_Bach|  works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. Fuller, New Grove , 24:681–62; Maes, 155. His teacher Anton Rubinsteins opera  The Demon  became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. Taruskin, Grove Opera, 4:664. So did  |Léo_Delibes|Léo_Delibes|  ballets  Coppélia  and  Sylvia  for The Sleeping Beauty While it is sometimes thought these two ballets also influenced Tchaikovskys work on Swan Lake, he had already composed that work before learning of them . and  |Georges_Bizets|Georges_Bizet|  opera  Carmen  for The Queen of Spades. Brown, Final, 189; Maes, 131, 138, 152. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Wiley, Tchaikovsky, 293–94. Glinka, whose opera  A Life for the Tsar  made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; Brown, Early, 34, 97. and  |Adolphe_Adam|Adolphe_Adam| , whose ballet  Giselle  was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Brown, Early, 39, 52, Final, 187. Beethovens string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovskys attempts in that medium. Wiley, New Grove , 25:149. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included  |Hector_Berlioz|Hector_Berlioz| ,  |Felix_Mendelssohn|Felix_Mendelssohn| ,  |Giacomo_Meyerbeer|Giacomo_Meyerbeer| ,  |Gioachino_Rossini|Gioachino_Rossini| ,   |Giuseppe_Verdi|Giuseppe_Verdi| ,   |Vincenzo_Bellini|Vincenzo_Bellini|   and  |Henry_Litolff|Henry_Litolff| . Brown, Early, 72.       Maes maintains that, regardless of what he was writing, Tchaikovskys main concern was how his music impacted his listeners on an aesthetic level, at specific moments in the piece and on a cumulative level once the music had finished. What his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself. Maes, 138. Tchaikovskys focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart. Considering that he lived and worked in what was probably the last 19th-century feudal nation, the statement is not actually that surprising. Figes, 274; Maes, 139–41. And yet, even when writing so-called programme music, for example his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form. His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy. Maes, 137. He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned The Sleeping Beauty from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for The Queen of Spades from Modest with their use of 18th century settings stipulated firmly. Maes, 146, 152. Vsevolozhsky originally intended the libretto for a now-unknown composer named Nikolai Klenovsky, not Tchaikovsky . Tchaikovsky also used the  |polonaise|Polonaise|  frequently, the dance being a musical code for the  |Romanov_dynasty|House_Of_Romanov|  and a symbol of Russian patriotism. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners. Figes, 274; Maes, 78–79, 137.                Tchaikovskys relationship with collaborators was mixed. Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, virtuoso and pedagogue  |Leopold_Auer|Leopold_Auer|  rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught it to his students, who included  |Jascha_Heifetz|Jascha_Heifetz|  and  |Nathan_Milstein|Nathan_Milstein| . Steinberg  |Wilhelm_Fitzenhagen|Wilhelm_Fitzenhagen|  intervened considerably in shaping what he considered his piece , the Variations on a Rococo Theme, according to music critic  |Michael_Steinberg|Michael_Steinberg| . Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagens license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellists amendments. Brown, Crisis, 122. The composers original has since been published but most cellists still perform Fitzenhagens version . His collaboration on the three ballets went better and in  |Marius_Petipa|Marius_Petipa| , who worked with him on the last two, he might have found an advocate. Tchaikovskys work with Julius Reisinger on Swan Lake was evidently also successful, since it left him with no qualms about working with Petipa, but very little is written about it . When The Sleeping Beauty was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them to put in the extra effort. Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time. He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score. Maes, 145–48.          Critical reception to Tchaikovskys music was also varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect for not being nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason. Botstein, 99. There might have been a grain of truth in the latter, according to musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the indeterminacy of artistic character ... being truly at home in the non-Russian . As quoted in Botstein, 100. Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music,  |Eduard_Hanslick|Eduard_Hanslick|  lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition whose stink one can hear Hanslick, Eduard, Music Criticisms 1850–1900, ed. and trans. Henry Pleasants . As quoted in Steinberg, Concerto, 487. and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, The furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. Pandemonium,  |delerium_tremens|Delerium_Tremens| , raving, and above all, noise worse confounded! Boston Evening Transcript, 23 October 1892. As quoted in Steinberg, Symphony, 631     The division between Russian and Western critics remained through much of the 20th century but for a different reason. According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovskys music that appealed to audiences—its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration—added up to compositional shallowness. Brown, New Grove , 18:628; Wiley, New Grove , 25:169. The musics use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further. There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovskys music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, spoke to the listener’s imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality . Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the violence and hysteria they detected and felt such emotive displays attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation—the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment—and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement .     There has also been the fact that the composer did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed a professional reevaluation of Tchaikovskys work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, New York Times critic  |Allan_Kozinn|Allan_Kozinn|  writes, It is Tchaikovskys flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded in the context of the whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow .      In the 21st century, however, critics are reacting more positively to Tchaikovskys tunefulness, originality, and craftsmanship. Tchaikovsky is being viewed again as a composer of the first rank, writing music of depth, innovation and influence, according to  |cultural_historian|Cultural_History|  and author  |Joseph_Horowitz|Joseph_Horowitz| . Important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from the disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of the 20th century. Wiley, New Grove , 25:169. We have acquired a different view of Romantic excess, Horowitz says. Tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness; if his music seems harried and insecure, so are we all .           Horowitz maintains that, while the standing of Tchaikovskys music has fluctuated among critics, for the public, it never went out of style, and his most popular works have yielded iconic sound-bytes , such as the love theme from Romeo and Juliet . Along with those tunes, Botstein adds, Tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of Russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music, an art form often associated with emotion . Botstein, 100. Tchaikovskys melodies, stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration, have always ensured audience appeal. Brown, New Grove, 18:606–07, 628. His popularity is considered secure, with his following in many countries, including Great Britain and the United States, second only to that of Beethoven. His music has also been used frequently in popular music and film. Steinberg, The Symphony, 611.       thu , Crimea   According to Wiley, Tchaikovsky was a pioneer in several ways. Thanks in large part to Nadezhda von Meck , Wiley writes, he became the first full-time professional Russian composer . This, Wiley adds, allowed him the time and freedom to consolidate the Western compositional practices he had learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original, deeply personal style. He made an impact in not only absolute works such as the symphony but also program music and, as Wiley phrases it, transformed Liszts and Berliozs achievements ... into matters of Shakespearean elevation and psychological import . Wiley, New Grove , 25:144. Wiley and Holden both note that Tchaikovsky did all this without a native school of composition upon which to fall back. They point out that only Glinka had preceded him in combining Russian and Western practices and his teachers in Saint Petersburg had been thoroughly Germanic in their musical outlook. He was, they write, for all intents and purposes alone in his artistic quest. Holden, xxi; Wiley, New Grove , 25:144.     thu   Maes and Taruskin write that Tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in The Five. Maes, 73; Taruskin, Grove Opera, 4:663. Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality. Maes, 73. Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along at a time when the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was. Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way that was true to himself and what he had learned. Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded. The composers friend, music critic Hermann Laroche , wrote of The Sleeping Beauty that the score contained an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody. This basic element is undoubtedly Russian . As quoted in Maes, 166.     Tchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin. Maes, 73; Taruskin, Grove Opera, 664. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged to not just Russia but also the world at large. Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russias place in European musical culture—the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him to become the first Russian composer to acquaint foreign audiences personally with his own works, Warrack writes, as well as those of other Russian composers. Warrack, 209. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovskys birth, then places the composers achievements into historical perspective: Twenty years after Tchaikovskys death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky s  |The_Rite_of_Spring|The_Rite_Of_Spring|  erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russias arrival into 20th-century music . Between these two very different worlds, Tchaikovskys music became the sole bridge . Holden, xxi.     On 7 May 2010, Google celebrated his 170th birthday with a Google Doodle .
