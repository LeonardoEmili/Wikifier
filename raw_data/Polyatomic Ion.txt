A polyatomic ion, also known as a molecular ion, is a charged  |chemical_species|Chemical_Species|   composed of two or more atoms  |covalently_bonded|Covalent_Bond|  or of a  |metal_complex|Complex|  that can be considered to be acting as a single unit. The prefix poly- means many, in Greek, but even ions of two atoms are commonly referred to as polyatomic. In older literature, a polyatomic ion is also referred to as a  radical , and less commonly, as a radical group. In contemporary usage, the term radical refers to  |free_radicals|Free_Radical|  that are species with an unpaired electron.     An example of a polyatomic ion is the  |hydroxide|Hydroxide|  ion; consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom, hydroxide has a charge of  |−1|Elementary_Charge| . Its chemical formula is . An  |ammonium|Ammonium|  ion consists of one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms: it has a charge of +1, and its chemical formula is .     Polyatomic ions are often useful in the context of  |acid_base_chemistry|Acid–Base_Reaction|  or in the formation of  |salts|Salt| . A polyatomic ion can often be considered as the  |conjugate_acid_or_base|Conjugate_Acid|  of a neutral  |molecule|Molecule| . For example, the conjugate base of  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  is the polyatomic  |hydrogen_sulfate|Hydrogen_Sulfate|  anion . The removal of another  |hydrogen_ion|Hydron|  yields the  |sulfate|Sulfate|  anion .       There are two rules that can be used for learning the nomenclature of polyatomic anions. First, when the prefix bi is added to a name, a hydrogen is added to the ions formula and its charge is increased by 1, the latter being a consequence of the hydrogen ions +1 charge. An alternative to the bi- prefix is to use the word hydrogen in its place: the anion derived from  + , , can be called either bicarbonate or hydrogencarbonate.     Most of the common polyatomic anions are  |oxyanions|Oxyanion| , conjugate bases of  |oxyacids|Oxyacid|  . For example, the  |sulfate|Sulfate|  anion, , is derived from , which can be regarded as  + .     The second rule looks at the number of oxygens in an ion. Consider the  |chlorine|Chlorine| |_oxyanion|Oxyanion|  family:        First, think of the -ate ion as being the base name, in which case the addition of a per- prefix adds an oxygen. Changing the -ate suffix to -ite will reduce the oxygens by one, and keeping the suffix -ite and adding the prefix hypo- reduces the number of oxygens by one more. In all situations, the charge is not affected. The naming pattern follows within many different oxyanion series based on a standard root for that particular series. The -ite has one less oxygen than the -ate, but different -ate anions might have different numbers of oxygen atoms.     These rules do not work with all polyatomic anions, but they do work with the most common ones. Following table give examples for some of these common anion groups.            The following tables give additional examples of commonly encountered polyatomic ions. Only a few representatives are given, as the number of polyatomic ions encountered in practice is very large.
