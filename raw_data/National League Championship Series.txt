The NLCS began in 1969 as a best-of-five playoff and used this format until 1985, when it changed to its current best-of-seven format.       Prior to 1969, the National League champion  was determined by the best win-loss record at the end of the regular season. There were four ad hoc  |three-game_playoff_series|List_Of_Major_League_Baseball_Tie-Breakers|  due to ties under this formulation .      A structured postseason series began in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each league played each other in a best-of-five series to determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed to best-of-seven.     The NLCS and ALCS, since the expansion to seven games, are always played in a 2–3–2 format: games 1, 2, 6, and 7 are played in the stadium of the team that has home field advantage, and games 3, 4, and 5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. Home field advantage is given to the team that has the better record, except that the team that made the postseason as the  |Wild_Card|Wild_Card_Major_League_Baseball|  shall not get home field advantage. From 1969 to 1993, home field advantage was alternated between divisions each year regardless of regular season record and from 1995 to 1997 home field advantage was predetermined before the season.     In 1981, a one-off  |divisional_series|1981_National_League_Division_Series|  was held due to a split season caused by a  |players_strike|1981_Major_League_Baseball_Strike| .     In 1994, the league was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners and a wild-card team advancing to a best-of-five postseason round, the now-permanent  |National_League_Division_Series|National_League_Division_Series|  . The winners of that round advance to the best-of-seven NLCS.     The  |Milwaukee_Brewers|Milwaukee_Brewers| , an American League team between 1969 and 1997, and the  |Houston_Astros|Houston_Astros| , a National League team between 1962 and 2012, are the only franchises to play in both the ALCS and NLCS. The Astros are the only team to have won both an NLCS  and an ALCS . The Astros made four NLCS appearances before moving to the AL in 2013. Every current National League franchise has appeared in the NLCS.       The  |Warren_C._Giles_Trophy|Warren_C._Giles_Trophy| , named for the  |president_of_the_NL|Warren_Giles|  from 1951 to 1969, is awarded to the NLCS winner.        :See: League Championship Series Most Valuable Player AwardNational League winners    A Most Valuable Player  award is given to the outstanding player in the ALCS.
