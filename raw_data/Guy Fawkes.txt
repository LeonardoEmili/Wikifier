                  Guy Fawkes , also known as Guido Fawkes while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial  |English_Catholics|Catholic_Church_In_England_And_Wales|  who planned the failed  |Gunpowder_Plot|Gunpowder_Plot|  of 1605. He was born and educated in  |York|York| ; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a  |recusant|Recusancy|  Catholic.     Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War|  against Protestant Dutch  |reformers|Protestant_Reformation|  in the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries| . He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success. He later met  |Thomas_Wintour|Robert_And_Thomas_Wintour| , with whom he returned to England. Wintour introduced him to  |Robert_Catesby|Robert_Catesby| , who planned to assassinate  and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. The plotters leased an  |undercroft|Undercroft|  beneath the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords| ; Fawkes was placed in charge of the gunpowder which they stockpiled there. The authorities were prompted by an anonymous letter to search  |Westminster_Palace|Westminster_Palace|  during the early hours of 5 November, and they found Fawkes guarding the explosives. He was questioned and tortured over the next few days and confessed to wanting to blow up the House of Lords.     Immediately before his execution on 31 January, Fawkes fell from the scaffold where he was to be hanged and broke his neck, thus avoiding the agony of being  |hanged,_drawn_and_quartered|Hanged,_Drawn_And_Quartered| . He became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been commemorated in the UK as  |Guy_Fawkes_Night|Guy_Fawkes_Night|  since 5 November 1605, when his effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, commonly accompanied by fireworks.              Guy Fawkes was born in 1570 in Stonegate,  |York|York| . He was the second of four children born to Edward Fawkes, a  |proctor|Proctor|  and an advocate of the  |consistory_court|Consistory_Court|  at York, and his wife, Edith. Guys parents were regular communicants of the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , as were his paternal grandparents; his grandmother, born Ellen Harrington, was the daughter of a prominent merchant, who served as  |Lord_Mayor_of_York|Lord_Mayor_Of_York|  in 1536. Fawkes, Guy in  The Dictionary of National Biography ,  |Leslie_Stephen|Leslie_Stephen| , ed., Oxford University Press, London . Guys mothers family were  |recusant_Catholics|Recusancy| , and his cousin, Richard Cowling, became a  |Jesuit|Jesuit|  priest.  Guy was an uncommon name in England, but may have been popular in York on account of a local notable, Sir  |Guy_Fairfax|Guy_Fairfax|  of Steeton.      The date of Fawkess birth is unknown, but he was  |baptised|Baptism|  in the church of  |St_Michael_le_Belfrey,_York|St_Michael_Le_Belfrey,_York|  on 16 April. As the customary gap between birth and baptism was three days, he was probably born about 13 April. In 1568, Edith had given birth to a daughter named Anne, but the child died aged about seven weeks, in November that year. She bore two more children after Guy: Anne , and Elizabeth . Both were married, in 1599 and 1594 respectively.      In 1579, when Guy was eight years old, his father died. His mother remarried several years later, to the Catholic Dionis Baynbrigge of  |Scotton,_Harrogate|Scotton,_Harrogate| . Fawkes may have become a Catholic through the Baynbrigge familys recusant tendencies, and also the Catholic branches of the Pulleyn and Percy families of Scotton, but also from his time at  |St._Peters_School|St_Peters_School,_York|  in York. A governor of the school had spent about 20  years in prison for recusancy, and its headmaster, John Pulleyn, came from a family of noted Yorkshire recusants, the Pulleyns of  |Blubberhouses|Blubberhouses| . In her 1915 work The Pulleynes of Yorkshire, author Catharine Pullein suggested that Fawkess Catholic education came from his Harrington relatives, who were known for harbouring priests, one of whom later accompanied Fawkes to  |Flanders|Flanders|  in 1592–1593. Fawkess fellow students included  |John_Wright|John_And_Christopher_Wright|  and his brother  |Christopher|Christopher_Wright|   and  |Oswald_Tesimond|Oswald_Tesimond| ,  |Edward_Oldcorne|Edward_Oldcorne|  and Robert Middleton, who became priests .     After leaving school Fawkes entered the service of  |Anthony_Browne,_1st_Viscount_Montagu|Anthony_Browne,_1St_Viscount_Montagu| .  The Viscount took a dislike to Fawkes and after a short time dismissed him; he was subsequently employed by  |Anthony-Maria_Browne,_2nd_Viscount_Montagu|Anthony-Maria_Browne,_2Nd_Viscount_Montagu| , who succeeded his grandfather at the age of  18. At least one source claims that Fawkes married and had a son, but no known contemporary accounts confirm this.          In October 1591 Fawkes sold the estate in  |Clifton|Clifton,_York|  in York that he had inherited from his father. He travelled to the continent to fight in the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War|  for Catholic Spain against the new  |Dutch_Republic|Dutch_Republic|  and, from 1595 until the  |Peace_of_Vervins|Peace_Of_Vervins|  in 1598, France. Although England was not by then engaged in land operations against Spain, the two countries were  |still_at_war|Anglo-Spanish_War| , and the  |Spanish_Armada|Spanish_Armada|  of 1588 was only five years in the past. He joined  |Sir_William_Stanley|William_Stanley| , an English Catholic and veteran commander in his mid-fifties who had raised an army in Ireland to fight in  |Leicesters_expedition_to_the_Netherlands|Robert_Dudley,_1St_Earl_Of_Leicester| . Stanley had been held in high regard by  |Elizabeth_I|Elizabeth_I_Of_England| , but following his surrender of  |Deventer|Deventer|  to the Spanish in 1587 he, and most of his troops, had switched sides to serve Spain. Fawkes became an  |alférez|Alférez|  or junior officer, fought well at the  |siege_of_Calais_in_1596|Siege_Of_Calais| , and by 1603 had been recommended for a  |captaincy|Captain| .   That year, he travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England. He used the occasion to adopt the Italian version of his name, Guido, and in his memorandum described  |James_I|James_I_Of_England|  as a heretic , who intended to have all of the Papist sect driven out of England. He denounced Scotland, and the Kings  |favourites|Favourite|  among the Scottish nobles, writing it will not be possible to reconcile these two nations, as they are, for very long . Although he was received politely, the court of  |Philip_III|Philip_Iii_Of_Spain|  was unwilling to offer him any support.                 In 1604 Fawkes became involved with a small group of English Catholics, led by  |Robert_Catesby|Robert_Catesby| , who planned to assassinate the  |Protestant|Protestant| |King_James|James_Vi_And_I|  and replace him with his daughter, third in the line of succession,  |Princess_Elizabeth|Elizabeth_Stuart,_Queen_Of_Bohemia| . Fawkes was described by the Jesuit priest and former school friend  |Oswald_Tesimond|Oswald_Tesimond|  as pleasant of approach and cheerful of manner, opposed to quarrels and strife  ... loyal to his friends . Tesimond also claimed Fawkes was a man highly skilled in matters of war , and that it was this mixture of piety and professionalism that endeared him to his fellow conspirators. The author  |Antonia_Fraser|Antonia_Fraser|  describes Fawkes as a tall, powerfully built man, with thick reddish-brown hair, a flowing moustache in the tradition of the time, and a bushy reddish-brown beard , and that he was a man of action  ... capable of intelligent argument as well as physical endurance, somewhat to the surprise of his enemies.     The first meeting of the five central conspirators took place on Sunday 20 May 1604, at an inn called the Duck and Drake, in the fashionable  |Strand|Strand,_London|  district of London. Catesby had already proposed at an earlier meeting with  |Thomas_Wintour|Robert_And_Thomas_Wintour|  and John Wright to kill the King and his government by blowing up the Parliament House with gunpowder . Wintour, who at first objected to the plan, was convinced by Catesby to travel to the continent to seek help. Wintour met with the Constable of Castile, the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would receive no support from Spain. Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Fawkes, who had by then been away from England for many years, and thus was largely unknown in the country. Wintour and Fawkes were contemporaries; each was militant, and had first-hand experience of the unwillingness of the Spaniards to help. Wintour told Fawkes of their plan to doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott , and thus in April 1604 the two men returned to England. Wintours news did not surprise Catesby; despite positive noises from the Spanish authorities, he feared that the deeds would nott answere .     One of the conspirators,  |Thomas_Percy|Thomas_Percy| , was promoted in June 1604, gaining access to a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the Kings Wardrobe. Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. The contemporaneous account of the prosecution   claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniards house to Parliament, although this story may have been a government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel. If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenants widow was clearing out a nearby  |undercroft|Undercroft| , directly beneath the House of Lords.      The plotters purchased the lease to the room, which also belonged to John Whynniard. Unused and filthy, it was considered an ideal hiding place for the gunpowder the plotters planned to store. According to Fawkes, 20  barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16  more on 20 July.  On 28 July however, the ever-present threat of the plague delayed the opening of Parliament until Tuesday, 5 November.       In an attempt to gain foreign support, in May 1605 Fawkes travelled overseas and informed Hugh Owen of the plotters plan. At some point during this trip his name made its way into the files of  |Robert_Cecil,_1st_Earl_of_Salisbury|Robert_Cecil,_1St_Earl_Of_Salisbury| , who employed a network of spies across Europe. One of these spies, Captain William Turner, may have been responsible. Although the information he provided to Salisbury usually amounted to no more than a vague pattern of invasion reports, and included nothing which regarded the Gunpowder Plot, on 21 April he told how Fawkes was to be brought by Tesimond to England. Fawkes was a well-known Flemish mercenary, and would be introduced to Mr Catesby and honourable friends of the nobility and others who would have arms and horses in readiness . Turners report did not, however, mention Fawkess pseudonym in England, John Johnson, and did not reach Cecil until late in November, well after the plot had been discovered.      It is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed. More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it. Fawkess final role in the plot was settled during a series of meetings in October. He was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames. Simultaneously, a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth. Acts of  |regicide|Regicide|  were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to  |the_continent|Continental_Europe| , where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.           A few of the conspirators were concerned about fellow Catholics who would be present at Parliament during the opening. On the evening of 26 October,  |Lord_Monteagle|William_Parker,_4Th_Baron_Monteagle|  received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away, and to retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for  ... they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament . Despite quickly becoming aware of the letterinformed by one of Monteagles servantsthe conspirators resolved to continue with their plans, as it appeared that it was clearly thought to be a hoax . Fawkes checked the undercroft on 30 October, and reported that nothing had been disturbed. Monteagles suspicions had been aroused, however, and the letter was shown to King James. The King ordered  |Sir_Thomas_Knyvet|Thomas_Knyvet,_1St_Baron_Knyvet|  to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November. Fawkes had taken up his station late on the previous night, armed with a slow match and a watch given to him by Percy becaus he should knowe howe the time went away . He was found leaving the cellar, shortly after midnight, and arrested. Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.       Fawkes gave his name as John Johnson and was first interrogated by members of the Kings  |Privy_chamber|Privy_Chamber| , where he remained defiant.  When asked by one of the lords what he was doing in possession of so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered that his intention was to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains.  He identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his fathers name as Thomas and his mothers as Edith Jackson. Wounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of  |pleurisy|Pleurisy| . Fawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so. His steadfast manner earned him the admiration of King James, who described Fawkes as possessing a Roman resolution .     Jamess admiration did not, however, prevent him from ordering on 6 November that John Johnson be tortured, to reveal the names of his co-conspirators. He directed that the torture be light at first, referring to the use of  |manacles|Handcuffs| , but more severe if necessary, authorising the use of  |the_rack|Rack| et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur .  Fawkes was transferred to the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London| . The King composed a list of questions to be put to Johnson , such as as to what he is, For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him , When and where he learned to speak French? , and If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it?  The room in which Fawkes was interrogated subsequently became known as the Guy Fawkes Room.         |Sir_William_Waad|William_Wade| , Lieutenant of the Tower, supervised the torture and obtained Fawkess confession. He searched his prisoner, and found a letter addressed to Guy Fawkes. To Waads surprise, Johnson remained silent, revealing nothing about the plot or its authors. On the night of 6 November he spoke with Waad, who reported to Salisbury He told us that since he undertook this action he did every day pray to God he might perform that which might be for the advancement of the Catholic Faith and saving his own soul . According to Waad, Fawkes managed to rest through the night, despite his being warned that he would be interrogated until I had gotton the inwards secret of his thoughts and all his complices . His composure was broken at some point during the following day.     The observer Sir Edward Hoby remarked Since Johnsons being in the Tower, he beginneth to speak English . Fawkes revealed his true identity on 7 November, and told his interrogators that there were five people involved in the plot to kill the King. He began to reveal their names on 8 November, and told how they intended to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne. His third confession, on 9 November, implicated  |Francis_Tresham|Francis_Tresham| . Following the  |Ridolfi_plot|Ridolfi_Plot|  of 1571 prisoners were made to dictate their confessions, before copying and signing them, if they still could. Although it is uncertain if he was tortured on the rack, Fawkess scrawled signature suggests the suffering he endured at the hands of his interrogators.       The trial of eight of the plotters began on Monday 27 January 1606. Fawkes shared the barge from the Tower to  |Westminster_Hall|Westminster_Hall|  with seven of his co-conspirators. They were kept in the  |Star_Chamber|Star_Chamber|  before being taken to Westminster Hall, where they were displayed on a purpose-built scaffold. The King and his close family, watching in secret, were among the spectators as the Lords Commissioners read out the list of charges. Fawkes was identified as Guido Fawkes, otherwise called Guido Johnson . He pleaded not guilty, despite his apparent acceptance of guilt from the moment he was captured.        The jury found all the defendants guilty, and the  |Lord_Chief_Justice|Lord_Chief_Justice_Of_England_And_Wales|  Sir  |John_Popham|John_Popham|  pronounced them guilty of  |high_treason|High_Treason| . The  |Attorney_General|Attorney_General_For_England_And_Wales| |Sir_Edward_Coke|Edward_Coke|  told the court that each of the condemned would be  |drawn_backwards|Hanged,_Drawn,_And_Quartered|  to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. They were to be put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both . Their genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed. They would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become prey for the fowls of the air .  Fawkess and Treshams testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot. The last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells. The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy. When the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.     On 31 January 1606, Fawkes and three others  – Thomas Wintour,  |Ambrose_Rookwood|Ambrose_Rookwood| , and Robert Keyes  – were dragged  from the Tower on wattled  |hurdles|Hurdle|  to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had attempted to destroy. His fellow plotters were then hanged and quartered. Fawkes was the last to stand on the scaffold. He asked for forgiveness of the King and state, while keeping up his crosses and idle ceremonies . Weakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck.  His lifeless body was nevertheless quartered and, as was the custom, his body parts were then distributed to the four corners of the kingdom , to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.                 On 5 November 1605, Londoners were encouraged to celebrate the Kings escape from assassination by lighting bonfires, provided that this testemonye of joy be carefull done without any danger or disorder .  |An_Act_of_Parliament|Observance_Of_5Th_November_Act_1605|  designated each 5 November as a day of thanksgiving for the joyful day of deliverance , and remained in force until 1859.  Fawkes was one of 13  conspirators, but he is the individual most associated with the plot.     In Britain, 5 November has variously been called  |Guy_Fawkes_Night|Guy_Fawkes_Night| , Guy Fawkes Day, Plot Night, and Bonfire Night . Bonfires were accompanied by fireworks from the 1650s onwards, and it became the custom after 1673 to burn an effigy when heir presumptive  |James,_Duke_of_York|James_Ii_Of_England| , converted to Catholicism. Effigies of other notable figures have found their way onto the bonfires, such as  |Paul_Kruger|Paul_Kruger|  and  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher| , although most modern effigies are of Fawkes. The guy is normally created by children from old clothes, newspapers, and a mask. During the 19th century, guy came to mean an oddly dressed person, while in many places it has lost any pejorative connotation and instead refers to any male person and the plural form can refer to people of any gender . , entry guy     James Sharpe, professor of history at the University of York, has described how Guy Fawkes came to be toasted as the last man to enter Parliament with honest intentions .  |William_Harrison_Ainsworths|William_Harrison_Ainsworth|  1841 historical romance  Guy Fawkes; or, The Gunpowder Treason  portrays Fawkes in a generally sympathetic light,  and his novel transformed Fawkes in the public perception into an acceptable fictional character . Fawkes subsequently appeared as essentially an action hero in childrens books and  |penny_dreadfuls|Penny_Dreadful|  such as The Boyhood Days of Guy Fawkes; or, The Conspirators of Old London, published around 1905.  According to historian  |Lewis_Call|Lewis_Call| , Fawkes is now a major icon in modern political culture whose face has become a potentially powerful instrument for the articulation of postmodern anarchism  in the late 20th century.
