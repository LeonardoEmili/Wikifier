The Nation  described her verse as caked with a salty humor, rough with splinters of disillusion, and tarred with a bright black authenticity . Meade 177 Although some critics, notably  The New York Times  reviewer, dismissed her work as  |flapper|Flapper|  verse , Meade 178 the volume helped affirm Parkers reputation for sparkling wit.
