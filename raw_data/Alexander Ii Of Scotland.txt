           Alexander II  was  |King_of_Scotland|King_Of_Scotland|  from 1214 until his death. He concluded the  |Treaty_of_York|Treaty_Of_York|  which defined the boundary between England and Scotland, virtually unchanged today.         He was born at  |Haddington,_East_Lothian|Haddington,_East_Lothian| , the only son of the Scottish king  |William_the_Lion|William_The_Lion|  and  |Ermengarde_of_Beaumont|Ermengarde_Of_Beaumont| . He spent time in England  before succeeding to the kingdom on the death of his father on 4 December 1214, being crowned at  |Scone|Scone,_Perth_And_Kinross|  on 6 December the same year.         In 1215, the year after his accession, the clans  |Meic_Uilleim|Meic_Uilleim|  and  |MacHeths|Macheths| , inveterate enemies of the Scottish crown, broke into revolt; but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection. In the same year Alexander joined the English barons in their struggle against  |John_of_England|John_Of_England| , and led an army into the  |Kingdom_of_England|Kingdom_Of_England|  in support of their cause.  This action led to the sacking of  |Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick-Upon-Tweed|  as Johns forces ravaged the north.     The Scottish forces reached the south coast of England at the port of  |Dover|Dover|  where in September 1216, Alexander paid homage to the pretender  |Prince_Louis_of_France|Louis_Viii_Of_France|  for his lands in England, chosen by the barons to replace King John. But  |King_John|John_Of_England|  having died, the Pope and the English aristocracy changed their allegiance to his nine-year-old son,  |Henry|Henry_Iii_Of_England| , forcing the French and the Scots armies to return home.      Peace between Henry III, Louis of France, and Alexander followed on 12 September 1217 with the  |Treaty_of_Kingston|Treaty_Of_Lambeth| . Diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of Alexander to Henrys sister  |Joan_of_England|Joan_Of_England,_Queen_Consort_Of_Scotland|  on 18 June or 25 June 1221.     In 1222  |Jon_Haraldsson|Jon_Haraldsson| , the last native Scandinavian to be  |Jarl_of_Orkney|Earl_Of_Orkneynorse_Earls| , was indirectly implicated in the burning of  |Bishop_Adam|Adam_Of_Melrose|  at his hall at  |Halkirk|Halkirk|  by local farmers when this part of  |Caithness|Caithness|  was still part of the  |Kingdom_of_Norway|Scandinavian_Scotlandcaithness_And_Sutherland| . A contemporary chronicler,  |Boethius_the_Dane|Boetius_Of_Dacia|  blamed Haraldsson for the bishops death. After the Jarl swore oaths to his own innocence, Alexander took the opportunity to assert his claims to the mainland part of the Orkney jarldom. He visited Caithness in person, and hanged the majority of the farmers while mutilating the rest. His actions were applauded by  |Pope_Honorius_III|Pope_Honorius_Iii| , and a quarter of a century later, he was continuing to receive commendation from the  |Vatican|Catholic_Church| , as in the reward of a  |bull|Papal_Bull|  from  |Celestine_IV|Pope_Celestine_Iv| .          During the same period, Alexander subjugated the hitherto semi-independent district of  |Argyll|Argyll|  . Royal forces crushed a revolt in  |Galloway|Galloway|  in 1235 without difficulty; nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success. Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of England drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties. The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in 1237. This was the Treaty of York, which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the Solway Firth and the mouth of the River Tweed .     Alexanders first wife  |Joan_of_England|Joan_Of_England,_Queen_Of_Scotland|  died in March 1238 in Essex, and was buried in Dorset. Alexander married his second wife,  |Marie_de_Coucy|Marie_De_Coucy| , the following year on 15 May 1239. Together they had one son, the future  |Alexander_III|Alexander_Iii_Of_Scotland| , born in 1241.     A threat of invasion by Henry in 1243 for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries; but the prompt action of Alexander in anticipating his attack, and the disinclination of the English barons for war, compelled him to  |make_peace|Treaty_Of_Newcastle|  next year at  |Newcastle|Newcastle_Upon_Tyne| .     Alexander now turned his attention to securing the  |Western_Isles|Western_Isles| , which were still part of the Norwegian domain of  |Suðreyjar|Scandinavian_Scotlandgeography| . He repeatedly attempted negotiations and purchase, but without success. Alexander set out to conquer these islands but died on the way in 1249.  This dispute over the Western Isles, also known as the  |Hebrides|Hebrides| , was not resolved until 1266 when  |Magnus_VI_of_Norway|Magnus_Vi_Of_Norway|  ceded them to Scotland along with the  |Isle_of_Man|Isle_Of_Man| .      The English chronicler  |Matthew_Paris|Matthew_Paris|  in his  Chronica Majora  described Alexander as red-haired:     taunted King Alexander, and because he was red-headed, sent word to him, saying, so shall we hunt the red fox-cub from his lairs. Scottish annals from English chroniclers A.D.500 to 1286, Alan Orr Anderson, Paul Watkins, 1991.                Alexander attempted to persuade  |Ewen|Ewen_Macdougall| , the son of Duncan, Lord of  |Argyll|Argyll| , to sever his allegiance to  |Haakon_IV_of_Norway|Haakon_Iv_Of_Norway| . When Ewen rejected these attempts, Alexander sailed forth to compel him, but on the way he suffered a fever at the Isle of  |Kerrera|Kerrera|  in the  |Inner_Hebrides|Inner_Hebrides| . He died there in 1249 and was buried at  |Melrose_Abbey|Melrose_Abbey| .     He was succeeded by his son, the seven-year-old  |Alexander_III_of_Scotland|Alexander_Iii_Of_Scotland| .       Alexander II had two wives:     1.  Joan of England , , was the eldest legitimate daughter and third child of  |John_of_England|John_Of_England|  and  |Isabella_of_Angoulême|Isabella_Of_Angoulême| . She and Alexander II married on 21 June 1221, at  |York_Minster|York_Minster| . Alexander was 23. Joan was 11. They had no children. Joan was Alexanders 3rd cousin, their closest common ancestor being  |Henry_I_of_England|Henry_I_Of_England| . Joan died in  |Essex|Essex|  in 1238, and was buried at  |Tarant_Crawford_Abbey|Tarant_Crawford_Abbey|  in  |Dorset|Dorset| .     2.  Marie de Coucy , who became mother of  |Alexander_III_of_Scotland|Alexander_Iii_Of_Scotland| . She was Alexanders third cousin once removed by their common ancestor  |Hugh,_Count_of_Vermandois|Hugh,_Count_Of_Vermandois| .     He also had an illegitimate daughter Marjorie, who married  |Alan_Durward|Alan_Durward| .         Alexander II has been depicted in historical novels:     Sword of State by  |Nigel_Tranter|Nigel_Tranter| . The novel depicts the friendship between Alexander II and  |Patrick_II,_Earl_of_Dunbar|Patrick_Ii,_Earl_Of_Dunbar| . Their friendship withstands treachery, danger and rivalry .
