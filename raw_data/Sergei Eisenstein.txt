        Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein  was a  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| |film_director|Film_Director|  and  |film_theorist|Film_Theory| , a pioneer in the theory and practice of  |montage|Montage| . He is noted in particular for his  |silent_films|Silent_Film|   Strike  ,  Battleship Potemkin  and  October  , as well as the  |historical|Historical_Movie| |epics|Epic_Film|   Alexander Nevsky  and  Ivan the Terrible  . In its decennial poll, the magazine  Sight & Sound  named his Battleship Potemkin the 11th greatest movie of all time.           Eisenstein  was born to a middle-class family in  |Riga|Riga| , Latvia , but his family moved frequently in his early years, as Eisenstein continued to do throughout his life. His father, the famous architect  |Mikhail_Osipovich_Eisenstein|Mikhail_Eisenstein| , was born in  |Kiev_Oblast|Kiev_Oblast| , to a  |Jewish|Jews|  merchant father, Osip, and his  |Swedish|Sweden|  wife.   |Russian|Russians| |Orthodox|Orthodox_Christian|  family.   She was the daughter of a prosperous merchant.  Julia left Riga the same year as the  |Russian_Revolution_of_1905|Russian_Revolution| , taking Sergei with her to St. Petersburg.  Her son would return at times to see his father, who joined them around 1910.  Divorce followed and Julia left the family to live in France.  Eisenstein was raised as an Orthodox Christian, but became an atheist later on.       At the  |Petrograd|Petrograd|  Institute of Civil Engineering, Eisenstein studied architecture and engineering, the profession of his father.  In 1918, he left school and joined the  |Red_Army|Red_Army|  to serve the  |Bolshevik_Revolution|Russian_Revolution| , although his father Mikhail supported the opposite side.  This brought his father to Germany after the defeat of the Tsarist government, and Sergei to Petrograd,  |Vologda|Vologda| , and  |Dvinsk|Dvinsk| .  In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in  |Minsk|Minsk| , after success providing  |propaganda|Propaganda|  for the  |October_Revolution|October_Revolution| . At this time, he was exposed to  |Kabuki|Kabuki|  theatre and studied  |Japanese|Japanese_Language| , learning some 300  |kanji|Kanji|  characters, which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development.    These studies would lead him to travel to  |Japan|Japan| .            Eisenstein moved to Moscow in 1920, and began his career in theatre working for  |Proletkult|Proletkult| .  His productions there were entitled Gas Masks, Listen Moscow, and  Wiseman .  He worked as a designer for  |Vsevolod_Meyerhold|Vsevolod_Meyerhold| .  Eisenstein began his career as a theorist in 1923,  by writing The Montage of Attractions for art journal  LEF .  His first film,  Glumovs Diary  , was also made in that same year with  |Dziga_Vertov|Dziga_Vertov|  hired initially as an instructor         Strike  was Eisensteins first full-length feature film.  Battleship Potemkin  was critically acclaimed worldwide. Mostly owing to this international renown, he was then able to direct  October   as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the  |October_Revolution|October_Revolution|  of 1917, and then  The General Line  . While critics outside Soviet Russia praised these works, Eisensteins focus in the films on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements, and  |montage|Montage|  brought him and like-minded others such as  |Vsevolod_Pudovkin|Vsevolod_Pudovkin|  and  |Alexander_Dovzhenko|Alexander_Dovzhenko|  under fire from the Soviet film community. This forced him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of  |socialist_realism|Socialist_Realism| .       In the autumn of 1928, with October still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator  |Grigori_Aleksandrov|Grigori_Aleksandrov|  and cinematographer  |Eduard_Tisse|Eduard_Tisse| . Officially, the trip was supposed to allow the three to learn about sound motion pictures and to present themselves as Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zürich, London, and Paris.  In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Tisse, entitled Frauennot – Frauenglück.        In late April 1930,  |Jesse_L._Lasky|Jesse_L._Lasky| , on behalf of  |Paramount_Pictures|Paramount_Pictures| , offered Eisenstein the opportunity to make a film in the United States.  He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930, along with Aleksandrov and Tisse.     Eisenstein proposed a biography of munitions tycoon  |Basil_Zaharoff|Basil_Zaharoff|  and a film version of  Arms and the Man  by  |George_Bernard_Shaw|George_Bernard_Shaw| , and more fully developed plans for a film of  Sutters Gold  by  |Blaise_Cendrars|Blaise_Cendrars| ,  but on all accounts failed to impress the studios producers.  Paramount proposed a film version of  |Theodore_Dreisers|Theodore_Dreiser|   An American Tragedy .  This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930,  but Paramount disliked it completely and, additionally, found themselves intimidated by Major  |Frank_Pease|Frank_Pease| ,  president of the Hollywood Technical Directors Institute. Pease, an anti-communist, mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, by mutual consent , Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void, and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramounts expense.      Eisenstein was thus faced with returning home a failure. The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him; in addition, his films, techniques and theories, such as his  |formalist_film_theory|Formalist_Film_Theory| , were becoming increasingly attacked as ideological failures. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as  Eisenstein on Disney , have surfaced decades later as seminal scholarly texts used as curriculum in film schools around the world.     Eisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin| ,  who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor in the person of American socialist author  |Upton_Sinclair|Upton_Sinclair| .  Sinclairs works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR, and were known to Eisenstein. The two admired each other, and between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisensteins absences from the USSR, and permission for him to travel to Mexico. The trip to Mexico was for Eisenstein to make a film produced by Sinclair and his wife  |Mary|Mary_Craig_Sinclair| , and three other investors organized as the Mexican Film Trust .              On 24 November 1930, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisensteins artistic integrity.  The contract also stipulated that the film would be non-political , that immediately available funding came from Mary Sinclair in an amount of not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ,  that the shooting schedule amounted to a period of from three to four months , and most importantly that: Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair... A codicil to the contract allowed that the Soviet Government may have the film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R.  Reportedly, it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hours duration.     By 4 December, Eisenstein was en route to Mexico by train, accompanied by Aleksandrov and Tisse. Later he produced a brief synopsis of the six-part film; this would come, in one form or another, to be the final plan he would settle on for his project. The title for the project, ¡Que viva México!, was decided on some time later still. Whilst in Mexico, he mixed socially with  |Frida_Kahlo|Frida_Kahlo|  and  |Diego_Rivera|Diego_Rivera| ; Eisenstein admired these artists and Mexican culture in general, and they inspired him to call his films moving frescoes .  The left-wing U.S. film community eagerly followed his progress within Mexico, as is chronicled within Chris Robes book Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture. Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture     After a prolonged absence,  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  sent a telegram expressing the concern that Eisenstein had become a deserter.  Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclairs younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along to act as a line producer, for the films problems.  Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot; estimates of the extent of this range from 170,000 lineal feet with Soldadera unfilmed,  to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet.      For the unfinished filming of the novel of Soldadera, without incurring any cost, Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army, but this was lost due to Sinclairs cancelling of production. When Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of  |Jesus|Jesus|  caricatures amongst other lewd pornographic material.   His re-entry visa had expired,  and Sinclairs contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Aleksandrov, and Tisse were allowed, after a months stay at the  |U.S.-Mexico_border|U.S.-Mexico_Border|  outside  |Laredo,_Texas|Laredo,_Texas| , a 30-day pass to get from Texas to New York, and thence depart for Moscow, while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film.     Eisenstein toured the American South on his way to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of  |Sol_Lesser|Sol_Lesser| , who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative—at the Sinclairs expense—and distribute any resulting product. Two short  |feature_films|Feature_Film|  and a  |short_subject|Short_Subject| —Thunder Over Mexico based on the Maguey footage,  Eisenstein in Mexico, and Death Day respectively—were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934. Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer,  |Marie_Seton|Marie_Seton| , called  Time in the Sun ,  released in 1940. He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project. In 1978, Gregori Aleksandrov released – with the same name in contravention to the copyright – his own version, which was awarded the Honorable Golden Prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979. Later, in 1998, Oleg Kovalov edited a free version of the film, calling it Mexican Fantasy .          Eisensteins foray into the West made the staunchly Stalinist film industry look upon him with a suspicion that would never completely disappear. He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in  |Kislovodsk|Kislovodsk|  in July 1933,  ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage.  He was subsequently assigned a teaching position at the  |State_Institute_of_Cinematography|Gerasimov_Institute_Of_Cinematography|  where he had taught earlier, and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing the curriculum.      In 1935, Eisenstein was assigned another project,  Bezhin Meadow , but it appears the film was afflicted with many of the same problems as ¡Que viva México!. Eisenstein unilaterally decided to film two versions of the scenario, one for adult viewers and one for children; failed to define a clear shooting schedule; and shot film prodigiously, resulting in cost overruns and missed deadlines.  |Boris_Shumyatsky|Boris_Shumyatsky| , the de facto head of the Soviet film industry, finally called a halt to the filming and cancelled further production. What appeared to save Eisensteins career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the Bezhin Meadow catastrophe, along with several other problems facing the industry at that point, had less to do with Eisensteins approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him. Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of Shumyatsky,  who in early 1938 was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot.       Eisenstein was thence able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for one more chance, and he chose, from two offerings, the assignment of a biopic of  Alexander Nevsky , with music composed by  |Sergei_Prokofiev|Sergei_Prokofiev| .  This time, he was assigned a co-scenarist,  |Pyotr_Pavlenko|Pyotr_Pavlenko| ,  to bring in a completed script; professional actors to play the roles; and an assistant director,  |Dmitri_Vasilyev|Dmitri_Ivanovich_Vasilyev| , to expedite shooting.     The result was a film critically well received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the  |Order_of_Lenin|Order_Of_Lenin|  and the  |Stalin_Prize|State_Stalin_Prize| .  It was an allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and well made. The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian  |proverbs|Proverb| , verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions. Kevin McKenna. 2009.

This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented not only Eisensteins first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film.     Within months of its release, Stalin entered into a  |pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop_Pact|  with Hitler, and Alexander Nevsky was promptly pulled from distribution. Eisenstein returned to teaching, and was assigned to direct  |Richard_Wagners|Richard_Wagner|   Die Walküre  at the  |Bolshoi_Theatre|Bolshoi_Theatre| . After the outbreak of war with Germany in 1941, Alexander Nevsky was re-released with a wide distribution and earned international success. With the war approaching Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to  |Alma-Ata|Almaty| , where he first considered the idea of making a film about Tsar Ivan IV. Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma-Ata, and was joined by him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed  |the_score|Ivan_The_Terrible|  for Eisensteins film and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of  War and Peace  that Prokofiev was developing.        Eisensteins film  Ivan the Terrible , Part I, presenting  |Ivan_IV_of_Russia|Ivan_The_Terrible|  as a national hero, won Stalins approval ,  but the sequel, Ivan The Terrible, Part II, was criticized by various authorities and went unreleased until 1958. All footage from Ivan The Terrible, Part III was confiscated whilst the film was still incomplete, and most of it was destroyed, though several filmed scenes exist.         In 1934, in the Soviet Union, Eisenstein married filmmaker and screenwriter Pera Atasheva .    There have been debates about Eisensteins sexuality, with a film covering Eisensteins homosexuality allegedly running into difficulties in Russia.   Eisenstein never publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, but it has long been a subject of debate.  .       Eisenstein suffered a  |heart_attack|Myocardial_Infarction|  on 2 February 1946, and spent much of the following year recovering. He died of a second heart attack on 11 February 1948, at the age of 50.  His body lay in state in the Hall of the Cinema Workers before being cremated on 13 February, and his ashes were buried in the  |Novodevichy_Cemetery|Novodevichy_Cemetery|  in Moscow.        Eisenstein was a pioneer in the use of  |montage|Soviet_Montage_Theory| , a specific use of  |film_editing|Film_Editing| . He and his contemporary  |Lev_Kuleshov|Lev_Kuleshov| , two of the earliest film theorists, argued that montage was the essence of the cinema. His articles and books—particularly Film Form and The Film Sense—explain the significance of montage in detail.     His writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment, through a linkage of related images. Eisenstein felt the collision of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors. He believed that an idea should be derived from the juxtaposition of two independent shots, bringing an element of collage into film. He developed what he called methods of montage :   Metric    Rhythmic    Tonal    Overtonal    Intellectual      Eisenstein taught film-making during his career at GIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors course;  his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhniĭs Lessons with Eisenstein. Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as  |Honoré_de_Balzacs|Honoré_De_Balzac|   Le Père Goriot .  Another hypothetical was the staging of the  |Haiti|Haiti| an struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradovs The Black Consul,  influenced as well by John Vandercooks Black Majesty.      Lessons from this scenario delved into the character of  |Jean-Jacques_Dessalines|Jean-Jacques_Dessalines| , replaying his movements, actions, and the drama surrounding him. Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content, Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing, photography, and editing, while encouraging his students development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity.  Eisensteins pedagogy, like his films, was politically charged and contained quotes from  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin|  interwoven with his teaching.      In his initial films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues, especially  |class_conflict|Class_Conflict| . He used stock characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes; he avoided casting  |stars|Movie_Star| .  Eisensteins vision of  |communism|Communism|  brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling regime of Stalin. Like many  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik|  artists, Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists totally, freeing them from the confines of bosses and budgets, leaving them absolutely free to create, but budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world. Due to the fledgling war, the revolution-wracked and isolated new nation didnt have the resources to nationalize its film industry at first. When it did, limited resources—both monetary and equipment—required production controls as extensive as in the capitalist world.  |Stalin_Prizes|State_Stalin_Prize|  – 1941 for the film  Alexander Nevsky  , 1946 for the first film of the series  Ivan the Terrible    Honored Artist of the  |RSFSR|Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic| |Order_of_Lenin|Order_Of_Lenin|  – for the film Alexander Nevsky     |Order_of_the_Badge_of_Honour|Order_Of_The_Badge_Of_Honour| |Google_Doodle|Google_Doodle|  – The doodle was released in celebration of his 120th birthday.           1923 Дневник Глумова    1925 Стачка    1925 Броненосец Потёмкин    1927 Октябрь «Десять дней, которые потрясли мир»    1929 Штурм Ля Сарраса    1929 Старое и новое «Генеральная линия»    1929 Frauennot - Frauenglück   1930  Romance sentimentale    1931 El Desastre en Oaxaca   1932 Да здравствует Мексика!    1937 Бежин луг    1938 Александр Невский    1944 Иван Грозный 1-я серия    1945 Иван Грозный 2-я серия         .   ; translated by Jay Leyda.
