               Dubnium is a  |synthetic|Synthetic_Element| |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Db and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  105. Dubnium is highly radioactive: the most stable known  |isotope|Isotopes_Of_Dubnium| , dubnium-268, has a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of about 28 hours. This greatly limits the extent of research on dubnium.     Dubnium does not occur naturally on Earth and is produced artificially. The Soviet  |Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research|Joint_Institute_For_Nuclear_Research|  claimed the first discovery of the element in 1968, followed by the American  |Lawrence_Berkeley_Laboratory|Lawrence_Berkeley_Laboratory|  in 1970. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the  |IUPAC/IUPAP_Joint_Working_Party|Iupac/Iupap_Joint_Working_Party| , resulting in credit for the discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was formally named dubnium in 1997 after the town of  |Dubna|Dubna| , the site of the JINR.     Theoretical research establishes dubnium as a member of  |group_5|Group_5_Element|  in the 6d series of  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal| , placing it under  |vanadium|Vanadium| ,  |niobium|Niobium| , and  |tantalum|Tantalum| . Dubnium should share most properties, such as its valence  |electron_configuration|Electron_Configuration|  and having a dominant +5 oxidation state, with the other group 5 elements, with a few anomalies due to  |relativistic_effects|Relativistic_Effects| . A limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has confirmed this. Solution chemistry experiments have revealed that dubnium often behaves more like niobium rather than tantalum, breaking  |periodic_trends|Periodic_Trends| .          |Uranium|Uranium| , element 92, is the heaviest element to occur in significant quantity in nature; heavier elements can only be produced practically by synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element— |neptunium|Neptunium| , element 93—was achieved in 1940 by a team of researchers in the United States.  In the following years, American scientists synthesized the elements up to  |mendelevium|Mendelevium| , element 101, which was synthesized in 1955. From  |element_102|Nobelium| , the priority of discoveries was contested between American and Soviet physicists.  Their rivalry resulted in a race for new elements and credit for their discoveries, later named the  |Transfermium_Wars|Transfermium_Wars| .           The first report of the  |discovery_of_element_105|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  came from the  |Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research|Joint_Institute_For_Nuclear_Research|  in  |Dubna|Dubna| ,  |Moscow_Oblast|Moscow_Oblast| ,  |Russian_SFSR|Russian_Sfsr| ,  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , in April 1968.
