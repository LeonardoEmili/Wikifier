             Phospholipids are a class of  |lipids|Lipids|  that are a major component of all  |cell_membranes|Cell_Membrane| . They can form  |lipid_bilayers|Lipid_Bilayer|  because of their  |amphiphilic|Amphiphilic|  characteristic. The structure of the phospholipid molecule generally consists of two  |hydrophobic|Hydrophobic|  fatty acid tails and a  |hydrophilic|Hydrophile|  head consisting of a  |phosphate|Phosphate|  group. The two components are usually joined together by a  |glycerol|Glycerol|  molecule. The phosphate groups can be modified with simple organic molecules such as  |choline|Choline| ,  |ethanolamine|Ethanolamine|  or  |serine|Serine| .     The first phospholipid identified in 1847 as such in biological tissues was  |lecithin|Lecithin| , or  |phosphatidylcholine|Phosphatidylcholine| , in the egg yolk of chickens by the French chemist and pharmacist  |Theodore_Nicolas_Gobley|Theodore_Nicolas_Gobley| .  |Biological_membranes|Biological_Membrane|  in eukaryotes also contain another class of lipid,  |sterol|Sterol| , interspersed among the phospholipids and together they provide membrane fluidity and mechanical strength. Purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in  |nanotechnology|Nanotechnology|  and  |materials_science|Materials_Science| .        An amphiphile is a term describing a chemical compound possessing both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties. The phospholipid head usually contains a negatively charged phosphate group and glycerol; it is hydrophilic. The phospholipid tails usually consist of 2 long  |fatty_acid|Fatty_Acid|  chains; they are hydrophobic and avoid interactions with water. When placed in aqueous solutions, phospholipids are driven by  |hydrophobic_interactions|Hydrophobic_Interactions|  that result in the fatty acid tails aggregating to minimize interactions with water molecules. These specific properties allow phospholipids to play an important role in the  |phospholipid_bilayer|Phospholipid_Bilayer| . In biological systems, the phospholipids often occur with other molecules  in a  |bilayer|Bilayer|  such as a  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane| .  Lipid bilayers occur when hydrophobic tails line up against one another, forming a membrane of hydrophilic heads on both sides facing the water.     Such movement can be described by the  |fluid_mosaic_model|Fluid_Mosaic_Model| , that describes the membrane as a mosaic of lipid molecules that act as a solvent for all the substances and proteins within it, so proteins and lipid molecules are then free to diffuse laterally through the lipid matrix and migrate over the membrane. Sterols contribute to membrane fluidity by hindering the packing together of phospholipids. However, this model has now been superseded, as through the study of  |lipid_polymorphism|Lipid_Polymorphism|  it is now known that the behaviour of lipids under physiological conditions is not simple.       :See: Glycerophospholipid   |Phosphatidic_acid|Phosphatidic_Acid| |Phosphatidylethanolamine|Phosphatidylethanolamine| |Phosphatidylcholine|Phosphatidylcholine| |Phosphatidylserine|Phosphatidylserine|    Phosphoinositides:    |Phosphatidylinositol|Phosphatidylinositol| |Phosphatidylinositol_phosphate|Phosphatidylinositol_Phosphate| |Phosphatidylinositol_bisphosphate|Phosphatidylinositol_-Bisphosphate|  and    |Phosphatidylinositol_trisphosphate|Phosphatidylinositol_-Trisphosphate|          See Sphingolipid   |Sphingomyelin|Sphingomyelin| SPH |Sphingomyelin|Sphingomyelin| Cer-PE |emist|Emist| |olo|Olo| NMR spectroscopy |GPAT|Glycerol-3-Phosphate_O-Acyltransferase|  and LPAAT acyl transferases, phosphatase and choline phosphotransferase |flippase|Flippase|  and floppasePIP 2 IP 3 DAG Sodium Salt1-glycerol...Sodium SaltSodium Salt1-glycerol...Sodium Salt1-glycerol...Ammonium SaltSodium SaltSodium Salt1-glycerol...Sodium Salt1-glycerol...Ammonium Salt1-glycerol...Sodium/Ammonium SaltSodium SaltSodium Saltlipid1-glycerol...Sodium SaltSodium SaltSodium Salt1-glycerol...Sodium Salt1-glycerol...Ammonium SaltSodium SaltSodium Salt1-glycerol...Sodium Salt1-glycerol...Ammonium SaltSodium Saltlipid1-glycerolSodium Saltlipid .
