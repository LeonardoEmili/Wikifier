        ", in his  Teutonic Mythology  , identifies Old Norse Baldr with the Old High German Baldere , Palter , Paltar and with Old English bealdor, baldor lord, prince, king . Old Norse shows this usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in baldur î brynju  and herbaldr , epithets of heroes in general.     Grimm traces the etymology of the name to balþaz, whence Gothic balþs, Old English bald, Old High German pald, all meaning bold, brave . Baldrs would in strictness appear to have no connexion with the Goth. balþs , nor Paltar with the OHG. pald, nor Baldr with the ON. ballr dangerous, dire. As a rule, the Gothic ld is represented by ON. ld and OHG. ltlþ by ON. ll and OHG. ld. But the OS. and AS. have ld in both cases, and even in Gothic, ON. and OHG. a root will sometimes appear in both forms in the same language; so that a close connexion between balþs and Baldrs, pald and Paltar, is possible after all.     But the interpretation of Baldr as the brave god may be secondary. Baltic  has a word meaning the white, the good , and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into ": null

This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning shining one, white one, a god derived from the meaning of Baltic baltas, further adducing Slavic  Belobog  and German  Berhta . Bæl-dæg itself is white-god, light-god, he that shines as sky and light and day, the kindly Bièlbôgh, Bèlbôgh of the Slav system. It is in perfect accord with this explanation of Bæl-dæg, that the Anglo-Saxon tale of ancestry assigns to him a son Brond, of whom the Edda is silent, brond, brand, ON. brandr , signifying jubar, fax, titio. Bældæg therefore, as regards his name, would agree with Berhta, the bright goddess.     Grimms etymology is endorsed by modern research.
