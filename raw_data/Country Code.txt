   Country codes are short alphabetic or numeric  |geographical|Geography| |codes|Code|   developed to represent  |countries|Country|  and  |dependent_areas|Dependent_Area| , for use in  |data_processing|Data_Processing|  and  |communications|Communication| . Several different systems have been developed to do this. The term country code frequently refers to  |ISO_3166-1_alpha-2|Iso_3166-1_Alpha-2|  or international dialing codes, the  |E.164|E.164| |country_calling_codes|List_Of_Country_Calling_Codes| .            This standard defines for most of the countries and dependent areas in the world:   a two-letter    a three-letter , and   a three-digit numeric  code.     The two-letter codes are used as the basis for some other codes or applications, for example,   for  |ISO_4217|Iso_4217| |currency|Currency|  codes and   with deviations, for country code  |top-level_domain|Top-Level_Domain|  names on the Internet:  |list_of_Internet_TLDs|List_Of_Internet_Tlds| .   For more applications see  |ISO_3166-1_alpha-2|Iso_3166-1_Alpha-2| .        |European_Union|European_Union| |2004_EU_enlargement|Enlargement_Of_The_European_Union|  the EU used the UN Road Traffic Conventions  |license_plate_codes|List_Of_International_License_Plate_Codes| ; since then, it uses  |ISO_3166-1|Iso_3166-1|   Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques  of the  |European_Union|European_Union| , mostly focusing on subdivisions of the EU member states    |FIFA|Fifa|  assigns a three-letter code to each of its member and non-member countries:  |List_of_FIFA_country_codes|List_Of_Fifa_Country_Codes| |Federal_Information_Processing_Standard|Federal_Information_Processing_Standard| |10-4|Fips_10-4|  defined two-letter codes used by the U.S. government and in the  |CIA_World_Factbook|Cia_World_Factbook| |list_of_FIPS_country_codes|List_Of_Fips_Country_Codes| . On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by  |NIST|Nist|  as a Federal Information Processing Standard.    The  |Bureau_of_Transportation_Statistics|Bureau_Of_Transportation_Statistics| , part of the  |United_States_Department_of_Transportation|United_States_Department_Of_Transportation|  , maintains its own list of codes, so-called  |World_Area_Codes|World_Area_Codes| , for state and country codes.    |GOST_7.67|Gost_7.67| |Cyrillic|Cyrillic|  from the  |GOST|Gost|  standards committee   From the  |International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|International_Civil_Aviation_Organization|  :    |The_national_prefixes_used_in_aircraft_registration_numbers|Aircraft_Registrationlist_Of_Countries/Regions_And_Their_Registration_Prefixes_And_Patterns| |Location_prefixes|International_Civil_Aviation_Organizationregistered_Codes|  in four-character  |ICAO_airport_codes|Icao_Airport_Code| |International_Olympic_Committee|International_Olympic_Committee|  three-letter codes used in sporting events:  |list_of_IOC_country_codes|List_Of_Ioc_Country_Codes| |International_Telecommunication_Union|International_Telecommunication_Union|  :   the  |E.164|E.164|  international telephone dialing codes:  |list_of_country_calling_codes|List_Of_Country_Calling_Codes|  with 1-3 digits,   the  |E.212|International_Mobile_Subscriber_Identity| |mobile_country_codes|Mobile_Country_Codes|  , for mobile/wireless phone addresses,   the first few characters of call signs of radio stations  define the country: the  |ITU_prefix|Itu_Prefix| ,    |ITU_letter_codes|Itu_Letter_Codes|  for member-countries,    |ITU_prefix_-_amateur_and_experimental_stations|Itu_Prefix_-_Amateur_And_Experimental_Stations|  - The  |International_Telecommunications_Union|International_Telecommunications_Union|  assigns national telecommunication prefixes for  |amateur|Amateur_Radio|  and experimental radio use, so that operators can be identified by their country of origin. These prefixes are legally administered by the national entity to which prefix ranges are assigned.   Three-digit codes used to identify countries in maritime mobile radio transmissions, known as  |maritime_identification_digits|Maritime_Identification_Digits| |License_plates|License_Plate|  for automobiles:   Under the 1949 and 1968 United Nations Road Traffic Conventions :  |List_of_international_license_plate_codes|List_Of_International_License_Plate_Codes| .    |Diplomatic_license_plates_in_the_United_States|Diplomatic_License_Plates_In_The_United_States| , assigned by the  |U.S._State_Department|United_States_Department_Of_State| .    |North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation|North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation|  used two-letter codes of its own:  |list_of_NATO_country_codes|List_Of_Nato_Country_Codes| . They were largely borrowed from the FIPS 10-4 codes mentioned below. In 2003 the eighth edition of the Standardisation Agreement adopted the ISO 3166 three-letter codes with one exception . With the ninth edition, NATO is transitioning to four- and six-letter codes based on ISO 3166 with a few exceptions and additions    |United_Nations_Development_Programme|United_Nations_Development_Programme|  also has its own list of  |trigram_country_codes|List_Of_Undp_Country_Codes| |World_Intellectual_Property_Organization|World_Intellectual_Property_Organization|  :  |WIPO_ST.3|Wipo_St.3|  gives two-letter codes to countries and regional intellectual property organizations    |World_Meteorological_Organization|World_Meteorological_Organization|  has its own list of country codes, used in reporting meteorological observations   UIC  |UIC_Country_Codes|Uic_Country_Code|      The developers of ISO 3166 intended that in time it would replace other coding systems in existence.       The following can represent countries:   The initial digits of International Standard Book Numbers  are group identifiers for countries, areas, or language regions.   The first three digits of  |GS1|Gs1|  Company Prefixes used to identify products, for example, in  |barcodes|Barcode| , designate numbering agencies.        |A|Country_Codes:_A|  -    |B|Country_Codes:_B|  -    |C|Country_Codes:_C|  -    |D–E|Country_Codes:_D–E|  -    |F|Country_Codes:_F|  -    |G|Country_Codes:_G|  -    |H–I|Country_Codes:_H–I|  -    |J–K|Country_Codes:_J–K|  -    |L|Country_Codes:_L|  -    |M|Country_Codes:_M|  -    |N|Country_Codes:_N|  -    |O–Q|Country_Codes:_O–Q|  -    |R|Country_Codes:_R|  -    |S|Country_Codes:_S|  -    |T|Country_Codes:_T|  -    |U–Z|Country_Codes:_U–Z|.
