           Anazarbus   was an ancient  |Cilicia|Cilicia| n city. Under the late Roman Empire, it was the capital of  |Cilicia_Secunda|Cilicia_Secunda| . It was destroyed in 1374.       It was situated in  |Anatolia|Anatolia|  in modern Turkey, in the present  |Çukurova|Çukurova|   about 15  km west of the main stream of the present  |Ceyhan_River|Ceyhan_River|   and near its tributary the  |Sempas_Su|Sempas_Su| .     A lofty isolated ridge formed its  |acropolis|Acropolis| . Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the  |Sudas|Suda|  identification of it with  |Cyinda|Cyinda| , famous as a treasure city in the wars of  |Eumenes_of_Cardia|Eumenes_Of_Cardia| , cannot be accepted in the face of  |Strabos|Strabo|  express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.        It was founded by  |Assyrians|Assyrian_People| . It was situated on the  |Pyramus|Pyramus| . According to the  Suda , the original name of the place was Cyinda or Kyinda or Quinda ; that it was next called Diocaesarea.  Suda , s.v. Κύϊνδα. How the city obtained the name Anazarbus or Anazarba , as it was also known, is a matter of conjecture. According to  |Stephanus_of_Byzantium|Stephanus_Of_Byzantium| , after the city was destroyed by an earthquake, the emperor  |Nerva|Nerva|  sent thither one Anazarbus, a man of senatorial rank, who rebuilt the city, and gave to it his own name.  This account cannot be accurate, as  |Valesius|Henri_Valois|  remarks, Amm. Marc. 14.8. for it was called Anazarbus in  |Plinys|Pliny_The_Elder|  time.   |Dioscorides|Dioscorides|  is called a native of Anazarbus; but the period of Dioscorides is not certain. It was also the home of the poet  |Oppian|Oppian| . Its later name was Caesarea ad Anazarbum, and there are many medals of the place in which it is both named Anazarbus and Caesarea at or under Anazarbus. On the division of Cilicia it became the chief place of the  |Roman_province|Roman_Province|  of  |Cilicia_Secunda|Cilicia_Secunda| , with the title of Metropolis. It suffered dreadfully from an earthquake both in the time of  |Eastern_Roman_emperor|Eastern_Roman_Emperor| |Justinian_I|Justinian_I| , and, still more, in the reign of his successor  |Justin_I|Justin_I| . After Justinian rebuilt the place, it was renamed Justinianopolis or Ioustinianoupolis . Rebuilt by  |Justin_I|Justin_I|  after the earthquake in the 6th century, it became Justinopolis or Ioustinoupolis ; but the old name persisted, and when  |Thoros_I|Thoros_I_Of_Armenia| , king of  |Lesser_Armenia|Lesser_Armenia| , made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as Anazarva.          Its great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the Sis pass, and near the great road which  |debouch|Debouch| ed from the  |Cilician_Gates|Cilician_Gates| , made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the  |Eastern_Roman_Empire|Eastern_Roman_Empire|  and the early Muslim invaders. It had been rebuilt by  |Harun_al-Rashid|Harun_Al-Rashid|  in 796, refortified at great expense by the  |Hamdanid|Hamdanid| |Sayf_al-Dawla|Sayf_Al-Dawla|  and again destroyed in 962 by  |Nikephoros_II_Phokas|Nikephoros_Ii_Phokas| .     In late 1097 or early 1098 it was captured by the armies of the  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade|  and was incorporated into Bohemonds Principality of Antioch. The Crusaders are probably responsible for the construction of an impressive donjon atop the center of the outcrop. Most of the remaining fortifications, including the curtain walls, massive horse-shaped towers, undercrofts, cisterns, and free-standing structures date from the Armenian periods of occupation, which began with the arrival of the  |Rubenid_Baron_T‛oros_I|Thoros_I,_Prince_Of_Armenia| , .  The site briefly exchanged hands between the Greeks and Armenians, until it was formally part of the  |Armenian_Kingdom_of_Cilicia|Armenian_Kingdom_Of_Cilicia| . Within the fortress are two Armenian chapels and the magnificent three-aisle church built by T‛oros I to celebrate his conquests. Robert W.

The church was once surrounded by a continuous, well-executed dedicatory inscription in Armenian.     The  |Mamluk|Mamluk|  Empire of Egypt finally destroyed the city in 1374.     The present wall of the lower city is of late construction. It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine  |triumphal_arch|Triumphal_Arch| , the colonnades of two streets, a  |gymnasium|Gymnasium| , etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south. The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock. There are no notable structures in the upper town. For picturesqueness the site is not equaled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine  |aqueducts|Aqueduct|  to their sources. A necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations.     A visit in December 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.     A modest Turkish farming village  lies to the southwest of the ancient city. A small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee. Also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field. Inquire at the museum for a viewing.     Anazarbus/Anavarsa was one of a chain of Armenian fortifications stretching through Cilicia. The  |castle_of_Sis|Sis|   lies to the north while Tumlu Castle and  |Yilankale|Yilankale|  are to the south, and the fortresses of  |Amouda|Amouda|  and  |Sarvandikar|Sarvandikar|  are to the east.     In 2013, excavations uncovered the first known colonnaded double-lane road of the ancient world, 34 meters wide and 2700 meters long, also uncovered the ruins of a church and a bathhouse.      In 2017, archaeologists discovered a limestone statue of the goddess  |Hygieia|Hygieia|  and the god  |Eros|Eros| . The statue is thought to date to the third or fourth century B.C.         Anazarbus was the capital and so also from 553  the  |metropolitan_see|Metropolitan_See|  of the Late  |Roman_province|Roman_Province|  of  |Cilicia_Secunda|Cilicia_Secunda| .

In the 4th century, one of the bishops of Anazarbus was Athanasius, a consistent expounder of the theology of Arius. His theological opponent, Athanasius of Alexandria, in De Synodis 17, 1 refers to Anazarbus as Ναζαρβῶν. R. P. C. Hanson, The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God: The Arian Controversy 318-381 , 41-3, quote, 43.     A 6th century  Notitia Episcopatuum  indicates that it had as  |suffragan|Suffragan|  sees  |Epiphania|Epiphania,_Cilicia| ,  |Alexandria_Minor|Alexandria_Minor| ,  |Irenopolis|Irenopolis,_Cilicia| ,  |Flavias|Flavias| ,  |Castabala|Castabala|  and  |Aegeae|Aegeae| .  |Rhosus|Arsuz|  was also subject to Anazarbus, but after the 6th century was made exempt, and  |Mopsuestia|Mopsuestia|  was raised to the rank of  |autcephalous|Autcephalous| |metropolitan_see|Metropolitan_See| , though without suffragans.
