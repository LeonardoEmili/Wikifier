        The MOS Technology 6510 is an  |8_bit|8_Bit| |_microprocessor|Microprocessor|  designed by  |MOS_Technology|Mos_Technology| . It is a modified form of the very successful  |6502|Mos_Technology_6502| . The 6510 was only widely used in the  |Commodore_64|Commodore_64| |_home_computer|Home_Computer|  and its variants.     The primary change from the 6502 was the addition of an 8-bit general purpose  |I_O|Input_Output|  port, although only six I/O pins were available in the most common version of the 6510. In addition, the address bus could be made  |tristate|Three_State_Logic| .       In the C64, the extra I/O pins of the processor were used to control the computers  |memory_map|Memory_Map|  by  |bank_switching|Bank_Switching| , and for controlling three of the four signal lines of the  |Datasette|Commodore_Datasette|  tape recorder . It was possible, by writing the correct  |bit_pattern|Bit_Pattern|  to the processor at address $01, to completely expose almost the full 64   |KB|Kilobyte|  of  |RAM|Random_Access_Memory|  in the C64, leaving no  |ROM|Read_Only_Memory|  or  |I_O|I_O|  hardware exposed except for the processor I/O port itself and its data directional register.               In 1985, MOS produced the 8500, an  |HMOS|Hmos|  version of the 6510. Other than the process modification, it is virtually identical to the  |NMOS|Nmos_Logic|  version of the 6510. The 8500 was originally designed for use in the modernised C64, the C64C. However, in 1985, limited quantities of 8500s were found on older NMOS-based C64s. It finally made its official debut in 1987, appearing in a motherboard using the new 85xx HMOS chipset.       The 7501/8501 variant of the 6510 was introduced in 1984.  Hardware â€“ MOS 7501/8501 Compared to the 6510, this variant extends the number of I/O port pins from 6 to 8, but omits the pins for non-maskable interrupt and clock output.  CPU 7501 / 8501 . It was used in Commodores  |C16|Commodore_16| ,  |C116|Commodore_16|  and  |Plus_4|Commodore_Plus_4|  home computers, where its I/O port controlled not only the  |Datasette|Commodore_Datasette|  but also the  |CBM_Bus|Commodore_1541Interface|  interface. The main difference between 7501 and 8501 CPUs is that they were manufactured with slightly different processes: 7501 was manufactured with  |HMOS_1|Hmos|  and 8501 with HMOS-2.       The 2   |MHz|Hertz| -capable  |8502|Mos_Technology_8502|  variant was used in the  |Commodore_128|Commodore_128| . All these CPUs are  |opcode|Opcode|  compatible .        The  |Commodore_1551|Commodore_1551|  disk drive used the 6510T, a version of the 6510 with eight I/O lines. The  |NMI|Non_Maskable_Interrupt| .
