      Andrew II , also known as Andrew of Jerusalem, was  |King_of_Hungary|King_Of_Hungary|  and  |Croatia|King_Of_Croatia|  between 1205 and 1235. He ruled the  |Principality_of_Halych|Principality_Of_Halych|  from 1188 until 1189/1190, and again between 1208/1209 and 1210. He was the younger son of  |Béla_III_of_Hungary|Béla_Iii_Of_Hungary| , who entrusted him with the administration of the newly conquered Principality of Halych in 1188. Andrews rule was unpopular, and the  |boyars|Boyar|  expelled him. Béla III willed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a  |crusade|Crusade|  to the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land| . Instead, Andrew forced his elder brother, King  |Emeric_of_Hungary|Emeric_Of_Hungary| , to cede  |Croatia|Kingdom_Of_Croatia|  and  |Dalmatia|Dalmatia|  as an appanage to him in 1197. The following year, Andrew occupied  |Hum|Zachlumia| .     Despite the fact that Andrew did not stop conspiring against Emeric, the dying king made Andrew guardian of his son,  |Ladislaus_III|Ladislaus_Iii_Of_Hungary| , in 1204. After the premature death of Ladislaus, Andrew ascended the throne in 1205. According to historian László Kontler, was amidst the socio-political turmoil during reign that the relations, arrangements, institutional framework and social categories that arose under Stephen I, started to disintegrate in the higher echelons of society in Hungary. Andrew introduced a new grants policy, the so-called new institutions , giving away money and royal estates to his partisans despite the loss of royal revenues. He was the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title of King of Halych and  |Lodomeria|Prince_Of_Vladimir-In-Volhynia|  . He waged at least a dozen wars to seize the two  |Rus_principalities|Rus_Principalities| , but the local  |boyars|Boyar|  and neighboring princes prevented him from conquering the principalities. He participated in the  |Fifth_Crusade|Fifth_Crusade|  to the Holy Land in 1217–1218, but the crusade was a failure.     When the  servientes regis , or royal servants , rose up, Andrew was forced to issue the  |Golden_Bull_of_1222|Golden_Bull_Of_1222| , confirming their privileges. This led to the rise of the  |nobility_in_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary|Nobility_In_The_Kingdom_Of_Hungary| . His  Diploma Andreanum  of 1224 listed the liberties of the  |Transylvanian_Saxon|Transylvanian_Saxon|  community. The employment of  |Jews|Jews_In_Hungary|  and  |Muslims|Böszörmény|  to administer the royal revenues led him into conflict with the  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  and the Hungarian  |prelates|Prelate| . Andrew pledged to respect the privileges of the clergymen and to dismiss his non-Christian officials in 1233, but he never fulfilled the latter promise.     Andrews first wife,  |Gertrude_of_Merania|Gertrude_Of_Merania| , was murdered in 1213 because her blatant favoritism towards her German kinsmen and courtiers stirred up discontent among the native lords. The veneration of their daughter,  |Elizabeth_of_Hungary|Elizabeth_Of_Hungary| , was confirmed by the Holy See during Andrews lifetime. After Andrews death, his sons,  |Béla|Béla_Iv_Of_Hungary|  and  |Coloman|Coloman_Of_Galicia-Lodomeria| , accused his third wife,  |Beatrice_dEste|Beatrice_Deste,_Queen_Of_Hungary| , of adultery and never considered her son,  |Stephen|Stephen_The_Posthumous| , to be a legitimate son of Andrew.          1177–1197 |02–15|02–15| |05-1235four_[[Argent]]_and_four_[[Gules]]_strip|05-1235Four_[[Argent]]_And_Four_[[Gules]]_Strip| ch. 23. |ngdom_of_Hunga|Ngdom_Of_Hunga| year 1207year 1210now  |Spiš|Spiš| , Slovakia |triarch_of_Aquile|Triarch_Of_Aquile| |ronicl|Ronicl| ch. 9year 1211now  |Sibiu|Sibiu| , Romania |lub|Lub| now Braničevo, Serbianow  |Țara_Bârsei|Țara_Bârsei| , Romania |venue_leasi|Venue_Leasi| now  |Ćuprija|Ćuprija| , Serbia |om_the_[[Illuminated_Chronicle|Om_The_[[Illuminated_Chronicle| in 1201, 1209 and 1213ch. 25.now  |İznik|İZnik| , Turkeythe sons of his uncle, Géza |ngdom_of_Hunga|Ngdom_Of_Hunga| |ngdom_of_Hunga|Ngdom_Of_Hunga| now  |Sibiu|Sibiu| , Romania |llennium_Monume|Llennium_Monume|  b. ±1185b. 1203/1204b. 1206b. 1207, d. 1231 b. ±1210 b. ±1198b. ±1219  |een_Consort_of_Hunga|Een_Consort_Of_Hunga| 23 years old at the time of marriage in 1234 .
