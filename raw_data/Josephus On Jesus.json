These additional manuscript sources of the Testimonium have furnished additional ways to evaluate Josephus mention of Jesus in the Antiquities, principally through a close textual comparison between the Arabic, Syriac and Greek versions to the Testimonium.     There are subtle yet key differences between the Greek manuscripts and these texts. For instance, the Arabic version does not blame the Jews for the death of Jesus. The key phrase at the suggestion of the principal men among us reads instead Pilate condemned him to be crucified . The historical Jesus: ancient evidence for the life of Christ by Gary R. Habermas 1996 ISBN page 194  Instead of he was Christ , the Syriac version has the phrase he was believed to be Christ .

Whealey notes that Michaels Syriac Testimonium shares several peculiar choices of vocabulary with the version found in the Syriac translation of the Church History. These words and phrases are not shared by an independent Syriac translation of the Testimonium from Eusebius book Theophania, strongly indicating that Michaels text is simply a paraphrased quotation from of the Syriac Church History, and not a direct quotation of Josephus himself.     Whealey then argues that Agapius Arabic version of the Testimonium must also be dependent on the same Syriac translation of the Church History. This is largely because Agapius and Michaels Testimonia share the unique peculiarity that they both explicitly state that Jesus died after being condemned to the cross, while the Greek original does not include this detail. According to Whealey, the differences between the two Testimonia are simply due to the fact that Agapius chronicle more freely paraphrases and abbreviates its sources than Michaels in general. The implication of this argument, if valid, is that Agapius abbreviated Testimonium cannot be an earlier version of the passage than what we find in extant manuscripts of Josephus Antiquities. Interestingly, although Whealey intended to show that the Testimonium is almost entirely authentic, her argument has also been embraced by scholars who believe that the Testimonium is a complete forgery, such as ": null

The Testimonium has been the subject of a great deal of research and debate among scholars, being one of the most discussed passages among all antiquities. Louis Feldman has stated that in the period from 1937 to 1980 at least 87 articles had appeared on the topic, the overwhelming majority of which questioned the total or partial authenticity of the Testimonium. Josephus, the Bible, and History by Louis H. Feldman and Gohei Hata 1988  page 430 While early scholars considered the Testimonium to be a total forgery, the majority of modern scholars consider it partially authentic, despite some clear Christian interpolations in the text.  Meier, 1990     The arguments surrounding the authenticity of the Testimonium fall into two categories: internal arguments that rely on textual analysis and compare the passage with the rest of Josephus work; and external arguments, that consider the wider cultural and historical context.  Some of the external arguments are arguments from silence that question the authenticity of the entire passage not for what it says, but due to lack of references to it among other ancient sources.     The external analyses of the Testimonium have even used computer-based methods, e.g. the matching of the text of the Testimonium with the ": null

Goldbergs analyses suggested three possibilities, one that the matches were random, or that the Testimonium was a Christian interpolation based on Luke, and finally that both the Testimonium and Luke were based on the same sources.          One of the key internal arguments against the complete authenticity of the Testimonium is that the clear inclusion of Christian phraseology strongly indicates the presence of some interpolations. For instance, the phrases if it be lawful to call him a man suggests that Jesus was more than human and is likely a Christian interpolation. Some scholars have attempted to reconstruct the original Testimonium, but others contend that attempts to discriminate the passage into Josephan and non-Josephan elements are inherently circular.     Another example of the textual arguments against the Testimonium is that it uses the Greek term poietes to mean doer but elsewhere in his works, Josephus only uses the term poietes to mean poet, whereas this use of poietes seems consistent with the Greek of Eusebius. Josephus and the New Testament by Steve Mason 2003  page 231          According to Wataru Mizugaki, Origen explicitly mentions the name of Josephus 11 times, never mentioning the Testimonium, both in Greek and Latin. Furthermore, Origens statement in his Commentary on Matthew  that Josephus did not accept Jesus as Christ , is usually seen as a confirmation of the generally accepted fact that Josephus did not believe Jesus to be the Messiah. Jesus in his Jewish context by Géza Vermès 2003 pages 91–92 This forms a key external argument against the total authenticity of the Testimonium in that Josephus, as a Jew, would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and the reference to he was the Christ in the Testimonium must be a Christian interpolation. Based on this observation alone, Paul L. Maier calls the case for the total authenticity of the Testimonium hopeless . Almost all modern scholars reject the total authenticity of the Testimonium, while the majority of scholars still hold that it includes an authentic kernel.     A different set of external arguments against the authenticity of the Testimonium are arguments from silence , e.g. that although twelve Christian authors refer to Josephus before Eusebius in 324 AD, none mentions the Testimonium. Echo of a whisper by Clare Rothchild in Ablution, Initiation, and Baptism: Late Antiquity, Early Judaism, and Early Christianity by David Hellholm 2010 page 274 Given earlier debates by Christian authors about the existence of Jesus, e.g. in Justin Martyr s 2nd century ": null

Jewish historiography and iconography in early and Medieval Christianity by Heinz Schreckenberg, Kurt Schubert Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991 page 39     A separate argument from silence against the total or partial authenticity of the Testimonium is that a 5th or 6th century table of contents of Josephus makes no mention of it.     Andreas Köstenberger argues that the fact that the 10th-century Arabic version of the Testimonium lacks distinct Christian terminology while sharing the essential elements of the passage indicates that the Greek Testimonium has been subject to interpolation.

In The Witness To The Historicity of Jesus, Arthur Drews stated that in the sixteenth century Vossius had a manuscript of the text of Josephus in which there was not a word about Jesus. Drews, Arthur page 9       Zvi Baras believes that the Testimonium was subject to interpolation before Eusebius wrote. Baras believes that Origen had seen the original Testimonium but that the Testimonium seen by Origen had no negative reference to Jesus, else Origen would have reacted against it. Baras states that the interpolation in the Testimonium took place between Origen and Eusebius.     Paul Maier states that a comparison of Eusebius reference with the 10th-century Arabic version of the Testimonium due to Agapius of Hierapolis indicates that the Christian interpolation present in the Testimonium must have come early, before Eusebius. Robert E. Van Voorst also states that the interpolation likely took place some time between Origen and Eusebius.       thu       Craig Evans states that an argument in favor of the partial authenticity of the Testimonium is that the passage does not stress the role played by the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus. According to Evans, if the passage had been an interpolation after the emergence of conflicts between Jews and Christians, it would have had a more accusative tone, but in its current form reads as one would expect it to read for a passage composed by Josephus towards the end of the first century. Geza Vermes concurs, arguing that if the Testimonium had been the work of a Christian forger, it would have placed blame on the Jewish leaders, but as is it is perfectly in line with the attitude of Josephus towards Pilate. Vermes also states that the detached depiction of the followers of Jesus is not the work of a Christian interpolator. Vermes calls the Jesus notice in the Testimonium a veritable tour de force in which Josephus plays the role of a neutral witness.     Andreas Köstenberger argues that the Testimonium includes vocabulary that is typically Josephan, and the style is consistent with that of Josephus. Köstenberger state that the Josephus reference to the large number of followers of Jesus during his public ministry is unlikely to have been due to a Christian scribe familiar with the New Testament accounts, and is hence unlikely to be an interpolation.     Claudia Setzer holds that while tribe is an odd way to describe Christians, it does not necessarily have negative connotations. Jewish responses to early Christians by Claudia Setzer 1994 pages 106–107 Setzer argues for the existence of an authentic kernel because the style and vocabulary are Josephan and specific parts are not what one would expect from a Christian forger. Setzer argues that the Testimonium indicates that Josephus had heard of Jesus and the basic elements surrounding his death, and that he saw Jesus as primarily a miracle worker. Van Voorst also states that calling Christians a tribe would have been very out of character for a Christian scribe, while Josephus has used it to refer both to Jewish and Christian groups.
