        In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Eurystheus  was king of  |Tiryns|Tiryns| , one of three  |Mycenaean|Mycenaean_Greece|  strongholds in the  |Argolid|Argolid| , although other authors including  |Homer|Homer|  and  |Euripides|Euripides|  cast him as ruler of  |Argos|Argos| .       Eurystheus was the son of  |Sthenelus|Sthenelus|  and  |Nicippe|Nicippe| , and he was a grandson of the hero  |Perseus|Perseus| , as was his opponent  |Heracles|Heracles| . He was married to  |Antimache|Antimache| , Antimache does not feature further in Greek myth, aside from a list of names of her sons and a genealogy for her, given in Pseudo-Apollodorus,  Bibliotheke  2.5.9, 2.8.1, 3.9.2. daughter of  |Amphidamas|Amphidamas| .     Eurystheus was a cousin of Heracles.              In the contest of wills between  |Hera|Hera|  and  |Zeus|Zeus|  over whose candidate would be  |hero|Greek_Hero| , fated to defeat the remaining creatures representing an old order and bring about the reign of the  |Twelve_Olympians|Twelve_Olympians| , Eurystheus was Heras candidate and Heracles—though his name implies that at one archaic stage of myth-making he had carried Heras fame —was the candidate of Zeus. See Carl A.P. Ruck and Danny Staples, The World of Classical Myth VII. Herakles: Making the New Olympia , pp.163-202. The arena for the actions that would bring about this deep change are the  |Twelve_Labors|Twelve_Labors|  imposed on Heracles by Eurystheus. The immediate necessity for the Labours of Heracles is as penance for Heracles murder of his own family, in a fit of madness, which had been sent by Hera; however, further human rather than mythic motivation is supplied by mythographers who note that their respective families had been rivals for the throne of  |Mycenae|Mycenae| . Details of the individual episodes may be found in the article on the  |Labours_of_Heracles|Labours_Of_Heracles| , but Hera was connected with all of the opponents Heracles had to overcome.  |Walter_Burkert|Walter_Burkert| , Greek Religion p. 210: Heracles seems to carry Heras name in his own, as if Hera were his fame , yet all we ever hear is that from beginning to end,this jealous wife of Zeus persecutes her step-son with unrelenting hatred. For Heras connection with each of Heracles opponents, see under the individual Labours.     Heracles human stepfather  |Amphitryon|Amphitryon|  was also a grandson of Perseus, and since Amphitryons father  was older than Eurystheus father , he might have received the kingdom, but Sthenelus had banished Amphitryon for accidentally killing  the eldest son in the family . When, shortly before his son Heracles was born, Zeus proclaimed the next-born descendant of Perseus should get the kingdom, Hera thwarted his ambitions by delaying  |Alcmenes|Alcmene|  labour and having her candidate Eurystheus born prematurely.Heracles first task was to slay the  |Nemean_Lion|Nemean_Lion|  and bring back its skin, which Heracles decided to wear. Eurystheus was so scared by Heracles fearsome guise that he hid in a subterranean bronze  |winejar|Pithos| , and from that moment forth all labors were communicated to Heracles through a  |herald|Herald| ,  |Copreus|Copreus| .     For his second labour, to slay the  |Lernaean_Hydra|Lernaean_Hydra| , Heracles took with him his nephew,  |Iolaus|Iolaus| , as a charioteer. When Eurystheus found out that Heracles nephew had helped him he declared that the labour had not been completed alone and as a result did not count towards the ten labours set for him.     Eurystheus third task did not involve killing a beast, but capturing one alive—the  |Ceryneian_Hind|Ceryneian_Hind| , a golden-horned  |hind|Deer|  or  |doe|Wikt:Doe|  sacred to  |Artemis|Artemis| . Heracles knew that he had to return the hind, as he had promised, to Artemis, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. Eurystheus did come out, but the moment Heracles let the hind go, she sprinted back to her mistress, and Heracles departed, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.     When Heracles returned with the  |Erymanthian_Boar|Erymanthian_Boar| , Eurystheus was again frightened and hid in his jar, begging Heracles to get rid of the beast; Heracles obliged.     The fifth labour proposed by Eurystheus was to clear out the numerous  |stables_of_Augeias|Augean_Stables| . Striking a deal with Augeias, Heracles proposed a payment of a tenth of Augeias cattle if the labour was completed successfully. Not believing the task feasible, Augeias agreed, asking his son Phyleus to witness.   Heracles rerouted two nearby rivers  through the stable, clearing out the dung rapidly. When Augeias learned of Heracles bargain for the task, he refused payment. Heracles brought the case to court, and Phyleus testified against his father. Enraged, Augeias banished both Phyleus and Heracles from the land before the court had cast their vote. However, Eurystheus refused to credit the labour to Heracles, as he had performed it for payment. So Heracles went and drove Augeias out of the kingdom and installed Phyleus as king. Heracles then took his tenth of the cattle and left them to graze in a field by his home.     For his sixth labour, Heracles had to drive the  |Stymphalian_Birds|Stymphalian_Birds|  off the marshes they plagued. He did so, shooting down several birds with his Hydra-poisoned arrows and bringing them back to Eurystheus as proof.     For his seventh labour, Heracles captured the  |Cretan_Bull|Cretan_Bull| . He used a  |lasso|Lasso|  and rode it back to his cousin. Eurystheus offered to sacrifice the bull to Hera his patron, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the  |Marathonian_Bull|Marathonian_Bull| .     When Heracles brought back the man-eating  |Mares_of_Diomedes|Mares_Of_Diomedes|  successfully, Eurystheus dedicated the horses to Hera and allowed them to roam freely in the Argolid.  |Bucephalus|Bucephalus| ,  |Alexander_the_Greats|Alexander_The_Great|  horse, was said to be descended from these mares.     To acquire the belt of  |Hippolyte|Hippolyte| , queen of the  |Amazons|Amazons|  was Heracles ninth task. This task was at the request of Eurystheus daughter,  |Admete|Admete| . For the tenth labour, he stole the cattle of the  |giant|Giants| |Geryon|Geryon| , which Eurystheus then had sacrificed to Hera.     To extend what may have once been ten Labours to the canonical dozen, it was said that Eurystheus didnt count the Hydra, as he was assisted, nor the Augean stables, as Heracles received payment for his work. For the eleventh labour Heracles had to obtain the Apples of the  |Hesperides|Hesperides| ; he convinced their father, the  |Titan|Titan| |Atlas|Atlas| , to help him, but did his share of work by temporarily holding up the sky in the Titans stead. For his final labour, he was to capture  |Cerberus|Cerberus| , the three-headed hound that guarded the entrance to  |Hades|Greek_Underworld| . When he managed to bring the struggling animal back, the terrified Eurystheus hid in his jar one more time, begging Heracles to leave for good and take the dog with him.       After Heracles died, Eurystheus remained bitter over the indignity the hero had caused him. He attempted to destroy Heracles many children , who fled to  |Athens|Athens| . He attacked the city but was soundly defeated, and Eurystheus and his sons were killed. Though it is widely told that Hyllus killed Eurystheus. The stories about the killer of Eurystheus and the fate of his corpse vary, Pseudo-Apollodorus,  Bibliotheke  3.8.1 and  |Diodorus_Siculus|Diodorus_Siculus|  4.57 give  |Hyllus|Hyllus|  as the slayer,  |Pausanias|Pausanias|  1.44.10 and  |Strabo|Strabo|  7.6.19 give  |Iolaus|Iolaus| . but the Athenians believed the burial site of Eurystheus remained on their soil and served to protect the country against the descendants of Heracles, who traditionally included the  |Sparta|Sparta| ns and  |Argives|Argos| .     After Eurystheus death, the brothers  |Atreus|Atreus|  and  |Thyestes|Thyestes| , whom he had left in charge during his absence, took over the city, the former exiling the latter and assuming the kingship, while  |Tiryns|Tiryns|  returned to the overlordship of  |Argos|Argos| .       Eurystheus was a character in  Heracleidae , a play by  |Euripides|Euripides| .  |Macaria|Macaria| , one of the daughters of  |Heracles|Heracles| , and her brothers and sisters hid from Eurystheus in  |Athens|Athens,_Greece| , ruled by King  |Demophon|Demophon_Of_Athens| . As Eurystheus prepared to attack, an  |oracle|Oracle|  told Demophon that he would win if and only if a  |noble_woman|Nobility|  was sacrificed to  |Persephone|Persephone| . Macaria volunteered for the sacrifice and a spring was named the  |Macarian_spring|Macarian_Spring|  in her honor. Eurystheus speaks prophetically of his burial within Attica, claiming that he will be an anti-hero of sorts, though one who will eventually protect the Athenians. Heracleidae vv. 1026-1044.       Eurystheus appears in the 2014 film  Hercules  portrayed by  |Joseph_Fiennes|Joseph_Fiennes| . Here, Eurystheus is responsible for the death of Hercules family rather than Hercules under  |Heras|Hera|  spell, having drugged Hercules and sent three  |black_wolves|Black_Wolf|  to attack him. The wolves killed Hercules family, though Hercules believed that it was he who killed his own family. Hercules avenges his family by stabbing Eurystheus with his own dagger.         |Kerenyi,_Karl|Karl_Kerenyi| . The Heroes of the Greeks.
