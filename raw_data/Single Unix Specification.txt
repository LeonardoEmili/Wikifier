   The Single UNIX Specification  is the collective name of a family of standards for  |computer|Computer| |operating_systems|Operating_System| , compliance with which is required to qualify for using the  |UNIX|Unix|  trademark. The core specifications of the SUS are developed and maintained by the  |Austin_Group|Austin_Group| , which is a joint working group of  |IEEE|Ieee| , ISO JTC 1 SC22 and  |The_Open_Group|The_Open_Group| . If an operating system is submitted to The Open Group for certification, and passes conformance tests, then it is deemed to be compliant with a UNIX standard such as UNIX  98 or UNIX  03.     Very few  |BSD|Bsd|  and  |Linux|Linux| -based operating systems are submitted for compliance with the Single UNIX Specification, although system developers generally aim for compliance with  |POSIX|Posix|  standards, which form the core of the Single UNIX Specification.           The SUS emerged from a mid-1980s project to standardize  |operating_system|Operating_System| |interfaces|Interface|  for software designed for variants of the Unix operating system. The need for standardization arose because enterprises using computers wanted to be able to develop programs that could be used on the computer systems of different manufacturers without reimplementing the programs. Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface partly because it was manufacturer-neutral.       In 1988, these standards became IEEE 1003 , or  POSIX , which loosely stands for Portable Operating System Interface.       In the early 1990s, a separate effort known as the Common API Specification or Spec 1170 was initiated by several major vendors, who formed the  |COSE|Common_Open_Software_Environment|  alliance in the wake of the  |Unix_wars|Unix_Wars| . This specification became more popular because it was available at no cost, whereas the IEEE charged a substantial fee for access to the POSIX specification. Management over these specifications was assigned to  |X_Open|X_Open|  who also received the  |Unix|Unix|  trademark from  |Novell|Novell|  in 1993.  |Unix_International|Unix_International|  merged into  |Open_Software_Foundation|Open_Software_Foundation|  in 1994 only to merge with X/Open to form  |The_Open_Group|The_Open_Group|  in 1996.       This was a repackaging of the  |X_Open_Portability_Guide|X_Open_Portability_Guide|  , Issue 4, Version 2.       In 1995, the Open Group released the Single UNIX Specification Version 1, 1995 Edition.      This specification consisted of:   System Interface Definitions, Issue 4, Version 2,   System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 4, Version 2,   Commands and Utilities, Issue 4, Version 2,   X/Open Curses, Issue 4 Version 2,   Networking Services, Issue 4,   and was at the core of the UNIX 95 brand.        In 1997, the Open Group released the Single UNIX Specification Version 2.       This specification consisted of:   the Base Definitions, Issue 5,   the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 5,   the Commands and Utilities, Issue 5,   the Networking Services, Issue 5,   the X/Open Curses, Issue 4, Version 2,   and was at the core of the UNIX 98 brand.        Beginning in 1998, a joint  |working_group|Working_Group|  known as the  |Austin_Group|Austin_Group|  began to develop the combined standard that would be known as the Single UNIX Specification Version 3 and as POSIX:2001 . It was released on January 30, 2002.      This standard consisted of:   the Base Definitions, Issue 6,   the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 6,   the Commands and Utilities, Issue 6,   and is at the core of the UNIX 03 brand.        In 2004, a new edition of the POSIX:2001 standard was released, incorporating two technical corrigenda. It is called POSIX:2004 .         In December 2008, the  |Austin_Group|Austin_Group|  published a new major revision, known as POSIX:2008 .    This is the core of the Single UNIX Specification, Version 4 .      This standard consists of:   the Base Definitions, Issue 7,   the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 7,   the Commands and Utilities, Issue 7.       The Technical Corrigendum 1 is mostly targeting internationalization and it introduces a role-based access model. It was published in 2012 for the Unix Base specification and it is registered as the 2013 Edition of POSIX 2008. A trademark UNIX V7  has been created to mark compliance with SUS Version 4.        The Technical Corrigendum 2 has been published in September 2016, leading into IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition and Single UNIX Specification, Version 4, 2016 Edition.       In January 2018 an administrative rollup edition, susv4-2018, was released. It incorporates Single UNIX Specification version 4 TC1 and TC2, and is technically identical to the 2016 edition.        SUSv3 totals some 3700 pages, which are thematically divided into four main parts:     Base Definitions  - a list of definitions and conventions used in the specifications and a list of  |C|C|  header files which must be provided by compliant systems. 84 header files in total are provided.   Shell and Utilities  - a list of utilities and a description of the shell,  |sh|Bourne_Shell| . 160 utilities in total are specified.   System Interfaces  - contains the specification of various functions which are implemented as  |system_calls|System_Call|  or  |library|Library|  functions. 1123 system interfaces in total are specified.   Rationale  - the explanation behind the standard.     The standard user command line and scripting interface is the  |POSIX|Posix|  shell, an extension of the  |Bourne_Shell|Bourne_Shell|  based on an early version of the  |Korn_Shell|Korn_Shell| . Other user-level programs, services and utilities include  |awk|Awk| ,  |echo|Echo| ,  |ed|Ed_Unix| ,  |vi|Vi| , and hundreds of others. Required program-level services include basic  |I_O|Input_Output|   services. A test suite accompanies the standard. It is called PCTS or the POSIX Certification Test Suite.     Additionally, SUS includes  |CURSES|Curses|  specification, which specifies 372 functions and 3 header files. All in all, SUSv3 specifies 1742 interfaces.     Note that a system need not include  |source_code|Source_Code|  derived in any way from AT & T Unix to meet the specification. For instance,  |IBM|Ibm| |_OS_390|Os_390| , now  |z_OS|Z_Os| , qualifies as a Unix despite having no code in common.          There are three official marks for conforming systems   UNIX 98 - the mark for systems conforming to version 2 of the SUS   UNIX 03 - the mark for systems conforming to version 3 of the SUS   UNIX V7 - the mark for systems conforming to version 4 of the SUS      Older UNIX standards   UNIX 93   UNIX 95                     |AIX|Ibm_Aix|  5L V5.2 with some updates, AIX 5L V5.3 and AIX 6.1, are registered as UNIX 03 compliant. AIX 5L V5.2 is registered as UNIX 98 compliant.       EulerOS 2.0 for the  |x86_64|X86_64|  architecture was certified as UNIX  03 compliant.  The UNIX  03 conformance statement shows that the standard C compiler is from the  |GNU_Compiler_Collection|Gnu_Compiler_Collection|  , and that the system is a  |Linux_distribution|Linux_Distribution|  of the  |Red_Hat|Red_Hat|  family.         |HP_UX|Hp_Ux|  11i V3 Release B.11.31 is registered as UNIX 03 compliant. Previous releases are registered as UNIX 95.      HP-UX 11i features also provide partial conformance to the UNIX 98 specification.         |Inspur_K_UX|Inspur_K_Ux|  2.0 and 3.0 for the  |x86_64|X86_64|  architecture were certified as UNIX  03 compliant.   The UNIX  03 conformance statement for Inspur K-UX 2.0 and 3.0 shows that the standard C compiler is from the  |GNU_Compiler_Collection|Gnu_Compiler_Collection|  , and that the system is a  |Linux_distribution|Linux_Distribution|  of the  |Red_Hat|Red_Hat|  family.         |Apples|Apple_Inc_| |_macOS|Macos|  is a UNIX 03 registered product,    first becoming registered with  |Mac_OS_X_10_5|Mac_Os_X_Leopard|  Leopard on October 26, 2007 .   All newer versions of  |macOS|Macos|   have been registered.         |Solaris|Solaris|  11 complies with the Single UNIX Specification.  Solaris 10 is registered as UNIX 03 compliant on  |32_bit|32_Bit|  and  |64_bit|64_Bit| |_x86|X86|   and  |SPARC|Sparc|  systems. Solaris 8 and 9 are registered as UNIX 98 compliant on  |32_bit|32_Bit| |_x86|X86|  and  |SPARC|Sparc|  systems; 64-bit x86 systems are not supported.     Solaris 2.5.1 was also registered as UNIX 95 compliant on the  |PReP|Prep| |_PowerPC|Powerpc|  platform in 1996, but the product was withdrawn before more than a few dozen copies had been sold.         IBM  |z_OS|Z_Os|  1.2 and higher is registered as UNIX 95 compliant.   z/OS 1.9, released on September 28, 2007, and subsequent releases better align with UNIX 03.            The last  |Reliant_UNIX|Reliant_Unix|  versions were registered as UNIX 95 compliant .        |UnixWare|Unixware|  7.1.3 is registered as UNIX 95 compliant.    |SCO_OpenServer|Sco_Openserver|  5 is registered as UNIX 93 compliant.        |Tru64_UNIX|Tru64_Unix|  V5.1A and later are registered as UNIX 98 compliant.       Other operating systems registered as UNIX 95 or UNIX 93 compliant:    |NCR|Ncr_Corporation|  UNIX SVR4    |NEC|Nec|  UX/4800    |SGI|Silicon_Graphics| |_IRIX|Irix|  6.5        Developers and vendors of  |Unix_like|Unix_Like|  operating systems such as  |Linux|Linux| ,  |FreeBSD|Freebsd| , and  |MINIX|Minix| , typically do not certify their distributions and do not install full POSIX utilities by default. For example  |pax|Pax|  and  |sccs|Source_Code_Control_System|  are usually not installed on Linux, as they are not commonly used.  Sometimes, SUS compliance can be improved by installing additional packages, but very few Linux systems can be configured to be completely conformant.      |Darwin|Darwin| , the open source subset of macOS, has behavior that can be set to comply with UNIX  03.       FreeBSD previously had a C99 and POSIX Conformance Project which aimed for compliance with a subset of the Single UNIX Specification, and documentation where there were differences.           For Linux, the  |Linux_Standard_Base|Linux_Standard_Base|  was formed in 2001 as an attempt to standardize the internal structures of Linux-based systems for increased compatibility. It is based on the POSIX specifications, the Single UNIX Specification, and other open standards, and also extends them in several areas; but there are some conflicts between the LSB and The POSIX standards.  However, although these standards are commonly accepted, few  |Linux_distributions|Linux_Distribution|  actually go through certification as LSB compliant.
