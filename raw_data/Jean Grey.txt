Created by writer  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  and artist/co-writer  |Jack_Kirby|Jack_Kirby| , Jean Grey  |first_appeared|First_Appearance|  as Marvel Girl in  The X-Men  1 . The original teams sole female member, Marvel Girl was a regular part of the team through the series publication. Initially possessing the ability of  |telekinesis|Psychokinesis| , the character was later granted the power of  |telepathy|Telepathy| ,  which would be  |retconned|Retroactive_Continuity|  years later as a suppressed mutant ability.      Under the authorship of  |Chris_Claremont|Chris_Claremont|  and the artwork of first  |Dave_Cockrum|Dave_Cockrum|  and then  |John_Byrne|John_Byrne|  in the late 1970s, Jean Grey underwent a significant transformation from the X-Mens weakest member  to its most powerful.     The storyline in which Jean Grey died as Marvel Girl and was reborn as Phoenix  has been retroactively dubbed by fans The Phoenix Saga , and the storyline of her eventual corruption and death as Dark Phoenix  has been termed  |The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga|The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga|  . This storyline is one of the most well-known and heavily referenced in mainstream American  |superhero_comics|Superhero_Comics| , and is widely considered a classic, including Jean Greys suicidal sacrifice.        When the first  |trade_paperback|Trade_Paperback|  of The Dark Phoenix Saga was published in 1984, Marvel also published a 48-page special issue titled Phoenix: The Untold Story. It contained the original version of Uncanny X-Men 137, the original splash page for Uncanny X-Men 138, and transcripts of a  |roundtable_discussion|Round_Table|  between Shooter, Claremont, Byrne, editors  |Jim_Salicrup|Jim_Salicrup|  and  |Louise_Jones|Louise_Simonson| , and inker  |Terry_Austin|Terry_Austin|  about the creation of the new Phoenix persona, the development of the story, and what led to its eventual change, and Claremont and Byrnes plans for Jean Grey had she survived.      Claremont revealed that his and Cockrums motivation for Jean Greys transformation into Phoenix was to create the first female cosmic hero . The two hoped that, like  |Thor|Thor|  had been integrated into  The Avengers  lineup, Phoenix would also become an effective and immensely powerful member of the X-Men. However, both Salicrup and Byrne had strong feelings against how powerful Phoenix had become, feeling that she drew too much focus in the book. Byrne worked with Claremont to effectively remove Phoenix from the storyline, initially by removing her powers. However, Byrnes decision to have Dark Phoenix destroy an inhabited planetary system in Uncanny X-Men 135, coupled with the planned ending to the story arc, worried then-Editor-in-Chief  |Jim_Shooter|Jim_Shooter| , who felt that allowing Jean to live at the conclusion of the story was both morally unacceptable and also an unsatisfying ending from a storytelling point of view. Shooter publicly laid out his reasoning in the 1984 roundtable:     I personally think, and Ive said this many times, that having a character destroy an inhabited world with billions of people, wipe out a starship and then—well, you know, having the powers removed and being let go on Earth. It seems to me that thats the same as capturing  |Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  alive and letting him go live on Long Island. Now, I dont think the story would end there. I think a lot of people would come to his door with machine guns...        One of the creative teams questions that affected the storys conclusion was whether the Phoenixs personality and later descent into madness and evil were inherent to Jean Grey or if the Phoenix was itself an entity merely possessing her. The relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix would continue to be subject to different interpretations and explanations by writers and editors at Marvel Comics following the storys  |retcon|Retcon|  in 1986. At the time of the Dark Phoenixs creation, Byrne felt that, If someone could be seen to corrupt Jean, rather than her just turning bad, this could make for an interesting story.  Salicrup and Byrne stated later that they viewed Phoenix as an entity that entirely possessed Jean Grey, therefore absolving her of its crimes once it was driven out. However, the creative and editorial team ultimately agreed that Phoenix had been depicted as an inherent and inseparable aspect of Jean Grey, meaning that the character was fully responsible for her actions as Phoenix. As a result, Shooter ordered that Claremont and Byrne rewrite issue 137 to explicitly place in the story both a consequence and an ending commensurate with the enormity of Phoenixs actions. In a 2012 public signing, Claremont spoke about the context of the late 1970s and the end of the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  during the storys writing, stating that the history of these events also made Jean Greys genocidal actions difficult to redeem.     In the original ending, Jean does not revert to Dark Phoenix, and the Shiar subject her to a psychic lobotomy , permanently removing all her telepathic or telekinetic powers. Claremont and Byrne planned to later have Magneto offer Jean the chance to restore her abilities, but Jean choosing to remain depowered and eliminate the threat of Dark Phoenix returning to power.        After several years, Marvel decided to revive the character, but only after an editorial decree that the character be absolved of her actions during The Dark Phoenix Saga.  Writer  |Kurt_Busiek|Kurt_Busiek|  is credited with devising the plot to revive Jean Grey. Busiek, a fan of the original five X-Men, was displeased with the characters death and formulated various storylines that would have met Shooters rule and allowed the character to return to the X-Men franchise. He eventually shared his storyline idea with fellow writer  |Roger_Stern|Roger_Stern|  who mentioned it to Byrne, who was both writing and illustrating the Fantastic Four at the time. Both series writer  |Bob_Layton|Bob_Layton|  and artist  |Jackson_Guice|Jackson_Guice| , who were developing the series  X-Factor —a team of former X-Men—had yet to settle on their fifth team member, initially considering  |Dazzler|Dazzler| .  Layton opted to fill the open spot with Jean instead, and both he and Byrne submitted the idea to Shooter, who approved it. Jean Greys revival became a crossover plotline between the Avengers under Stern, Fantastic Four under Byrne, and X-Factor under Layton.     Busiek later found out that his idea had been used thanks to Layton, and he was credited in Fantastic Four 286 and paid for his contributions. The decision to revive Jean Grey was controversial among fans, with some appreciating the return of the character and others feeling it weakened the impact of the Dark Phoenix Sagas ending. Busiek maintained that the idea that led to Jean Greys official return to Marvel Comics was merely a case of sharing his ideas with friends as a fan, and that he neither formally pitched the idea to anyone nor gave it the final go ahead. Claremont expressed dissatisfaction with the retcon, stating in 2012: Wed just gone to all the effort of saying, Jean is dead, get over it, and they said, Haha, we fibbed. So why should anyone trust us again? But thats the difference between being the writer and being the boss. In a 2008 interview Byrne said he still felt Busieks method of reviving Jean Grey was brilliant , but agreed that in retrospect the character should have remained dead.      In the comics, having been fully established as separate from the Jean Grey copy created and taken over by the Phoenix Force, Jean is absolved of involvement in the atrocities of The Dark Phoenix storyline, and she returned in the first issue of X-Factor .      Claremont later commented on how Jeans revival affected his original plans for Madelyne Pryor, stating that the relationship between the two women was intended to be entirely coincidental.  Accessed July 9, 2010. He intended Madelyne only to look like Jean by complete coincidence and exist as a means for Cyclops to move on with his life and be written out of the X-Men franchise, part of what he believed to be a natural progression for any member of the team. Claremont expressed dismay that Jeans resurrection ultimately resulted in Cyclops abandoning his wife and child, tarnishing his written persona as a hero and decent human being , and the untenable situation with Madelyne was dealt with by transforming her into a  |prolicidal|Prolicide|  demonic villain and killing her off.     Soon after the beginning publication of X-Factor, Marvel also reprinted and released the original X-Men series under the title Classic X-Men. These reissues paired the original stories with new vignettes, elaborating on plot points. One such issue, Classic X-Men 8 , paired the original X-Men 100 story of Jean Greys disastrous return flight from space immediately preceding her transformation into Phoenix with the new story Phoenix . The story further supported the retcon establishing Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force as two separate entities.      Following the conclusion of Inferno, Jean continued to be a mainstay character throughout the rest of X-Factor     X-Factor ended its run featuring the original X-Men with X-Factor 70 , with the characters transitioning over to Uncanny X-Men, explained in continuity as the two teams deciding to merge. The fourteen X-Men divide into two teams— Blue and Gold —led by Cyclops and  |Storm|Storm| , respectively. Jean was added to the Gold Team beginning in Uncanny X-Men 281 .    Following Cyclopss possession by the mutant villain  |Apocalypse|Apocalypse|  and disappearance in the conclusion of the crossover storyline Apocalypse: The Twelve ,   Jean lost her telekinetic abilities and was left with increased psychic powers, the result of the six month gap in plot across the X-Men franchise created by the Revolution revamp. During the Revolution event, all X-Men titles began six months after the events of Apocalypse: the Twelve, allowing writers to create fresh situations and stories and gradually fill in the missing events of the previous six months of continuity. Due to editing decisions following the success of the 2000  X-Men  film, which depicted the character of Jean Grey with both telepathy and telekinesis, an explanation for Jeans altered powers in the comics was never explicitly made, though writer Chris Claremont revealed in interviews that it was intended to be an accidental power switch between fellow X-Man  |Psylocke|Psylocke| , explaining Psylockes new telekinetic powers as well.     Jean was next featured in the six-issue miniseries  X-Men Forever  written by  |Fabian_Nicieza|Fabian_Nicieza| , which was designed to tie up remaining plot lines. During the series, Jean revisited many of the events involving the Phoenix Force and the series introduced the concept of Omega level mutants , a category for mutants with unlimited potential, which included Jean herself.    In June 2001, X-Men was retitled as New X-Men under writer  |Grant_Morrison|Grant_Morrison| . The title consisted of a smaller team featuring Jean, Cyclops, Beast, Wolverine,  |Emma_Frost|Emma_Frost| , and Charles Xavier. The overarching plot focused on the team assuming the roles of teachers to a new generation of mutants at the Xavier Institute while navigating their personal relationships and dealing with newly emerging pro- and anti-mutant political sentiments.  Jean also made minor appearances in other titles during the New X-Men run, such as Chris Claremonts X-Treme X-Men, occasionally lending support to the characters.      Jean and her connection with the Phoenix Force was examined again one year after the conclusion of Morrisons run on New X-Men in  X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong  written by  |Greg_Pak|Greg_Pak|  in 2005.  At the 2010  |San_Diego_Comic-Con|San_Diego_Comic-Con|  X-Men panel, when asked whether or not Jean would return, editor Nick Lowe responded by saying, Shes dead.      Regarding Jeans actual return to the X-Men franchise, Marvel indicated that Jeans eventual return is being discussed but stated that the return of Jean Grey was a story Marvel does not want to rush .  Marvel loosely tied questions regarding Jean Greys eventual return to the events in 2007s  X-Men: Messiah Complex  in which a mutant girl named  |Hope|Hope_Summers| —who has red hair, green eyes, and immense mutant powers—is born,  and 2010s  X-Men: Second Coming  which sees both Hopes return as a teenager and the return of the Phoenix Force.     Following the conclusion of  Avengers vs. X-Men  as part of the  |Marvel_NOW!|Marvel_Now!|  event, a teenage Jean Grey and the four other founding members of X-Men are transported across time to the present day by  |Beast|Beast|  in the series  All-New X-Men  by  |Brian_Michael_Bendis|Brian_Michael_Bendis| .       The original adult Jean Grey returned to the Marvel Universe in a new series titled Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey, released on December 27, 2017. The series was written by  |Matthew_Rosenberg|Matthew_Rosenberg|  with art by  |Leinil_Francis_Yu|Leinil_Francis_Yu| .      Following the events of Extermination story, the time-displaced Jean Grey and the other original X-Men were returned to their original time, as part of  |Jonathan_Hickmans|Jonathan_Hickman|  plan to reboot the entire X-Men franchise.            Jean Elaine Grey was born the second daughter of  |John|Dr._John_Grey|  and  |Elaine_Grey|Elaine_Grey| . She had an older sister,  |Sara_Grey-Bailey|Sara_Grey-Bailey| . John Grey was a professor at  |Bard_College|Bard_College|  in  |upstate_New_York|Upstate_New_York| . Depictions of Jeans childhood and her relations with her family have shown a stable, loving family life growing up.       Jeans mutant powers of telepathy and telekinesis first manifest when her best friend is hit by a car and killed. Jean mentally links with her friend and nearly dies as well. The event leaves her comatose, and she is brought back to consciousness when her parents seek the help of powerful mutant telepath, Charles Xavier.  Xavier blocks her telepathy until she is old enough to be able to control it, leaving her with access only to her telekinetic powers.  Xavier later recruits her as a teenager to be part of his X-Men team as Marvel Girl , the teams sole female member.  After several missions with the X-Men, Xavier removes Jeans mental blocks and she is able to use and control her telepathic powers. She begins a relationship with teammate  |Cyclops|Cyclops| , which persists as her main romantic relationship, though she also develops a mutual secret attraction to a later addition to the team, Wolverine.              During an emergency mission in space, the X-Men find their shuttle damaged. Jean pilots the shuttle back to Earth, but is exposed to fatal levels of radiation. Dying, but determined to save Cyclops and her friends, Jean calls out for help and is answered by the cosmic entity, the Phoenix Force.  The Phoenix Force, the sum of all life in the universe,  is moved by Jeans dedication and love and takes the form of a duplicate body to house Jeans psyche. In that instant, the Phoenix Force is overwhelmed and believes itself to be Jean Grey and places Jeans dying body in a healing cocoon. This cocoon is later described as a Phoenix Egg. The ship crashes in Jamaica Bay, with the other X-Men unharmed.    The Phoenix Force, as Jean Grey, emerges in a new green and gold costume and adopts the new codename Phoenix , with immense cosmic powers.  Meanwhile, the cocoon containing the real Jean Grey sinks to the bottom of the bay, unnoticed. Phoenix continues her life as Jean Grey with the other X-Men, joining them on missions and saving the universe. During  |The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga|The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga|  , Phoenix becomes overwhelmed and corrupted by her first taste of evil and transforms into a force of total destruction, called Dark Phoenix , inadvertently killing the inhabitants of a planetary system, after consuming its star, and jeopardizing the entire universe.  However, Jeans personality manages to take control and Phoenix commits suicide to ensure the universes safety.          Upon its suicide by way of a disintegration ray, the Phoenix Force disperses into its original form and a fragment locates the still-healing Jean at the bottom of Jamaica Bay.  In trying to bond with her, Jean senses its memories of death and destruction as Dark Phoenix and rejects it, causing it to bond with and animate a lifeless clone of Jean Grey created by the villain Mister Sinister. Sinister created the clone to mate with Cyclops to create genetically superior mutants. Named  |Madelyne_Pryor|Madelyne_Pryor|  , the unaware clone meets Cyclops in a situation engineered by Sinister and the two fall in love, marry, and have a child, Nathan Christopher Summers. Meanwhile, the cocoon is discovered and retrieved by the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. Jean emerges with no memory of the actions of the Phoenix/Dark Phoenix. The Avengers and Fantastic Four tell her of what happened and that she was believed dead until now. She is reunited with the original X-Men and convinces them to form the new superhero team X-Factor, reusing her Marvel Girl codename. Jean learns that Cyclops has romantically moved on with Madelyne, who is angered over his decision to lead X-Factor and neglect his family. Though Jean encourages Cyclops to return to Madelyne, he finds their house abandoned and assumes that Madelyne has left him and taken their infant son;  Cyclops returns to X-Factor and he and Jean continue their relationship.  The teams adventures continued throughout the series, culminating in the line-wide  |Inferno|Inferno|  crossover. Madelyne eventually resurfaces, now nearly insane and with powers awakened by a demonic pact, calling herself the Goblyn Queen.      Learning of her true identity and purpose as a clone created by  |Mister_Sinister|Mister_Sinister|  drove her completely insane and she plans to sacrifice Nathan Christopher to achieve greater power and unleash literal Hell on Earth. While attempting to stop her, Jean is reunited with the other X-Men, who are happy to learn that she is alive, particularly Wolverine, reminding Jean of her unaddressed feelings for him. Jean and Madelyne confront each other, and Madelyne attempts to kill them both. Jean manages to survive only by absorbing the remnant of the Phoenix Force housed within Madelyne, giving her both Madelynes memories and the Phoenixs memories from The Dark Phoenix Saga .        While continuing on X-Factor, Cyclops proposes to Jean and she meets her alternate future daughter Rachel Summers , but she rejects them both out of the feeling that they indicate that her life is predetermined. When X-Factor unites with the X-Men, Jean joins the Gold Team, led by Storm. During this time, she no longer uses a codename, instead being referred to by her civilian name. After some time, she makes up with Rachel, welcoming her into her life, and proposes to Cyclops and the two marry.  On their honeymoon, the couple is immediately psychically transported 2000 years into the future to raise Cyclopss son Nathan, who had been transported to the future as an infant in hopes of curing him of a deadly virus. Jean adopts the identity of Redd along with Cyclops and they raise Nathan Christopher for twelve years before they are sent back into their bodies on their wedding honeymoon. Jean learns that a time-displaced Rachel had used her powers to transport them to the future to protect Nathan, and per Rachels request, Jean adopts the codename Phoenix once again to establish it as a symbol of good after all the bad it had caused.  Meanwhile, her psychic and telekinetic abilities begin to grow and she begins using the iconic green and gold Phoenix costume again.  Jean also met another alternate future child of hers and Scotts: the immensely powerful  |Nathan_Grey|Nate_Grey| , who accidentally revived the psionic ghost of Madelyne Pryor, leading to another confrontation between the two women.           In  |Bishops|Bishop|  original timeline before he ends up in the present he finds the X-Mens  |war_room|War_Room|  and finds a garbled distress signal from Jean about a traitor destroying the X-Men from within. Uncanny X-Men 287 Meanwhile, in the present, the X-Men begin to hear increasing news about a malevolent entity called  |Onslaught|Onslaught| . Jean first sees Onslaught as a psionic image with the rest of the X-Men after Onslaught coerces  |Gateway|Gateway|  to kidnap Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, and Iceman. X-Men 50 He later appears to her again in a similar way after rescuing her and  |Gambit|Gambit|  from  |Bastion|Bastion|  and offers her a chance to join him. Uncanny X-Men 333 Onslaught makes his first full appearance to Jean on the astral plane and shows her how humanity is closing in on mutants as well as revealing that Xavier was in love with her while she was a student to convince her to join him. He then telepathically brands his name to her mind when she refused and asks him his name. X-Men 53 When Juggernaut comes to the mansion with information about Onslaughts true identity but has a mental block preventing him from divulging it, Jean enters his mind and helps him to remember who Onslaught really is and to her horror she discovers that Onslaught is really Professor X, having gone insane ever since wiping Magnetos mind. X-Men 54       Professor Xavier calls the X-Men together for a meeting and Jean tries unsuccessfully to rally the X-Men against him before he manifests Onslaught. While Onslaught easily overtakes the rest of the X-Men, Jean escapes to the war room and sends out the distress signal that Bishop found in the future. After a massive battle against Jean and the rest of the X-Men, Onslaught escapes to carry out his plans. After Onslaught nearly kills the X-Men they team up with the Avengers to make a plan to stop him, knowing full well that it may come down to them killing Xavier if the world is to survive. Jean accompanies Cyclops, Archangel, and  |Psylocke|Psylocke|  to Muir Island where they and  |Moira_McTaggart|Moira_Mctaggart|  discover the Xavier Protocols, secret plans that Xavier made to kill any of the individual X-Men should anyone become a threat against the world.

In a final act of desperation Jean finds  |Hulk|Bruce_Banner|  and locks away Bruce Banners mind, leaving only the Hulk in control so he can fight Onslaught unencumbered. With the vast majority of earths heroes missing and assumed dead after Onslaught is finally defeated, Jean and Cyclops open their home to  |Quicksilver|Quicksilver|  and his daughter and try to help the X-Men to get their lives back together.

These therapy sessions lead to a psychic affair between Scott and Emma. Jeans discovery of the psychic affair results in a confrontation between her and Emma, though ultimately Jean realizes that Emma truly loves him.

The time travel also caused her suppressed telepathic powers to awaken much earlier in her life than they were supposed to. All-New X-Men 3 She also has a habit of reading peoples minds without their permission, to the great frustration of her team. During the  Battle of the Atom  crossover, a future version of this Jean Grey, who had never returned to the past and whose powers had grown beyond her control, would return to the present as  |Xorn|Xorn| , a member of the future  |Brotherhood_of_Mutants|Brotherhood_Of_Mutants| . All-New X-Men 16 Xorn perished during the battle, but in the process the X-Men also found out that there is something preventing the All-New X-Men from returning to the past. Wolverine and the X-Men 37 During this timeline, she reads the mind of current Beast, who regrets never admitting his feelings for her, so confronts younger Beast and gives him a kiss, which creates problems with the younger Cyclops. All-New X-Men 15 She and her team also leave the  |Jean_Grey_School_for_mutants|X-Mansionpost_X-Men:_Schism|  and go to  |Cyclopss_school|Uncanny_X-Men2013–2015:_Volume_3| , where she forms a reluctant friendship with Emma Frost as she trains her psychic abilities. All-New X-Men 30       Jean is later kidnapped by the Shiar and placed on trial for the destruction done by the Phoenix Force years earlier in a 2014 crossover story line The Trial of Jean Grey. The All-New X-Men team up with the  |Guardians_of_the_Galaxy|Guardians_Of_The_Galaxy|  to rescue Jean from the Shiar homeworld, but Jean would end up awakening a new power that she never had, in which she is able to absorb massive amounts of psionic energy from others and combine her telepathy and telekinesis, which she used to defeat the powerful Gladiator, leader of the Shiar. Guardians of the Galaxy 13       While searching for new mutants, Jean and the All-New X-Men get teleported into the  |Ultimate_Marvel|Ultimate_Marvel|  universe. She teams up with  |Spider-Man|Spider-Man|  to rescue Beast, whos been trapped by the local  |Dr._Doom|Alternative_Versions_Of_Doctor_Doomultimate_Marvel| . Before she is teleported back she gives Miles Morales a kiss. Upon their return to Earth 616, she and the All-New X-Men team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy a second time in search of  |The_Black_Vortex|The_Black_Vortex| .       Following the reconstruction of reality after the  |Battleworld_crisis|Secret_Wars| , Jean has parted ways from the rest of the time-displaced X-Men as she attempts to find her own life in the present by living a normal civilian life in College until  |Storm|Storm|  recruits her to join her  |new_team_of_X-Men_to_help_protect_mutants_from|Extraordinary_X-Men| |Terrigen|Terrigen| . Extraordinary X-Men 1 She mentions having broken up with Hank McCoy, considering him to be more of a brother. Extraordinary X-Men 2 After the X-Men  |go_to_war_against_the_Inhumans_to_destroy_the_Terrigen|Inhumans_Vs._X-Men| , Jean leaves Storms team and attempts to return to her original timeline along with the rest of the time-displaced X-Men but realizes that theyre not from the 616 timeline, leaving them stranded on Earth 616 with no idea which timeline theyre originally from. All-New X-Men 19 With this new knowledge that they are from an unknown alternate timeline, Jean becomes the time-displaced X-Mens new leader and they quit the X-Men in hopes of finding their place in the current world. X-Men: Prime 1       Jean ends up approached by Magneto, who offers her and her team to join him in preserving Xaviers dream by defeating those who oppose it. X-Men: Blue 1 Jean accepts and her team joins him, but in secret they train themselves in case Magneto ever reverts to his villainous roots to kill them. X-Men: Blue 2          As part of the Marvels  RessurXion  event, Jean Grey received her first-ever solo series. While on a solo mission against the  |Wrecking_Crew|Wrecking_Crew| , Jean receives a vision that the Phoenix Force is coming back to earth. Jean Grey 1 She goes to the rest of the X-Men to warn them about her vision but as there havent been any Phoenix sightings since  |the_X-Men_went_to_war_against_the_Avengers_to_decide_the_fate_of_the_Phoenix|Avengers_Vs._X-Men| , she has a hard time getting  |Beast|Beast| ,  |Captain_Marvel|Carol_Danvers| , and  |Kitty_Pryde|Kitty_Pryde|  to accept that her vision was real even though they assure her that if the Phoenix ever does return then the X-Men and Avengers will come together and do all they can to stop it. Jean feels even less taken seriously when Beast begins examining her for signs of delusional hallucinations. Jean then meets with other former Phoenix hosts  |Colossus|Colossus| ,  |Magik|Magik| ,  |Rachel_Summers|Rachel_Summers| ,  |Hope_Summers|Hope_Summers|  and  |Quentin_Quire|Quentin_Quire| , where the latter uses his powers to show her how the aftereffects of bonding with the Phoenix Force has individually affected each of them. Jean Grey 2 A meeting with  |Namor|Namor|  helps Jean come to the conclusion that she can refuse the Phoenix and even possibly defeat it. Jean Grey 3 After meeting with  |Thor|Thor|  and training with  |Psylocke|Psylocke| , Jean learns how to create telekinetic weapons to help with her impending battle against the Phoenix. Jean Grey 4-5         Jean ends up sent back in time for unknown reasons and ends up meeting that timelines Jean Grey shortly after she first becomes Phoenix. Time-displaced Jean attempts to ask Phoenix questions about the Phoenix Force but she dodges Jeans questions. Instead Phoenix takes Jean for a night out and shows off her powers. After witnessing Phoenix use her cosmic powers to fight off  |Galactus|Galactus|  from consuming a defenseless planet, Jean contemplates warning Phoenix of her fate until an encounter with  |The_Watcher|The_Watcher|  stops her from doing so. The Watcher commends Jean and tells her that choosing to not change her future means that her ultimate fate is in her own hands whether or not she ends up hosting the Phoenix Force back in her present. As Jean returns to her present, Phoenix cryptically states that they will meet again. Generations: Phoenix and Jean Grey 1       Backed by a host of former Phoenix Force wielders, Emma Frost, Quentin Quire, Hope Summers, the Stepford Cuckoos and even the spirit of the adult Jean Grey, the teen Jean tries to defy destiny and stop the Phoenix before it can take her over and bend her to its will. With the Phoenix Force now on Earth, the team realizes its going to take a lot more than they have to stop it. And while the young Jean is able to wound the Phoenix with the aid of Cables Psi-mitar, the Phoenix seems just too strong for anyone to overcome. Teen Jean eventually managed to push the cosmic force far away from her friends and allies, where a final battle can take place. However, both Jean Greys learned how wrong they were, as the Phoenix was never coming for teen Jean, at least not like they believed. Actually, the Phoenix wants the adult Jean, but to do that it needs the young Jean out of the way. Thus, the force floods her body with flaming psychic energy, incinerating her from the inside out, leaving only a skeleton. Jean Grey 10 This was done to resurrect the adult Jean Grey, which the Phoenix considers its one true host. However, after dying, the younger Jean found herself somehow in the White Hot Room despite not being a Phoenix host. Angry, the Phoenix attempted to destroy her using mental manifestations of its past hosts, created from pieces of their life forces left in the Room. Jean realized that she could control the White Hot Room against the Phoenix wishes and commanded the cosmic entity to resurrect her, which it did so in order to get rid of her. After returning to Madripoor, she was approached by her resurrected older Earth-616 counterpart, much to her surprise. Jean Grey 11       Adult Jean went back to using the Marvel Girl codename and wore her second green-and-yellow Marvel Girl costume. She was part of a strike team sent to outer space to stop a satellite near the sun from being used as a Sentinel factory. Sentinels crushed Jeans escape pod and she died, only for Jeans mind to be transferred into a cloned body created by Professor X. House of X 5 She is also a member of quiet council of Summer season. House of X 6       Jean Grey is an  |Omega-level_mutant|Omega-Level_Mutant| , and at her highest and strongest potential was fully merged with the  |Phoenix_Force|Phoenix_Force|  and with it was able to defeat even  |Galactus|Galactus| .        Jean is a powerful empath, as she can feel and manipulate emotions of other people, as shown when she felt her friend, Annie Richardson, as she was slowly dying when her power first emerged. Jean can also connect peoples minds to the feelings of others and make them feel the pain they inflicted  .       When her powers first manifested, Jean was unable to cope with her  |telepathic_abilities|Telepathy| , forcing  |Professor_Charles_Xavier|Professor_X|  to suppress her access to it altogether. Instead, he chose to train her in the use of her  |psychokinetic_abilities|Psychokinesis|  while allowing her telepathy to grow at its natural rate before reintroducing it.  When the Professor hid to prepare for the  |ZNox|List_Of_Alien_Races_In_Marvel_Comicsz| , he reopened Jeans telepathic abilities, which was initially explained by writers as Xavier sharing some of his telepathy with her.         Jean is also one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals . As a side effect of her telepathy, she has an  |eidetic_memory|Eidetic_Memory| .  Jean was able, through telepathic therapy with the comatose Jessica Jones, to grant Jessica immunity to the Purple Mans mind control abilities, despite his powers being chemical in nature rather than psychic.  When Jean absorbed  |Psylockes|Psylocke|  specialized telepathic powers, her own telepathy was increased to the point that she could physically manifest her telepathy as a psionic  |firebird|Phoenix|  whose claws could inflict both physical and mental damage. She briefly developed a psychic shadow form like Psylockes, with a gold Phoenix emblem over her eye instead of the  |Crimson_Dawn|Crimson_Dawn|  mark possessed by Psylocke. Jean briefly lost her telekinesis to Psylocke during this exchange, but her telekinetic abilities later came back in full and at a far stronger level than before. It was later stated that Jean has been an Omega Level telepath.  .       Jean possesses a high-level of telekinetic ability that enables her to psionically levitate and rapidly move about all manner of animate and inanimate matter. She can use her telekinetic abilities on herself or others to simulate the power of flight or levitation, stimulate molecules to increase friction, create protective force fields out of psychokinetic energy, or project her telekinetic energy as purely concussive force. The outer limits of her telekinetic power have never been clearly established, though she was capable of lifting approximately fifty tons of rubble with some strain. New X-Men 116       Jeans younger self who had been brought from the past into the present by an older Hank McCoy eventually found an entirely new usage of her powers separate from the Phoenix Force. The teenage Marvel Girl learned she has the ability to harness ambient psychic energy and channel it into powerful blasts of force, which are a combination of both her telepathy and telekinesis.  Its potency is such that she can match and overpower the likes of Gladiator, magistrate of the Shiar, with relative ease. When using this ability Jeans whole body glows with pink psychic energy, obscuring her human form.       Under the tutelage of  |Psylocke|Psylocke| , teenage Marvel Girl has learned the ability to create psionic weapons that damage a target either physically, mentally or both in some point. She showed skill in constructing multiple types of psionic weapons that differ in size, length and power which she uses in combat. Jean Grey 5          The relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force is portrayed in a variety of ways throughout the characters history. In the initial plotline of the Phoenix being a manifestation of Jeans true potential, these powers are considered her own, as part of Claremont and Byrnes desire to create the first cosmic superheroine . However, since the retcon of the Phoenix as a separate entity from Jean Grey, depictions of these powers vary; these include Jean being one of many hosts to the Phoenix and borrowing its Phoenix powers during this time,  being a unique host to the Phoenix, and being one with the Phoenix. She is later described as the only one currently to be able to hold the title of White Phoenix of the Crown among the many past, present, and future hosts of the Phoenix. Jean — both young and adult versions — is also the only character ever to force the Phoenix against its own cosmic will to do anything while not presently a host to its powers. In one instance Jean forcibly ripped the Phoenix out of Emma Frost and imposed its status upon herself.  X-Men: Phoenix - End song  5 Young Jean was able to keep her psyche anchored in the Phoenixs mind postmortem despite the Phoenixs own efforts to forcibly remove her after it murdered her. Jean then subsequently forced the Phoenix to resurrect her after manipulating the Phoenixs mental landscape against it. Jean Grey 11          The Phoenix Force also seems to render its host unaging and, at least in some adaptations, enhances the physical strength of its avatar to superhuman levels; in certain incarnations, Jean, namely while acting as Dark Phoenix, seemed to possess some level of superhuman strength.       For one reason or another, Jean Grey has, on more than one occasion, been repeatedly resurrected by either the Phoenix  X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong  1 or apparently her sheer force of will without Phoenix.  X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong  5 Venomized 5 In some depictions, these resurrections are immediately after she or whoever she is reviving is killed, while other depictions indicate that a resurrection must occur at a correct time, sometimes taking a century. During the height of the  |Psych_Wars|Jean_Greypsych_War| , Young Jean was able to forcibly make the Phoenix Force restore her to life, despite the Phoenixs adamant resolve not to do so, completely recreating her body after it had been vaporized. Some time later, after her body was taken over and completely devoured by a  |Poison|Symbiote_Weaknesses| , a small part of Jeans mind survived and, despite itself, was able to infect the whole Poison Hive and destroy it from the inside out, subsequently using nothing but her mind to reconstruct her body. This leaves Jean believing that she may not even be human anymore. Venomized 1-5 This is not the first time Jean was resurrected without the Phoenix; in one instance, she was even able to fully resurrect herself after being clinically dead completely independent of the Phoenix Force.       Jean Grey is a trained pilot and proficient unarmed combatant. She also has some degree of teaching ability, experience as a fashion model, and training in psychology.
