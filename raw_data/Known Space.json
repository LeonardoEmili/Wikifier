The colony expanded greatly during the first Man-Kzin war 2367-2433.   The  Sol Belt  possesses an abundance of valuable ores, which are easily accessible due to the low to negligible gravity of the rocks containing them. Originally a harsh frontier under U.N. control, the Belt declared independence after creating Confinement Asteroid, a habitat with spin gravity that permitted safe gestation of children, and Farmers Asteroid, the Belts primary food source. Almost immediately a lively competition began between the fiercely independent Belters and the technology police of the U.N. Several years of tension and economic conflicts followed, but soon settled into a relatively peaceful trade relationship as the Belt has so many resources that the UN and the Earth need.    Mercury  is also a colony world with a small number of inhabitants, used mainly for mining and as a gravitational anchor for orbiting solar power stations which beam power to the more remote colonies using gigantic lasers. At the time of the First Man-Kzin War, human society is so pacifistic that no weapons exist; those who are able to even contemplate killing another sentient being or constructing a weapon for that purpose are regarded as mental aberrations and must take drugs to control their thoughts. However, an enormous laser, whether constructed as a weapon or not, makes a highly effective one, and its strongly implied that the existence of the Mercury power satellites is a large part of what enabled Sol System to hold off the Kzinti in the early part of the war.

Standard hyperdrive covers a distance of one light-year every three days . A more advanced Quantum II Hyperdrive introduced later is able to cover the same distance in one and a quarter minutes .     In Nivens first novel,  World of Ptavvs , the hyperdrive used by the Thrintun required a ship to be going faster than 93% of the speed of light. However, this is the only time that Hyperdrive is described this way.     In the vast majority of Known Space material, hyperdrive requires that a ship be outside a stars gravity well to use. Ships which activate hyperdrive close to a star are likely to disappear without a trace. This effect is regarded as a limitation based on the laws of physics. In Nivens novel  Ringworlds Children  the Ringworld itself is converted into a gigantic Quantum II hyperdrive and launched into hyperspace while within its stars gravity well.  Ringworlds Children  reveals that there is life in hyperspace around gravity wells and that hyperspace predators eat spaceships which appear in hyperspace close to large masses, thus explaining why a structure as large as the Ringworld can safely engage the hyperdrive in a stars gravity well.     One phenomenon travellers in hyperspace can experience is the so-called blind spot should they look through a porthole or camera screen, giving the impression that the walls around the porthole or sides of the camera view screen are expanding to cover up the outside. The phenomenon is the result of hyperspace being so fundamentally different from normal/Einstein space that a travellers senses can not truly comprehend it, and instead the observer sees a form of nothingness that can be hypnotic and dangerous.   Staring too long into the blind spot can be insanity inducing, so as a precaution all view ports on ships are blinded when a ship enters hyperspace.       The ": null

Niven demonstrated this, to his own satisfaction, with Safe at Any Speed . He used the setting for much less short fiction after 1968 and much less for novels after two published in 1980. Late in that decade, Niven invited other authors to participate in a series of shared-universe novels, with the Man-Kzin Wars as their setting. The first volume was published in 1988.          Ringworld won the annual Nebula, Hugo, and Locus best novel awards.   Protector and The Ringworld Engineers were nominated for the Hugo and Locus Awards.                 Niven has described his fiction as playground equipment , encouraging fans to speculate and extrapolate on the events described. Debates have been made, for example, on who built the Ringworld , and what happened to the Tnuctipun. Niven also states that this is not an invitation to violate his copyrights, warning potential publishers and editors not to proceed without permission.     Niven was also reported to have said that Known Space should be seen as a possible future history told by people that may or may not have all their facts right.     The author also published an outline for a story which would destroy the Known Space Series , in an article entitled Although the article is written as though Niven intended to write the story, he later wrote that the article was only an elaborate joke, and he never intended to write such a novel.
