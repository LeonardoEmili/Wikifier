   In  |differential_geometry|Differential_Geometry| , a subject of  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a symplectic manifold is a  |smooth_manifold|Differentiable_Manifolddefinition| , M , equipped with a  |closed|Closed_And_Exact_Differential_Forms| |_nondegenerate|Nondegenerate_Form|  differential  |2_form|Differential_Form|    , called the  |symplectic_form|Symplectic_Form| . The study of symplectic manifolds is called  |symplectic_geometry|Symplectic_Geometry|  or  |symplectic_topology|Symplectic_Topology| . Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of  |classical_mechanics|Classical_Mechanics|  and  |analytical_mechanics|Analytical_Mechanics|  as the  |cotangent_bundles|Cotangent_Bundle|  of manifolds. For example, in the  |Hamiltonian_formulation|Hamiltonian_Mechanics|  of classical mechanics, which provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifolds  |cotangent_bundle|Cotangent_Bundle|  describes the  |phase_space|Phase_Space|  of the system.         Symplectic manifolds arise from  |classical_mechanics|Classical_Mechanics| ; in particular, they are a generalization of the  |phase_space|Phase_Space|  of a closed system.  In the same way the  |Hamilton_equations|Hamilton_Equations|  allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of  |differential_equations|Differential_Equation| , the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a  |vector_field|Vector_Field|  describing the flow of the system from the differential dH of a Hamiltonian function H.  So we require a linear map , or equivalently, an element of . Letting ω denote a  |section|Section|  of , the requirement that ω be  |non_degenerate|Degenerate_Form|  ensures that for every differential dH there is a unique corresponding vector field V H  such that . Since one desires the Hamiltonian to be constant along flow lines, one should have , which implies that ω is  |alternating|Alternating_Form|  and hence a 2-form. Finally, one makes the requirement that ω should not change under flow lines, i.e. that the  |Lie_derivative|Lie_Derivative|  of ω along V H  vanishes. Applying  |Cartans_formula|Cartan_Homotopy_Formula| , this amounts to ω should be  |closed|Closed_And_Exact_Differential_Forms| .         A symplectic form on a smooth  |manifold|Manifold|  M is a closed non-degenerate differential  |2_form|Two_Form|    .     Here, non-degenerate means that for every point p   M , the skew-symmetric pairing on the  |tangent_space|Tangent_Space|  Tp M defined by   is non-degenerate. That is to say, if there exists an X   Tp M such that   0 for all Y   Tp M , then X 0 . Since in odd dimensions,  |skew_symmetric_matrices|Skew_Symmetric_Matrices|  are always singular, the requirement that   be nondegenerate implies that M has an even dimension. The closed condition means that the  |exterior_derivative|Exterior_Derivative|  of   vanishes. A symplectic manifold is a pair where M is a smooth manifold and   is a symplectic form. Assigning a symplectic form to M is referred to as giving M a symplectic structure.         There is a standard linear model, namely a  |symplectic_vector_space|Symplectic_Vector_Space|    Let   be a basis for   We define our symplectic form ω on this basis as follows:     :     1 & j-i n   1   i   n   -1 & i-j n   1   j   n   0 &         In this case the symplectic form reduces to a simple  |quadratic_form|Quadratic_Form| . If I n  denotes the n × n  |identity_matrix|Identity_Matrix|  then the matrix, Ω, of this quadratic form is given by the   |block_matrix|Block_Matrix| |submanifold|Submanifold|  of a symplectic manifold .     symplectic submanifolds of M are submanifolds S   M such that   is a symplectic form on S .     isotropic submanifolds are submanifolds where the symplectic form restricts to zero, i.e. each tangent space is an isotropic subspace of the ambient manifolds tangent space. Similarly, if each tangent subspace to a submanifold is co-isotropic , the submanifold is called co-isotropic.     Lagrangian submanifolds of a sympletic manifold are submanifolds where the restriction of the symplectic form   to L  M is vanishing, i.e.   and   M . Langrangian submanifolds are the maximal isotropic submanifolds.     The most important case of the isotropic submanifolds is that of Lagrangian submanifolds. A Lagrangian submanifold is, by definition, an isotropic submanifold of maximal dimension, namely half the dimension of the ambient symplectic manifold. One major example is that the graph of a  |symplectomorphism|Symplectomorphism|  in the product symplectic manifold  is Lagrangian. Their intersections display rigidity properties not possessed by smooth manifolds; the  |Arnold_conjecture|Arnold_Conjecture|  gives the sum of the submanifolds  |Betti_numbers|Betti_Number|  as a lower bound for the number of self intersections of a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, rather than the  |Euler_characteristic|Euler_Characteristic|  in the smooth case.       Let   have global coordinates labelled . Then, we can equip   with the canonical symplectic form     :       +   +         There is a standard Lagrangian submanifold given by       . The form   vanishes on   because given any pair of tangent vectors X fi   Ygi  we have that   0. To elucidate, consider the case n1 . Then, X f  Yg  and       Notice that when we expand this out     :           both terms we have a   factor, which is 0, by definition.     The cotangent bundle of a manifold is locally modeled on a space similar to the first example. It can be shown that we can glue these affine symplectic forms hence this bundle forms a symplectic manifold. A more non-trivial example of a Lagrangian submanifold is the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold. For example, let     : X       Then, we can present TX as     : TX       where we are treating the symbols   as coordinates of   T  We can consider the subset where the coordinates   and   , giving us the zero section. This example can be repeated for any manifold defined by the vanishing locus of smooth functions f1,  and their differentials   .     Another useful class of Lagrangian submanifolds can be found using Morse theory. Given a Morse function f:M  and for a small enough   one can construct a Lagrangian submanifold given by the vanishing locus     TM . For a generic morse function we have a Lagrangian intersection given by M       .            In the case of  |Kahler_manifolds|Kahler_Manifold|   we can make a choice   on M as a holomorphic n-form, where   is the real part and   imaginary. A Lagrangian submanifold L is called special if in addition to the above Lagrangian condition the restriction   to L is vanishing. In other words, the real part   restricted on L leads the volume form on L . The following examples are known as special Lagrangian submanifolds,   : complex Lagrangian submanifolds of  |hyperKahler_manifolds|Hyperkahler_Manifold| ,   : fixed points of a real structure of Calabi-Yau manifolds.   The  |SYZ_conjecture|Syz_Conjecture|  has been proved for special Lagrangian submanifolds but in general, it is open, and brings a lot of impacts to the study of  |mirror_symmetry|Mirror_Symmetry| . see          A Lagrangian fibration of a symplectic manifold M is a  |fibration|Fibration|  where all of the  |fibres|Fiber_Bundleformal_Definition|  are Lagrangian submanifolds. Since M is even-dimensional we can take local coordinates  and by  |Darbouxs_theorem|Darbouxs_Theorem|  the symplectic form ω can be, at least locally, written as , where d denotes the  |exterior_derivative|Exterior_Derivative|  and ∧ denotes the  |exterior_product|Exterior_Product| . Using this set-up we can locally think of M as being the  |cotangent_bundle|Cotangent_Bundle|  T  and the Lagrangian fibration as the trivial fibration   T      This is the canonical picture.          Let L be a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold  given by an  |immersion|Immersion|   . Let  give a Lagrangian fibration of K. The composite  is a Lagrangian mapping. The  |critical_value_set|Critical_Value|  of π ∘ i is called a  |caustic|Caustic| .     Two Lagrangian maps  and  are called Lagrangian equivalent if there exist  |diffeomorphisms|Diffeomorphism|  σ, τ and ν such that both sides of the diagram given on the right  |commute|Commutative_Diagram| , and τ preserves the symplectic form. Symbolically:   :     i1 i2                           ,   where τ ∗ ω 2 denotes the  |pull_back|Pullback_Pullback_Of_Differential_Forms|  of ω 2 by τ.         A symplectic manifold endowed with a  |metric|Metric_Tensor|  that is  |compatible|Almost_Complex_Manifoldcompatible_Triples|  with the symplectic form is an  |almost_Kähler_manifold|Almost_Kähler_Manifold|  in the sense that the tangent bundle has an  |almost_complex_structure|Almost_Complex_Structure| , but this need not be  |integrable|Integrability_Condition| .     Symplectic manifolds are special cases of a  |Poisson_manifold|Poisson_Manifold| . The definition of a symplectic manifold requires that the symplectic form be non-degenerate everywhere, but if this condition is violated, the manifold may still be a Poisson manifold.     A multisymplectic manifold of degree k is a manifold equipped with a closed nondegenerate k-form.      A polysymplectic manifold is a Legendre bundle provided with a polysymplectic tangent-valued -form; it is utilized in Hamiltonian field theory.
