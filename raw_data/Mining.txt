               Mining is the extraction of valuable  |minerals|Mineral|  or other geological materials from the Earth, usually from an  |ore|Ore|  body,  |lode|Lode| ,  |vein|Vein| ,  |seam|Coal_Mining| ,  |reef|Quartz_Reef_Mining|  or  |placer_deposit|Placer_Deposit| . These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.     Ores recovered by mining include  |metals|Metalextraction| ,  |coal|Coal_Mining| ,  |oil_shale|Oil_Shale| ,  |gemstones|Gemstone| ,  |limestone|Limestone| ,  |chalk|Chalk_Mining| ,  |dimension_stone|Dimension_Stone| ,  |rock_salt|Sodium_Chloride| ,  |potash|Potash| ,  |gravel|Gravel| , and  |clay|Clay| . Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created  |artificially|Chemical_Synthesis|  in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any  |non_renewable_resource|Non_Renewable_Resource|  such as petroleum, natural gas, or even  |water|Fossil_Water| .     Mining of stones and metal has been a human activity since  |pre_historic|Prehistory|  times. Modern mining processes involve  |prospecting|Prospecting|  for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final  |reclamation|Mine_Reclamation|  of the land after the mine is closed.      Mining operations usually create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. Hence, most of the worlds nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact.  |Work_safety|Mine_Safety|  has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines.     Levels of metal  |recycling|Recycling|  are generally low. Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products. Due to the low recycling rates, some  |landfills|Landfill|  now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.                 Since the beginning of civilization, people have used  |stone|Rock| ,  |ceramics|Ceramic|  and, later,  |metals|Metal|  found close to the  |Earths|Earth|  surface. These were used to make early  |tools|Tool|  and  |weapons|Weapon| ; for example, high quality  |flint|Flint|  found in northern  |France|France| , southern  |England|England|  and Poland was used to create  |flint_tools|Flint| . Hartman, Howard L. SME Mining Engineering Handbook, Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration Inc, 1992, p. 3. Flint mines have been found in  |chalk|Chalk|  areas where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries. The mines at  |Grimes_Graves|Grimes_Graves|  and  |Krzemionki|Krzemionki|  are especially famous, and like most other flint mines, are  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  in origin .

The  |gold_mines_of_Nubia|Nubiakerma|  were among the largest and most extensive of any in Ancient Egypt. These mines are described by the Greek author  |Diodorus_Siculus|Diodorus_Siculus| , who mentions  |fire_setting|Fire_Setting|  as one method used to break down the hard rock holding the gold. One of the complexes is shown in one of the earliest known maps. The miners crushed the ore and ground it to a fine powder before washing the powder for the gold dust.             Mining in Europe has a very long history. Examples include the silver mines of  |Laurium|Laurium| , which helped support the Greek  |city_state|City_State|  of  |Athens|Athens| . Although they had over 20,000 slaves working them, their technology was essentially identical to their Bronze Age predecessors.  At other mines, such as on the island of  |Thassos|Thasos| , marble was quarried by the  |Parians|Paros|  after they arrived in the 7th century BC.  The marble was shipped away and was later found by archaeologists to have been used in buildings including the tomb of Amphipolis.  |Philip_II_of_Macedon|Philip_Ii_Of_Macedon| , the father of Alexander the Great, captured the gold mines of Mount Pangeo in 357 BC to fund his military campaigns.  He also captured gold mines in  |Thrace|Eastern_Macedonia_And_Thrace|  for minting coinage, eventually producing 26 tons per year.     However, it was the  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  who developed large scale mining methods, especially the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous  |aqueducts|Aqueduct| . The water was used for a variety of purposes, including removing overburden and rock debris, called  |hydraulic_mining|Hydraulic_Mining| , as well as washing  |comminuted|Comminution| , or crushed, ores and driving simple machinery.     The Romans used hydraulic mining methods on a large scale to prospect for the  |veins|Vein|  of ore, especially a now-obsolete form of mining known as  |hushing|Hushing| . They built numerous  |aqueducts|Aqueduct|  to supply water to the minehead. There, the water stored in large  |reservoirs|Reservoirs|  and tanks. When a full tank was opened, the flood of water  |sluice|Sluice| d away the  |overburden|Overburden|  to expose the  |bedrock|Bedrock|  underneath and any gold veins. The rock was then worked upon by  |fire_setting|Fire_Setting|  to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The resulting  |thermal_shock|Thermal_Shock|  cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks. The Roman miners used similar methods to work  |cassiterite|Cassiterite|  deposits in  |Cornwall|Cornwall|  and  |lead|Lead|  ore in the  |Pennines|Pennines| .     The methods had been developed by the Romans in  |Spain|Spain|  in 25 AD to exploit large  |alluvial|Alluvial|  gold deposits, the largest site being at  |Las_Medulas|Las_Medulas| , where seven long aqueducts tapped local rivers and sluiced the deposits. The Romans also exploited the silver present in the  |argentiferous_galena|Galena|  in the mines of  |Cartagena|Cartagena_Spain|  ,  |Linares|Linares_Jaén|  ,  |Plasenzuela|Plasenzuela|  and  |Azuaga|Azuaga| , among many others.   |Spain|Spain|  was one of the most important mining regions, but all regions of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  were exploited. In Great Britain the natives had mined minerals for  |millennia|Millennia| ,  but after the  |Roman_conquest|Roman_Conquest_Of_Britain| , the scale of the operations increased dramatically, as the Romans needed  |Britannias|Britannia|  resources, especially  |gold|Gold| ,  |silver|Silver| ,  |tin|Tin| , and  |lead|Lead| .     Roman techniques were not limited to surface mining. They followed the ore veins underground once opencast mining was no longer feasible. At  |Dolaucothi|Dolaucothi|  they  |stoped|Stoping|  out the veins and drove  |adits|Adit|  through bare rock to drain the stopes. The same adits were also used to ventilate the workings, especially important when  |fire_setting|Fire_Setting|  was used. At other parts of the site, they penetrated the  |water_table|Water_Table|  and dewatered the mines using several kinds of machines, especially  |reverse_overshot_water_wheels|Reverse_Overshot_Water_Wheel| . These were used extensively in the  |copper|Copper|  mines at  |Rio_Tinto|Rio_Tinto|  in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, and lifting water about . They were worked as treadmills with miners standing on the top slats. Many examples of such devices have been found in old Roman mines and some examples are now preserved in the  |British_Museum|British_Museum|  and the  |National_Museum_of_Wales|National_Museum_Of_Wales| .                  Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in  |medieval_Europe|Middle_Ages| . The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron. Other  |precious_metals|Precious_Metal|  were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through  |open_pit_mining|Open_Pit_Mining| , and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts. Around the 14th century, the growing use of weapons, armour,  |stirrups|Stirrup| , and horseshoes greatly increased the demand for iron. Medieval knights, for example, were often laden with up to  of plate or  |chain_link_armour|Chain_Mail|  in addition to swords, lances and other weapons. A culture of Improvement. Robert Friedel. MIT Press. 2007. p. 81 The overwhelming dependency on iron for military purposes spurred iron production and extraction processes.     The silver crisis of 1465 occurred when all mines had reached depths at which the shafts could no longer be pumped dry with the available technology.  Although an increased use of  |banknotes|Banknote| , credit and copper coins during this period did decrease the value of, and dependence on, precious metals,  |gold|Gold|  and silver still remained vital to the story of medieval mining.     Due to differences in the social structure of society, the increasing extraction of mineral deposits spread from central Europe to England in the mid-sixteenth century. On the continent, mineral deposits belonged to the crown, and this regalian right was stoutly maintained. But in England, royal mining rights were restricted to gold and silver by a judicial decision of 1568 and a law in 1688. England had iron, zinc, copper, lead, and tin ores. Landlords who owned the base metals and coal under their estates then had a strong inducement to extract these metals or to lease the deposits and collect royalties from mine operators. English, German, and Dutch capital combined to finance extraction and refining. Hundreds of German technicians and skilled workers were brought over; in 1642 a colony of 4,000 foreigners was mining and smelting copper at  |Keswick|Keswick_Cumbria|  in the northwestern mountains. Heaton Herbert Economic History of Europe. A Harper International Edition. Fifth printing. February 1968. p. 316     Use of water power in the form of  |water_mills|Water_Mill|  was extensive. The water mills were employed in crushing ore, raising ore from shafts, and ventilating galleries by powering giant  |bellows|Bellows| .  |Black_powder|Gun_Powder|  was first used in mining in  |Selmecbánya|Banská_Štiavnica| ,  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary|   in 1627.  Black powder allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins. Blasting was much faster than  |fire_setting|Fire_Setting|  and allowed the mining of previously impenetrable metals and ores. The use of Firesetting in the Granite Quarries of South India Paul T.

The widespread adoption of agricultural innovations such as the iron  |plowshare|Plowshare| , as well as the growing use of metal as a building material, was also a driving force in the tremendous growth of the iron industry during this period. Inventions like the  |arrastra|Arrastra|  were often used by the Spanish to pulverize ore after being mined. This device was powered by animals and used the same principles used for grain  |threshing|Threshing| . The Spanish Tradition in Gold and Silver Mining. Otis E. Young  Arizona and the West , Vol. 7, No. 4 , pp. 299–314  .     Much of the knowledge of medieval mining techniques comes from books such as  |Biringuccio|Biringuccio| ’s  De la pirotechnia  and probably most importantly from  |Georg_Agricolas|Georg_Agricola|   De re metallica  . These books detail many different mining methods used in German and Saxon mines. A prime issue in medieval mines, which  |Agricola|Georgius_Agricola|  explains in detail, was the removal of water from mining shafts. As miners dug deeper to access new veins, flooding became a very real obstacle. The mining industry became dramatically more efficient and prosperous with the invention of mechanical and animal driven pumps.             Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC. The early Filipinos worked various mines of gold, silver, copper and iron. Jewels, gold ingots, chains, calombigas and earrings were handed down from antiquity and inherited from their ancestors. Gold dagger handles, gold dishes, tooth plating, and huge gold ornaments were also used. . Accessed January 7, 2013.. In Laszlo Legezas Tantric elements in pre-Hispanic Philippines Gold Art , he mentioned that gold jewelry of Philippine origin was found in  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| . According to  |Antonio_Pigafetta|Antonio_Pigafetta| , the people of  |Mindoro|Mindoro|  possessed great skill in mixing gold with other metals and gave it a natural and perfect appearance that could deceive even the best of silversmiths. The natives were also known for the pieces of jewelry made of other precious stones such as carnelian, agate and pearl. Some outstanding examples of Philippine jewelry included necklaces, belts, armlets and rings placed around the waist.

Western cities such as  |Denver|Denver_Colorado|  and  |Sacramento|Sacramento_California|  originated as mining towns.     When new areas were explored, it was usually the gold and then silver that were taken into possession and extracted first. Other metals would often wait for railroads or canals, as coarse gold dust and nuggets do not require smelting and are easy to identify and transport.          In the early 20th century, the gold and silver rush to the western United States also stimulated mining for coal as well as  |base_metals|Base_Metal|  such as copper, lead, and iron. Areas in modern Montana, Utah, Arizona, and later Alaska became predominate suppliers of copper to the world, which was increasingly demanding copper for electrical and households goods. Miller C. .

Canadas mining industry grew more slowly than did the United States due to limitations in transportation, capital, and U.S. competition; Ontario was the major producer of the early 20th century with nickel, copper, and gold.     Meanwhile, Australia experienced the  |Australian_gold_rushes|Australian_Gold_Rushes|  and by the 1850s was producing 40% of the worlds gold, followed by the establishment of large mines such as the  |Mount_Morgan_Mine|Mount_Morgan_Mine| , which ran for nearly a hundred years,  |Broken_Hill_ore_deposit|Broken_Hill_Ore_Deposit|  , and the iron ore mines at  |Iron_Knob|Iron_Knob| . After declines in production, another boom in mining occurred in the 1960s. Now, in the early 21st century, Australia remains a major world mineral producer. . Australian Atlas of Minerals Processing, Mines, and & Processing Centres.     As the 21st century begins, a globalized  |mining_industry|Mining_Industry|  of large multinational corporations has arisen.  |Peak_minerals|Peak_Minerals|  and  |environmental_impacts|Environmental_Effects|  have also become a concern. Different elements, particularly  |rare_earth_minerals|Rare_Earth_Mineral| , have begun to increase in demand as a result of new technologies.             The process of mining from discovery of an ore body through extraction of minerals and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the ore body, which is carried out through  |prospecting|Prospecting|  or  |exploration|Mineral_Exploration|  to find and then define the extent, location and value of the ore body. This leads to a mathematical  |resource_estimation|Mineral_Resource_Classification|  to estimate the size and  |grade|Ore_Grade|  of the deposit.     This estimation is used to conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore deposit. This identifies, early on, whether further investment in estimation and engineering studies is warranted and identifies key risks and areas for further work. The next step is to conduct a  |feasibility_study|Mining_Feasibility_Study|  to evaluate the financial viability, the technical and financial risks, and the robustness of the project.     This is when the mining company makes the decision whether to develop the mine or to walk away from the project. This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, the  |metallurgy|Metallurgy|  and ore recoverability, marketability and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the  |enrichment_factor|Enrichment_Factor|  of the ore in the area.     To gain access to the mineral deposit within an area it is often necessary to mine through or remove  |waste_material|Gangue|  which is not of immediate interest to the miner. The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process. Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine, depending on the nature and location of the ore body. Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator, so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms an essential part of the geological exploration program for a mining operation.     Once the analysis determines a given ore body is worth recovering, development begins to create access to the ore body. The mine buildings and processing plants are built, and any necessary equipment is obtained. The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so. Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered,  |reclamation|Land_Rehabilitation|  begins to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use.          Mining techniques can be divided into two common  |excavation|Earthworks|  types:  |surface_mining|Surface_Mining|  and  |sub_surface_mining|Underground_Mining| . Today, surface mining is much more common, and produces, for example, 85% of minerals in the United States, including 98% of metallic ores. Hartmann HL. Introductory Mining Engineering, p. 11. .     Targets are divided into two general categories of materials: placer deposits, consisting of valuable minerals contained within river gravels, beach sands, and other  |unconsolidated_materials|Alluvium| ; and lode deposits, where valuable minerals are found in veins, in layers, or in mineral grains generally distributed throughout a mass of actual rock. Both types of ore deposit, placer or lode, are mined by both surface and underground methods.     Some mining, including much of the rare earth elements and  |uranium_mining|Uranium_Mining| , is done by less-common methods, such as  |in_situ_leach|In_Situ_Leach| ing: this technique involves digging neither at the surface nor underground. The extraction of target minerals by this technique requires that they be soluble, e.g.,  |potash|Potash| ,  |potassium_chloride|Potassium_Chloride| ,  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride| ,  |sodium_sulfate|Sodium_Sulfate| , which dissolve in water. Some minerals, such as copper minerals and  |uranium_oxide|Uranium_Oxide| , require acid or carbonate solutions to dissolve.             |Surface_mining|Surface_Mining|  is done by removing surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include:  |open_pit_mining|Open_Pit_Mining| , which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground,  |quarry|Quarry| ing, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay;   |strip_mining|Strip_Mining| , which consists of stripping surface layers off to reveal ore/seams underneath; and  |mountaintop_removal|Mountaintop_Removal_Mining| , commonly associated with coal mining, which involves taking the top of a mountain off to reach ore deposits at depth. Most placer deposits, because of their shallowly buried nature, are mined by surface methods. Finally,  |landfill_mining|Landfill_Mining|  involves sites where  |landfills|Landfill|  are excavated and processed.  Landfill Mining, Preserving Resources through Integrated Sustainable Management of Waste, Technical Brief from the World Resource Foundation Landfill mining has been thought of as a solution to dealing with long-term methane emissions and local pollution             High wall mining is another form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In high wall mining, the coal seam is penetrated by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Push-beam Transfer Mechanism . A typical cycle includes sumping and shearing . As the coal recovery cycle continues, the cutter-head is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet . Then, the Push-beam Transfer Mechanism automatically inserts a 19.72-foot long rectangular Push-beam into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutter-head. The Push-beam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet into the coal seam. One patented high wall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Push-beam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor , the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miners progress. High wall mining can produce thousands of tons of coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas venting system.             Sub-surface mining consists of digging tunnels or shafts into the earth to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified by the type of access shafts used, the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit.  |Drift_mining|Drift_Mining|  utilizes horizontal access tunnels,  |slope_mining|Slope_Mining|  uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and  |shaft_mining|Shaft_Mining|  utilizes vertical access shafts. Mining in  |hard|Underground_Mining|  and  |soft|Underground_Mining|  rock formations require different techniques.     Other methods include  |shrinkage_stope_mining|Shrinkage_Stope_Mining| , which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room,  |long_wall_mining|Long_Wall_Mining| , which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and  |room_and_pillar|Room_And_Pillar|  mining, which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room. Room and pillar mining often leads to  |retreat_mining|Retreat_Mining| , in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat, allowing the room to cave in, thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include  |hard_rock_mining|Underground_Mining| , which is mining of hard rock materials, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope mining, sub level caving, and  |block_caving|Block_Caving| .              |Heavy_machinery|Heavy_Machinery|  is used in mining to explore and develop sites, to remove and stockpile overburden, to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness, to process the ore, and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed. Bulldozers, drills, explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land. In the case of  |placer_mining|Placer_Mining| , unconsolidated gravel, or  |alluvium|Alluvium| , is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or  |trommel|Trommel|  which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel. The minerals are then concentrated using  |sluices|Sluices|  or jigs.     Large  |drills|Diamond_Drilling|  are used to sink shafts, excavate stopes, and obtain samples for analysis.  |Trams|Tram|  are used to transport miners, minerals and waste. Lifts carry miners into and out of mines, and move rock and ore out, and machinery in and out, of underground mines. Huge trucks, shovels and cranes are employed in surface mining to move large quantities of overburden and ore. Processing plants utilize large crushers, mills, reactors, roasters and other equipment to consolidate the mineral-rich material and extract the desired compounds and metals from the ore.          Once the mineral is extracted, it is often then processed. The science of  |extractive_metallurgy|Extractive_Metallurgy|  is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the extraction of valuable metals from their ores, especially through chemical or mechanical means.      |Mineral_processing|Mineral_Processing|  is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation of valuable metals or minerals from their  |gangue|Gangue|  . Processing of placer ore material consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as  |sluice|Sluice|  boxes. Only minor shaking or washing may be necessary to disaggregate the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, whether it is a surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.     Since most metals are present in ores as oxides or sulfides, the metal needs to be  |reduced|Redox|  to its metallic form. This can be accomplished through chemical means such as  |smelting|Smelting|  or through electrolytic reduction, as in the case of  |aluminium|Aluminium| .  |Geometallurgy|Geometallurgy|  combines the geologic sciences with extractive metallurgy and mining.     In 2018, led by Chemistry and Biochemistry professor Bradley D. Smith,  |University_of_Notre_Dame|University_Of_Notre_Dame|  researchers invented a new class of molecules whose shape and size enable them to capture and contain precious metal ions, reported in a study published by the  |Journal_of_the_American_Chemical_Society|Journal_Of_The_American_Chemical_Society| . The new method converts gold-containing ore into  |chloroauric_acid|Chloroauric_Acid|  and extracts it using an industrial solvent. The container molecules are able to selectively separate the gold from the solvent without the use of water stripping. The newly developed molecules can eliminate water stripping, whereas mining traditionally relies on a 125-year-old method that treats gold-containing ore with large quantities of poisonous  |sodium_cyanide|Sodium_Cyanide| ... this new process has a milder environmental impact and that, besides gold, it can be used for capturing other metals such as platinum and palladium, and could also be used in urban mining processes that remove precious metals from wastewater streams.

In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to create space for the storage of the created debris and soil.  Contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals can also affect the health of the local population if not properly controlled.  Extreme examples of pollution from mining activities include  |coal_fires|Coal_Seam_Fire| , which can last for years or even decades, producing massive amounts of environmental damage.     Mining companies in most countries are required to follow stringent environmental and rehabilitation codes in order to minimize environmental impact and avoid impacting human health. These codes and regulations all require the common steps of  |environmental_impact_assessment|Environmental_Impact_Assessment| , development of  |environmental_management|Environmental_Management|  plans,  |mine_closure_planning|Mine_Closure_Planning|  , and  |environmental_monitoring|Environmental_Monitoring|  during operation and after closure. However, in some areas, particularly in the developing world, government regulations may not be well enforced.     For major mining companies and any company seeking international financing, there are a number of other mechanisms to enforce environmental standards. These generally relate to financing standards such as the  |Equator_Principles|Equator_Principles| ,  |IFC|International_Finance_Corporation|  environmental standards, and criteria for  |Socially_responsible_investing|Socially_Responsible_Investing| . Mining companies have used this oversight from the financial sector to argue for some level of  |industry_self_regulation|Industry_Self_Regulation| . Moody R. . Rocks and Hard Places. Zed Books. In 1992, a Draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations was proposed at the  |Rio_Earth_Summit|Earth_Summit|  by the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations , but the Business Council for Sustainable Development together with the International Chamber of Commerce argued successfully for self-regulation instead. Abrahams D. . , p. 6. UNRISD.     This was followed by the Global Mining Initiative which was begun by nine of the largest metals and mining companies and which led to the formation of the  |International_Council_on_Mining_and_Metals|International_Council_On_Mining_And_Metals| , whose purpose was to act as a catalyst in an effort to improve social and environmental performance in the mining and metals industry internationally. The mining industry has provided funding to various conservation groups, some of which have been working with conservation agendas that are at odds with an emerging acceptance of the rights of indigenous people – particularly the right to make land-use decisions.      Certification of  |mines_with_good_practices|Mineral_Industry_Of_Peru|  occurs through the  |International_Organization_for_Standardization|International_Organization_For_Standardization|  . For example,  |ISO_9000|Iso_9000|  and  |ISO_14001|Iso_14001| , which certify an auditable environmental management system , involve short inspections, although they have been accused of lacking rigor.  Certification is also available through  |Ceres|Ceres| |_Global_Reporting_Initiative|Global_Reporting_Initiative| , but these reports are voluntary and unverified. Miscellaneous other certification programs exist for various projects, typically through nonprofit groups.      The purpose of a 2012 EPS PEAKS paper Bloom, M.J. & Denison, M. Environmental management for extractives, PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE SERVICES  was to provide evidence on policies managing  |ecological_costs|Environmental_Economics|  and maximise  |socio_economic|Socioeconomics|  benefits of mining using host country regulatory initiatives. It found existing literature suggesting donors encourage developing countries to:   Make the environment-poverty link and introduce cutting-edge wealth measures and  |natural_capital|Natural_Capital|  accounts.   Reform old taxes in line with more recent financial innovation, engage directly with the companies, enacting land use and impact assessments, and incorporate specialised support and standards agencies.   Set in play transparency and community participation initiatives using the wealth accrued.       Ore mills generate large amounts of waste, called  |tailings|Tailings| . For example, 99 tons of waste are generated per ton of copper, with even higher ratios in  |gold_mining|Gold_Mining|  – because only 5.3 g of gold is extracted per ton of ore, a ton of gold produces 200,000 tons of tailings.  These tailings can be toxic. Tailings, which are usually produced as a  |slurry|Slurry| , are most commonly dumped into ponds made from naturally existing valleys. US EPA. . . These ponds are secured by impoundments . In 2000 it was estimated that 3,500 tailings impoundments existed, and that every year, 2 to 5 major failures and 35 minor failures occurred; for example, in the  |Marcopper_mining_disaster|Marcopper_Mining_Disaster|  at least 2 million tons of tailings were released into a local river.

In central Finland, Talvivaara Terrafame polymetal mine waste effluent since 2008 and numerous leaks of saline mine water has resulted in ecological collapse of nearby lake.  Subaqueous tailings disposal is another option. The mining industry has argued that submarine tailings disposal , which disposes of tailings in the sea, is ideal because it avoids the risks of tailings ponds; although the practice is illegal in the United States and Canada, it is used in the developing world. Coumans C. .  . MiningWatch Canada.     The waste is classified as either sterile or mineralised, with acid generating potential, and the movement and storage of this material forms a major part of the mine planning process. When the mineralised package is determined by an economic cut-off, the near-grade mineralised waste is usually dumped separately with view to later treatment should market conditions change and it becomes economically viable. Civil engineering design parameters are used in the design of the waste dumps, and special conditions apply to high-rainfall areas and to seismically active areas. Waste dump designs must meet all regulatory requirements of the country in whose jurisdiction the mine is located. It is also common practice to rehabilitate dumps to an internationally acceptable standard, which in some cases means that higher standards than the local regulatory standard are applied.       Many mining sites are remote and not connected to the grid. Electricity is typically generated with  |diesel_generators|Diesel_Generator| . Due to high transportation cost and theft during transportation the cost for generating electricity is normally high. Renewable energy applications are becoming an alternative or amendment. Both  |solar|Solar_Power|  and  |wind_power|Wind_Power|  plants can contribute in saving diesel costs at mining sites. Renewable energy applications have been built at mining sites.    Cost savings can reach up to 70%.           Mining exists in many countries.

The US mining industry is also large, but it is dominated by the coal and other nonmetal minerals , and various regulations have worked to reduce the significance of mining in the United States. In 2007 the total  |market_capitalization|Market_Capitalization|  of mining companies was reported at US$962  billion, which compares to a total global market cap of publicly traded companies of about US$50  trillion in 2007.

While exploration and mining can be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small businesses, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, companies, most of them publicly listed. It can be argued that what is referred to as the mining industry is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources and the other in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies, called juniors , which are dependent on venture capital. The mining sector is made up of large multinational companies that are sustained by production from their mining operations. Various other industries such as equipment manufacture, environmental testing, and metallurgy analysis rely on, and support, the mining industry throughout the world. Canadian stock exchanges have a particular focus on mining companies, particularly junior exploration companies through Torontos TSX Venture Exchange ; Canadian companies raise capital on these exchanges and then invest the money in exploration globally. Some have argued that below juniors there exists a substantial sector of illegitimate companies primarily focused on manipulating stock prices.     Mining operations can be grouped into five major categories in terms of their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities. Of all of these categories, oil and gas extraction remains one of the largest in terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a vital area of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining ; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003–2006 to the period 2006–2009 , largely due to artisanal mining. Swenson JJ, Carter CE, Domec J-C, Delgado CI PLoS ONE 6: e18875. . Lay summary: .       Mining companies can be classified based on their size and financial capabilities:   Major companies are considered to have an adjusted annual mining-related revenue of more than US$500 million, with the financial capability to develop a major mine on its own.   Intermediate companies have at least $50 million in annual revenue but less than $500 million.   Junior companies rely on equity financing as their principal means of funding exploration. Juniors are mainly pure exploration companies, but may also produce minimally, and do not have a revenue exceeding US$50  million.       New regulations and a process of legislative reforms aim to improve the harmonization and stability of the mining sector in mineral-rich countries.     New legislation for mining industry in African countries still appears to be an issue, but has the potential to be solved, when a consensus is reached on the best approach.     By the beginning of the 21st century the booming and increasingly complex mining sector in mineral-rich countries was providing only slight benefits to local communities, especially in given the sustainability issues. Increasing debate and influence by NGOs and local communities called for a new approaches which would also include disadvantaged communities, and work towards sustainable development even after mine closure . By the early 2000s, community development issues and resettlements became mainstream concerns in World Bank mining projects. Mining-industry expansion after mineral prices increased in 2003 and also potential fiscal revenues in those countries created an omission in the other economic sectors in terms of finances and development. Furthermore, this highlighted regional and local demand for mining revenues and an inability of sub-national governments to effectively use the revenues. The Fraser Institute has highlighted the environmental protection laws in developing countries, as well as voluntary efforts by mining companies to improve their environmental impact. . MiningFacts.org. Fraser Institute .     In 2007 the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative was mainstreamed in all countries cooperating with the World Bank in mining industry reform. The EITI operates and was implemented with the support of the EITI multi-donor trust fund, managed by the World Bank. The EITI aims to increase transparency in transactions between governments and companies in extractive industries   by monitoring the revenues and benefits between industries and recipient governments. The entrance process is voluntary for each country and is monitored by multiple stakeholders including governments, private companies and civil society representatives, responsible for disclosure and dissemination of the reconciliation report; however, the competitive disadvantage of company-by company public report is for some of the businesses in Ghana at least, the main constraint. Therefore, the outcome assessment in terms of failure or success of the new EITI regulation does not only rest on the governments shoulders but also on civil society and companies.     On the other hand, implementation has issues; inclusion or exclusion of artisanal mining and small-scale mining from the EITI and how to deal with non-cash payments made by companies to subnational governments. Furthermore, the disproportionate revenues the mining industry can bring to the comparatively small number of people that it employs, causes other problems, like a lack of investment in other less lucrative sectors, leading to swings in government revenuebecause of volatility in the oil markets. Artisanal mining is clearly an issue in EITI Countries such as the Central African Republic, D.R. Congo, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – i.e. almost half of the mining countries implementing the EITI. Among other things, limited scope of the EITI involving disparity in terms of knowledge of the industry and negotiation skills, thus far flexibility of the policy , creates another risk of unsuccessful implementation. Public awareness increase, where government should act as a bridge between public and initiative for a successful outcome of the policy is an important element to be considered.       The World Bank has been involved in mining since 1955, mainly through grants from its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , with the Banks Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency offering political risk insurance. For an overview of the Bank and mining, see . Between 1955 and 1990 it provided about $2  billion to fifty mining projects, broadly categorized as reform and rehabilitation, greenfield mine construction, mineral processing, technical assistance, and engineering. These projects have been criticized, particularly the Ferro Carajas project of Brazil, begun in 1981. See the 1995 World Development 23 pp. 385–400. The World Bank established mining codes intended to increase foreign investment; in 1988 it solicited feedback from 45 mining companies on how to increase their involvement.     In 1992 the World Bank began to push for privatization of government-owned mining companies with a new set of codes, beginning with its report The Strategy for African Mining. In 1997, Latin Americas largest miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce was privatized. These and other developments such as the Philippines 1995 Mining Act led the bank to publish a third report  which endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments and attention to the concerns of the local population. The codes based on this report are influential in the legislation of developing nations. The new codes are intended to encourage development through tax holidays, zero custom duties, reduced income taxes, and related measures. The results of these codes were analyzed by a group from the University of Quebec, which concluded that the codes promote foreign investment but fall very short of permitting sustainable development .

Summarized in the The observed negative correlation between natural resources and economic development is known as the resource curse .       thu   Safety has long been a concern in the mining business, especially in sub-surface mining. The Courrières mine disaster , Europes worst mining accident , involved the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on March 10, 1906. This disaster was surpassed only by the Benxihu Colliery accident in China on April 26, 1942, which killed 1,549 miners. While mining today is substantially safer than it was in previous decades, mining accident s still occur. Government figures indicate that 5,000 Chinese miners die in accidents each year, while other reports have suggested a figure as high as 20,000. . Time .
