              A lawyer or attorney is a person who  |practices_law|Practice_Of_Law| , as an  |advocate|Advocate| ,  |attorney|Wikt:Attorney| ,  |attorney_at_law|Attorney_At_Law| ,  |barrister|Barrister| ,  |barrister-at-law|Barrister-At-Law| ,  |bar-at-law|Bar-At-Law| ,  |canonist|Canonist| , canon lawyer,  |civil_law_notary|Civil_Law_Notary| ,  |counsel|Counsel| , counselor, counsellor,  |solicitor|Solicitor| ,  |legal_executive|Legal_Executive| , or  |public_servant|Public_Servant|  preparing, interpreting and applying law, but not as a  |paralegal|Paralegal|  or charter  |executive_secretary|Executive_Secretary| .  |Henry_Campbell_Black|Henry_Campbell_Black| ,  Blacks Law Dictionary , 5th ed. , 799. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across different legal jurisdictions.  |Geoffrey_C._Hazard,_Jr.|Geoffrey_C._Hazard,_Jr.|  & Angelo Dondi, Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study , 20–23. John Henry Merryman and Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo, The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America, 3rd ed. ,102–103.       In practice, legal jurisdictions exercise their right to determine who is recognized as being a lawyer. As a result, the meaning of the term lawyer may vary from place to place. Some jurisdictions have two types of lawyers,  |barrister|Barrister|  and  |solicitors|Solicitor| , whilst others fuse the two. A barrister is a lawyer who specializes in higher court appearances. A solicitor is a lawyer who is trained to prepare cases and give advice on legal subjects and can represent people in lower courts. Both barristers and solicitors have gone through law school, completed the requisite practical training. However, in jurisdictions where there is a split-profession, only barristers are admitted as members of their respective bar association.     In  |Australia|Australia| , the word lawyer can be used to refer to both  |barristers|Barrister|  and  |solicitors|Solicitor|  , and whoever is admitted as a lawyer of the Supreme Court of a state or territory.   In Canada, the word lawyer only refers to individuals who have been  |called_to_the_bar|Called_To_The_Bar|  or, in  |Quebec|Quebec| , have qualified as civil law notaries. Common  |law|Law|  lawyers in Canada are formally and properly called barristers and solicitors , but should not be referred to as attorneys , since that term has a different meaning in Canadian usage, being a person appointed under a  |power_of_attorney|Power_Of_Attorney| . However, in Quebec, civil law advocates  often call themselves attorney and sometimes barrister and solicitor in English, and all lawyers in Quebec, or lawyers in the rest of Canada when practicing in French, are addressed with the  |honorific|Honorific|  title, Me. or  |Maître|Maître|  .   In  |England|England|  and Wales, lawyer is used to refer to persons who provide reserved and unreserved legal activities and includes practitioners such as  |barristers|Barrister| ,  |attorneys|Attorney_At_Law| ,  |solicitors|Solicitor| , registered foreign lawyers, patent attorneys, trade mark attorneys, licensed conveyancers, public notaries, commissioners for oaths, immigration advisers and claims management services. The  |Legal_Services_Act_2007|Legal_Services_Act_2007|  defines the  legal activities  that may only be performed by a person who is entitled to do so pursuant to the Act. Lawyer is not a protected title.   In Pakistan, the term Advocate is used instead of lawyer in The Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.  |India|India| , the term lawyer is often commonly used, but the official term is  |advocate|Advocateadvocates_In_India|  as prescribed under the Advocates Act, 1961.  , s. 2.   In Scotland, the word lawyer refers to a more specific group of legally trained people. It specifically includes  |advocates|Advocateadvocates_In_Scotland|  and  |solicitors|Solicitorscotland| . In a generic sense, it may also include judges and law-trained support staff.   In the United States, the term generally refers to  |attorneys|Attorneys_In_The_United_States|  who may  |practice_law|Practice_Of_Law| . It is never used to refer to  |patent_agents|Patent_Agent|  Carl W. Battle, The Patent Guide: A Friendly Guide to Protecting and Profiting from Patents , 49. or  |paralegals|Paralegal| . David G. Cooper and Michael J. Gibson, Introduction to Paralegal Studies, 2nd ed., 4. In fact, there are statutory and regulatory restrictions on non-lawyers like paralegals practicing law.    Other nations tend to have comparable terms for the analogous concept.       In most countries, particularly  |civil_law|Civil_Law|  countries, there has been a tradition of giving many legal tasks to a variety of  |civil_law_notaries|Civil_Law_Notary| , clerks, and  |scrivener|Scrivener| .  |Richard_L._Abel|Richard_Abel| , Lawyers in the Civil Law World, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 1–53 , 4. Merryman, 105–109. These countries do not have lawyers in the American sense, insofar as that term refers to a single type of general-purpose legal services provider; Walter O. Reyrauch, The Personality of Lawyers , 27. rather, their legal professions consist of a large number of different kinds of law-trained persons, known as  |jurists|Jurist| , some of whom are  |advocates|Advocate|  who are licensed to practice in the courts. Jon T. Johnsen, The Professionalization of Legal Counseling in Norway, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 54–123 , 91. Kahei Rokumoto, The Present State of Japanese Practicing Attorneys: On the Way to Full Professionalization? in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 160–199 , 164. Merryman, 105. It is difficult to formulate accurate generalizations that cover all the countries with multiple legal professions, because each country has traditionally had its own peculiar method of dividing up legal work among all its different types of legal professionals. Hazard, 21–33.     Notably, England, the mother of the  |common_law|Common_Law|  jurisdictions, emerged from the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  with similar complexity in its legal professions, but then evolved by the 19th century to a single division between  |barristers|Barrister|  and  |solicitors|Solicitor| . An equivalent division developed between advocates and procurators in some civil law countries; these two types did not always monopolize the practice of law, in that they coexisted with civil law notaries.

Several countries that originally had two or more legal professions have since  |fused|Fused_Profession|  or united their professions into a single type of lawyer. Bastard, 299, and Hazard, 45. Harry W. Arthurs, Richard Weisman, and Frederick H. Zemans, Canadian Lawyers: A Peculiar Professionalism, in Lawyers in Society: The Common Law World, vol. 1, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C.

Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 318–368 , 324. Most countries in this category are common law countries, though France, a civil law country, merged its jurists in 1990 and 1991 in response to Anglo-American competition. Anne Boigeol, The Rise of Lawyers in France, in Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe, eds. Lawrence M. Friedman and Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo, 185–219 , 208. In countries with fused professions, a lawyer is usually permitted to carry out all or nearly all the responsibilities listed below.          Arguing a clients case before a  |judge|Judge|  or  |jury|Jury|  in a court of law is the traditional province of the barrister in England, and of advocates in some civil law jurisdictions. Hazard, 30–32. However, the boundary between barristers and solicitors has evolved. In England today, the barrister  |monopoly|Monopoly_Law|  covers only appellate courts, and barristers must compete directly with solicitors in many trial courts. Richard L. Abel, The Legal Profession in England and Wales , 116. In countries like the United States, that have fused legal professions, there are trial lawyers who specialize in trying cases in court, but trial lawyers do not have a  |legal_monopoly|Legal_Monopoly|  like barristers. In some countries, litigants have the option of arguing  pro se , or on their own behalf. It is common for litigants to appear unrepresented before certain courts like  |small_claims_courts|Small_Claims_Court| ; indeed, many such courts do not allow lawyers to speak for their clients, in an effort to save money for all participants in a small case. See, e.g.,  . In other countries, like Venezuela, no one may appear before a judge unless represented by a lawyer. Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo, The Venezuelan Legal Profession: Lawyers in an Inegalitarian Society, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 380–399 , 387. The advantage of the latter regime is that lawyers are familiar with the courts customs and procedures, and make the legal system more efficient for all involved. Unrepresented parties often damage their own credibility or slow the court down as a result of their inexperience. Gordon Kent, Lawyerless Litigants: Is Justice Being Served?  Edmonton Journal , 27 January 2002, A1. Alan Feuer, Lawyering by Laymen: More Litigants Are Taking a Do-It-Yourself Tack,  The New York Times , 22 January 2001, B1.       Often, lawyers brief a court in writing on the issues in a case before the issues can be orally argued. They may have to perform extensive research into relevant facts. Also, they are drafting legal papers and preparing for an oral argument.     In England, the usual division of labor is that a  |solicitor|Solicitor|  will obtain the facts of the case from the client and then brief a barrister . Fiona Boyle, Deveral Capps, Philip Plowden, Clare Sandford, A Practical Guide to Lawyering Skills, 3rd ed. , 47–50. The barrister then researches and drafts the necessary court pleadings and orally argues the case. See Abel, England and Wales, 56 and 141.     In Spain, the procurator merely signs and presents the papers to the court, but it is the advocate who drafts the papers and argues the case. Jene, 369.     In some countries, like Japan, a  |scrivener|Scrivener|  or clerk may fill out court forms and draft simple papers for lay persons who cannot afford or do not need attorneys, and advise them on how to manage and argue their own cases. Rokumoto, 164.       In most developed countries, the legislature has granted  |original_jurisdiction|Original_Jurisdiction|  over highly technical matters to  |executive_branch|Executive_Branch|  administrative agencies which oversee such things. As a result, some lawyers have become specialists in  |administrative_law|Administrative_Law| . In a few countries, there is a special category of jurists with a monopoly over this form of advocacy; for example, France formerly had conseils juridiques . Anne Boigeol, The French Bar: The Difficulties of Unifying a Divided Profession, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 258–294 , 263; and Boigeol, The Rise of Lawyers, 206. In other countries, like the United States, lawyers have been effectively barred by statute from certain types of administrative hearings in order to preserve their informality. Richard L. Abel, American Lawyers , 132. See, e.g., Hines v. Lowrey,  ; Walters v. National Assn of Radiation Survivors,  .       An important aspect of a lawyers job is developing and managing relationships with clients . The client-lawyer relationship is explained in six steps. First, the relationship begins with an intake interview where the lawyer gets to know the client personally. Second step is discovering the facts of the clients case. Thirdly is clarifying what the client wants to accomplish. The fourth step is where the lawyer shapes the clients expectations as to what actually can be accomplished. The second to last step, begins to develop various claims or defenses for the client. Lastly, the lawyer explains her or his fees to the client. Paul J. Zwier & Anthony J. Bocchini, Fact Investigation: A Practical Guide to Interviewing, Counseling, and Case Theory Development , 13–44. John H. Freeman, Client Management for Solicitors , 266–274.     In England, only solicitors were traditionally in direct contact with the client. Abel, England and Wales, 1 and 141. The solicitor retained a barrister if one was necessary and acted as an intermediary between the barrister and the client. J. R. Spencer and  |Richard_M._Jackson|R._M._Jackson| , Jacksons Machinery of Justice, 8th ed. , 336. In most cases barristers were obliged, under what is known as the cab rank rule , to accept instructions for a case in an area in which they held themselves out as practicing, at a court at which they normally appeared and at their usual rates. R.E. Megarry, Lawyer and Litigant in England , 32. Maureen Paton, Cab-rank exits,  The Times , 9 October 2001, 1. This brief article explains the uneasy tension between solicitors and barristers, and the loopholes that have developed. For example, a barrister need not accept a case if the fee is too low or the barrister is just too busy.          Legal advice is the application of abstract principles of law to the concrete facts of the clients case in order to advise the client about what they should do next. In many countries, only a properly licensed lawyer may provide legal advice to clients for good  |consideration|Consideration| , even if no  |lawsuit|Lawsuit|  is contemplated or is in progress. Arthurs, 125; Johnsen, 74; and Pérez-Perdomo, Venezuelan Legal Profession, 387. Erhard Blankenburg and Ulrike Schultz, German Advocates: A Highly Regulated Profession, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 124–159 , 124. Joaquim Falcão, Lawyers in Brazil, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 400–442 , 401. Therefore, even  |conveyancer|Conveyancer|  and corporate in-house counsel must first get a license to practice, though they may actually spend very little of their careers in court. Failure to obey such a rule is the crime of  |unauthorized_practice_of_law|Unauthorized_Practice_Of_Law| . Justine Fischer and Dorothy H. Lackmann, Unauthorized Practice Handbook: A Compilation of Statutes, Cases, and Commentary on the Unauthorized Practice of Law , 30–35.     In other countries, jurists who hold law degrees are allowed to provide legal advice to individuals or to corporations, and it is irrelevant if they lack a license and cannot appear in court. Abel, England and Wales, 185; Bastard, 318. Kees Schuyt, The Rise of Lawyers in the Dutch Welfare State, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 200–224 , 201. Some countries go further; in England and Wales, there is no general prohibition on the giving of legal advice. Stephen J. McGarry, Multidisciplinary Practices and Partnerships: Lawyers, Consultants, and Clients, § 1.06 , 1–29.  |Singapore|Singapore|  does not have any admission requirements for in-house counsel.  Sometimes civil law notaries are allowed to give legal advice, as in Belgium. Luc Huyse, Legal Experts in Belgium, in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 225–257 , 227.     In many countries, non-jurist accountants may provide what is technically legal advice in tax and accounting matters. Murray, 325; and Rokumoto, 164.       In virtually all countries,  |patents|Patent| ,  |trademarks|Trademark| ,  |industrial_designs|Industrial_Design_Rights|  and other forms of  |intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property|  must be formally registered with a government agency in order to receive maximum protection under the law. The division of such work among lawyers, licensed non-lawyer jurists/agents, and ordinary clerks or scriveners varies greatly from one country to the next. Lee Rousso, Japans New Patent Attorney Law Breaches Barrier Between The Legal And Quasi-Legal Professions: Integrity Of Japanese Patent Practice At Risk? 10 Pac. Rim L. & Poly 781, 783–790 .       In some countries, the negotiating and drafting of contracts is considered to be similar to the provision of legal advice, so that it is subject to the licensing requirement explained above. Arthurs, 125; and Pérez-Perdomo, Venezuelan Legal Profession, 387. In others, jurists or notaries may negotiate or draft contracts. Huyse, 227.     Lawyers in some civil law countries traditionally deprecated transactional law or business law as beneath them. French law firms developed transactional departments only in the 1990s when they started to lose business to international firms based in the United States and the United Kingdom . Boigeol, The Rise of Lawyers, 206.       Conveyancing is the drafting of the documents necessary for the transfer of  |real_property|Real_Property| , such as  |deeds|Deed|  and  |mortgages|Mortgage_Law| . In some jurisdictions, all  |real_estate|Real_Estate|  transactions must be carried out by a lawyer . Abel, England and Wales, 176; Hazard, 90–93; Murray, 325; and Pérez-Perdomo, Venezuelan Legal Profession, 387. Such a monopoly is quite valuable from the lawyers point of view; historically, conveyancing accounted for about half of English solicitors income , Abel, England and Wales, 177. and a 1978 study showed that conveyancing accounts for as much as 80 percent of solicitor-client contact in  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales| . Weisbrot, 292. In most common law jurisdictions outside of the United States, this monopoly arose from an 1804 law s. 14 Stamp Act 1804 that was introduced by  |William_Pitt_the_Younger|William_Pitt_The_Younger|  as a  quid pro quo  for the raising of fees on the certification of legal professionals such as barristers, solicitors, attorneys and notaries. Brian Abel-Smith and Robert Stevens, Lawyers and the Courts: A Sociological Study of the English Legal System, 1750–1965 , 23.     In others, the use of a lawyer is optional and banks, title companies, or  |realtors|Realtor|  may be used instead. Weisbrot, 251. In some civil law jurisdictions, real estate transactions are handled by civil law notaries. Arthurs, 125; Huyse, 227; and Schuyt, 201. In England and Wales a special class of legal professional–the  |licensed_conveyancer|Licensed_Conveyancer| –is also allowed to carry out conveyancing services for reward. Simon Domberger and Avrom Sherr, The Impact of Competition on Pricing and Quality of Legal Services, in The Regulatory Challenge, eds. Matthew Bishop, John Kay, Colin Mayer, 119–137 , 121–122.       In many countries, only lawyers have the legal authority to draft  |wills|Will| ,  |trusts|Trust_Law| , and any other documents that ensure the efficient disposition of a persons property after death. In some civil law countries this responsibility is handled by civil law notaries.     In the United States, the estates of the deceased must generally be administered by a court through  |probate|Probate| . American lawyers have a profitable monopoly on dispensing advice about probate law . Ralph Warner & Stephen Elias, Fed Up with the Legal System: Whats Wrong & How to Fix It , 11.       In many civil law countries,  |prosecutors|Prosecutor|  are trained and employed as part of the judiciary; they are law-trained jurists, but may not necessarily be lawyers in the sense that the word is used in the common law world. Hazard, 34–35; Huyse, 227; Merryman, 105, and Schuyt, 201. In common law countries, prosecutors are usually lawyers holding regular licenses who simply happen to work for the government office that files criminal charges against suspects.  |Criminal_defense_lawyers|Criminal_Defense_Lawyer|  specialize in the defense of those charged with any crimes. Larry J. Siegel and Joseph J. Senna, Introduction to Criminal Justice, 10th ed. , 311–325.             The educational prerequisites for becoming a lawyer vary greatly from country to country. In some countries, law is taught by a  |faculty_of_law|Faculty_Of_Law| , which is a department of a universitys general undergraduate college. Lawrence M. Friedman and Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo, Latin Legal Cultures in the Age of Globalization, in Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe, eds. Lawrence M. Friedman and Rogelio Pérez-Perdomo, 1–19 , 6. Law students in those countries pursue a  |Master|Master_Of_Laws|  or  |Bachelor_of_Laws|Bachelor_Of_Laws|  degree. In some countries it is common or even required for students to earn another bachelors degree at the same time. It is often followed by a series of advanced examinations, apprenticeships, and additional coursework at special government institutes. Abel, England and Wales, 45–59; Rokumoto, 165; and Schuyt, 204.     In other countries, particularly the UK and  |U.S.A.|Admission_To_The_Bar_In_The_United_States| , law is primarily taught at  |law_schools|Law_School| .  In America, the American Bar Association decides which law schools to approve and thereby which ones are deemed most respectable.  In England and Wales,  the  |Bar_Professional_Training_Course|Bar_Professional_Training_Course|  must be taken to have the right to work and be named as a  |barrister|Barrister| . Students who decide to pursue a non-law subject at degree level can instead study the  |Graduate_Diploma_in_Law|Common_Professional_Examination|  after their degrees, before beginning the  |Legal_Practice_Course|Legal_Practice_Course|  or BPTC. In the United States Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, The Legal Profession: Is it for you? , 52–53. and countries following the American model,  law schools are graduate/professional schools where a bachelors degree is a prerequisite for admission. Most law schools are part of universities but a few are independent institutions. Law schools in the United States  and Canada  award graduating students a J.D.   as the practitioners law degree. Many schools also offer post-doctoral law degrees such as the LL.M , or the  |S.J.D.|S.J.D.|  for students interested in advancing their research knowledge and credentials in a specific area of law. Christen Civiletto Carey and Kristen David Adams, The Practice of Law School: Getting In and Making the Most of Your Legal Education , 525.     The methods and quality of legal education vary widely. Some countries require extensive clinical training in the form of apprenticeships or special clinical courses. Hazard, 127–129; Merryman, 103; and Olgiati, 345. Others, like Venezuela, do not. Pérez-Perdomo, Venezuelan Legal Profession, 384. A few countries prefer to teach through assigned readings of judicial opinions  followed by intense in-class cross-examination by the professor . Robert H. Miller, Law School Confidential: A Complete Guide to the Law School Experience, By Students, for Students , 25–27. Anderson, 4–10. Many others have only lectures on highly abstract legal doctrines, which forces young lawyers to figure out how to actually think and write like a lawyer at their first apprenticeship . Blankenburg, 132; Friedman and Pérez-Perdomo, 6; Hazard, 124–128; and Olgiati, 345. Sergio Lopez-Ayllon and Hector Fix-Figaro, Faraway, So Close!

Depending upon the country, a typical class size could range from five students in a seminar to five hundred in a giant lecture room. In the United States, law schools maintain small class sizes, and as such, grant admissions on a more limited and competitive basis. Miller, 42–60.     Some countries, particularly industrialized ones, have a traditional preference for full-time law programs, Abel, American Lawyers, 57; Miller, 25; and Murray, 337. while in developing countries, students often work full- or part-time to pay the tuition and fees of their part-time law programs. Falcão, 410. J.S. Gandhi, Past and Present: A Sociological Portrait of the Indian Legal Profession, in Lawyers in Society: The Common Law World, vol. 1, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 369–382 , 375.     Law schools in developing countries share several common problems, such as an over reliance on practicing judges and lawyers who treat teaching as a part-time hobby ; Lopez-Ayllon, 324. Eliane Botelho Junqueira, Brazil: The Road of Conflict Bound for Total Justice, in Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe, eds. Lawrence M.

Friedman and Rogelio Perez-Perdomo, 414–478 , 459. For example, a 1997 study found that not a single law school in Venezuela had bothered to integrate any part of the Convention on Childrens Rights into its curriculum, even though Venezuela had signed the treaty in 1990 and subsequently modified its domestic laws to bring them into compliance. Rather than embark on curriculum reform, Venezuelan law schools now offer special postgraduate courses so that recent graduates can bring their legal knowledge up-to-date with current law.             Some jurisdictions grant a  |diploma_privilege|Diploma_Privilege|  to certain institutions, so that merely earning a degree or credential from those institutions is the primary qualification for practicing law. Abel, American Lawyers, 62.  |Mexico|Mexico|  allows anyone with a law degree to practice law. Lopez-Ayllon, 330. However, in a large number of countries, a law student must pass a  |bar_examination|Bar_Examination|  before receiving a license to practice. Hazard, 127, 129, & 133; Miller, 335–341. Alan A. Paterson, The Legal Profession in Scotland: An Endangered Species or a Problem Case for Market Theory? in Lawyers in Society: The Common Law World, vol. 1, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 76–122 , 89. In a handful of  |U.S._states|U.S._State| , one may become an attorney  by simply  |reading_law|Reading_Law|  and passing the bar examination, without having to attend law school first . G. Jeffrey MacDonald, The self-made lawyer: Not every attorney goes to law school,  The Christian Science Monitor , 3 June 2003, 13.     Some countries require a formal apprenticeship with an experienced practitioner, while others do not. Hazard, 129 & 133. For example, a few jurisdictions still allow an apprenticeship in place of any kind of formal legal education . Weisbrot, 266.     Some countries, such as  |Singapore|Singapore| , do not have any admission requirements for in-house counsel.           The career structure of lawyers varies widely from one country to the next.       In most  |common_law|Common_Law|  countries, especially those with fused professions, lawyers have many options over the course of their careers. Besides private practice, they can become a  |prosecutor|Prosecutor| , government counsel, corporate in-house counsel,  |administrative_law_judge|Administrative_Law_Judge| ,  |judge|Judge| ,  |arbitrator|Arbitrator| , or  |law_professor|Law_Professor| . Abel, American Lawyers, 167–175; Abel, England and Wales, 214; Arthurs, 131; Gandhi, 374; Merryman, 102, and Weisbrot, 277. There are also many non-legal jobs for which legal training is good preparation, such as  |politician|Politician| ,  |corporate_executive|Corporate_Executive| , government administrator,  |investment_banker|Investment_Banker| ,  |entrepreneur|Entrepreneur| , or  |journalist|Journalist| . Anderson, 124–131. In developing countries like India, a large majority of law students never actually practice, but simply use their law degree as a foundation for careers in other fields. Gandhi, 374.     In most civil law countries, lawyers generally structure their legal education around their chosen specialty; the boundaries between different types of lawyers are carefully defined and hard to cross. In general, see, Legomsky, Stephen H. Specialized Justice: Courts, Administrative Tribunals, and a Cross-National Theory of Specialization Oxford University Press, New York,  After one earns a law degree, career mobility may be severely constrained. Merryman, 102–105. For example, unlike their American counterparts, Although it is common for former American judges to return to private practice, it is highly controversial for them to suggest that they still retain any judicial powers . Brad McElhinny,  |Workman|Margaret_Workman|  criticized for using robe in ad: Group files State Bar complaint about the way former justice seeks clients,  Charleston Daily Mail , 3 February 2005, 1A. it is difficult for German judges to leave the bench and become advocates in private practice. Blankenburg, 133. Another interesting example is France, where for much of the 20th century, all judiciary officials were graduates of an elite professional school for judges. Although the French judiciary has begun experimenting with the Anglo-American model of appointing judges from accomplished advocates, the few advocates who have actually joined the bench this way are looked down upon by their colleagues who have taken the traditional route to judicial office. Boigeol, The Rise of Lawyers, 202.     In a few civil law countries, such as Sweden, Bernard Michael Ortwein II, The Swedish Legal System: An Introduction, 13 Ind. Intl & Comp. L. Rev. 405, 440–445 . the legal profession is not rigorously bifurcated and everyone within it can easily change roles and arenas.       In many countries, lawyers are general practitioners who represent clients in a broad field of legal matters. Hazard, 39–43; Olgiati, 353. In others, there has been a tendency since the start of the 20th century for lawyers to specialize early in their careers. Abel, American Lawyers, 122. Michael H. Trotter, Profit and the Practice of Law: Whats Happened to the Legal Profession , 50.     In countries where specialization is prevalent, many lawyers specialize in representing one side in one particular area of the law; thus, it is common in the  |United_States|United_States|  to hear of plaintiffs  |personal_injury|Personal_Injury|  attorneys. Herbert M. Kritzer, The fracturing legal profession: the case of plaintiffs personal injury lawyers, 8 Intl J. Legal Prof. 225, 228–231 . Information for lawyers - http://abogadomartin.es/hurto/ Penalista para hurto Texas offers attorneys the opportunity to receive a board certification through the states  |Texas_Board_of_Legal_Specialization|Texas_Board_Of_Legal_Specialization| . To be board certified, attorney applicants undergo a rigorous examination in one of 24 areas of practice offered by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization. Only those attorneys who are board certified are permitted to use the word specialize in any publicly accessible materials such as a website or television commercial. See Texas Rule 7.02. Texas Bar Rule 7.02 - https://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/ForLawyers/MembershipInformation/AdvertisingReview2/TDRPCVII.pdf TexasBar.com            Lawyers in private practice generally work in specialized  |business|Business| es known as  |law_firms|Law_Firm| , Anderson, 111–117. with the exception of English barristers. The vast majority of law firms worldwide are  |small_business|Small_Business| es that range in size from 1 to 10 lawyers. Hazard, 39. The United States, with its large number of firms with more than 50 lawyers, is an exception. Junqueira, 92. According to this source, as of 2003, there were 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers in the United States. The United Kingdom and Australia are also exceptions, as the UK, Australia and the U.S. are now home to several firms with more than 1,000 lawyers after a wave of mergers in the late 1990s.     Notably,  |barristers|Barrister|  in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some states in Australia do not work in law firms . Those who offer their services to members of the general public—as opposed to those working in-house — are required to be self-employed. Gary Slapper and David Kelly, The English Legal System, 7th ed. , 550. Most work in groupings known as sets or chambers , where some administrative and marketing costs are shared. An important effect of this different organizational structure is that there is no  |conflict_of_interest|Conflict_Of_Interest|  where barristers in the same chambers work for opposing sides in a case, and in some specialized chambers this is commonplace.              In some jurisdictions, either the judiciary Weisbrot, 264. or the Ministry of Justice Johnsen, 86. directly supervises the admission, licensing, and regulation of lawyers.     Other jurisdictions, by statute, tradition, or court order, have granted such powers to a professional association which all lawyers must belong to. Boigeol, “The French Bar,” 271; Merryman, 106, and Junqueira, 89. In the U.S., such associations are known as mandatory, integrated, or unified  |bar_associations|Bar_Association| . In the Commonwealth of Nations, similar organizations are known as  |Inns_of_Court|Inns_Of_Court| ,  |bar_councils|Bar_Council|  or  |law_societies|Law_Society| . Abel, England and Wales, 127 and 243–249; Arthurs, 135; and Weisbrot, 279. In civil law countries, comparable organizations are known as Orders of Advocates, Bastard, 295; and Falcão, 401. Chambers of Advocates, Blankenburg, 139. Colleges of Advocates, Jene, 370. Faculties of Advocates, Paterson, 79. or similar names. Generally, a nonmember caught practicing law may be liable for the crime of  |unauthorized_practice_of_law|Unauthorized_Practice_Of_Law| . Arthurs, 143.     In common law countries with divided legal professions, barristers traditionally belong to the bar council and solicitors belong to the law society. In the English-speaking world, the largest mandatory professional association of lawyers is the  |State_Bar_of_California|State_Bar_Of_California| , with 230,000 members.     Some countries admit and regulate lawyers at the national level, so that a lawyer, once licensed, can argue cases in any court in the land. This is common in small countries like New Zealand, Japan, and Belgium. Murray, 339; Rokumoto, 163; and Schuyt, 207. Others, especially those with federal governments, tend to regulate lawyers at the state or provincial level; this is the case in the United States, Abel, American Lawyers, 116. Canada, Arthurs, 139. Australia, Weisbrot, 244. and Switzerland, Bastard, 299. to name a few. Brazil is the most well-known federal government that regulates lawyers at the national level. Falcão, 404.     Some countries, like Italy, regulate lawyers at the regional level, Olgiati, 343. and a few, like Belgium, even regulate them at the local level . Huyse, 239. In Germany, lawyers are admitted to regional bars and may appear for clients before all courts nationwide with the exception of the  |Federal_Court_of_Justice_of_Germany|Federal_Court_Of_Justice_Of_Germany|  ; oddly, securing admission to the BGHs bar limits a lawyers practice solely to the supreme federal courts and the  |Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany|Federal_Constitutional_Court_Of_Germany| . Howard D. Fisher, The German Legal System and Legal Language, 3rd ed. , 208–209.     Generally, geographic limitations can be troublesome for a lawyer who discovers that his clients cause requires him to litigate in a court beyond the normal geographic scope of his license. Although most courts have special  pro hac vice  rules for such occasions, the lawyer will still have to deal with a different set of  |professional_responsibility|Professional_Responsibility|  rules, as well as the possibility of other differences in substantive and procedural law.     Some countries grant licenses to non-resident lawyers, who may then appear regularly on behalf of foreign clients. Others require all lawyers to live in the jurisdiction or to even hold national citizenship as a prerequisite for receiving a license to practice. But the trend in industrialized countries since the 1970s has been to abolish citizenship and residency restrictions. For example, the  |Supreme_Court_of_Canada|Supreme_Court_Of_Canada|  struck down a citizenship requirement on equality rights grounds in 1989,  Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia  1 SCR 143. and similarly, American citizenship and residency requirements were struck down as unconstitutional by the  |U.S._Supreme_Court|U.S._Supreme_Court|  in 1973 and 1985, respectively. Abel, American Lawyers, 68. The  |European_Court_of_Justice|European_Court_Of_Justice|  made similar decisions in 1974 and 1977 striking down citizenship restrictions in Belgium and France. Mary C. Daly, Ethical and Liability Issues in International Legal Practice, in Comparative Law Yearbook of International Business, vol. 17, eds. Dennis Campbell and Susan Cotter, 223–268 , 233.       A key difference among countries is whether lawyers should be regulated solely by an independent judiciary and its subordinate institutions , For a classic explanation of the self-regulating legal profession, see the  to the  |ABA_Model_Rules_of_Professional_Conduct|Aba_Model_Rules_Of_Professional_Conduct| , ¶¶ 10–13. or whether lawyers should be subject to supervision by the  |Ministry_of_Justice|Ministry_Of_Justice|  in the  |executive_branch|Executive_Branch| .     In most civil law countries, the government has traditionally exercised tight control over the legal profession in order to ensure a steady supply of loyal judges and bureaucrats. That is, lawyers were expected first and foremost to serve the state, and the availability of counsel for private litigants was an afterthought. Abel, Civil Law World, 10; Johnsen, 70; Olgiati, 339; and Rokumoto, 161. Even in civil law countries like Norway which have partially self-regulating professions, the Ministry of Justice is the sole issuer of licenses, and makes its own independent re-evaluation of a lawyers fitness to practice after a lawyer has been expelled from the Advocates Association. Brazil is an unusual exception in that its national Order of Advocates has become a fully self-regulating institution and has successfully resisted government attempts to place it under the control of the Ministry of Labor. Falcão, 423. Maria da Gloria Bonelli, Lawyers Associations and the Brazilian State, 1843–1997, 28 Law & Soc. Inquiry 1045, 1065 .     Of all the civil law countries, Communist countries historically went the farthest towards total state control, with all Communist lawyers forced to practice in collectives by the mid-1950s. Kandis Scott, Decollectivization and Democracy: Current Law Practice in Romania, 36 Geo. Wash. Intl L. Rev. 817, 820. . Timothy J. Tyler, Judging the Past: Germanys Post-Unification Lawyers Admissions Review Law, 29 Tex. Intl L.J. 457, 472 . China is a prime example: technically, the Peoples Republic of China did not have lawyers, and instead had only poorly trained, state-employed legal workers, prior to the enactment of a comprehensive reform package in 1996 by the  |Standing_Committee_of_the_National_Peoples_Congress|Standing_Committee_Of_The_National_Peoples_Congress| . Michael J. Moser, Globalization and Legal Services in China: Current Status and Future Directions, in The Internationalization of the Practice of Law, eds. Jens I. Drolhammer and Michael Pfeifer, 127–136 , 128–129.     In contrast, common law lawyers have traditionally regulated themselves through institutions where the influence of non-lawyers, if any, was weak and indirect . Abel, American Lawyers, 142–143; Abel, England and Wales, 29; and Arthurs, 148. Such institutions have been traditionally dominated by private practitioners who opposed strong state control of the profession on the grounds that it would endanger the ability of lawyers to zealously and competently advocate their clients causes in the  |adversarial_system|Adversarial_System|  of justice. Arthurs, 138; and Weisbrot, 281.     However, the concept of the self-regulating profession has been criticized as a sham which serves to legitimize the professional monopoly while protecting the profession from public scrutiny. Abel, American Lawyers, 246–247. Disciplinary mechanisms have been astonishingly ineffective, and penalties have been light or nonexistent. Abel, American Lawyers, 147; Abel, England and Wales, 135 and 250; Arthurs, 146; Hazard, 135; Paterson, 104; and Weisbrot, 284. Richard L. Abel, English Lawyers Between Market and State: The Politics of Professionalism , 374–375. William T. Gallagher, Ideologies of Professionalism and the Politics of Self-Regulation in the California State Bar, 22 Pepp. L. Rev. 485, 490–491 .       Lawyers are always free to form voluntary associations of their own, apart from any licensing or mandatory membership that may be required by the laws of their jurisdiction. Like their mandatory counterparts, such organizations may exist at all geographic levels. Abel, England and Wales, 132–133. In American English, such associations are known as voluntary bar associations. Arthurs, 141. The largest voluntary professional association of lawyers in the English-speaking world is the  |American_Bar_Association|American_Bar_Association| .     In some countries, like  |France|France|  and  |Italy|Italy| , lawyers have also formed  |trade_unions|Trade_Union| . Boigeol, “The French Bar,” 274; and Olgiati, 344.          Hostility towards the legal profession is a widespread phenomenon. The legal profession was abolished in  |Prussia|Prussia|  in 1780 and in France in 1789, though both countries eventually realized that their judicial systems could not function efficiently without lawyers. Blankenburg, 126; and Boigeol, “The French Bar,” 272. Complaints about too many lawyers were common in both England and the United States in the 1840s, Abel, England and Wales, 37. Gerald W. Gawalt, Sources of Anti-Lawyer Sentiment in Massachusetts, 1740–1840, in Essays in Nineteenth-Century American Legal History, ed. Wythe Holt, 624–648 , 624–625. According to this source, the strong anti-lawyer sentiment of the period was rather ironic, since lawyers were actually so scarce in the American colonies that a 1715 Massachusetts law forbade litigants from retaining two lawyers because of the risk of depriving ones opponent of counsel. Germany in the 1910s, Blankenburg, 127. and in Australia, Weisbrot, 246. Canada, Arthurs, 128. the United States, Marc Galanter, Predators and Parasites: Lawyer-Bashing and Civil Justice, 28 Ga. L. Rev. 633, 644–648 . Stephen D. Easton, Fewer Lawyers? Try Getting Your Day in Court, Wall Street Journal, 27 November 1984, 1. This article rebuts the common complaint of too many lawyers in the U.S. by pointing out that it is virtually impossible for a plaintiff to prevail in the vast majority of countries with less lawyers, like Japan, because there are simply not enough lawyers or judges to go around. Even wrongful death cases with clear evidence of fault can drag on for decades in Japan. Thus, any reduction in the number of lawyers would result in reduced enforcement of individual rights.  |Gerry_Spence|Gerry_Spence| , With Justice For None: Destroying An American Myth , 27–40 and  |Scotland|Scotland|  Paterson, 76. in the 1980s.     Public distrust of lawyers reached record heights in the United States after the  |Watergate_scandal|Watergate_Scandal| . Jerold Auerbach, Unequal Justice: Lawyers and Social Change in Modern America , 301. In the aftermath of Watergate, legal self-help books became popular among those who wished to solve their legal problems without having to deal with lawyers. For examples of legal self-help books written by lawyers which concede that the profession has a bad image, see  |Mark_H._McCormack|Mark_Mccormack| , The Terrible Truth About Lawyers , 11; Kenneth Menendez, Taming the Lawyers , 2; and Stuart Kahan and Robert M. Cavallo, Do I Really Need A Lawyer? , 2. Lawyer jokes also soared in popularity in  |English|English_Language| -speaking  |North_America|North_America|  as a result of Watergate. Gayle White, So, a lawyer, a skunk and a catfish walk into a bar...: No shortage of jokes,  National Post , 27 May 2006, FW8. In 1989, American legal self-help publisher  |Nolo_Press|Nolo_Press|  published a 171-page compilation of negative anecdotes about lawyers from throughout human history. Andrew Roth & Jonathan Roth, Devils Advocates: The Unnatural History of Lawyers , ix.     In Adventures in Law and Justice , legal researcher  |Bryan_Horrigan|Bryan_Horrigan|  dedicated a chapter to Myths, Fictions, and Realities about law and illustrated the perennial criticism of lawyers as amoral guns for hire  |Bryan_Horrigan|Bryan_Horrigan| , Myths, Fictions, and Realities , in Adventures in Law and Justice: Exploring Big Legal Questions in Everyday Life, Law at Large, 55–82 , 55 & 62–66. Bierce is quoted p. . with a quote from  |Ambrose_Bierces|Ambrose_Bierce|  satirical  The Devils Dictionary  that summarized the noun as: LAWYER, n. One skilled in circumvention of the law.  |Ambrose_Bierce|Ambrose_Bierce| , , in  The Devils Dictionary  , electronic entry at  |Dict.org|Dict.Org| . Also found quoted in many legal books.     More generally, in Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study , law professor  |Geoffrey_C._Hazard,_Jr.|Geoffrey_C._Hazard,_Jr.|  with Angelo Dondi briefly examined the regulations attempting to suppress lawyer misconduct and noted that their similarity around the world was paralleled by a remarkable consistency in certain persistent grievances about lawyers that transcends both time and locale, from the Bible to medieval England to dynastic China. Hazard, . The authors then generalized these common complaints about lawyers as being classified into five general categories as follows:     abuse of litigation in various ways, including using dilatory tactics and false evidence and making frivolous arguments to the courts   preparation of  |false_documentation|False_Documentation| , such as false deeds, contracts, or wills    |deceiving|Deceiving|  clients and other persons and misappropriating property    |procrastination|Procrastination|  in dealings with clients   charging excessive  |fees|Fee|  Hazard, 60.     Some studies have shown that suicide rates among lawyers may be as much as six times higher than the average population, and commentators suggest that the low opinion the public has of lawyers, combined with their own high ideals of justice, which in practice they may see denied, increase the depression rates of those in this profession.   Additionally, lawyers are twice as likely to suffer from addiction to alcohol and other drugs.              In the United States, lawyers typically earn between $45,000 and $160,000 per year, although earnings vary by age and experience, practice setting, sex, and race. United States Census Bureau, American Community Survey United States Census Bureau,  United States Department of Labor,     Solo practitioners typically earn less than lawyers in corporate law firms but more than those working for state or local government.     Lawyers are paid for their work in a variety of ways. In private practice, they may work for an hourly fee according to a billable hour structure, Anderson, 111–112. a  |contingency_fee|Contingency_Fee|  Herbert M. Kritzer, Risks, Reputations, and Rewards: Contingency Fee Legal Practice in the United States , 258–259. According to this source, contingency fees  are allowed, as of 2004, in Canada, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, the Dominican Republic, Greece, France, Brazil, Japan, and the United States. , or a lump sum payment if the matter is straightforward. Normally, most lawyers negotiate a written fee agreement up front and may require a non-refundable  |retainer|Advance_Payment|  in advance. Recent studies suggest that when lawyers charge a fixed-fee rather than billing by the hour, they work less hard on behalf of clients and client get worse outcomes.   In many countries there are fee-shifting arrangements by which the loser must pay the winners fees and costs; the United States is the major exception, See Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co.,  . although in turn, its legislators have carved out many exceptions to the so-called American Rule of no fee shifting.     Lawyers working directly on the payroll of governments, nonprofits, and corporations usually earn a regular annual salary. Anderson, 120–121. In many countries, with the notable exception of Germany, Matthias Kilian and Francis Regan, Legal expenses insurance and legal aid—two sides of the same coin? The experience from Germany and Sweden, 11 Intl J. Legal Prof. 233, 239 . According to this article, pro bono arrangements are illegal in Germany. lawyers can also volunteer their labor in the service of worthy causes through an arrangement called  pro bono  . Abel, American Lawyers, 129–130. Traditionally such work was performed on behalf of the poor, but in some countries it has now expanded to many other causes such as the  |environment|Environment| .     In some countries, there are  |legal_aid|Legal_Aid|  lawyers who specialize in providing legal services to the indigent. Abel, American Lawyers, 133. Arthurs, 161; Murray, 342; Pérez-Perdomo, 392; Schuyt, 211; and Weisbrot, 288. France and Spain even have formal fee structures by which lawyers are compensated by the government for legal aid cases on a per-case basis. Boigeol, “The French Bar,” 280; and Jene, 376. A similar system, though not as extensive or generous, operates in Australia, Canada, and  |South_Africa|South_Africa| .      In other countries, legal aid specialists are practically nonexistent. This may be because non-lawyers are allowed to provide such services; in both  |Italy|Italy|  and  |Belgium|Belgium| , trade unions and political parties provide what can be characterized as legal aid services. Olgiati, 354, and Huyse, 240. Some legal aid in Belgium is also provided by young lawyer apprentices subsidized by local bar associations , as well as consumer protection nonprofit organizations and Public Assistance Agencies subsidized by local governments. Huyse, 240–241. In Germany, mandatory fee structures have enabled widespread implementation of affordable  |legal_expense_insurance|Legal_Expense_Insurance| . Blankenburg, 143.                 The earliest people who could be described as lawyers were probably the  |orators|Orators|  of ancient  |Athens|Athens|  . However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a friend for assistance. Robert J. Bonner, Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens: The Genesis of the Legal Profession , 202. However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend. Bonner, 204. Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could never present themselves as legal professionals or experts. Bonner, 206. They had to uphold the  |legal_fiction|Legal_Fiction|  that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession—with professional associations and titles and all the other pomp and circumstance—like their modern counterparts. Bonner, 208–209. Therefore, if one narrows the definition to those men who could practice the legal profession openly and legally, then the first lawyers would have to be the orators of  |ancient_Rome|Ancient_Rome| . Hazard, 18.       A law enacted in 204 BC barred Roman advocates from taking fees, but the law was widely ignored.  |John_A._Crook|John_Crook| , Law and Life of Ancient Rome , 90. The ban on fees was abolished by  |Emperor_Claudius|Claudius| , who legalized advocacy as a profession and allowed the Roman advocates to become the first lawyers who could practice openly—but he also imposed a fee ceiling of 10,000  |sesterces|Sestertius| . Crook, 90. Crook cites  |Tacitus|Tacitus| , Annals VI, 5 and 7 for this point. For more information about the complex political affair that forced Emperor Claudius to decide this issue, see The Annals of Tacitus, Book VI , 208. This was apparently not much money; the  |Satires_of_Juvenal|Satires_Of_Juvenal|  complained that there was no money in working as an advocate. Crook, 91.     Like their Greek contemporaries, early Roman advocates were trained in  |rhetoric|Rhetoric| , not law, and the judges before whom they argued were also not law-trained. Crook, 87. But very early on, unlike Athens, Rome developed a class of specialists who were learned in the law, known as jurisconsults . Crook, 88. Jurisconsults were wealthy amateurs who dabbled in law as an intellectual hobby; they did not make their primary living from it. They gave legal opinions  on legal issues to all comers . Crook, 89. Roman judges and governors would routinely consult with an advisory panel of jurisconsults before rendering a decision, and advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions. Thus, the Romans were the first to have a class of people who spent their days thinking about legal problems, and this is why their law became so precise, detailed, and technical.        During the  |Roman_Republic|Roman_Republic|  and the early  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| , jurisconsults and advocates were unregulated, since the former were amateurs and the latter were technically illegal. Crook, 90. Any citizen could call himself an advocate or a legal expert, though whether people believed him would depend upon his personal reputation. This changed once Claudius legalized the legal profession. By the start of the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| , the legal profession had become well-established, heavily regulated, and highly stratified. A. H. M. Jones, The Later Roman Empire, 284–602: A Social, Economic, and Administrative Survey, vol. 1 , 507. The centralization and bureaucratization of the profession was apparently gradual at first, but accelerated during the reign of Emperor  |Hadrian|Hadrian| . Fritz Schulz, History of Roman Legal Science , 113. At the same time, the jurisconsults went into decline during the imperial period. Schulz, 113.     In the words of  |Fritz_Schulz|Fritz_Schulz| , by the fourth century things had changed in the eastern Empire: advocates now were really lawyers. Schulz, 268. For example, by the fourth century, advocates had to be enrolled on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court. Jones, 508–510. By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric ; in 460,  |Emperor_Leo|Leo_I_The_Thracian|  imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission. Jones, 512–513. Claudiuss fee ceiling lasted all the way into the Byzantine period, though by then it was measured at 100  |solidi|Solidus| . Jones, 511. It was widely evaded, either through demands for maintenance and expenses or a sub rosa  |barter|Barter|  transaction. The latter was cause for disbarment.     The notaries  appeared in the late Roman Empire. Like their modern-day descendants, the civil law notaries, they were responsible for drafting wills, conveyances, and contracts. Jones, 515. They were ubiquitous and most villages had one. In Roman times, notaries were widely considered to be inferior to advocates and jury consults.          After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the onset of the Early Middle Ages, the legal profession of Western Europe collapsed. As James Brundage has explained: no one in Western Europe could properly be described as a professional lawyer or a professional canonist in anything like the modern sense of the term professional. James A. Brundage, The Rise of the Professional Jurist in the Thirteenth Century, 20 Syracuse J. Intl L. & Com. 185 . However, from  |1150|Decretum_Gratiani|  onward, a small but increasing number of men became experts in  |canon_law|Canon_Law_Of_The_Catholic_Church|  but only in furtherance of other occupational goals, such as serving the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  as priests. Brundage, 185–186. From 1190 to 1230, however, there was a crucial shift in which some men began to practice canon law as a lifelong profession in itself. Brundage, 186–187.     The legal professions return was marked by the renewed efforts of church and state to regulate it. In 1231, two French councils mandated that lawyers had to swear an oath of admission before practicing before the bishops courts in their regions, and a similar oath was promulgated by the  |papal_legate|Papal_Legate|  in London in 1237. Brundage, 188. During the same decade, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire  |Frederick_II|Frederick_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , the king of the  |Kingdom_of_Sicily|Kingdom_Of_Sicily| , imposed a similar oath in his civil courts. Brundage, 188–189. By 1250, the nucleus of a new legal profession had clearly formed. Brundage, 190. The new trend towards professionalization culminated in a controversial proposal at the  |Second_Council_of_Lyon|Second_Council_Of_Lyon|  in 1275 that all ecclesiastical courts should require an oath of admission. Brundage, 189. Although not adopted by the council, it was highly influential in many such courts throughout  |Europe|Europe| . The civil courts in England also joined the trend towards professionalization; in 1275 a statute was enacted that prescribed punishment for professional lawyers guilty of  |deceit|Deception| ,  |Statute_of_Westminster_1275|Statute_Of_Westminster_1275| , ch. 29. and in 1280 the mayors court of the city of London promulgated regulations concerning admission procedures, including the administering of an oath. John Hamilton Baker, An Introduction to British Legal History, 3rd ed. , 179. And in 1345, the French crown promulgated a royal ordinance which set forth 24 rules governing advocates, of which 12 were integrated into the oath to be taken by them. Lucien Karpik, French Lawyers: A Study in Collective Action, 1274 to 1994 , 21.     The French medieval oaths were widely influential and of enduring importance; for example, they directly influenced the structure of the advocates oath adopted by the  |Canton_of_Geneva|Canton_Of_Geneva|  in 1816. Carol Rice Andrews, Standards of Conduct for Lawyers: An 800-Year Evolution, 57 SMU L. Rev. 1385 .
