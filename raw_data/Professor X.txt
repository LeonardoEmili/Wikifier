|Professor|Professor|  Charles Francis Xavier  is a fictional character appearing in  |American_comic_books|American_Comic_Book|  published by  |Marvel_Comics|Marvel_Comics| . The character is depicted as the founder and sometimes leader of the  |X-Men|X-Men| . Created by writer  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  and artist  |Jack_Kirby|Jack_Kirby| , the character first appeared in  |The_X-Men|Uncanny_X-Men|  1 .     Xavier is a member of a subspecies of humans known as  |mutants|Mutant| , who are born with superhuman abilities. The founder of the  |X-Men|X-Men| , Xavier is an exceptionally powerful  |telepath|Telepath|  who can read and control the minds of others. To both shelter and train mutants from around the world, he runs a private school in the  |X-Mansion|X-Mansion|  in  |Salem_Center|Salem_Center,_New_York| , located in  |Westchester_County,_New_York|Westchester_County,_New_York| .  Xavier also strives to serve a greater good by promoting peaceful coexistence and equality between humans and mutants in a world where zealous anti-mutant  |bigotry|Bigotry|  is widespread.     Throughout much of the characters history in comics, Xavier is a  |paraplegic|Paraplegia|  variously using either a wheelchair or a modified version of one. One of the worlds most powerful  |mutant|Mutant|  telepaths, Xavier is a  |scientific|Science| |genius|Genius|  and a leading authority in  |genetics|Genetics| . Furthermore, he has shown noteworthy talents in devising equipment to greatly enhance psionic powers. Xavier is perhaps best known in this regard for the creation of a device called  |Cerebro|Cerebro| , a technology that serves to detect and track those individuals possessing the mutant gene, at the same time greatly expanding the gifts of those with existing psionic abilities.     From a social policy and philosophical perspective, Xavier deeply resents the violent methods of those like his former close friend and occasional enemy, the  |supervillain|Supervillain| |Magneto|Magneto| . Instead, he has presented his platform of uncompromising pacifism to see his dream to fruition – one that seeks to live harmoniously alongside humanity, just the same as it desires full-fledged civil rights and equality for all mutants. Xaviers actions and goals in life have therefore often been compared to those of  |Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|  for his involvement with the  |American_civil_rights_struggle|Civil_Rights_Movement| ,  whereas Magneto is often compared with the more militant civil rights activist  |Malcolm_X|Malcolm_X| .     The characters creation and development occurred simultaneously with the civil rights struggle, taking place in the 1960s, while Xaviers first appearance dates to 1963. The fictionalized plight in the comics of mutantkind faced with exceptional intolerance and prejudice was done in large part to better illustrate to audiences of the day what was transpiring across the United States, just the same as it also served to further promote ideals of tolerance and equality for all.       |Patrick_Stewart|Patrick_Stewart|  portrayed the character in the first four films in the  |X-Men_film_series|X-Men|  and in various video games, while  |James_McAvoy|James_Mcavoy|  portrayed a younger version of the character in the 2011 prequel  X-Men: First Class . Both actors reprised the role in the film  X-Men: Days of Future Past . McAvoy reprised the role in  X-Men: Apocalypse , and Stewart in  Logan . McAvoy made a cameo in  Deadpool 2  and reprised his role in  Dark Phoenix .  |Harry_Lloyd|Harry_Lloyd|  portrayed the character in the third season of the television series  Legion .          Created by writer  |Stan_Lee|Stan_Lee|  and artist/co-writer  |Jack_Kirby|Jack_Kirby| , Professor X first appeared in  X-Men  1 .       Stan Lee has stated that the physical inspiration of Professor Xavier was from Academy Award–winning actor  |Yul_Brynner|Yul_Brynner| .    Professor Xaviers character development has been inspired by  |Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.|Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.|       Writer  |Scott_Lobdell|Scott_Lobdell|  established Xaviers middle name to be Francis in Uncanny X-Men 328 .       Xaviers goals are to promote the peaceful affirmation of mutant rights, to mediate the co-existence of mutants and humans, to protect mutants from violent humans, and to protect society from antagonistic mutants, including his old friend,  |Magneto|Magneto| . To achieve these aims, he founded Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters  to teach mutants to explore and control their powers. Its first group of students was the original X-Men . Xaviers students consider him a visionary and often refer to their mission as Xaviers dream . He is highly regarded by others in the  |Marvel_Universe|Marvel_Universe| , respected by various governments, and trusted by several other superhero teams, including the  |Avengers|Avengers|  and the  |Fantastic_Four|Fantastic_Four| . However, he also has a manipulative streak which has resulted in several significant fallings-out with allies and students.     He often acts as a public advocate for mutant rights and is the authority most of the Marvel superhero community turns to for advice on mutants. Despite this, his status as a mutant himself and originator of the X-Men only became public during the  |2001|2001_In_Comics|  story  |E_Is_for_Extinction|E_Is_For_Extinction|  . He also appears in almost all of the X-Men animated series and in many video games, although usually as a  |non-playable_character|Non-Playable_Character|  because of his disability.  |Patrick_Stewart|Patrick_Stewart|  plays him in the 2000s  |film_series|X-Men| , as well as providing his voice in some of the X-Men video games .        According to  BusinessWeek , Charles Xavier is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.      In a number of comics, Xavier is shown to have a dark side, a part of himself that he struggles to suppress. Perhaps the most notable appearance of this character element is in the  |Onslaught|Onslaught|  storyline, in which the  |crossover|Crossover|  events antagonist is a physical manifestation of that dark side. Also, Onslaught is created in the most violent act Xavier claims to have done: erasing the mind of Magneto. In X-Men 106 , the new X-Men fight images of the original team, which have been created by what Xavier says is his evil self ... who would use his powers for personal gain and conquest , which he says he is normally able to keep in check. In the 1984 four-part series titled The X-Men and the Micronauts, Xaviers dark desires manifest themselves as the Entity and threaten to destroy the Micronauts universe.     In other instances, Xavier is shown to be secretive and manipulative. During the  |Onslaught|Onslaught|  storyline, the X-Men find Xaviers files, the  |Xavier_Protocols|Xavier_Protocols|  , which detail how to kill many of the characters, including Xavier himself, should the need ever arise, such as if they went rogue.   Astonishing X-Men  vol. 3, 12 reveals that when Xavier realizes that the  |Danger_Room|Danger_Room|  has become sentient, he keeps it trapped and experiments on it for years, an act that Cyclops calls the oppression of a new life and equates to humanitys treatment of mutants .          Charles Francis Xavier was born in  |New_York_City|New_York_City|  to the wealthy Dr. Brian Xavier, a well-respected  |nuclear|Atomic_Nucleus|  scientist, and Sharon Xavier. The family lives in a very grand mansion estate in  |Westchester_County|Westchester_County|  because of the riches his fathers nuclear research has brought them. He later grows up to attend  |Oxford_University|Oxford_University| , where he earns a Professorship in Genetics and other science fields, and goes on to live in first Oxford and then  |London|London|  for a number of years. Crucially, as he enters late adolescence, Xavier inherits the mansion-house he was raised in, enabling him not only to continue to live in it, but also to turn it in to Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters, which he begins together with the first of the  |X-Men|X-Men| .     Brian, his father, dies in an accident when Xavier is still very young, and Brians science partner Kurt Marko comforts and then marries the grieving Sharon. When Xaviers telepathic mutant powers emerge, he discovers Marko cares only about his mothers money. X-Men 12        After the wedding, Kurt moves in with the Xaviers, bringing with him his son  |Cain|Juggernaut| . Kurt quickly grows neglectful of Sharon, driving her to alcoholism, and abuses both Charles and Cain. Cain takes out his frustrations and insecurities on his stepbrother. Charles uses his telepathic powers to read Cains mind and explore the extent of his psychological damage, which only leads to Cain becoming more aggressive toward him and the young Xavier feeling Cains pain firsthand. X-Men 12     Sharon dies soon after, and a fight erupts between Cain and Charles that causes some of Kurts lab equipment to explode. Mortally wounded, Kurt drags the two children out before dying, and admits he was partly responsible for Brians death. X-Men 12 X-Men 38-42     With help from his superhuman powers and natural genius, Xavier becomes an excellent student and athlete, though he gives up the latter, believing his powers give him an unfair advantage. Due to his powers, by the time he graduates from high school, Charles loses all of his hair. He graduates with  |honors|Latin_Honors|  at the age of 16 from  |Bard_College|Bard_College| . In graduate studies, he receives  |Ph.D.s|Doctor_Of_Philosophy|  in  |Genetics|Genetics| ,  |Biophysics|Biophysics| ,  |Psychology|Psychology| , and  |Anthropology|Anthropology|  with a two-year residence at  |Pembroke_College|Pembroke_College,_Oxford| ,  |Oxford_University|Oxford_University| .  He also receives an  |M.D.|Doctor_Of_Medicine|  in  |Psychiatry|Psychiatry|  while spending several years in  |London|London,_England| .

Uncanny X-Men 192-193 Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men 1 presents a different version of events, suggesting a scholarship to Oxford University rescued him from his abusive home, after which he never looked back , suggesting he began his academic career as a very young man at Oxford. Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men 1. 2010. His stepbrother is resentful of him.     At  |graduate_school|Graduate_School| , he meets a  |Scottish|Scotland|  girl named  |Moira_Kinross|Moira_Mactaggert| , a fellow genetics student with whom he falls in love. The two agree to get married, but soon, Xavier is drafted into the  |Korean_War|Korean_War| .

During the war, he receives a letter from Moira telling him that she is breaking up with him. He later discovers that Moira married her old boyfriend Joseph MacTaggert, who abuses her. Uncanny X-Men 389     Deeply depressed when Moira broke off their engagement without explanation, Xavier began traveling around the world as an adventurer after leaving the army. In  |Cairo|Cairo| , he meets a young girl named  |Ororo_Munroe|Storm|  , who is a pickpocket, and the  |Shadow_King|Shadow_King| , a powerful mutant who is posing as Egyptian crime lord Amahl Farouk. Xavier defeats the Shadow King, barely escaping with his life. This encounter leads to Xaviers decision to devote his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent mutants from human oppression.        Xavier visits his friend Daniel Shomron, who runs a clinic for traumatized  |Holocaust|The_Holocaust|  victims in  |Haifa|Haifa| ,  |Israel|Israel| . There, he meets a man going by the name of Magnus , a Holocaust survivor who works as a volunteer in the clinic, and  |Gabrielle_Haller|Gabrielle_Haller| , a woman driven into a catatonic coma by the trauma she experienced. Xavier uses his mental powers to break her out of her catatonia and the two fall in love. Xavier and Magneto become good friends, although neither immediately reveals to the other that he is a mutant. The two hold lengthy debates hypothesizing what will happen if humanity is faced with a new super-powered race of humans. While Xavier is optimistic, Magnetos experiences in the Holocaust lead him to believe that humanity will ultimately oppress the new race of humans as they have done with other minorities. The two friends reveal their powers to each other when they fight Nazi  |Baron_Wolfgang_von_Strucker|Baron_Strucker|  and his  |Hydra|Hydra|  agents, who kidnap Gabrielle because she knows the location of their secret cache of gold. Magneto attempts to kill Strucker but Xavier stops him. Realizing that his and Xaviers views on mutant-human relations are incompatible, Magneto leaves with the gold. Charles stays in Israel for some time, but he and Gabrielle separate on good terms, neither knowing that she is pregnant with his son, who grows up to become the mutant  |Legion|Legion| . Uncanny X-Men 161, 321     In a strange town near the Himalayas, Xavier encounters an alien calling himself  |Lucifer|Lucifer| , the advance scout for an invasion by his race, and foils his plans. In retaliation, Lucifer drops a huge stone block on Xavier, crippling his legs. X-Men 20 After Lucifer leaves, a young woman named  |Sage|Sage|  hears Xaviers telepathic cries for help and rescues him, bringing him to safety, beginning a long alliance between the two. X-Treme X-Men 44     In a hospital in India, he is brought to an American nurse,  |Amelia_Voght|Amelia_Voght| , who looks after him and, as she sees to his recovery, they fall in love. When he is released from the hospital, the two moved into an apartment in  |Bombay|Mumbai|  together. Amelia is troubled to find Charles studying mutation, as she is a mutant and unsettled by it, though she calms when he reveals himself to be a mutant as well. They eventually move to the United States, living on Xaviers family estate. But the night  |Scott_Summers|Cyclops|  moves into Xaviers mansion, Amelia leaves him, believing Charles would have changed his view and that mutants should lie low. Yet he is recruiting them to what she believes is a lost cause. Charles tries to force her to stay with his mental powers, but immediately ashamed by this, lets her go. She later becomes a disciple of Magneto. X-Men 39-42 Uncanny X-Men 309 X-Men vol. 2 25     Over the years, Charles makes a name for himself as  |geneticist|Geneticist|  and psychologist, apparently renowned enough that the Greys were referred to him when no other expert could help their  |catatonic|Catatonic|  daughter,  |Jean|Jean_Grey| . Xavier trains her in the use of her  |telekinesis|Telekinesis| , while inhibiting her  |telepathic|Telepathy|  abilities until she matures.

X-Men 38 With his inherited fortune, he uses his  |ancestral_mansion|X-Mansion|  at 1407 Graymalkin Lane in  |Salem_Center|North_Salem,_New_Yorkcommunities_And_Locations_In_North_Salem| ,  |Westchester_County|Westchester_County| ,  |New_York|New_York|  as a base of operations with technologically advanced facilities, including the  |Danger_Room|Danger_Room|  - later,  |Fantomex|Fantomex|  mentions that Xavier is a billionaire with a net worth of $3.5 billion. New X-Men 129 Presenting the image of a stern teacher, Xavier makes his students endure a rigorous training regime.

X-Men 46, 56, 53 After he completes recruiting the original team of X-Men, he sends them into battle with Magneto. X-Men1     Throughout most of his time with the team, Xavier uses his telepathic powers to keep in constant contact with his students and provides instructions and advice when needed. In addition, he uses a special machine called  |Cerebro|Cerebro| , which enhances his ability to detect mutants and to allow the team to find new students in need of the school. X-Men 1-7, 11     Among the obstacles Xavier faces is his old friend, Magneto, who has grown into an advocate of mutant superiority since their last encounter and who believes the only solution to mutant persecution is domination over humanity.

The X-Men dispatch them, but Trask sees the error in his ways too late as he is killed by his creations. X-Men 14-16     At one point, Xavier seemingly dies during the X-Mens battle with the sub-human  |Grotesk|Grotesk| , but it is later revealed that Xavier arranged for a reformed former villain named  |Changeling|Changeling|  to impersonate him while he went into hiding to plan a defense against an invasion by the extraterrestrial ZNox, imparting a portion of his telepathic abilities to the Changeling to complete the disguise.

This new team, composed of students of  |Dr._Moira_MacTaggert|Moira_Mactaggert| , was sent to rescue the original X-Men from Krakoa. However, after rescuing Cyclops, McTaggerts former students were seemingly killed.

Xavier reaches out to his stepbrother and offers him a place in his mansion, with Cain reluctantly accepting. The Juggernaut redeems himself over the next few weeks and joins the X-Men. Xavier finds out that Cains father preferred him to his own flesh and blood and that they both thought they deserved the abuse they incurred by Kurt; Cain believed this because his father loved someone elses child more than him, and Charles felt guilty about getting in the way. That it is why neither of them stopped Kurt Marko with their powers. Uncanny X-Men 411-412, 429     Now outed as a mutant, Xavier makes speeches to the public about mutant tolerance. He also founds the X-Corporation, or X-Corp , with offices all over the world. The purpose of the X-Corp is to watch over mutant rights and help mutants in need. As a result of being out, the school no longer hides the fact that it is a school for mutants and it opens its doors for more mutant students to come in. A student named  |Quentin_Quire|Quentin_Quire|  and members of his gang start a riot at the Xavier Institute during an open house at the school. As a result, Quire and two other students are killed. Uncertain about his dreams validity, Xavier announces that he will step down as headmaster and be succeeded by Jean Grey. Afterwards, Xorn reveals himself to be Magneto, having apparently not died in the Sentinel raid on Genosha. Magneto undoes the restoration of Xaviers ability to walk, kidnaps him, and destroys the X-Mansion . Then Xorn/Magneto assaults New York, where Cyclops, Fantomex and a few students confront him. After the rest of the X-Men arrive, Xorn/Magneto kills Jean Grey with an electromagnetically induced stroke, and Wolverine decapitates him. With Jean dead, Xavier leaves the school to Cyclops and Emma Frost, to bury Xorn/Magneto in Genosha.

Excalibur vol. 2 1-8     At the mansion, the Danger Room  gains  |sentience|Sentience| , christens itself Danger , assumes a humanoid form, and attacks the X-Men before leaving to kill Xavier. With Magnetos help, Xavier holds off Danger until the X-Men arrive. Danger flees, but not before revealing to Colossus that Xavier has known it to be sentient ever since he upgraded it. Colossus is especially offended by this because he had been held captive and experimented upon by Dangers ally,  |Ord|Ord|  of the Breakworld. Ashamed, Xavier tries to explain to them that by the time he realized what was happening, he could see no other course. The disgusted X-Men leave. Excalibur vol. 2 9-10 New X-Men 155-156 Astonishing X-Men vol. 3 7, 9-12     In a prelude to  House of M , Magnetos daughter  |Scarlet_Witch|Scarlet_Witch|  suffers a mental breakdown and  |causes_the_death_of_several_Avengers|Avengers_Disassembled| .

Xavier orders a meeting of the X-Men and Avengers to decide Wandas fate.  House of M   |limited_series|Limited_Series|  Her brother  |Quicksilver|Quicksilver| , believing the heroes plan to kill her, speeds off to Genosha and convinces Wanda that she could right the wrongs she inflicted by using her powers to alter reality.     Quicksilver somehow forces a tearful Wanda to reveal to him her hearts desires of Magneto, the assembled New Avengers, and the X-Men, and then uses her powers to make them all real. Thanks to Magneto, though, this re-imagined world is a place where a much more numerous mutant-kind are the dominant species, humans a disenfranchised and oppressed silent majority, and Magneto himself rules supreme. In this reality, the only proof that Charles Xavier ever existed is a secret monument in Magnetos palace garden, with the engraved message He died so Genosha could live .     After mutant  |Layla_Miller|Layla_Miller|  restores the memories of some of the X-Men and Avengers, they head to Genosha where they discover that Magneto has erected a memorial garden for Xavier commemorating his death. Emma is horrified until  |Cloak|Cloak_And_Dagger|  fades into the grave and discovers there is no body inside. After a battle, Scarlet Witch again uses her powers to restore reality and, as a slight against her father, causes a large majority mutants to  |lose_their_powers|Decimation| , leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction and causing the lost powers to become an energy mass,  |the_Collective|The_Collective| . With reality restored, Xavier is still missing and the X-Men are unable to detect him with Cerebro House of M 1-8 .     Xavier returns when Cyclops and Havoks long-lost brother,  |Vulcan|Vulcan| , is revived by the Collective energy released as a result of the House of M incident. Vulcan then attacks the X-Men. Xavier, now depowered but able to walk in the wake of House of M , reveals that he had gathered and trained another team of X-Men  sometime between the original team and the new X-Men team introduced in Giant Size X-Men 1. This team included Vulcan as a member. Like the Giant Size X-Men team, McTaggerts former students were sent to rescue the original X-Men from Krakoa, the living island. However, after rescuing Cyclops, McTaggerts former students were seemingly killed. Upon Cyclops return, Xavier removed Cyclops memories of the death of Vulcan and his teammates and began assembling the Giant Size X-Men. Vulcan skirmishes with the X-Men and eventually flees into space.     In spite of Cyclops feelings, Xavier forms a new team including  |Havok|Havok|  and  |Darwin|Darwin| , the lone other survivors of Moiras students. Uncanny X-Men 475 Xavier seeks to confront Vulcan before he can enact his vengeance against the Shiar empire, which killed Vulcans mother. While en route to the Shiar homeworld, Xavier is abducted and is later thrown into the  |MKraan_Crystal|Mkraan_Crystal|  by Vulcan. Darwin follows Xavier into the crystal and pulls Xavier out. This somehow restores Xaviers lost telepathy. With help from his longtime lover, Lilandra, Xavier escapes back to Earth with several of his X-Men.     Upon Xaviers return to Earth, as seen in the  World War Hulk  storyline, he begins to search for lost mutants such as Magneto. Charles search for more mutants is interrupted by the  |Hulk|Hulk| , who was sent into extraterrestrial exile by  |the_Illuminati|Illuminati| , a group of powerful superbeings to which Xavier belongs. Xavier had no part in the Hulk exile decision, but Xavier admits to Hulk that he would have concurred to a temporary exile so  |Bruce_Banner|Hulk|  could be cured of transforming into the Hulk. However, he also tells the Hulk he would not have agreed to permanent exile. Xavier attempts to surrender to the Hulk, but after viewing the X-Mansions large graveyard dedicated to post-M-Day mutant deaths, The Hulk concludes the mutants have suffered enough and leaves the Mansion grounds on his own accord. While the X-Men tend to the wounded, Cyclops finally forgives Professor X.     While using  |Cerebra|Cerebra|  and talking to Beast during the  Messiah Complex  storyline, Charles detects a new mutant so powerful it fries Cerebras system. He asks Cyclops to send out a team to find out about the mutant. Once the team has come back empty handed, he argues with Scott for not telling him about the team he deployed to find former Acolytes. Scott tells him outright that he doesnt need him to run the X-Men anymore. X-Factor v2 26 This upsets Charles and annoys him later on when he overhears Cyclops briefing X-Factor on the situation. He also approaches the  |New_X-Men|New_X-Men|  in an attempt to help them figure out a non-violent way to help against the Purifiers, but is quickly rebuked by  |Surge|Surge| , who questions where he was when they were getting attacked the first time, and that they didnt need to learn from him. Charles questions Cyclops decision to send X-Force to hunt down his own son, Cable, in front of the students. Cyclops then tells Xavier that he is a distraction that will keep getting in the way and that he must leave the mansion. Xavier is contacted by  |Cable|Cable| , who lost the mutant newborn to the traitorous actions of  |Bishop|Bishop| , who in turn lost the child to the  |Marauders|Marauders| , and tells him that he is the only one who can help Cable save the future. Uncanny X-Men 494 In the final fight, Xavier is accidentally shot in the head by Bishop. Immediately afterward Xaviers body disappears and Cyclops declares that there are no more X-Men. X-Men 207 - Messiah Complex     Professor Xavier survives Bishops gunshot but falls into a coma. X-Men Legacy 208 Xavier is kidnapped by Exodus, Tempo, and  |Karima_Shapandar|Karima_Shapandar| . Exodus tries to heal Xavier, Xavier mentally fights Exodus. Exodus finally approaches Magneto, who is apparently still depowered, for help. Magneto and Karima Shapandar are able to stir Xaviers memories and coax him out of his coma, though Xavier remains slightly confused and partly amnesiac. Later, Exodus confronts Magneto about  |Joanna_Cargills|Joanna_Cargill|  injury . Exodus nearly kills Magneto, and Xavier drags Exodus onto the Astral Plane, putting Xaviers own newly restored mind at stake. Xavier defeats Exodus after a harrowing psionic battle, and Exodus reveals the reason he abducted Xavier and to restore his mind: Exodus wants Xavier to lead the Acolytes and find the mutant messiah child in order to indoctrinate the child into their cause. Xavier refuses.  |Emma_Frosts|Emma_Frost|  telepathy picks up on the psychic fight, and Emma informs Cyclops that Xavier is alive. Xavier parts company with Magneto and Karima to try to regain his lost memories by visiting people from his past. X-Men Legacy 210     The first person Charles visits is Carter Ryking, who had gone insane after losing his powers. Charles reads Carters memories and discovers that when the two were children they were used as test subjects by  |Nathan_Milbury|Mister_Sinister|  of the Black Womb Project, with the approval of Charles father, Doctor Brian Xavier. Xavier makes the connection Milbury and X-Men villain,  |Mister_Sinister|Mister_Sinister| , who has apparently long been manipulating Charles life in addition to other X-Men. Afterwards, he discovers he has been targeted by assassins. X-Men Legacy 211     Charles eventually discovers Mister Sinister had set up Charles, Sebastian Shaw, Juggernaut, and Ryking as potential new hosts for Sinisters mind. Bleeding slowly to death, he apparently gives in to Sinister becoming the new Mister Sinister. But in reality, Xavier is still battling Sinister for control of his body. As Sebastian Shaw and Gambit destroy Sinisters Cronus Machine, the device that he used to transfer his consciousness into new hosts, Xavier drives Sinister out of his body permanently. Xavier thanks Shaw and Gambit for their help and declares he must go and see Cyclops immediately. X-Men Legacy 214 Professor X returns to the X-Mansion to find it destroyed after recent events. Afterwards, Xavier leaves the ruins of the X-Mansion to secretly meet up Cyclops by psychically coercing his former student for the visit. Xavier explains to Cyclops about the recent events with Mr. Sinister and tries to explain to Cyclops how Sinister has been manipulating Scotts and Jeans lives since when they were children. Xavier attempts to have Scott give him permission to scan Scotts mind for traces of Sinisters influences, but instead, Scott turns the tables on Xavier by revealing that he has secretly invited Emma Frost into their entire meeting and also into Xaviers mind. X-Men Legacy 215     While in his mind, Emma forces Xavier to relive each of his morally ambiguous decisions under altruistic pretenses. As the issue continues, Charles realizes his human arrogance and that while some of his decisions were morally wrong, he must move forward with his life and deal with the consequences. Emma ends her incursion into Xaviers mind by reminding him of Moira MacTaggerts last words. As he reflects on Moiras words, Xavier gives Cyclops his blessing to lead the X-Men and leaves to find his own path. X-Men Legacy 216 Following his encounter with Wolverine Professor Xavier seeks out his step-brother, the unstoppable Juggernaut in an attempt to reform him. After a conversation about the meaning of the word Juggernaut and a review of Juggernaut and Xaviers shared history Xavier offers Cain an empty box as a gift. Confused by Xaviers gift Cain attempts to kill the Professor bringing an entire sports bar down over their heads in the process. Later Cain battles the X-Men in his full Juggernaut armor and conquers the planet. Just as everything appears to be under the Juggernauts control Xavier reappears and informs him that everything that has just taken place except for Juggernaut destroying the bar took place in Cains mind. A baffled Cain demands to know how Xavier managed to overcome his psychically shielded helmet to which the Professor replies that he decided to visit Cain in his sleep. Professor Xavier then informs him that he now understands Cain as a person and that he will not attempt to get in his way or reform him again. But Xavier also warns Cain that if he gets in the way of the Professors path to redemption Xavier will stop him permanently. X-Men: Legacy 219 Following his encounter with Cain it has been revealed that Xavier is now searching for Rogue. X-Men Legacy 220     After his bruising encounter with Cyclops and Emma Frost, Professor X is forced to revisit the biggest challenge and the biggest failure of his career, Wolverine, when the feral mutant asks for Charles help in freeing his son from the clutches of the Hellfire Club. As the two search for Daken, Wolverine reveals that when he first joined the X-Men he attempted to assassinate Xavier due to some unknown programming. In response, the Professor broke Logans mind and rebuilt it so that any and all programming he received was forgotten. Logan also revealed that the real reason Xavier asked him to join the X-Men was that Charles needed a weapon . X-Men Legacy 217 Eventually Professor Xavier and Wolverine locate Sebastian Shaws mansion and attack his minions, just as they are about to enter a bomb explodes from within catching them both off guard. From the wreckage emerges an angry Sebastian who immobilizes Wolverine. Meanwhile, Miss Sinister knocks  |Daken|Daken|  unconscious and has him taken to the med lab in the mansions basement. As Shaw prepares to deliver a killing blow to Xavier, Wolverine recovers and stops him telling Xavier to rescue his son. Professor Xavier locates the med lab and after a quick psychic battle with Miss Sinister enters Dakens fractured mind. While in Dakens mind Xavier discovers Romuluss psychic tampering and comments that Dakens mind is even more broken than Wolverines was. Before Xavier can heal Daken a psychic bomb explodes causing Xavier to become comatose and Daken to wake up. Miss Sinister arrives and attempts to manipulate Daken who reveals that the psychic bomb in his head restored his memories and stabs Miss Sinister in the chest. Meanwhile, Wolverine defeats Shaw and enters the mansion to find Daken standing over an unconscious Xavier preparing to kill him. X-Men Legacy 218 Wolverine tells Daken that he wont let him hurt Xavier and the two fight. Overcome with guilt over what happened to Daken and Itsu, Wolverine allows himself to be beaten. Just as Daken appears to have won Xavier pulls both of them onto the astral plane revealing that the psychic bomb had little effect on him because his psyche was already shattered. Xavier then explains to Wolverine and Daken that Romulus is solely responsible for Itsus death and that he lied to Daken about everything because he wanted Wolverine to become his weapon. As the three converse, Daken returns to the physical plane and prevents Shaw from killing Xavier. With the truth revealed Wolverine and Daken decide to kill Romulus. As the two depart Wolverine tells Xavier that he forgives him for all of the dark moments in their history. Wolverine acknowledges that Professor Xavier allowed him to become a hero. Wolverine then tells the Professor that he hopes he will one day be able to forgive him for choosing to kill Romulus.

In a prelude to the  |Secret_Invasion|Secret_Invasion|  storyline, Professor X was at the meeting of the Illuminati when it came to the discussion about the Skrulls planning an invasion by taking out Earths heroes and posing as them. He claims he was unable to distinguish that  |Black_Bolt|Black_Bolt|  had been replaced by a  |Skrull|Skrull| , and his powers were tested quickly by the Black Bolt Skrull. Professor X leaves after learning even he can no longer trust the others, yet appears to have severely restricted the number of people he informs of the forthcoming alien invasion, as the X-Men were not prepared for the Skrulls, at least at first.

Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus. Marvel Comics.     After the events of Utopia, Xavier has come to live on the risen Asteroid M, rechristened Utopia, along with the rest of the X-Men, X-Club, and mutant refugees and is also allowed to join the Utopia lead council . While he no longer continues to openly question every move that Cyclops makes, he is still concerned about some of his leadership decisions. Xavier had wanted to return to the mainland in order to clear his name, but in the aftermath of Osborn declaring Utopia as a mutant detention area, Cyclops refused to let him leave, stating that it would be a tactical advantage to have him as an ace in the hole in case the need arose. To that end, he has kept Xavier out of the field and instead relied on Emma Frost, Psylocke and the Stepford Cuckoos respectively for their own psionic talents. Uncanny X-Men 515. Marvel Comics.

Uncanny Avengers 24 During a fight with the Stark Sentinels, Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch attempt to cast a spell to invert the axis of Red Skulls brain and bring out the fragment of Professor X to defeat Onslaught. Doctor Strange was targeted and captured by the Sentinels before they could cast the spell. Avengers & X-Men: AXIS 2 When Magneto arrived with his supervillain allies, Doctor Doom and Scarlet Witch attempted to cast the inversion spell again and Red Onslaught was knocked unconscious and reverted to his Red Skull form. Although they did not know whether Professor X was now in control, the Avengers decided to be cautious and take Red Skull to Stark Tower. It was later revealed that the spell had actually caused all the heroes and villains present to undergo a moral inversion rather than simply bringing out Professor X in the Skull, with the result that the Skull and other villains became heroic while the Avengers and X-Men present became villainous. Avengers & X-Men: AXIS 3 Eventually, the inversion was undone. Avengers & X-Men: AXIS 9     After the Skull mounts a telepathic assault that nearly allows him to take control of the Avengers, he is defeated when Deadpool places Magnetos old helmet on Rogue, allowing her to knock out the Skull and take him to Beast.

Uncanny Avengers vol. 2 22     The astral form of Professor Xavier has since been revealed to be imprisoned in the Astral Plane after Shadow King somehow acquired it upon Professor Xs death. Astonishing X-Men 01 After what appeared to be years in the Astral Plane, Professor X is able to trick Shadow King into playing him in a game that lures Rogue, Mystique and Fantomex onto the Astral Plane, Astonishing X-Men Vol. 4 5 while turning others into carriers for the Shadow Kings contagious psychic essence. With the Shadow King certain of his victory, he fails to realize that Xaviers apparent surrender to his game was really just him biding his time until the Shadow Kings influence was distracted long enough for him to drop his already-subtly-weakened guard long enough for Xavier to break his bonds, luring in the three aforementioned X-Men as their identities were already fundamentally malleable. With the Shadow King defeated, Xavier is apparently returned to the real world in the body of Fantomex, Fantomex reasoning that nobody really knows who he is as an individual beyond his status as one of the X-Men whereas this act of sacrifice will ensure that he is remembered for a great deed. Astonishing X-Men Vol. 4 6     Proteus has spent years trapped in a psionic hellscape of the Astral Plane, where The Shadow King reigned supreme, only to escape last issue. Part of the reason that he could was the escape of Charles Xavier , and now X leads the X-Men directly into an ambush, as Proteus has warped an entire village with his powers, leading to a mind-to-mind battle that leaves X on the receiving end of a psychic beatdown. Astonishing X-Men Vol. 4 10     Proteus has started his garden and his seeds are planted all over the world. Psylocke is in command and has a plan which mainly consists of Archangel using metal and Mystique morphing into his mother. Once they drain him, Rogue and Bishop convert his energy and release him back to the universe. Whilst this all went down Psylocke and X combined forces to burn out the seeds across the planet. As they are working on it they discover they are not enough to accomplish the task. X mentions the network of psychics the Shadow King was using and that Betsy who is in control should tap into it. She agrees and does so yet unbeknownst to her X was possessed by the Shadow King who violently erupts from Xs head. Astonishing X-Men Vol. 4 11     Following X’s apparent death after the Shadow King exploded from his skull, the psychic villain tears the X-Men apart until X literally pulls himself back together , and he and Psylocke team up to harness the power of all of Earth’s psychics to destroy the Shadow King. As Psylocke says she feels no psychic trace of him anywhere, X implants comforting post-hypnotic psychic suggestions in his allies and then erases their memories . Only Psylocke’s memory is left intact, with X telling her she’ll be the one to “keep him honest” while he embarks on a new mission. Astonishing X-Men Vol. 4 12     X has since made his presence known to his former students and reveals his new plan for all mutantkind. Now clad in a Cerebro-like helmet, Xavier has apparently abandoned his dream for peaceful coexistence, and had turned Krakoa into a sovereign nation state for mutants as well as use it to apparently heal the X-Men from their ordeals during the showdown against the forces of O.N.E. He then leads the X-Men into planting in seeds in strategic locations around the world and Mars, which, overnight, grow into massive plantlike Habitats . As it turns out, these Habitats – and the plants that grew them – are extensions of Krakoa. Through the advancement of mutant technology combined with Krakoas unique abilities as a living mutant island, Professor X and the X-Men have embassies around the world. Also through this combination of technology and mutant power, Xavier have developed three drugs that could change human life – a pill that extends human life by five years, an adaptable universal antibiotic, and a pill that cures diseases of the mind, in humans .” In exchange for recognizing the sovereignty of Krakoa, Professor X will give these drugs to mankind, with mutants living in peace on the island. House of X 1     Xavier and Magneto later meets with Raven Darkholm inside his sanctum. The two mutant leaders both greatly pleased with the success of her mission as she presents what theyed petitioned her to steal. A mysterious USB tab containing sensitive information stolen from  |Damage_Control|Damage_Control| , House of X 1 Mystique would inquire for her payment as shed met their demands. However, Xavier mentions that he still had more demands that needed to met as they were building their protected future of Homo Sapiens Superior, seeming to psychokinetically beckon the contents of her theft into his hands while Mystique questions how much more needed to be done for his ultimate pet project. Powers of X 1     Xavier and Magneto reveal the contents of the USB drive to Cyclops, which are shown to be information on Orchis, an organization dedicated to responding to a large-scale mutant threat and the plans of a Mother Mold. They believe that the creation of the Mother Mold will herald a new generation of Sentinels and along with it, Nimrod. They task Cyclops with assembling a team to destroy the Mother Mold station. Although the team is successfully, they are all killed in the process. X mourns them, vowing No more. Powers of X 1     Xavier is revealed to have upgraded Cerebro with the help of Forge, which is now able to copy and store the minds of mutants in a database. After the Five are able to grow the bodies of deceased mutants, Xavier is able to copy the minds back in these empty shells. Thus, he is able to resurrect Cyclopss team, thanking them for what they did. At the U.N., Xavier, Beast, and Emma celebrate with other ambassadors for the recognition of Krakoa as a sovereign nation. Xavier telepathically converses with Emma, revealing that he knows that she manipulated the Russian ambassador to abstain from the vote, before thanking her for her service. Two days after the U.N. vote, Xavier, Magneto, and Wolverine are in Krakoa waiting besides several portals. While Wolverine expresses his misgivings about the upcoming event, Xavier and Magneto assure him all will be alright. Soon after, several villainous mutants, including Mister Sinister, Sebastian Shaw, Exodus, Selene and Apocalypse arrive through the portals. Apocalypse in particular expresses satisfaction at arriving and Krakoa responds in the same way. Magneto and Xavier reveal that they have invited all mutants, even those who have fought against them in the past, to Krakoa, to form a society. The assembled villainous mutants agree to their terms, and Xavier shakes Apocalypses hand, welcoming him and the others to their home. Powers of X 5          Professor X is a  |mutant|Mutant|  who possesses vast telepathic powers, and is among the strongest and most powerful telepaths in the  |Marvel_Universe|Marvel_Universe| . He is able to perceive the thoughts of others or project his own thoughts within a radius of approximately . Xaviers telepathy once covered the entire world; although following this, Magneto altered the Earths electromagnetic field to restrict Xaviers telepathic range. Uncanny X-Men 145 While not on Earth, Xaviers natural telepathic abilities have reached across space to make universal mental contact with multiple alien races. Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet With extreme effort, he can also greatly extend the range of his telepathy. He can learn foreign languages by reading the language centers of the brain of someone adept, and alternately teach languages to others in the same manner. Xavier once trained a new group of mutants mentally, subjectively making them experience months of training together, while only hours passed in the real world. X-Men: Deadly Genesis     Xaviers vast psionic powers enable him to manipulate the minds of others, warp perceptions to make himself seem invisible, project mental illusions, cause loss of particular memories or total amnesia, and induce pain or temporary mental and/or physical paralysis in others. Within close range, he can manipulate almost any number of minds for such simple feats. However, he can only take full possession of one other mind at a time, and must strictly be within that persons physical presence. He is one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals and even share their perceptions. X-Men Legacy 211 He can also telepathically take away or control peoples natural bodily functions and senses, such as sight, hearing, smell, taste, or even mutant powers. A side effect of his telepathy is that he has an  |eidetic_memory|Eidetic_Memory|  and his brain can assimilate and process impossibly huge amounts of raw data in an astonishingly short amount of time. Uncanny X-Men 298 He has displayed telepathic prowess sufficient to confront  |Ego_the_Living_Planet|Ego_The_Living_Planet|   Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet as well as narrowly defeat  |Exodus|Exodus| .
