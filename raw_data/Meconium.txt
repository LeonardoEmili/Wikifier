     Meconium is the earliest  |stool|Human_Feces|  of a mammalian  |infant|Infant| . Unlike later feces, meconium is composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the  |uterus|Uterus| |epithelial_cells|Epithelial_Cells| ,  |lanugo|Lanugo| ,  |mucus|Mucus| ,  |amniotic_fluid|Amniotic_Fluid| ,  |bile|Bile|  and water. Meconium, unlike later feces, is viscous and sticky like tar, its color usually being a very dark olive green; it is almost odorless. When diluted in amniotic fluid, it may appear in various shades of green, brown, or yellow. It should be completely passed by the end of the first few days after birth, with the stools progressing toward yellow .           Meconium is normally retained in the infants bowel until after birth, but sometimes it is expelled into the  |amniotic_fluid|Amniotic_Fluid|  prior to birth or during  |labor_and_delivery|Childbirth| . The stained amniotic fluid is recognized by medical staff as a possible sign of  |fetal_distress|Fetal_Distress| . Some post-dates pregnancies may also have meconium-stained liquor without fetal distress. Medical staff may aspirate the meconium from the nose and mouth of a newborn immediately after delivery in the event the baby shows signs of respiratory distress to decrease the risk of  |meconium_aspiration_syndrome|Meconium_Aspiration_Syndrome| , which can occur in meconium-stained amniotic fluid.     Most of the time that the amniotic fluid is stained with meconium, it will be homogeneously distributed throughout the fluid, making it brown. This indicates that the fetus passed the meconium some time ago such that sufficient mixing occurred as to establish the homogeneous mixture. Terminal meconium occurs when the fetus passes the meconium a short enough time before birth/cesarean section that the amniotic fluid remains clear, but individual clumps of meconium are in the fluid.       The failure to pass meconium is a symptom of several diseases including  |Hirschsprungs_disease|Hirschsprungs_Disease|  and  |cystic_fibrosis|Cystic_Fibrosis| .     The meconium sometimes becomes thickened and congested in the  |intestines|Intestines| , a condition known as meconium ileus. Meconium ileus is often the first sign of  |cystic_fibrosis|Cystic_Fibrosis| .  In cystic fibrosis, the meconium can form a bituminous black-green mechanical obstruction in a segment of the ileum. Beyond this, there may be a few separate grey-white globular pellets. Below this level, the bowel is a narrow and empty micro-colon. Above the level of the obstruction, there are several loops of hypertrophied bowel distended with fluid. No meconium is passed, and abdominal distension and vomiting appear soon after birth. About 20% of cases of cystic fibrosis present with meconium ileus, while approximately 20% of one series of cases of meconium ileus did not have cystic fibrosis.  The presence of meconium ileus is not related to the severity of the cystic fibrosis.  The obstruction can be relieved in a number of different ways.      Meconium ileus should be distinguished from meconium plug syndrome, in which a tenacious mass of mucus prevents the meconium from passing and there is no risk of intestinal perforation. Meconium ileus has a significant risk of intestinal perforation. In a barium enema, meconium plug syndrome shows a normal or dilated colon as compared to micro-colon in meconium ileus.       Meconium can be tested for various drugs, to check for in utero exposure. Using meconium, a Canadian research group showed that by measuring a by-product of  |alcohol|Ethanol| , fatty acid ethyl esters they could objectively detect excessive maternal drinking of alcohol during pregnancy.

In the USA, the results of meconium testing may be used by  |child_protective_services|Child_Protective_Services|  and other  |law_enforcement_agencies|Law_Enforcement_Agency|  to determine the eligibility of the parents to keep the newborn.

Meconium can also be analyzed to detect the tobacco use of mothers during their pregnancy, which is commonly under-reported.        The issue of whether meconium is sterile remains debated and is an area of ongoing research. Although some researchers have reported evidence of bacteria in meconium,  this has not been consistently confirmed. Other researchers have raised questions about whether these findings may be due to contamination after sample collection and that meconium is, in fact, sterile until after birth.  Further researchers have hypothesized that there may be bacteria in the womb, but these are a normal part of pregnancy and could have an important role in shaping the developing immune system and are not harmful to the baby.        The  |Latin|Latin|  term meconium derives from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  , mēkōnion, a diminutive of , mēkōn, i.e.  |poppy|Poppy| , in reference either to its tar-like appearance that may resemble some raw  |opium|Opium|  preparations or to  |Aristotles|Aristotle|  belief that it induces sleep in the fetus.  .        In biology, meconium describes the  |metabolic|Metabolic|  waste product from the pupal stage of an insect that is expelled through the anal opening of the adult upon  |eclosion|Pupa|  from the  |pupa|Pupa| . Other insects, such as  |beetles|Beetle|  and some  |Hymenoptera|Hymenoptera|   expel the meconium at the end of the larval stage, before becoming a  |pupa|Pupa| .
