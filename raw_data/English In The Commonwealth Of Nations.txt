            The use of the  |English_language|English_Language|  in most  |member_countries|Member_States_Of_The_Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  of the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  was inherited from  |British_colonisation|British_Empire| .  |Mozambique|Mozambique|  is an exception â€“ although English is widely spoken there, it is a former Portuguese colony which joined the Commonwealth in 1996. English is spoken as a first or second language in most of the Commonwealth. In a few countries, such as  |Cyprus|Languages_Of_Cyprus|  and  |Malaysia|Languages_Of_Malaysia| , it does not have  |official_status|Official_Language| , but is widely used as a  |lingua_franca|Lingua_Franca| .     Many regions, notably  |Canada|Canadian_English| ,  |Australia|Australian_English| ,  |India|Indian_English| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand_English| ,  |Pakistan|Pakistani_English| ,  |South_Africa|South_African_English| ,  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong_English| ,  |Malaysia|Malaysian_English| ,  |Brunei|Brunei_English| ,  |Singapore|Singapore_English| ,  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lankan_English|  and the  |Caribbean|Caribbean_English| , have developed their own native varieties of the language.     Written English as used in the Commonwealth generally favours British spelling as opposed to American, with some exceptions in Canada, where there is a strong influence from neighbouring American English . Few Commonwealth countries besides Canada and Australia have produced their own  |dictionaries|Dictionary|  and  |style_guides|Style_Guide|  from major publishers, and rely on those produced in the United Kingdom, especially for formal writing.     The report of the Inter-Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership states that English is a symbol of Commonwealth heritage and unity.         |Southern_Hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere|  native varieties of English began to develop during the 18th century, with the colonisation of Australasia and South Africa.  |Australian_English|Australian_English|  and  |New_Zealand_English|New_Zealand_English|  are closely related to each other, and share some similarities with  |South_African_English|South_African_English|  . The vocabularies of these dialects draw from both  |British_English|British_English|  and  |American_English|American_English|  , as well as numerous native peculiarities.      |Canadian_English|Canadian_English|  contains elements of British English and American English, as well as many Canadianisms and some French influences. It is the product of several waves of immigration and settlement, from Britain, Ireland, France, the United States, and around the world, over a period of almost two centuries. Modern Canadian English has taken significant vocabulary and spelling from the shared political and social institutions of Commonwealth countries.        |Caribbean_English|Caribbean_English|  is influenced by the English-based  |Creole|Creole_Language|  varieties spoken, but they are not one and the same. There is a great deal of variation in the way English is spoken, with a Standard English at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum and Creole languages at the other. These dialects have roots in 17th-century British and  |Irish_English|Irish_English| , and  |African_languages|African_Language| , plus localised influences from other  |colonial|Colonial_Era|  languages including French, Spanish, and Dutch; unlike most native varieties of English, West Indian dialects often tend to be syllable-timed rather than  |stress-timed|Timing| .         Second-language varieties of English in  |Africa|Africa|  and  |Asia|Asia|  have often undergone indigenisation ; that is, each English-speaking community has developed its own standards of usage, often under the influence of local languages. These dialects are sometimes referred to as New Englishes ; most of them inherited  |non-rhoticity|Rhoticity_In_English|  from Southern British English.       Several dialects of  |West_African_English|West_African_English|  exist, with a lot of regional variation and some influence from indigenous languages. West African English tends to be  |syllable-timed|Isochrony| , and its phoneme inventory is much simpler than that of  |received_pronunciation|Received_Pronunciation| ; this sometimes affects mutual intelligibility with native varieties of English. A distinctive  |East_African_English|East_African_English| , often with significant influences from Bantu languages such as  |Swahili|Swahili_Language| , is spoken in countries such as  |Kenya|Kenya|  or  |Tanzania|Tanzania| , particularly in Nairobi and other cities where there is an expanding middle class, for whom English is increasingly being used in the home as the first language.     Small communities of native English speakers can be found in  |Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe| ,  |Botswana|Botswana| , and  |Namibia|Namibia| ; the dialects spoken are similar to native  |South_African_English|South_African_English| .        |India|India|  has the largest English-speaking population in the Commonwealth, although comparatively few speakers of  |Indian_English|Indian_English|  are first-language speakers. The same is true of English spoken in other parts of South Asia, e.g.  |Pakistani_English|Pakistani_English| , and  |Bangladeshi_English|Bangladeshi_English| .  |South_Asia|South_Asia| n English phonology is highly variable; stress, rhythm and intonation are generally different from those of native varieties. There are also several peculiarities at the levels of morphology, syntax and usage, some of which can also be found among educated speakers.      |Southeast_Asian_English|Southeast_Asian_English|  comprises  |Singapore_English|Singapore_English| ,  |Malaysian_English|Malaysian_English| , and  |Brunei_English|Brunei_English| ; it features some influence from  |Malay|Malay_Language|  and  |Chinese|Chinese_Language|  languages, as well as  |Indian_English|Indian_English| .      |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong|  ceased to be part of the Commonwealth in 1997. Nonetheless,  |the_English_language_there|Hong_Kong_English|.
