   A bug in  |poker|Poker|  is a limited form of  |wild_card|Wild_Card| . One or both  |jokers|Joker|  are often added to the deck and played as bugs.     In  |draw_poker|Draw_Poker|  played for high and  |pai_gow_poker|Pai_Gow_Poker| , the bug is considered to be an ace, unless it can be used as a missing card to complete a  |straight|Straight|  or a  |flush|Flush| , in which case it becomes the highest card which can complete the hand.     K-K-Joker-5-2 is a pair of kings with an ace  |kicker|Kicker| .   A-A-Joker-9-4 is three aces.    A♥ J♥ 8♥ 3♥ Joker is a flush, ace-king high, the bug becoming the K♥ , even if another player holds the real K♥ .   7-6-5-4-Joker is an eight-high straight, the bug becoming an eight rather than a three since both complete the straight but the eight is higher.   J♣ 10♣ 8♣ 7♣ Joker is a straight flush, jack high, the bug becoming the 9♣.     In  |California_lowball|Lowball| , the bug is the lowest unpaired card in a hand. For example in 8-6-4-3 plus the bug, the bug becomes an ace; in A-2-3-5 plus the bug, the bug becomes a four.     Holding the bug greatly increases the power of certain drawing hands. For example, playing for high, a natural four-straight such as Q-J-10-9 drawing one has nine  |outs|Out|  to complete the hand, any king or eight or the bug. By contrast a four-straight including the bug can have as many as sixteen outs to complete the straight - Q-J-10-Joker can catch any ace, king, nine, or eight.
