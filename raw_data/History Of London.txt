   The history of  |London|London| , the capital city of  |England|England|  and the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , extends over 2000 years. In that time, it has become one of the worlds most significant financial and cultural capital cities. It has withstood  |plague|Great_Plague_Of_London| , devastating  |fire|Great_Fire_Of_London| ,  |civil_war|English_Civil_War| ,  |aerial_bombardment|The_Blitz| ,  |terrorist_attacks|List_Of_Terrorist_Incidents_In_London| , and  |riots|List_Of_Riots_In_London| .     The  |City_of_London|City_Of_London| , often referred to simply as the City , is the historic core of the  |Greater_London_metropolis|Greater_London_Built-Up_Area| , and is today its primary financial district, though it represents only a small part of the wider metropolis.       According to  Historia Regum Britanniae , by  |Geoffrey_of_Monmouth|Geoffrey_Of_Monmouth| , London was found by  |Brutus_of_Troy|Brutus_Of_Troy|  about 1000–1100  B.C.E. after he defeated the native giant  |Gogmagog|Gogmagog| ; the settlement was known as ,  , which, according to a pseudo-etymology, was corrupted to  Trinovantum .  |Trinovantes|Trinovantes|  were the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  tribe who inhabited the area prior to the Romans. Geoffrey provides prehistoric London with a rich array of legendary kings, such as  |Lud|Lud_Son_Of_Heli|   who, he claims, renamed the town Caer Ludein, from which London was derived, and was buried at  |Ludgate|Ludgate| .     Some recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1993, the remains of a  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  bridge were found on the Thamess south foreshore, upstream of  |Vauxhall_Bridge|Vauxhall_Bridge| .  This bridge either crossed the Thames, or went to a now lost island in the river.  |Dendrology|Dendrology|  dated the timbers to between 1750 B.C.E and 1285 B.C.E. URL:. Accessed: 2018-06-23.  In 2001, a further dig found that the timbers were driven vertically into the ground on the south bank of the  |Thames|Thames|  west of Vauxhall Bridge.  In 2010, the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to between 4,800 B.C.E. and 4,500 B.C.E. Londons Oldest Prehistoric Structure. BAJR. 2018-07-06. URL:. Accessed: 2018-07-06. were found, again on the foreshore south of Vauxhall Bridge.  The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. All these structures are on the south bank at a natural crossing point where the  |River_Effra|River_Effra|  flows into the Thames.     It is thought that the Thames was an important tribal boundary, and numerous finds have been made of  |spear|Spear|  heads and weaponry from the Bronze and Iron Ages near the banks of the Thames in the London area, many of which had clearly been used in battle.       Archaeologist Leslie Wallace notes that Because no  |LPRIA|Prehistoric_Britainlate_Pre-Roman_Iron_Age|  settlements or significant domestic refuse have been found in London, despite extensive archaeological excavation, arguments for a purely Roman foundation of London are now common and uncontroversial.                      Londinium was established as a civilian town by the  |Romans|Roman_Empire|  about four years . Archaeology Data Service, The University of York. after the  |invasion_of_AD_43|Roman_Conquest_Of_Britain| . London, like Rome, was founded on the point of the river where it was narrow enough to bridge and the strategic location of the city provided easy access to much of Europe. Early Roman London occupied a relatively small area, roughly equivalent to the size of  |Hyde_Park|Hyde_Park,_London| . In around AD 60, it was destroyed by the  |Iceni|Iceni|  led by their queen  |Boudica|Boudica| . The city was quickly rebuilt as a planned Roman town and recovered after perhaps 10 years, the city growing rapidly over the following decades.     During the 2nd century Londinium was at its height and replaced  |Colchester|Camulodunum|  as the capital of  |Roman_Britain|Roman_Britain|  . Its population was around 60,000 inhabitants. It boasted major public buildings, including the largest  |basilica|Basilica|  north of the Alps,  |temples|Roman_Temple| ,  |bath_houses|Thermae| , an  |amphitheatre|Amphitheatre|  and a large  |fort|Fort|  for the city garrison. Political instability and recession from the 3rd century onwards led to a slow decline.     At some time between AD 180 and AD 225, the Romans built the defensive  |London_Wall|London_Wall|  around the landward side of the city. The wall was about  long,  high, and  thick. The wall would survive for another 1,600 years and define the  |City_of_Londons|City_Of_London|  perimeters for centuries to come. The perimeters of the present City are roughly defined by the line of the ancient wall.     Londonium was an ethnically diverse city with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia,  |continental_Europe|Continental_Europe| , the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| , and  |North_Africa|North_Africa| . ,  |BBC|Bbc| , 23 November 2015     In the late 3rd century, Londinium was raided on several occasions by Saxon pirates.  This led, from around 255 onwards, to the construction of an additional riverside wall. Six of the traditional seven city gates of London are of Roman origin, namely:  |Ludgate|Ludgate| ,  |Newgate|Newgate| ,  |Aldersgate|Aldersgate| ,  |Cripplegate|Cripplegate| ,  |Bishopsgate|Bishopsgate|  and  |Aldgate|Aldgate|  .     By the 5th century, the Roman Empire was in rapid decline and in AD 410, the Roman occupation of Britannia came to an end. Following this, the Roman city also went into rapid decline and by the end of the 5th century was practically abandoned.          Until recently it was believed that  |Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxon|  settlement initially avoided the area immediately around Londinium. However, the discovery in 2008 of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at  |Covent_Garden|Covent_Garden|  indicates that the incomers had begun to settle there at least as early as the 6th century and possibly in the 5th. The main focus of this settlement was outside the Roman walls, clustering a short distance to the west along what is now the  |Strand|Strand,_London| , between the  |Aldwych|Aldwych|  and  |Trafalgar_Square|Trafalgar_Square| . It was known as Lundenwic, the -wic suffix here denoting a trading settlement. Recent excavations have also highlighted the population density and relatively sophisticated urban organisation of this earlier Anglo-Saxon London, which was laid out on a grid pattern and grew to house a likely population of 10-12,000.     Early Anglo-Saxon London belonged to a people known as the  |Middle_Saxons|Middle_Saxons| , from whom the name of the county of  |Middlesex|Middlesex|  is derived, but who probably also occupied the approximate area of modern  |Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire|  and  |Surrey|Surrey| . However, by the early 7th century the London area had been incorporated into the kingdom of the  |East_Saxons|East_Saxons| . In 604 King  |Saeberht_of_Essex|Saeberht_Of_Essex|  converted to Christianity and London received  |Mellitus|Mellitus| , its first post-Roman bishop.     At this time Essex was under the overlordship of King  |Æthelberht_of_Kent|Æthelberht_Of_Kent| , and it was under Æthelberhts patronage that Mellitus founded the first  |St._Pauls_Cathedral|St._Pauls_Cathedral| , traditionally said to be on the site of an old Roman Temple of Diana . It would have only been a modest church at first and may well have been destroyed after he was expelled from the city by Saeberhts  |pagan|Paganism|  successors.     The permanent establishment of Christianity in the East Saxon kingdom took place in the reign of King  |Sigeberht_II|Sigeberht_The_Good|  in the 650s. During the 8th century, the kingdom of  |Mercia|Mercia|  extended its dominance over south-eastern England, initially through overlordship which at times developed into outright annexation. London seems to have come under direct Mercian control in the 730s.              |Viking|Viking|  attacks dominated most of the 9th century, becoming increasingly common from around 830 onwards. London was sacked in 842 and again in 851. The  |Danish|Denmark| |Great_Heathen_Army|Great_Heathen_Army|  , which had rampaged across England since 865, wintered in London in 871. The city remained in Danish hands until 886, when it was captured by the forces of King  |Alfred_the_Great|Alfred_The_Great|  of  |Wessex|Wessex|  and reincorporated into Mercia, then governed under Alfreds sovereignty by his son-in-law  |Ealdorman|Ealdorman| |Æthelred|Earl_Aethelred_Of_Mercia| .          Around this time the focus of settlement moved within the old Roman walls for the sake of defence, and the city became known as  Lundenburh . The Roman walls were repaired and the defensive ditch re-cut, while the bridge was probably rebuilt at this time. A second fortified  |Borough|Borough|  was established on the south bank at  |Southwark|Southwark| , the Suthringa Geworc . The old settlement of Lundenwic became known as the ealdwic or old settlement , a name which survives today as Aldwich.     From this point, the City of London began to develop its own unique local government. Following Ethelreds death in 911 it was transferred to Wessex, preceding the absorption of the rest of Mercia in 918. Although it faced competition for political pre-eminence in the united  |Kingdom_of_England|Kingdom_Of_England|  from the traditional West Saxon centre of  |Winchester|Winchester| , Londons size and commercial wealth brought it a steadily increasing importance as a focus of governmental activity. King  |Athelstan|Athelstan_Of_England|  held many meetings of the witan in London and issued laws from there, while King  |Æthelred_the_Unready|Æthelred_The_Unready|  issued the  |Laws_of_London|Laws_Of_London|  there in 978.     Following the resumption of Viking attacks in the reign of Ethelred, London was unsuccessfully attacked in 994 by an army under King  |Sweyn_Forkbeard|Sweyn_Forkbeard|  of Denmark. As English resistance to the sustained and escalating Danish onslaught finally collapsed in 1013, London repulsed an attack by the Danes and was the last place to hold out while the rest of the country submitted to Sweyn, but by the end of the year it too capitulated and Æthelred fled abroad. Sweyn died just five weeks after having been proclaimed king and Æthelred was restored to the throne, but Sweyns son  |Cnut|Canute_The_Great|  returned to the attack in 1015.     After Æthelreds death at London in 1016 his son  |Edmund_Ironside|Edmund_Ironside|  was proclaimed king there by the  witangemot  and left to gather forces in Wessex. London was then subjected to a systematic siege by Cnut but was relieved by King Edmunds army; when Edmund again left to recruit reinforcements in Wessex the Danes resumed the siege but were again unsuccessful. However, following his defeat at the  |Battle_of_Assandun|Battle_Of_Assandun|  Edmund ceded to Cnut all of England north of the Thames, including London, and his death a few weeks later left Cnut in control of the whole country.     A Norse saga tells of a battle when King Æthelred returned to attack Danish-occupied London. According to the saga, the Danes lined  |London_Bridge|London_Bridge|  and showered the attackers with spears. Undaunted, the attackers pulled the roofs off nearby houses and held them over their heads in the boats. Thus protected, they were able to get close enough to the bridge to attach ropes to the piers and pull the bridge down, thus ending the Viking occupation of London. This story presumably relates to Æthelreds return to power after Sweyns death in 1014, but there is no strong evidence of any such struggle for control of London on that occasion.     Following the extinction of Cnuts dynasty in 1042 English rule was restored under  |Edward_the_Confessor|Edward_The_Confessor| . He was responsible for the foundation of  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey|  and spent much of his time at  |Westminster|Westminster| , which from this time steadily supplanted the City itself as the centre of government. Edwards death at Westminster in 1066 without a clear heir led to a succession dispute and the  |Norman_conquest_of_England|Norman_Conquest_Of_England| . Earl  |Harold_Godwinson|Harold_Godwinson|  was elected king by the witangemot and crowned in Westminster Abbey but was defeated and killed by  |William_the_Bastard,_Duke_of_Normandy|William_I_Of_England|  at the  |Battle_of_Hastings|Battle_Of_Hastings| . The surviving members of the witan met in London and elected King Edwards young nephew  |Edgar_the_Ætheling|Edgar_The_Ætheling|  as king.     The  |Normans|Normans|  advanced to the south bank of the Thames opposite London, where they defeated an English attack and burned Southwark but were unable to storm the bridge. They moved upstream and crossed the river at  |Wallingford|Wallingford,_Oxfordshire|  before advancing on London from the north-west. The resolve of the English leadership to resist collapsed and the chief citizens of London went out together with the leading members of the Church and aristocracy to submit to William at  |Berkhamstead|Berkhamstead| , although according to some accounts there was a subsequent violent clash when the Normans reached the city. Having occupied London, William was crowned king in Westminster Abbey.               The new Norman regime established new fortresses within the city to dominate the native population. By far the most important of these was the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London|  at the eastern end of the city, where the initial timber fortification was rapidly replaced by the construction of the first stone castle in England. The smaller forts of  |Baynards_Castle|Baynards_Castle|  and  |Montfichets_Castle|Montfichets_Castle|  were also established along the waterfront. King William also granted a  |charter|Charter|  in 1067 confirming the citys existing rights, privileges and laws. London was a centre of Englands nascent  |Jewish_population|History_Of_The_Jews_In_England| , the first of whom arrived in about 1070. Jacobs, Joseph. TITLE. JewishEncyclopedia.com. 2018-07-04. URL:. Accessed: 2018-07-04.  Its growing self-government was consolidated by the election rights granted by  |King_John|John_Of_England|  in 1199 and 1215.     In 1097,  |William_Rufus|William_Rufus| , the son of William the Conqueror began the construction of Westminster Hall, which became the focus of the  |Palace_of_Westminster|Palace_Of_Westminster| .     In 1176, construction began of the most famous incarnation of  |London_Bridge|London_Bridge|  which was built on the site of several earlier timber bridges. This bridge would last for 600 years, and remained the only bridge across the  |River_Thames|River_Thames|  until 1739.     Violence against Jews took place in 1190, after it was rumoured that the new King had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.      In 1216, during the  |First_Barons_War|First_Barons_War|  London was occupied by  |Prince_Louis_of_France|Louis_Viii_Of_France| , who had been called in by the baronial rebels against  |King_John|John_Of_England|  and was acclaimed as King of England in  |St_Pauls_Cathedral|Old_St._Pauls_Cathedral| . However, following Johns death in 1217 Louiss supporters reverted to their  |Plantagenet|Plantagenet|  allegiance, rallying round Johns son  |Henry_III|Henry_Iii_Of_England| , and Louis was forced to withdraw from England.     In 1224, after an accusation of  |ritual_murder|Ritual_Murder| , the Jewish community was subjected to a steep punitive levy. Then in 1232, Henry III confiscated the principal  |synagogue|Synagogue|  of the London Jewish community because he claimed their chanting was audible in a neighboring church.  In 1264, during the  |Second_Barons_War|Second_Barons_War| ,  |Simon_de_Montforts|Simon_De_Montfort,_6Th_Earl_Of_Leicester|  rebels occupied London and killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts. ; see p88-99     Londons Jewish community was forced to leave England by the  |expulsion|Edict_Of_Expulsion|  by  |Edward_I|Edward_I_Of_England|  in 1290. They left for France, Holland and further afield; their property was seized, and many suffered robbery and murder as they departed.     Over the following centuries, London would shake off the heavy French cultural and linguistic influence which had been there since the times of the Norman conquest. The city would figure heavily in the development of  |Early_Modern_English|Early_Modern_English| .        During the  |Peasants_Revolt|Peasants_Revolt|  of 1381, London was invaded by rebels led by  |Wat_Tyler|Wat_Tyler| . A group of peasants stormed the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London|  and executed the  |Lord_Chancellor|Lord_Chancellor| , Archbishop  |Simon_Sudbury|Simon_Sudbury| , and the  |Lord_Treasurer|Lord_Treasurer| . The peasants looted the city and set fire to numerous buildings. Tyler was stabbed to death by the Lord Mayor  |William_Walworth|William_Walworth|  in a confrontation at  |Smithfield|Smithfield,_London|  and the revolt collapsed.     Trade increased steadily during the Middle Ages, and London grew rapidly as a result. In 1100, Londons population was somewhat more than 15,000. By 1300, it had grown to roughly 80,000. London lost at least half of its population during the  |Black_Death|Black_Death|  in the mid-14th century, but its economic and political importance stimulated a rapid recovery despite further epidemics. Trade in London was organised into various  |guilds|Guild| , which effectively controlled the city, and elected the  |Lord_Mayor_of_the_City_of_London|Lord_Mayor_Of_The_City_Of_London| .     Medieval London was made up of narrow and twisting streets, and most of the buildings were made from combustible materials such as timber and straw, which made fire a constant threat, while sanitation in cities was of low-quality.                        In 1475, the  |Hanseatic_League|Hanseatic_League|  set up its main English trading base  in London, called Stalhof or  Steelyard . It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of  |Lübeck|Lübeck| ,  |Bremen|Bremen|  and  |Hamburg|Hamburg|  sold the property to  |South_Eastern_Railway|South_Eastern_Railway,_Uk| .   |Woollen|Woollen|  cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries| , where it was considered indispensable.

CUP Archive     During the  |Reformation|English_Reformation| , London was the principal early centre of  |Protestantism|Protestantism|  in England. Its close commercial connections with the Protestant heartlands in northern continental Europe, large foreign mercantile communities, disproportionately large number of literate inhabitants and role as the centre of the English print trade all contributed to the spread of the new ideas of religious reform. Before the Reformation, more than half of the area of London was the property of  |monasteries|Monasteries| ,  |nunneries|Nunnery|  and other religious houses.  |Nikolaus_Pevsner|Nikolaus_Pevsner| , London I: The Cities of London and Westminster rev. edition,1962, Introduction p 48.      |Henry_VIIIs|Henry_Viii_Of_England| |Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries|Dissolution_Of_The_Monasteries|  had a profound effect on the city as nearly all of this property changed hands. The process started in the mid 1530s, and by 1538 most of the larger monastic houses had been abolished. Holy Trinity Aldgate went to  |Lord_Audley|John_Tuchet,_8Th_Baron_Audley| , and the  |Marquess_of_Winchester|William_Paulet,_1St_Marquess_Of_Winchester|  built himself a house in part of its precincts. The  |Charterhouse|London_Charterhouse|  went to Lord North, Blackfriars to  |Lord_Cobham|W:George_Brooke,_9Th_Baron_Cobham| , the leper hospital of St Giles to Lord Dudley, while the king took for himself the leper hospital of St James, which was rebuilt as  |St_Jamess_Palace|St_Jamess_Palace| .     The period saw London rapidly rising in importance among Europes commercial centres. Trade expanded beyond Western Europe to Russia, the Levant, and the Americas. This was the period of  |mercantilism|Mercantilism|  and monopoly trading companies such as the  |Muscovy_Company|Muscovy_Company|  and the  |British_East_India_Company|British_East_India_Company|  were established in London by Royal Charter. The latter, which ultimately came to rule India, was one of the key institutions in London, and in Britain as a whole, for two and a half centuries. Immigrants arrived in London not just from all over England and Wales, but from abroad as well, for example Huguenots from France; the population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605. The growth of the population and wealth of London was fuelled by a vast expansion in the use of coastal shipping.     The late 16th and early 17th century saw the great flourishing of drama in London whose preeminent figure was  |William_Shakespeare|William_Shakespeare| . During the mostly calm later years of Elizabeths reign, some of her courtiers and some of the wealthier citizens of London built themselves country residences in  |Middlesex|Middlesex| ,  |Essex|Essex|  and  |Surrey|Surrey| . This was an early stirring of the villa movement, the taste for residences which were neither of the city nor on an agricultural estate, but at the time of Elizabeths death in 1603, London was still very compact.          Xenophobia was rampant in London, and increased after the 1580s. Many immigrants became disillusioned by routine threats of violence and molestation, attempts at expulsion of foreigners, and the great difficulty in acquiring English citizenship. Dutch cities proved more hospitable, and many left London permanently. Bich Luu Lien, Taking the Bread Out of Our Mouths: Xenophobia in Early Modern London, Immigrants and Minorities, July 2000, Vol. 19 Issue 2, pp 1-22 Foreigners are estimated to have made up 4,000 of the 100,000 residents of London by 1600, many being Dutch and German workers and traders.                Londons expansion beyond the boundaries of the City was decisively established in the 17th century. In the opening years of that century the immediate environs of the City, with the principal exception of the aristocratic residences in the direction of Westminster, were still considered not conducive to health. Immediately to the north was  |Moorfields|Moorfields| , which had recently been drained and laid out in walks, but it was frequented by beggars and travellers, who crossed it in order to get into London. Adjoining Moorfields were  |Finsbury|Finsbury|  Fields, a favourite practising ground for the archers,  |Mile_End|Mile_End| , then a common on the Great Eastern Road and famous as a rendezvous for the troops.     The preparations for  |King_James_I|James_I_Of_England|  becoming king were interrupted by a severe plague epidemic, which may have killed over thirty thousand people. The  |Lord_Mayors_Show|Lord_Mayors_Show| , which had been discontinued for some years, was revived by order of the king in 1609. The dissolved monastery of the  |Charterhouse|London_Charterhouse| , which had been bought and sold by the courtiers several times, was purchased by  |Thomas_Sutton|Thomas_Sutton|  for £13,000. The new hospital, chapel, and schoolhouse were begun in 1611.  |Charterhouse_School|Charterhouse_School|  was to be one of the principal  |public_schools|Public_School|  in London until it moved to Surrey in Victorian times, and the site is still used as a  |medical_school|Barts_And_The_London,_Queen_Marys_School_Of_Medicine_And_Dentistry| . Sheila Hannah Williams, The Lord Mayors Show in Tudor and Stuart Times .     The general meeting-place of Londoners in the day-time was the nave of  |Old_St._Pauls_Cathedral|Old_St._Pauls_Cathedral| . Merchants conducted business in the aisles, and used the font as a counter upon which to make their payments; lawyers received clients at their particular pillars; and the unemployed looked for work. St Pauls Churchyard was the centre of the book trade and  |Fleet_Street|Fleet_Street|  was a centre of public entertainment. Under James I the theatre, which established itself so firmly in the latter years of Elizabeth, grew further in popularity. The performances at the public theatres were complemented by elaborate  |masques|Masques|  at the royal court and at the inns of court. Michael Berlin, Civic ceremony in early modern London.

During his reign, aristocrats began to inhabit the  |West_End|West_End_Of_London|  in large numbers. In addition to those who had specific business at court, increasing numbers of country landowners and their families lived in London for part of the year simply for the social life. This was the beginning of the London season .  |Lincolns_Inn_Fields|Lincolns_Inn_Fields|  was built about 1629.

John Summerson, Inigo Jones        In January 1642  |five_members|Five_Members|  of parliament whom the King wished to arrest were granted refuge in the City. In August of the same year the King raised his banner at  |Nottingham|Nottingham| , and during the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War|  London took the side of the parliament. Initially the king had the upper hand in military terms and in November he won the  |Battle_of_Brentford|Battle_Of_Brentford|  a few miles to the west of London. The City organised a new makeshift army and Charles hesitated and retreated. Subsequently, an extensive system of fortifications was built to protect London from a renewed attack by the Royalists. This comprised a strong earthen rampart, enhanced with bastions and redoubts. It was well beyond the City walls and encompassed the whole urban area, including Westminster and Southwark. London was not seriously threatened by the royalists again, and the financial resources of the City made an important contribution to the parliamentarians victory in the war.     The unsanitary and overcrowded City of London has suffered from the numerous outbreaks of the plague many times over the centuries, but in Britain it is the last major outbreak which is remembered as the  |Great_Plague|Great_Plague_Of_London|  It occurred in 1665 and 1666 and killed around 60,000 people, which was one fifth of the population.  |Samuel_Pepys|Samuel_Pepys|  chronicled the epidemic in his diary. On 4 September 1665 he wrote I have stayed in the city till above 7400 died in one week, and of them about 6000 of the plague, and little noise heard day or night but tolling of bells.  Walter George Bell, The Great Plague in London .          The Great Plague was immediately followed by another catastrophe, albeit one which helped to put an end to the plague. On the Sunday, 2 September 1666 the  |Great_Fire_of_London|Great_Fire_Of_London|  broke out at one oclock in the morning at a bakery in  |Pudding_Lane|Pudding_Lane|  in the southern part of the City. Fanned by an eastern wind the fire spread, and efforts to arrest it by pulling down houses to make firebreaks were disorganised to begin with. On Tuesday night the wind fell somewhat, and on Wednesday the fire slackened. On Thursday it was extinguished, but on the evening of that day the flames again burst forth at the Temple. Some houses were at once blown up by gunpowder, and thus the fire was finally mastered.  |The_Monument|The_Monument|  was built to commemorate the fire: for over a century and a half it bore an inscription attributing the conflagration to a  popish frenzy . Peter Ackroyd, The great fire of London        The fire destroyed about 60% of the City, including  |Old_St_Pauls_Cathedral|Old_St_Pauls_Cathedral| , 87 parish churches, 44  |livery_company|Livery_Company|  halls and the  |Royal_Exchange|Royal_Exchange,_London| . However, the number of lives lost was surprisingly small; it is believed to have been 16 at most. Within a few days of the fire, three plans were presented to the king for the rebuilding of the city, by  |Christopher_Wren|Christopher_Wren| ,  |John_Evelyn|John_Evelyn|  and  |Robert_Hooke|Robert_Hooke| . Thomas Fiddian Reddaway, The rebuilding of London after the great fire .     Wren proposed to build main thoroughfares north and south, and east and west, to insulate all the churches in conspicuous positions, to form the most public places into large piazzas, to unite the halls of the 12 chief livery companies into one regular square annexed to the  |Guildhall|Guildhall,_London| , and to make a fine quay on the bank of the river from  |Blackfriars|Blackfriars,_London|  to the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London| . Wren wished to build the new streets straight and in three standard widths of thirty, sixty and ninety feet. Evelyns plan differed from Wrens chiefly in proposing a street from the church of  |St_Dunstans_in_the_East|St_Dunstans_In_The_East|  to the St Pauls, and in having no quay or terrace along the river. These plans were not implemented, and the rebuilt city generally followed the streetplan of the old one, and most of it has survived into the 21st century.          Nonetheless, the new City was different from the old one. Many aristocratic residents never returned, preferring to take new houses in the West End, where fashionable new districts such as  |St._Jamess|St._Jamess|  were built close to the main royal residence, which was  |Whitehall_Palace|Whitehall_Palace|  until it was destroyed by fire in the 1690s, and thereafter  |St._Jamess_Palace|St._Jamess_Palace| . The rural lane of  |Piccadilly|Piccadilly|  sprouted courtiers mansions such as  |Burlington_House|Burlington_House| . Thus the separation between the middle class mercantile City of London, and the aristocratic world of the court in  |Westminster|Palace_Of_Westminster|  became complete. Timothy Baker, London: rebuilding the city after the great fire     In the City itself there was a move from wooden buildings to stone and brick construction to reduce the risk of fire. Parliaments  |Rebuilding_of_London_Act_1666|Rebuilding_Of_London_Act_1666|  stated  building with brick not only more comely and durable, but also more safe against future perils of fire . From then on only doorcases, window-frames and shop fronts were allowed to be made of wood.      Christopher Wrens plan for a new model London came to nothing, but he was appointed to rebuild the ruined parish churches and to replace  |St_Pauls_Cathedral|St_Pauls_Cathedral| . His domed  |baroque|Baroque|  cathedral was the primary symbol of London for at least a century and a half. As city surveyor,  |Robert_Hooke|Robert_Hooke|  oversaw the reconstruction of the Citys houses. The  |East_End|East_End| , that is the area immediately to the east of the city walls, also became heavily populated in the decades after the Great Fire. Londons docks began to extend downstream, attracting many working people who worked on the docks themselves and in the processing and distributive trades. These people lived in  |Whitechapel|Whitechapel| ,  |Wapping|Wapping| ,  |Stepney|Stepney|  and  |Limehouse|Limehouse| , generally in slum conditions. Michael Alan Ralph Cooper, A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London After the Great Fire     In the winter of 1683–1684, a  |frost_fair|Thames_Frost_Fairs|  was held on the Thames. The frost, which began about seven weeks before Christmas and continued for six weeks after, was the greatest on record. The  |Revocation_of_the_Edict_of_Nantes|Revocation_Of_The_Edict_Of_Nantes|  in 1685 led to a large migration on  |Huguenots|Huguenots|  to London. They established a silk industry at  |Spitalfields|Spitalfields| .      At this time the  |Bank_of_England|Bank_Of_England|  was founded, and the British East India Company was expanding its influence.  |Lloyds_of_London|Lloyds_Of_London|  also began to operate in the late 17th century. In 1700, London handled 80% of Englands imports, 69% of its exports and 86% of its re-exports. Many of the goods were luxuries from the Americas and Asia such as silk, sugar, tea and tobacco. The last figure emphasises Londons role as an  |entrepot|Entrepot| |William_III|William_Iii_Of_England| , a Dutchman, cared little for London, the smoke of which gave him asthma, and after the first fire at Whitehall Palace he purchased Nottingham House and transformed it into  |Kensington_Palace|Kensington_Palace| .  |Kensington|Kensington|  was then an insignificant village, but the arrival of the court soon caused it to grow in importance. The palace was rarely favoured by future monarchs, but its construction was another step in the expansion of the bounds of London. During the same reign  |Greenwich_Hospital|Greenwich_Hospital| , then well outside the boundary of London, but now comfortably inside it, was begun; it was the naval complement to the  |Chelsea_Hospital|Chelsea_Hospital|  for former soldiers, which had been founded in 1681. During the reign of  |Queen_Anne|Anne,_Queen_Of_Great_Britain|  an act was passed authorising the building of 50 new churches to serve the greatly increased population living outside the boundaries of the City of London. Jason R. Ali and Peter Cunich. The Church East and West: Orienting the Queen Anne Churches, 1711-34. The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians : 56-73.                   The 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , and Londons role at the centre of the evolving  |British_Empire|British_Empire| .     In 1707, an  |Act_of_Union|Acts_Of_Union_1707|  was passed merging the Scottish and the English Parliaments, thus establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain. A year later, in 1708 Christopher Wrens masterpiece,  |St_Pauls_Cathedral|St_Pauls_Cathedral|  was completed on his birthday. However, the first service had been held on 2 December 1697; more than 10 years earlier. This Cathedral replaced the original St. Pauls which had been completely destroyed in the  |Great_Fire_of_London|Great_Fire_Of_London| . This building is considered one of the finest in Britain and a fine example of  |Baroque_architecture|Baroque_Architecture| .          Many tradesmen from different countries came to London to trade goods and merchandise. Also, more immigrants moved to London making the population greater. More people also moved to London for work and for business making London an altogether bigger and busier city.  |Britains_victory_in_the_Seven_Years_War|Great_Britain_In_The_Seven_Years_War|  increased the countrys international standing and opened large new markets to British trade, further boosting Londons prosperity.     During the Georgian period London spread beyond its traditional limits at an accelerating pace. This is shown in a series of detailed maps, particularly  |John_Rocques|John_Rocque|  1741–45 map  and his  |1746_Map_of_London|John_Rocques_Map_Of_London,_1746| . New districts such as  |Mayfair|Mayfair|  were built for the rich in the West End, new bridges over the Thames encouraged an acceleration of development in  |South_London|South_London|  and in the East End, the  |Port_of_London|Port_Of_London|  expanded downstream from the City. During this period was also the uprising of the American colonies. In 1780, the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London|  held its only American prisoner, former President of the  |Continental_Congress|Continental_Congress| ,  |Henry_Laurens|Henry_Laurens| . In 1779, he was the Congresss representative of Holland, and got the countrys support for the Revolution. On his return voyage back to America, the Royal Navy captured him and charged him with treason after finding evidence of a reason of war between Great Britain and the Netherlands. He was released from the Tower on 21 December 1781 in exchange for General  |Lord_Cornwallis|Charles_Cornwallis,_1St_Marquess_Cornwallis| .     In 1762,  |George_III|George_Iii_Of_Great_Britain|  acquired  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace|  from the Duke of Buckingham. It was enlarged over the next 75 years by architects such as John Nash.          |A_phenomenon_of_the_era_was_the_coffeehouse|English_Coffeehouses_In_The_17Th_And_18Th_Centuries| , which became a popular place to debate ideas. Growing literacy and the development of the  |printing_press|Printing_Press|  meant that news became widely available.  |Fleet_Street|Fleet_Street|  became the centre of the embryonic national press during the century.     18th-century London was dogged by crime. The  |Bow_Street_Runners|Bow_Street_Runners|  were established in 1750 as a professional police force. Penalties for crime were harsh, with the death penalty being applied for fairly minor crimes. Public  |hangings|Hanging|  were common in London, and were popular public events.     In 1780, London was rocked by the  |Gordon_Riots|Gordon_Riots| , an uprising by  |Protestants|Protestant|  against  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  emancipation led by  |Lord_George_Gordon|Lord_George_Gordon| . Severe damage was caused to Catholic churches and homes, and 285 rioters were killed.     In the year 1787, freed slaves from London, America, and many of Britains colonies founded  |Freetown|Freetown|  in modern-day Sierra Leone.     Up until 1750,  |London_Bridge|London_Bridge|  was the only crossing over the  |Thames|Thames| , but in that year  |Westminster_Bridge|Westminster_Bridge|  was opened and, for the first time in history, London Bridge, in a sense, had a rival. In 1798, Frankfurt banker  |Nathan_Mayer_Rothschild|Nathan_Mayer_Rothschild|  arrived in London and set up a banking house in the city, with a large sum of money given to him by his father,  |Amschel_Mayer_Rothschild|Amschel_Mayer_Rothschild| . The Rothschilds also had banks in Paris and Vienna. The bank financed numerous large-scale projects, especially regarding railways around the world and the Suez Canal. Niall Ferguson, The House of Rothschild 2:171-75, 297-304     The 18th century saw the breakaway of the American colonies and many other unfortunate events in London, but also great change and Enlightenment. This all led into the beginning of modern times, the 19th century.                  During the 19th century, London was transformed into the worlds largest city and capital of the British Empire. Its population expanded from 1  million in 1800 to 6.7  million a century later. During this period, London became a global political, financial, and trading capital. In this position, it was largely unrivalled until the latter part of the century, when  |Paris|Paris|  and  |New_York|New_York_City|  began to threaten its dominance.     While the city grew wealthy as Britains holdings expanded, 19th-century London was also a city of poverty, where millions lived in overcrowded and unsanitary  |slums|Slum| . Life for the poor was immortalised by  |Charles_Dickens|Charles_Dickens|  in such novels as  |Oliver_Twist|Oliver_Twist|  In 1810, after the death of  |Sir_Francis_Baring|Sir_Francis_Baring|  and Abraham Goldsmid, Rothschild emerges as the major banker in London.     In 1829, the then Home Secretary  |Robert_Peel|Robert_Peel|  established the  |Metropolitan_Police|Metropolitan_Police_Service|  as a police force covering the entire urban area. The force gained the nickname of bobbies or peelers named after Robert Peel.     19th-century London was transformed by the coming of the railways. A new network of metropolitan railways allowed for the development of suburbs in neighbouring counties from which middle-class and wealthy people could commute to the centre. While this spurred the massive outward growth of the city, the growth of greater London also exacerbated the class divide, as the wealthier classes emigrated to the suburbs, leaving the poor to inhabit the inner city areas.     The first railway to be built in London was a line from  |London_Bridge|London_Bridge|  to  |Greenwich|Greenwich| , which opened in 1836. This was soon followed by the opening of great rail termini which eventually linked London to every corner of Great Britain, including  |Euston_station|Euston_Railway_Station|  ,  |Paddington_station|Paddington_Station|  ,  |Fenchurch_Street_station|Fenchurch_Street_Station|  ,  |Waterloo_station|London_Waterloo_Railway_Station|  ,  |Kings_Cross_station|London_Kings_Cross_Railway_Station|  , and  |St_Pancras_station|St_Pancras_Station|  . From 1863, the first lines of the  |London_Underground|London_Underground|  were constructed.     The urbanised area continued to grow rapidly, spreading into  |Islington|Islington| ,  |Paddington|Paddington| ,  |Belgravia|Belgravia| ,  |Holborn|Holborn| ,  |Finsbury|Finsbury| ,  |Shoreditch|Shoreditch| ,  |Southwark|Southwark|  and  |Lambeth|Lambeth| . Towards the middle of the century, Londons antiquated local government system, consisting of ancient parishes and  |vestries|Vestry| , struggled to cope with the rapid growth in population. In 1855, the  |Metropolitan_Board_of_Works|Metropolitan_Board_Of_Works|  was created to provide London with adequate infrastructure to cope with its growth. One of its first tasks was addressing Londons sanitation problems. At the time, raw  |sewage|Sewage|  was pumped straight into the  |River_Thames|River_Thames| . This culminated in  |The_Great_Stink|The_Great_Stink|  of 1858. Lee Jackson, Dirty Old London: The Victorian Fight Against Filth Parliament finally gave consent for the MBW to construct a large system of  |sewers|Sanitary_Sewer| . The engineer put in charge of building the new system was  |Joseph_Bazalgette|Joseph_Bazalgette| . In what was one of the largest  |civil_engineering|Civil_Engineering|  projects of the 19th century, he oversaw construction of over 2100  km of tunnels and pipes under London to take away sewage and provide clean drinking water. When the  |London_sewerage_system|London_Sewerage_System|  was completed, the death toll in London dropped dramatically, and epidemics of  |cholera|Cholera|  and other diseases were curtailed. Bazalgettes system is still in use today. Stephen Halliday, The great stink of London: Sir Joseph Bazalgette and the cleansing of the Victorian metropolis     One of the most famous events of 19th-century London was the  |Great_Exhibition_of_1851|Great_Exhibition_Of_1851| . Held at  |The_Crystal_Palace|The_Crystal_Palace| , the fair attracted 6  million visitors from across the world and displayed Britain at the height of its Imperial dominance. Jeffrey A., Auerbach, ed. The Great Exhibition of 1851: a nation on display      As the capital of a massive empire, London became a magnet for immigrants from the colonies and poorer parts of Europe. A large Irish population settled in the city during the Victorian period, with many of the newcomers refugees from the  |Great_Famine|Great_Irish_Famine| . At one point, Catholic Irish made up about 20% of Londons population; they typically lived in overcrowded slums. Lynn Hollen Lees, Exiles of Erin: Irish Migrants in Victorian London London also became home to  |a_sizable_Jewish_community|History_Of_The_Jews_In_England| , which was notable for its entrepreneurship in the clothing trade and merchandising. Andrew Godley, Jewish Immigrant Entrepreneurship in New York and London, 1880–1914     In 1888, the new  |County_of_London|County_Of_London|  was established, administered by the  |London_County_Council|London_County_Council| . This was the first elected London-wide administrative body, replacing the earlier Metropolitan Board of Works, which had been made up of appointees. The County of London covered broadly what was then the full extent of the London conurbation, although the conurbation later outgrew the boundaries of the county. In 1900, the county was sub-divided into 28  |metropolitan_boroughs|Metropolitan_Boroughs_Of_The_County_Of_London| , which formed a more local tier of administration than the county council.     Many famous buildings and landmarks of London were constructed during the 19th century including:    |Trafalgar_Square|Trafalgar_Square| |Big_Ben|Clock_Tower,_Palace_Of_Westminster|  and the  |Houses_of_Parliament|Palace_Of_Westminster| |Royal_Albert_Hall|Royal_Albert_Hall| |Victoria_and_Albert_Museum|Victoria_And_Albert_Museum| |Tower_Bridge|Tower_Bridge|                 London entered the 20th century at the height of its influence as the capital of one of the largest empires in history, but the new century was to bring many challenges.     Londons population continued to grow rapidly in the early decades of the century, and  |public_transport|Public_Transport|  was greatly expanded. A large tram network was constructed by the London County Council, through the  |LCC_Tramways|London_County_Council_Tramways| ; the first  |motorbus|Bus|  service began in the 1900s. Improvements to Londons overground and underground rail network, including large scale electrification were progressively carried out.     During World War I, London experienced its first bombing raids carried out by German  |zeppelin|Zeppelin| |airships|Airship| ; these killed around 700 people and caused great terror, but were merely a foretaste of what was to come. The city of London would experience many more terrors as a result of both World Wars. The largest explosion in London occurred during World War I: the  |Silvertown_explosion|Silvertown_Explosion| , when a munitions factory containing 50 tons of  |TNT|Trinitrotoluene|  exploded, killing 73 and injuring 400.     The  |period_between_the_two_World_Wars|Interwar|  saw Londons geographical extent growing more quickly than ever before or since. A preference for lower density suburban housing, typically  |semi-detached|Semi-Detached| , by Londoners seeking a more rural lifestyle, superseded Londoners old predilection for  |terraced_houses|Terraced_House| . This was facilitated not only by a continuing expansion of the rail network, including trams and the Underground, but also by slowly widening car ownership. Londons suburbs expanded outside the boundaries of the County of London, into the neighbouring counties of  |Essex|Essex| ,  |Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire| ,  |Kent|Kent| ,  |Middlesex|Middlesex|  and  |Surrey|Surrey| .     Like the rest of the country, London suffered severe unemployment during the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression|  of the 1930s. In the  |East_End|East_End_Of_London|  during the 1930s, politically extreme parties of both right and left flourished. The  |Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain|Communist_Party_Of_Great_Britain|  and the  |British_Union_of_Fascists|British_Union_Of_Fascists|  both gained serious support. Clashes between right and left culminated in the  |Battle_of_Cable_Street|Battle_Of_Cable_Street|  in 1936. The population of London reached an all-time peak of 8.6  million in 1939.     Large numbers of Jewish immigrants fleeing from  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  settled in London during the 1930s, mostly in the  |East_End|East_End_Of_London| .     Labour Party politician  |Herbert_Morrison|Herbert_Morrison|  was a dominant figure in local government in the 1920s and 1930s. He became mayor of Hackney and a member of the London County Council in 1922, and for a while was Minister of Transport in Ramsay MacDonalds cabinet. When Labour gained power in London in 1934, Morrison unified the bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the  |London_Passenger_Transport_Board|London_Passenger_Transport_Board|  in 1933., He led the effort to finance and build the new  |Waterloo_Bridge|Waterloo_Bridge| . He designed the  |Metropolitan_Green_Belt|Metropolitan_Green_Belt|  around the suburbs and worked to clear slums, build schools, and reform public assistance. George W. Jones and Bernard Donoughue, Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician pp 189-210.               During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , London, as many other British cities, suffered severe damage, being bombed extensively by the  Luftwaffe  as a part of  |The_Blitz|The_Blitz| . Prior to the bombing, hundreds of thousands of children in London were evacuated to the countryside to avoid the bombing. Civilians took shelter from the air raids in underground stations.     The heaviest bombing took place during  |The_Blitz|The_Blitz|  between 7 September 1940 and 10 May 1941. During this period, London was subjected to 71 separate raids receiving over 18,000 tonnes of high explosive. One raid in December 1940, which became known as the  |Second_Great_Fire_of_London|Second_Great_Fire_Of_London| , saw a  |firestorm|Firestorm|  engulf much of the  |City_of_London|City_Of_London|  and destroy many historic buildings.  |St_Pauls_Cathedral|St_Pauls_Cathedral| , however, remained unscathed; a photograph showing the Cathedral shrouded in smoke became a famous image of the war. Maureen Hill, The Blitz. Marks and Spencer, 2002     Having failed to defeat Britain, Hitler turned his attention to the  |Eastern_front|Eastern_Front|  and regular bombing raids ceased. They began again, but on a smaller scale with the  |Little_Blitz|Operation_Steinbock|  in early 1944. Towards the end of the war, during 1944/45 London again came under heavy attack by pilotless  |V-1_flying_bombs|V-1_Flying_Bomb|  and  |V-2_rockets|V-2_Rocket| , which were fired from Nazi occupied Europe. These attacks only came to an end when their launch sites were captured by advancing Allied forces.     London suffered severe damage and heavy casualties, the worst hit part being the  |Docklands|Port_Of_London|  area. By the wars end, just under 30,000 Londoners had been killed by the bombing, and over 50,000 seriously injured,  homefront website tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless. Amy Helen Bell, London was ours: Diaries and memoirs of the London Blitz              Three years after the war, the  |1948_Summer_Olympics|1948_Summer_Olympics|  were held at the original  |Wembley_Stadium|Wembley_Stadium| , at a time when the city had barely recovered from the war. Londons rebuilding was slow to begin. However, in 1951 the  |Festival_of_Britain|Festival_Of_Britain|  was held, which marked an increasing mood of optimism and forward looking.     In the immediate postwar years housing was a major issue in London, due to the large amount of housing which had been destroyed in the war. The authorities decided upon high-rise  |blocks_of_flats|Tower_Block|  as the answer to housing shortages. During the 1950s and 1960s the skyline of London altered dramatically as tower blocks were erected, although these later proved unpopular. In a bid to reduce the number of people living in overcrowded housing, a policy was introduced of encouraging people to move into newly built  |new_towns|New_Townunited_Kingdom|  surrounding London. Richard Quentin Donald Hornsey, The Spiv and the Architect: Unruly Life in Postwar London .     Through the 19th and in the early half of the 20th century, Londoners used coal for heating their homes, which produced large amounts of smoke. In combination with climatic conditions this often caused a characteristic smog, and London became known for its typical London Fog , also known as Pea Soupers . London was sometimes referred to as The Smoke because of this. In 1952, this culminated in the disastrous  |Great_Smog_of_1952|Great_Smog_Of_1952|  which lasted for five days and killed over 4,000 people. In response to this, the  |Clean_Air_Act_1956|Clean_Air_Act_1956|  was passed, mandating the creating of smokeless zones where the use of smokeless fuels was required ; the Act was effective. Devra L. Davis, A look back at the London smog of 1952 and the half century since. Environmental health perspectives 110.12 : A734.        Starting in the mid-1960s, and partly as a result of the success of such UK musicians as  |the_Beatles|The_Beatles|  and  |The_Rolling_Stones|The_Rolling_Stones| , London became a centre for the worldwide  |youth_culture|Youth_Culture| , exemplified by the  |Swinging_London|Swinging_London|  subculture which made  |Carnaby_Street|Carnaby_Street|  a household name of youth fashion around the world. Londons role as a trendsetter for youth fashion continued strongly in the 1980s during the  |new_wave|New_Wave_Music|  and  |punk|Punk_Rock|  eras and into the mid-1990s with the emergence of the  |Britpop|Britpop|  era.     From the 1950s onwards London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations|  countries such as  |Jamaica|Jamaica| ,  |India|India| ,  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh| ,  |Pakistan|Pakistan| , which dramatically changed the face of London, turning it into one of the most diverse cities in Europe. However, the integration of the new immigrants was not always easy. Racial tensions emerged in events such as the  |Brixton_Riots|1981_Brixton_Riot|  in the early 1980s. Matt Cook, ‘Gay Times’: Identity, Locality, Memory, and the Brixton Squats in 1970s London. Twentieth Century British History 241 pp: 84-109.     From the beginning of  |The_Troubles|The_Troubles|  in  |Northern_Ireland|Northern_Ireland|  in the early 1970s until the mid-1990s, London was subjected to repeated  |terrorist_attacks|List_Of_Terrorist_Incidents_In_London|  by the  |Provisional_IRA|Provisional_Ira| .     The outward expansion of London was slowed by the war, and the introduction of the  |Metropolitan_Green_Belt|Metropolitan_Green_Belt| . Due to this outward expansion, in 1965 the old  |County_of_London|County_Of_London|  and the  |London_County_Council|London_County_Council|  were abolished, and the much larger area of  |Greater_London|Greater_London|  was established with a new  |Greater_London_Council|Greater_London_Council|  to administer it, along with 32 new  |London_boroughs|London_Borough| .     Greater Londons population declined steadily in the decades after World War II, from an estimated peak of 8.6  million in 1939 to around 6.8  million in the 1980s. However, it then began to increase again in the late 1980s, encouraged by strong economic performance and an increasingly positive image.     Londons traditional status as a major port declined dramatically in the post-war decades as the old  |Docklands|London_Docklands|  could not accommodate large modern container ships. The principal ports for London moved downstream to the ports of  |Felixstowe|Port_Of_Felixstowe|  and  |Tilbury|Port_Of_Tilbury| . The docklands area had become largely derelict by the 1980s, but was redeveloped into flats and offices from the mid-1980s onwards. The  |Thames_Barrier|Thames_Barrier|  was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the  |North_Sea|North_Sea| .     In the early 1980s political disputes between the GLC run by  |Ken_Livingstone|Ken_Livingstone|  and the  |Conservative|Conservative_Party|  government of  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  led to the GLCs abolition in 1986, with most of its powers relegated to the  |London_boroughs|London_Borough| . This left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration.     In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the  |Greater_London_Authority|Greater_London_Authority|  by  |Tony_Blairs|Tony_Blair|  government, covering the same area of Greater London. The new authority had similar powers to the old GLC, but was made up of a directly elected  |Mayor|Mayor_Of_London|  and a  |London_Assembly|London_Assembly| . The first election took place on 4 May, with  |Ken_Livingstone|Ken_Livingstone|  comfortably regaining his previous post. London was recognised as one of the nine  |regions_of_England|Regions_Of_England| . In global perspective, it was emerging as a  |World_city|World_City|  widely compared to New York and Tokyo. Greg Clark, The Making of a World City: London 1991 to 2021            Around the start of the 21st century, London hosted the much derided  |Millennium_Dome|Millennium_Dome|  at  |Greenwich|Greenwich| , to mark the new century. Other Millennium projects were more successful. One was the largest observation wheel in the world, the Millennium Wheel , or the  |London_Eye|London_Eye| , which was erected as a temporary structure, but soon became a fixture, and draws four million visitors a year. The  |National_Lottery|National_Lottery|  also released a flood of funds for major enhancements to existing attractions, for example the roofing of the Great Court at the  |British_Museum|British_Museum| .     The  |London_Plan|London_Plan| , published by the  |Mayor_of_London|Mayor_Of_London|  in 2004, estimated that the population would reach 8.1  million by 2016, and continue to rise thereafter. This was reflected in a move towards denser, more urban styles of building, including a greatly increased number of  |tall_buildings|Tall_Buildings_In_London| , and proposals for major enhancements to the public transport network. However, funding for projects such as  |Crossrail|Crossrail|  remained a struggle.     On 6 July 2005 London won  |the_right_to_host_the_2012_Olympics_and_Paralympics|London_2012_Olympic_Bid|  making it the first city to host the modern games three times. However, celebrations were cut short the following day when the city was rocked by  |a_series_of_terrorist_attacks|7_July_2005_London_Bombings| . More than 50 were killed and 750 injured in three bombings on  |London_Underground|London_Underground|  trains and a fourth on a double decker bus near Kings Cross.
