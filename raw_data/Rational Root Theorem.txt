In  |algebra|Algebra| , the rational root theorem  states a constraint on  |rational|Rational_Number| |solutions|Equation_Solving|  of a  |polynomial_equation|Polynomial_Equation|      : anxn+ax+  0     with  |integer|Integer|  coefficients ai  and a0,an   0 . Solutions of the equation are also called  |roots|Root_Of_A_Polynomial|  or zeroes of the  |polynomial|Polynomial|  on the left side.     The theorem states that each  |rational|Rational_Number|  solution , written in lowest terms so that  and  are  |relatively_prime|Relatively_Prime| , satisfies:      is an integer  |factor|Divisor|  of the  |constant_term|Constant_Term|  , and      is an integer factor of the leading  |coefficient|Coefficient|  .     The rational root theorem is a special case of  |Gausss_lemma|Gausss_Lemma|  on the factorization of polynomials. The integral root theorem is the special case of the rational root theorem when the leading coefficient is  .         The theorem is used to find all rational roots of a polynomial, if any. It gives a finite number of possible fractions which can be checked to see if they are roots. If a rational root  is found, a linear polynomial  can be factored out of the polynomial using  |polynomial_long_division|Polynomial_Long_Division| , resulting in a polynomial of lower degree whose roots are also roots of the original polynomial.         The general  |cubic_equation|Cubic_Equation|      : ax3+bx2+cx+d0     with integer coefficients has three solutions in the  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane| . If the rational root test finds no rational solutions, then the only way to express the solutions  |algebraically|Algebraic_Expression|  uses  |cube_roots|Cubic_Function| . But if the test finds a rational solution , then factoring out  leaves a  |quadratic_polynomial|Quadratic_Polynomial|  whose two roots, found with the  |quadratic_formula|Quadratic_Formula| , are the remaining two roots of the cubic, avoiding cube roots.             Let     : P     an xn + a x +   + a1 x + a0,   a0,   an         Suppose  for some  |coprime|Coprime|  .     By shifting the constant term  to the right side, and factoring out  on the left side, produces     : p   -a0qn.     Thus,  divides . But  is coprime to  and therefore to , so by  |Euclids_lemma|Euclids_Lemma|   must divide the remaining factor  of the product.     On the other hand, shifting the leading term to the right side and factoring out  on the left side, gives     : q   -anpn.     Reasoning as before, it follows that  divides .          Should there be a nontrivial factor dividing all the coefficients of the polynomial, then one can divide by the  |greatest_common_divisor|Greatest_Common_Divisor|  of the coefficients so as to obtain a primitive polynomial in the sense of  |Gausss_lemma|Gausss_Lemma| ; this does not alter the set of rational roots and only strengthens the divisibility conditions. That lemma says that if the polynomial factors in , then it also factors in  as a product of primitive polynomials. Now any rational root  corresponds to a factor of degree 1 in  of the polynomial, and its primitive representative is then , assuming that  and  are coprime. But any multiple in  of  has leading term divisible by  and constant term divisible by , which proves the statement. This argument shows that more generally, any irreducible factor of  can be supposed to have integer coefficients, and leading and constant coefficients dividing the corresponding coefficients of  .             In the polynomial     : 2x3+x-1,     any rational root fully reduced would have to have a numerator that divides evenly into 1 and a denominator that divides evenly into 2. Hence the only possible rational roots are ±1/2 and ±1; since neither of these equates the polynomial to zero, it has no rational roots.       In the polynomial     : x3-7x+6     the only possible rational roots would have a numerator that divides 6 and a denominator that divides 1, limiting the possibilities to ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. Of these, 1, 2, and –3 equate the polynomial to zero, and hence are its rational roots.          Every rational root of the polynomial   : 3x3 - 5x2 + 5x - 2   must be among the numbers symbolically indicated by:   :           .   These 8 root candidates  can be tested by evaluating , for example using  |Horners_method|Horners_Method| . It turns out there is exactly one with .     This process may be made more efficient: if , it can be used to shorten the list of remaining candidates.  For example,  does not work, as . Substituting  yields a polynomial in   with constant term , while the coefficient of  remains the same as the coefficient of . Applying the rational root theorem thus yields the possible roots t  , so that     : x 1+t 2, 0,         True roots must occur on both lists, so list of rational root candidates has shrunk to just  and      If  rational roots are found, Horners method will also yield a polynomial of degree  .
