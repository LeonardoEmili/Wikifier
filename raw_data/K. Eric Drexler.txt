Kim Eric Drexler is an American engineer best known for seminal studies of the potential of  |molecular_nanotechnology|Molecular_Nanotechnology|  , from the 1970s and 1980s. His 1991 doctoral thesis at  |Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology|  was revised and published as the book Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery Manufacturing and Computation , which received the  |Association_of_American_Publishers|Association_Of_American_Publishers|  award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992.         K. Eric Drexler was strongly influenced by ideas on  |Limits_to_Growth|Limits_To_Growth|  in the early 1970s. During his first year at  |Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology|Massachusetts_Institute_Of_Technology| , he sought out someone who was working on extraterrestrial resources. He found  |Gerard_K_ONeill|Gerard_K_Oneill|  of  |Princeton_University|Princeton_University| , a physicist famous for his work on  |storage_rings|Storage_Ring|  for  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator|  and his landmark work on the concepts of  |space_colonization|Space_Colonization| . Drexler participated in NASA summer studies on space colonies in 1975 and 1976. He fabricated metal films a few tens of nanometers thick on a wax support to demonstrate the potentials of high performance  |solar_sails|Solar_Sails| . He was active in space politics, helping the  |L5_Society|L5_Society|  defeat the  |Moon_Treaty|Moon_Treaty|  in 1980. Besides working summers for ONeill, building  |mass_driver|Mass_Driver|  prototypes, Drexler delivered papers at the first three Space Manufacturing conferences at Princeton. The 1977 and 1979 papers were co-authored with  |Keith_Henson|Keith_Henson| , and patents were issued on both subjects, vapor phase fabrication and space radiators.     During the late 1970s, Drexler began to develop ideas about  |molecular_nanotechnology|Molecular_Nanotechnology|  . In 1979, he encountered  |Richard_Feynmans|Richard_Feynman|  provocative 1959 talk  |Theres_Plenty_of_Room_at_the_Bottom|Theres_Plenty_Of_Room_At_The_Bottom| . In 1981, Drexler wrote a seminal research article, published by  |PNAS|Pnas| , Molecular engineering: An approach to the development of general capabilities for molecular manipulation .  This article has continued to be cited, more than 620 times, during the following 35 years.      The term  |nano_technology|Nanotechnology|  had been coined by the Tokyo Science University professor  |Norio_Taniguchi|Norio_Taniguchi|  in 1974 to describe the precision manufacture of materials with nanometer tolerances, and Drexler unknowingly used a related term in his 1986 book  Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology  to describe what later became known as  |molecular_nanotechnology|Molecular_Nanotechnology|  . In that book, he proposed the idea of a nanoscale assembler which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity. He also first published the term  |grey_goo|Grey_Goo|  to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating molecular nanotechnology went out of control. He has subsequently tried to clarify his concerns about out-of-control self-replicators, and make the case that molecular manufacturing does not require such devices.      He is currently a research fellow at the  |Future_of_Humanity_Institute|Future_Of_Humanity_Institute|  where his focus is on superintelligence.          Drexler holds three degrees from  |MIT|Mit| . He received his  |B_S_|Bachelor_Of_Science|  in Interdisciplinary Sciences in 1977 and his  |M_S_|M_S_|  in 1979 in  |Astro_Aerospace_Engineering|Aerospace_Engineering|  with a Masters thesis titled Design of a High Performance Solar Sail System. In 1991, he earned a  |Ph_D_|Doctorate|  through the  |MIT_Media_Lab|Mit_Media_Lab|  after the department of electrical engineering and computer science refused to approve Drexlers plan of study.      His Ph.D. work was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and his thesis, Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation, was published as Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation , which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992.         Drexler was married to Christine Peterson for 21 years. The marriage ended in 2002.     In 2006, Drexler married Rosa Wang, a former investment banker who works with  |Ashoka_Innovators_for_the_Public|Ashoka_Innovators_For_The_Public|  on improving the social capital markets.            Drexlers work on nanotechnology was criticized as naive by Nobel Prize winner  |Richard_Smalley|Richard_Smalley|  in a 2001  Scientific American  article. Smalley first argued that fat fingers made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexlers assemblers and could only work in water. Drexler maintained that both were  |straw_man|Straw_Man|  arguments, and in the case of enzymes, wrote that Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, ... using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles  ...  Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, Chemical and Engineering news carried a four-part debate.   |Ray_Kurzweil|Ray_Kurzweil|  disputes Smalleys arguments. Ray Kurzweil, The Singularity Is Near, 2005     The  |National_Academies_of_Sciences_Engineering_and_Medicine|National_Academies_Of_Sciences_Engineering_And_Medicine| , in its 2006 review of the  |National_Nanotechnology_Initiative|National_Nanotechnology_Initiative| , argues that it is difficult to predict the future capabilities of nanotechnology:             Drexler is mentioned in  |Neal_Stephensons|Neal_Stephenson| |_science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  novel  The Diamond Age  as one of the heroes of a future world where nanotechnology is ubiquitous.      In the science fiction novel  Newtons Wake  by  |Ken_MacLeod|Ken_Macleod| , a drexler is a nanotech assembler of pretty much anything that can fit in the volume of the particular machineâ€”from socks to starships.      Drexler is also mentioned in the science fiction book  Decipher  by  |Stel_Pavlou|Stel_Pavlou| ; his book is mentioned as one of the starting points of the nanomachine construction, as well as giving a better understanding of the way  |carbon_60|Fullerene|  was to be applied.       |James_Rollins|James_Rollins|  references Drexlers Engines of Creation in his novel Excavation, using his theory of a molecular machine in two sections as a possible explanation for the mysterious Substance Z in the story.      Drexler gets a mention in the  |Timothy_Learys|Timothy_Leary|   Design for Dying  in the Mutation section, briefly detailing the  |8_circuit_model_of_consciousness|8_Circuit_Model_Of_Consciousness|  .      Drexler is mentioned in  |Doom_Patrol|Doom_Patrol|  57.      Drexler is mentioned in Michael Crichtons novel Prey in the introduction .      The Drexler Facility  of molecular nanotechnology research in  |Baldr_Sky|Baldr_Sky|  is named after him. The Assemblers is its key invention.
