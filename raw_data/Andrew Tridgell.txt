      Andrew Tridge Tridgell is an Australian  |computer_programmer|Computer_Programmer| . He is the author of and a contributor to the  |Samba|Samba| |_file_server|File_Server| , and co-inventor of the  |rsync|Rsync|  algorithm.     He has analysed complex  |proprietary_protocols|Proprietary_Protocol|  and algorithms, to allow compatible  |free_and_open_source_software|Free_And_Open_Source_Software|  implementations.       Tridgell was a major developer of the Samba software, analyzing the  |Server_Message_Block|Server_Message_Block|  protocol used for  |workgroup|Workgroup|  and network file sharing by  |Microsoft_Windows|Microsoft_Windows|  products. He developed the  |talloc|Talloc|  hierarchical memory allocator, originally as part of Samba.     For his PhD dissertation, he co-developed  |rsync|Rsync| , including the rsync algorithm, a highly efficient  |file_transfer|File_Transfer|  and  |synchronisation|File_Synchronization|  tool. He also was the original author of  |rzip|Rzip| , which uses a similar algorithm to rsync. He developed spamsum, based on  |locality_sensitive_hashing|Locality_Sensitive_Hashing|  algorithms.      He is the author of  |KnightCap|Knightcap| , a  |reinforcement_learning|Reinforcement_Learning|  based  |chess_engine|Chess_Engine| .     Tridgell was also a leader in  |hacking|Hacker|  the  |TiVo|Tivo|  to make it work in Australia, which uses the  |PAL|Pal|  video format.      In April 2005, Tridgell tried to produce free software  that interoperated with the  |BitKeeper|Bitkeeper|  source code repository. This was cited as the reason that BitMover revoked a license allowing  |Linux|Linux|  developers free use of their BitKeeper product.   |Linus_Torvalds|Linus_Torvalds| , the creator of the Linux kernel, and Tridgell were thus involved in a public debate about the events, in which Tridgell stated that, not having bought or owned BitKeeper – and thus having never agreed to its license – he could not violate it, and was analyzing the protocol ethically, as he had done with Samba. Tridgells involvement in the project resulted in Torvalds accusing him of playing dirty tricks with BitKeeper.  Tridgell claimed his analysis started with simply  |telnet|Telnet| ing to a BitKeeper server and typing help .      In 2011 Tridgell got involved with the software development of ArduPilot Mega, .

Retrieved on 19 September 2013.       Tridgell completed a PhD at the Computer Sciences Laboratory of the  |Australian_National_University|Australian_National_University| . His original doctorate work was in the area of  |speech_recognition|Speech_Recognition|  but was never completed. His submitted dissertation Efficient Algorithms for Sorting and Synchronization was based on his work on the  |rsync|Rsync|  algorithm.        In October 2003,  |The_Bulletin|The_Bulletin|  magazine judged Tridgell to be Australias smartest  |Information_and_Communications_Technology|Information_And_Communications_Technology|  person.       In July 2008, Tridgell was named Best Interoperator at the  |Google–OReilly_Open_Source_Awards|Google–Oreilly_Open_Source_Awards| , for his work on  |Samba|Samba|  and  |Rsync|Rsync| .    Tridgell  has been called a  |guru|Guru|  in its traditional Indian meaning by IT writer, Sam Varghese. , Sam Varghese,  |iTWire|Itwire| , 2007-12-25, accessed 27 September 2009   On 11 December 2018, Tridgell was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science  by the Australian National University, for authoring Samba, co-inventing rsync; and contributions to free and open source software.
