He is an only child; his parents, Warren Audrey Nesmith and  |Bette_Nesmith_Graham|Bette_Nesmith_Graham|  , divorced when their son was four. Bette Nesmith later remarried, marrying Robert Graham in 1962; they remained married until 1975. After Bettes father died in the early 1950s, he left property to her in  |Dallas|Dallas| ; Nesmith and his mother subsequently moved there to be closer to her family. To support herself as a single mother, Bette took temporary jobs ranging from clerical work to  |graphic_design|Graphic_Design| , eventually attaining the position of executive secretary at Texas Bank and Trust, the highest position open at that time to women in the industry. When Nesmith was thirteen, his mother invented the typewriter  |correction_fluid|Correction_Fluid|  later known commercially as  |Liquid_Paper|Liquid_Paper| . Over the next twenty-five years, she built the Liquid Paper Corporation into a multimillion-dollar international company, which she sold to  |Gillette|Gillette|  in 1979 for US$48 million. She died a few months later, aged fifty-six.

At fifteen, he was in the Dallas Theater Center teen program, where he was featured in several plays.     Without graduating from high school, Nesmith enlisted in the  |United_States_Air_Force|United_States_Air_Force|  in 1960. He completed basic training at  |Lackland_Air_Force_Base|Lackland_Air_Force_Base|  in  |San_Antonio|San_Antonio| , was trained as an aircraft mechanic at  |Sheppard_Air_Force_Base|Sheppard_Air_Force_Base|  in  |Wichita_Falls|Wichita_Falls| , Texas, and then was permanently stationed at the  |Clinton_Sherman_Air_Force_Base|Clinton_Sherman_Air_Force_Base| , near  |Burns_Flat_Oklahoma|Burns_Flat_Oklahoma| . While in the Air Force, Nesmith obtained a  |GED|General_Educational_Development|  and was discharged under honorable conditions in 1962. He enrolled in  |San_Antonio_College|San_Antonio_College| , a community college, where he met John Kuehne  and began a musical collaboration. The duo won the first San Antonio College talent award, performing a mixture of standard folk songs and a few of Nesmiths original songs. While in college, Nesmith began to write more songs and  |poetry|Poetry|  and after moving to  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| , began singing in folk clubs around the city. He served as the Hootmaster for the Monday night  |hootenannies|Hootenanny|  at  |The_Troubadour|The_Troubadour| , a West Hollywood nightclub that featured new artists. Nesmith performed with many different members of the burgeoning new LA music scene.  |Randy_Sparks|Randy_Sparks|  from the  |New_Christy_Minstrels|New_Christy_Minstrels|  offered Nesmith a publishing deal for his songs. It was during this time that Barry Friedman, aka the Rev.  |Frazier_Mohawk|Frazier_Mohawk| , showed him an ad for auditions for a new TV series,  The Monkees . In October 1965, Nesmith landed the role as the wool hat-wearing guitar player Mike in the show, which required real-life musical talent . The Monkees television series aired from 1966 until 1968, and has developed a cult following over the years. Sandoval, Andrew. Music Box Liner Notes: The True Story of The Monkees , Rhino Records, 2001       After a tour of duty in the Air Force, Nesmith was given a guitar as a Christmas present from his mother and stepfather. Learning as he went, he played solo and in a series of working bands, performing  |folk|Folk_Music| ,  |country|Country_Music| , and occasionally  |rock_and_roll|Rock_And_Roll| . His verse poems became the basis for song lyrics, and after moving to Los Angeles with Phyllis and friend John London, he signed a publishing deal for his songs. Nesmiths  |Mary_Mary|Mary_Mary|  was recorded by the  |Paul_Butterfield_Blues_Band|Paul_Butterfield| , while  |Different_Drum|Different_Drum|  and Some of Shellys Blues were recorded by  |Linda_Ronstadt|Linda_Ronstadt|  and the  |Stone_Poneys|Stone_Poneys| . Pretty Little Princess , written in 1965, was recorded by  |Frankie_Laine|Frankie_Laine|  and released as a single in 1968 on  |ABC_Records|Abc_Records| . Later, Some of Shellys Blues and Propinquity were made popular by the  |Nitty_Gritty_Dirt_Band|Nitty_Gritty_Dirt_Band|  on their 1970 album  Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy .     Nesmith began his recording career in 1963 by releasing a single on the Highness label. He followed this in 1965 with a one-off single released on Edan Records followed by two more recorded singles; one was titled The New Recruit under the name Michael Blessing , released on  |Colpix_Records|Colpix_Records| , coincidentally also the label of  |Davy_Jones|Davy_Jones| , though they did not meet until the Monkees formed.          From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band  |the_Monkees|The_Monkees| , created for the television  |situation_comedy_of_the_same_name|The_Monkees| . Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a  |wool_hat|Knit_Cap|  to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers  |Bob_Rafelson|Bob_Rafelson|  and  |Bert_Schneider|Bert_Schneider|  remembered the wool hat guy, and called Nesmith back.     Once he was cast,  |Screen_Gems|Screen_Gems|  bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees, such as The Girl I Knew Somewhere , Mary, Mary , and Listen to the Band , became minor hits. One song he wrote, You Just May Be the One , is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.     As part of a promotional deal,  |Gretsch|Gretsch|  guitar company built a one-off, natural-finish, 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was performing with the Monkees. The custom-made guitar was frequently cited at that time as being worth $5,000 , which was undoubtedly inflated for publicity purposes. He earlier played a customized Gretsch 12-string, which had originally been a six-string model. Nesmith used this guitar for his appearances on the television series, as well as the Monkees live appearances in 1966 and 1967. Beginning in 1968, Nesmith used a white six-string Gibson SG Custom for his live appearances with the Monkees. He used that guitar in their motion picture  Head  for the live version of Circle Sky , and also for the final original Monkees tour in 1969. In a post on his Facebook page in 2011, Nesmith reported that both guitars were stolen in the early 1970s.     As with the other Monkees, Nesmith came to be frustrated by the bands manufactured image. Nesmith was the most publicly vocal Monkee about the bands prefabricated image.      The Monkees succeeded in ousting supervisor  |Don_Kirshner|Don_Kirshner|  and took control of their records and song choices, but they worked as a four-man group on only one album, 1967s  Headquarters . Nesmith withheld many of his songs from the final Monkees albums, opting to release them on his post-Monkees solo records. During the bands first independent press conference, Nesmith called  More of The Monkees  probably the worst record in the history of the world . The band never regained its credibility after fans learned they had not played the instruments on their earlier records. Sales still continued to be profitable until the disastrous release of the movie Head.     Nesmiths last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for  |Kool_Aid|Kool_Aid|  and  |Nerf|Nerf|  balls in April 1970 . As the bands sales declined, Nesmith asked to be released from his contract, despite it costing him: I had three years left ... at $150,000 a year.  He remained in a financial bind until 1980, when he received his inheritance from the Liquid Paper Company. In a 1980 interview with  Playboy , he said of that time: I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture.           Nesmith did not participate in the Monkees 20th-anniversary reunion. However, he did appear during an encore with the other three members at the  |Greek_Theatre|Greek_Theatre|  on September 7, 1986. In a 1987 interview for  |Nick_Rocks|Nick_Rocks| , Nesmith stated, When Peter called up and said were going to go out, do you want to go? I was booked. But, if you get to L.A ... Ill play. Nick Rocks, January 1987 Profile of Michael Nesmith     Nesmith next joined his fellow Monkees band members for the 1986 Monkees Christmas Melody video for  |MTV|Mtv|  appearing throughout dressed/disguised as Santa Claus until the finale where he revealed his identity - and participation - to all.    Nesmith appeared again in 1989 with  |Dolenz|Micky_Dolenz| ,  |Tork|Peter_Tork|  and  |Jones|Davy_Jones| . Prior to the official kickoff of The Monkees 89 tour all four Monkees gathered in Los Angeles, California making two live radio appearances to promote their reunion concert at the Universal Amphitheatre where they appeared together as a foursome live on stage on July 9th. The following day all four band members were in attendance as the Monkees received a  |Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame|Hollywood_Walk_Of_Fame|  star.      In 1995, Nesmith was again reunited with the Monkees to record their studio album , titled  Justus , released in 1996. He also wrote and directed a Monkees television special,  Hey, Hey, Its the Monkees . To support the reunion, Nesmith, Jones, Dolenz and Tork briefly toured the UK in 1997. The UK tour was the last appearance of all four Monkees performing together.      In 2012, 2013 and 2014, after Joness  |death|Davy_Jones_Death| , Nesmith reunited with Dolenz and Tork to perform concerts throughout the United States.

When asked why he had decided to return to the Monkees, Nesmith stated, I never really left. It is a part of my youth that is always active in my thoughts and part of my overall work as an artist. It stays in a special place. Green, Andy, Q & A: Michael Nesmith on His Surprising Return to the Monkees , Rolling Stones Magazine, August 8, 2012     In 2016, Nesmith contributed vocally and instrumentally to the Monkees 50th anniversary album  Good Times! . He additionally contributed a song, I Know What I Know , and was reportedly thrilled at the outcome of the album.  Despite not touring with Dolenz and Tork for the majority of the Monkees 50th anniversary reunion in 2016, Nesmith did twice fill in for the ailing Peter Tork as well as appearing for the final show of the tour which featured all three surviving band members . At the end of the final show Nesmith announced his retirement from the Monkees, never to tour again.     In 2018, Nesmith and Dolenz toured together as a duo for the first time under the banner The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show . The tour was cut short four dates out due to Nesmith having health issues . He contributed two songs for the Monkees 13th studio album,  Christmas Party  , released on October 12, 2018.     In 2019, Nesmith and Dolenz reunited again to make up the cancelled dates of the tour and adding several more dates, including a forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand.       In 1969, Nesmith formed the group  |First_National_Band|First_National_Band|  with Kuehne,  |John_Ware|John_Ware| , and Red Rhodes. Nesmith wrote most of the songs for the band, including the single Joanne , which received some airplay and was a moderate chart hit for seven weeks during 1970, rising to number 21 on the Billboard Top 40. Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, p. 330 . The First National Band has been credited with being among the pioneers of country-rock music.      As he prepared for his exit from The Monkees in 1970, Nesmith was approached by John Ware of The Corvettes, a band that featured Nesmiths friend John London, who played on some of the earliest pre-Monkees Nesmith 45s, as well as numerous Monkees sessions, and had 45s produced by Nesmith for the  |Dot_label|Dot_Records|  in 1969. Ware wanted Nesmith to put together a band. Nesmith said he would be interested only if noted  |pedal_steel|Pedal_Steel_Guitar|  player  |Orville_Red_Rhodes|Red_Rhodes|  was part of the project; Nesmiths musical partnership with Rhodes continued until Rhodess death in 1995. The new band was christened Michael Nesmith and the First National Band and went on to record three albums for  |RCA_Records|Rca_Records|  in 1970.     Nesmith has been considered one of the pioneers of  |country_rock|Country_Rock| .  |Liner_notes|Liner_Notes|  from the CD Hillbilly Fever, Volume 5 released by  |Rhino_Entertainment|Rhino_Entertainment|  in 1995. He also had moderate commercial success with the First National Band. Their second single,  |Joanne|Joanne| , hit number 21 on the Billboard chart, number 17 on Cashbox, and number four in Canada, with the follow-up Silver Moon making number 42 Billboard, number 28 Cashbox, and number 13 in Canada. Two more singles charted , and the first two LPs charted in the lower regions of the Billboard album chart. No clear answer has ever been given for the bands breakup.     Nesmith followed up with The Second National Band, a band that, besides Nesmith, consisted of Michael Cohen , Johnny Meeks  , jazzer Jack Ranelli , and Orville Rhodes , as well as an appearance by singer, musician, and songwriter  |José_Feliciano|José_Feliciano|  on congas. The album,  Tantamount to Treason Vol. 1 , was a commercial and critical disaster. Nesmith then recorded  And the Hits Just Keep on Comin , featuring only him on guitar and Red Rhodes on pedal steel.          Nesmith became more heavily involved in producing, working on  |Iain_Matthewss|Iain_Matthews|  album  Valley Hi  and  |Bert_Janschs|Bert_Jansch|   L.A. Turnaround . Nesmith was given a label of his own, Countryside, through Elektra Records, as Elektras Jac Holzman was a fan of Nesmiths. It featured a number of artists produced by Nesmith, including Garland Frady and Red Rhodes. The staff band at Countryside also helped Nesmith on his next, and last, RCA album, Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash. Countryside folded when David Geffen replaced Holzman, as Countryside was unnecessary in Geffens eyes.     In the mid-1970s, Nesmith briefly collaborated as a songwriter with  |Linda_Hargrove|Linda_Hargrove| , resulting in the tune  |Ive_Never_Loved_Anyone_More|Ive_Never_Loved_Anyone_More|  , a hit for  |Lynn_Anderson|Lynn_Anderson|  and recorded by many others, as well as the songs Winonah and If You Will Walk With Me, both of which were recorded by Hargrove. Of these songs, only Winonah was recorded by Nesmith himself. During this same period, Nesmith started his multimedia company Pacific Arts, which initially put out audio records,  |eight_track|8_Track_Tape|  tapes, and cassettes, followed in 1981 with video records. Nesmith recorded a number of LPs for his label, and had a moderate worldwide hit in 1977 with his song Rio , the single taken from the album From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing. In 1983, Nesmith produced the music video for the  |Lionel_Richie|Lionel_Richie|  single  |All_Night_Long|All_Night_Long|  . In 1987, he produced the music video for the  |Michael_Jackson|Michael_Jackson|  single  |The_Way_You_Make_Me_Feel|The_Way_You_Make_Me_Feel|  .     PopClips and MTV, Elephant Parts and Television Parts     During this time, Nesmith created a video-clip for Rio , which helped spur Nesmiths creation of a television program called  PopClips  for the  |Nickelodeon|Nickelodeon|  cable network. In 1980, PopClips was sold to the  |Time_Warner|Time_Warner| / |Amex|American_Express|  consortium. Time Warner/Amex developed PopClips into the MTV network.     Nesmith won the first  |Grammy_Award|Grammy_Award_For_Video_Of_The_Year|  given for  |Music_Video|Grammy_Award_For_Video_Of_The_Year|  in 1982, for his hour-long  Elephant Parts  and also had a short-lived series on NBC inspired by the video called  Michael Nesmith in Television Parts . Television Parts included many other artists who were unknown at the time, but went on to become major stars in their own right.  |Jay_Leno|Jay_Leno| ,  |Jerry_Seinfeld|Jerry_Seinfeld| ,  |Garry_Shandling|Garry_Shandling| ,  |Whoopi_Goldberg|Whoopi_Goldberg| , and  |Arsenio_Hall|Arsenio_Hall|  all became well-known artists after their appearances on Nesmiths show. The concept of the show was to have comics render their stand-up routines into short comedy films much like the ones in Elephant Parts. Nesmith assembled writers  |Jack_Handey|Jack_Handey| ,  |William_Martin|William_E_Martin| , John Levenstein, and Michael Kaplan, along with directors  |William_Dear|William_Dear|   and Alan Myerson, as well as producer Ward Sylvester to create the show. The half-hour show ran for eight episodes in the summer of 1985 on NBC Thursday nights in prime time.            Nesmith formed the  |Pacific_Arts_Corporation|Pacific_Arts_Corporation| , Inc. in 1974 to manage and develop media projects. Pacific Arts Video became a pioneer in the  |home_video|Home_Video|  market, producing and distributing a wide variety of videotaped programs, although the company eventually ceased operations after an acrimonious contract dispute with  |PBS|Pbs|  over home video licensing rights and payments for several series, including  |Ken_Burns|Ken_Burns|   The Civil War . The dispute escalated into a lawsuit that went to jury trial in federal court in Los Angeles. On February 3, 1999, a jury awarded Nesmith and his company Pacific Arts $48.875  million in  |compensatory|Compensatory_Damages|  and  |punitive_damages|Punitive_Damages| , prompting his widely quoted comment, Its like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo. Youre happy to get your stereo back, but its sad to find out your grandmother is a thief. PBS appealed the ruling, but the appeal never reached court and a settlement was reached, with the amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith kept confidential.     Nesmiths current Pacific Arts project is Videoranch 3D, a virtual environment on the internet that hosts live performances at various virtual venues inside the ranch. He performed live inside Videoranch 3D on May 25, 2009.

In the early 1980s, Nesmith teamed with satirist  |P_J_ORourke|P_J_Orourke|  to ride his vehicle Timerider in the annual  |Baja_1000|Baja_1000|  off-road race. This is chronicled in ORourkes 2009 book  Driving Like Crazy .     During the 1990s, Nesmith, as trustee and president of the Gihon Foundation, hosted the Council on Ideas, a gathering of intellectuals from different fields who were asked to identify the most important issues of their day and publish the result.

In 2018, he announced that he would be doing a five-date tour of California with a revamped version of The First National Band, including a date at  |The_Troubadour|The_Troubadour| , where he performed before The Monkees.  On February 20, a tour was announced as The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show , their first tour as a duo. The pair will play Monkees music and promote the tour under the Monkees banner, but Nesmith stated, theres no pretense there about Micky and I being the Monkees. Were not.
