         Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin  was a  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik| |_revolutionary|Russian_Revolution| ,  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| |_politician|Politician|  and prolific  |author|Author|  on revolutionary theory.     As a young man, he spent six years in exile working closely with fellow exiles  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin|  and  |Leon_Trotsky|Leon_Trotsky| . After the  |revolution_of_February_1917|February_Revolution| , he returned to Moscow, where his Bolshevik credentials earned him a high rank in the Bolshevik party and after the  |October_Revolution|October_Revolution|  became editor of the party newspaper  Pravda .     Within the Bolshevik Party, Bukharin was initially a  |left_communist|Left_Communismrussian_Left_Communism| , but gradually moved from the left to the right from 1921. His strong support for and defence of the  |New_Economic_Policy|New_Economic_Policy|  eventually saw him lead the  |Right_Opposition|Right_Opposition| . By late 1924, this stance had positioned Bukharin favourably as  |Joseph_Stalins|Joseph_Stalin|  chief ally, with Bukharin soon elaborating Stalins new theory and policy of  |socialism_in_one_country|Socialism_In_One_Country| . Together, Bukharin and Stalin ousted Trotsky,  |Grigory_Zinoviev|Grigory_Zinoviev|  and  |Lev_Kamenev|Lev_Kamenev|  from the party at the  |XVth_Communist_Party_Congress|15Th_Congress_Of_The_All_Union_Communist_Party|  in December 1927. From 1926 to 1929, Bukharin enjoyed great power as General Secretary of the  |Cominterns|Comintern|  executive committee. However, Stalins decision to proceed with  |collectivisation|Collectivisation|  drove the two men apart and Bukharin was expelled from the Politburo in 1929.     When the  |Great_Purge|Great_Purge|  began in 1936, Stalin looked for any pretext to liquidate his former allies and rivals for power and some of Bukharins letters, conversations and tapped phone-calls indicated disloyalty. Arrested in February 1937, he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. After a  |show_trial|Show_Trial|  that alienated many Western communist sympathisers, he was executed in March 1938.       Nikolai Bukharin was born on September 27 , 1888, in  |Moscow|Moscow| . He was the second son of two schoolteachers, Ivan Gavrilovich Bukharin and Liubov Ivanovna Bukharina. His childhood is vividly recounted in his mostly autobiographic novel How It All Began.          Bukharins political life began at the age of sixteen with his lifelong friend  |Ilya_Ehrenburg|Ilya_Ehrenburg|  when he participated in student activities at  |Moscow_University|Moscow_University|  related to the  |Russian_Revolution_of_1905|Russian_Revolution_Of_1905| . He joined the  |Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party|Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party|  in 1906, becoming a member of the  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik|  faction. With  |Grigori_Sokolnikov|Grigori_Sokolnikov| , he convened the 1907 national youth conference in Moscow, which was later considered the founding of  |Komsomol|Komsomol| . By age thirty, he was a member of the Moscow Committee of the party. The committee was heavily infiltrated by the  |Tsarist|Tsarist|  secret police, the  |Okhrana|Okhrana| . As one of its leaders, Bukharin quickly became a person of interest to them. During this time, he became closely associated with  |Valerian_Obolensky|Valerian_Obolensky|  and  |Vladimir_Smirnov|Vladimir_Smirnov| , and also met his future first wife, Nadezhda Mikhailovna Lukina, his cousin and the sister of Nikolai Lukin, who was also a member of the party. They married soon after their exile, in 1911.     In 1911, after a brief imprisonment, Bukharin was exiled to  |Onega|Onega|  in  |Arkhangelsk|Arkhangelsk_Oblast|  but soon escaped to  |Hanover|Hanover| , where he stayed for a year before visiting  |Kraków|Kraków|  in 1912 to meet  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin|  for the first time. During the exile, he continued his education and wrote several books that established him as a major Bolshevik theorist in his 20s. His work,  Imperialism and World Economy  influenced Lenin, who freely borrowed from it Lenin wrote a preface to the book of Bukharin Imperialism and the World Economy .  in his larger and better-known work,  Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism . Nevertheless, he and Lenin often had hot disputes on theoretical issues and Bukharins closeness with the European Left and his  |anti_statist|Anti_Statist|  tendencies. Bukharin developed an interest in the works of Austrian  |Marxists|Marxist|  and non-Marxist economic theorists, such as  |Aleksandr_Bogdanov|Aleksandr_Bogdanov| , who deviated from  |Leninist|Leninist|  positions. Also, while in Vienna in 1913, he helped the  |Georgia|Georgia| n Bolshevik  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin|  write an article,  Marxism and the National Question , at Lenins request.     In October 1916, while based in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , he edited the newspaper  Novy Mir   with  |Leon_Trotsky|Leon_Trotsky|  and  |Alexandra_Kollontai|Alexandra_Kollontai| . When Trotsky arrived in New York in January 1917, Bukharin was the first to greet him .       At the news of the  |Russian_Revolution_of_February_1917|February_Revolution| , exiled revolutionaries from around the world began to flock back to the homeland. Trotsky left New York on March 27, 1917, sailing for St. Petersburg. Isaac Deutscher, The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879–1921 p. 246. Bukharin left New York in early April and returned to Russia by way of Japan , arriving in Moscow in early May 1917. Politically, the Bolsheviks in Moscow remained a definite minority to the  |Mensheviks|Mensheviks|  and Socialist Revolutionaries. However, as soldiers and workers began to be attracted to the Lenins promise to bring peace by withdrawing from the war, membership in the Bolshevik faction began to skyrocket—from 24,000 members in February 1917 to 200,000 members in October 1917. Upon his return to Moscow, Bukharin resumed his seat on the Moscow City Committee and also became a member of the Moscow Regional Bureau of the party.        To complicate matters further, the Bolsheviks themselves were divided into a right wing and a left wing. The right-wing of the Bolsheviks, including  |Aleksei_Rykov|Aleksei_Rykov|  and  |Viktor_Nogin|Viktor_Nogin| , controlled the Moscow Committee, while the younger left-wing Bolsheviks, including  |Vladimir_Smirnov|Vladimir_Smirnov| ,  |Valerian_Osinsky|Valerian_Osinsky| , Georgii Lomov, Nikolay Yakovlev, Ivan Kizelshtein and Ivan Stukov, were members of the Moscow Regional Bureau. On October 10, 1917, Bukharin, along with two other Moscow Bolsheviks:  |Andrei_Bubnov|Andrei_Bubnov|  and  |Grigori_Sokolnikov|Grigori_Sokolnikov|  were elected to the  |Central_Committee|Central_Committee_Of_The_Cpsu| . Leonard Shapiro, The Communist Party of the Soviet Union pp. 175 and 647. This strong representation on the Central Committee was a direct recognition of the fact that the Moscow Bureau had grown in importance. Whereas the Bolsheviks had previously been a minority in Moscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September 1917 the Bolsheviks were in the majority in Moscow. Furthermore, the Moscow Regional Bureau was formally responsible for the party organizations in each of the thirteen central provinces around Moscow—which accounted for 37% of the whole population of Russia and 20% of the Bolshevik membership.While no one dominated revolutionary politics in Moscow during the  |October_Revolution|October_Revolution|  as Trotsky did in St. Petersburg, Bukharin certainly was the most prominent leader in Moscow. During the October Revolution, Bukharin drafted, introduced, and defended the revolutionary decrees of the Moscow Soviet. Bukharin then represented the Moscow Soviet in their report to the revolutionary government in Petrograd. Following the October Revolution, Bukharin became the editor of the partys newspaper,  Pravda .     Bukharin believed passionately in the promise of  |world_revolution|World_Revolution| . In the Russian turmoil near the end of  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , when a negotiated peace with the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  was looming, he demanded a continuance of the war, fully expecting to incite all the foreign proletarian classes to arms.  Even as he was uncompromising toward Russias battlefield enemies, he also rejected any fraternization with the capitalist  |Allied_powers|Allies_Of_World_War_I| |Left_Communists|Left_Communismrussian_Left_Communism|  in bitter opposition to Lenins decision to sign the  |Treaty_of_Brest_Litovsk|Treaty_Of_Brest_Litovsk| . Rabinowitch, Alexander . The Bolsheviks in power: the first year of Soviet rule in Petrograd. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pp. 167, 174-175, 194 and passim. . At the crucial meeting of the  |CEC|All_Russian_Central_Executive_Committee|  convened at 3:00 AM, on 24 February 1918, few hours before the Gernan ultimatum was due to expire, Bukharin had the courage to break ranks and voted against accepting the treaty, while many other Left Communists either observed party discipline  or were simply no shows  . In this wartime power struggle, he was urged by some of his more fiery allies to have Lenin arrested. He rejected this idea immediately, but the issue would later become the basis of Stalinist charges against him, culminating in the show trial of 1938.      After the ratification of the treaty, Bukharin resumed his responsibilities within the party. In March 1919, he became a member of the Cominterns executive committee and a candidate member of the  |Politburo|Politburo_Of_The_Central_Committee_Of_The_Communist_Party_Of_The_Soviet_Union| . During the  |Civil_War|Russian_Civil_War|  period, he published several theoretical economic works, including the popular primer  The ABC of Communism  , and the more academic https://books.google.com/books?idER3-AQAAQBAJ & Economics of the Transitional Period and  .     By 1921, he changed his position and accepted Lenins emphasis on the survival and strengthening of the Soviet state as the bastion of the future world revolution. He became the foremost supporter of the  |New_Economic_Policy|New_Economic_Policy|  , to which he was to tie his political fortunes. Considered by the left communists as a retreat from socialist policies, the NEP reintroduced money, allowed private ownership and capitalistic practices in agriculture, retail trade, and light industry while the state retained control of heavy industry. While some have criticized Bukharin for this apparent U-turn, his change of emphasis can be partially explained by the necessity for peace and stability following seven years of war in Russia, and the failure of communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe, which ended the prospect of worldwide revolution.       After Lenins death in 1924, Bukharin became a full member of the Politburo. Stephen F. Cohen, Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution: A Political Biography, 1888-1938 In the subsequent power struggle among Leon Trotsky,  |Grigory_Zinoviev|Grigory_Zinoviev| ,  |Lev_Kamenev|Lev_Kamenev|  and Stalin, Bukharin allied himself with Stalin, who positioned himself as centrist of the Party and supported the NEP against the  |Left_Opposition|Left_Opposition| , which wanted more rapid industrialization, escalation of  |class_struggle|Class_Struggle|  against the  |kulaks|Kulak|  , and agitation for world revolution. It was Bukharin who formulated the thesis of  |Socialism_in_One_Country|Socialism_In_One_Country|  put forth by Stalin in 1924, which argued that  |socialism|Socialism|  could be developed in a single country, even one as underdeveloped as Russia. This new theory stated that revolution need no longer be encouraged in capitalist countries since Russia could and should achieve socialism alone. The thesis would become a hallmark of  |Stalinism|Stalinism| .     Trotsky, the prime force behind the Left Opposition, was defeated by a triumvirate formed by Stalin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev, with the support of Bukharin. At the  |Fourteenth_Party_Congress|14Th_Congress_Of_The_All_Union_Communist_Party|  in December 1925, Stalin openly attacked Kamenev and Zinoviev, revealing that they had asked for his aid in expelling Trotsky from the Party. By 1926, the Stalin-Bukharin alliance ousted Zinoviev and Kamenev from the Party leadership, and Bukharin enjoyed the highest degree of power during the 1926–1928 period. ,  TIME Magazine , October 25, 1926 He emerged as the leader of the Partys  |right_wing|Right_Opposition| , which included two other Politburo members  and he became General Secretary of the  |Cominterns|Communist_International|  executive committee in 1926. However, prompted by a grain shortage in 1928, Stalin reversed himself and proposed a program of rapid industrialization and forced  |collectivization|Collectivization|  because he believed that the NEP was not working fast enough. Stalin felt that in the new situation the policies of his former foes–Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev—were the right ones. Coehn, 1980      Bukharin was worried by the prospect of Stalins plan, which he feared would lead to “military-feudal exploitation” of the peasantry. Bukharin did want the Soviet Union to achieve industrialization but he preferred the more moderate approach of offering the peasants the opportunity to become prosperous, which would lead to greater grain production for sale abroad. Bukharin pressed his views throughout 1928 in meetings of the Politburo and at the Communist Party Congress, insisting that enforced grain requisition would be counterproductive, as War Communism had been a decade earlier. Paul R. Gregory, Politics, Murder, and Love in Stalins Kremlin: The Story of Nikolai Bukharin and Anna Larina ch 3-6       Bukharins support for the continuation of the NEP was not popular with higher Party cadres, and his slogan to peasants, Enrich yourselves! and proposal to achieve socialism at snails pace left him vulnerable to attacks first by Zinoviev and later by Stalin. Stalin attacked Bukharins views, portraying them as capitalist deviations and declaring that the revolution would be at risk without a strong policy that encouraged rapid industrialization.     Having helped Stalin achieve unchecked power against the Left Opposition, Bukharin found himself easily outmaneuvered by Stalin. Yet Bukharin played to Stalins strength by maintaining the appearance of unity within the Party leadership. Meanwhile, Stalin used his control of the Party machine to replace Bukharins supporters in the Rightist power base in Moscow, trade unions, and the Comintern.Bukharin attempted to gain support from earlier foes including Kamenev and Zinoviev who had fallen from power and held mid-level positions within the Communist party. The details of his meeting with Kamenev, to whom he confided that Stalin was Genghis Khan and changed policies to get rid of rivals, were leaked by the Trotskyist press and subjected him to accusations of factionalism. Eventually, Bukharin lost his position in the Comintern and the editorship of Pravda in April 1929 and he was expelled from the Politburo on 17 November of that year. Paul R. Gregory, Politics, Murder, and Love in Stalins Kremlin: The Story of Nikolai Bukharin and Anna Larina ch 17     Bukharin was forced to renounce his views under pressure. He wrote letters to Stalin pleading for forgiveness and rehabilitation, but through wiretaps of Bukharins private conversations with Stalins enemies, Stalin knew Bukharins repentance was insincere. Robert Service. Stalin: A Biography p 260.     International supporters of Bukharin,  |Jay_Lovestone|Jay_Lovestone|  of the  |Communist_Party_USA|Communist_Party_Usa|  among them, were also expelled from the Comintern. They formed an international alliance to promote their views, calling it the International Communist Opposition, though it became better known as the  |Right_Opposition|Right_Opposition| , after a term used by the Trotskyist Left Opposition in the Soviet Union to refer to Bukharin and his supporters there.       In the brief period of thaw in 1934–1936, Bukharin was politically rehabilitated and was made editor of  Izvestia  in 1934. There, he consistently highlighted the dangers of fascist regimes in Europe and the need for proletarian humanism . One of his first decisions as editor was to invite  |Boris_Pasternak|Boris_Pasternak|  to contribute to the newspaper and sit in on editorial meetings. Pasternak described Bukharin as a wonderful, historically extraordinary man, but fate has not been kind to him.  They first met during the lying-in-state of the Soviet police chief,  |Vyacheslav_Menzhinsky|Vyacheslav_Menzhinsky|  in May 1934, when Pasternak was seeking help for his fellow poet,  |Osip_Mandelstam|Osip_Mandelstam| , who had been arrested - though at that time neither Pasternak nor Bukharin knew why.      Bukharin had acted as Mandelstams political protector since 1922. According to Mandelstams wife, Nadezhda, M. owed him all the pleasant things in his life. His 1928 volume of poetry would never have come out without the active intervention of Bukharin. The journey to Armenia, our apartment and ration cards, contracts for future volumes - all this was arranged by Bukharin.  Bukharin wrote to Stalin, pleading clemency for Mandelstam, and appealed personally to the head of the  |NKVD|Nkvd| ,  |Genrikh_Yagoda|Genrikh_Yagoda| . It was Yagoda who told him about Mandelstams  |Stalin_Epigram|Stalin_Epigram| , after which he refused to have any further contact with Nadezhda Mandelstam, who had lied to him by denying that her husband had written anything rash .  - but continued to befriend Pasternak.     Soon after Mandelstams arrest, Bukharin was delegated to prepare the official report on poetry for the First Soviet Writers Congress, in August 1934. He could not any longer risk mentioning Mandelstam in his speech to the congress, but did devote a large section of his to Pasternak, whom he described as remote from current affairs...a singer of the old intelligensia...delicate and subtle...a wounded and easily vulnerable soul. He is the embodiment of chaste but self-absorbed laboratory craftsmanship...  His speech was greeted with wild applause, though it greatly offended some of the listeners, such as the communist poet  |Semyon_Kirsanov|Semyon_Kirsanov| , who complained: according to Bukharin, all the poets who have used their verses to participate in political life are out of date, but the others are not out of date, the so-called pure lyric poets.      When Bukharin was arrested two years later, Boris Pasternak displayed extraordinary courage by having a letter delivered to Bukharins wife saying that he was convinced of his innocence.        Stalins collectivization policy proved to be as disastrous as Bukharin predicted, but Stalin had by then achieved unchallenged authority in the party leadership. However, there were signs that moderates among Stalins supporters sought to end official terror and bring a general change in policy, after mass collectivization was largely completed and the worst was over. Although Bukharin had not challenged Stalin since 1929, his former supporters, including  |Martemyan_Ryutin|Martemyan_Ryutin| , drafted and clandestinely circulated an anti-Stalin platform, which called Stalin the evil genius of the Russian Revolution .     However,  |Sergey_Kirov|Sergey_Kirov| , First Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee was assassinated in Leningrad in December 1934, and his death was used by Stalin as a pretext to launch the  |Great_Purge|Great_Purge| , in which about a million people were to perish as Stalin eliminated all past and potential opposition to his authority. Nikolaevsky, Boris, The Kirov Assassination, The New Leader, 23 August 1941 Some historians believe that Kirovs assassination in 1934 was arranged by Stalin himself or at least that there is sufficient evidence to plausibly posit such a conclusion. Conquest, Robert. Stalin and the Kirov Murder. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 122–138, . After Kirovs assassination, the NKVD charged an ever-growing group of former oppositionists with Kirovs murder and other acts of treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage. A. Yakovlev, O dekabrskoi tragedii 1934 , Pravda, 28 January 1991, p. 3, cited in J. Arch Getty, The Politics of Repression Revisited , in ed., J. Arch Getty and Roberta T. Manning, Stalinist Terror: New Perspectives, New York, 1993, p. 46.          In February 1936, shortly before the purge started in earnest, Bukharin was sent to Paris by Stalin to negotiate the purchase of the Marx and Engels archives, held by the  |German_Social_Democratic_Party|German_Social_Democratic_Party|  before its dissolution by Hitler. He was joined by his young wife  |Anna_Larina|Anna_Larina| , which therefore opened the possibility of exile, but he decided against it, saying that he could not live outside the Soviet Union.     Bukharin, who had been forced to follow the Party line since 1929, confided to his old friends and former opponents his real view of Stalin and his policy. His conversations with  |Boris_Nicolaevsky|Boris_Nicolaevsky| , a Menshevik leader who held the manuscripts on behalf of the SPD, formed the basis of Letter of an Old Bolshevik , which was very influential in contemporary understanding of the period , although there are doubts about its authenticity.     According to Nicolaevsky, Bukharin spoke of the mass annihilation of completely defenseless men, with women and children under forced collectivization and liquidation of kulaks as a class that dehumanized the Party members with the profound psychological change in those communists who took part in the campaign. Instead of going mad, they accepted terror as a normal administrative method and regarded obedience to all orders from above as a supreme virtue. ... They are no longer human beings. They have truly become the cogs in a terrible machine. Nicolaevsky, Boris. Power and the Soviet Elite, New York, 1965, pp. 18–19.     Yet to another Menshevik leader,  |Fyodor_Dan|Fyodor_Dan| , he confided that Stalin became the man to whom the Party granted its confidence and is a sort of a symbol of the Party even though he is not a man, but a devil.  In Dans account, Bukharins acceptance of the Soviet Unions new direction was thus a result of his utter commitment to Party solidarity.     To  |André_Malraux|André_Malraux| , he also confided, Now he is going to kill me . To his boyhood friend, Ilya Ehrenburg, he expressed the suspicion that the whole trip was a trap set up by Stalin. Indeed, his contacts with Mensheviks during this trip were to feature prominently in his trial.            Following the trial and execution of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other leftist Old Bolsheviks in 1936, Bukharin and Rykov were arrested on 27 February 1937 following a plenum of the Central Committee and were charged with conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state.     Bukharin was tried in the  |Trial_of_the_Twenty_One|Case_Of_The_Anti_Soviet_Bloc_Of_Rights_And_Trotskyites|  on 2–13 March 1938 during the  |Great_Purge|Great_Purge| , along with ex-premier Alexei Rykov,  |Christian_Rakovsky|Christian_Rakovsky| ,  |Nikolai_Krestinsky|Nikolai_Krestinsky| , Genrikh Yagoda, and 16 other defendants alleged to belong to the so-called Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites . In a trial meant to be the culmination of previous  |show_trials|Moscow_Trials| , it was alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder  |Maxim_Gorky|Maxim_Gorky|  by poison, partition the Soviet Union and hand out her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain.     Even more than earlier Moscow show trials, Bukharins trial horrified many previously sympathetic observers as they watched allegations become more absurd than ever and the purge expand to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. For some prominent communists such as  |Bertram_Wolfe|Bertram_Wolfe| ,  |Jay_Lovestone|Jay_Lovestone| ,  |Arthur_Koestler|Arthur_Koestler| , and  |Heinrich_Brandler|Heinrich_Brandler| , the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism and even turned the first three into passionate anti-Communists eventually. Bertram David Wolfe, Breaking with communism , p. 10;  |Arthur_Koestler|Arthur_Koestler| , Darkness of Noon, p. 258.     While  |Anastas_Mikoyan|Anastas_Mikoyan|  and  |Vyacheslav_Molotov|Vyacheslav_Molotov|  later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured and his letters from prison do not give the suggestion that he was tortured, it is also known that his interrogators were instructed with the order: beating permitted . Bukharin held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with methods of physical influence wore him down. Orlando Figes, Revolutionary Russia, 1891-1991, Pelican Books, 2014, p. 273 But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators. Robert Conquest, The Great Terror: A Reassessment, pp. 364–65. Helen Rappaport, Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion p 31.     Bukharins confession and his motivation became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestlers acclaimed novel  Darkness at Noon  and a philosophical essay by  |Maurice_Merleau_Ponty|Maurice_Merleau_Ponty|  in Humanism and Terror. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to the sum total of crimes, he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in the written confession and refuse to go any further.     There are several interpretations of Bukharins motivations in the trial. Koestler and others viewed it as a true believers last service to the Party whereas Bukharin biographer Stephen Cohen and Robert Tucker saw traces of  |Aesopian_language|Aesopian_Language| , with which Bukharin sought to turn the table into an anti-trial of Stalinism . While his letters to Stalin – he wrote 34 very emotional and desperate letters tearfully protesting his innocence and professing his loyalty – suggest a complete capitulation and acceptance of his role in the trial, it contrasts with his actual conduct in the trial. Bukharin himself speaks of his peculiar duality of mind in his last plea, which led to semi-paralysis of the will and Hegelian  |unhappy_consciousness|Unhappy_Consciousness|  , which likely stemmed not only from his knowledge of the ruinous reality of Stalinism but also of the impending threat of fascism. Stephen J. Lee, Stalin and the Soviet Union p. 33     The result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him and saying that the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence in a trial that was solely based on confessions, he finished his last plea with the words:     the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all. Robert Tucker, Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet Block of Rights and Trotskyites , pp. 667–68.        The state prosecutor Vyshinsky characterized Bukharin as an accursed  |crossbreed|Crossbreed|  of fox and pig who supposedly committed a whole nightmare of vile crimes .     While in prison, he wrote at least four book-length manuscripts including a lyrical autobiographical novel, How It All Began, philosophical treatise Philosophical Arabesques, a collection of poems, and Socialism and Its Culture – all of which were found in Stalins archive and published in the 1990s.       Among other intercessors, the French author and  |Nobel_laureate|Nobel_Laureate| |_Romain_Rolland|Romain_Rolland|  wrote to Stalin seeking clemency, arguing that an intellect like that of Bukharin is a treasure for his country. He compared Bukharins situation to that of the great chemist  |Antoine_Lavoisier|Antoine_Lavoisier|  who was guillotined during the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| |Kommunarka_shooting_ground|Kommunarka_Shooting_Ground| , but the announcement of his death was overshadowed by the Nazi  |Anschluss|Anschluss|  of Austria.      According to Zhores and Roy Medvedev in The Unknown Stalin , Bukharins last message to Stalin stated Koba, why do you need me to die? , which was written in a note to Stalin just before his execution. Koba was Stalins  nom de guerre , and Bukharins use of it was a sign of how close the two had once been. The note was allegedly found still in Stalins desk after his death in 1953. Zhores A. Medvedev & Roy A. Medvedev, translated by Ellen Dahrendorf, The Unknown Stalin, I.B. Tauris, 2006, , 9781850439806, chapter 14, p. 296.     Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharins wife, Anna Larina, was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband officially  |rehabilitate|Rehabilitate| d by the Soviet state under  |Mikhail_Gorbachev|Mikhail_Gorbachev|  in 1988.             Bukharin was immensely popular within the party throughout the twenties and thirties, even after his fall from power. In his testament, Lenin portrayed him as the Golden Boy of the party, Westley, Christopher ,  |Mises_Institute|Mises_Institute| . writing:     Speaking of the young C.C. members, I wish to say a few words about Bukharin and Pyatakov. They are, in my opinion, the most outstanding figures , and the following must be borne in mind about them: Bukharin is not only a most valuable and major theorist of the Party; he is also rightly considered the favourite of the whole Party, but his theoretical views can be classified as fully Marxist only with great reserve, for there is something scholastic about him ... Both of these remarks, of course, are made only for the present, on the assumption that both these outstanding and devoted Party workers fail to find an occasion to enhance their knowledge and amend their one-sidedness.     Bukharin made several notable contributions to Marxist–Leninist thought, most notably The Economics of the Transition Period and his prison writings, Philosophical Arabesques, Monthly Review Press, 2005, , , as well as being a founding member of the Soviet Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a keen  |botanist|Botanist| . His primary contributions to economics were his critique of marginal utility theory, his analysis of imperialism, and his writings on the transition to communism in the Soviet Union. Philip Arestis A Biographical Dictionary of Dissenting Economists, p. 88.     His ideas, especially in economics and the question of market-socialism, later became highly influential in Chinese market-socialism and  |Deng_Xiaopings|Deng_Xiaoping|  reforms.     British author  |Martin_Amis|Martin_Amis|  argues that Bukharin was perhaps the only major Bolshevik to acknowledge moral hesitation by questioning, even in passing, the violence and sweeping reforms of the early Soviet Union.
