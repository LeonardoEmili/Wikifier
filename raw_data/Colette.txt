              Colette  was a French author and woman of letters nominated for the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature|  in 1948; also known as a  |mime|Mime_Artist| , actress, and journalist. Colette was most widely known for her 1944 novella  Gigi  , which was the basis for the  |1958_film|Gigi|  and the  |1973_stage_production|Gigi|  of the same name.         Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette was born on January 28, 1873, to war hero and tax collector Jules-Joseph Colette and his wife Adèle Eugénie Sidonie , née Landoy, in the village of  |Saint_Sauveur_en_Puisaye|Saint_Sauveur_En_Puisaye|  in the department of  |Yonne|Yonne| ,  |Burgundy|Burgundy| . The family was initially well off, but poor financial management substantially reduced the familys income, and Colette attended a public school from the ages of 6 to 17. She had a cousin, Genevieve, with whom she was particularly close.          In 1893, Colette married  |Henry_Gauthier_Villars|Henry_Gauthier_Villars|  , a well-known author and publisher who used the  |pen_name|Pen_Name|  Willy ,  and her first four novels – the four  |Claudine_stories_|Claudine| |_Claudine_à_lécole|Claudine_At_School|  , Claudine à Paris , Claudine en ménage , and Claudine sen va – appeared under his name. . The novels chart the coming of age and young adulthood of their titular heroine, Claudine, from an unconventional fifteen-year-old in a Burgundian village to a doyenne of the literary salons of turn-of-the-century Paris. The story they tell is semi-autobiographical – most strikingly, Claudine, unlike Colette, is motherless.     Willy, fourteen years older than his wife and one of the most notorious  |libertines|Libertine|  in Paris, introduced Colette into avant-garde intellectual and artistic circles, engaged in sexual affairs, and encouraged Colettes  |lesbian|Lesbianism|  alliances. It was he who chose the titillating subject matter of the Claudine novels: the secondary myth of  |Sappho|Sappho| ... the girls school or convent ruled by a seductive female teacher . Colette later said that she would never have become a writer if it had not been for Willy. Nevertheless, when Colette wished to have her name associated with her work as it became widely known, Willy resisted and locked her in her room until she produced enough pages to suit him.      Colette and Willy separated in 1906, although their divorce was not final until 1910. Colette had no access to the sizable earnings of the Claudine books – the copyright belonged to Willy – and until 1912 she initiated a stage career in music halls across France, sometimes playing Claudine in sketches from her own novels, earning barely enough to survive and often hungry and unwell. This period of her life is recalled in La Vagabonde , which deals with womens independence in a male society, a theme to which she would regularly return in future works. During these years she embarked on a series of relationships with other women, notably with  |Mathilde_de_Morny_the_Marquise_de_Belbeuf|Mathilde_De_Morny|  , with whom she sometimes shared the stage. On January 3, 1907, an onstage kiss between Missy and Colette in a pantomime entitled Rêve dÉgypte caused a near-riot, and as a result they were no longer able to live together openly, although their relationship continued for another five years.     In 1912, Colette married  |Henry_de_Jouvenel|Henry_De_Jouvenel| , the editor of  Le Matin . A daughter,  |Colette_de_Jouvenel|Colette_De_Jouvenel| , nicknamed Bel-Gazou, was born to them in 1913. During World War I Colette devoted herself to journalism. The marriage allowed her to devote her time to writing.Around this point in time she became an avid amateur photographer.            In 1920 Colette published  Chéri , portraying love between an older woman and a much younger man. Chéri is the lover of Léa, a wealthy  |courtesan|Courtesan| ; Léa is devastated when Chéri marries a girl his own age, and delighted when he returns to her, but after one final night together she sends him away again.     Colettes marriage to Jouvenel ended in divorce in 1924, due partly to his infidelities and partly to her affair with her 16-year-old stepson,  |Bertrand_de_Jouvenel|Bertrand_De_Jouvenel| . In 1925 she met Maurice Goudeket, who became her final husband; the couple stayed together until her death.     Colette was by then an established writer . The decades of the 1920s and 1930s were her most productive and innovative period. Set mostly in Burgundy or Paris during the  |Belle_Époque|Belle_Époque| , her work focused on married life and sexuality. It was frequently quasi-autobiographical:  Chéri  and Le Blé en Herbe both deal with love between an aging woman and a very young man, a situation reflecting her relationship with Bertrand de Jouvenel and with her third husband Goudeket, who was 16 years her junior. La Naissance du Jour is her explicit criticism of the conventional lives of women, expressed in a meditation on age and the renunciation of love by the character of her mother, Sido.     By this time Colette was frequently acclaimed as Frances greatest woman writer. It... has no plot, and yet tells of three lives all that should be known , wrote  |Janet_Flanner|Janet_Flanner|  of Sido . Once again, and at greater length than usual, she has been hailed for her genius, humanities and perfect prose by those literary journals which years ago... lifted nothing at all in her direction except the finger of scorn.        Colette was 67 years old when the Germans defeated and occupied France, and she remained in Paris, in her apartment in the  |Palais_Royal|Palais_Royal| . Her husband  |Maurice_Goudeket|Maurice_Goudeket| , who was Jewish, was arrested by the  |Gestapo|Gestapo|  in December 1941, and although he was released after a few months through the intervention of the French wife of the German ambassador, Colette lived through the rest of the war years with the anxiety of a possible second arrest. During the  |Occupation|German_Occupation_Of_France|  she produced two volumes of memoirs, Journal à Rebours and De ma Fenêtre . She wrote articles for several pro-Nazi newspapers  and her novel Julie de Carneilhan contains many anti-Semitic slurs.      In 1944 Colette published what became perhaps her most famous work,  Gigi , which tells the story of sixteen-year-old Gilberte Alvar. Born into a family of  |demimondaines|Demimonde| , Gigi is trained as a courtesan to captivate a wealthy lover, but defies the tradition by marrying him instead. In 1949 it was made into a French film starring  |Danièle_Delorme|Danièle_Delorme|  and  |Gaby_Morlay|Gaby_Morlay| , then in 1951 adapted for the stage with the then-unknown  |Audrey_Hepburn|Audrey_Hepburn|  in the title role, picked by Colette personally; the 1958 Hollywood musical movie, starring  |Leslie_Caron|Leslie_Caron|  and  |Louis_Jourdan|Louis_Jourdan| , with a screenplay by  |Alan_Jay_Lerner|Alan_Jay_Lerner|  and a score by Lerner and  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe| , won the Academy Award for Best Picture.     In the postwar years, Colette became a famous public figure, crippled by arthritis and cared for by Goudeket, who supervised the preparation of her Œuvres Complètes . She continued to write during those years, bringing out LEtoile Vesper and Le Fanal Bleu , in which she reflected on the problems of a writer whose inspiration is primarily autobiographical. She was nominated by  |Claude_Farrère|Claude_Farrère|  for the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Literature|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature|  in 1948.        On her death on August 3, 1954, she was refused a religious funeral by the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  on account of her  |divorces|Divorce| , but given a  |state_funeral|State_Funeral| , the first French  |woman_of_letters|Intellectualmanofletters|  to be granted the honour, and interred in  |Père_Lachaise|Père_Lachaise|  cemetery.

Kindle Edition          Colette was elected to the  |Belgian_Royal_Academy|The_Royal_Academies_For_Science_And_The_Arts_Of_Belgium|  , the  |Académie_Goncourt|Edmond_Louis_Antoine_Huot_De_Goncourt|  , and a Chevalier and Grand Officer of the  |Légion_dhonneur|Légion_Dhonneur| .     Colettes numerous biographers have proposed widely differing interpretations of her life and work over the decades.  Initially considered a limited if talented novelist , she has been increasingly recognised as an important voice in womens writing. Just before Colettes death,  |Katherine_Anne_Porter|Katherine_Anne_Porter|  wrote in the New York Times that Colette is the greatest living French writer of fiction; and that she was while Gide and Proust still lived.      Singer-songwriter  |Rosanne_Cash|Rosanne_Cash|  paid tribute to the writer in the song, The Summer I Read Colette, on her 1996 album  10 Song Demo .       |Truman_Capote|Truman_Capote|  wrote a short story about her in 1970 called The White Rose.      Lucette Stranded on the Island by  |Julia_Holter|Julia_Holter| , from her 2015 album  Have You in My Wilderness , is based on a minor character from Colettes short story Chance Acquaintances.      In the 1991 film Becoming Colette, Colette is played by the French actress  |Mathilda_May|Mathilda_May| . In the 2018 film  Colette , the title character is played by  |Keira_Knightley|Keira_Knightley| .  Both films focus on Colettes life in her twenties, her marriage to her first husband, and the publication of her first novels under his name.
