Sedimentation happens when the dispersed phase is denser than the continuous phase and the gravitational forces pull the denser globules towards the bottom of the emulsion.

Thermal methods are the most commonly used – these consist of increasing the emulsion temperature to accelerate destabilization .  Temperature affects not only the viscosity but also the interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or, on a broader scope, interactions between droplets within the system. Storing an emulsion at high temperatures enables the simulation of realistic conditions for a product , but also accelerates destabilization processes up to 200 times.     Mechanical methods of acceleration, including vibration, centrifugation, and agitation, can also be used.     These methods are almost always empirical, without a sound scientific basis.
