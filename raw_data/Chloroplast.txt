        Chloroplasts  are  |organelles|Organelle|  that conduct  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis| , where the photosynthetic pigment  |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll|  captures the  |energy|Energy|  from  |sunlight|Sunlight| , converts it, and stores it in the energy-storage molecules  |ATP|Adenosine_Triphosphate|  and  |NADPH|Nadph|  while freeing  |oxygen|Oxygen|  from water in  |plant|Plant_Cell|  and  |algal|Algae|  cells. They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  in a process known as the  |Calvin_cycle|Calvin_Cycle| . Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including  |fatty_acid_synthesis|Fatty_Acid_Synthesis| , much  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  synthesis, and the  |immune_response|Immune_Response|  in plants. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from one, in unicellular algae, up to 100 in plants like  Arabidopsis  and  |wheat|Wheat| .     A chloroplast is a type of organelle known as a  |plastid|Plastid| , characterized by  |its_two_membranes|Chloroplast_Membrane|  and a high concentration of  |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll| . Other plastid types, such as the  |leucoplast|Leucoplast|  and the  |chromoplast|Chromoplast| , contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis.     Chloroplasts are highly dynamic—they circulate and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally  |pinch_in_two|Division|  to reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity. Chloroplasts, like  |mitochondria|Mitochondria| , contain their own  |DNA|Dna| , which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic  |cyanobacterium|Cyanobacterium|  that was  |engulfed|Symbiogenesis|  by an early  |eukaryotic|Eukaryotic|  cell. Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.     With one exception , all chloroplasts can probably be traced back to a single  |endosymbiotic_event|Endosymbiotic_Event| , when a cyanobacterium was engulfed by the eukaryote. Despite this, chloroplasts can be found in an extremely wide set of organisms, some not even directly related to each other—a consequence of many  |secondary|Secondary_Endosymbiotic_Events|  and even  |tertiary_endosymbiotic_events|Tertiary_Endosymbiotic_Events| .     The word chloroplast is derived from the Greek words chloros , which means green, and plastes , which means the one who forms .             The first definitive description of a chloroplast  was given by  |Hugo_von_Mohl|Hugo_Von_Mohl|  in 1837 as discrete bodies within the green plant cell. von Mohl, H. . . Dissert. Tubingen 1835. Flora 1837, . In 1883,  |A_F_W_Schimper|A_F_W_Schimper|  would name these bodies as chloroplastids .  In 1884,  |Eduard_Strasburger|Eduard_Strasburger|  adopted the term chloroplasts .            Chloroplasts are one of many types of organelles in the plant cell. They are considered to have evolved from  |endosymbiotic|Endosymbiotic| |_cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria| .  |Mitochondria|Mitochondrion|  are thought to have come from a similar endosymbiosis event, where an  |aerobic|Aerobic_Organism| |_prokaryote|Prokaryote|  was engulfed. This origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the Russian biologist  |Konstantin_Mereschkowski|Konstantin_Mereschkowski|  in 1905  after  |Andreas_Schimper|Andreas_Franz_Wilhelm_Schimper|  observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble  |cyanobacteria|Cyanobacteria| . Chloroplasts are only found in  |plants|Plant| ,  |algae|Algae| ,  and the  |amoeboid|Amoeboid|   Paulinella chromatophora.          Chloroplasts are considered endosymbiotic Cyanobacteria.  Cyanobacteria are sometimes called blue-green  |algae|Algae|  even though they are  |prokaryotes|Prokaryote| . They are a diverse  |phylum|Phylum|  of  |bacteria|Bacteria|  capable of carrying out  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis| , and are  |gram_negative|Gram_Negative| , meaning that they have two cell membranes. Cyanobacteria also contain a  |peptidoglycan_cell_wall|Peptidoglycan_Cell_Wall| , which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria, and which is located between their two cell membranes.  Like chloroplasts, they have  |thylakoids|Thylakoid|  within. On the thylakoid membranes are  |photosynthetic_pigments|Photosynthetic_Pigments| , including  |chlorophyll_a|Chlorophyll_A| .  |Phycobilins|Phycobilins|  are also common cyanobacterial pigments, usually organized into hemispherical  |phycobilisomes|Phycobilisomes|  attached to the outside of the thylakoid membranes .                  Somewhere around 1 to 2 billion years ago,      a free-living  |cyanobacterium|Cyanobacterium|  entered an early  |eukaryotic|Eukaryotic|  cell, either as food or as an internal  |parasite|Parasite| , but managed to escape the  |phagocytic_vacuole|Phagocytic_Vacuole|  it was contained in. The two innermost  |lipid_bilayer_membranes|Cell_Membrane|   that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner  |membranes|Cell_Membrane|  of the ancestral cyanobacteriums  |gram_negative|Gram_Negative|  cell wall,    and not the  |phagosomal|Phagosomal|  membrane from the host, which was probably lost.   The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the  |nucleus|Nuclear_Genome|  of the host. From genomes that probably originally contained over 3000 genes only about 130 genes remain in the chloroplasts of contemporary plants. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast . Separately, somewhere around 500 million years ago, it happened again and led to the  |amoeboid|Amoeboid|   Paulinella chromatophora.     This event is called  endosymbiosis , or cell living inside another cell with a mutual benefit for both . The external cell is commonly referred to as the host while the internal cell is called the endosymbiont.     Chloroplasts are believed to have arisen after  |mitochondria|Mitochondrion| , since all  |eukaryotes|Eukaryotes|  contain mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts.   This is called  serial endosymbiosis —an early eukaryote engulfing the  |mitochondrion|Mitochondrion|  ancestor, and some descendants of it then engulfing the chloroplast ancestor, creating a cell with both chloroplasts and mitochondria.     Whether or not primary chloroplasts came from a single endosymbiotic event, or many independent engulfments across various eukaryotic lineages, has long been debated. It is now generally held that organisms with primary chloroplasts share  |a_single_ancestor|Monophyly|  that took in a  |cyanobacterium|Cyanobacterium|  600–2000 million years ago.  It has been proposed this the closest living relative of this bacterium is  Gloeomargarita lithophora .    The exception is the  |amoeboid|Amoeboid|   Paulinella chromatophora, which descends from an ancestor that took in a  Prochlorococcus   |cyanobacterium|Cyanobacterium|  90–500 million years ago.      These chloroplasts, which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor, are known as primary plastids  . All primary chloroplasts belong to one of four chloroplast lineages—the  |glaucophyte|Glaucophyte|  chloroplast lineage, the  |amoeboid|Amoeboid|   Paulinella chromatophora lineage, the  |rhodophyte|Rhodophyte|  chloroplast lineage, or the  |chloroplastidan|Chloroplastidan|  chloroplast lineage. The  |rhodophyte|Rhodophyte|  and  |chloroplastidan|Chloroplastidan|  lineages are the largest, with  |chloroplastidan|Chloroplastidan|  being the one that contains the  |land_plants|Land_Plants| .            Usually the endosymbiosis event is considered to have occurred in the  |Archaeplastida|Archaeplastida| , within which the  |glaucophyta|Glaucophyte|  being the possible earliest diverging lineage. The glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages, being found in only 13 species, and is thought to be the one that branched off the earliest. Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a  |peptidoglycan_wall|Peptidoglycan_Wall|  between their double membranes, like their  |cyanobacterial|Cyanobacteriametabolism_And_Organelles|  parent. For this reason, glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts . Glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain  |concentric|Concentric|  unstacked  |thylakoids|Thylakoid| , which surround a  |carboxysome|Carboxysome|  – an  |icosahedral|Icosahedral|  structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their  |carbon_fixation|Carbon_Fixation| |_enzyme|Enzyme| |_RuBisCO|Rubisco|  in. The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast. Like cyanobacteria, glaucophyte and rhodophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called  |phycobilisomes|Phycobilisomes| . For these reasons, glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in  |red_algae|Red_Algae|  and  |plants|Plants| .                    The  |rhodophyte|Rhodophyte| , or  |red_algal|Red_Algal|  chloroplast group is another large and diverse chloroplast lineage. Rhodophyte chloroplasts are also called rhodoplasts, literally red chloroplasts .      Rhodoplasts have a double membrane with an intermembrane space and  |phycobilin|Phycobilin|  pigments organized into  |phycobilisomes|Phycobilisome|  on the thylakoid membranes, preventing their thylakoids from stacking. Some contain  |pyrenoids|Pyrenoid| . Rhodoplasts have  |chlorophyll_a|Chlorophyll_A|  and  |phycobilins|Phycobilin|  for photosynthetic pigments; the phycobilin  |phycoerytherin|Phycoerytherin|  is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive  |red|Red|  color. However, since they also contain the blue-green  |chlorophyll_a|Chlorophyll_A|  and other pigments, many are reddish to purple from the combination. The red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help red algae catch more sunlight in deep water —as such, some red algae that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts, and can appear more greenish. Rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called  |floridean_starch|Floridean_Starch| , which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast, in the cytoplasm of the red alga.              The  |chloroplastidan|Chloroplastidan|  chloroplasts, or  |green|Green|  chloroplasts, are another large, highly diverse primary chloroplast lineage. Their host organisms are commonly known as the  |green_algae|Green_Algae|  and  |land_plants|Land_Plants| .  They differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their  |phycobilisomes|Phycobilisomes| , and contain  |chlorophyll_b|Chlorophyll_B|  instead. Most green chloroplasts are  |green|Green| , though some arent, like some forms of  Hæmatococcus pluvialis , due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls green colors. Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the  |peptidoglycan_wall|Peptidoglycan_Wall|  between their double membrane, leaving an intermembrane space. Some  |plants|Plants|  seem to have kept the  |genes|Genes|  for the synthesis of the  |peptidoglycan_layer|Peptidoglycan_Layer| , though theyve been repurposed for use in  |chloroplast_division|Chloroplastchloroplast_Division|  instead.      Most of the chloroplasts depicted in this article are green chloroplasts.     Green algae and plants keep their  |starch|Starch|  inside their chloroplasts, and in plants and some algae, the chloroplast thylakoids are arranged in grana stacks. Some green algal chloroplasts contain a structure called a  |pyrenoid|Pyrenoid| , which is functionally similar to the glaucophyte  |carboxysome|Carboxysome|  in that it is where  |RuBisCO|Rubisco|  and CO are concentrated in the chloroplast.            Helicosporidium  is a genus of nonphotosynthetic parasitic green algae that is thought to contain a vestigial chloroplast. Genes from a chloroplast  and nuclear genes indicating the presence of a chloroplast have been found in Helicosporidium even if nobodys seen the chloroplast itself.     Paulinella chromatophora  Paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently. It is not clear whether that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes. Being in the early stages of endosymbiosis, Paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved.   Paulinella cells contain one or two sausage shaped blue-green photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores, descended from the cyanobacterium  Synechococcus . Chromatophores cannot survive outside their host. Chromatophore DNA is about a million  |base_pairs|Base_Pairs|  long, containing around 850 protein encoding  |genes|Genes| —far less than the three million base pair Synechococcus genome, but much larger than the approximately 150,000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast. Chromatophores have transferred much less of their DNA to the nucleus of their host. About 0.3–0.8% of the nuclear DNA in Paulinella is from the chromatophore, compared with 11–14% from the chloroplast in plants.         Many other organisms obtained chloroplasts from the primary chloroplast lineages through secondary endosymbiosis—engulfing a red or green alga that contained a chloroplast. These chloroplasts are known as secondary plastids.     While primary chloroplasts have a double membrane from their  |cyanobacterial|Cyanobacterial|  ancestor, secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, as a result of the secondary endosymbiotic event, when a nonphotosynthetic  |eukaryote|Eukaryote|  engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it—much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story. The engulfed alga was broken down, leaving only its chloroplast, and sometimes its  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane|  and  |nucleus|Cell_Nucleus| , forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes  —the two cyanobacterial membranes, sometimes the eaten algas cell membrane, and the  |phagosomal_vacuole|Phagosomal_Vacuole|  from the hosts cell membrane.               The genes in the phagocytosed eukaryotes nucleus are often transferred to the secondary hosts nucleus.    |Cryptomonads|Cryptomonad|  and  |chlorarachniophytes|Chlorarachniophyte|  retain the phagocytosed eukaryotes nucleus, an object called a  |nucleomorph|Nucleomorph| , located between the second and third membranes of the chloroplast.     All secondary chloroplasts come from  |green|Green_Algae|  and  |red_algae|Red_Algae| —no secondary chloroplasts from  |glaucophytes|Glaucophytes|  have been observed, probably because glaucophytes are relatively rare in nature, making them less likely to have been taken up by another eukaryote.          |Green_algae|Green_Algae|  have been taken up by the  |euglenids|Euglenid| ,  |chlorarachniophytes|Chlorarachniophyte| , a lineage of  |dinoflagellates|Dinoflagellate| ,  and possibly the ancestor of the CASH lineage   in three or four separate engulfments.  Many green algal derived chloroplasts contain  |pyrenoids|Pyrenoid| , but unlike chloroplasts in their green algal ancestors, storage product collects in granules outside the chloroplast.           |flagellated|Flagellated| |_protists|Protists|  that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga.  |Euglenophyte|Euglenophyte|  chloroplasts have three membranes—it is thought that the membrane of the primary endosymbiont was lost, leaving the cyanobacterial membranes, and the secondary hosts phagosomal membrane. Euglenophyte chloroplasts have a  |pyrenoid|Pyrenoid|  and  |thylakoids|Thylakoid|  stacked in groups of three. Photosynthetic product is stored in the form of  |paramylon|Paramylon| , which is contained in membrane-bound granules in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte.           |Chlorarachniophytes|Chlorarachniophytes|   are a rare group of organisms that also contain chloroplasts derived from green algae, though their story is more complicated than that of the euglenophytes. The ancestor of chlorarachniophytes is thought to have been a eukaryote with a red algal derived chloroplast. It is then thought to have lost its first red algal chloroplast, and later engulfed a green alga, giving it its second, green algal derived chloroplast.     Chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts are bounded by four membranes, except near the cell membrane, where the chloroplast membranes fuse into a double membrane. Their thylakoids are arranged in loose stacks of three. Chlorarachniophytes have a form of polysaccharide called  |chrysolaminarin|Chrysolaminarin| , which they store in the cytoplasm, often collected around the chloroplast  |pyrenoid|Pyrenoid| , which bulges into the cytoplasm.     Chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts are notable because the green alga they are derived from has not been completely broken down—its nucleus still persists as a  |nucleomorph|Nucleomorph|  found between the second and third chloroplast membranes —the  |periplastid_space|Periplastid_Space| , which corresponds to the green algas cytoplasm.      Lepidodinium viride  and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast .  Lepidodinium  is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast thats not from the  |rhodoplast|Rhodoplast|  lineage. The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte  |nucleus|Cell_Nucleus| . The endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was  |serial_secondary_endosymbiosis|Serial_Secondary_Endosymbiosis|  rather than tertiary endosymbiosis—the endosymbiont was a  |green_alga|Green_Alga|  containing a primary chloroplast .          |Cryptophytes|Cryptomonad| , or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast. Cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the  |chlorarachniophytes|Chlorarachniophytes| . Cryptophyte chloroplasts have four membranes, the outermost of which is continuous with the  |rough_endoplasmic_reticulum|Rough_Endoplasmic_Reticulum| . They synthesize ordinary  |starch|Starch| , which is stored in granules found in the  |periplastid_space|Periplastid_Space| —outside the original double membrane, in the place that corresponds to the red algas cytoplasm. Inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a  |pyrenoid|Pyrenoid|  and  |thylakoids|Thylakoid|  in stacks of two.     Their chloroplasts do not have  |phycobilisomes|Phycobilisomes| , but they do have  |phycobilin_pigments|Phycobilin_Pigments|  which they keep in their thylakoid space, rather than anchored on the outside of their thylakoid membranes.     Cryptophytes may have played a key role in the spreading of red algal based chloroplasts.             |Haptophytes|Haptophytes|  are similar and closely related to cryptophytes or heterokontophytes. Their chloroplasts lack a nucleomorph, their thylakoids are in stacks of three, and they synthesize  |chrysolaminarin|Chrysolaminarin|  sugar, which they store completely outside of the chloroplast, in the cytoplasm of the haptophyte.        The  |heterokontophytes|Heterokontophytes| , also known as the stramenopiles, are a very large and diverse group of eukaryotes. The photoautotrophic lineage,  |Ochrophyta|Ochrophyta| , including the  |diatoms|Diatoms|  and the  |brown_algae|Brown_Algae| ,  |golden_algae|Golden_Algae| , and  |yellow_green_algae|Yellow_Green_Algae| , also contains red algal derived chloroplasts.     Heterokont chloroplasts are very similar to haptophyte chloroplasts, containing a  |pyrenoid|Pyrenoid| , triplet thylakoids, and with some exceptions, having four layer plastidic envelope, the outermost epiplastid membrane connected to the  |endoplasmic_reticulum|Endoplasmic_Reticulum| . Like haptophytes, heterokontophytes store sugar in  |chrysolaminarin|Chrysolaminarin|  granules in the cytoplasm. Heterokontophyte chloroplasts contain  |chlorophyll_a|Chlorophyll_A|  and with a few exceptions  |chlorophyll_c|Chlorophyll_C| , but also have  |carotenoids|Carotenoid|  which give them their many colors.               ;Apicomplexans    |Apicomplexans|Apicomplexans|  are a group of alveolates. Like the  |helicosproidia|Helicosproidia| , theyre parasitic, and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast. They were once thought to be related to the helicosproidia, but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than part of the CASH lineage. The apicomplexans include  Plasmodium , the  |malaria|Malaria|  parasite. Many apicomplexans keep a  |vestigial|Vestigial|  red algal derived chloroplast called an  |apicoplast|Apicoplast| , which they inherited from their ancestors. Other apicomplexans like  Cryptosporidium  have lost the chloroplast completely. Apicomplexans store their energy in  |amylopectin|Amylopectin|  granules that are located in their cytoplasm, even though they are nonphotosynthetic.     Apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function, and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids. They are bounded by four membranes, but the membranes are not connected to the  |endoplasmic_reticulum|Endoplasmic_Reticulum| . The fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis| .  |Plant|Plant|  chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar, and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize  |fatty_acids|Fatty_Acid| ,  |isopentenyl_pyrophosphate|Isopentenyl_Pyrophosphate| ,  |iron_sulfur_clusters|Iron_Sulfur_Clusters| , and carry out part of the  |heme|Heme|  pathway. This makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases. The most important apicoplast function is  |isopentenyl_pyrophosphate|Isopentenyl_Pyrophosphate|  synthesis—in fact, apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function, and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium, they dump the organelle.     ;Chromerids   The  |Chromerida|Chromerida|  is a newly discovered group of algae from Australian corals which comprises some close photosynthetic relatives of the apicomplexans. The first member,  Chromera velia , was discovered and first isolated in 2001. The discovery of Chromera velia with similar structure to the apicomplexanss, provides an important link in the evolutionary history of the apicomplexans and dinophytes. Their plastids have four membranes, lack chlorophyll c and use the type II form of  |RuBisCO|Rubisco|  obtained from a horizontal transfer event.      ;Dinophytes   The  |dinoflagellates|Dinoflagellates|  are yet another very large and diverse group of  |protists|Protists| , around half of which are   |photosynthetic|Photosynthetic| .      Most dinophyte chloroplasts are secondary  |red_algal|Red_Algae|  derived chloroplasts. Many other dinophytes have lost the chloroplast , or replaced it though tertiary endosymbiosis  —the engulfment of another eukaryotic algae containing a red algal derived chloroplast. Others replaced their original chloroplast with a  |green_algal|Green_Algae|  derived one.     Most dinophyte chloroplasts contain form II RuBisCO, at least the  |photosynthetic_pigments|Photosynthetic_Pigments| |_chlorophyll_a|Chlorophyll_A| ,  |chlorophyll_c_2_|Chlorophyll_C2| ,  |beta_carotene|Beta_Carotene| , and at least one dinophyte-unique  |xanthophyll|Xanthophyll|  , giving many a golden-brown color. All dinophytes store starch in their cytoplasm, and most have chloroplasts with thylakoids arranged in stacks of three.          The most common dinophyte chloroplast is the  |peridinin|Peridinin| -type chloroplast, characterized by the  |carotenoid|Carotenoid|  pigment  |peridinin|Peridinin|  in their chloroplasts, along with  |chlorophyll_a|Chlorophyll_A|  and  |chlorophyll_c_2_|Chlorophyll_C2| . Peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts. The peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes , having lost the red algal endosymbionts original cell membrane. The outermost membrane is not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum. They contain a  |pyrenoid|Pyrenoid| , and have triplet-stacked thylakoids. Starch is found outside the chloroplast. An important feature of these chloroplasts is that their  |chloroplast_DNA|Chloroplast_Dna|  is highly  |reduced|Genome_Reduction|  and fragmented into many small circles. Most of the genome has migrated to the nucleus, and only critical photosynthesis-related genes remain in the chloroplast.     The peridinin chloroplast is thought to be the dinophytes original chloroplast, which has been lost, reduced, replaced, or has company in several other dinophyte lineages.          The  |fucoxanthin|Fucoxanthin|  dinophyte lineages  lost their original red algal derived chloroplast, and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a  |haptophyte|Haptophyte|  endosymbiont.  Karlodinium  and  Karenia  probably took up different heterokontophytes. Because the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes, tertiary endosymbiosis would be expected to create a six membraned chloroplast, adding the haptophytes  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane|  and the dinophytes  |phagosomal_vacuole|Phagosomal_Vacuole| . However, the haptophyte was heavily reduced, stripped of a few membranes and its nucleus, leaving only its chloroplast , and possibly one or two additional membranes around it.      Fucoxanthin-containing chloroplasts are characterized by having the pigment  |fucoxanthin|Fucoxanthin|   and no peridinin. Fucoxanthin is also found in haptophyte chloroplasts, providing evidence of ancestry.           Kryptoperidinium  and  Durinskia  have a  |diatom|Diatom|   derived chloroplast. These chloroplasts are bounded by up to five membranes, . The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original  |mitochondria|Mitochondrion| , and has  |endoplasmic_reticulum|Endoplasmic_Reticulum| ,  |ribosomes|Ribosome| , a  |nucleus|Cell_Nucleus| , and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete  |cell|Cell| ,  all inside the hosts  |endoplasmic_reticulum_lumen|Endoplasmic_Reticulum_Lumen| . However the diatom endosymbiont cant store its own food—its storage polysaccharide is found in granules in the dinophyte hosts cytoplasm instead. The diatom endosymbionts nucleus is present, but it probably cant be called a  |nucleomorph|Nucleomorph|  because it shows no sign of  |genome_reduction|Genome_Reduction| , and might have even been expanded. Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.     The diatom endosymbiont is bounded by a single membrane, inside it are chloroplasts with four membranes. Like the diatom endosymbionts diatom ancestor, the chloroplasts have triplet thylakoids and  |pyrenoids|Pyrenoid| .     In some of these  |genera|Genera| , the diatom endosymbionts chloroplasts arent the only chloroplasts in the dinophyte. The original three-membraned peridinin chloroplast is still around, converted to an  |eyespot|Eyespot_Apparatus| .            In some groups of  |mixotrophic|Mixotrophic| |protists|Protist| , like some  |dinoflagellates|Dinoflagellate|  , chloroplasts are separated from a captured alga and used temporarily. These  |klepto_chloroplasts|Kleptoplasty|  may only have a lifetime of a few days and are then replaced.           Members of the genus  Dinophysis  have a  |phycobilin|Phycobilin| -containing chloroplast taken from a  |cryptophyte|Cryptomonad| . However, the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont—only the chloroplast seems to have been taken, and the chloroplast has been stripped of its  |nucleomorph|Nucleomorph|  and outermost two membranes, leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast. Cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to maintain themselves, and Dinophysis species grown in  |cell_culture|Cell_Culture|  alone cannot survive, so it is possible that the Dinophysis chloroplast is a  |kleptoplast|Kleptoplast| —if so, Dinophysis chloroplasts wear out and Dinophysis species must continually engulf cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts to replace the old ones.               Chloroplasts have their own  |DNA|Chloroplast_Dna| ,  often abbreviated as ctDNA,  or cpDNA.  It is also known as the  |plastome|Plastome| . Its existence was first proved in 1962,  and first sequenced in 1986—when two Japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast DNA of  |liverwort|Liverwort|  and  |tobacco|Tobacco_Plant| .  Since then, hundreds of chloroplast DNAs from various species have been  |sequenced|Dna_Sequencing| , but they are mostly those of  |land_plants|Land_Plants|  and  |green_algae|Green_Algae| — |glaucophytes|Glaucophytes| ,  |red_algae|Red_Algae| , and other algal groups are extremely underrepresented, potentially introducing some  |bias|Selection_Bias|  in views of typical chloroplast DNA structure and content.             With few exceptions, most chloroplasts have their entire chloroplast genome combined into a single large circular DNA molecule, typically 120,000–170,000  |base_pairs|Base_Pairs|  long.  They can have a contour length of around 30–60 micrometers, and have a mass of about 80–130 million  |daltons|Dalton| .      While usually thought of as a circular molecule, there is some evidence that chloroplast DNA molecules more often take on a  |linear|Linear|  shape.        Many chloroplast DNAs contain two inverted repeats, which separate a long single copy section from a short single copy section .    While a given pair of inverted repeats are rarely completely identical, they are always very similar to each other, apparently resulting from  |concerted_evolution|Concerted_Evolution| .     The inverted repeats vary wildly in length, ranging from 4,000 to 25,000  |base_pairs|Base_Pairs|  long each and containing as few as four or as many as over 150 genes. Inverted repeats in plants tend to be at the upper end of this range, each being 20,000–25,000 base pairs long.      The inverted repeat regions are highly  |conserved|Conserved_Sequence|  among land plants, and accumulate few mutations. Similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages , suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some chloroplast DNAs have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats . It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.          New chloroplasts may contain up to 100 copies of their DNA, though the number of chloroplast DNA copies decreases to about 15–20 as the chloroplasts age.  They are usually packed into  |nucleoids|Nucleoid| , which can contain several identical chloroplast DNA rings. Many nucleoids can be found in each chloroplast.   In primitive  |red_algae|Red_Algae| , the chloroplast DNA nucleoids are clustered in the center of the chloroplast, while in green plants and  |green_algae|Green_Algae| , the nucleoids are dispersed throughout the  |stroma|Stroma| .     Though chloroplast DNA is not associated with true  |histones|Histone| , in  |red_algae|Red_Algae| , similar proteins that tightly pack each chloroplast DNA ring into a  |nucleoid|Nucleoid|  have been found.          In chloroplasts of the moss  Physcomitrella patens , the  |DNA_mismatch_repair|Dna_Mismatch_Repair|  protein Msh1 interacts with the  |recombination|Homologous_Recombination| al  |repair|Dna_Repair|  proteins  |RecA|Reca|  and RecG to maintain chloroplast  |genome|Genome|  stability.  In chloroplasts of the plant  Arabidopsis thaliana  the  |RecA|Reca|  protein maintains the integrity of the chloroplasts DNA by a process that likely involves the recombinational repair of  |DNA_damage|Dna_Damage| .               The mechanism for chloroplast DNA replication has not been conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via  |electron_microscopy|Electron_Microscopy|  since the 1970s.   The results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop . As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.     In addition to the early microscopy experiments, this model is also supported by the amounts of  |deamination|Deamination|  seen in cpDNA. Deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes  |hypoxanthine|Hypoxanthine| . Hypoxanthine can bind to cytosine, and when the XC base pair is replicated, it becomes a GC .     ref name Krishnan / ref name Krishnan / ref name The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA /  ref name The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA / ref name pmid4580243  /ref ref name The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA / ref name The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA / ref name The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA /  !--border: 1px rgba solid;--  .
