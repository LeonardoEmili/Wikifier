     Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions  is an  |Internet_standard|Internet_Standard|  that extends the format of  |email|Email|  messages to support text in  |character_sets|Character_Set|  other than  |ASCII|Ascii| , as well attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs. Message bodies may consist of multiple parts, and header information may be specified in non-ASCII character sets. Email messages with MIME formatting are typically transmitted with standard protocols, such as the  |Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol|Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol|  , the  |Post_Office_Protocol|Post_Office_Protocol|  , and the  |Internet_Message_Access_Protocol|Internet_Message_Access_Protocol|  .     The MIME standard is specified in a series of  |requests_for_comments|Request_For_Comments| ,   ,   ,   ,    and   . The integration with SMTP email is specified in    and   .     Although the MIME formalism was designed mainly for SMTP, its content types are also important in other  |communication_protocols|Protocol| . In the  |HyperText_Transfer_Protocol|Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol|  for the  |World_Wide_Web|World_Wide_Web| , servers insert a MIME header field at the beginning of any Web transmission. Clients use the  |content_type|Content_Type|  or  |media_type|Media_Type|  header to select an appropriate viewer application for the type of data indicated. Browsers typically contain GIF and JPEG image viewers.           The presence of this header field indicates the message is MIME-formatted. The value is typically 1.0 . The field appears as follows:   MIME-Version: 1.0     According to MIME co-creator  |Nathaniel_Borenstein|Nathaniel_Borenstein| , the version number was introduced to permit changes to the MIME protocol in subsequent versions. However, Borenstein admitted short-comings in the specification that hindered the implementation of this feature:  We did not adequately specify how to handle a future MIME version. ... So if you write something that knows 1.0, what should you do if you encounter 2.0 or 1.1? I sort of thought it was obvious but it turned out everyone implemented that in different ways. And the result is that it would be just about impossible for the Internet to ever define a 2.0 or a 1.1.         This header field indicates the  |media_type|Media_Type|  of the message content, consisting of a type and subtype, for example   Content-Type: text/plain     Through the use of the multipart type, MIME allows mail messages to have parts arranged in a  |tree_structure|Tree_Structure|  where the leaf nodes are any non-multipart content type and the non-leaf nodes are any of a variety of multipart types.   This mechanism supports:   simple text messages using text/plain   text plus attachments . A MIME message including an attached file generally indicates the files original name with the Content-disposition: field, so that the type of file is indicated both by the MIME content-type and the   |filename_extension|Filename_Extension|  multipart/mixed with a text/plain part and the original message as a message/rfc822 partmultipart/alternative with the same content in text/plain and text/html formsfor example, image/jpeg, audio/mp3, video/mp4, and application/msword and so onRFC 1341, since made obsolete by RFC 2045e.g. UTF-8 |mputi|Mputi| codes 13 and 10 respectivelyRFC 6152codes 13 and 10 respectivelyRFC 3030with their associated inefficiencyRFC 2047the charset separated by CRLF SPACE ? for example Subject    .
