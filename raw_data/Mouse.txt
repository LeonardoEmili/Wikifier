               A mouse, plural mice, is a small  |rodent|Rodent|  characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, and a high breeding rate. The best known mouse species is the common  |house_mouse|House_Mouse|  . It is also a popular  |pet|Pet| . In some places, certain kinds of  |field_mice|Apodemus|  are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.     Species of mice are mostly classified in Rodentia, and are present throughout the order. Typical mice are classified in the genus  |Mus|Mus| .     Mice are typically distinguished from  |rats|Rat|  by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a smaller  |muroid|Muroid|  rodent, its  |common_name|Common_Name|  includes the term mouse, while if it is larger, the name includes the term rat. Common terms rat and mouse are not  |taxonomically|Taxonomy|  specific. Scientifically, the term mouse is not confined to members of Mus for example, but includes such as the  |deer_mouse_Peromyscus|Deer_Mouse| .      |Domestic_mice|Fancy_Mouse|  sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain, the white  |lab_mouse|Laboratory_Mouse| , has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research.      |Cats|Cat| , wild  |dogs|Dog| ,  |fox|Fox| es,  |birds_of_prey|Bird_Of_Prey| ,  |snakes|Snake|  and even certain kinds of  |arthropods|Arthropod|  have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of its remarkable adaptability to almost any  |environment|Ecological_Niche| , the mouse is one of the most successful  |mammalian|Mammalian|  genera living on  |Earth|Earth|  today.     Mice, in certain contexts, can be considered  |vermin|Vermin|  which are a major source of  |crop|Crops|  damage,  causing structural damage and spreading  |diseases|Disease|  through their  |parasites|Parasitism|  and  |feces|Feces| .  In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to  |hantavirus|Hantavirus| , which may lead to  |hantavirus_pulmonary_syndrome|Hantavirus_Pulmonary_Syndrome|  .     Primarily  |nocturnal|Nocturnality|   animals, mice compensate for their poor eyesight with a keen sense of hearing, and rely especially on their sense of smell to locate food and avoid predators.      Mice build long intricate burrows in the wild. These typically have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels or routes. In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.        order  |Dasyuromorphia|Dasyuromorphia| |_marsupial_mice|Marsupial_Mice| , smaller species of  |Dasyuridae|Dasyuridae| |_Rodentia|Rodentia| |_Castorimorpha|Castorimorpha| |_Heteromyidae|Heteromyidae| |_Kangaroo_mouse|Kangaroo_Mouse| , genus  Microdipodops   |Pocket_mouse|Pocket_Mouse| , tribe  |Perognathinae|Perognathinae| |_Spiny_pocket_mouse|Spiny_Pocket_Mouse| , genus  Heteromys   |Anomaluromorpha|Anomaluromorpha| |_Anomaluridae|Anomaluridae| |_flying_mouse|Flying_Mouse| |_Myomorpha|Myomorpha| |_Cricetidae|Cricetidae| |_Brush_mouse|Brush_Mouse| , Peromyscus boylii  |Florida_mouse|Florida_Mouse| |_Golden_mouse|Golden_Mouse| |_Harvest_mouse|Harvest_Mouse| , genus  Reithrodontomys   |Muridae|Muridae|   Mus   Apodemus   |Wood_mouse|Wood_Mouse| , Apodemus sylvaticus  |Yellow_necked_mouse|Yellow_Necked_Mouse| , Apodemus flavicollis  |Large_Mindoro_forest_mouse|Large_Mindoro_Forest_Mouse| |_Big_eared_hopping_mouse|Big_Eared_Hopping_Mouse| |_Luzon_montane_forest_mouse|Luzon_Montane_Forest_Mouse| |_Forrests_mouse|Forrests_Mouse| |_Pebble_mound_mouse|Pebble_Mound_Mouse| |_Bolams_mouse|Bolams_Mouse| |_Harvest_mouse|Harvest_Mouse| , genus  Micromys                Mice are common  |experiment|Experiment| al animals in laboratory research of  |biology|Biology|  and  |psychology|Psychology|  fields primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of  |homology|Homology|  with humans. They are the most commonly used  |mammal|Mammal| ian  |model_organism|Model_Organism| , more common than  |rats|Rats| . The mouse  |genome|Genome|  has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse  |genes|Gene|  have human homologs. The mouse has approximately 2.7 billion base pairs and 20 pairs of chromosomes.    They can also be manipulated in ways that are illegal with humans, although  |animal_rights|Animal_Rights|  activists often object. A  |knockout_mouse|Knockout_Mouse|  is a  |genetically_modified_mouse|Genetically_Modified_Mouse|  that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a  |gene_knockout|Gene_Knockout| .     Reasons for common selection of mice are that they are small and inexpensive, have a widely varied diet, are easily maintained, and can reproduce quickly. Several  |generations|Generation|  of mice can be observed in a relatively short time. Mice are generally very docile if raised from birth and given sufficient human contact. However, certain strains have been known to be quite temperamental. Mice and rats have the same organs in the same places, with the difference of size.             Many people buy mice as companion pets. They can be playful, loving and can grow used to being handled. Like pet rats, pet mice should not be left unsupervised outside as they have many natural predators, including birds, snakes, lizards, cats, and dogs. Male mice tend to have a stronger odor than the females. However, mice are careful groomers and as pets they never need bathing. Well looked-after mice can make ideal pets. Some common mouse care products are:    |Cage|Fancy_Mousecaging|  – Usually a  |hamster|Hamster|  or  |gerbil|Gerbil| |_cage|Cage| , but a variety of special mouse cages are now available. Most should have a secure door.     |Food|Mouse_Food|  – Special pelleted and seed-based food is available. Mice can generally eat most rodent food   Bedding – Usually made of hardwood pulp, such as  |aspen|Aspen| , sometimes from shredded, un |ink|Ink| ed  |paper|Paper|  or recycled virgin  |wood_pulp|Wood_Pulp| . Using  |corn_husk|Corn_Husk|  bedding is avoided because it promotes  Aspergillus   |fungus|Fungus| , and can grow  |mold|Mold|  once it gets wet, which is rough on their feet.       In nature, mice are largely  |herbivores|Herbivore| , consuming any kind of fruit or grain from plants.  However, mice adapt well to urban areas and are known for eating almost all types of food scraps. In captivity, mice are commonly fed commercial pelleted mouse diet. These diets are nutritionally complete, but they still need a large variety of vegetables.          Mice are a staple in the diet of many small  |carnivores|Carnivores| . Humans have eaten mice since  |prehistoric|Prehistoric|  times and still eat them as a delicacy throughout eastern  |Zambia|Zambia|  and northern  |Malawi|Malawi| ,  where they are a seasonal source of  |protein|Protein| . Mice are no longer routinely consumed by humans elsewhere. However, in Victorian Britain, fried mice were still given to children as a folk remedy for  |bed_wetting|Enuresis| ;  |Flora_Thompson|Flora_Thompson| , Lark Rise to Candleford p. 504 while  |Jared_Diamond|Jared_Diamond|  reports creamed mice being used in England as a dietary supplement during W. W. II rationing. J Diamond, The World until Yesterday p. 314     Prescribed cures in Ancient Egypt included mice as medicine.  In Ancient Egypt, when infants were ill, mice were eaten as treatment by their mothers.   It was believed that mouse eating by the mother would help heal the baby who was ill.          In various countries mice are used as food  , Canberra Exotic Pets / reptilesinc.com.au, accessed 14 November 2009 for pets such as  |snakes|Snakes| ,  |lizards|Lizards| ,  |frogs|Frogs| ,  |tarantulas|Tarantulas|  and  |birds_of_prey|Bird_Of_Prey| , and many pet stores carry mice for this purpose.     Common terms used to refer to different ages/sizes of mice when sold for pet food are pinkies , fuzzies , crawlers , hoppers , and adults .  Pinkies are newborn mice that have not yet grown fur; fuzzies have some fur but are not very mobile; hoppers have a full coat of hair and are fully mobile but are smaller than adult mice. Mice without fur are easier for the animal to consume; however, mice with fur may be more convincing as animal feed. These terms are also used to refer to the various growth stages of  |rats|Rat|   .
