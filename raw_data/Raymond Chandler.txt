Chandler, Raymond . Trouble Is My Business. Vintage Books, 1988, About the Author .     Chandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature. He is considered to be a founder of the  |hard_boiled|Hard_Boiled|  school of detective fiction, along with  |Dashiell_Hammett|Dashiell_Hammett| ,  |James_M_Cain|James_M_Cain|  and other Black Mask writers. The  |protagonist|Protagonist|  of his novels,  |Philip_Marlowe|Philip_Marlowe| , like Hammetts  |Sam_Spade|Sam_Spade| , is considered by some to be synonymous with private detective . Both were played in films by  |Humphrey_Bogart|Humphrey_Bogart| , whom many consider to be the quintessential Marlowe.     At least three of Chandlers novels have been regarded as masterpieces:  Farewell, My Lovely  ,  The Little Sister  , and  The Long Goodbye  . The Long Goodbye was praised in an anthology of American crime stories as arguably the first book since Hammetts The Glass Key, published more than twenty years earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery . Chandlers reputation has grown in recent years. Pronzini, p. 169,            Chandler was born in 1888 in  |Chicago|Chicago| , the son of Florence Dart and Maurice Benjamin Chandler.  He spent his early years in  |Plattsmouth_Nebraska|Plattsmouth_Nebraska| , living with his mother and father near his cousins and his aunt and uncle.  Chandlers father, an alcoholic civil engineer who worked for the railway, abandoned the family. To obtain the best possible education for Ray, his mother, originally from Ireland, moved them to the area of  |Upper_Norwood|Upper_Norwood|  in what is now the London Borough of  |Croydon|Croydon|   in 1900.  Another uncle, a successful lawyer in  |Waterford|Waterford| , Ireland, supported them    while they lived with Chandlers maternal grandmother. Raymond was a first cousin to the actor  |Max_Adrian|Max_Adrian| , a founder member of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Maxs mother Mabel was a sister of Florence Thornton. Chandler was classically educated at  |Dulwich_College|Dulwich_College| , London . He spent some of his childhood summers in Waterford with his mothers family.  He did not go to university, instead spending time in Paris and  |Munich|Munich|  improving his foreign language skills. In 1907, he was naturalized as a  |British_subject|British_Subject|  in order to take the  |civil_service|Her_Majestys_Civil_Service|  examination, which he passed. He then took an  |Admiralty|Admiralty|  job, lasting just over a year. His first poem was published during that time.     Chandler disliked the servility of the civil service and resigned, to the consternation of his family, and became a reporter for the  Daily Express  and the Bristol  Western Gazette  newspapers. He was unsuccessful as a journalist, but he published reviews and continued writing  |romantic|Romanticism|  poetry. An encounter with the slightly older  |Richard_Barham_Middleton|Richard_Barham_Middleton|  is said to have influenced him into postponing his career as writer. I met... also a young, bearded, and sad-eyed man called Richard Middleton.  ... Shortly afterwards he committed suicide in Antwerp, a suicide of despair, I should say. The incident made a great impression on me, because Middleton struck me as having far more talent than I was ever likely to possess; and if he couldnt make a go of it, it wasnt very likely that I could. Accounting for that time he said, Of course in those days as now there were...clever young men who made a decent living as freelances for the numerous literary weeklies , but I was distinctly not a clever young man. Nor was I at all a happy young man.      In 1912, he borrowed money from his Waterford uncle, who expected it to be repaid with interest, and returned to America, visiting his aunt and uncle before settling in San Francisco for a time, where he took a correspondence course in bookkeeping, finishing ahead of schedule. His mother joined him there in late 1912. They moved to Los Angeles in 1913,  where he strung tennis rackets, picked fruit and endured a time of scrimping and saving. He found steady employment with the Los Angeles Creamery. In 1917 he travelled to Vancouver where in August he enlisted in the  |Canadian_Expeditionary_Force|Canadian_Expeditionary_Force| . He saw combat in the trenches in France with the  |Gordon_Highlanders|Gordon_Highlanders| , was twice hospitalized with  |Spanish_flu|Spanish_Flu|  during the pandemic  and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  when the war ended.     After the  |armistice|Armistice_With_Germany| , he returned to Los Angeles by way of Canada, and soon began a love affair with Pearl Eugenie Pascal, a married woman 18 years his senior and the stepmother of Gordon Pascal, with whom Chandler had enlisted. Cissy amicably divorced her husband, Julian, in 1920, but Chandlers mother disapproved of the relationship and refused to sanction the marriage. For the next four years Chandler supported both his mother and Cissy. After the death of Florence Chandler on September 26, 1923, he was free to marry Cissy. They were married on February 6, 1924. s Shamus Town Timeline and Residences pages using official government sources . Having begun in 1922 as a bookkeeper and auditor, Chandler was by 1931 a highly paid vice president of the  |Dabney_Oil_Syndicate|Dabney_Oil_Syndicate| , but his alcoholism, absenteeism, promiscuity with female employees, and threatened suicides contributed to his dismissal a year later.          In straitened financial circumstances during the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression| , Chandler turned to his latent writing talent to earn a living, teaching himself to write  |pulp_fiction|Pulp_Magazine|  by studying the  |Perry_Mason|Perry_Mason|  stories of  |Erle_Stanley_Gardner|Erle_Stanley_Gardner| . Chandlers first professional work, Blackmailers Dont Shoot , was published in Black Mask magazine in 1933. According to genre historian Herbert Ruhm, Chandler, who worked slowly and painstakingly, revising again and again, had taken five months to write the story. Erle Stanley Gardner could turn out a pulp story in three or four days  and turned out an estimated one thousand. Herbert Ruhm, Introduction , in Herbert Ruhm , ed., The Hard-boiled Detective: Stories from Black Mask Magazine, 1920-1951, New York: Vintage, p. xvii.     His first novel,  The Big Sleep , was published in 1939, featuring the detective Philip Marlowe, speaking in the first person. In 1950, Chandler described in a letter to his English publisher, Hamish Hamilton, why he began reading pulp magazines and later wrote for them:     Wandering up and down the Pacific Coast in an automobile I began to read pulp magazines, because they were cheap enough to throw away and because I never had at any time any taste for the kind of thing which is known as womens magazines. This was in the great days of the Black Mask and it struck me that some of the writing was pretty forceful and honest, even though it had its crude aspect. I decided that this might be a good way to try to learn to write fiction and get paid a small amount of money at the same time. I spent five months over an 18,000 word novelette and sold it for $180. After that I never looked back, although I had a good many uneasy periods looking forward. Chandler, Raymond . p. vii.     His second Marlowe novel,  Farewell, My Lovely  , became the basis for three movie versions adapted by other screenwriters, including the  |1944|1944_In_Film|  film  Murder My Sweet , which marked the screen debut of the Marlowe character, played by  |Dick_Powell|Dick_Powell|  . Literary success and film adaptations led to a demand for Chandler himself as a screenwriter. He and  |Billy_Wilder|Billy_Wilder|  co-wrote  Double Indemnity  , based on  |James_M_Cains|James_M_Cain| |_novel_of_the_same_title|Double_Indemnity| . The  |noir|Film_Noir|  screenplay was nominated for an  |Academy_Award|Academy_Award| . Said Wilder, I would just guide the structure and I would also do a lot of the dialogue, and he would then comprehend and start constructing too. Wilder acknowledged that the dialogue which makes the film so memorable was largely Chandlers.     Chandlers only produced original screenplay was  The Blue Dahlia  . He had not written a  |denouement|Denouement|  for the script and, according to producer  |John_Houseman|John_Houseman| , Chandler agreed to complete the script only if drunk, which Houseman agreed to. The script gained Chandlers second Academy Award nomination for screenplay.     Chandler collaborated on the screenplay of  |Alfred_Hitchcocks|Alfred_Hitchcock|   Strangers on a Train  , an ironic murder story based on  |Patricia_Highsmiths|Patricia_Highsmith| |_novel|Strangers_On_A_Train| , which he thought implausible. Chandler clashed with Hitchcock to such an extent that they stopped talking, especially after Hitchcock heard Chandler had referred to him as that fat bastard . Hitchcock reportedly made a show of throwing Chandlers two draft screenplays into the studio trash can while holding his nose, but Chandler retained the lead screenwriting credit along with Czenzi Ormonde.     In 1946 the Chandlers moved to  |La_Jolla|La_Jolla| , California, an affluent coastal neighborhood of San Diego, where Chandler wrote two more Philip Marlowe novels, The Long Goodbye and his last completed work, Playback. The latter was derived from an unproduced courtroom drama screenplay he had written for  |Universal_Studios|Universal_Studios| .     Four chapters of a novel, unfinished at his death, were transformed into a final Philip Marlowe novel,  Poodle Springs , by the mystery writer and Chandler admirer  |Robert_B_Parker|Robert_B_Parker| , in 1989. Parker shares the authorship with Chandler. Parker subsequently wrote a sequel to The Big Sleep entitled  Perchance to Dream , which was salted with quotes from the original novel. Chandlers final Marlowe short story, circa 1957, was entitled The Pencil . It later provided the basis of an episode of the HBO miniseries ,  Philip Marlowe, Private Eye , starring Powers Boothe as Marlowe.     In 2014, The Princess and the Pedlar , a previously unknown comic operetta, with libretto by Chandler and music by Julian Pascal, was discovered    among the uncatalogued holdings of the  |Library_of_Congress|Library_Of_Congress| . The work was never published or produced. It has been dismissed by the Raymond Chandler estate as no more than… a curiosity.  A small team under the direction of the actor and director  |Paul_Sand|Paul_Sand|  is seeking permission to produce the operetta in Los Angeles.       Cissy Chandler died in 1954, after a long illness. Heartbroken and drunk, Chandler neglected to inter her cremated remains, and they sat for 57 years in a storage locker in the basement of Cypress View Mausoleum.     After Cissys death, Chandlers loneliness worsened his propensity for  |clinical_depression|Clinical_Depression| ; he returned to drinking alcohol, never quitting it for long, and the quality and quantity of his writing suffered. In 1955, he attempted suicide. In The Long Embrace: Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved, Judith Freeman says it was a cry for help, given that he called the police beforehand, saying he planned to kill himself. Chandlers personal and professional life were both helped and complicated by the women to whom he was attracted—notably Helga Greene, his literary agent; Jean Fracasse, his secretary;  |Sonia_Orwell|Sonia_Brownell|  ; and  |Natasha_Spender|Natasha_Spender|  . Chandler regained his U.S. citizenship in 1956.     After a respite in England, he returned to La Jolla. He died at Scripps Memorial Hospital of pneumonial peripheral vascular shock and prerenal uremia in 1959. Helga Greene inherited Chandlers $60,000 estate, after prevailing in a 1960 lawsuit filed by Fracasse contesting Chandlers  |holographic|Holographic_Will| |_codicil|Codicil|  to his will.     Chandler is buried at  |Mount_Hope_Cemetery|Mount_Hope_Cemetery| , in San Diego, California. As Frank MacShane noted in his biography, The Life of Raymond Chandler, Chandler wished to be cremated and placed next to Cissy in Cypress View Mausoleum. Instead, he was buried in Mount Hope, because he had left no funeral or burial instructions. Hiney . pp. 275–276.     In 2010, Chandler historian Loren Latker, with the assistance of attorney Aissa Wayne , brought a petition to disinter Cissys remains and reinter them with Chandler in Mount Hope. After a hearing in September 2010 in  |San_Diego_Superior_Court|Superior_Courts_Of_California| , Judge Richard S. Whitney entered an order granting Latkers request. Bell, Diane . .

On February 14, 2011, Cissys ashes were conveyed from Cypress View to Mount Hope and interred under a new grave marker above Chandlers, as they had wished. Bell, Diane . . SignOnSanDiego.com. Retrieved 2011-11-26. About 100 people attended the ceremony, which included readings by the Rev. Randal Gardner,  |Powers_Boothe|Powers_Boothe| , Judith Freeman and Aissa Wayne. The shared gravestone reads, Dead men are heavier than broken hearts , a quotation from The Big Sleep. Chandlers original gravestone, placed by Jean Fracasse, is still at the head of his grave; the new one is at the foot.       In his introduction to Trouble Is My Business , a collection of four of his short stories, Chandler provided insight on the formula for the detective story and how the pulp magazines differed from previous detective stories:          Chandler also described the struggle that writers of pulp fiction had in following the formula demanded by the editors of the pulp magazines:            Critics and writers, including  |W_H_Auden|W_H_Auden| ,  |Evelyn_Waugh|Evelyn_Waugh|  and  |Ian_Fleming|Ian_Fleming| , greatly admired Chandlers prose. In a radio discussion with Chandler, Fleming said that Chandler offered some of the finest dialogue written in any prose today .  Contemporary mystery writer  |Paul_Levine|Paul_Levine|  has described Chandlers style as the literary equivalent of a quick punch to the gut.  Chandlers swift-moving, hardboiled style was inspired mostly by Dashiell Hammett, but his sharp and lyrical  |similes|Simile|  are original: The muzzle of the  |Luger|Luger_P08_Pistol|  looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel ; He had a heart as big as one of  |Mae_Wests|Mae_West|  hips ; Dead men are heavier than broken hearts ; I went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor. Chandlers writing redefined the  |private_eye|Private_Investigator|  fiction genre, led to the coining of the adjective Chandleresque, and inevitably became the subject of parody and  |pastiche|Pastiche| . Yet the detective Philip Marlowe is not a stereotypical tough guy, but a complex, sometimes sentimental man with few friends, who attended university, who speaks some  |Spanish|Spanish_Language|  and sometimes admires Mexicans, and who is a student of chess and classical music. He is a man who refuses a prospective clients fee for a job he considers unethical.     The high regard in which Chandler is generally held today is in contrast to the critical sniping that stung the author during his lifetime. In a March 1942 letter to Blanche Knopf, published in Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler, he wrote, The thing that rather gets me down is that when I write something that is tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, I get panned for being tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, and then when I try to tone down a bit and develop the mental and emotional side of a situation, I get panned for leaving out what I was panned for putting in the first time.     Although his work enjoys general acclaim today, Chandler has been criticized for certain aspects of his writing. The  Washington Post  reviewer Patrick Anderson described his plots as rambling at best and incoherent at worst  and criticized Chandlers treatment of black, female, and homosexual characters, calling him a rather nasty man at times . Woods, Paula L.  The Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on September 8, 2017.     Sante, Luc. Rising Crime. The New York Times, The New York Times, February 17, 2007, www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/books/review/Sante.t.html?mcubz3.

Playback  is the only one of his novels not to have been cinematically adapted. Arguably the most notable adaptation is  The Big Sleep  , by  |Howard_Hawks|Howard_Hawks| , with  |Humphrey_Bogart|Humphrey_Bogart|  as Philip Marlowe.  |William_Faulkner|William_Faulkner|  was a co-writer of the screenplay. Chandlers few screenwriting efforts and the cinematic adaptation of his novels proved stylistically and thematically influential on the American film noir genre. Notable for its revised take on both the Marlowe character, transplanting the novel to the 1970s, is  |Robert_Altmans|Robert_Altman|  1973 neo-noir adaptation of  The Long Goodbye .     Chandler was also a perceptive critic of detective fiction; his essay  |The_Simple_Art_of_Murder|The_Simple_Art_Of_Murder|  is the canonical essay in the field.       In the 11th issue of the influential  |Cyberpunk|Cyberpunk|  fanzine  Cheap Truth ,  |Vincent_Omniaveritas|Bruce_Sterling|  conducted a fictitious interview with Chandler. The interview opines that Chandlers views towards the potential for respectability in pulp and genre fiction could also be applied to Science Fiction, specifically the Cyberpunk movement. Sterling, Bruce . Raymond Chandler Interview . Cheap Truth. Retrieved 2018-01-02. It also derides Chandlers now-famous 1953 caricature of pulp Science Fiction.    In the 2012 documentary, The Doors: Mr. Mojo Risin- The Story Of L.A. Woman, keyboardist, Ray Manzarack describes Jim Morrisons L.A.
