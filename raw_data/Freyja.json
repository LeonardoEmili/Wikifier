The dwarfs said that they had no lack of money, and that for the necklace the only thing she could offer them would be a night with each of them. Whether she liked it better or worse , Freyja agreed to the conditions, and so spent a night with each of the four dwarfs. The conditions were fulfilled and the necklace was hers. Freyja went home to her bower as if nothing happened.     As related in chapter 2, Loki, under the service of Odin, found out about Freyjas actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the necklace and bring it to him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyjas bower against her will, this wouldnt be an easy task, yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyjas bower but found it locked, and that he couldnt enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.     Having made his way into Freyjas chambers, Loki looked around to be sure that no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep.

She got dressed and went to Odin. She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, and that he should give her back her jewelry.     Odin said that, given how she obtained it, she would never get it back. That is, with one exception: she could have it back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again.

These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally the one who chooses the slain.

These observations became an extremely common observation in works regarding Old Norse religion until at least the early 1990s. In her book-length study of scholarship on the topic of Freyja, Britt-Mari Näsström is highly critical of this deduction; Näsström says that these parallels are due to sheer ignorance about the characteristics of Cybele; scholars have not troubled to look into the resemblances and differences between the two goddesses, if any, in support for their arguments for a common origin.
