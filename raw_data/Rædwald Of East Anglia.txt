     Rædwald , also written as Raedwald or Redwald, was a  |king_of_East_Anglia|List_Of_Monarchs_Of_East_Anglia| , an  |Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxons|  kingdom which included the present-day English counties of  |Norfolk|Norfolk|  and  |Suffolk|Suffolk| . He was the son of  |Tytila_of_East_Anglia|Tytila_Of_East_Anglia|  and a member of the  |Wuffingas|Wuffingas|  dynasty , who were the first kings of the  |East_Angles|Kingdom_Of_East_Anglia| . Details about Rædwalds reign are scarce, primarily because the  |Viking|Viking|  invasions of the 9th century destroyed the  |monasteries|Monastery|  in East Anglia where many documents would have been kept. Rædwald reigned from about 599 until his death around 624, initially under the overlordship of  |Æthelberht_of_Kent|Æthelberht_Of_Kent| . In 616, as a result of fighting the Battle of the River Idle and defeating  |Æthelfrith_of_Northumbria|Æthelfrith_Of_Northumbria| , he was able to install  |Edwin|Edwin_Of_Northumbria| , who was acquiescent to his authority, as the new king of  |Northumbria|Northumbria| . During the battle, both Æthelfrith and Rædwalds son Rægenhere were killed.     From around 616, Rædwald was the most powerful of the English kings south of the  |River_Humber|Humber| . According to  |Bede|Bede|  he was the fourth ruler to hold imperium over other southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: he was referred to in the  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , written centuries after his death, as a  bretwalda  . He was the first king of the East Angles to become a  |Christian|Christianity| , converting at Æthelberhts court some time before 605, whilst at the same time maintaining a pagan temple. In receiving the faith he helped to ensure the survival of Christianity in East Anglia during the  |apostasy|Apostasy|  of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of  |Essex|Kingdom_Of_Essex|  and  |Kent|Kingdom_Of_Kent| . He is generally considered by historians to be the most favoured candidate for the occupant of the  |Sutton_Hoo|Sutton_Hoo|  ship-burial, although other theories have been advanced.       The kingdom of East Anglia  was a small independent  |Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxons|  kingdom that comprised what are now the  |English|England|  counties of  |Norfolk|Norfolk|  and  |Suffolk|Suffolk|  and perhaps the eastern part of the Cambridgeshire  |Fens|Fens| .  Few sources have survived that were written by the  |Anglo-Saxons_in_England|Anglo-Saxon_England| , and East Anglia has even less documentary evidence than most of the kingdoms existing at that time. The historian  |Barbara_Yorke|Barbara_Yorke|  has suggested that the reason for the paucity of East Anglian sources was almost certainly the  |Viking_expansion|Viking_Expansion|  in the 9th century as the  |monks|Monks|  and  |scribes|Scribes|  of East Anglia produced as much work as those living in other parts of England. The devastation caused by the Vikings is thought to have destroyed all the books and  |charters|Charters|  that may have been kept there. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 58     Rædwald is the first king of the East Angles of whom more than a name is known, though no details of his life before his accession are known. Hoggett, The Archaeology of the East Anglian Conversion, pp. 28–30 The earliest and most substantial source for Rædwald is the  Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum  , completed in 731 by  |Bede|Bede| , a Northumbrian monk. Bede placed Rædwalds reign between the advent of the  |Gregorian_mission|Gregorian_Mission|  to  |Kent|Kingdom_Of_Kent|  in 597 and the marriage and conversion of  |Edwin_of_Northumbria|Edwin_Of_Northumbria|  during 625–26.      Later medieval  |chronicle|Chronicle| rs, such as  |Roger_of_Wendover|Roger_Of_Wendover| , gave some information about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the  |annal|Annal| istic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The  Anglian collection , which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 70  Regnal lists , by David E. Thornton, in  Rædwald is however referred to in the 8th century Vita of  |St_Gregory_the_Great|Pope_Gregory_I| , written by a member of the religious community at  |Whitby|Whitby_Abbey| . The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum, written by  |Henry_of_Huntingdon|Henry_Of_Huntingdon| . The chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon, comprising the history of England, from the invasion of Julius Cæsar to the accession of Henry II. Also, The acts of Stephen, king of England and duke of Normandy, translated by Thomas Forrester, is available to read           The Anglo-Saxons, who are known to have included  |Angles|Angles| ,  |Saxons|Saxons| ,  |Jutes|Jutes|  and  |Frisians|Frisii| , began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the conquered territories. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 1 By the beginning of the 7th century, southern  |England|England|  was almost entirely under their control. Hunter Blair, Roman Britain and Early England: 55 B.C.   A.D. 871, p. 204. Peter Hunter Blair gives the twenty-five years from 550 to 575 as the dates of the final conquest.     During Rædwalds youth, the establishment of other ruling houses was accomplished. Sometime before 588,  |Æthelberht_of_Kent|Æthelberht_Of_Kent|  married  |Bercta|Bertha_Of_Kent| , the Christian daughter of the  |Frankish|Franks|  ruler  |Charibert|Charibert| . As early as 568,  |Ceawlin_of_Wessex|Ceawlin_Of_Wessex| , the most powerful ruler south of the  |River_Humber|River_Humber| , repulsed Æthelberht. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 105 According to later sources,  |Mercia|Mercia|  was founded by  |Creoda|Creoda_Of_Mercia|  in 585, although a paucity of sources makes it difficult to know how the Mercian royal line became established. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 102     North of the Humber, the kingdoms of  |Deira|Kingdom_Of_Deira|  and  |Bernicia|Kingdom_Of_Bernicia|  possessed rival royal dynasties.  |Ælla|Ælla_Of_Deira|  ruled Deira until his death in 588, leaving his daughter Acha, his son  |Edwin|Edwin_Of_Northumbria| , and another unknown sibling. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 74–77 Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People, iii, pp. 152–153 The Bernician dynasty, allied by kinship to the kingdom of  |Wessex|Wessex| , gained ascendancy over Deira, forcing Edwin to live in exile in the court of  |Cadfan_ap_Iago|Cadfan_Ap_Iago|  of  |Gwynedd|Kingdom_Of_Gwynedd| . In various wars,  |Æthelfrith_of_Bernicia|Æthelfrith_Of_Northumbria|  consolidated the  |Northumbrian|Kingdom_Of_Northumbria|  state, and in around 604 he was able to bring Deira under his dominion.       Rædwald, which in Old English means power in counsel, Bosworth, A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language,  was born around 560–580. The son of Tytila, whom he succeeded, he was the elder brother of  |Eni|Eni_Of_East_Anglia| . According to  |Bede|Bede| , he was descended from  |Wuffa|Wuffa_Of_East_Anglia| , the founder of the Wuffingas dynasty: filius Tytili, cuius pater fuit UUffa . Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, p. 52 Newton, The Origins of Beowulf and the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia, p. 78     At some time during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman whose name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, ii, p. 15 By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and  |Eorpwald|Eorpwald_Of_East_Anglia| . He also had an older son,  |Sigeberht|Sigebert_Of_East_Anglia| , whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which is typical of the  |East_Saxon_dynasty|Kingdom_Of_Essex| . It has been suggested that Rædwalds queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwalds stepson, as was stated by  |William_of_Malmesbury|William_Of_Malmesbury|  in the 12th century. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 99–100 Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in  |Gaul|Gaul| , possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 72                                           :For a family tree that includes the descendants of Eni, see Wuffingas .            Events that occurred during the early years of Rædwalds reign include the arrival of  |Augustine_of_Canterbury|Augustine_Of_Canterbury|  and his  |mission|Mission|  from Rome in 597, the conversions of Æthelberht of Kent and Saeberht of Essex, and the establishment of new bishoprics in their kingdoms. Lapidge, The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 52, 174 Bede, when relating the conversion of Rædwalds son  |Eorpwald|Eorpwald_Of_East_Anglia|  in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, mentioned that Rædwald received the Christian  |sacraments|Sacraments|  in Kent. This happened in perhaps 604 or later, Lapidge, The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 385 presumably at the invitation of Æthelberht, who may have been his baptismal sponsor. The date of his conversion is unknown, but it would have occurred after the arrival of the  |Gregorian_mission|Gregorian_Mission|  in 597. Since it is claimed that Augustine, who died in about 605, dedicated a church near  |Ely|Ely,_Cambridgeshire| , it may have followed Saeberts conversion fairly swiftly. Rædwalds marriage to a member of the royal dynasty of Essex helped form a diplomatic alliance between the neighbouring kingdoms of East Anglia and Essex. His conversion in Kent would have affiliated him with Æthelberht, bringing him directly into the sphere of Kent. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 79     In East Anglia, Rædwalds conversion was not universally accepted by his household or his own queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from his commitment to the Christian faith. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 74–75 As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one dedicated to pagan Gods and the other to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how  |Ealdwulf_of_East_Anglia|Ealdwulf_Of_East_Anglia| , a grandson of Rædwalds brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at  |Rendlesham|Rendlesham| , emerging focus of the regio of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 75–76 Barbara Yorke argues that Rædwald was not willing to fully embrace Christianity because conversion via Æthelberht would have been acknowledgment of an inferior status to the Kentish king. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 160 Rædwalds lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.           Æthelfrith of Northumbria may have married Acha, Ziegler, Politics of Exile ,  . who was the mother of his son Oswald , according to Bede. Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, iii, p. 6 Æthelfrith pursued Achas exiled brother  |Edwin|Edwin_Of_Northumbria|  in an attempt to destroy him and ensure that the Bernician rulership of Northumbria would be unchallenged. Edwin found hospitality in the household of  |Cearl_of_Mercia|Cearl_Of_Mercia|  and later married Cearls daughter. Edwins nephew Hereric, an exile in the British kingdom of  |Elmet|Elmet| , was slain there under treacherous circumstances. Koch, Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia, vol. 1-5,  Edwin eventually sought the protection of Rædwald, where he was received willingly. Rædwald promised to protect him, and Edwin lived with the king amongst his royal companions. When news of Edwin reached Æthelfrith in Northumbria, he sent messengers to Rædwald offering money in return for Edwins death, but Rædwald refused to comply. Æthelfrith sent messengers a second and a third time, offering even greater gifts of silver and promising war if these were not accepted. Rædwald then weakened and promised either to kill Edwin or to hand him over to ambassadors.     When a chance arose for him to escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwalds court. He was then visited by a stranger who was aware of Rædwalds deliberations. The source for this story, written at  |Whitby|Whitby| , stated that the stranger was  |Paulinus_of_York|Paulinus_Of_York| , a member of the Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwalds support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 80 Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishops presence at Rædwalds court would throw some light on the kings position regarding religion. Hunt,  |Redwald|:S:Redwald|  ,  Dictionary of National Biography , p. 386     Rædwalds pagan queen admonished him for acting in a manner dishonourable for a king by betraying his trust for the sake of money and wanting to sell his imperiled friend in exchange for riches. As a result of her admonishment, once Æthelfriths ambassadors had gone, Rædwald resolved on war. Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, ii, 12       In 616 or 617, Rædwald assembled an army and marched north, accompanied by his son Rægenhere, to confront Æthelfrith. They met on the western boundary of the  |kingdom_of_Lindsey|Kingdom_Of_Lindsey| , on the east bank of the  |River_Idle|River_Idle| . The battle was fierce and was long commemorated in the saying, ‘The river Idle was foul with the blood of Englishmen’. During the fighting, Æthelfrith and Rædwalds son Rægenhere were both slain. Edwin then succeeded Æthelfrith as the king of Northumbria, and Æthelfriths sons were subsequently forced into exile. Newton, The Origins of Beowulf and the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia. p. 104     A separate account of the battle, given by  |Henry_of_Huntingdon|Henry_Of_Huntingdon| , stated that Rædwalds army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfriths men cut their way through to him and slew him. After the death of his son, Rædwald furiously breached his lines, killing Æthelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians. Forrester, The chronicle of Henry of Huntingdon, p. 56     D.P. Kirby has argued that the battle was more than a clash between two kings over the treatment of an exiled nobleman but was part of a protracted struggle to determine the military and political leadership of the Anglian peoples at that time.     imperium   On 24 February 616, Lapidge, The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 13 the year of the Battle of the River Idle, Æthelberht of Kent died and was succeeded by his pagan son  |Eadbald|Eadbald_Of_Kent| . After the death of the Christian  |Saebert_of_Essex|Saebert_Of_Essex| , his three sons shared the kingdom, returning it to pagan rule, and drove out the Gregorian missionaries led by  |Mellitus|Mellitus| . Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 48 The Canterbury mission had removed to Gaul before Eadbald was brought back into the fold. During this period the only royal Christian altar in England belonged to Rædwald. By the time of his death, the mission in Kent had been fully re-established. Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, p. 30     Rædwalds power became great enough for Bede to recognise him as the successor to the imperium of Æthelberht. Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, pp. 17–18 Bede also called him Rex Anglorum, the King of the Angles, a term that Rædwalds contemporaries would have used for their overlord. It is unclear where his power was centred or even how he established his authority over the Angles of eastern England. Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, pp. 53–55     By Edwins debt of allegiance to him, Rædwald became the first foreign king to hold direct influence in Northumbria. He would have been instrumental in Edwins secure establishment as king of both Deira and Bernicia. Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, pp. 61–62       During the first quarter of the 7th century, the quayside settlement at Gipeswic  became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the  |North_Sea|North_Sea| . Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 76–78     The excavated grave-goods of the Anglo-Saxon  |cemetery|Cemetery|  at Gipeswic, including those found in burials under small barrows, were not particularly wealthy or elaborate. They lacked the strong characterization of a neighbouring late 6th century cemetery at a higher crossing of the river. One exception was a furnished grave that has been suggested to be that of a visitor from the  |Rhineland|Rhineland| . Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 130       Rædwald is believed to have died around 624: his death can be located only within a few years. He must have reigned for some time after Æthelberht died, in order for him to have been noted as a bretwalda. Barbara Yorke suggests that he died before Edwin converted to Christianity in 627 and also before  |Paulinus|Paulinus_Of_York|  became bishop of Northumbria in 625. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 60 His death is recorded twice by  |Roger_of_Wendover|Roger_Of_Wendover| , in 599 and in 624, in a history that dates from the 13th century but appears to include earlier annals of unknown origin and reliability. Plunkett notes that the earlier date of 599 is now taken as a mistaken reference to the death of Rædwald’s father, Tytila, and the later date is commonly given for the death of Rædwald.     He was succeeded by his pagan son  |Eorpwald|Eorpwald_Of_East_Anglia| , who was later persuaded to adopt Christianity by Edwin of Northumbria.                Rædwald lived at a time when eminent individuals were buried in  |barrows|Tumulus|  at the cemetery at Sutton Hoo, near  |Woodbridge,_Suffolk|Woodbridge,_Suffolk| . There, large mounds—which were originally much higher and more visible—can still be seen, overlooking the upper estuary of the  |River_Deben|River_Deben| . Newton, The Origins of Beowulf and the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia, p. 44     In 1939, a mound at Sutton Hoo, now known as Mound 1, was discovered to contain an Anglo-Saxon ship-burial of unparalleled richness. The mound enclosed a ship,  long, which had seen use on the seas and had been repaired. In the centre of the ship was a chamber containing a collection of jewellery and other rich grave goods, including silver bowls, drinking vessels, clothing and weaponry. One unusual item was a large  |sceptre|Sceptre|  in the form of a  |whetstone|Sharpening_Stone|  that showed no sign of previous use as a tool: it has been suggested that this was a symbol of the office of bretwalda. The gold and garnet body-equipment found with the other goods was produced for a patron who employed a  |goldsmith|Goldsmith|  the equal or better than any in Europe and was designed to project an image of imperial power. The Mediterranean silverware in the grave is a unique assemblage for its period in Europe. Lapidge , Sutton Hoo , M.O.H. Carver, in The Blackwall Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 432 Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 82–96: Plunkett provides a very detailed description of the layout and contents of the mound.     The magnificence of the objects, both the personal possessions and those items designed to denote the authority of the dead individual, point to the death of a person connected with the royal court, according to  |Rupert_Bruce-Mitford|Rupert_Bruce-Mitford| , Bruce-Mitford, Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology: Sutton Hoo and other discoveries, pp. 3–5 who regards the burial as very likely the monument of the High King or bretwalda Raedwald . Bruce-Mitford, Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology: Sutton Hoo and other discoveries, p. 73 Yorke suggests that the treasures buried with the ship reflect the size of the tribute paid to Rædwald by subject kings during his period as bretwalda. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 59–60, 158 Bruce-Mitford has suggested that the inclusion of bowls and spoons amongst the treasures fits with Bedes account of Raedwalds conversion: the spoons may have been a present for a convert from paganism and the bowls had Christian significance. Bruce-Mitford, Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology: Sutton Hoo and other discoveries, pp. 26, 33 Coins found in the burial have been dated to the approximate date of Rædwalds death.  The controversy surrounding the identity of the person for whom the mound was built are reflected in the comments in the article on Rædwald in the  Oxford Dictionary of National Biography  Campbell, Rædwald and by McClure and Collins, who note that the evidence for Raedwald is almost non-existent . Bede, edited by McClure and Collins, The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, n. 98, p. 381     Alternative suggestions as candidates include other East Anglian kings or a prestigious foreign visitor. Bruce-Mitford, Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology: Sutton Hoo and other discoveries, p. 3 There are alternative explanations: the person may have been a wealthy status-seeker, rather than a king, Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, p. 66 though  |Rendlesham|Rendlesham| , a known residence of the East Anglian kings, is only  away. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 51      |Swedish|Sweden|  cultural influence has been detected at Sutton Hoo: there are strong similarities in both the armour and the burial with  |Vendel-age|Vendel-Age|  finds from Sweden. Bruce-Mitford suggested that the connection is close enough to imply that the  |Wuffing|Wuffing|  dynasty came from that part of Scandinavia. Bruce-Mitford, Aspects of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology: Sutton Hoo and other discoveries, p. 57 There are also significant differences, and exact parallels with the workmanship and style of the Sutton Hoo artefacts cannot be found elsewhere; as a result the connection is generally regarded as unproven. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 34 Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, p. 61     It is also possible that the mound is actually a  |cenotaph|Cenotaph| .
