                 Micronesia  is a  |subregion|Subregion|  of  |Oceania|Oceania| , composed of thousands of small islands in the western  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| . It has a close shared cultural history with two other island regions:  |Polynesia|Polynesia|  to the east and  |Island_Melanesia|Melanesia|  to the south; as well as the wider  |Austronesian_peoples|Austronesian_Peoples| .     The region has a  |tropical_marine_climate|Tropical_Marine_Climate|  and is part of the  |Oceania_ecozone|Oceania_Ecozone| . There are five main  |archipelagos|Archipelago| —the  |Caroline_Islands|Caroline_Islands| , the  |Gilbert_Islands|Gilbert_Islands| , the  |Line_Islands|Line_Islands| , the  |Mariana_Islands|Mariana_Islands| , and the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands| —along with numerous outlying islands.     Politically, the islands of Micronesia are divided between six sovereign nations: the Caroline Islands are divided between the  |Republic_of_Palau|Palau|  and the  |Federated_States_of_Micronesia|Federated_States_Of_Micronesia| , the latter often shortened to FSM or Micronesia and not to be confused with the overall region; the Gilbert Islands and the Line Islands comprise the Republic of  |Kiribati|Kiribati| , except for three of the Line Islands that are United States territories ; the Mariana Islands are in union with the United States, divided between the  |U_S_Territory_of|Territories_Of_The_United_States| |_Guam|Guam|  and the  |U_S_Commonwealth_of_the|Commonwealth| |_Northern_Mariana_Islands|Northern_Mariana_Islands| ;  |Nauru|Nauru|  is a fully sovereign nation, coextensive with the island of the same name; and the Republic of the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|  is coextensive with that island group. Also noteworthy is  |Wake_Island|Wake_Island| , which is claimed by both the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the United States, the latter having actual possession under immediate administration of the  |United_States_Air_Force|United_States_Air_Force| .      |Human_settlement_of_Micronesia|Austronesian_Peoplesmigration_And_Dispersion|  began several millennia ago. There are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first Micronesians. The earliest known contact with Europeans occurred in 1521, when Spanish ships landed in the  |Marianas|Marianas| . The term Micronesia is usually attributed to  |Jules_Dumont_dUrvilles|Jules_Dumont_Durville|  use of it in 1832, but Domeny de Rienzi had used the term a year previously.          Micronesia is a region that includes approximately 2100 islands, with a total land area of , the largest of which is  |Guam|Guam| , which covers . The total ocean area within the perimeter of the islands is .     There are five main island groups in Micronesia:   the  |Caroline_Islands|Caroline_Islands|     the  |Gilbert_Islands|Gilbert_Islands|  and the  |Line_Islands|Line_Islands|     the  |Line_Islands|Line_Islands|     the  |Mariana_Islands|Mariana_Islands|     the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|      Plus the separate island nation of  |Nauru|Nauru| , among other distinctly separate islands and smaller island groups.       The  |Caroline_Islands|Caroline_Islands|  are a widely scattered  |archipelago|Archipelago|  consisting of about 500 small  |coral_islands|Coral_Island| , north of  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea|  and east of the  |Philippines|Philippines| . The Carolines consist of two republics: the  |Federated_States_of_Micronesia|Federated_States_Of_Micronesia| , consisting of approximately 600 islands on the eastern side of the chain with Kosrae being the most eastern; and  |Palau|Palau|  consisting of 250 islands on the western side.       The  |Gilbert_Islands|Gilbert_Islands|  are a chain of sixteen  |atolls|Atoll|  and coral islands, arranged in an approximate north-to-south line. In a geographical sense, the  |equator|Equator|  serves as the dividing line between the northern Gilbert Islands and the southern Gilbert Islands. The  |Republic_of_Kiribati|Kiribati|  contains all of the Gilberts, as well as the island of  |Tarawa|Tarawa| , the site of the countrys capital.          The  |Mariana_Islands|Mariana_Islands|  are an arc-shaped  |archipelago|Archipelago|  made up by the summits of fifteen volcanic mountains. The island chain arises as a result of the western edge of the  |Pacific_Plate|Pacific_Plate|  moving westward and plunging downward below the  |Mariana_plate|Mariana_Plate| , a region which is the most volcanically active convergent plate boundary on Earth. The Marianas were politically divided in 1898, when the United States acquired title to  |Guam|Guam|  under the  |Treaty_of_Paris_1898|Treaty_Of_Paris| , which ended the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War| . Spain then sold the remaining northerly islands to  |Germany|German_Empire|  in 1899. Germany lost all of her colonies at the end of  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and the  |Northern_Mariana_Islands|Northern_Mariana_Islands|  became a  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  Mandate, with  |Japan|Japan|  as the mandatory. After  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , the islands were transferred into the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| |_Trust_Territory|United_Nations_Trust_Territories|  System, with the  |United_States|United_States|  as Trustee. In 1976, the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States entered into a covenant of political union under which commonwealth status was granted the Northern Mariana Islands and its residents received United States citizenship.          The  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|  are located north of  |Nauru|Nauru|  and  |Kiribati|Kiribati| , east of the  |Federated_States_of_Micronesia|Federated_States_Of_Micronesia|  and south of the U.S. territory of  |Wake_Island|Wake_Island| . The islands consist of 29 low-lying  |atolls|Atoll|  and 5 isolated islands,  comprising 1,156 individual islands and  |islets|Islet| . The atolls and islands form two groups: the  |Ratak_Chain|Ratak_Chain|  and the  |Ralik_Chain|Ralik_Chain|  . All the islands in the chain are part of the  |Republic_of_the_Marshall_Islands|Republic_Of_The_Marshall_Islands| , a  |presidential|Presidential_System| |_republic|Republic|  in  |free_association|Associated_State|  with the United States. Having few natural resources, the islands wealth is based on a  |service_economy|Service_Economy| , as well as some  |fishing|Fishing|  and  |agriculture|Agriculture| . Of the 29 atolls, 24 of them are inhabited.      |Bikini_Atoll|Bikini_Atoll|  is an atoll in the Marshall Islands. There are 23 islands in the Bikini Atoll. The islands of Bokonijien, Aerokojlol and Nam were vaporized during nuclear tests that occurred there.  The islands are composed of low coral limestone and sand.  The average elevation is only about   |Castle_Bravo|Castle_Bravo|  nuclear test, detonated on March 1, 1954, at  |Bikini_Atoll|Bikini_Atoll|   of the US Navy on  |Bikini_Atoll|Bikini_Atoll| , one of several Marshall Islands used for  |atomic_bomb_tests|Bikini_Atomic_Experiments| |_Kili_Island|Kili_Island|  is one of the smallest islands in the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands| .          |Nauru|Nauru|  is an oval-shaped  |island_country|Island_Country|  in the southwestern Pacific Ocean,  south of the  |Equator|Equator| , listed as the  |worlds_smallest_republic|List_Of_Countries_By_Area| , covering just .  With  residents, it is the third  |least_populated_country|List_Of_Countries_By_Population| , after  |Vatican_City|Vatican_City|  and  |Tuvalu|Tuvalu| . The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles. The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a  |seaport|Seaport| , although  |channels|Canals_In_Nauru|  in the reef allow small boats access to the island.  A fertile coastal strip  wide lies inland from the beach.   |Denigomodu|Denigomodu|  and  |Nibok|Nibok| |_Wake_Island|Wake_Island|  is a coral atoll with a coastline of  just north of the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands| . It is an  |unorganized|Unorganized_Territory| ,  |unincorporated_territory|Unincorporated_Territory|  of the United States. Access to the island is restricted and all activities on the island are managed by the  |United_States_Air_Force|United_States_Air_Force| |_United_States_Exploring_Expedition|United_States_Exploring_Expedition| , drawn by  |Alfred_Thomas_Agate|Alfred_Thomas_Agate|     The majority of the islands in the area are part of a  |coral_atoll|Atoll| . Coral atolls begin as  |coral_reefs|Coral_Reefs|  that grow on the slopes of a central  |volcano|Volcano| . When the volcano sinks back down into the sea, the coral continues to grow, keeping the reef at or above water level. One exception is  |Pohnpei|Pohnpei_State|  in the  |Federated_States_of_Micronesia|Federated_States_Of_Micronesia| , which still has the central volcano and coral reefs around it.                    The region has a  |tropical_marine_climate|Tropical_Marine_Climate|  moderated by seasonal northeast  |trade_winds|Trade_Winds| . There is little seasonal temperature variation. The dry season runs from December or January to June and the rainy season from July to November or December. Because of the location of some islands, the rainy season can sometimes include  |typhoons|Typhoon| .                    The  |Northern_Marianas|Northern_Marianas|  were the first islands in  |Oceania|Oceania|  colonized by the  |Austronesian_peoples|Austronesian_Peoples| . It was settled by the voyagers who sailed eastwards from the  |Philippines|Philippines|  at approximately 1500 BCE. These populations gradually moved southwards until they reached the  |Bismarck_Archipelago|Bismarck_Archipelago|  and the  |Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands|  by 1300 BCE and reconnected with the  |Lapita_culture|Lapita_Culture|  of the southeast migration branch of Austronesians moving through coastal  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea|  and  |Island_Melanesia|Island_Melanesia| . By 1200 BCE, they again began crossing open seas beyond inter-island visibility, reaching  |Vanuatu|Vanuatu| ,  |Fiji|Fiji| , and  |New_Caledonia|New_Caledonia| ; before continuing eastwards to become the ancestors of the  |Polynesian_people|Polynesian_People| .       Further migrations by other Austronesians also followed, likely from  |Sulawesi|Sulawesi| , settling  |Palau|Palau|  and  |Yap|Yap|  by around 1000 BCE. The details of this colonization, however, is not very well known.  In 200 BCE, a loosely connected group of Lapita colonists from  |Island_Melanesia|Island_Melanesia|  also migrated back northwards, settling the islands of eastern Micronesia almost simultaneously. This region became the center of another wave of migrations radiating outwards, reconnecting them with other settled islands in western Micronesia.     At around 800 CE, a second wave of migrants from Southeast Asia arrived in the Marianas, beginning what is now known as the  |Latte_period|Latte_Period| . These new settlers built large structures with distinctive capped stone pillars known as haligi. They also reintroduced  |rice|Rice|  , making the Northern Marianas the only islands in  |Oceania|Oceania|  where rice was grown prior to European contact. However, they were considered high-status crops and only used in rituals. They did not become a staple until after  |Spanish_colonization|Spanish_East_Indies| .       Construction of  |Nan_Madol|Nan_Madol| , a  |megalith|Megalith| ic complex made from  |basalt_lava_logs|Basaltcolumnar_Basalt|  in Pohnpei began at around 1180 CE. This was followed by the construction of the  |Leluh_complex|Leluh_Archaeological_Site|  in  |Kosrae|Kosrae|  at around 1200 CE.    |Nan_Madol|Nan_Madol| |_Leluh|Leluh_Archaeological_Site| |_Latte_stone|Latte_Stone| |_Rai_stone|Rai_Stone|             The earliest known contact with Europeans occurred in 1521, when a Spanish expedition under  |Ferdinand_Magellan|Ferdinand_Magellan|  reached the Marianas  This contact is recorded in  |Antonio_Pigafettas|Antonio_Pigafetta|  chronicle of Magellans voyage, in which he recounts that the Chamorro people had no apparent knowledge of people outside of their island group. Levesque, R. . History of Micronesia: A collection of source documents, . Quebec, Canada: Levesque Publications pp. 249, 251 A Portuguese account of the same voyage suggests that the Chamorro people who greeted the travellers did so without any shyness as if they were good acquaintances , raising the possibility that earlier unrecorded contact had occurred.     Further contact was made during the sixteenth century, although often initial encounters were very brief. Documents relating to the 1525 voyage of  |Diogo_da_Rocha|Diogo_Da_Rocha|  suggest that he made the first European contact with inhabitants of the Caroline Islands, possibly staying on the  |Ulithi|Ulithi|  atoll for four months and encountering  |Yap|Yap| . Marshall Islanders were encountered by  |Alvaro_de_Saavedra|Alvaro_De_Saavedra|  in 1529.  More certain recorded contact with the Yap islands occurred in 1625.       In the early 17th century  |Spain|Spain|  colonized  |Guam|Guam| , the  |Northern_Marianas|Northern_Marianas|  and the  |Caroline_Islands|Caroline_Islands|  , creating the  |Spanish_East_Indies|Spanish_East_Indies| , which was governed from the  |Spanish_Philippines|Spanish_Philippines| .     In 1819, the  |American_Board_of_Commissioners_for_Foreign_Missions|American_Board_Of_Commissioners_For_Foreign_Missions|  – a Protestant group – brought their Puritan ways to Polynesia. Soon after, the Hawaiian Missionary Society was founded and sent missionaries into Micronesia. Conversion was not met with as much opposition, as the local religions were less developed . In contrast, it took until the end of the 19th/beginning of the 20th centuries for missionaries to fully convert the inhabitants of Melanesia; however, before a cultural contrast can even be made, one cannot neglect to take into account the fact that Melanesia has always had deadly strains of more  |malaria|Malaria|  present in various degrees and distributions throughout its history  and up to the present; in contrast, Micronesia does not and never seems to have had any malarial mosquitos nor pathogens on any of its islands in the past.              In the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War| , Spain lost many of its remaining colonies. In the Pacific, the United States took possession of the  |Spanish_Philippines|Spanish_Philippines|  and Guam. On January 17, 1899, the United States also took possession of unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island. This left Spain with the remainder of the Spanish East Indies, about 6,000 tiny islands that were sparsely populated and not very productive. These islands were ungovernable after the loss of the administrative center of Manila and indefensible after the loss of two Spanish fleets in the war. The Spanish government therefore decided to sell the remaining islands to a new colonial power: the  |German_Empire|German_Empire| .     The treaty, which was signed by Spanish Prime Minister  |Francisco_Silvela|Francisco_Silvela|  on February 12, 1899, transferred the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, Palau and other possessions to Germany. Under German control, the islands became a protectorate and were administered from  |German_New_Guinea|German_New_Guinea| . Nauru had already been annexed and claimed as a colony by Germany in 1888.          In the early 20th century, the islands of Micronesia were divided between three foreign powers:   the  |United_States|United_States| , which took control of Guam following the Spanish–American War of 1898 and claimed  |Wake_Island|Wake_Island| ;    |Germany|German_Empire| , which took Nauru and bought the Marshall, Caroline and Northern Mariana Islands from Spain; and   the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| , which took the  |Gilbert_Islands|Gilbert_Islands|  .     During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , Germanys Pacific island territories were seized and became  |League_of_Nations_mandates|League_Of_Nations_Mandate|  in 1923. Nauru became an  |Australia|Australia| n mandate, while Germanys other territories in Micronesia were given as a mandate to  |Japan|Japan|  and were named the  |South_Pacific_Mandate|South_Pacific_Mandate| . During  |World_War_II|World_War_Nbsp_Ii| , Nauru was occupied by  |Japanese|Empire_Of_Japan|  troops and was bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. Following Japans defeat in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  its mandate became a  |United_Nations_Trusteeship|United_Nations_Trusteeship|  administered by the United States as the  |Trust_Territory_of_the_Pacific_Islands|Trust_Territory_Of_The_Pacific_Islands| . Nauru became independent in 1968.       Today, most of Micronesia are independent states, except for the  |U_S_Commonwealth_of_the|Commonwealth| |_Northern_Mariana_Islands|Northern_Mariana_Islands| , Guam and Wake Island, which are U.S. territories.       The  |Pacific_Community|Pacific_Community|  is a regional intergovernmental organisation whose membership includes both nations and territories in the Pacific Ocean and their metropolitan powers.              Nationally, the primary income is the sale of fishing rights to foreign nations that harvest tuna using huge  |purse_seine|Purse_Seine| rs. A few Japanese  |long_liners|Longline_Fishing|  still ply the waters. The crews aboard fishing fleets contribute little to the local economy since their ships typically set sail loaded with stores and provisions that are cheaper than local goods. Additional money comes in from government grants, mostly from the United States and the $150 million the US paid into a trust fund for reparations of residents of Bikini Atoll that had to move after nuclear testing. Few mineral deposits worth exploiting exist, except for some high-grade phosphate,  |especially_on_Nauru|Phosphate_Mining_In_Nauru| .     Most residents of Micronesia can freely move to and work within, the United States. Relatives working in the US that send money home to relatives represent the primary source of individual income. Additional individual income comes mainly from government jobs and work within shops and restaurants.     The  |tourist_industry|Tourist_Industry|  consists mainly of scuba divers that come to see the coral reefs, do wall dives and visit sunken ships from WWII. Major stops for scuba divers in approximate order are Palau, Chuuk, Yap and Pohnpei. Some private yacht owners visit the area for months or years at a time. However, they tend to stay mainly at ports of entry and are too few in number to be counted as a major source of income.     Copra production used to be a more significant source of income, however, world prices have dropped in part to large palm plantations that are now planted in places like  |Borneo|Borneo| .          The people today form many ethnicities, but all are descended from and belong to the Micronesian culture. The Micronesian culture was one of the last native cultures of the region to develop. It developed from a mixture of  |Melanesians|Melanesians|  and  |Filipinos|Filipino_People| .   Because of this mixture of descent, many of the ethnicities of Micronesia feel closer to some groups in  |Melanesia|Melanesia| , or the  |Philippines|Philippines| . A good example of this are the  |Yapese_people|Yapese_People|  who are related to  |Austronesian|Austronesian|  tribes in the northern  |Philippines|Philippines| .  A 2011 survey found that 93.1% of Micronesian are  |Christians|Christians| . , Center for the Study of Global Christianity Genetics also show a significant number of Micronesian have Japanese paternal ancestry. Its found in 9.5% of males from Micronesia as well as 0.2% in  |East_Timor|East_Timor|  carry the  |Haplogroup_D_M55|Haplogroup_D_M55| .      There are also substantial Asian communities found across the region, most notably in the  |Northern_Mariana_Islands|Northern_Mariana_Islands|  where they form the majority and smaller communities of Europeans who have migrated from the United States or are descendants of settlers during European colonial rule in Micronesia.     Though they are all geographically part of the same region, they all have very different colonial histories. The US-administered areas of Micronesia have a unique experience that sets them apart from the rest of the Pacific. Micronesia has great economic dependency on its former or current motherlands, something only comparable to the French Pacific. Sometimes, the term American Micronesia is used to acknowledge the difference in cultural heritage.            It is thought that ancestors of the  |Carolinian_people|Carolinian_People|  may have originally immigrated from the Asian mainland and  |Indonesia|Indonesia|  to Micronesia around 2,000 years ago. Their primary language is  |Carolinian|Carolinian_Language| , called Refaluwasch by native speakers, which has a total of about 5,700 speakers. The Carolinians have a  |matriarchal|Matriarchy|  society in which respect is a very important factor in their daily lives, especially toward the  |matriarchs|Matriarch| . Most Carolinians are of the  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  faith.     The immigration of Carolinians to  |Saipan|Saipan|  began in the early 19th century, after the  |Spanish|Spain|  reduced the local population of  |Chamorro|Chamorro_People|  natives to just 3,700. They began to  |immigrate|Immigrate|  mostly sailing from small  |canoes|Canoes|  from other islands, which a  |typhoon|Typhoon|  previously devastated. The Carolinians have a much darker complexion than the native  |Chamorros|Chamorro_People| .            The  |Chamorro_people|Chamorro_People|  are the  |indigenous_peoples|Indigenous_Peoples|  of the  |Mariana_Islands|Mariana_Islands| , which are politically divided between the  |United_States_territory|Territories_Of_The_United_States|  of  |Guam|Guam|  and the United States  |Commonwealth_of_the_Northern_Mariana_Islands|Commonwealth_Of_The_Northern_Mariana_Islands|  in Micronesia. The Chamorro are commonly believed to have come from  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia|  at around 2000  |BC|Common_Era| . They are most closely related to other  |Austronesian|Austronesian|  natives to the west in the  |Philippines|Philippines|  and  |Taiwan|Taiwanese_Aborigines| , as well as the  |Carolines|Caroline_Islands|  to the south.     The  |Chamorro_language|Chamorro_Language|  is included in the  |Malayo_Polynesian_subgroup|Malayo_Polynesian_Languages|  of the  |Austronesian|Austronesian_Languages|  family. Because Guam was colonized by Spain for over 300 years, many words derive from the  |Spanish_language|Spanish_Language| . The traditional Chamorro number system was replaced by Spanish numbers.

They constitute 48% of the population of the  |Federated_States_of_Micronesia|Federated_States_Of_Micronesia| . Their language is  |Chuukese|Chuukese_Language| . The home atoll of Chuuk is also known by the former name Truk.         The roughly 3000 residents of the Federated States of Micronesia that reside in  |Kapingamarangi|Kapingamarangi| , nicknamed Kapings, are both one of the most remote and most difficult people to visit in Micronesia and the entire world. Their home atoll is almost a  round trip to the nearest point of immigration check-in and check-out. There are no regular flights. The only way to legally visit is to first check-in, travel on a high-speed sailboat to the atoll and then backtrack almost . Owing to this difficulty, only a handful of the few sailors that travel across the Pacific will attempt to visit. The local language is the  |Kapingamarangi_language|Kapingamarangi_Language| . The children typically attend high school on Pohnpei where they stay with relatives in an enclave that is almost exclusively made up of Kapings.         The  |Nauruan_people|Nauruan_People|  are an  |ethnicity|Ethnicity|  inhabiting the  |Pacific|Pacific_Ocean| |_island|Island|  of  |Nauru|Nauru| . They are most likely a blend of  |other_Pacific_peoples|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_Oceania| .      The origin of the Nauruan people has not yet been finally determined. It can possibly be explained by the last Malayo-Pacific  |human_migration|Human_Migration|  . It was probably seafaring or shipwrecked  |Polynesians|Polynesians|  or  |Melanesians|Melanesian| , which established themselves there because there was not already an  |indigenous_people|Indigenous_People|  present, whereas the Micronesians were already crossed with the Melanesians in this area.            There are large  |Asian|Asian_People|  communities found across certain Micronesian countries that are either immigrants, foreign workers or descendants of either one, most migrated to the islands during the 1800s and 1900s.  According to the 2010 census results Guam was 26.3%  |Filipino|Overseas_Filipino| , 2.2%  |Korean|Korean_Diaspora| , 1.6%  |Chinese|Overseas_Chinese|  and 2% other Asian.  The 2010 census showed the Northern Mariana Islands was 50% Asian of which 35.3% were Filipino, 6.8% Chinese, 4.2% Korean and 3.7% other Asian .  The 2010 census for the Federated States of Micronesia showed 1.4% were Asian while statistics for Nauru showed 8% of Nauruans were Chinese.   The 2005 census results for Palau showed 16.3% were Filipino, 1.6% Chinese, 1.6% Vietnamese and 3.4% other Asian .      Japanese rule in Micronesia also led to Japanese people settling the islands and marrying native spouses.  |Kessai_Note|Kessai_Note| , the former president of the  |Marshall_Islands|Marshall_Islands|  has partial Japanese ancestry by way of his paternal grandfather, and  |Emanuel_Mori|Manny_Mori| , the former president of  |The_Federated_States_of_Micronesia|Federated_States_Of_Micronesia| , is descended from one of the first settlers from Japan,  |Koben_Mori|Mori_Koben| .

The 2010 census results of Guam showed 7.1% were white while the 2005 census for Palau showed 8% were European. Smaller numbers at 1.9% in Palau and 1.8% in the Northern Mariana Islands were recorded as white . In conjunction to the European communities there are large amounts of mixed Micronesians, some of which have European ancestry.       The largest group of languages spoken in Micronesia are the  |Micronesian_languages|Micronesian_Languages| . They are in the family of  |Oceanic_languages|Oceanic_Languages| , part of the  |Austronesian_language|Austronesian_Languages|  group. They are descended from the  |protolanguage|Protolanguage| |_Proto_Oceanic|Proto_Oceanic_Language| , which are developed from  |Proto_Austronesian|Proto_Austronesian_Language| .     The languages in the Micronesian family are  |Marshallese|Marshallese_Language| ,  |Gilbertese|Gilbertese_Language| ,  |Kosraean|Kosraean_Language| ,  |Nauruan|Nauruan_Language| , as well as a large sub-family called the  |Trukic–Ponapeic_languages|Trukic–Ponapeic_Languages|  containing 11 languages.
