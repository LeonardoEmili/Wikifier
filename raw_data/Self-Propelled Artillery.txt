                      Self-propelled artillery  is  |artillery|Artillery|  equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. Within the terminology are the  |self-propelled_gun|Self-Propelled_Gun| ,  |self-propelled_howitzer|Self-Propelled_Howitzer| ,  |self-propelled_mortar|Self-Propelled_Mortar| , and  |rocket_artillery|Rocket_Artillery| . They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on  |continuous_tracks|Continuous_Track|  carrying either a large  |field_gun|Field_Gun| ,  |howitzer|Howitzer| ,  |mortar|Mortar| , or some form of  |rocket|Rocket| /missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range  |indirect|Indirect-Fire| |bombardment|Bombardment|  support on the battlefield.     In the past, self-propelled artillery has included  |direct-fire|Direct-Fire|  vehicles, such as  |assault_guns|Assault_Gun|  and  |tank_destroyers|Tank_Destroyer| . These have been heavily armoured vehicles, the former providing close fire-support for infantry and the latter acting as specialized anti-tank vehicles.     Modern self-propelled artillery vehicles may superficially resemble  |tanks|Tank| , but they are generally lightly armoured, too lightly to survive in direct-fire combat. However, they protect their crews against  |shrapnel|Shrapnel|  and small arms and are therefore usually included as  |armoured_fighting_vehicles|Armoured_Fighting_Vehicle| . Many are equipped with  |machine_guns|Machine_Gun|  for defense against enemy infantry.     The key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought—usually towed—to the new location. By comparison, self-propelled artillery can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This  |shoot-and-scoot|Shoot-And-Scoot|  ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance. Bailey, Johnathan B. A., Field Artillery and Firepower, Naval Institute Press, 2004, p.6     Conversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach. Since the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| , heavy  |transport_helicopters|Transport_Helicopter|  have also been used for rapid artillery deployment. So, despite the advantages of the self-propelled artillery, towed guns remain in the  |arsenals|Arsenal|  of many modern armies.               During the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| , early 17th century experiments were made with early types of  |horse_artillery|Horse_Artillery| . Batteries towed light field guns where most or all of the crew rode horses into battle. The gunners were trained to quickly dismount, deploy the guns and provide instant fire support to cavalry, and act as a flexible reserve. The Russian army organized small units of horse artillery that were distributed among their cavalry formations in the early 18th century. While not forming large batteries and employing only lighter 2- and 3-pound guns, they were still effective and inflicted serious losses to Prussian units in the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War| . This inspired  |Frederick_the_Great|Frederick_The_Great|  to organize the first regular horse artillery unit in 1759. Other nations quickly realized the capability of the new arm and by the start of  |French_Revolutionary_Wars|French_Revolutionary_Wars|  in 1790s Austria, Hannover, Portugal, Russia, France, Great Britain and Sweden had all formed regular units of horse artillery. The arm was employed throughout the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars|  and remained in use throughout the entire 19th century and into the first half of the 20th century, when advances in weapons technology finally made it obsolete.            The British  |Gun_Carrier_Mark_I|Gun_Carrier_Mark_I|  was the first example of a self-propelled gun, fielded in 1917 during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . It was based on the first  |tank|Tank| , the British  |Mark_I|Mark_I|  and carried a heavy field gun. The gun could either be fired from the vehicle, or removed and set up as normal. In effect, the carrier replaced the use of a separate horse team or internal combustion engine powered  |artillery_tractor|Artillery_Tractor| , and allowed a new way for the gun to be used.       The next major advance can be seen in the  |Birch_gun|Birch_Gun|  developed by the British for their motorised warfare experimental brigade  after the end of the War. This mounted a field gun, capable of both the usual artillery trajectories and high angle  |anti-aircraft_fire|Anti-Aircraft_Warfare| , on a tank style chassis. It was designed and built as part of a general approach to warfare where all arms, infantry and artillery included, would be able to operate over the same terrain as tanks. The  |Red_Army|Red_Army|  also experimented with truck- and tank-mounted artillery, but produced none in quantity.             At the outbreak of World War II, virtually all artillery was still being moved around by artillery tractors or horses. While the German  |Blitzkrieg|Blitzkrieg|  doctrine called for combined-arms action, which required fire support for armoured units, during the invasion of Poland and France this was provided by the Luftwaffe using  |Stuka|Stuka| |dive-bombers|Dive-Bomber|  effectively acting as artillery. Conventional towed howitzers followed.     As the war progressed, most nations developed self-propelled artillery. Some early attempts were often no more than a field gun or anti-tank gun mounted on a truck—a technique known in the British Army as carrying  portee . These were mobile, but lacked protection for the crew. The next step was to mount the guns on a tracked chassis and provide an armoured superstructure to protect the gun and its crew. Many of the early designs were improvised and the lessons learned led to better designs later in the war. For example, the first British design,  |Bishop|Bishop|  , carried the  |25_pdr_gun-howitzer|Ordnance_Qf_25_Pounder| , but in a mounting that severely limited the guns performance. It was replaced by the more effective  |Sexton|Sexton| .     The Germans were particularly prolific with designs. They created many examples of lightly armored self-propelled anti-tank guns using captured French equipment , their own obsolete light tank chassis , or ex-Czech chassis . These led to better-protected  |Assault_guns|Assault_Gun|  or  |Sturmgeschütz|Sturmgeschütz|  with fully enclosed  |casemates|Casematearmoured_Vehicles| , built on medium tank chassis such as the  |Jagdpanzer_IV|Jagdpanzer_Iv|  and  |Jagdpanther|Jagdpanther| . Some designs were based on existing chassis , leftover chassis from cancelled programs ; others were converted from battle-damaged tanks . The single most-produced armored fighting vehicle design for Germany in WW II, the  |Sturmgeschütz_III|Sturmgeschütz_Iii|  assault gun, in 1936–37 pioneered the later casemate-style fully enclosed armor that would be used on almost all late-war German self-propelled artillery and  Jagdpanzer -format tank destroyers.     The Soviets experimented with truck-and tank-based self-propelled weapons, producing a few Komsomoletz tractor-mounted 57-mm  |ZiS-2|Zis-2|  guns early in the war. By 1943, the series of  Samokhodnaya Ustanovka  casemate-armored vehicles had started to appear at the front, starting with the  |SU-85|Su-85| , and by late 1944 the  |SU-100|Su-100| , which mounted powerful guns on modern chassis adopting the full-casemate enclosure of the crew compartment as the Germans had done with the StuG III. These had the advantage of being relatively cheap to build and mounting a larger gun compared to the conventional tank that they were derived from, but at the expense of flexibility.     Heavily armoured  |assault_guns|Assault_Gun|  were designed to provide direct-fire support to infantry in the face of enemy defenses. Although often similar to tank destroyers, they carried larger caliber guns with weaker anti-armor performance but capable of firing powerful  |HE|Shell_High-Explosive|  projectiles. The German 105mm howitzer-armed  |StuH_42|Sturmgeschütz_Iiifurther_Variants|  based on the StuG III, and the immense 152mm howitzer-armed, Soviet  |ISU-152|Isu-152| , both fully casemated in their design, are examples of this type of self-propelled artillery.     All major nations developed self-propelled artillery that would be able to provide indirect support while keeping pace with advancing armoured formations. These were usually lightly armoured vehicles with an open-topped hull; the US  |M7_Priest|M7_Priest| , British  |Sexton|Sexton|  and German  |Wespe|Wespe|  and  |Hummel|Hummel|  being typical examples. A different route was chosen by the Soviets, who did not develop a specialized indirect fire vehicle, but following a tradition of dual-purpose towed artillery, built a series of versatile assault guns with indirect fire capabilities . A related and novel program was the development of the Soviet  |Katyusha|Katyusha_Rocket_Launcher|  self-propelled  |multiple_rocket_launchers|Multiple_Rocket_Launcher| , which were unarmored trucks with a simple rocket rack on the back, a cheap and crushingly effective weapon, provided area saturation was called for rather than accurate fire.     After the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , the assault gun fell from use with a general trend towards a single heavy gun-equipped vehicle, the  |main_battle_tank|Main_Battle_Tank| , although some wheeled AFVs such as the South African  |Rooikat|Rooikat| , the  |Maneuver_Combat_Vehicle|Maneuver_Combat_Vehicle|  of the  |JGSDF|Japan_Ground_Self-Defense_Force| , and the US  |M1128_MGS|M1128_Mobile_Gun_System| , among others, are still developed with large-caliber, direct fire weapons. Self-propelled indirect-fire artillery remains important and continues to develop alongside the general purpose field gun.             Many vehicles have used ancillary  |smoke_mortars|Smoke_Grenade|  for local defense, which project one or more smoke grenades in a pattern that allows them to lay down a smoke screen some distance in order to conceal the vehicle from enemy observers.  |Mortar_carriers|Mortar_Carrier|  are vehicles which carry a  |mortar|Mortar|  as a primary weapon. Numerous vehicles have been used to mount mortars, from  |improvised_civilian_trucks|Technical|  used by  |insurgents|Insurgency| , to modified  |IFVs|Infantry_Fighting_Vehicle| , such as variants of the  |M3_half_track|M3_Half-Track|  and  |M113_APC|M113_Armored_Personnel_Carrier| , to vehicles specifically intended to carry a mortar, such as the  |2S31_Vena|2S31_Vena| . The  |Israeli_Makmat|Postwar_Sherman_Tanks|  is a mortar carrier based on the  |M4_Sherman|M4_Sherman|  tank chassis.     The  |Russian_army|Russian_Ground_Forces|  uses a  2S4 Tyulpan  self-propelled 240  mm heavy mortar.  |Patria_Hägglunds|Patria_Hägglunds| , a joint venture between Finnish  |Patria|Patria|  and Swedish  |BAE_Systems_Hägglunds|Bae_Systems_Hägglunds|  manufactures  |AMOS|Amos|  , which is a 120  mm automatic twin barrelled,  |breech_loaded|Breech_Loaded|  mortar turret. There are also numerous AFVs and even MBTs that can be equipped with a mortar, either outside or inside of the cabin. The Israeli  |Merkava|Merkava| |MBT|Main_Battle_Tank|  carried a 60mm mortar in the small troop compartment in the rear, which fired through an opening in the roof, allowing the crew to remain protected. This was useful for fighting nearby infantry, as a mortar is shorter ranged and cheaper to shoot than the large main gun, as well as being better suited to wounding enemy infantry taking cover behind objects. However, since the mortar is only a secondary weapon in this case, the Merkava is not considered a mortar carrier.                Self-propelled artillery remains important in the equipment of many modern armies. It saw a significant role throughout the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  era conflicts and in the recent  |Gulf_Wars|Iraq_War| .     Modern SP artillery is highly computerized with the ability to self survey firing positions using systems such as  |GPS|Global_Positioning_System|  and  |inertial_navigation_systems|Inertial_Navigation_System| . This, in conjunction with digital  |fire_control|Fire_Control_System| /ballistic computers and digital communications, allows individual guns to disperse over a wide area and still  |deliver_rounds_on_target_simultaneously|Time_On_Target|  with the other guns in their battery.     These capabilities also increase survivability many fold as modern SP artillery can displace and avoid  |counterbattery_fire|Counterbattery_Fire|  much more quickly and effectively and, if desired, more frequently than previously possible. In conjunction with modern logistic systems with similar navigation systems and  |palletized|463L_Master_Pallet| |load_dropping|Air_Drop| / |lifting_capabilities|Air_Lift|  mean that the rapid displacement can occur without significant disruption to actually firing missions as it is possible for the ammunition to keep up with the guns.     A modern battery of six guns, each firing 43  kg projectiles with a burst  |firing_speed|Rate_Of_Fire|  of four rounds per minute, can deliver over a metric  |tonne|Tonne|  of ordnance per minute for up to four minutes. This is an immense  |weight_of_fire|Weight_Of_Fire| , which can be delivered with very high accuracy.     One example of the increased firepower provided by modern mobile howitzers is the latest version, the G6-52, of the 155  mm  |G6_howitzer|G6_Howitzer| . It can fire up to six rounds in quick succession that will land nearly simultaneously. This is achieved by firing the shells at different trajectories so that the first round has the longest flight time and the last round the shortest. This is an improvement of the concept of  |MRSI|Artillerymrsi|  , itself an enhancement of the earlier  |TOT|Time_On_Target|  concept. The necessary rapid reloading is made possible by an automated ammunition feed system.                Rockets have greater ranges and carry much more complex  |shells|Shell|  than guns since there is less of a restriction on size . The  |MLRS|Multiple_Rocket_Launcher|.
