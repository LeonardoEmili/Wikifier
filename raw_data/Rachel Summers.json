With this power, Korvus made short work of the other X-Men, but when Rachel blocked the sword, their minds were involuntarily linked. Through this link, Rachel learned that Korvus family was also murdered by the Shiar government because of their connection to the Phoenix. The remaining echo of the Phoenix power from the sword was then transferred to Rachel. Rachel claimed that rather than having taken the power, the power chose to go to her, saying, The Phoenix knows me, remember? It likes me. When this happened, Rachels normally gold energy aura turned blue, the same color as the Blade of the Phoenix. She then telekinetically disabled an explosive implant that the Shiar chancellor was using to force Korvus obedience.     Due to Rachels connection to Korvus through the sword, she discovers the Phoenix Force formerly in the blade is just an echo, a blue shadow , of the Force. The shadow of the Phoenix begins influencing Rachels behavior, causing her to design a new darker uniform and begin a romance with Korvus.
