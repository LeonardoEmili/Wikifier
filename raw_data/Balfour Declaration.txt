                             The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  announcing support for the establishment of a national home for the  |Jewish|Jewish|  people in  |Palestine|Palestine| , then an  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  region with a small minority Jewish population. It read:          The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2November 1917 from the United Kingdoms  |Foreign_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_Foreign_Affairs| |Arthur_Balfour|Arthur_Balfour|  to  |Lord_Rothschild|Walter_Rothschild,_2Nd_Baron_Rothschild| , a leader of the  |British_Jewish_community|British_Jews| , for transmission to the  |Zionist_Federation_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland|Zionist_Federation_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland| . The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9November 1917.     Immediately following their declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the  |British_War_Cabinet|British_War_Cabinet|  began to consider the future of Palestine; within two months  |a_memorandum_was_circulated_to_the_Cabinet|The_Future_Of_Palestine|  by a Zionist Cabinet member,  |Herbert_Samuel|Herbert_Samuel,_1St_Viscount_Samuel| , proposing the support of Zionist ambitions in order to enlist the support of Jews in the wider war.  |A_committee|De_Bunsen_Committee|  was established in April 1915 by  |British_Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| |H._H._Asquith|H._H._Asquith|  to determine their policy toward the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  including Palestine. Asquith, who had favoured post-war reform of the Ottoman Empire, resigned in December 1916; his replacement  |David_Lloyd_George|David_Lloyd_George| , favoured partition of the Empire. The first negotiations between the British and the  |Zionists|Zionism|  took place at a conference on 7 February 1917 that included  |Sir_Mark_Sykes|Mark_Sykes|  and the Zionist leadership. Subsequent discussions led to Balfours request, on 19 June, that Rothschild and  |Chaim_Weizmann|Chaim_Weizmann|  submit a draft of a public declaration. Further drafts were discussed by the British Cabinet during September and October, with input from Zionist and  |anti-Zionist|Anti-Zionism|  Jews but with no representation from the local population in Palestine.     By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of  |Britains_allies|Allies_Of_World_War_I|  not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were in the midst of a  |revolution|October_Revolution|  with  |Bolsheviks|Bolsheviks|  taking over the government. A  |stalemate_in_southern_Palestine|Stalemate_In_Southern_Palestine|  was broken by the  |Battle_of_Beersheba|Battle_Of_Beersheba|  on 31 October 1917. The release of the final declaration was authorised on 31 October; the preceding Cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst the worldwide Jewish community for the Allied war effort.     The opening words of the declaration represented the first public expression of support for Zionism by a major political power. The term national home had no precedent in international law, and was intentionally vague as to whether a  |Jewish_state|Jewish_State|  was contemplated. The intended boundaries of Palestine were not specified, and the British government later confirmed that the words in Palestine meant that the Jewish national home was not intended to cover all of Palestine. The second half of the declaration was added to satisfy opponents of the policy, who had claimed that it would otherwise prejudice the position of the local population of Palestine and encourage  |antisemitism|Antisemitism|  worldwide by stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands . The declaration called for safeguarding the civil and religious rights for the  |Palestinian_Arabs|Palestinian_Arabs| , who composed the  |vast_majority_of_the_local_population|Demographic_History_Of_Palestine| , and also the rights and political status of the Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The British government acknowledged in 1939 that the local populations views should have been taken into account, and recognised in 2017 that the declaration should have called for protection of the Palestinian Arabs political rights.     The declaration had many long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased popular support for  |Zionism|Zionism|  within  |Jewish_communities_worldwide|Jewish_Diaspora| , and became a core component of the  |British_Mandate_for_Palestine|British_Mandate_For_Palestine| , the founding document of  |Mandatory_Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine| , which later became  |Israel|Israel|  and the  |Palestinian_territories|Palestinian_Territories| . As a result, it is considered a principal cause of the ongoing  |Israeli–Palestinian_conflict|Israeli–Palestinian_Conflict| , often described as the worlds most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to  |the_Sharif_of_Mecca|Hussein_Ibn_Ali_Al-Hashimi|  in the  |McMahon–Hussein_correspondence|Mcmahon–Hussein_Correspondence| .                     Early British political support for an increased Jewish presence in the  |region_of_Palestine|Palestine|  was based upon geopolitical calculations. This support began in the early 1840s and was led by  |Lord_Palmerston|Henry_John_Temple,_3Rd_Viscount_Palmerston| , following the  |occupation_of_Syria|Egyptian–Ottoman_War|  and  |Palestine|Peasants_Revolt_In_Palestine|  by  |separatist|Separatism|  Ottoman governor  |Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt|Muhammad_Ali_Of_Egypt| . French influence had grown in Palestine and the wider Middle East, and its role as protector of the  |Catholic|Catholic_Church|  communities  |began_to_grow|Règlement_Organique| , just as Russian influence had grown as protector of the  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  in the same regions. This left Britain without a sphere of influence, and thus a need to find or create their own regional protégés . These political considerations were supported by a sympathetic evangelical Christian sentiment towards the  |restoration_of_the_Jews|Christian_Zionism|  to Palestine among elements of the mid-19th-century British political elite – most notably  |Lord_Shaftesbury|Anthony_Ashley-Cooper,_7Th_Earl_Of_Shaftesbury| . The British Foreign Office actively encouraged Jewish emigration to Palestine, exemplified by  |Charles_Henry_Churchills|Charles_Henry_Churchill|  1841–1842 exhortations to  |Moses_Montefiore|Moses_Montefiore| , the leader of the British Jewish community.     Such efforts were premature, and did not succeed; only 24,000 Jews were living in Palestine on the eve of the emergence of  |Zionism|Zionism|  within the worlds Jewish communities in the last two decades of the 19th century. With the geopolitical shakeup occasioned by the outbreak of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , the earlier calculations, which had lapsed for some time, led to a renewal of strategic assessments and political bargaining over the Middle and Far East.            Zionism arose in the late 19th century in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe.  |Romantic_nationalism|Romantic_Nationalism|  in  |Central|Central_Europe|  and  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe|  had helped to set off the  |Haskalah|Haskalah| , or Jewish Enlightenment , creating a split in the Jewish community between those who saw Judaism as their religion and those who saw it as their ethnicity or nation. The 1881–1884  |anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire|Anti-Jewish_Pogroms_In_The_Russian_Empire|  encouraged the growth of the latter identity, resulting in the formation of the  |Hovevei_Zion|Hovevei_Zion|  pioneer organizations, the publication of  |Leon_Pinskers|Leon_Pinsker|   Autoemancipation , and the first major wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine – retrospectively named the  |First_Aliyah|First_Aliyah|  .          In 1896,  |Theodor_Herzl|Theodor_Herzl| , a Jewish journalist living in  |Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary| , published the foundational text of political Zionism,  Der Judenstaat  , in which he asserted that the only solution to the  |Jewish_Question|Jewish_Question|  in Europe, including growing anti-Semitism, was the establishment of a state for the Jews. A year later, Herzl founded the  |Zionist_Organization|World_Zionist_Organization| , which at its  |first_congress|First_Zionist_Congress|  called for the establishment of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law . Proposed measures to attain that goal included the promotion of Jewish settlement there, the organisation of Jews in the  |diaspora|Jewish_Diaspora| , the strengthening of Jewish feeling and consciousness, and preparatory steps to attain necessary governmental grants. Herzl died in 1904, 44 years before the establishment of  |State_of_Israel|State_Of_Israel| , the Jewish state that he proposed, without having gained the political standing required to carry out his agenda.     Zionist leader  |Chaim_Weizmann|Chaim_Weizmann| , later President of the World Zionist Organisation and first  |President_of_Israel|President_Of_Israel| , moved from Switzerland to the UK in 1904 and met  |Arthur_Balfour|Arthur_Balfour|  – who had just launched his  |1905–1906_election_campaign|1906_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  after resigning as Prime Minister – in a session arranged by  |Charles_Dreyfus|Charles_Dreyfus| , his Jewish constituency representative. Earlier that year, Balfour had successfully driven the  |Aliens_Act|Aliens_Act_1905|  through Parliament with impassioned speeches regarding the need to restrict the wave of immigration into Britain from Jews fleeing the Russian Empire.  |Hansard|Hansard| , , HC Deb 10 July 1905 vol 149 cc110-62 During this meeting, he asked what Weizmanns objections had been to the 1903  |Uganda_Scheme|Uganda_Scheme|  that Herzl had supported to provide a portion of  |British_East_Africa|British_East_Africa|  to the Jewish people as a homeland. The scheme, which had been proposed to Herzl by  |Joseph_Chamberlain|Joseph_Chamberlain| ,  |Colonial_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_The_Colonies|  in Balfours Cabinet, following his trip to East Africa earlier in the year, had been subsequently voted down following Herzls death by the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 after two years of heated debate in the Zionist Organization. Weizmann responded that he believed the English are to London as the Jews are to Jerusalem.     In January 1914 Weizmann first met  |Baron_Edmond_de_Rothschild|Edmond_James_De_Rothschild| , a member of the  |French_branch_of_the_Rothschild_family|Rothschild_Banking_Family_Of_France|  and a leading proponent of the Zionist movement, in relation to a project to build a Hebrew university in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| . The Baron was not part of the World Zionist Organization, but had funded the  |Jewish_agricultural_colonies|Moshava|  of the First Aliyah and transferred them to the  |Jewish_Colonization_Association|Jewish_Colonization_Association|  in 1899. This connection was to bear fruit later that year when the Barons son,  |James_deRothschild|James_De_Rothschild| , requested a meeting with Weizmann on 25November 1914, to enlist him in influencing those deemed to be receptive within the British government to their agenda of a Jewish State in Palestine. Through Jamess wife  |Dorothy|Dorothy_De_Rothschild| , Weizmann was to meet  |Rózsika_Rothschild|Rózsika_Rothschild| , who introduced him to the  |English_branch_of_the_family|Rothschild_Banking_Family_Of_England| in particular her husband  |Charles|Charles_Rothschild|  and his older brother  |Walter|Walter_Rothschild,_2Nd_Baron_Rothschild| , a  |zoologist|Zoology|  and former  |member_of_parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  . Their father,  |Nathan_Rothschild,_1st_Baron_Rothschild|Nathan_Rothschild,_1St_Baron_Rothschild| , head of the English branch of the family, had a guarded attitude towards Zionism, but he died in March 1915 and his title was inherited by Walter.       Prior to the declaration, about 8,000 of Britains 300,000 Jews belonged to a Zionist organisation. Globally, as of 1913 – the latest known date prior to the declaration – the equivalent figure was approximately 1%.             The year 1916 marked four centuries since Palestine had  |become_part_of_the_Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman–Mamluk_War| , also known as the Turkish Empire. For most of this period, the Jewish population represented a small minority, approximately 3% of the total, with Muslims representing the largest segment of the population, and Christians the second.  and       Ottoman government in  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  began to apply restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, in response to the start of the  |First_Aliyah|First_Aliyah|  earlier that year. Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and  |notable|Ottoman_Ayan|  classes, in 1901 the  |Sublime_Porte|Sublime_Porte|  gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine and the percentage of Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914. At the same time, with growing distrust of the  |Young_Turks|Young_Turks|  – Turkish nationalists who had  |taken_control_of_the_Empire|Young_Turk_Revolution|  in 1908 – and the  |Second_Aliyah|Second_Aliyah| ,  |Arab_nationalism|Arab_Nationalism|  was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic. Historians do not know whether these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.                In July 1914 war broke out in Europe between the  |Triple_Entente|Triple_Entente|   and the  |Central_Powers|Central_Powers|  .     The  |British_Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  first discussed Palestine at a meeting on 9November 1914, four days after Britains declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire, of which the  |Mutasarrifate_of_Jerusalem|Mutasarrifate_Of_Jerusalem| often referred to as Palestinewas a component. At the meeting  |David_Lloyd_George|David_Lloyd_George| , then  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| , referred to the ultimate destiny of Palestine . The Chancellor, whose law firm Lloyd George, Roberts and Co had been engaged a decade before by the  |Zionist_Federation_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland|Zionist_Federation_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland|  to work on the  |Uganda_Scheme|Uganda_Scheme| , was to become Prime Minister by the time of the declaration, and was ultimately responsible for it.          Weizmanns political efforts picked up speed, and on 10December 1914 he met with  |Herbert_Samuel|Herbert_Samuel| , a British Cabinet member and a secular Jew who had studied Zionism; Samuel believed Weizmanns demands were too modest. Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, for the first time since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour had been out of government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the  |Conservative_Party|Conservative_Party|  in their role as  |Official_Opposition|Her_Majestys_Most_Loyal_Opposition| .     A month later, Samuel circulated a memorandum entitled  The Future of Palestine  to his Cabinet colleagues. The memorandum stated: I am assured that the solution of the problem of Palestine which would be much the most welcome to the leaders and supporters of the Zionist movement throughout the world would be the annexation of the country to the British Empire . Samuel discussed a copy of his memorandum with Nathan Rothschild in February 1915, a month before the latters death. It was the first time in an official record that enlisting the support of Jews as a war measure had been proposed.     Many further discussions followed, including the initial meetings in 1915–16 between Lloyd George, who had been appointed  |Minister_of_Munitions|Minister_Of_Munitions|  in May 1915, and Weizmann, who was appointed as a scientific advisor to the ministry in September 1915. Seventeen years later, in his War Memoirs, Lloyd George described these meetings as being the fount and origin of the declaration; historians have rejected this claim.             In late 1915 the  |British_High_Commissioner_to_Egypt|List_Of_Diplomats_Of_The_United_Kingdom_To_Egypt| ,  |Henry_McMahon|Henry_Mcmahon| ,  |exchanged_ten_letters|Mcmahon–Hussein_Correspondence|  with  |Hussein_bin_Ali,_Sharif_of_Mecca|Hussein_Bin_Ali,_Sharif_Of_Mecca| , in which he promised Hussein to recognize Arab independence in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca in return for Hussein launching a revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The pledge excluded portions of  |Syria|Syria|  lying to the west of the districts of Damascus,  |Homs|Homs| ,  |Hama|Hama|  and  |Aleppo|Aleppo|  . In the decades after the war, the extent of this coastal exclusion was hotly disputed since Palestine lay to the southwest of  |Damascus|Damascus|  and was not explicitly mentioned.        The  |Arab_Revolt|Arab_Revolt|  was launched on June5th, 1916, on the basis of the quid pro quo agreement in the correspondence. However, less than three weeks earlier the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Russia  |secretly_concluded|Secret_Treaty|  the  |Sykes–Picot_Agreement|Sykes–Picot_Agreement| , which Balfour described later as a wholly new method for dividing the region, after the 1915 agreement seems to have been forgotten .     This Anglo-French treaty was negotiated in late 1915 and early 1916 between Sir  |Mark_Sykes|Mark_Sykes|  and  |François_Georges-Picot|François_Georges-Picot| , with the primary arrangements being set out in draft form in a joint memorandum on 5 January 1916. Sykes was a British Conservative  |MP|Kingston_Upon_Hull_Central|  who had risen to a position of significant influence on Britains Middle East policy, beginning with his seat on the 1915  |De_Bunsen_Committee|De_Bunsen_Committee|  and his initiative to create the  |Arab_Bureau|Arab_Bureau| . Picot was a French diplomat and former  |consul-general|Consul_Consular_Rank|  in Beirut. Their agreement defined the proposed spheres of influence and control in Western Asia should the Triple Entente succeed in defeating the Ottoman Empire during World WarI,  dividing many Arab territories into British- and French-administered areas. In Palestine, internationalisation was proposed, with the form of administration to be confirmed after consultation with both Russia and Hussein; the January draft noted Christian and Muslim interests, and that members of the Jewish community throughout the world have a conscientious and sentimental interest in the future of the country.      Prior to this point, no active negotiations with Zionists had taken place, but Sykes had been aware of Zionism, was in contact with  |Moses_Gaster|Moses_Gaster|  – a former President of the English Zionist Federation – and may have seen Samuels 1915 memorandum. On 3 March, while Sykes and Picot were still in Petrograd,  |Lucien_Wolf|Lucien_Wolf|  submitted to the Foreign Office, the draft of an assurance that could be issued by the allies in support of Jewish aspirations:     In the event of Palestine coming within the spheres of influence of Great Britain or France at the close of the war, the governments of those powers will not fail to take account of the historic interest that country possesses for the Jewish community. The Jewish population will be secured in the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, equal political rights with the rest of the population, reasonable facilities for immigration and colonisation, and such municipal privileges in the towns and colonies inhabited by them as may be shown to be necessary.     On 11 March, telegrams  were sent in Greys name to Britains Russian and French ambassadors for transmission to Russian and French authorities, including the formula, as well as :     The scheme might be made far more attractive to the majority of Jews if it held out to them the prospect that when in course of time the Jewish colonists in Palestine grow strong enough to cope with the Arab population they may be allowed to take the management of the internal affairs of Palestine into their own hands.     Sykes, having seen the telegram, had discussions with Picot and proposed  the creation of an Arab Sultanate under French and British protection, some means of administering the holy places along with the establishment of a company to purchase land for Jewish colonists, who would then become citizens with equal rights to Arabs.     Shortly after returning from Petrograd, Sykes briefed Samuel, who then briefed a meeting of Gaster, Weizmann and Sokolow. Gaster recorded in his diary on 16 April 1916: We are offered French-English condominium in Palest Arab Prince to conciliate Arab sentiment and as part of the Constitution a Charter to Zionists for which England would stand guarantee and which would stand by us in every case of friction... It practically comes to a complete realisation of our Zionist programme. However, we insisted on: national character of Charter, freedom of immigration and internal autonomy, and at the same time full rights of citizenship to and Jews in Palestine.  In Sykes mind, the agreement which bore his name was outdated even before it was signed – in March 1916, he wrote in a private letter: to my mind the Zionists are now the key of the situation . In the event, neither the French nor the Russians were enthusiastic about the proposed formulation and eventually on 4 July, Wolf was informed that the present moment is inopportune for making any announcement.      These wartime initiatives, inclusive of the declaration, are frequently considered together by historians because of the potential, real or imagined, for incompatibility between them, particularly in regard to the disposition of Palestine. In the words of Professor  |Albert_Hourani|Albert_Hourani| , founder of the Middle East Centre at  |St_Antonys_College,_Oxford|St_Antonys_College,_Oxford|          In terms of British politics, the declaration resulted from the coming into power of  |Lloyd_George_and_his_Cabinet|Lloyd_George_Ministry| , which had replaced the  |H._H._Asquith_led-Cabinet|Asquith_Coalition_Ministry|  in December 1916. Whilst both Prime Ministers were  |Liberals|Liberal_Party|  and both governments were  |wartime_coalitions|Coalition_Government| , Lloyd George and Balfour, appointed as his Foreign Secretary, favoured a post-war partition of the Ottoman Empire as a major British war aim, whereas Asquith and his Foreign Secretary,  |Sir_Edward_Grey|Edward_Grey,_1St_Viscount_Grey_Of_Fallodon| , had favoured its reform.     Two days after taking office, Lloyd George told  |General_Robertson|Sir_William_Robertson,_1St_Baronet| , the  |Chief_of_the_Imperial_General_Staff|Chief_Of_The_General_Staff| , that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| , to impress British public opinion, and immediately consulted his War Cabinet about a further campaign into Palestine when El Arish had been secured.  Subsequent pressure from Lloyd George, over the reservations of Robertson, resulted in the recapture of the  |Sinai|Sinai_Peninsula|  for  |British-controlled_Egypt|Khedivate_Of_Egypt| , and, with the  |capture_of_El_Arish|Battle_Of_Magdhaba|  in December 1916  |and_Rafah|Battle_Of_Rafa|  in January 1917, the arrival of British forces at the southern borders of the Ottoman Empire. Following two unsuccessful  |attempts_to_capture_Gaza|Second_Battle_Of_Gaza|  between 26 March and 19 April, a six-month  |stalemate_in_Southern_Palestine|Stalemate_In_Southern_Palestine|  began; the  |Sinai_and_Palestine_Campaign|Sinai_And_Palestine_Campaign|  would not make any progress into Palestine until 31October 1917.         Following the change in government, Sykes was promoted into the War Cabinet Secretariat with responsibility for Middle Eastern affairs. In January 1917, despite having previously built a relationship with Moses Gaster, he began looking to meet other Zionist leaders; by the end of the month he had been introduced to Weizmann and his associate  |Nahum_Sokolow|Nahum_Sokolow| , a journalist and executive of the World Zionist Organization who had moved to Britain at the beginning of the war.     On 7February 1917, Sykes, claiming to be acting in a private capacity, entered into substantive discussions with the Zionist leadership. The previous British correspondence with the Arabs was discussed at the meeting; Sokolows notes record Sykes description that The Arabs professed that language must be the measure and could claim all Syria and Palestine. Still the Arabs could be managed, particularly if they received Jewish support in other matters.  At this point the Zionists were still unaware of the  |Sykes-Picot_Agreement|Sykes-Picot_Agreement| , although they had their suspicions. One of Sykes goals was the mobilization of Zionism to the cause of British suzerainty in Palestine, so as to have arguments to put to France in support of that objective.          During the period of the British War Cabinet discussions leading up to the declaration, the war had reached a period of stalemate. On the  |Western_Front|Western_Front|  the tide would first turn in favour of the Central Powers in  |spring_1918|Spring_Offensive| , before decisively  |turning_in_favour_of_the_Allies|Second_Battle_Of_The_Marne|  from July 1918 onwards. Although the United States declared war on Germany in the spring of 1917, it did not suffer its first casualties until 2 November 1917, at which point President  |Woodrow_Wilson|Woodrow_Wilson|  still hoped to avoid dispatching large contingents of troops into the war. The Russian forces were known to be distracted by the ongoing  |Russian_Revolution|Russian_Revolution|  and the growing support for the  |Bolshevik|Bolshevik|  faction, but  |Alexander_Kerenskys|Alexander_Kerensky| |Provisional_Government|Russian_Provisional_Government|  had remained in the war; Russia only withdrew after the final stage of the revolution  |on_7November_1917|October_Revolution| .             Balfour met Weizmann at the Foreign Office on 22 March 1917; two days later, Weizmann described the meeting as being the first time I had a real business talk with him . Weizmann explained at the meeting that the Zionists had a preference for a British protectorate over Palestine, as opposed to an American, French or international arrangement; Balfour agreed, but warned that there may be difficulties with France and Italy .     The French position in regard to Palestine and the wider  |Syria_region|Syria|  during the lead up to the Balfour Declaration was largely dictated by the terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and was complicated from 23 November 1915 by increasing French awareness of the British discussions with the Sherif of Mecca. Prior to 1917, the British had led the fighting on the southern border of the Ottoman Empire alone, given their neighbouring  |Egyptian_colony|History_Of_Egypt_Under_The_British|  and the French preoccupation with the fighting on the Western Front that was taking place on their own soil. Italys participation in the war, which began following the April 1915  |Treaty_of_London|Treaty_Of_London| , did not include involvement in the Middle Eastern sphere until the April 1917  |Agreement_of_Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne|Agreement_Of_Saint-Jean-De-Maurienne| ; at this conference, Lloyd George had raised the question of a British protectorate of Palestine and the idea had been very coldly received by the French and the Italians. In May and June 1917, the French and Italians sent  |detachments|Detachment|  to support the British as they built their reinforcements in preparation for a renewed attack on Palestine.     In early April, Sykes and Picot were appointed to act as the chief negotiators once more, this time on a month-long mission to the Middle East for further discussions with the Sherif of Mecca and other Arab leaders. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while not prejudicing the Zionist movement and the possibility of its development under British auspices, enter into any political pledges to the Arabs, and particularly none in regard to Palestine . Before travelling to the Middle East, Picot, via Sykes, invited Nahum Sokolow to Paris to educate the French government on Zionism. Sykes, who had prepared the way in correspondence with Picot, arrived a few days after Sokolow; in the meantime Sokolow had met Picot and other French officials, and convinced the French Foreign Office to accept for study a statement of Zionist aims in regard to facilities of colonization, communal autonomy, rights of language and establishment of a Jewish chartered company.  Sykes went on ahead to Italy and had meetings with the British ambassador and British Vatican representative to prepare the way for Sokolow once again.     Sokolow was granted an audience with  |Pope_Benedict_XV|Pope_Benedict_Xv|  on 6 May 1917. Sokolows notes of the meeting – the only meeting records known to historians – stated that the Pope expressed general sympathy and support for the Zionist project. On 21 May 1917 Angelo Sereni, president of the  |Committee_of_the_Jewish_Communities|Union_Of_Italian_Jewish_Communities| , presented Sokolow to  |Sidney_Sonnino|Sidney_Sonnino| , the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was also received by  |Paolo_Boselli|Paolo_Boselli| , the Italian prime minister. Sonnino arranged for the secretary general of the ministry to send a letter to the effect that, although he could not express himself on the merits of a program which concerned all the allies, generally speaking he was not opposed to the legitimate claims of the Jews. On his return journey, Sokolow met with French leaders again and secured a  |letter|Cambon_Letter|  dated 4 June 1917, giving assurances of sympathy towards the Zionist cause by  |Jules_Cambon|Jules_Cambon| , head of the political section of the French foreign ministry. This letter was not published, but was deposited at the British Foreign Office.     Following the United States entry into the war on 6 April, the British Foreign Secretary led the  |Balfour_Mission|Balfour_Mission|  to  |Washington_D.C.|Washington_D.C.|  and  |New_York|New_York_City| , where he spent a month between mid-April and mid-May. During the trip he spent significant time discussing Zionism with  |Louis_Brandeis|Louis_Brandeis| , a leading Zionist and a close ally of Wilson who had been appointed as a  |Supreme_Court_Justice|Associate_Justice_Of_The_Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States|  a year previously.            By 13 June 1917, it was acknowledged by  |Ronald_Graham|Ronald_William_Graham| , head of the Foreign Offices Middle Eastern affairs department, that the three most relevant politiciansthe Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and the  |Parliamentary_Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs|Parliamentary_Under-Secretary_Of_State_For_Foreign_Affairs| ,  |Lord_Robert_Cecil|Robert_Cecil,_1St_Viscount_Cecil_Of_Chelwood| were all in favour of Britain supporting the Zionist movement; on the same day Weizmann had written to Graham to advocate for a public declaration.  |Palestine_and_the_Balfour_Declaration,_Cabinet_Paper,_January_1923|:File:Palestine_And_The_Balfour_Declaration,_Cabinet_Paper,_January_1923.Jpg|       Six days later, at a meeting on 19June, Balfour asked Lord Rothschild and Weizmann to submit a formula for a declaration. Over the next few weeks, a 143-word draft was prepared by the Zionist negotiating committee, but it was considered too specific on sensitive areas by Sykes, Graham and Rothschild. Separately, a very different draft had been prepared by the Foreign Office, described in 1961 by  |Harold_Nicolson|Harold_Nicolson|  – who had been involved in preparing the draft – as proposing a sanctuary for Jewish victims of persecution . The Foreign Office draft was strongly opposed by the Zionists, and was discarded; no copy of the draft has been found in the Foreign Office archives.     Following further discussion, a revised – and at just 46 words in length, much shorter – draft declaration was prepared and sent by Lord Rothschild to Balfour on 18 July. It was received by the Foreign Office, and the matter was brought to the Cabinet for formal consideration.            The decision to release the declaration was taken by the British War Cabinet on 31 October 1917. This followed discussion at four War Cabinet meetings over the space of the previous two months. In order to aid the discussions, the War Cabinet Secretariat, led by  |Maurice_Hankey|Maurice_Hankey,_1St_Baron_Hankeylloyd_Georges_War_Cabinet|  and supported by his  |Assistant_Secretaries|Assistant_Secretary| |Hansard|Hansard| ,  |Leo_Amery|Leo_Amery|  – solicited outside perspectives to put before the Cabinet. These included the views of government ministers, war allies – notably from President Woodrow Wilson – and in October, formal submissions from six Zionist leaders and four non-Zionist Jews.     British officials asked President Wilson for his consent on the matter on two occasions – first on 3 September, when he replied the time was not ripe, and later on 6 October, when he agreed with the release of the declaration.     Excerpts from the minutes of these four War Cabinet meetings provide a description of the primary factors that the ministers considered:     3 September 1917: With reference to a suggestion that the matter might be postponed, pointed out that this was a question on which the Foreign Office had been very strongly pressed for a long time past. There was a very strong and enthusiastic organisation, more particularly in the United States, who were zealous in this matter, and his belief was that it would be of most substantial assistance to the Allies to have the earnestness and enthusiasm of these people enlisted on our side. To do nothing was to risk a direct breach with them, and it was necessary to face this situation.  4 October 1917: ... stated that the German Government were making great efforts to capture the sympathy of the Zionist Movement. This Movement, though opposed by a number of wealthy Jews in this country, had behind it the support of a majority of Jews, at all events in Russia and America, and possibly in other countries ... Mr. Balfour then read a very sympathetic  |declaration|Cambon_Letter|  by the French Government which had been conveyed to the Zionists, and he stated that he knew that President Wilson was extremely favourable to the Movement.  25 October 1917: ... the Secretary mentioned that he was being pressed by the Foreign Office to bring forward the question of Zionism, an early settlement of which was regarded as of great importance.       31 October 1917: stated that he gathered that everyone was now agreed that, from a purely diplomatic and political point of view, it was desirable that some declaration favourable to the aspirations of the Jewish nationalists should now be made. The vast majority of Jews in Russia and America, as, indeed, all over the world, now appeared to be favourable to Zionism. If we could make a declaration favourable to such an ideal, we should be able to carry on extremely useful propaganda both in Russia and America.          Declassification of British government archives has allowed scholars to piece together the choreography of the drafting of the declaration; in his widely cited 1961 book,  |Leonard_Stein|Leonard_Stein|  published four previous drafts of the declaration.      A month after the receipt of the much-reduced 12 July draft from Rothschild, Balfour proposed a number of mainly technical amendments. The two subsequent drafts included much more substantial amendments: the first in a late August draft by  |Lord_Milner|Alfred_Milner|  – one of the original five members of Lloyd Georges War Cabinet as a  |minister_without_portfolio|Minister_Without_Portfolio|  – which reduced the geographic scope from all of Palestine to in Palestine , and the second from Milner and Amery in early October, which added the two safeguard clauses .          Subsequent authors have debated who the primary author really was. In his posthumously published 1981 book  The Anglo-American Establishment ,  |Georgetown_University|Georgetown_University|  history professor  |Carroll_Quigley|Carroll_Quigley|  explained his view that Lord Milner was the primary author of the declaration, and more recently,  |William_D._Rubinstein|William_D._Rubinstein| , Professor of Modern History at  |Aberystwyth_University|Aberystwyth_University| , Wales, proposed Amery instead. Huneidi wrote that Ormsby-Gore, in a report he prepared for Shuckburgh, claimed authorship, together with Amery, of the final draft form.         The agreed version of the declaration, a single sentence of just 67 words, was sent on 2November 1917 in a short letter from Balfour to Walter Rothschild, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The declaration contained four  |clauses|Clause| , of which the first two promised to support the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people , followed by two safeguard clauses  with respect to the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine , and the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country .               The term national home was intentionally ambiguous, having no legal value or precedent in international law, such that its meaning was unclear when compared to other terms such as state . The term was intentionally used instead of state because of opposition to the Zionist program within the British Cabinet. According to historian Norman Rose, the chief architects of the declaration contemplated that a  |Jewish_State|Jewish_State|  would emerge in time while the  |Palestine_Royal_Commission|Palestine_Royal_Commission|  concluded that the wording was the outcome of a compromise between those Ministers who contemplated the ultimate establishment of a Jewish State and those who did not.         Interpretation of the wording has been sought in the correspondence leading to the final version of the declaration. An official report to the War Cabinet sent by Sykes on 22 September said that the Zionists did not want to set up a Jewish Republic or any other form of state in Palestine or in any part of Palestine but rather preferred some form of protectorate as provided in the Palestine Mandate. A month later, Curzon produced a memorandum circulated on 26 October 1917 where he addressed two questions, the first concerning the meaning of the phrase a National Home for the Jewish race in Palestine ; he noted that there were different opinions ranging from a fully fledged state to a merely spiritual centre for the Jews.     Sections of the British press assumed that a Jewish state was intended even before the Declaration was finalized. In the United States the press began using the terms Jewish National Home , Jewish State , Jewish republic and Jewish Commonwealth interchangeably. American Emergency Committee for Zionist Affairs, The Balfour Declaration and American Interests in Palestine pp. 8-10.     Treaty expert  |David_Hunter_Miller|David_Hunter_Miller| , who was at the conference and subsequently compiled a 22 volume compendium of documents, provides a report of the Intelligence Section of the American Delegation to the  |Paris_Peace_Conference_of_1919|Paris_Peace_Conference_Of_1919|  which recommended that there be established a separate state in Palestine, and that it will be the policy of the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  to recognize Palestine as a Jewish state, as soon as it is a Jewish state in fact.  Miller, David Hunter. My Diary at the Conference of Paris , Appeal Printing Co., , vol 4 pp. 263-4 The report further advised that an independent Palestinian state under a  |British_League_of_Nations_mandate|British_Mandate_For_Palestine|  be created. Jewish settlement would be allowed and encouraged in this state and this states holy sites would be under the control of the League of Nations. Indeed,  |the_Inquiry|The_Inquiry|  spoke positively about the possibility of a Jewish state eventually being created in Palestine if the necessary demographics for this were to exist.     Historian Matthew Jacobs later wrote that the US approach was hampered by the general absence of specialist knowledge about the region and that like much of the Inquirys work on the Middle East, the reports on Palestine were deeply flawed and presupposed a particular outcome of the conflict . He quotes Miller, writing about one report on the history and impact of Zionism, absolutely inadequate from any standpoint and must be regarded as nothing more than material for a future report       |Lord_Robert_Cecil|Lord_Robert_Cecil|  on 2 December 1917, assured an audience that the government fully intended that Judea for the Jews.  Yair Auron opines that Cecil, then a deputy Foreign Secretary representing the British Government at a celebratory gathering of the English Zionist Federation, possibly went beyond his official brief in saying Our wish is that Arabian countries shall be for the Arabs, Armenia for the Armenians and Judaea for the Jews .     The following October  |Neville_Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain| , while chairing a Zionist meeting, discussed a new Jewish State. At the time, Chamberlain was a Member of Parliament for Ladywood, Birmingham; recalling the event in 1939, just after Chamberlain had approved the 1939 White Paper, the Jewish Telegraph Agency noted that the Prime Minister had experienced a pronounced change of mind in the 21 years intervening  A year later, on the Declarations second anniversary, General  |Jan_Smuts|Jan_Smuts|  said that Britain would redeem her pledge ... and a great Jewish state would ultimately rise.  In similar vein, Churchill a few months later stated:        At the 22 June 1921 meeting of the Imperial Cabinet, Churchill was asked by Arthur Meighen, the Canadian Prime Minister, about the meaning of the national home. Churchill said If in the course of many years they become a majority in the country, they naturally would take it over....pro rata with the Arab. We made an equal pledge that we would not turn the Arab off his land or invade his political and social rights .      Responding to Curzon in January 1919, Balfour wrote Weizmann has never put forward a claim for the Jewish Government of Palestine. Such a claim in my opinion is clearly inadmissible and personally I do not think we should go further than the original declaration which I made to Lord Rothschild .     In February 1919, France issued a statement that it would not oppose putting Palestine under British trusteeship and the formation of a Jewish State. Friedman further notes that Frances attitude went on to change; Yehuda Blum, while discussing Frances unfriendly attitude towards the Jewish national movement , notes the content of a report made by Robert Vansittart to Curzon in November 1920 which said:        Greeces Foreign Minister told the editor of the Salonica Jewish organ Pro-Israel that the establishment of a Jewish State meets in Greece with full and sincere sympathy ... A Jewish Palestine would become an ally of Greece.  In  |Switzerland|Switzerland| , a number of noted historians including professors Tobler, Forel-Yvorne, and Rogaz, supported the idea of establishing a Jewish state, with one referring to it as a sacred right of the Jews.  While in  |Germany|Germany| , officials and most of the press took the Declaration to mean a British sponsored state for the Jews.     The British government, including Churchill, made it clear that the Declaration did not intend for the whole of Palestine to be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded in Palestine.   |Emir_Faisal|Faisal_I_Of_Iraq| , King of Syria and Iraq, made a formal written agreement with Zionist leader  |Chaim_Weizmann|Chaim_Weizmann| , which was drafted by T.E. Lawrence, whereby they would try to establish a peaceful relationship between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. Sekulow, Jay. Unholy Alliance: The Agenda Iran, Russia, and Jihadists Share for Conquering the World, Simon and Schuster pp. 29-30 The 3 January 1919  |Faisal–Weizmann_Agreement|Faisal–Weizmann_Agreement|  was a short-lived agreement for Arab–Jewish cooperation on the development of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Faisal did treat Palestine differently in his presentation to the Peace Conference on 6 February 1919 saying Palestine, for its universal character, left on one side for the mutual consideration of all parties concerned .  The agreement was never implemented. In a subsequent letter written in English by Lawrence for Faisals signature, he explained:   When the letter was tabled at the  |Shaw_Commission|Shaw_Commission|  in 1929,  |Rustam_Haidar|Rustam_Haidar|  spoke to Faisal in Baghdad and cabled that Faisal had no recollection that he wrote anything of the sort . In January 1930, Haidar wrote to a newspaper in Baghdad that Faisal: finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed to him as he at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an Arab country .  |Awni_Abd_al-Hadi|Awni_Abd_Al-Hadi| , Faisals secretary, wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between Frankfurter and Faisal took place and that: I believe that this letter, assuming that it is authentic, was written by Lawrence, and that Lawrence signed it in English on behalf of Faisal. I believe this letter is part of the false claims made by Chaim Weizmann and Lawrence to lead astray public opinion.  According to Allawi, the most likely explanation for the Frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place, a letter was drafted in English by Lawrence, but that its contents were not entirely made clear to Faisal. He then may or may not have been induced to sign it , since it ran counter to Faisals other public and private statements at the time. A 1 March interview by Le Matin quoted Faisal as saying:   This feeling of respect for other religions dictates my opinion about Palestine, our neighbor. That the unhappy Jews come to reside there and behave as good citizens of this country, our humanity rejoices given that they are placed under a Muslim or Christian government mandated by The League of Nations. If they want to constitute a state and claim sovereign rights in this region, I foresee very serious dangers. It is to be feared that there will be a conflict between them and the other races.       Referring to his 1922  |White_Paper|Churchill_White_Paper| , Churchill later wrote that there is nothing in it to prohibit the ultimate establishment of a Jewish State.  And in private, many British officials agreed with the Zionists interpretation that a state would be established when a Jewish majority was achieved.     When Chaim Weizmann met with Churchill, Lloyd George and Balfour at Balfours home in London on 21 July 1921, Lloyd George and Balfour assured Weizmann that by the Declaration they had always meant an eventual Jewish State, according to Weizmann minutes of that meeting.  Lloyd George stated in 1937 that it was intended that Palestine would become a Jewish Commonwealth if and when Jews had become a definite majority of the inhabitants , and Leo Amery echoed the same position in 1946. In the UNSCOP report of 1947, the issue of home versus state was subjected to scrutiny arriving at a similar conclusion to that of Lloyd George.         The statement that such a homeland would be found in Palestine rather than of Palestine was also deliberate. The proposed draft of the declaration contained in Rothschilds 12 July letter to Balfour referred to the principle that Palestine should be reconstituted as the National Home of the Jewish people.  In the final text, following Lord Milners amendment, the word reconstituted was removed and the word that was replaced with in .     This text thereby avoided committing the entirety of Palestine as the National Home of the Jewish people, resulting in controversy in future years over the intended scope, especially the  |Revisionist_Zionism|Revisionist_Zionism|  sector, which claimed entirety of  |Mandatory_Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine|  and  |Emirate_of_Transjordan|Emirate_Of_Transjordan|  as  |Jewish_Homeland|Jewish_Homeland|   This was clarified by the 1922 Churchill White Paper, which wrote that the terms of the declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded in Palestine.      The declaration did not include any geographical boundaries for Palestine. Following the end of the war, three documents – the declaration, the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence and the Sykes-Picot Agreement – became the basis for the negotiations to set the boundaries of Palestine.              The declarations first safeguard clause referred to protecting the  |civil_and_religious_rights|Human_Rights|  of non-Jews in Palestine. The clause had been drafted together with the second safeguard by Leo Amery in consultation with Lord Milner, with the intention to go a reasonable distance to meeting the objectors, both Jewish and pro-Arab, without impairing the substance of the proposed declaration .     The non-Jews constituted 90% of the population of Palestine; in the words of  |Ronald_Storrs|Ronald_Storrs| , Britains Military Governor of Jerusalem between 1917 and 1920, the community observed that they had been not so much as named, either as Arabs, Moslems or Christians, but were lumped together under the negative and humiliating definition of Non-Jewish Communities and relegated to subordinate provisos . The community also noted that there was no reference to protecting their political status or political rights, as there was in the subsequent safeguard relating to Jews in other countries. This protection was frequently contrasted against the commitment to the Jewish community, and over the years a variety of terms were used to refer to these two obligations as a pair; a particularly heated question was whether these two obligations had equal weight , and in 1930 this equal status was confirmed by the  |Permanent_Mandates_Commission|Permanent_Mandates_Commission|  and by the British government in the  |Passfield_white_paper|Passfield_White_Paper| .     Balfour stated in February 1919 that Palestine was considered an exceptional case in which, referring to the local population, we deliberately and rightly decline to accept the principle of  |self-determination|Self-Determination| ,  although he considered that the policy provided self-determination to Jews. Avi Shlaim considers this the declarations greatest contradiction . This principle of self-determination had been declared on numerous occasions subsequent to the declarationPresident Wilsons January 1918  |Fourteen_Points|Fourteen_Points| , McMahons Declaration to the Seven in June 1918, the November 1918  |Anglo-French_Declaration|Anglo-French_Declaration| , and the June 1919  |Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations|Covenant_Of_The_League_Of_Nations|  that had established the  |mandate_system|League_Of_Nations_Mandate| . In an August 1919 memo Balfour acknowledged the inconsistency among these statements, and further explained that the British had no intention of consulting the existing population of Palestine. The results of the ongoing American  |King–Crane_Commission_of_Enquiry_consultation|King–Crane_Commission|  of the local population – from which the British had withdrawn – were suppressed for three years until the report was leaked in 1922. Subsequent British governments have acknowledged this deficiency, in particular the 1939 committee led by the  |Lord_Chancellor|Lord_Chancellor| ,  |Frederic_Maugham|Frederic_Maugham,_1St_Viscount_Maugham| , which concluded that the government had not been free to dispose of Palestine without regard for the wishes and interests of the inhabitants of Palestine , and the April 2017 statement by British Foreign Office minister of state  |Baroness_Anelay|Joyce_Anelay,_Baroness_Anelay_Of_St_Johns|  that the government acknowledged that the Declaration should have called for the protection of political rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, particularly their right to self-determination.             The second safeguard clause was a commitment that nothing should be done which might prejudice the rights of the Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The original drafts of Rothschild, Balfour, and Milner did not include this safeguard, which was drafted together with the preceding safeguard in early October, in order to reflect opposition from influential members of the Anglo-Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.     The Conjoint Foreign Committee of the  |Board_of_Deputies_of_British_Jews|Board_Of_Deputies_Of_British_Jews|  and the  |Anglo-Jewish_Association|Anglo-Jewish_Association|  had published a letter in  The Times  on 24 May 1917 entitled Views of Anglo-Jewry, signed by the two organisations presidents,  |David_Lindo_Alexander|David_Lindo_Alexander|  and  |Claude_Montefiore|Claude_Montefiore| , stating their view that: the establishment of a Jewish nationality in Palestine, founded on this theory of homelessness, must have the effect throughout the world of stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands, and of undermining their hard-won position as citizens and nationals of these lands.  This was followed in late August by  |Edwin_Montagu|Edwin_Montagu| , an influential  |anti-Zionist|Anti-Zionist|  Jew and  |Secretary_of_State_for_India|Secretary_Of_State_For_India| , and the only Jewish member of the British Cabinet, who wrote in a Cabinet memorandum that: The policy of His Majestys Government is anti-Semitic in result and will prove a rallying ground for anti-Semites in every country of the world.          The text of the declaration was published in the press one week after it was signed, on 9November 1917. Other related events took place within a short timeframe, the two most relevant being the almost immediate British military capture of Palestine and the leaking of the previously secret Sykes-Picot Agreement. On the military side, both  |Gaza|Third_Battle_Of_Gaza|  and  |Jaffa_fell|Battle_Of_Jaffa|  within several days, and  |Jerusalem_was_surrendered|Battle_Of_Jerusalem|  to the British on 9 December. The publication of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, following the Russian Revolution, in the Bolshevik  Izvestia  and  Pravda  on 23 November 1917 and in the British  Manchester Guardian  on 26 November 1917, represented a dramatic moment for the Allies Eastern campaign: the British were embarrassed, the Arabs dismayed and the Turks delighted.  |Peter_Mansfield|Peter_Mansfield| , The British Empire  magazine, no. 75, Time-Life Books, 1973 The Zionists had been aware of the outlines of the agreement since April and specifically the part relevant to Palestine, following a meeting between Weizmann and Cecil where Weizmann made very clear his objections to the proposed scheme.            The declaration represented the first public support for Zionism by a major political power – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter. In addition to its publication in major newspapers, leaflets were circulated throughout Jewish communities. These leaflets were  |airdrop|Airdrop| ped over Jewish communities in Germany and Austria, as well as the  |Pale_of_Settlement|Pale_Of_Settlement| , which  |had_been_given_to_the_Central_Powers|Treaty_Of_Brest-Litovsk|  following the Russian withdrawal.     Weizmann had argued that the declaration would have three effects: it would swing Russia to maintain pressure on Germanys  |Eastern_Front|Eastern_Front| , since Jews had been prominent in the  |March_Revolution_of_1917|February_Revolution| ; it would rally the large Jewish community in the United States to press for greater funding for the  |American_war_effort|American_Entry_Into_World_War_I| , underway since April of that year; and, lastly, that it would undermine German Jewish support for  |Kaiser_Wilhelm_II|Wilhelm_Ii,_German_Emperor| .     The declaration spurred an unintended and extraordinary increase in the number of adherents of American Zionism; in 1914 the 200 American Zionist societies comprised a total of 7,500 members, which grew to 30,000 members in 600 societies in 1918 and 149,000 members in 1919. Whilst the British had considered that the declaration reflected a previously established dominance of the Zionist position in Jewish thought, it was the declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for Zionisms legitimacy and leadership.     Exactly one month after the declaration was issued, a large-scale celebration took place at the  |Royal_Opera_House|Royal_Opera_House|  – speeches were given by leading Zionists as well as members of the British administration including Sykes and Cecil. From 1918 until the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , Jews in  |Mandatory_Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine|  celebrated  |Balfour_Day|Balfour_Day|  as an annual national holiday on 2November. The celebrations included ceremonies in schools and other public institutions and festive articles in the Hebrew press. In August 1919 Balfour approved Weizmanns request to name the first post-war settlement in Mandatory Palestine,  |Balfouria|Balfouria|  , in his honour. It was intended to be a model settlement for future American Jewish activity in Palestine.     Herbert Samuel, the Zionist MP whose 1915 memorandum had framed the start of discussions in the British Cabinet, was asked by Lloyd George on 24April 1920 to act as the first  |civil_governor_of_British_Palestine|High_Commissioners_For_Palestine_And_Transjordan| , replacing the  |previous_military_administration|Occupied_Enemy_Territory_Administration|  that had ruled the area since the war. Shortly after beginning the role in July 1920, he was invited to read the  haftarah  from  |Isaiah_40|Isaiah_40|  at the  |Hurva_Synagogue|Hurva_Synagogue|  in Jerusalem, which, according to his memoirs, led the congregation of older settlers to feel that the fulfilment of ancient prophecy might at last be at hand .            The local Christian and Muslim community of Palestine, who constituted  |almost_90%_of_the_population|Demographic_History_Of_Palestine| , strongly opposed the declaration. As described by the Palestinian-American philosopher  |Edward_Said|Edward_Said|  in 1979, it was perceived as being made: by a European power, about a non-European territory, in a flat disregard of both the presence and the wishes of the native majority resident in that territory, and it took the form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign group.      According to the 1919 King–Crane Commission, No British officer, consulted by the Commissioners, believed that the Zionist programme could be carried out except by force of arms.  A delegation of the  |Muslim-Christian_Association|Muslim-Christian_Associations| , headed by  |Musa_al-Husayni|Musa_Al-Husayni| , expressed public disapproval on 3November 1918, one day after the Zionist Commission parade marking the first anniversary of the Balfour Declaration. They handed a petition signed by more than 100 notables to Ronald Storrs, the British military governor:        The group also protested the carrying of new white and blue banners with two inverted triangles in the middle , drawing the attention of the British authorities to the serious consequences of any political implications in raising the banners.  Later that month, on the first anniversary of the occupation of  |Jaffa|Jaffa|  by the British, the Muslim-Christian Association sent a lengthy memorandum and petition to the military governor protesting once more any formation of a Jewish state.         In the broader Arab world, the declaration was seen as a betrayal of the British wartime understandings with the Arabs. The Sharif of Mecca and other Arab leaders considered the declaration a violation of a previous commitment made in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence in exchange for launching the Arab Revolt.     Following the publication of the declaration, the British dispatched Commander  |David_George_Hogarth|David_George_Hogarth|  to see Hussein in January 1918 bearing  |the_message|Hogarth_Message|  that the political and economic freedom of the Palestinian population was not in question. Hogarth reported that Hussein would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain . Hussein had also learned of the Sykes–Picot Agreement when it was leaked by the new  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  government in December 1917, but was satisfied by  |two_disingenuous_messages|Bassett_Letter|  from Sir  |Reginald_Wingate|Reginald_Wingate| , who had replaced McMahon as High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him that the British commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes–Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty.     Continuing Arab disquiet over Allied intentions also led during 1918 to the British  |Declaration_to_the_Seven|Declaration_To_The_Seven|  and the Anglo-French Declaration, the latter promising the complete and final liberation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the Turks, and the setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations .  , UNISPAL, Annex  A, paragraph  19.     In 1919, King Hussein refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. After February, 1920, the British ceased to pay subsidy to him. In August, 1920, five days after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, which formally recognized the Kingdom of Hejaz, Curzon asked Cairo to procure Husseins signature to both treaties and agreed to make a payment of £30,000 conditional on signature. Hussein declined and in 1921, stated that he could not be expected to affix his name to a document assigning Palestine to the Zionists and Syria to foreigners.  Following the 1921 Cairo Conference, Lawrence was sent to try and obtain the Kings signature to a treaty as well as to Versailles and Sèvres, a £60,000 annual subsidy being proposed; this attempt also failed. During 1923, the British made one further attempt to settle outstanding issues with Hussein and once again, the attempt foundered, Hussein continued in his refusal to recognize the Balfour Declaration or any of the Mandates that he perceived as being his domain. In March 1924, having briefly considered the possibility of removing the offending article from the treaty, the government suspended any further negotiations; within six months they withdrew their support in favour of their  |central_Arabian|Sultanate_Of_Nejd|  ally  |Ibn_Saud|Ibn_Saud| , who proceeded to  |conquer_Husseins_kingdom|Saudi_Conquest_Of_Hejaz| .       The declaration was first endorsed by a foreign government on 27 December 1917, when  |Serbian|Kingdom_Of_Serbia|  Zionist leader and diplomat  |David_Albala|David_Albala|  announced the support of Serbias  |government_in_exile|Government_In_Exile|  during a  |mission|Diplomatic_Mission|  to the United States.   The French and Italian governments offered their endorsements, on 14 February and 9 May 1918, respectively. At a  |private_meeting_in_London_on_1_December_1918|1918_Clemenceau–Lloyd_George_Agreement| , Lloyd George and French Prime Minister  |Georges_Clemenceau|Georges_Clemenceau|  agreed to certain modifications to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, including British control of Palestine.     On 25 April 1920, the  |San_Remo_conference|San_Remo_Conference|  – an outgrowth of the Paris Peace Conference attended by the prime ministers of Britain, France and Italy, the  |Japanese_Ambassador_to_France|:Category:Ambassadors_Of_Japan_To_France| , and the  |United_States_Ambassador_to_Italy|United_States_Ambassador_To_Italy|  – established the basic terms for three League of Nations mandates: a French mandate for Syria, and British mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine.
