            Curium is a  |transuranic|Transuranic_Element| |_radioactive|Radioactive_Decay| |_chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Cm and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  96. This element of the  |actinide|Actinide|  series was named after  |Marie|Marie_Skłodowska_Curie|  and  |Pierre_Curie|Pierre_Curie|  – both were known for their research on  |radioactivity|Radioactivity| . Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of  |Glenn_T_Seaborg|Glenn_T_Seaborg|  at the  |University_of_California_Berkeley|University_Of_California_Berkeley| . The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1947. Most curium is produced by bombarding  |uranium|Uranium|  or  |plutonium|Plutonium|  with  |neutrons|Neutron|  in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor|  – one  |tonne|Tonne|  of spent  |nuclear_fuel|Nuclear_Fuel|  contains about 20  grams of curium.     Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a relatively high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism|  at  |ambient_conditions|Standard_Conditions_For_Temperature_And_Pressure| , it becomes  |antiferromagnetic|Antiferromagnetism|  upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits  |valence|Valence|  +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly  |fluorescent|Fluorescence|  complexes with various organic compounds, but there is no evidence of its incorporation into  |bacteria|Bacteria|  and  |archaea|Archaea| . When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes  |cancer|Cancer| .     All known  |isotopes|Isotope|  of curium are radioactive and have a small  |critical_mass|Critical_Mass|  for a sustained  |nuclear_chain_reaction|Nuclear_Chain_Reaction| . They predominantly emit  |α_particles|Alpha_Radiation| , and the heat released in this process can serve as a heat source in  |radioisotope_thermoelectric_generators|Radioisotope_Thermoelectric_Generator| , but this application is hindered by the scarcity and high cost of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238 Pu  |radionuclide|Radionuclide|  for power sources in  |artificial_pacemakers|Artificial_Pacemaker| . It served as the  |α_source|Alpha_Radiation|  in the  |alpha_particle_X_ray_spectrometers|Alpha_Particle_X_Ray_Spectrometer|  installed on several space probes, including the  |Sojourner|Mars_Pathfinder| ,  |Spirit|Spirit_Rover| ,  |Opportunity|Opportunity_Rover|  and  |Curiosity|Curiosity_Rover| |_Mars|Mars|  rovers and the  |Philae_lander|Philae_Lander|  on  |comet|Comet| |_67P_Churyumov–Gerasimenko|67P_Churyumov–Gerasimenko| , to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.             Although curium had likely been produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was  |first_intentionally_synthesized|Discoveries_Of_The_Chemical_Elements| , isolated and identified in 1944, at the  |University_of_California_Berkeley|University_Of_California_Berkeley| , by  |Glenn_T_Seaborg|Glenn_T_Seaborg| ,  |Ralph_A_James|Ralph_A_James| , and  |Albert_Ghiorso|Albert_Ghiorso| . In their experiments, they used a   |cyclotron|Cyclotron| .      Curium was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory  at the  |University_of_Chicago|University_Of_Chicago| . It was the third  |transuranium_element|Transuranium_Element|  to be discovered even though it is the fourth in the series – the lighter element  |americium|Americium|  was unknown at the time.      The sample was prepared as follows: first  |plutonium|Plutonium|  nitrate solution was coated on a  |platinum|Platinum|  foil of about 0.5  cm 2 area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into  |plutonium_oxide|Plutonium_Oxide|  by  |annealing|Annealing| . Following cyclotron irradiation of the oxide, the coating was dissolved with  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous  |ammonia_solution|Ammonium_Hydroxide| . The residue was dissolved in  |perchloric_acid|Perchloric_Acid| , and further separation was carried out by  |ion_exchange|Ion_Exchange|  to yield a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that the Berkeley group initially called those elements  pandemonium   and  delirium  . Krebs, Robert E. , Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006,  p. 322       The curium-242 isotope was produced in July–August 1944 by bombarding 239 Pu with  |α_particles|Alpha_Radiation|  to produce curium with the release of a  |neutron|Neutron| .
