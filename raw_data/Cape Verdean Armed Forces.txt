Before 1975, Cape Verde was an overseas province of  |Portugal|Portugal| , having a small Portuguese military garrison that included both Cape Verdean and European Portuguese soldiers.     At the same time, some Cape Verdeans were serving in the Peoples Revolutionary Armed Forces , the military wing of the  |African_Party_for_the_Independence_of_Guinea_and_Cape_Verde|African_Party_For_The_Independence_Of_Guinea_And_Cape_Verde|  that was fighting for the joint independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in the  |Guinea-Bissau_War_of_Independence|Guinea-Bissau_War_Of_Independence| . The FARP became the national armed forces of  |Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau|  when its independence was recognized by Portugal in 1974.     The Armed Forces of Cape Verde were created when the country became independent in 1975, being also officially designated the Peoples Revolutionary Armed Forces . The Cape Verdean FARP consisted of two independent branches, the Army  and the Coast Guard .     In the early 1990s, the designation FARP was dropped and the military of Cape Verde started to be designated the Cape Verdean Armed Forces .     In 2007, the FACV started a major reorganization that included the transformation of the Army into the National Guard .     Together with the Cape Verdean Police, the FACV carried out Operation Flying Launch , a successful operation to put an end to a  |drug_trafficking|Drug_Trafficking|  group which smuggled  |cocaine|Cocaine|  from  |Colombia|Colombia|  to the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  and  |Germany|Germany|  using Cape Verde as a reorder point. The operation took more than three years, being a secret operation during the first two years, and ended in 2010.     Although located in Africa, Cape Verde had always close relations with Europe. Because of this, several opinions defend that Cape Verde may enter the  |Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe|Organization_For_Security_And_Co-Operation_In_Europe|  and  |NATO|Nato| .
