There are distortions of the rhombicuboctahedron that, while some of the faces are not regular polygons, are still vertex-uniform. Some of these can be made by taking a cube or octahedron and cutting off the edges, then trimming the corners, so the resulting polyhedron has six square and twelve rectangular faces. These have octahedral symmetry and form a continuous series between the cube and the octahedron, analogous to the distortions of the rhombicosidodecahedron or the tetrahedral distortions of the cuboctahedron . However, the rhombicuboctahedron also has a second set of distortions with six rectangular and sixteen trapezoidal faces, which do not have octahedral symmetry but rather T h symmetry, so they are invariant under the same rotations as the tetrahedron but different reflections.     The lines along which a Rubiks Cube can be turned are, projected onto a sphere, similar, topologically identical, to a rhombicuboctahedrons edges. In fact, variants using the Rubiks Cube mechanism have been produced which closely resemble the rhombicuboctahedron.     The rhombicuboctahedron is used in three uniform space-filling tessellations : the cantellated cubic honeycomb , the runcitruncated cubic honeycomb , and the runcinated alternated cubic honeycomb .       The rhombicuboctahedron can be dissected into two square cupola e and a central octagonal prism . A rotation of one cupola by 45 degrees creates the pseudo & shy;rhombi & shy;cubocta & shy;hedron. Both of these polyhedra have the same vertex figure: 3.4.4.4.     There are three pairs of parallel planes that each intersect the rhombicuboctahedron in a regular octagon. The rhombicuboctahedron may be divided along any of these to obtain an octagonal prism with regular faces and two additional polyhedra called square cupolae , which count among the Johnson solid s; it is thus an elongated square ortho": null

        ". These pieces can be reassembled to give a new solid called the elongated square gyrobicupola or pseudorhombicuboctahedron, with the symmetry of a square antiprism. In this the vertices are all locally the same as those of a rhombicuboctahedron, with one triangle and three squares meeting at each one, but are not all identical with respect to the entire polyhedron, since some are closer to the symmetry axis than others.           The rhombicuboctahedron has six special orthogonal projection s, centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and three types of faces: triangles, and two squares. The last two correspond to the B 2 and A 2 Coxeter plane s.         The rhombicuboctahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling , and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection . This projection is conformal , preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.         A half symmetry form of the rhombicuboctahedron, , exists with pyritohedral symmetry , as Coxeter diagram , Schläfli symbol s 2 , and can be called a cantic snub octahedron. This form can be visualized by alternatingly coloring the edges of the 6 square s. These squares can then be distorted into rectangle s, while the 8 triangles remain equilateral. The 12 diagonal square faces will become isosceles trapezoid s. In the limit, the rectangles can be reduced to edges, and the trapezoids become triangles, and an icosahedron is formed, by a snub octahedron construction, , s.             Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a rhombicuboctahedron centred at the origin, with edge length 2 units, are all the even permutation s of   :.     If the original rhombicuboctahedron has unit edge length, its dual strombic icositetrahedron has edge lengths   :                 The area A and the volume V of the rhombicuboctahedron of edge length a are:   :     A &   & &   21.464      V &   a3 & &   8.714              The optimal packing fraction of rhombicuboctahedra is given by   :       .   It was noticed that this optimal value is obtained in a Bravais lattice by . Since the rhombicuboctahedron is contained in a rhombic dodecahedron whose inscribed sphere is identical to its own inscribed sphere, the value of the optimal packing fraction is a corollary of the Kepler conjecture : it can be achieved by putting a rhombicuboctahedron in each cell of the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb , and it cannot be surpassed, since otherwise the optimal packing density of spheres could be surpassed by putting a sphere in each rhombicuboctahedron of the hypothetical packing which surpasses it.
