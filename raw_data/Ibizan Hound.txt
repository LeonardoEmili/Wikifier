            The Ibizan Hound  is a lean, agile  |dog|Dog|  of the  |hound|Hound|  family. There are two hair types of the  |breed|Dog_Breed|           The Ibizan Hound is an elegant and agile breed, with an athletic and attractive outline and a ground-covering springy trot. Though graceful in appearance, it has good bone girth and is a rugged/hardy breed. Its large upright ears - a hallmark of the breed - are broad at the base and frame a long and elegant headpiece. The neck is long and lean. It has a unique front assembly with well laid-back shoulders and relatively straight upper arm. Coming in both smooth and wire-coated varieties, their coat is a combination of red and white with the nose, ears, eye rims, and pads of feet being a light tan color. Its eyes are a striking  |amber|Amber|  color and have an alert and intelligent expression. The Ibizan may range in height, depending on which Standard you follow, from  and weigh from , males being larger than females.       Ibizan Hounds are intelligent, active, and engaging by nature. They rank 53rd in  |Stanley_Corens|Stanley_Coren| |_The_Intelligence_of_Dogs|The_Intelligence_Of_Dogs| , being of average working/obedience intelligence, but many Ibizan owners will enjoy recounting a multitude of examples of their problem-solving abilities. They are true clowns of the dog world, delighting in entertaining their people with their antics. Though somewhat independent and stubborn at times, they do take well to training if positive methods are used, but will balk at punitive training methods. They are generally quiet, but will alarm bark if necessary, so they make good watch dogs. They are sensitive hounds, and very good around children and other dogs alike. They generally make good house dogs, but are active and athletic, therefore need a lot of daily exercise. They do not make good kennel dogs. Ibizan hounds are sweet, but they are very stubborn and independent.     Ibizan Hounds are escapologists : they are able to jump incredible heights from a standstill, so they need very tall fences. They also have been known to climb, and many can escape from crates, open baby gates and even locks. They have a strong  |prey_drive|Prey_Drive| , therefore they cannot be trusted off leash unless in a safely enclosed area. Once off the leash, they might not come back for a long time. A hound that knows where its home is and the surrounding area will usually return unscathed.       The Ibizan Hound is typical of the  |Hound_Group|Hound_Group|  in that it rarely suffers from  |hereditary|Hereditary|  illness. Minor health concerns for the breed include  |seizures|Seizure|  and  |allergies|Allergy| ; very rarely, one will see  |axonal_dystrophy|Axonal_Dystrophy| ,  |cataract|Cataract| ,  |retinal_dysplasia|Retinal_Dysplasia|  and  |deafness|Deafness|  in the breed. Ibizan Hound owners should have their dogs eyes tested by a  |veterinarian|Veterinarian|  before breeding. CERF and  |BAER|Baer|  testing is recommended for the breed. Ibizan Hounds are sensitive to  |barbiturate|Barbiturate| |_anesthesia|Anesthesia| , and typically live between 12 and 14 years. Coile, Caroline, Ph.D., Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds, Barrons Educational Series, 2005. Page 80.          This breed originates in the island of  |Eivissa|Eivissa|  and has been traditionally used in the  |Catalan|Catalan_Language| -speaking areas of Spain, and  |France|France|  where it was known under the name of le charnigue, to hunt  |rabbits|Rabbit|  and other small game. The Ibizan Hound is a fast dog that can hunt on all types of terrain, working by scent, sound and sight. Hunters run these dogs in mostly female packs, with perhaps a male or two, as the female is considered the better hunter.     Traditionally a farmer may have one dog and a very well off farmer two dogs to catch rabbits for food. However in the last twenty years it is seen as a sport where between five and fifteen dogs can be seen in the chase of one rabbit.     The Ibizan Hound authority Miquel Rosselló has provided a detailed description of a working trial which characterises their typical hunting technique and action, Cà Eivessenc: l’Alternativa/Podenco Ibicenco: La Alternativa. Palma de Mallorca: Caixa de Balears Sa Nostra 1987 strikingly illustrated with action photos by  |Charles_Camberoque|Charles_Camberoque|   which demonstrate hunt behaviour and typical hunt terrain.   While local hunters will at times use one dog or a  |brace|Brace| , and frequently packs of six to eight or as many as fifteen, the working trial requires an evaluation of one or two braces. A brace is called a colla. The couples should be tested on at least two to five rabbits , without the use of any other hunting aid. An inspection and evaluation of the exterior, fitness, character and obedience of the dogs is recommended prior to the hunt.   The trial is qualified as having 5 parts. The dogs should show: careful tracking and scenting of the rabbit, without being distracted in the least, 0-30 points; correct signalling of the game, patient stand, strong jump into the air, obedience 0-10 points; chase, giving tongue, speed, sureness, anticipation 0-30 points; putting the game to cover at close quarters, listening, waiting, obedience, correct attack 0-10 point; and good catch, or correct indication of the game’s location, retrieval, obedience 0-20 points.     Individual dogs are expected to show a great degree of discipline, obedience and co-operation. They should be extremely agile, have good speed and a powerful vertical jump from a stationary position in rough and often heavily covered ground. They should have excellent scent-tracking abilities, give tongue at the right time when approaching the game closely, and otherwise be silent so that they can locate the game by sound.     The Ibizan Hound is similar in function and type to several breeds, such as the  |Pharaoh_Hound|Pharaoh_Hound| , the  |Cirneco_dellEtna|Cirneco_Delletna| , the  |Portuguese_Podengo|Portuguese_Podengo| , and the  |Podenco_Canario|Podenco_Canario| . The Ibizan Hound is the largest of these breeds, classified by the  |Fédération_Cynologique_Internationale|Fédération_Cynologique_Internationale|  as primitive types.     It is believed the Ibizan Hound evolves from the tesem, the  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ian hunting dog. Representations of this dog on the walls of ancient tombs show a striking similarity to the modern Ibizan Hound. These dogs would have been brought to the island of Eivissa by the  |Phoenicians|Phoenicians| , who founded settlements there as early as the 8th century BC.  A recent  |DNA_analysis|Dna_Analysis|  found that the breed was formed recently from other breeds.    A more recent article    argues that continued trait selective breeding may be behind this lack of support.     In the United States, the Ibizan Hound is frequently competed in lure coursing through the AKC and ASFA, and also competes in LGRA straight racing and NOTRA oval track racing. Some parts of the country also use them for coursing live prey, generally jackrabbits.     The Ibizan Hound breed is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, Continental Kennel Club,  |American_Kennel_Club|American_Kennel_Club| ,  |United_Kennel_Club|United_Kennel_Club| , Kennel Club of Great Britain,  |Canadian_Kennel_Club|Canadian_Kennel_Club| , National Kennel Club,  |New_Zealand_Kennel_Club|New_Zealand_Kennel_Club| ,  |Australian_National_Kennel_Council|Australian_National_Kennel_Council| , Americas Pet Registry, and American Canine Registry. It was fully recognized by the  |American_Kennel_Club|American_Kennel_Club|  in 1979.       According to journalist Norman Lewis, when an owner no longer wants to own one of these dogs , it is considered very bad luck to kill the dog. Instead, they release the dog on the other side of the island, so that someone else might adopt the animal.
