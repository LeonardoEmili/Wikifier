        In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , the Heracleidae  or Heraclids  were the numerous descendants of  |Heracles|Heracles|  , especially applied in a narrower sense to the descendants of  |Hyllus|Hyllus| , the eldest of his four sons by  |Deianira|Deianira|  . Other Heracleidae included  |Macaria|Macaria| , Lamos,  |Manto|Manto| ,  |Bianor|Bienor| ,  |Tlepolemus|Tlepolemus| , and  |Telephus|Telephus| . These Heraclids were a group of  |Dorian|Dorians|  kings who conquered the  |Peloponnesian|Peloponnesus|  kingdoms of  |Mycenae|Mycenae| ,  |Sparta|Sparta|  and  |Argos|Argos| ; according to the literary tradition in  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , they claimed a right to rule through their ancestor. Since  |Karl_Otfried_Müllers|Karl_Otfried_Müller|  Die Dorier , I. ch. 3, their rise to dominance has been associated with a  |Dorian_invasion|Dorian_Invasion|  .     Though details of genealogy differ from one ancient author to another, the cultural significance of the mythic theme, that the descendants of Heracles, exiled after his death, returned some generations later to reclaim land that their ancestors had held in  |Mycenaean_Greece|Mycenaean_Greece| , was to assert the primal legitimacy of a traditional ruling clan that traced its origin, thus its legitimacy, to Heracles.       Heracles, whom  |Zeus|Zeus|  had originally intended to be ruler of  |Argos|Argos| ,  |Lacedaemon|Lacedaemon|  and Messenian  |Pylos|Pylos| , had been supplanted by the cunning of  |Hera|Hera| , and his intended possessions had fallen into the hands of  |Eurystheus|Eurystheus| , king of  |Mycenae|Mycenae| . After the death of  |Heracles|Heracles| , his children, after many wanderings, found refuge from Eurystheus at  |Athens|Athens_Greece| . Eurystheus, on his demand for their surrender being refused, attacked Athens, but was defeated and slain. Hyllus and his brothers then invaded Peloponnesus, but after a years stay were forced by a pestilence to quit. They withdrew to  |Thessaly|Thessaly| , where  |Aegimius|Aegimius| , the mythical ancestor of the  |Dorians|Dorians| , whom Heracles had assisted in war against the  |Lapithae|Lapiths| , adopted Hyllus and made over to him a third part of his territory.     After the death of  |Aegimius|Aegimius| , his two sons,  |Pamphylus|Pamphylus|  and  |Dymas|Dymas| , voluntarily submitted to Hyllus , who thus became ruler of the Dorians, the three branches of that race being named after these three heroes. Desiring to reconquer his paternal inheritance, Hyllus consulted the  |Delphic_oracle|Delphi| , which told him to wait for the third fruit , and then enter Peloponnesus by a narrow passage by sea . Accordingly, after three years,  |Hyllus|Hyllus|  marched across the  |isthmus|Isthmus|  of  |Corinth|Corinth_Greece|  to attack  |Atreus|Atreus| , the successor of  |Eurystheus|Eurystheus| , but was slain in single combat by  |Echemus|Echemus| , king of  |Tegea|Tegea| . This second attempt was followed by a third under  |Cleodaeus|Cleodaeus|  and a fourth under  |Aristomachus|Aristomachus| , both unsuccessful.          At last,  |Temenus|Temenus| ,  |Cresphontes|Cresphontes|  and  |Aristodemus|Aristodemus| , the sons of Aristomachus, complained to the oracle that its instructions had proved fatal to those who had followed them. They received the answer that by the third fruit the third generation was meant, and that the narrow passage was not the isthmus of Corinth, but the straits of  |Rhium|Rhium| . They accordingly built a fleet at  |Naupactus|Naupactus| , but before they set sail,  |Aristodemus|Aristodemus|  was struck by lightning  and the fleet destroyed, because one of the Heracleidae had slain an  |Acarnanian|Acarnanian|  soothsayer.     The oracle, being again consulted by  |Temenus|Temenus| , bade him offer an expiatory sacrifice and banish the murderer for ten years, and look out for a man with three eyes to act as guide. On his way back to  |Naupactus|Naupactus| ,  |Temenus|Temenus|  fell in with  |Oxylus|Oxylus| , an Aetolian, who had lost one eye, riding on a horse and immediately pressed him into his service. According to another account, a mule on which Oxylus rode had lost an eye. The Heracleidae repaired their ships, sailed from  |Naupactus|Naupactus|  to  |Antirrhium|Antirrhium| , and thence to  |Rhium|Rhium|  in  |Peloponnesus|Peloponnesus| . A decisive battle was fought with  |Tisamenus|Tisamenus| , son of  |Orestes|Orestes| , the chief ruler in the peninsula, who was defeated and slain. This conquest was traditionally dated eighty years after the  |Trojan_War|Trojan_War| . http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?docThuc.+1.12 Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 1.12     The Heracleidae, who thus became practically masters of Peloponnesus, proceeded to distribute its territory among themselves by lot.  |Argos|Argos|  fell to  |Temenus|Temenus| ,  |Lacedaemon|Lacedaemon|  to  |Procles|Procles|  and  |Eurysthenes|Eurysthenes| , the twin sons of  |Aristodemus|Aristodemus| ; and  |Messenia|Messenia|  to  |Cresphontes|Cresphontes|   The fertile district of  |Elis|Elis|  had been reserved by agreement for  |Oxylus|Oxylus| . The Heracleidae ruled in  |Lacedaemon|Lacedaemon|  until 221 BCE, but disappeared much earlier in the other countries.     This conquest of  |Peloponnesus|Peloponnesus|  by the Dorians, commonly called the Dorian invasion or the Return of the Heraclidae , is represented as the recovery by the descendants of Heracles of the rightful inheritance of their hero ancestor and his sons. The Dorians followed the custom of other Greek tribes in claiming as ancestor for their ruling families one of the legendary heroes, but the traditions must not on that account be regarded as entirely mythical. They represent a joint invasion of Peloponnesus by Aetolians and Dorians, the latter having been driven southward from their original northern home under pressure from the Thessalians. It is noticeable that there is no mention of these Heraclidae or their invasion in  |Homer|Homer|  or  |Hesiod|Hesiod| .  |Herodotus|Herodotus|  speaks of poets who had celebrated their deeds, but these were limited to events immediately succeeding the death of Heracles.              At  |Sparta|Sparta| , the Heraclids formed two dynasties ruling jointly: the  |Agiads|Agiads|  and the  |Eurypontids|Eurypontids| .       At Corinth the Heraclids ruled as the  |Bacchiadae|Bacchiadae|  dynasty Diodorus Siculus, 7.9 before the aristocratic revolution, which brought a Bacchiad aristocracy into power. The kings were as follows:   Aletes 1073 - 1035 BCE   Ixion 1035 - 997 BCE   Agelas I 997 - 960 BCE   Prymnis 960 - 925 BCE   Bacchis 925 - 890 BCE   Agelas II 890 - 860 BCE   Eudemus 860 - 835 BCE   Aristomedes 835 - 800 BCE   Agemon 800 - 784 BCE   Alexander 784 - 759 BCE   Telestes 759 - 747 BCE          The Greek tragedians amplified the story, probably drawing inspiration from local legends which glorified the services rendered by Athens to the rulers of Peloponnesus.     The Heracleidae feature as the main subjects of  |Euripides|Euripides|  play, Heracleidae. It is the first of two surviving plays by Euripides where the family of Heracles are suppliants . J. A. Spranger found the political subtext of Heracleidae, never far to seek, so particularly apt in Athens towards the end of the peace of Nicias, in 419 BCE, that he suggested the date as that of the plays first performance.   J. A. Spranger, The Political Element in the Heracleidae of Euripides The Classical Quarterly 19.3/4 , pp. 117-128.       In the tragedy,  |Iolaus|Iolaus| , Heracles old comrade, and Heracles children, Macaria and her brothers and sisters have hidden from  |Eurystheus|Eurystheus|  in  |Athens|Athens| , ruled by King  |_Demophon|Demophon_Of_Athens| ; as the first scene makes clear, they expect that the blood relationship of the kings with Heracles and their fathers past indebtedness to  |Theseus|Theseus|  will finally provide them sanctuary. As Eurystheus prepares to attack, an  |oracle|Oracle|  tells Demophon that only the sacrifice of a noble woman to  |Persephone|Persephone|  can guarantee an Athenian victory. Macaria volunteers for the sacrifice and a spring is named the  |Macarian_spring|Macarian_Spring| .
