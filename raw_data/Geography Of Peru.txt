|Peru|Peru|  is a country on the central western coast of  |South_America|South_America|  facing the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| . It lies wholly in the  |Southern_Hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere| , its northernmost extreme reaching to 1.8 minutes of latitude or about  south of the  |equator|Equator| . Peru shares land borders with  |Ecuador|Ecuador| ,  |Colombia|Colombia| ,  |Brazil|Brazil| ,  |Bolivia|Bolivia| , and  |Chile|Chile| , with its longest land border shared with Brazil.            Area:   Peru has a total land area of 1,279,999  km² and a total water area of 5,000  km².     Maritime claims:   Continental shelf:      Territorial sea:       Exclusive economic zone :        Land use:   Only 3% of Perus land is arable, with 0.5% being suitable for permanent crops. Permanent pastureland accounts for 21% of Perus land use, and forests and woodland accounting for 66% of the landscape. Approximately 9.5% of Peruvian land is attributed to population centers, coastal regions, and other space.     Irrigated land:   12,800  km²     Natural hazards: Natural hazards that Peru experiences include earthquakes,  |tsunamis|Tsunami| , flooding, landslides, and mild volcanic activity. The geographic positioning of Peru adjacent to the adjoining Nazca and South American tectonic plates - converging in the Atacama trench off the Pacific coast - serves as the catalyst to many of Perus natural hazards.     Environment - current issues:   deforestation ; overgrazing of the slopes of the coast and sierra leading to soil erosion; desertification; air pollution in Lima; pollution of rivers and coastal waters from municipal and mining wastes     Environment - international agreements:   party to:    |Antarctic_Treaty|Antarctic_Treaty| ,  |Antarctic-Environmental_Protocol|Antarctic-Environmental_Protocol| ,  |Biodiversity|Biodiversity| ,  |Climate_Change|United_Nations_Framework_Convention_On_Climate_Change| ,  |Desertification|Desertification| ,  |Endangered_Species|Endangered_Species| ,  |Hazardous_Wastes|Hazardous_Wastes| ,  |Nuclear_Test_Ban|Nuclear_Test_Ban| ,  |Ozone_Layer_Protection|Ozone_Layer_Protection| ,  |Ship_Pollution|Ship_Pollution| ,  |Tropical_Timber_83|Tropical_Timber_83| ,  |Tropical_Timber_94|Tropical_Timber_94| ,  |Wetlands|Wetlands| ,  |Whaling|Whaling| 	   signed, but not ratified:   Climate Change- |Kyoto_Protocol|Kyoto_Protocol|      Peru shares control of  |Lake_Titicaca|Lake_Titicaca| , worlds highest navigable lake, with Bolivia.       The most populated city in the country is  |Lima|Lima| , the capital of Peru. Limas metropolitan area has a population over 10 million. The second largest city in Peru,  |Arequipa|Arequipa| , has a population of 989,919, and  |Trujillo|Trujillo,_Peru|  is a growing city in the northern area of the country holds a population of 935,147. Perus developed urban cities are found in coastal regions and to the north. There are 32.1 million people who live in Peru.  The percentage of urbanization in Peru is 79.2%, and holds a yearly increase of 1.57%.  Lima forms part of the  |largest_cities_in_the_Americas|Largest_Cities_In_The_Americas| , and holds 31.7% of the countrys population.  The dense concentration of the population size of Peru is 25 people/km² or 57/mi².  Lima is a pull factor that draws millions of Peruvians from the suburbs to the capital. This urban inland migration is the result of sprawling around Lima. These sprawling places are known as “Pueblos Jóvenes”. The young towns and Lima make up the metropolitan area that extend .      The urban growth brings issues to the metropolitan area and the environment. Lima is the most polluted city in Latin America.  The overcrowding and growth of urbanization has caused Peruvians to use its green spaces for garbage disposal. This leads to the pollution of the river Rimac that supplies water to the metropolitan area.     The rise of urbanization forgets the historic sites, ruins or “ |huacas|Huaca| ”, which are being replaced for buildings, roads, etc. Lima is home of 400 sites of 46,000 in the country, the country itself only preserves 1%.      Thousands of  |Venezuelans|Venezuelans|  head to Peru in search of residency.  The  |International_migration|International_Migration|  is caused by social, environmental, and economic crises. This push factor migration has brought to Peru sustenance problems like instability and food shortage.              The combination of tropical latitude, mountain ranges, topography variations and two ocean currents gives Peru a large diversity of climates. Peru has a tropical climate with a wet and dry season.       The eastern portions of Peru include the  |Amazon_Basin|Amazon_Basin|  or selva baja, a region that is larger in the north than in the south. Representing roughly 60% of Perus national territory, this area includes the  |Amazon|Amazon_River| ,  |Marañón|Marañón_River| ,  |Huallaga|Huallaga_River|  and  |Ucayali|Ucayali|  Rivers.      Almost 60% of the countrys area is located within this region,   giving Peru the fourth largest area of tropical forest in the world after Brazil,  |Congo|Democratic_Republic_Of_Congo|  and  |Indonesia|Indonesia| .        The Andes shelter the very largest variety of climates in the country. The climate is semi-arid in the valleys and moist in higher elevations and towards the eastern flanks. Rainfall varies from  per year. The monsoonal period starts in October and ends in April. The rainiest months are January through March where travel can be sometimes affected.     The western slopes are arid to semi-arid and receive rainfall only between January and March. Below the  mark, the temperatures vary between  in the night versus  in the day.     Between , the temperatures vary from  in the night and from  during the day. At higher elevations from , the  |Puna|Puna_Grassland|  ecoregion, the temperature varies from  during the night versus  during the day.     The northernmost regions of the Andes around  |Cajamarca|Cajamarca|  and  |Piura|Piura|  regions have  |Páramo|Páramo|  climates.       The Peruvian coast is a microclimatic region. The region is affected by the cold  |Humboldt_Current|Humboldt_Current| , the  |El_Niño_Southern_Oscillation|El_Niño_Southern_Oscillation| ,  |tropical|Tropical| |latitude|Latitude| , and the  |Andes|Andes|  mountain range.     The central and southern coast consists mainly of a subtropical desert climate composed of sandy or rocky shores and inland cutting valleys. Days alternate between overcast skies with occasional fog in the winter and sunny skies with occasional haze in the summer, with the only precipitation being an occasional light-to-moderate  |drizzle|Drizzle|  that is known locally as  garúa . These regions are usually characterized by mildly cold lows  and also mild highs . Temperatures rarely fall below  and do not go over . An exception is the southern coast, where it does get a bit warmer and drier for most of the year during daytime, and where it can also get much colder during winter nights .     The northern coast, on the contrary, has a curious tropical-dry climate, generally referred to as  |tropical_savanna|Tropical_And_Subtropical_Grasslands,_Savannas,_And_Shrublands| . This region is a lot warmer and can be unbearable during summer months, where rainfall is also present. The region differs from the southern coast by the presence of shrubs, equatorial dry forests ,  |mangrove|Mangrove|  forests, tropical valleys near rivers such as the  |Chira|Chira_River|  and the  |Tumbes|Rio_Tumbes| . The average temperature is .       The central and southern coast have a  |subtropical|Subtropical|  desert climate, despite this region being located in the tropics. The  |Humboldt_Current|Humboldt_Current| , serving as one cause of climactic differentiation, is  colder than normal tropical seas at , thus preventing high tropical temperatures from appearing. Additionally, due to the height of the Andes cordillera, there is no passage of hot clouds from the Amazon to the coast, the climate is cooler than that of similar tropical latitudes. This can create a great deal of humidity and fog during winter months.     Moreover, the Andes mountains are very close to the coast, a geographic factor that prevents  |cumulus|Cumulus|  or  |cumulonimbus|Cumulonimbus|  clouds from appearing. Therefore, a shade effect is created, causing very low annual rainfall in this region.      Rainfall averages  per year near the Chilean border to  per year on the northern coast and nearer the Andes.     The central coast is composed of regions including  |La_Libertad|La_Libertad_Region| ,  |Ancash|Ancash|  and  |Lima|Lima| , which have a spring-like climate for most of the year. Foggy and sunny days intermingle around the humid sand dunes during most of the year.     Most summers have pleasant temperatures ranging from  during the night to about  during the daytime. Winters are very humid, and range from  during the nights to around the  during the day. The spring and autumn months have a pleasant climate that ranges from  during the day to around  during the night. Moving inland into the Yunga valleys, the climate tends to be ~ drier and warmer during any given month.     The southern coast, composed of the  |Ica|Ica_Region| ,  |Arequipa|Arequipa| ,  |Moquegua|Moquegua|  and  |Tacna|Tacna|  regions, has a drier and warmer climate during the day for all seasons, although colder in winter. There are regions famous for their sand dunes and impressive deserts that are, in part, caused by the drier and hotter climate. Temperatures in this region can reach up to  in the  |Nazca|Nazca|  region while inland regions can fall to  during the winter months. During the day, temperatures rarely go below the  for all months of the year. This purports the idea that the southern coast has a more desert-like climate, although daily temperature variations exist as they do in other regions within tropical latitudes. Clear skies are often present in desert areas and, although less common, near the coastal cliffs as well, which are home to a variety of fish and marine mammals.       The northern coast consists of the eastern region of  |Lambayeque|Lambayeque_Region| , the  |Piura_Region|Piura_Region|  and the  |Tumbes_Region|Tumbes_Region| .   They are characterized by having different climate and geography from the rest of the coast. Right between the 3-hour drive on the  |Sechura_desert|Sechura_Desert| , which is located north of the  |Lambayeque_Region|Lambayeque_Region|  and south of the  |Piura_Region|Piura_Region| , is the evidence of climate change from the common subtropical desert found on the south to visible tropicalization effects of the tropical dry climate or  |tropical_savanna|Tropical_Savanna| . Examples of this are the tropical dry forests that begin to appear. They are composed of shrubs, thorny trees, carob trees, faique trees, huayacan trees, hualtaco trees, palo santo trees, ceibo trees and on the coast   mangrove forests. It is also a biodiverse area where typical wildlife can be observed such as crocodiles, reptiles, iguanas, boas, pava aliblanca, anteater, bear, sloth and many more.     This climatic change is caused by the presence of the warm El Niño Current during the summer months , the eventual  |El_Niño|El_Niño|  Phenomenon and the passing of Amazon Jungles clouds due to mountain openings and lower altitudes of the Andes Chain. These are the causes for a climate change in a short two- or three-hour trajectory that is visible between the  |Lambayeque_Region|Lambayeque_Region|  and the  |Sechura_Province|Sechura_Province| , where not only geography changes but a temperature rise of  or more depending on the month. It is directly off the shores of the  |Sechura_Region|Sechura_Province|  where the cold Humboldt current and warm El Niño current meet, at about 5° to 6° south of the equator. From this point, warm temperatures are most common, and there are no true winters. Average temperatures range between .     Summer is more humid and very hot, with average temperatures that vary from  during the night to around  during the day, although north of Lambayeque it can reach the . Winters are cooler during the nights; around  during the night, to around  during the daytime.     There are protected areas in  |Tumbes|Tumbes,_Peru|  and  |Piura|Piura|  filled with tropical  |canelo|Drimys_Winteri|  forests and tropical dry forests such as Caza de Coto and Cerros de Amotape, both extending into southern Ecuador. The areas of eastern  |Lambayeque|Lambayeque_Region|  also have tropical dry forests, which are found in the Chaparri and Chongoyape provinces. These forests have the particularity of connecting to the  |Amazon_basin|Amazon_Basin|  through the  |Marañon|Marañón_River|  passage . Mangrove forests are located in four specific areas from  |Sechura|Sechura|  to Tumbes.     In these regions, the mangrove forests are at the ending strips of the Piura River in the  |Sechura_Province|Sechura_Province|  . To the north, the ending strips of the  |Chira_River|Chira_River| ,  |Tumbes_River|Tumbes_River| , and  |Zarumilla_River|Zarumilla_River|  also have mangrove forests that flow into the ocean.

Common crops include, but are not limited to root vegetables like potatoes and cassava; peppers including chilies and paprika; vegetables like asparagus, tomatoes; quinoa; kiwicha; and fruits like mangoes, passion fruit,citrus, and bananas.  Levels of undernourished citizens and children who suffer from undernourishment has dramatically decreased from just under six million to just over two million between 2000 and 2017, while food availability has increased from an energy percentage of 105 to 117 between 2000 and 2017.      As food production in Peru increases, farmers saturate the soil with nutrients with Nitrogen and Phosphorus bases. Oversaturation of nutrients leads to eutrophication in nearby water bodies resulting in dead zones. Carbon emissions due to manufacturing and food processing leads to reduced air quality which contributes to the global warming that increases severity of natural disasters and acidifies the ocean leading to mass bleaching in coral reefs which will destroy oceanic ecosystems.
