Star clusters are very large groups of  |stars|Star| . Two types of star clusters can be distinguished:  |globular_clusters|Globular_Cluster|  are tight groups of hundreds to millions of old stars which are  |gravitation|Gravitation| ally bound, while  |open_clusters|Open_Cluster| , more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally contain fewer than a few hundred members, and are often very young. Open clusters become disrupted over time by the gravitational influence of  |giant_molecular_clouds|Giant_Molecular_Cloud|  as they move through the  |galaxy|Galaxy| , but cluster members will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space even though they are no longer gravitationally bound; they are then known as a  |stellar_association|Stellar_Association| , sometimes also referred to as a moving group.     Star clusters visible to the naked eye include the  |Pleiades|Pleiades|  ,  |Hyades|Hyades| , and the  |Beehive_Cluster|Beehive_Cluster|  .               Globular clusters are roughly spherical groupings of from 10,000 to several million stars packed into regions of from 10 to 30  |light_years|Light_Year|  across. They commonly consist of very old  |Population_II|Stellar_Populations|  stars—just a few hundred million years younger than the universe itself—which are mostly yellow and red, with masses less than two  |solar_mass|Solar_Mass| es.  Such stars predominate within clusters because hotter and more massive stars have exploded as  |supernovae|Supernova| , or evolved through  |planetary_nebula|Planetary_Nebula|  phases to end as  |white_dwarfs|White_Dwarf| . Yet a few rare blue stars exist in globulars, thought to be formed by stellar mergers in their dense inner regions; these stars are known as  |blue_stragglers|Blue_Straggler| .     In our galaxy, globular clusters are distributed roughly spherically in the  |galactic_halo|Galactic_Halo| , around the  |Galactic_Centre|Galactic_Centre| , orbiting the centre in highly elliptical  |orbits|Orbit| . In 1917, the astronomer  |Harlow_Shapley|Harlow_Shapley|  made the first reliable estimate the Suns distance from the galactic centre based on the distribution of globular clusters.     Until the mid-1990s, globular clusters were the cause of a great mystery in astronomy, as theories of  |stellar_evolution|Stellar_Evolution|  gave ages for the oldest members of globular clusters that were greater than the estimated age of the universe. However, greatly improved distance measurements to globular clusters using the  |Hipparcos|Hipparcos|  satellite and increasingly accurate measurements of the  |Hubble_constant|Hubble_Constant|  resolved the paradox, giving an age for the universe of about 13 billion years and an age for the oldest stars of a few hundred million years less.     Our galaxy has about 150 globular clusters, some of which may have been captured from small galaxies disrupted by the Milky Way, as seems to be the case for the  |globular_cluster_M79|Globular_Cluster_M79| . Some galaxies are much richer in globulars: the giant  |elliptical_galaxy|Elliptical_Galaxy| |_M87|Messier_87|  contains over a thousand.     A few of the brightest globular clusters are visible to the  |naked_eye|Naked_Eye| , with the brightest,  |Omega_Centauri|Omega_Centauri| , having been known since antiquity and catalogued as a star before the telescopic age. The brightest globular cluster in the northern hemisphere is  |Messier_13|Messier_13|  in the constellation of  |Hercules|Hercules| .           |Super_star_clusters|Super_Star_Cluster|  are very large regions of recent star formation, and are thought to be the precursors of globular clusters. Examples include  |Westerlund_1|Westerlund_1|  in the Milky Way.              Open clusters are very different from globular clusters. Unlike the spherically distributed globulars, they are confined to the  |galactic_plane|Galactic_Plane| , and are almost always found within  |spiral_arms|Spiral_Arm| . They are generally young objects, up to a few tens of millions of years old, with a few rare exceptions as old as a few billion years, such as  |Messier_67|Messier_67|  for example. Archinal, Brent A., Hynes, Steven J. 2003. Star Clusters, Willmann-Bell, Richmond, VA They form  |H_II_regions|H_Ii_Region|  such as the  |Orion_Nebula|Orion_Nebula| .     Open clusters usually contain up to a few hundred members, within a region up to about 30 light-years across. Being much less densely populated than globular clusters, they are much less tightly gravitationally bound, and over time, are disrupted by the gravity of  |giant_molecular_clouds|Giant_Molecular_Cloud|  and other clusters. Close encounters between cluster members can also result in the ejection of stars, a process known as evaporation.     The most prominent open clusters are the  |Pleiades|Pleiades|  and  |Hyades|Hyades|  in  |Taurus|Taurus| . The  |Double_Cluster|Double_Cluster|  of  |h|Ngc_869| + |Chi_Persei|Ngc_884|  can also be prominent under dark skies. Open clusters are often dominated by hot young blue stars, because although such stars are short-lived in stellar terms, only lasting a few tens of millions of years, open clusters tend to have dispersed before these stars die.     Establishing precise distances to open clusters enables the calibration of the period-luminosity relationship shown by  |Cepheids|Cepheids| |_variable_stars|Variable_Stars| , which are then used as  |standard_candles|Standard_Candle| . Cepheids are luminous and can be used to establish both the distances to remote galaxies and the expansion rate of the Universe . Indeed, the open cluster NGC 7790 hosts three  |classical_Cepheids|Classical_Cepheids|  which are critical for such efforts. Sandage, Allan . , AJ, 128 Majaess, D.; Carraro, G.; Moni Bidin, C.; Bonatto, C.; Berdnikov, L.; Balam, D.; Moyano, M.; Gallo, L.; Turner, D.; Lane, D.; Gieren, W.; Borissova, J.; Kovtyukh, V.; Beletsky, Y. . , A & A, 260                  Embedded clusters are groups of very young stars that are partially or fully encased in an  |Interstellar_dust_or_gas|Cosmic_Dust|  which is often impervious to optical observations. Embedded clusters form in  |molecular_clouds|Molecular_Clouds| , when the clouds begin to collapse and  |form_stars|Star_Formation| . There is often ongoing star formation in these clusters, so embedded clusters may be home to various types of  |young_stellar_objects|Young_Stellar_Object|  including  |protostars|Protostar|  and  |pre_main_sequence_stars|Pre_Main_Sequence_Star| . An example of an embedded cluster is the  |Trapezium_Cluster|Trapezium_Cluster|  in the  |Orion_Nebula|Orion_Nebula| . In  |ρ_Ophiuchi_cloud|Rho_Ophiuchi_Cloud_Complex|  core region there is an embedded cluster.      The embedded cluster phase may last for several million years, after which gas in the cloud is depleted by star formation or dispersed through  |radiation_pressure|Radiation_Pressure| ,  |stellar_winds|Stellar_Wind|  and  |outflows|Astrophysical_Jet| , or  |supernova_explosions|Supernova_Explosion| . In general less than 30% of cloud mass is converted to stars before the cloud is dispersed, but this fraction may be higher in particularly dense parts of the cloud. With the loss of mass in the cloud, the energy of the system is altered, often leading to the disruption of a star cluster. Most young embedded clusters disperse shortly after the end of star formation.      The open clusters found in the Galaxy are former embedded clusters that were able to survive early cluster evolution. However, nearly all freely floating stars, including the  |Sun|Sun| ,  were originally born into embedded clusters that disintegrated.            In 2005, astronomers discovered a new type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters although less dense. No such clusters  are known in the Milky Way. The three discovered in  |Andromeda_Galaxy|Andromeda_Galaxy|  are  |M31WFS_C1|M31Wfs_C1| |_M31WFS_C2|M31Wfs_C2| , and  |M31WFS_C3|M31Wfs_C3| .     These new-found star clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars, a similar number to globular clusters. The clusters also share other characteristics with globular clusters, e.g. the stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are thus much greater. The clusters have properties intermediate between globular clusters and  |dwarf_spheroidal_galaxies|Dwarf_Spheroidal_Galaxy| .      How these clusters are formed is not yet known, but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters. Why M31 has such clusters, while the Milky Way has not, is not yet known. It is also unknown if any other galaxy contains this kind of clusters, but it would be very unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended clusters.     Another type of cluster are faint fuzzies which so far have only been found in  |lenticular_galaxies|Lenticular_Galaxy|  like  |NGC_1023|Ngc_1023|  and  |NGC_3384|Ngc_3384| . They are characterized by their large size compared to globular clusters and a ringlike distribution around the centers of their host galaxies. As the latter they seem to be old objects.             Stellar clusters are important in many areas of astronomy. Because the stars were all born at roughly the same time, the different properties of all the stars in a cluster are a function only of mass, and so stellar evolution theories rely on observations of open and globular clusters.     Clusters are also a crucial step in determining the  |distance_scale_of_the_universe|Distance_Ladder| . A few of the nearest clusters are close enough for their distances to be measured using  |parallax|Parallax| . A  |Hertzsprung–Russell_diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell_Diagram|  can be plotted for these clusters which has absolute values known on the  |luminosity|Luminosity|  axis. Then, when similar diagram is plotted for a cluster whose distance is not known, the position of the  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  can be compared to that of the first cluster and the distance estimated. This process is known as main-sequence fitting.  |Reddening|Extinction|  and  |stellar_populations|Stellar_Population|  must be accounted for when using this method.     Nearly all stars in the Galactic field, including the Sun, were initially born in regions with embedded clusters that disintegrated. This means that properties of stars and planetary systems may have been affected by early clustered environments. This appears to be the case for our own  |Solar_System|Solar_System| , in which chemical abundances point to the effects of a supernova from a nearby star early in our Solar Systems history.       A large group of many stars spread over very many light-years of space; the stars are not part of any structure but are in an area of greater than average stellar density.        In 1979, the  |International_Astronomical_Unions|International_Astronomical_Union|  17th general assembly recommended that newly discovered star clusters, open or globular, within the Galaxy have designations following the convention Chhmm±ddd , always beginning with the prefix C, where h, m, and d represent the approximate coordinates of the cluster center in hours and minutes of  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension| , and degrees of  |declination|Declination| , respectively, with leading zeros. The designation, once assigned, is not to change, even if subsequent measurements improve on the location of the cluster center.  The first of such designations were assigned by  |Gosta_Lynga|Gosta_Lynga|  in 1982.
