Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of  Doctor in the House  . These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered their very own series. However, owing to Chapmans alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was, therefore, unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them. He had found working with Palin on The Frost Report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series.
