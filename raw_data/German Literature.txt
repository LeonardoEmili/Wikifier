German literature of the modern period is mostly in  |Standard_German|Standard_German| , but there are some currents of literature influenced to a greater or lesser degree by  |dialects|German_Dialects|  .     Medieval German literature is  |literature|Literature|  written in Germany, stretching from the  |Carolingian_dynasty|Carolingian_Dynasty| ; various dates have been given for the end of the German literary Middle Ages, the  |Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  being the last possible cut-off point. The Old High German period is reckoned to run until about the mid-11th century; the most famous works are the  Hildebrandslied  and a heroic epic known as the  Heliand .  |Middle_High_German|Middle_High_German|  starts in the 12th century; the key works include  The Ring  and the poems of  |Oswald_von_Wolkenstein|Oswald_Von_Wolkenstein|  and  |Johannes_von_Tepl|Johannes_Von_Tepl| . The Baroque period was one of the most fertile times in German literature.  |Modern_literature|History_Of_Modern_Literature|  in German begins with the authors of  |the_Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment|  . The Sensibility movement of the 1750s–1770s ended with  |Goethes|Goethe|  best-selling  Die Leiden des jungen Werther  . The  |Sturm_und_Drang|Sturm_Und_Drang|  and  |Weimar_Classicism|Weimar_Classicism|  movements were led by  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe|  and  |Friedrich_Schiller|Friedrich_Schiller| .  |German_Romanticism|German_Romanticism|  was the dominant movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.      |Biedermeier|Biedermeier|  refers to the literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the years 1815 , the end of the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , and 1848, the year of the  |European_revolutions|Revolutions_Of_1848| . Under the  |Nazi_regime|Nazi| , some authors went into exile  and others submitted to censorship . The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to German language authors thirteen times , or the third most often after English and French language authors , with winners including  |Thomas_Mann|Thomas_Mann| ,  |Hermann_Hesse|Hermann_Hesse| , and  |Günter_Grass|Günter_Grass| .          |Periodization|Periodization|  is not an  |exact_science|Exact_Science|  but the following list contains movements or time periods typically used in discussing German literature. It seems worth noting that the periods of  |medieval|Medieval|  German literature span two or three centuries, those of early modern German literature span one century, and those of modern German literature each span one or two decades. The closer one nears the present, the more debated the periodizations become.       |Old_High_German_literature|Old_High_German_Literature| |Middle_High_German_literature|Middle_High_German_Literature| |Late_medieval_German_literature/Renaissance|Late_Middle_Ages|    Early Modern German literature     |Humanism|Humanism_In_Germany|  and  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| |Baroque|German_Literature_Of_The_Baroque_Period| |Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment|    Modern German literature   18th- and 19th-century German literature    |Empfindsamkeit_/_Sensibility|Sensibility| |Sturm_und_Drang_/_Storm_and_Stress|Sturm_Und_Drang|    German Classicism    |Weimar_Classicism|Weimar_Classicism|  or , depending on Schillers or Goethes death    |German_Romanticism|German_Romanticism| |Biedermeier|Biedermeier| |Young_Germany|Young_Germany|    Poetic  |Realism|Realism| |Naturalism|Naturalism|    20th-century German literature   1900–1933    |Fin_de_siècle|Fin_De_Siècle| |Symbolism|Symbolism| |Expressionism|Expressionism| |Dada|Dada| |New_Objectivity|New_Objectivity|     1933–1945   National Socialist literature   Exile literature   1945–1989   By country   Federal Republic of Germany   German Democratic Republic   Austria   Switzerland   Other   By thematic or group   Post-war literature    |Group_47|Group_47| |Holocaust_literature|Holocaust_Literature|  Medieval German literature refers to  |literature|Literature|  written in Germany, stretching from the  |Carolingian_dynasty|Carolingian_Dynasty| ; various dates have been given for the end of the German literary Middle Ages, the  |Reformation|Protestant_Reformation|  being the last possible cut-off point.          The Old High German period is reckoned to run until about the mid-11th century, though the boundary to Early Middle High German is not clear-cut.     The most famous work in OHG is the  Hildebrandslied , a short piece of Germanic alliterative heroic verse which besides the  Muspilli  is the sole survivor of what must have been a vast oral tradition. Another important work, in the northern dialect of Old Saxon, is a life of Christ in the style of a heroic epic known as the  Heliand .           |Middle_High_German|Middle_High_German|  proper runs from the beginning of the 12th century, and in the second half of the 12th century, there was a sudden intensification of activity, leading to a 60-year golden age of medieval German literature referred to as the mittelhochdeutsche Blütezeit . This was the period of the blossoming of MHG lyric poetry, particularly  Minnesang  . One of the most important of these poets was  |Walther_von_der_Vogelweide|Walther_Von_Der_Vogelweide| . The same sixty years saw the composition of the most important courtly romances. These are written in rhyming couplets, and again draw on French models such as  |Chrétien_de_Troyes|Chrétien_De_Troyes| , many of them relating  |Arthurian|Arthurian|  material, for example,  Parzival  by  |Wolfram_von_Eschenbach|Wolfram_Von_Eschenbach| . The third literary movement of these years was a new revamping of the heroic tradition, in which the ancient Germanic oral tradition can still be discerned, but tamed and Christianized and adapted for the court. These high medieval  |heroic_epics|Heroic_Epic|  are written in rhymed strophes, not the alliterative verse of Germanic prehistory .     The Middle High German period is conventionally taken to end in 1350, while the  |Early_New_High_German|Early_New_High_German|  is taken to begin with the  |German_Renaissance|German_Renaissance| , after the invention of movable type in the mid-15th century. Therefore, the literature of the late 14th and the early 15th century falls, as it were, in the cracks between Middle and New High German, and can be classified as either. Works of this transitional period include  The Ring  , the poems of  |Oswald_von_Wolkenstein|Oswald_Von_Wolkenstein|  and  |Johannes_von_Tepl|Johannes_Von_Tepl| , the German versions of  Pontus and Sidonia , and arguably the works of  |Hans_Folz|Hans_Folz|  and  |Sebastian_Brant|Sebastian_Brant|  , among others. The Volksbuch  tradition which would flourish in the 16th century also finds its origin in the second half of the 15th century.                        |Sebastian_Brant|Sebastian_Brant| |Thomas_Murner|Thomas_Murner| |Philipp_Melanchthon|Philipp_Melanchthon| |Sebastian_Franck|Sebastian_Franck|          The Baroque period was one of the most fertile times in German literature. Many writers reflected the horrible experiences of the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| , in  |poetry|Poetry|  and  |prose|Prose| .  |Grimmelshausens|Hans_Jakob_Christoffel_Von_Grimmelshausen|  adventures of the young and naïve Simplicissimus, in the eponymous book  Simplicius Simplicissimus ,  became the most famous novel of the Baroque period.  |Martin_Opitz|Martin_Opitz|  established rules for the purity of language, style, verse and rhyme.  |Andreas_Gryphius|Andreas_Gryphius|  and  |Daniel_Caspar_von_Lohenstein|Daniel_Caspar_Von_Lohenstein|  wrote German language  |tragedies|Tragedy| , or Trauerspiele, often on Classical themes and frequently quite violent. Erotic, religious and  |occasional_poetry|Occasional_Poetry|  appeared in both German and Latin.  |Sibylle_Ursula_von_Braunschweig-Lüneburg|Sibylle_Ursula_Von_Braunschweig-Lüneburg|  wrote part of a novel, Die Durchlauchtige Syrerin Aramena , which when complete would be the most famous courtly novel in German Baroque literature; it was finished by her brother  |Anton_Ulrich|Anthony_Ulrich,_Duke_Of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|  and edited by  |Sigmund_von_Birken|Sigmund_Von_Birken| .                            Empfindsamkeit / Sensibility    |Friedrich_Gottlieb_Klopstock|Friedrich_Gottlieb_Klopstock|  ,  |Christian_Fürchtegott_Gellert|Christian_Fürchtegott_Gellert|  ,  |Sophie_de_La_Roche|Sophie_De_La_Roche|  . The period culminates and ends in  |Goethes|Goethe|  best-selling  Die Leiden des jungen Werther  .            Sturm und Drang  is the name of a movement in German literature and  |music|Music|  taking place from the late 1760s through the early 1780s in which individual  |subjectivity|Subjectivity|  and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in response to the confines of rationalism imposed by  |the_Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment|  and associated  |aesthetic|Aesthetic|  movements. The philosopher  |Johann_Georg_Hamann|Johann_Georg_Hamann|  is considered to be the ideologue of Sturm und Drang, and  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe|  was a notable proponent of the movement, though he and  |Friedrich_Schiller|Friedrich_Schiller|  ended their period of association with it, initiating what would become  |Weimar_Classicism|Weimar_Classicism| .              Weimar Classicism  is a  |cultural|Cultural_Movement|  and  |literary_movement|Literary_Movement|  of  |Europe|Europe| , and its central ideas were originally propounded by  |Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe|  and  |Johann_Christoph_Friedrich_von_Schiller|Johann_Christoph_Friedrich_Von_Schiller|  during the period 1786 to 1805.        German Romanticism  was the dominant movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. German Romanticism developed relatively late compared to its  |English|English_Language|  counterpart, coinciding in its early years with the movement known as  |German_Classicism|German_Classicism|  or  |Weimar_Classicism|Weimar_Classicism| , which it opposed. In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety is notable for valuing humor and wit as well as beauty. The early German romantics tried to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, looking to the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  as a simpler, more integrated period. As time went on, however, they became increasingly aware of the tenuousness of the unity they were seeking. Later German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the everyday world and the seemingly irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius.  |Heinrich_Heine|Heinrich_Heine|  in particular criticized the tendency of the early romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.    |G.W.F._Hegel|G.W.F._Hegel| |E.T.A._Hoffmann|E.T.A._Hoffmann| |Friedrich_Hölderlin|Friedrich_Hölderlin| |Heinrich_von_Kleist|Heinrich_Von_Kleist| |Novalis|Novalis| |Friedrich_Schlegel|Karl_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Schlegel| |August_Wilhelm_Schlegel|August_Wilhelm_Schlegel| |Friedrich_Schleiermacher|Friedrich_Schleiermacher| |Ludwig_Tieck|Ludwig_Tieck| |Ludwig_Uhland|Ludwig_Uhland| |Arthur_Schopenhauer|Arthur_Schopenhauer| |Joseph_von_Eichendorff|Joseph_Von_Eichendorff|         Biedermeier  refers to work in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the years 1815 , the end of the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , and 1848, the year of the  |European_revolutions|Revolutions_Of_1848|  and contrasts with the  |Romantic|Romanticism|  era which preceded it. Typical Biedermeier poets are  |Annette_von_Droste-Hülshoff|Annette_Von_Droste-Hülshoff| ,  |Adelbert_von_Chamisso|Adelbert_Von_Chamisso| ,  |Eduard_Mörike|Eduard_Mörike| , and  |Wilhelm_Müller|Wilhelm_Müller| , the last three named having well-known musical settings by  |Robert_Schumann|Robert_Schumann| ,  |Hugo_Wolf|Hugo_Wolf|  and  |Franz_Schubert|Franz_Schubert|  respectively.      Young Germany   was a loose group of  Vormärz  writers which existed from about 1830 to 1850. It was essentially a youth movement . Its main proponents were  |Karl_Gutzkow|Karl_Gutzkow| ,  |Heinrich_Laube|Heinrich_Laube| ,  |Theodor_Mundt|Theodor_Mundt|  and  |Ludolf_Wienbarg|Ludolf_Wienbarg| ;  |Heinrich_Heine|Heinrich_Heine| ,  |Ludwig_Börne|Ludwig_Börne|  and  |Georg_Büchner|Georg_Büchner|  were also considered part of the movement.
