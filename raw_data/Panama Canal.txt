                 The Panama Canal  is an artificial  waterway in  |Panama|Panama|  that connects the  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean|  with the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| . The  |canal|Canal|  cuts across the  |Isthmus_of_Panama|Isthmus_Of_Panama|  and is a  |conduit|Channel|  for maritime trade.  |Canal_locks|Canal_Lock|  are at each end to lift  |ships|Ship|  up to  |Gatun_Lake|Gatun_Lake| , an  |artificial_lake|Reservoir|  created to reduce the amount of  |excavation_work|Digging|  required for the canal, 26  m  |above_sea_level|Above_Mean_Sea_Level| , and then lower the ships at the other end. The original locks are 34  m wide. A  |third,_wider_lane_of_locks|Panama_Canal_Expansion_Project|  was  |constructed|Construction|  between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger,  |neo-Panamax|New_Panamax|  ships, capable of handling more cargo.      |France|France|  began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped due to  |engineering|Engineering|  problems and a high worker  |mortality_rate|Mortality_Rate| . The  |United_States|United_States|  took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous  |Cape_Horn|Cape_Horn|  route around the southernmost tip of  |South_America|South_America|  via the  |Drake_Passage|Drake_Passage|  or  |Strait_of_Magellan|Strait_Of_Magellan|  and the even less popular route through the  |Arctic_Archipelago|Arctic_Archipelago|  and the  |Bering_Strait|Bering_Strait| .      |Colombia|Colombia| , France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding  |Panama_Canal_Zone|Panama_Canal_Zone|  until the 1977  |Torrijos–Carter_Treaties|Torrijos–Carter_Treaties|  provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, in 1999, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government. It is now managed and operated by the government-owned  |Panama_Canal_Authority|Panama_Canal_Authority| .      |Annual|Yearly| |traffic|Traffic|  has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million  |Panama_Canal/Universal_Measurement_System_tons|Measurement_Ton| . By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal.  It takes 11.38 hours to pass through the Panama Canal.  The  |American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers|American_Society_Of_Civil_Engineers|  has ranked the Panama Canal one of the  |seven_wonders_of_the_modern_world|Seven_Wonders_Of_The_Modern_World| .                    The earliest mention of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama occurred in 1534, when  |Charles_V|Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| ,  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  and King of Spain, ordered a survey for a route through the Americas that would ease the voyage for ships traveling between Spain and  |Peru|Peru| . Such a route would have given the Spanish a military advantage over the Portuguese. ; Chapter 3, http://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/early.html Some Early Canal Plans     In 1668, the English physician and philosopher  |Sir_Thomas_Browne|Sir_Thomas_Browne|  speculated in his encyclopaedic endeavour  Pseudodoxia Epidemica  - some Isthmus have been eat through by the Sea, and others cut by the spade: And if policy would permit, that of Panama in America were most worthy the attempt: it being but few miles over, and would open a shorter cut unto the East Indies and China .      In 1788, American  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| , then Minister to France, suggested that the Spanish should build the canal since it would be a less treacherous route for ships than going around the southern tip of South America, and that tropical ocean currents would naturally widen the canal thereafter.  During an expedition from 1788 to 1793,  |Alessandro_Malaspina|Alessandro_Malaspina|  outlined plans for its construction. ;online at      Given the strategic location of Panama and the potential offered by its narrow isthmus separating two great oceans, other trade links in the area were attempted over the years. The ill-fated  |Darien_scheme|Darien_Scheme|  was launched by the  |Kingdom_of_Scotland|Kingdom_Of_Scotland|  in 1698 to set up an overland  |trade_route|Trade_Route| . Generally inhospitable conditions thwarted the effort and it was abandoned in April 1700.      Numerous canals were built in other countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The success of the  |Erie_Canal|Erie_Canal|  in the United States in the 1820s and the collapse of the  |Spanish_Empire|Spanish_Empire|  in Latin America led to a surge of American interest in building an inter-oceanic canal. Beginning in 1826, US officials began negotiations with  |Gran_Colombia|Gran_Colombia|  , hoping to gain a concession for the building of a canal. Jealous of their newly obtained independence and fearing that they would be dominated by an American presence, the president  |Simón_Bolívar|Simón_Bolívar|  and New Granada officials declined American offers. The new nation was politically unstable, and Panama rebelled several times during the 19th century.     Another effort was made in 1843. According to the New York Daily Tribune, August 24, 1843, a contract was entered into by Barings of London and the  |Republic_of_New_Granada|Republic_Of_New_Granada|  for the construction of a canal across the  |Isthmus_of_Darien|Isthmus_Of_Darien|  . They referred to it as the Atlantic and Pacific Canal, and it was a wholly British endeavor. It was expected to be completed in five years, but the plan was never carried out. At nearly the same time, other ideas were floated, including a canal across Mexicos  |Isthmus_of_Tehuantepec|Isthmus_Of_Tehuantepec| .
