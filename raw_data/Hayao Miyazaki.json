    {
        " in reference to his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as brave, self-sufficient girls that dont think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart , stating that they may need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour and that any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man . Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly the protagonist Nausicaä. Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazakis films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a coming of age element for the heroines in Miyazakis films, as they each discover individual personality and strengths . Gabrielle Bellot of  The Atlantic  wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what it might mean to be a woman . In particular, Bellot cites Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, praising the films challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausicaä. Bellot also noted that Princess Mononokes San represents the conflict between selfhood and expression .     Miyazaki is concerned with the sense of wonder in young people, seeking to maintain themes of love and family in his films. Michael Toscano of Curator found that Miyazaki fears Japanese children are dimmed by a culture of overconsumption, overprotection, utilitarian education, careerism, techno-industrialism, and a secularism that is swallowing Japan’s native animism . Schellhase wrote that several of Miyazakis works feature themes of love and romance, but felt that emphasis is placed on the way lonely and vulnerable individuals are integrated into relationships of mutual reliance and responsibility, which generally benefit everyone around them . He also found that many of the protagonists in Miyazakis films present an idealized image of families, whereas others are dysfunctional. He felt that the non-biological family in Howls Moving Castle gives a message of hope: that those cast out by society can find a healthy place to belong .       Miyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing the films narrative as he designs the storyboards. We never know where the story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops, he said. In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to enrich the visual look , though he ensures that each film can retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D .
