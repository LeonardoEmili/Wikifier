                    Niels Henrik David Bohr  was a Danish  |physicist|Physicist|  who made foundational contributions to understanding  |atomic_structure|Atomic_Structure|  and  |quantum_theory|Old_Quantum_Theory| , for which he received the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  in 1922. Bohr was also a  |philosopher|Philosopher|  and a promoter of scientific research.     Bohr developed the  |Bohr_model|Bohr_Model|  of the  |atom|Atom| , in which he proposed that energy levels of  |electrons|Electron|  are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  but can jump from one energy level to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of  |complementarity|Complementarity| |wave_or_a_stream_of_particles|Wave–Particle_Duality| . The notion of complementarity dominated Bohrs thinking in both science and philosophy.     Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the  |University_of_Copenhagen|University_Of_Copenhagen| , now known as the  |Niels_Bohr_Institute|Niels_Bohr_Institute| , which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including  |Hans_Kramers|Hans_Kramers| ,  |Oskar_Klein|Oskar_Klein| ,  |George_de_Hevesy|George_De_Hevesy| , and  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg| . He predicted the existence of a new  |zirconium|Zirconium| -like element, which was named  |hafnium|Hafnium| , after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element  |bohrium|Bohrium|  was named after him.     During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from  |Nazism|Nazism| . After  |Denmark_was_occupied_by_the_Germans|German_Invasion_Of_Denmark| , he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the  |German_nuclear_weapon_project|German_Nuclear_Weapon_Project| . In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British  |Tube_Alloys|Tube_Alloys|  nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project| . After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of  |CERN|Cern|  and the  |Research_Establishment_Risø_of_the_Danish_Atomic_Energy_Commission|Risø_Dtu_National_Laboratory_For_Sustainable_Energy|  and became the first chairman of the  |Nordic_Institute_for_Theoretical_Physics|Nordic_Institute_For_Theoretical_Physics|  in 1957.       Bohr was born in  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen| , Denmark, on 7 October 1885, the second of three children of  |Christian_Bohr|Christian_Bohr| ,   a professor of  |physiology|Physiology|  at the University of Copenhagen, and Ellen Adler Bohr, who came from a wealthy  |Danish_Jewish|Danish_Jews|  family prominent in banking and parliamentary circles. He had an elder sister, Jenny, and a younger brother  |Harald|Harald_Bohr| . Jenny became a teacher, while Harald became a  |mathematician|Mathematician|  and  |footballer|Association_Football|  who played for the  |Danish_national_team|Denmark_National_Football_Team|  at the  |1908_Summer_Olympics|1908_Summer_Olympics|  in London. Niels was a passionate footballer as well, and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen-based  |Akademisk_Boldklub|Akademisk_Boldklub|  , with Niels as  |goalkeeper|Goalkeeper| . There is no truth in the oft-repeated claim that Bohr emulated his brother, Harald, by playing for the Danish national team.         Bohr was educated at Gammelholm Latin School, starting when he was seven.  In 1903, Bohr enrolled as an undergraduate at  |Copenhagen_University|Copenhagen_University| . His major was physics, which he studied under Professor  |Christian_Christiansen|Christian_Christiansen| , the universitys only professor of physics at that time. He also studied astronomy and mathematics under Professor  |Thorvald_Thiele|Thorvald_Thiele| , and philosophy under Professor  |Harald_Høffding|Harald_Høffding| , a friend of his father.      In 1905, a gold medal competition was sponsored by the  |Royal_Danish_Academy_of_Sciences_and_Letters|Royal_Danish_Academy_Of_Sciences_And_Letters|  to investigate a method for measuring the  |surface_tension|Surface_Tension|  of liquids that had been proposed by  |Lord_Rayleigh|John_Strutt,_3Rd_Baron_Rayleigh|  in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his fathers laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to  |make_his_own_glassware|Glass_Blowing| , creating test tubes with the required  |elliptical|Ellipse|  cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleighs theory and his method, by taking into account the  |viscosity|Viscosity|  of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  in London for publication in the  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society .      Harald became the first of the two Bohr brothers to earn a  |masters_degree|Masters_Degree| , which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his on the electron theory of metals, a topic assigned by his supervisor, Christiansen. Bohr subsequently elaborated his masters thesis into his much-larger  |Doctor_of_Philosophy|Doctor_Of_Philosophy|  thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by  |Paul_Drude|Paul_Drude|  and elaborated by  |Hendrik_Lorentz|Hendrik_Lorentz| , in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentzs model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the  |Hall_effect|Hall_Effect| , and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911,  and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohrs thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist  |Hendrika_Johanna_van_Leeuwen|Hendrika_Johanna_Van_Leeuwen|  would independently derive a theorem from Bohrs thesis that is today known as the  |Bohr–van_Leeuwen_theorem|Bohr–Van_Leeuwen_Theorem| .        In 1910, Bohr met Margrethe Nørlund, the sister of the mathematician  |Niels_Erik_Nørlund|Niels_Erik_Nørlund| . Bohr resigned his membership in the  |Church_of_Denmark|Church_Of_Denmark|  on 16 April 1912, and he and Margrethe were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall in  |Slagelse|Slagelse|  on 1 August. Years later, his brother Harald similarly left the church before getting married. Bohr and Margrethe had six sons. The oldest, Christian, died in a boating accident in 1934, and another, Harald, died from childhood meningitis.  |Aage_Bohr|Aage_Bohr|  became a successful physicist, and in 1975 was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, like his father.  became a physician; , a chemical engineer; and  |Ernest|Ernest_Bohr| , a lawyer.  Like his uncle Harald, Ernest Bohr became an Olympic athlete, playing  |field_hockey|Field_Hockey|  for Denmark at the  |1948_Summer_Olympics|1948_Summer_Olympics|  in London.               In September 1911, Bohr, supported by a fellowship from the  |Carlsberg_Foundation|Carlsberg_Foundation| , travelled to England. At the time, it was where most of the theoretical work on the structure of atoms and molecules was being done. He met  |J._J._Thomson|J._J._Thomson|  of the  |Cavendish_Laboratory|Cavendish_Laboratory|  and  |Trinity_College,_Cambridge|Trinity_College,_Cambridge| . He attended lectures on  |electromagnetism|Electromagnetism|  given by  |James_Jeans|James_Jeans|  and  |Joseph_Larmor|Joseph_Larmor| , and did some research on  |cathode_rays|Cathode_Ray| , but failed to impress Thomson. He had more success with younger physicists like the Australian  |William_Lawrence_Bragg|William_Lawrence_Bragg| , and New Zealands  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford| , whose 1911 small central nucleus  |Rutherford_model|Rutherford_Model|  of the  |atom|Atom|  had challenged Thomsons 1904  |plum_pudding_model|Plum_Pudding_Model| . Bohr received an invitation from Rutherford to conduct post-doctoral work at  |Victoria_University_of_Manchester|Victoria_University_Of_Manchester| , where Bohr met  |George_de_Hevesy|George_De_Hevesy|  and  |Charles_Galton_Darwin|Charles_Galton_Darwin|  .     Bohr returned to Denmark in July 1912 for his wedding, and travelled around England and Scotland on his honeymoon. On his return, he became a  privatdocent  at the University of Copenhagen, giving lectures on  |thermodynamics|Thermodynamics| .  |Martin_Knudsen|Martin_Knudsen|  put Bohrs name forward for a  docent , which was approved in July 1913, and Bohr then began teaching medical students. His three papers, which later became famous as the trilogy , were published in  Philosophical Magazine  in July, September and November of that year.     He adapted Rutherfords nuclear structure to  |Max_Plancks|Max_Planck|  quantum theory and so created his  |Bohr_model|Bohr_Model|  of the atom.     Planetary models of atoms were not new, but Bohrs treatment was. Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin on the role of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point,   he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in  |orbits|Orbit|  around the atoms nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a  |quantum|Quantum|  of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the  |old_quantum_theory|Old_Quantum_Theory| .           In 1885,  |Johann_Balmer|Johann_Balmer|  had come up with his  |Balmer_series|Balmer_Series|  to describe the visible  |spectral_lines|Spectral_Line|  of a  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  atom:   :   R        n3,4,5,...   where λ is the wavelength of the absorbed or emitted light and R H is the  |Rydberg_constant|Rydberg_Constant| . Balmers formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines, but for thirty years, no one could explain why it worked. In the first paper of his trilogy, Bohr was able to derive it from his model:   : RZ   where m e is the electrons mass, e is its charge, h is  |Plancks_constant|Plancks_Constant|  and Z is the atoms  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  .     The models first hurdle was the  |Pickering_series|Pickering_Series| , lines which did not fit Balmers formula. When challenged on this by  |Alfred_Fowler|Alfred_Fowler| , Bohr replied that they were caused by  |ionised|Ionization| |helium|Helium| , helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and  |Hendrik_Lorentz|Hendrik_Lorentz| , did not like the trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford,  |David_Hilbert|David_Hilbert| ,  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein| ,  |Enrico_Fermi|Enrico_Fermi| ,  |Max_Born|Max_Born|  and  |Arnold_Sommerfeld|Arnold_Sommerfeld|  saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogys acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.     Bohr did not enjoy teaching medical students. He decided to return to Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a  |reader|Reader|  in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in  |Tyrol|South_Tyrol|  with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the  |University_of_Göttingen|University_Of_Göttingen|  and the  |Ludwig_Maximilian_University_of_Munich|Ludwig_Maximilian_University_Of_Munich| , where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohrs subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King  |Christian_X|Christian_X| , who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.       In April 1917, Bohr began a campaign to establish an Institute of Theoretical Physics. He gained the support of the Danish government and the Carlsberg Foundation, and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors, many of them Jewish. Legislation establishing the Institute was passed in November 1918. Now known as the  |Niels_Bohr_Institute|Niels_Bohr_Institute| , it opened on 3 March 1921, with Bohr as its director. His family moved into an apartment on the first floor.   Bohrs institute served as a focal point for researchers into  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s, when most of the worlds best known theoretical physicists spent some time in his company. Early arrivals included  |Hans_Kramers|Hans_Kramers|  from the Netherlands,  |Oskar_Klein|Oskar_Klein|  from Sweden, George de Hevesy from Hungary,  |Wojciech_Rubinowicz|Wojciech_Rubinowicz|  from Poland and  |Svein_Rosseland|Svein_Rosseland|  from Norway. Bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague. Klein and Rosseland produced the Institutes first publication even before it opened.        The Bohr model worked well for hydrogen, but could not explain more complex elements. By 1919, Bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus and developed  |heuristics|Heuristic|  to describe them. The  |rare-earth_elements|Rare-Earth_Element|  posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar. An important development came in 1924 with  |Wolfgang_Paulis|Wolfgang_Pauli|  discovery of the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| , which put Bohrs models on a firm theoretical footing. Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of  |zirconium|Zirconium| . He was immediately challenged by the French chemist  |Georges_Urbain|Georges_Urbain| , who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called celtium . At the Institute in Copenhagen,  |Dirk_Coster|Dirk_Coster|  and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong. Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. They went through samples from Copenhagens Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. The element, which they named  |hafnium|Hafnium|   turned out to be more common than gold.     In 1922, Bohr was awarded the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them . The award thus recognised both the Trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics. For his Nobel lecture, Bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the  |correspondence_principle|Correspondence_Principle| , which he had formulated. This states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces  |classical_physics|Classical_Physics|  in the limit of large  |quantum_numbers|Quantum_Number| .     The discovery of  |Compton_scattering|Compton_Scattering|  by  |Arthur_Holly_Compton|Arthur_Holly_Compton|  in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of  |photons|Photon| , and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and  |John_C._Slater|John_C._Slater| , an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the  |Bohr–Kramers–Slater_theory|Bohr–Kramers–Slater_Theory|  . It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.       Modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using virtual oscillators at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born,  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg|  and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They led to the development of  |matrix_mechanics|Matrix_Mechanics| , the first form of modern  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| . The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by  |Walther_Bothe|Walther_Bothe|  and  |Hans_Geiger|Hans_Geiger| . In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible .       The introduction of  |spin|Spin|  by  |George_Uhlenbeck|George_Uhlenbeck|  and  |Samuel_Goudsmit|Samuel_Goudsmit|  in November 1925 was a milestone. The next month, Bohr travelled to  |Leiden|Leiden|  to attend celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Hendrick Lorentz receiving his doctorate. When his train stopped in  |Hamburg|Hamburg| , he was met by Wolfgang Pauli and  |Otto_Stern|Otto_Stern| , who asked for his opinion of the spin theory. Bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields. When he arrived in Leiden,  |Paul_Ehrenfest|Paul_Ehrenfest|  and Albert Einstein informed Bohr that Einstein had resolved this problem using  |relativity|Theory_Of_Relativity| . Bohr then had Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit incorporate this into their paper. Thus, when he met Werner Heisenberg and  |Pascual_Jordan|Pascual_Jordan|  in  |Göttingen|Göttingen|  on the way back, he had become, in his own words, a prophet of the electron magnet gospel .          Heisenberg first came to Copenhagen in 1924, then returned to Göttingen in June 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. When he showed his results to Max Born in Göttingen, Born realised that they could best be expressed using  |matrices|Matrix| . This work attracted the attention of the British physicist  |Paul_Dirac|Paul_Dirac| , who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926. Austrian physicist  |Erwin_Schrödinger|Erwin_Schrödinger|  also visited in 1926. His attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed Bohr, who believed it contributed so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics .     When Kramers left the Institute in 1926 to take up a chair as professor of theoretical physics at the  |Utrecht_University|Utrecht_University| , Bohr arranged for Heisenberg to return and take Kramerss place as a  lektor  at the University of Copenhagen. Heisenberg worked in Copenhagen as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr from 1926 to 1927.     Bohr became convinced that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the  |de_Broglie_hypothesis|De_Broglie_Hypothesis|  that matter also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of  |complementarity|Complementarity|  He felt that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers.     In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg developed his  |uncertainty_principle|Uncertainty_Principle| , which Bohr embraced. In a paper he presented at the  |Volta_Conference|Volta_Conference|  at  |Como|Como|  in September 1927, he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had  |good-natured_arguments|Bohr–Einstein_Debates|  over such issues throughout their lives.     In 1914,  |Carl_Jacobsen|Carl_Jacobsen| , the heir to  |Carlsberg_breweries|Carlsberg_Group| , bequeathed his mansion to be used for life by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts, as an honorary residence . Harald Høffding had been the first occupant, and upon his death in July 1931, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters gave Bohr occupancy. He and his family moved there in 1932. He was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 1939.     By 1929, the phenomenon of  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay|  prompted Bohr to again suggest that the  |law_of_conservation_of_energy|Law_Of_Conservation_Of_Energy|  be abandoned, but  |Enrico_Fermis|Enrico_Fermi|  hypothetical  |neutrino|Neutrino|  and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the  |neutron|Neutron|  provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the  |compound_nucleus|Compound_Nucleus|  in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.      The discovery of  |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission|  by  |Otto_Hahn|Otto_Hahn|  in December 1938  generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told  |George_Placzek|George_Placzek|  that this resolved all the mysteries of  |transuranic_elements|Transuranic_Elements| , Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek,  |Léon_Rosenfeld|Léon_Rosenfeld|  and  |John_Wheeler|John_Archibald_Wheeler|  that I have understood everything.  Based on his  |liquid_drop_model|Liquid_Drop_Model|  of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the  |uranium-235|Uranium-235|  isotope and not the more abundant  |uranium-238|Uranium-238|  that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940,  |John_R._Dunning|John_R._Dunning|  demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission .        Bohr read the 19th-century Danish  |Christian_existentialist|Christian_Existentialist|  philosopher,  |Søren_Kierkegaard|Søren_Kierkegaard| .  |Richard_Rhodes|Richard_Rhodes|  argued in  The Making of the Atomic Bomb  that Bohr was influenced by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaards  Stages on Lifes Way  as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, It is the only thing I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better  ... I even think it is one of the most delightful things I have ever read. Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaards language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with  |Kierkegaards_philosophy|Philosophy_Of_Søren_Kierkegaard| . Some of Bohrs biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaards advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an  |atheist|Atheist| .  |David_Favrholdt|David_Favrholdt|  argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohrs work, taking Bohrs statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value, while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.       The rise of  |Nazism|Nazism|  in Germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries, either because they were Jewish or because they were political opponents of the Nazi regime. In 1933, the  |Rockefeller_Foundation|Rockefeller_Foundation|  created a fund to help support refugee academics, and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation,  |Max_Mason|Max_Mason| , in May 1933 during a visit to the United States. Bohr offered the refugees temporary jobs at the Institute, provided them with financial support, arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, and ultimately found them places at institutions around the world. Those that he helped included  |Guido_Beck|Guido_Beck| ,  |Felix_Bloch|Felix_Bloch| ,  |James_Franck|James_Franck| , George de Hevesy,  |Otto_Frisch|Otto_Frisch| ,  |Hilde_Levi|Hilde_Levi| ,  |Lise_Meitner|Lise_Meitner| , George Placzek,  |Eugene_Rabinowitch|Eugene_Rabinowitch| ,  |Stefan_Rozental|Stefan_Rozental| , Erich Ernst Schneider,  |Edward_Teller|Edward_Teller| ,  |Arthur_von_Hippel|Arthur_R._Von_Hippel|  and  |Victor_Weisskopf|Victor_Weisskopf| .     In April 1940, early in the Second World War,  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| |invaded_and_occupied_Denmark|Occupation_Of_Denmark| . To prevent the Germans from discovering  |Max_von_Laues|Max_Von_Laue|  and James Francks gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| . In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohrs own medal had been donated to an auction to the Fund for Finnish Relief, and was auctioned off in March 1940, along with the medal of  |August_Krogh|August_Krogh| . The buyer later donated the two medals to the Danish Historical Museum in  |Frederiksborg_Castle|Frederiksborg_Castle| , where they are still kept.      Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.          Bohr was aware of the possibility of using uranium-235 to construct an  |atomic_bomb|Atomic_Bomb| , referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the  |German_nuclear_energy_project|German_Nuclear_Energy_Project| , visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.   According to Heisenberg, he began to address nuclear energy, morality and the war, to which Bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving Heisenberg hints about his own opinions.  |Ivan_Supek|Ivan_Supek| , one of Heisenbergs students and friends, claimed that the main subject of the meeting was  |Carl_Friedrich_von_Weizsäcker|Carl_Friedrich_Von_Weizsäcker| , who had proposed trying to persuade Bohr to mediate peace between Britain and Germany.  An interview with Ivan Supek relating to the 1941 Bohr  – Heisenberg meeting.     In 1957, Heisenberg wrote to  |Robert_Jungk|Robert_Jungk| , who was then working on the book  Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists . Heisenberg explained that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists, that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts, and this raised enormous responsibilities on the worlds scientists on both sides.  When Bohr saw Jungks depiction in the Danish translation of the book, he drafted a letter to Heisenberg, stating that he never understood the purpose of Heisenbergs visit, was shocked by Heisenbergs opinion that Germany would win the war, and that atomic weapons could be decisive.       |Michael_Frayns|Michael_Frayn|  1998 play  Copenhagen  explores what might have happened at the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr.  A  |BBC|Bbc| |television_film_version|Copenhagen|  of the play was first screened on 26 September 2002, with  |Stephen_Rea|Stephen_Rea|  as Bohr, and  |Daniel_Craig|Daniel_Craig|  as Heisenberg. The same meeting had previously been dramatised by the BBCs  Horizon  science documentary series in 1992, with  |Anthony_Bate|Anthony_Bate|  as Bohr, and Philip Anthony as Heisenberg. Horizon: Hitlers Bomb,  |BBC_Two|Bbc_Two| , 24 February 1992 The meeting is also dramatized in the Norwegian/Danish/British miniseries  The Heavy Water War .        In September 1943, word reached Bohr and his brother Harald that the Nazis considered their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, and that they were therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King  |Gustaf_V_of_Sweden|Gustaf_V_Of_Sweden|  to make public Swedens willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass  |rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews|Rescue_Of_The_Danish_Jews|  by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohrs actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.        When the news of Bohrs escape reached Britain,  |Lord_Cherwell|Lord_Cherwell|  sent a telegram to Bohr asking him to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a  |de_Havilland_Mosquito|De_Havilland_Mosquito|  operated by the  |British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation|British_Overseas_Airways_Corporation|  . The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircrafts  |bomb_bay|Bomb_Bay| . During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilots intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohrs son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.     Bohr was warmly received by  |James_Chadwick|James_Chadwick|  and Sir  |John_Anderson|John_Anderson,_1St_Viscount_Waverley| , but for security reasons Bohr was kept out of sight. He was given an apartment at  |St_Jamess_Palace|St_Jamess_Palace|  and an office with the British  |Tube_Alloys|Tube_Alloys|  nuclear weapons development team. Bohr was astonished at the amount of progress that had been made. Chadwick arranged for Bohr to visit the United States as a Tube Alloys consultant, with Aage as his assistant. On 8 December 1943, Bohr arrived in  |Washington,_D.C.|Washington,_D.C.| , where he met with the director of the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project| , Brigadier General  |Leslie_R._Groves,_Jr.|Leslie_R._Groves,_Jr.|  He visited Einstein and Pauli at the  |Institute_for_Advanced_Study|Institute_For_Advanced_Study|  in  |Princeton,_New_Jersey|Princeton,_New_Jersey| , and went to  |Los_Alamos|Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory|  in  |New_Mexico|New_Mexico| , where the nuclear weapons were being designed. For security reasons, he went under the name of Nicholas Baker in the United States, while Aage became James Baker . In May 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper  |De_frie_Danske|De_Frie_Danske|  reported that they had learned that the famous son of Denmark Professor Niels Bohr in October the previous year had fled his country via Sweden to London and from there travelled to  |Moscow|Moscow|  from where he could be assumed to support the war effort.      Bohr did not remain at Los Alamos, but paid a series of extended visits over the course of the next two years.  |Robert_Oppenheimer|Robert_Oppenheimer|  credited Bohr with acting as a scientific father figure to the younger men , most notably  |Richard_Feynman|Richard_Feynman| . Bohr is quoted as saying, They didnt need my help in making the atom bomb.  Oppenheimer gave Bohr credit for an important contribution to the work on  |modulated_neutron_initiators|Modulated_Neutron_Initiator| . This device remained a stubborn puzzle, Oppenheimer noted, but in early February 1945 Niels Bohr clarified what had to be done.      Bohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations. In April 1944, he received a letter from  |Peter_Kapitza|Peter_Kapitza| , written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting. Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that we did not speak the same language . Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes.      Oppenheimer suggested that Bohr visit President  |Franklin_D._Roosevelt|Franklin_D._Roosevelt|  to convince him that the Manhattan Project should be shared with the Soviets in the hope of speeding up its results. Bohrs friend, Supreme Court Justice  |Felix_Frankfurter|Felix_Frankfurter| , informed President Roosevelt about Bohrs opinions, and a meeting between them took place on 26 August 1944. Roosevelt suggested that Bohr return to the United Kingdom to try to win British approval. When Churchill and Roosevelt met at Hyde Park on 19 September 1944, they rejected the idea of informing the world about the project, and the aide-mémoire of their conversation contained a rider that enquiries should be made regarding the activities of Professor Bohr and steps taken to ensure that he is responsible for no leakage of information, particularly to the Russians .     In June 1950, Bohr addressed an Open Letter to the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  calling for international cooperation on nuclear energy.  •   In the 1950s, after the  |Soviet_Unions_first_nuclear_weapon_test|Rds-1| , the  |International_Atomic_Energy_Agency|International_Atomic_Energy_Agency|  was created along the lines of Bohrs suggestion. In 1957 he received the first ever  |Atoms_for_Peace_Award|Atoms_For_Peace_Award| .           With the war now ended, Bohr returned to Copenhagen on 25 August 1945, and was re-elected President of the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences on 21 September. At a memorial meeting of the Academy on 17 October 1947 for King  |Christian_X|Christian_X_Of_Denmark| , who had died in April, the new king,  |Frederick_IX|Frederick_Ix_Of_Denmark| , announced that he was conferring the  |Order_of_the_Elephant|Order_Of_The_Elephant|  on Bohr. This award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state, but the king said that it honoured not just Bohr personally, but Danish science. Bohr designed his own  |coat_of_arms|Coat_Of_Arms|  which featured a  |taijitu|Taijitu|  and a motto in , opposites are complementary .       The Second World War demonstrated that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a  |brain_drain|Brain_Drain|  to the United States, twelve European countries banded together to create  |CERN|Cern| , a research organisation along the lines of the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake  |Big_Science|Big_Science|  projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site.  |Pierre_Auger|Pierre_Victor_Auger| , who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohrs presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and  |Geneva|Geneva|  was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957. Victor Weisskopf, who later became the  |Director_General_of_CERN|List_Of_Directors_General_Of_Cern| , summed up Bohrs role, saying that there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of  |CERN|Cern| . The enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it.       Meanwhile, Scandinavian countries formed the  |Nordic_Institute_for_Theoretical_Physics|Nordic_Institute_For_Theoretical_Physics|  in 1957, with Bohr as its chairman. He was also involved with the founding of the  |Research_Establishment_Risø_of_the_Danish_Atomic_Energy_Commission|Risø_Dtu_National_Laboratory_For_Sustainable_Energy| , and served as its first chairman from February 1956.     Bohr died of heart failure at his home in  |Carlsberg|Carlsberg|  on 18 November 1962.  He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the  |Assistens_Cemetery|Assistens_Cemetery|  in the  |Nørrebro|Nørrebro|  section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wifes ashes were also interred there. On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.            Bohr received numerous honours and accolades. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received the  |Hughes_Medal|Hughes_Medal|  in 1921, the  |Matteucci_Medal|Matteucci_Medal|  in 1923, the  |Franklin_Medal|Franklin_Medal|  in 1926,  the  |Copley_Medal|Copley_Medal|  in 1938, the Order of the Elephant in 1947, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1957 and the  |Sonning_Prize|Sonning_Prize|  in 1961. He became foreign member of the  |Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|Royal_Netherlands_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences|  in 1923,  and of the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  in 1926.  The Bohr models semicentennial was commemorated in Denmark on 21 November 1963 with a  |postage_stamp|Commemorative_Stamp|  depicting Bohr, the hydrogen atom and the formula for the difference of any two hydrogen energy levels: h    -   . Several other countries have also issued postage stamps depicting Bohr. In 1997, the  |Danish_National_Bank|Danish_National_Bank|  began circulating the  |500-krone_banknote|Banknotes_Of_Denmark,_1997_Series|  with the portrait of Bohr smoking a pipe.  An asteroid,  |3948_Bohr|3948_Bohr| , was named after him,  as was the  |Bohr_lunar_crater|Bohr|  and  |bohrium|Bohrium| , the chemical element with atomic number 107.
