A storytelling game is a  |game|Game|  where two or more persons collaborate on  |telling|Storytelling|  a spontaneous  |story|Plot| . Usually, each player takes care of one or more  |characters|Player_Character|  in the developing story. Some games in the tradition of  |role-playing_games|Role-Playing_Game|  require one participant to take the roles of the various supporting characters, as well as introducing non-character forces , but other systems dispense with this figure and distribute this function among all players.     Since this person usually sets the ground and setting for the story, he or she is often referred to as the storyteller or  |narrator|Narrator|  . Any number of other alternate forms may be used, many of which are variations on the term  |gamemaster|Gamemaster|  ; these variants are especially common in storytelling games derived from or similar to role-playing games.     In contrast to  |improv_theater|Improvisational_Theater| , storytelling gamers describe the actions of their characters rather than acting them out, except during  |dialogue|Dialogue|  or, in some games,  |monologue|Monologue| . However,  live action  versions exist, which are very much akin to theater except in the crucial absence of a non-participating audience.       The most popular modern storytelling games originated as a  |subgenre|Genre|  of  |role-playing_games|Role-Playing_Game| , where the game rules and statistics are heavily de-emphasised in favor of creating a believable story and immersive experience for all involved. So while in a conventional game the announcement that ones character is going to leap over a seven-meters-wide canyon will be greeted with the request to roll a number of  |dice|Dice| , a player in a storytelling game who wishes to have a character perform a similar feat will have to convince the others why it is both probable and keeping within the established traits of their character to successfully do so. As such, these games are a subclass of  |diceless_role-playing_games|Diceless_Role-Playing_Game| .     Not all players find the storytelling style of role-playing satisfying. Many role-playing gamers are more comfortable in a system that gives them less freedom, but where they do not need to police themselves; others find it easier to enjoy a system where a more concrete framework of rules is already present. These three types of player are discussed by the  |GNS_theory|Gns_Theory| .     Some  |role-playing_game_systems|Role-Playing_Game_System|  which describe themselves as storytelling games nevertheless use randomisers rather than story in the arbitration of the rules, often in the form of a  |contest|Competition|  of  |Rock,_Paper,_Scissors|Rock,_Paper,_Scissors|  or a  |card|Playing_Card|  drawn from a deck of cards. Such storytelling games are instead simplified or streamlined forms of traditional role-playing games. Conversely, most modern role-playing games encourage gamemasters to ignore their gaming systems if it makes for a more enjoyable story, even though they may not describe themselves as storytelling games.     A growing number of websites utilize a  |bulletin_board_system|Bulletin_Board_System| , in which the gaming is akin to  |Collaborative_Fiction|Collaborative_Fiction|  but known as a Literary Role-Playing Game . The players contribute to an ongoing story with defined parameters but no narrator or directing force. A moderator may oversee the gamers to ensure that the rules, guidelines and parameters of the gaming world are being upheld, but otherwise the writers are free to interact as players in an improvisational play. Many of these Literary RPGs are  |fan-fiction|Fan-Fiction|  based, such as  |Tolkiens|J._R._R._Tolkien| |Middle-earth|Middle-Earth| ,  |Star_Wars|Star_Wars| ,  |Harry_Potter|Harry_Potter| ,  |Twilight|Twilight| , any number of  |anime|Anime|  and  |manga|Manga|  sources, or they are simply based in thematic worlds such as the mythologies of  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| ,  |fairy_tales|Fairy_Tale| , the  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  or  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction| . Most often referred to as Literary RPGs and place a greater emphasis on writing skill and storytelling ability than on any sense of competition driven outcome.      |White_Wolf_Game_Studios|White_Wolf,_Inc.| |Storyteller_System|Storyteller_System| , which is used in  |World_of_Darkness|World_Of_Darkness|  role-playing games such as  Vampire: The Masquerade  and live-action games under the  |Minds_Eye_Theatre|Minds_Eye_Theatre|  imprint, is the best-known and most popular role-playing game described as a storytelling game .         An early design of a collaborative storytelling game not based in simulation was created by Chris Engle c. 1988   at Bloomingpedia with his Matrix Game.  official page In this system, a referee decides the likeliness of the facts proposed by the players, and those facts happen or are rejected according with a dice roll. Players can propose counter-arguments that are resolved in a dice rolling contest. A conflict round can follow to resolve any inconsistencies or further detail new plot points. Matrix Games are now presented in a board game format.     In 1999, game designer  |Ian_Millington|Ian_Millington|   developed an early work called Ergo  which established the basis for collaborative role-playing. It was designed with the rules of the  |Fudge|Fudge|  universal role-playing system in mind but added modifications necessary to get rid of the need for a gamemaster, distributing the responsibility for the game and story equally among all players and undoing the equivalence between player and character.     Modern rule systems  rely less on randomness and more in collaboration between players. This includes rules based on economic systems that force players to negotiate the details of the story, and solve conflicts based on the importance that they give to a given plot element and the resources theyre willing to spend to make it into the story.          Collaborative fiction is a form of storytelling which uses  |collaborative_writing|Collaborative_Writing|  as the primary medium, where a group of authors share creative control of a  |story|Storytelling| .
