        John Hanson  was a merchant and public official from  |Maryland|Maryland|  during the era of the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| . In 1779, Hanson was elected as a delegate to the  |Continental_Congress|Continental_Congress|  after serving in a variety of roles for the  |Patriot|Patriot|  cause in Maryland. He signed the  |Articles_of_Confederation|Articles_Of_Confederation|  in 1781 after Maryland finally joined the other states in ratifying them. In November 1781, he was elected as first  |President_of_the_Confederation_Congress|President_Of_The_Continental_Congress|  , following  |ratification|Ratification|  of the articles. For this reason, some of Hansons biographers have argued that he was actually the first holder of the office of  |president|President| .       John Hanson was born in  |Port_Tobacco_Parish|Port_Tobacco|  in  |Charles_County|Charles_County_Maryland|  in the  |Province_of_Maryland|Province_Of_Maryland|  on April 14, 1721. Sources published prior to a 1940 genealogical study sometimes listed his birth date as April 13 or his year of birth as 1715.     Hanson was born on a  |plantation|Plantations_In_The_American_South|  called Mulberry Grove into a wealthy and prominent family. His parents were Samuel and Elizabeth Hanson . Samuel Hanson was a planter who owned more than , and held a variety of political offices, including serving two terms in the  |Maryland_General_Assembly|Maryland_General_Assembly| .     John Hansons grandfather, also named John, came to Charles County, Maryland, as an  |indentured_servant|Indentured_Servant|  around 1661. In 1876, a writer named George Hanson placed John Hanson in his family tree of Swedish-Americans descended from four Swedish brothers who emigrated to  |New_Sweden|New_Sweden|  in 1642. This story was often repeated over the next century, but scholarly research in the late 20th century showed that John Hanson was not related to those Swedish-American Hansons.     Little is known about Hansons early life; he was presumably privately tutored as was customary among the wealthy of his time and place. He followed his fathers path as a planter, slave owner, and public official. He was often referred to as John Hanson, Jr., to distinguish him from an older man of the same name.       Hansons career in public service began in 1750, when he was appointed sheriff of Charles County. In 1757 he was elected to represent Charles County in the lower house of the Maryland General Assembly, where he served over the next twelve years, sitting on many important committees. Maryland was a  |proprietary_colony|Proprietary_Colony| , and Hanson aligned himself with the popular or country party, which opposed any expansion of the power of the proprietary governors at the expense of the popularly elected lower house. He was a leading opponent of the  |1765_Stamp_Act|Stamp_Act_1765| , chairing the committee that drafted the instructions for Marylands delegates to the  |Stamp_Act_Congress|Stamp_Act_Congress| . In protest of the  |Townshend_Acts|Townshend_Acts| , in 1769 Hanson was one of the signers of a nonimportation resolution that boycotted British imports until the acts were repealed.          Hanson changed course in 1769, apparently to better pursue his business interests. He resigned from the General Assembly, sold his land in Charles County, and moved to  |Frederick_County|Frederick_County_Maryland|  in  |western_Maryland|Western_Maryland| . There he held a variety of offices, including deputy surveyor, sheriff, and county treasurer.     When relations between  |Great_Britain|Great_Britain|  and the colonies became a crisis in 1774, Hanson became one of Frederick Countys leading  |Patriots|Patriot| . He chaired a town meeting that passed a resolution opposing the  |Boston_Port_Act|Boston_Port_Act| . In 1775, he was a delegate to the  |Maryland_Convention|Annapolis_Convention| , an extralegal body convened after the colonial assembly had been  |prorogued|Legislative_Sessionprocedure_In_Commonwealth_Realms| . With the other delegates, he signed the Association of Freemen on July 26, 1775, which expressed hope for reconciliation with Great Britain, but also called for military resistance to enforcement of the  |Coercive_Acts|Intolerable_Acts| .     With hostilities underway, Hanson chaired the Frederick County  |Committee_of_Observation|Committees_Of_Safety| , part of the Patriot organization that assumed control of local governance. Responsible for recruiting and arming soldiers, Hanson proved to be an excellent organizer, and Frederick County sent the first southern troops to join  |George_Washingtons|George_Washington|  army. Because funds were scarce, Hanson frequently paid soldiers and others with his own money. In June 1776, Hanson chaired the Frederick County meeting that urged provincial leaders in Annapolis to instruct Marylands delegates in the  |Continental_Congress|Continental_Congress|  to declare independence from Great Britain. While Congress worked on the  |Declaration_of_Independence|United_States_Declaration_Of_Independence| , Hanson was in Frederick County making gunlocks, storing powder, guarding prisoners, raising money and troops, dealing with Tories, and doing the myriad other tasks which went with being chairman of the committee of observation .     Hanson was elected to the newly reformed  |Maryland_House_of_Delegates|Maryland_House_Of_Delegates|  in 1777, the first of five annual terms. In December 1779, the House of Delegates named Hanson as a delegate to the  |Second_Continental_Congress|Second_Continental_Congress| ; he began serving in Congress in  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia|  in June 1780. Hanson came to Philadelphia with the reputation of having been the leading financier of the revolution in western Maryland, and soon he was a member of several committees dealing with finance.      When Hanson was elected to Congress, Maryland was holding up the ratification of the  |Articles_of_Confederation|Articles_Of_Confederation| . The state, which did not have any claims on western land, refused to ratify the Articles until the other states had ceded their western land claims. When the other states finally did so, the Maryland legislature decided in January 1781 to ratify the Articles. When Congress received notice of this, Hanson joined  |Daniel_Carroll|Daniel_Carroll|  in signing the Articles of Confederation on behalf of Maryland on March 1, 1781. With Marylands endorsement, the Articles officially went into effect. Many years later, some Hanson biographers claimed that Hanson had been instrumental in arranging the compromise and thus securing ratification of the Articles, but, according to historian Ralph Levering, there is no documentary evidence of Hansons opinions or actions in resolving the controversy.       On November 5, 1781, Congress elected Hanson as its president. Under the Articles of Confederation, the United States had no  |executive_branch|Executive_Branch| ; the president of Congress was a mostly ceremonial position, but the office did require Hanson to serve as neutral  |discussion_moderator|Discussion_Moderator| , handle official correspondence, and sign documents. Hanson found the work tedious and considered resigning after just one week, citing his poor health and family responsibilities. Colleagues urged him to remain because Congress at that moment lacked a  |quorum|Quorum|  to choose a successor. Out of a sense of duty, Hanson remained in office,  although his term as a delegate to Congress was nearly expired. The Maryland Assembly reelected him as a delegate on November 28, 1781, and so Hanson continued to serve as president until November 4, 1782.     The Articles of Confederation stipulated that presidents of Congress serve one-year terms, and Hanson became the first to do so.  Contrary to the claims of some of his later advocates, however, he was not the first president to serve under the Articles, nor the first to be elected under the Articles. When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, Congress did not bother to elect a new president; instead,  |Samuel_Huntington|Samuel_Huntington|  continued serving a term that had already exceeded a year. On July 9, 1781,  |Samuel_Johnston|Samuel_Johnston|  became the first man to be elected as president of Congress after the ratification of the Articles. He declined the office, however, perhaps to make himself available for North Carolinas gubernatorial election. After Johnston turned down the office,  |Thomas_McKean|Thomas_Mckean|  was elected. McKean served just a few months, resigning in October 1781 after hearing news of the British  |surrender_at_Yorktown|Siege_Of_Yorktown| . Congress asked him to remain in office until November, when a new session of Congress was scheduled to begin. It was in that session that Hanson began to serve his one-year term. A highlight of Hansons term was when George Washington presented  |Cornwalliss|Charles_Cornwallis_1St_Marquess_Cornwallis|  sword to Congress.       Hanson retired from public office after his one-year term as president of Congress. In poor health, he died on November 15, 1783, while visiting  |Oxon_Hill_Manor|Oxon_Hill_Manor|  in  |Prince_Georges_County_Maryland|Prince_Georges_County_Maryland| , the plantation of his nephew  |Thomas_Hawkins_Hanson|Thomas_Hawkins_Hanson| . He was buried there. Hanson owned at least 223 acres of land and 11 slaves at the time of his death.       About 1744, he married Jane Contee , daughter of Alexander Contee . Together, John and Jane had eight children, including:  who died in the  |battle_of_Fort_Washington|Battle_Of_Fort_Washington|  during the  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War| .    |Alexander_Contee_Hanson_Sr_|Alexander_Contee_Hanson_Sr_|  , who was a notable  |essayist|Essayist| . Alexander Hanson is sometimes confused with his son,  |Alexander_Contee_Hanson_Jr_|Alexander_Contee_Hanson|  , who became a newspaper editor and  |US_Senator|United_States_Senate| .          In 1898, Douglas H. Thomas, a descendant of Hanson, wrote a biography promoting Hanson as the first true  |President_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States| . Thomas became the driving force  behind the selection of Hanson as one of the two people who would represent Maryland in the  |National_Statuary_Hall_Collection|National_Statuary_Hall_Collection|  in Washington, D.C. Hanson was not initially on the shortlist for consideration, but he was chosen after lobbying by the  |Maryland_Historical_Society|Maryland_Historical_Society| . In 1903,  |bronze_statues_of_Hanson|John_Hanson|  and  |Charles_Carroll|Charles_Carroll_Of_Carrollton|  by sculptor  |Richard_E_Brooks|Richard_E_Brooks|  were added to Statuary Hall; Hansons is currently located on the 2nd floor of the Senate connecting corridor. Small versions of these two statues  sit on the presidents desk in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House.     Some historians have questioned the appropriateness of Hansons selection for the honor of representing Maryland in Statuary Hall. According to historian Gregory Stiverson, Hanson was not one of Marylands foremost leaders of the Revolutionary era. In 1975, historian Ralph Levering said that Hanson shouldnt have been one of the two Marylanders chosen, but he wrote that Hanson probably contributed as much as any other Marylander to the success of the American Revolution . In the 21st century, Maryland lawmakers have considered replacing Hansons statue in Statuary Hall with one of  |Harriet_Tubman|Harriet_Tubman| .      The idea that Hanson was the forgotten first president of the United States was further promoted in a 1932 biography of Hanson by journalist Seymour Wemyss Smith.  Smiths book asserted that the American Revolution had two primary leaders: George Washington on the battlefield, and John Hanson in politics. Smith, John Hanson, Our First President, 57. Smiths book, like Douglas H. Thomass 1898 book, was one of a number of biographies written seeking to promote Hanson as the first President of the United States . Regarding the opinion, historian Ralph Levering stated: Theyre not biographies by professional historians; they arent based on research into primary sources.  According to historian  |Richard_B_Morris|Richard_B_Morris| , if a president of Congress were to be called the first president of the United States, a stronger case could be made for  |Peyton_Randolph|Peyton_Randolph|  of Virginia, the first President of the first and second Continental Congresses, or for  |John_Hancock|John_Hancock| , the President of Congress when that body declared its independence.  The claim that Hanson was a forgotten president of the United States was revived on the Internet, sometimes with a new assertion that he was actually a black man; an anachronistic photograph of Senator  |John_Hanson|John_Hanson|  of Liberia has been used to support this claim.     In 1972, Hanson was depicted on a 6-cent US  |postal_card|Postal_Card| , which featured his name and portrait next to the word Patriot . Historian Irving Brant criticized the selection of Hanson for the card, arguing that it was a result of the old hoax promoting Hanson as the first president of the United States. In 1981, Hanson was featured on a 20-cent  |US_postage_stamp|List_Of_People_On_The_Postage_Stamps_Of_The_United_States| . U.S. Route 50 between Washington D.C. and Annapolis is named the  |John_Hanson_Highway|U_S_Route_50_In_Maryland|  in his honor. There are also middle schools located in  |Oxon_Hill_Maryland|Oxon_Hill_Maryland| , and  |Waldorf_Maryland|Waldorf_Maryland| , named after him. A former savings bank named for him was merged in the 1990s with Industrial Bank of Washington, D.C.     In the 1970s, a descendant of Hanson, John Hanson Briscoe, served as  |Speaker_of_the_Maryland_House_of_Delegates|Speaker_Of_The_Maryland_House_Of_Delegates| , which passed a measure establishing April 14 as John Hanson Day.  In 2009 the John Hanson Memorial Association was incorporated in Frederick, Maryland, to create the John Hanson National Memorial and to educate Americans about Hanson as well as to educate people about the many myths written about him. The Memorial includes a statue of President John Hanson and an interpretive setting in Frederick, Maryland, where Hanson lived between 1769 and his death in 1783. The Memorial is in the Frederick County Courthouses courtyard at the corner of Court and West Patrick Streets. Leaders of the Memorial include President Peter Hanson Michael, Vice President Robert Hanson, and Director John C. Hanson. John Hanson Briscoe was also a director until his death in 2014.
