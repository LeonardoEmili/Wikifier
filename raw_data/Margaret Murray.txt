               Margaret Alice Murray was an  |Anglo_Indian|Anglo_Indian| |_Egyptologist|Egyptology| ,  |archaeologist|Archaeology| ,  |anthropologist|Anthropology| ,  |historian|History| , and  |folklorist|Folkloristics| . The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at  |University_College_London|University_College_London|  from 1898 to 1935. She served as President of the  |Folklore_Society|Folklore_Society|  from 1953 to 1955, and published widely over the course of her career.     Born to a wealthy middle-class English family in  |Calcutta|Kolkata| ,  |British_India|British_India| , Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head  |Flinders_Petrie|Flinders_Petrie| , who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902–03 she took part in Petries  |excavations|Excavation|  at  |Abydos_Egypt|Abydos_Egypt| , there discovering the  |Osireion|Osireion|  temple and the following season investigated the  |Saqqara|Saqqara|  cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the  |British_Museum|British_Museum|  and  |Manchester_Museum|Manchester_Museum| , it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the  |mummies|Mummy|  recovered from the  |Tomb_of_the_Two_Brothers|Tomb_Of_Two_Brothers|   – the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British  |Egyptomania|Egyptomania|  reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| , Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.     Murray also became closely involved in the  |first_wave_feminist|First_Wave_Feminism|  movement, joining the  |Womens_Social_and_Political_Union|Womens_Social_And_Political_Union|  and devoting much time to improving womens status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| , she focused her research on the  |witch_cult_hypothesis|Witch_Cult_Hypothesis| , the theory that the  |witch_trials_of_Early_Modern_Christendom|Witch_Trials_In_The_Early_Modern_Period|  were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian,  |pagan|Paganism|  religion devoted to a  |Horned_God|Horned_God| . Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging  |new_religious_movement|New_Religious_Movement|  of  |Wicca|Wicca| . From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on  |Malta|Malta|  and  |Menorca|Menorca|  and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed Assistant Professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petries excavation of  |Tall_al_Ajjul|Tall_Al_Ajjul|  and in 1937 she led a small excavation at  |Petra|Petra|  in Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the  |University_of_Cambridge|University_Of_Cambridge|  and  |City_Literary_Institute|City_Literary_Institute| , and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.     Murrays work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the moniker of The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology , although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie. Conversely, Murrays work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised. The influence of her witch-cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by various scholars, and she herself has been dubbed the Grandmother of Wicca .         Margaret Murray was born on 13 July 1863 in  |Calcutta|Kolkata| ,  |Bengal_Presidency|Bengal_Presidency| , then a major military city in  |British_India|British_Raj| . A member of the  |wealthy_British_imperial_elite|Anglo_Indian| , she lived in the city with her family: parents James and Margaret Murray, an older sister named Mary, and her paternal grandmother and great-grandmother. James Murray, born in India of English descent, was a businessman and manager of the  |Serampore|Serampore|  paper mills who was thrice elected President of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce. His wife, Margaret , had moved to India from Britain in 1857 to work as a  |missionary|Missionary| , preaching  |Christianity|Christianity|  and educating Indian women. She continued with this work after marrying James and giving birth to her two daughters.   Although most of their lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the indigenous sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her familys employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to  |Mussoorie|Mussoorie| . The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murrays Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in the fact that she had never had to sit an exam before entering university.     In 1870, Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in  |Lambourn|Lambourn| ,  |Berkshire|Berkshire| . Although John provided them with a strongly Christian education and a belief in  |the_inferiority_of_women|Misogyny| , both of which she would reject, he awakened Murrays interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments. In 1873, the girls mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to  |Bonn|Bonn|  in Germany, where they both became fluent in  |German|German_Language| . In 1875 they returned to Calcutta, staying there till 1877. They then moved with their parents back to England, where they settled in  |Sydenham|Sydenham_London| ,  |South_London|South_London| . There, they spent much time visiting  |The_Crystal_Palace|The_Crystal_Palace| , while their father worked at his firms London office. In 1880, they returned to Calcutta, where Margaret remained for the next seven years. She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was involved with the hospitals attempts to deal with a  |cholera_outbreak|1881–96_Cholera_Pandemic| . In 1887, she returned to England, moving to  |Rugby|Rugby_Warwickshire| ,  |Warwickshire|Warwickshire| , where her uncle John had moved, now widowed. Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people. When her father retired and moved to England, she moved into his house in  |Bushey_Heath|Bushey| ,  |Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire| , living with him until his death in 1891. In 1893 she then travelled to  |Madras|Chennai| ,  |Tamil_Nadu|Tamil_Nadu| , where her sister had moved to with her new husband.          Encouraged by her mother and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened department of Egyptology at  |University_College_London|University_College_London|  in  |Bloomsbury|Bloomsbury| ,  |Central_London|Central_London| . Having been founded by an endowment from  |Amelia_Blanford_Edwards|Amelia_Blanford_Edwards| , one of the co-founders of the  |Egypt_Exploration_Fund|Egypt_Exploration_Society|  , the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist  |Sir_William_Flinders_Petrie|Flinders_Petrie| , and based in the Edwards Library of  |UCLs_South_Cloisters|Ucl_Main_Building| . Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, as part of a class composed largely of other women and older men. There, she took courses in the  |Ancient_Egyptian|Egyptian_Language|  and  |Coptic|Coptic_Language|  languages which were taught by  |Francis_Llewellyn_Griffith|Francis_Llewellyn_Griffith|  and  |Walter_Ewing_Crum|Walter_Ewing_Crum|  respectively.     Murray soon got to know Petrie, becoming his copyist and illustrator and producing the drawings for the published report on his excavations at  |Qift|Qift| , Koptos. In turn, he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper, The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History , which was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology in 1895. Becoming Petries de facto though unofficial assistant, Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffiths absence. In 1898 she was appointed to the position of Junior Lecturer, responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department; this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom. In this capacity, she spent two days a week at UCL, devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother. As time went on, she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history, religion, and language. Among Murrays students  – to whom she referred as the Gang  – were several who went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology, including  |Reginald_Engelbach|Reginald_Engelbach| ,  |Georgina_Aitken|Georgina_Aitken| ,  |Guy_Brunton|Guy_Brunton| , and  |Myrtle_Broome|Myrtle_Broome| . She supplemented her UCL salary by teaching evening classes in Egyptology at the  |British_Museum|British_Museum| .          At this point, Murray had no experience in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petries excavations at  |Abydos|Abydos_Egypt| . Petrie and his wife,  |Hilda_Petrie|Hilda_Petrie| , had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar  |Émile_Amélineau|Émile_Amélineau| . Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues with some of the male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the  |Osireion|Osireion| , a temple devoted to the god  |Osiris|Osiris|  which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh  |Seti_I|Seti_I|  during the period of the  |New_Kingdom|New_Kingdom| . She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.     During the 1903–04 field season, Murray returned to Egypt, and at Petries instruction began her investigations at the  |Saqqara|Saqqara|  cemetery near to  |Cairo|Cairo| , which dated from the period of the  |Old_Kingdom|Old_Kingdom| . Murray did not have legal permission to excavate the site, and instead spent her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated during the 1860s by  |Auguste_Mariette|Auguste_Mariette| . She published her findings in 1905 as Saqqara Mastabas I, although would not publish translations of the inscriptions until 1937 as Saqqara Mastabas II. Both The Osireion at Abydos and Saqqara Mastabas I proved to be very influential in the Egyptological community, with Petrie recognising Murrays contribution to his own career.          On returning to London, Murray took an active role in the feminist movement, volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations, protests, and marches. Joining the  |Womens_Social_and_Political_Union|Womens_Social_And_Political_Union| , she was present at large marches like the  |Mud_March|Mud_March|  of 1907 and the  |Womens_Coronation_Procession|Womens_Coronation_Procession|  of June 1911. She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia. Murray also pushed the  |professional_boundaries|Professional_Boundaries|  for women throughout her own career, and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia. As women could not use the mens common room, she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women, and later ensured that a larger, better-equipped room was converted for the purpose; it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room. At UCL, she became a friend of fellow female lecturer  |Winifred_Smith|Winifred_Smith| , and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university, with Murray becoming particularly annoyed at female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands. Feeling that students should get nutritious yet affordable lunches, for many years she sat on the UCL Refectory Committee.     Various museums around the United Kingdom invited Murray to advise them on their Egyptological collections, resulting in her cataloguing the Egyptian artefacts owned by the  |Dublin_National_Museum|National_Museum_Of_Ireland_–_Archaeology| , the  |National_Museum_of_Antiquities|National_Museum_Of_Antiquities|  in  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| , and the  |Society_of_Antiquaries_of_Scotland|Society_Of_Antiquaries_Of_Scotland| , being elected a Fellow of the latter in thanks.   Petrie had established connections with the Egyptological wing of  |Manchester_Museum|Manchester_Museum|  in  |Manchester|Manchester| , and it was there that many of his finds had been housed. Murray thus often travelled to the museum to catalogue these artefacts, and during the 1906–07 school year regularly lectured there. In 1907, Petrie excavated the  |Tomb_of_the_Two_Brothers|Tomb_Of_Two_Brothers| , a Middle Kingdom burial of two Egyptian priests, Nakht-ankh and Khnum-nakht, and it was decided that Murray would carry out the public unwrapping of the latters mummified body. Taking place at the museum in May 1908, it represented the first time that a woman had led a public mummy unwrapping and was attended by over 500 onlookers, attracting press attention. Murray was particularly keen to emphasise the importance that the unwrapping would have for the scholarly understanding of the Middle Kingdom and its burial practices, and lashed out against members of the public who saw it as immoral; she declared that every vestige of ancient remains must be carefully studied and recorded without sentimentality and without fear of the outcry of the ignorant . She subsequently published a book about her analysis of the two bodies, The Tomb of the Two Brothers, which remained a key publication on Middle Kingdom mummification practices into the 21st century.        Murray was dedicated to public education, hoping to infuse  |Egyptomania|Egyptomania|  with solid scholarship about Ancient Egypt, and to this end authored a series of books aimed at a general audience. In 1905 she published Elementary Egyptian Grammar which was followed in 1911 by Elementary Coptic Grammar. In 1913, she published Ancient Egyptian Legends for  |John_Murrays|John_Murray|  The Wisdom of the East series. She was particularly pleased with the increased public interest in Egyptology that followed  |Howard_Carters|Howard_Carter|  discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh  |Tutankhamun|Tutankhamun|  in 1922. From at least 1911 until his death in 1940, Murray was a close friend of the anthropologist  |Charles_Gabriel_Seligman|Charles_Gabriel_Seligman|  of the  |London_School_of_Economics|London_School_Of_Economics| , and together they co-authored a variety of papers on Egyptology that were aimed at an anthropological audience. Many of these dealt with subjects that Egyptological journals would not publish, such as the Sa sign for the  |uterus|Uterus| , and thus were published in  Man , the journal of the  |Royal_Anthropological_Institute|Royal_Anthropological_Institute| . It was at Seligmans recommendation that she was invited to become a member of the Institute in 1916.     In 1914, Petrie launched the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published through his own  |British_School_of_Archaeology_in_Egypt|British_School_Of_Archaeology_In_Egypt|  , which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time. She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.     The outbreak of the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  in 1914, in which the United Kingdom went to war against Germany and the Ottoman Empire, meant that Petrie and other staff members were unable to return to Egypt for excavation. Instead, Petrie and Murray spent much of the time reorganising the artefact collections that they had attained over the past decades. To aid Britains war effort, Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Air Detachment of the College Womens Union Society, and for several weeks was posted to  |Saint_Malo|Saint_Malo|  in France. After being taken ill herself, she was sent to recuperate in  |Glastonbury|Glastonbury| ,  |Somerset|Somerset| , where she became interested in  |Glastonbury_Abbey|Glastonbury_Abbey|  and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of  |King_Arthur|King_Arthur|  and to the idea that the  |Holy_Grail|Holy_Grail|  had been brought there by  |Joseph_of_Aramathea|Joseph_Of_Aramathea| . Pursuing this interest, she published the paper Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance in the journal Ancient Egypt, although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence by the likes of  |Jessie_Weston|Jessie_Weston| .                Murrays interest in folklore led her to develop an interest in the witch trials of Early Modern Europe. In 1917, she published a paper in Folklore, the journal of the  |Folklore_Society|Folklore_Society| , in which she first articulated her version of the witch-cult theory, arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of a definite religion with beliefs, ritual, and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end . She followed this up with papers on the subject in the journals Man and the  Scottish Historical Review . She articulated these views more fully in her 1921 book  The Witch-Cult in Western Europe , published by Oxford University Press after receiving a positive peer review by  |Henry_Balfour|Henry_Balfour| , and which received both criticism and support on publication. Many reviews in academic journals were critical, with historians claiming that she had distorted and misinterpreted the contemporary records that she was using, but the book was nevertheless influential.        As a result of her work in this area, she was invited to provide the entry on witchcraft for the fourteenth edition of the  Encyclopædia Britannica  in 1929. She used the opportunity to propagate her own witch-cult theory, failing to mention the alternate theories proposed by other academics. Her entry would be included in the encyclopedia until 1969, becoming readily accessible to the public, and it was for this reason that her ideas on the subject had such a significant impact. It received a particularly enthusiastic reception by  |occultists|Occultism|  such as  |Dion_Fortune|Dion_Fortune| ,  |Lewis_Spence|Lewis_Spence| ,  |Ralph_Shirley|Ralph_Shirley| , and  |J_W_Brodie_Innes|J_W_Brodie_Innes| , perhaps because its claims regarding an ancient secret society chimed with similar claims common among various occult groups. Murray joined the Folklore Society in February 1927, and was elected to the societys council a month later, although she stood down in 1929. Murray reiterated her witch-cult theory in her 1933 book, The God of the Witches, which was aimed at a wider, non-academic audience. In this book, she cut out or toned down what she saw as the more unpleasant aspects of the witch-cult, such as  |animal|Animal_Sacrifice|  and  |child|Child_Sacrifice|  sacrifice, and began describing the religion in more positive terms as the Old Religion .     From 1921 to 1927, Murray led archaeological excavations on Malta, assisted by Edith Guest and  |Gertrude_Caton_Thompson|Gertrude_Caton_Thompson| . She excavated the Bronze Age  |megalithic|Megalithic|  monuments of  |Santa_Sofia|Santa_Sofia| ,  |Santa_Maria_tal_Bakkari|Santa_Maria_Tal_Bakkari| ,  |Għar_Dalam|Għar_Dalam| , and  |Borġ_in_Nadur|Borġ_In_Nadur| , all of which were threatened by the construction of a new aerodrome. In this she was funded by the  |Percy_Sladen_Memorial_Fund|Percy_Sladen_Memorial_Trust| . Her resulting three-volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology. During the excavations, she had taken an interest in the islands folklore, resulting in the 1932 publication of her book Maltese Folktales, much of which was a translation of earlier stories collected by Father Magri and her friend Liza Galea. In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in  |Malta_Museum|National_Museum_Of_Archaeology_Malta| , resulting in another publication, Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta.          On the basis of her work in Malta,  |Louis_C_G_Clarke|L_C_G_Clarke| , the curator of the  |Cambridge_Museum_of_Ethnology_and_Anthropology|Museum_Of_Archaeology_And_Anthropology_University_Of_Cambridge| , invited her to lead excavations on the island of  |Menorca|Menorca|  from 1930 to 1931. With the aid of Guest, she excavated the  |talaiotic|Talaiotic_Culture|  sites of  |Trepucó|Trepucó|  and  |Sa_Torreta_de_Tramuntana|Sa_Torreta_De_Tramuntana| , resulting in the publication of Cambridge Excavations in Minorca. Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as Egyptian Sculpture and Egyptian Temples , which received largely positive reviews. In the summer of 1925 she led a team of volunteers to excavate Homestead Moat in  |Whomerle_Wood|Whomerle_Wood|  near to  |Stevenage|Stevenage| ,  |Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire| ; she did not publish an excavation report and did not mention the event in her autobiography, with her motives for carrying out the excavation remaining unclear.     In 1924, UCL promoted Murray to the position of assistant professor, and in 1927 she was awarded an  |honorary_doctorate|Honorary_Doctorate|  for her career in Egyptology. That year, Murray was tasked with guiding  |Mary_of_Teck|Mary_Of_Teck| , the Queen consort, around the Egyptology department during the latters visit to UCL. The pressures of teaching had eased by this point, allowing Murray to spend more time travelling internationally; in 1920 she returned to Egypt and in 1929 visited South Africa, where she attended the meeting of the  |British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science|British_Association_For_The_Advancement_Of_Science| , whose theme was the prehistory of southern Africa. In the early 1930s she travelled to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , where she visited museums in  |Leningrad|Leningrad| ,  |Moscow|Moscow| ,  |Kharkiv|Kharkiv| , and  |Kiev|Kiev| , and then in late 1935 she undertook a lecture tour of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia.   Although having reached legal retirement age in 1927, and thus unable to be offered another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed on an annual basis each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  in  |Mandatory_Palestine|Mandatory_Palestine|  with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murrays retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at  |Tall_al_Ajjul|Tall_Al_Ajjul| , a Bronze Age mound south of  |Gaza|Gaza_City| .          During Murrays 1935 trip to Palestine, she had taken the opportunity to visit  |Petra|Petra|  in neighbouring Jordan. Intrigued by the site, in March and April 1937 she returned in order to carry out a small excavation in several cave dwellings at the site, subsequently writing both an excavation report and a guidebook on Petra. Back in England, from 1934 to 1940, Murray aided the cataloguing of Egyptian antiquities at  |Girton_College_Cambridge|Girton_College_Cambridge| , and also gave lectures in Egyptology at the university until 1942.   During the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , Murray evaded  |the_Blitz|The_Blitz|  of London by moving to Cambridge, where she volunteered for a group  who educated military personnel to prepare them for post-war life. Based in the city, she embarked on research into the towns Early Modern history, examining documents stored in local parish churches,  |Downing_College|Downing_College| , and  |Ely_Cathedral|Ely_Cathedral| ; she never published her findings. In 1945, she briefly became involved in the  Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?  murder case.      After the war ended she returned to London, settling into a  |bedsit|Bedsit|  room in Endsleigh Street, which was close to University College London and the  |Institute_of_Archaeology|Ucl_Institute_Of_Archaeology|  ; she continued her involvement with the former and made use of the latters library. On most days she visited the British Museum in order to consult their library, and twice a week she taught adult education classes on Ancient Egyptian history and religion at the  |City_Literary_Institute|City_Literary_Institute| ; upon her retirement from this position she nominated her former pupil,  |Veronica_Seton_Williams|Veronica_Seton_Williams| , to replace her.     Murrays interest in popularising Egyptology among the wider public continued; in 1949 she published Ancient Egyptian Religious Poetry, her second work for John Murrays The Wisdom of the East series. That same year she also published The Splendour That Was Egypt, in which she collated many of her UCL lectures. The book adopted a  |diffusionist_perspective|Trans_Cultural_Diffusion|  that argued that Egypt influenced Greco-Roman society and thus modern Western society. This was seen as a compromise between Petries belief that other societies influenced the emergence of Egyptian civilisation and  |Grafton_Elliot_Smiths|Grafton_Elliot_Smith|  highly unorthodox and heavily criticised  |hyperdiffusionist|Hyperdiffusionism_In_Archaeology|  view that Egypt was the source of all global civilisation. The book received a mixed reception from the archaeological community.          In 1953, Murray was appointed to the presidency of the Folklore Society following the resignation of former president Allan Gomme. The Society had initially approached  |John_Mavrogordato|John_Mavrogordato|  for the post, but he had declined, with Murray accepting the nomination several months later. Murray remained President for two terms, until 1955. In her 1954 presidential address, England as a Field for Folklore Research , she lamented what she saw as the English peoples disinterest in their own folklore in favour of that from other nations. For the autumn 1961 issue of Folklore, the society published a  festschrift  to Murray to commemorate her 98th birthday. The issue contained contributions from various scholars paying tribute to her – with papers dealing with archaeology, fairies, Near Eastern religious symbols, Greek folk songs – but notably not about witchcraft, potentially because no other folklorists were willing to defend her witch-cult theory.     In May 1957, Murray had championed the archaeologist  |T_C_Lethbridges|T_C_Lethbridge|  controversial claims that he had discovered three pre-Christian chalk  |hill_figures|Hill_Figure|  on  |Wandlebury_Hill|Wandlebury_Hill|  in the  |Gog_Magog_Hills|Gog_Magog_Hills| , Cambridgeshire. Privately she expressed concern about the reality of the figures. Lethbridge subsequently authored a book championing her witch-cult theory in which he sought the cults origins in pre-Christian culture. In 1960, she donated her collection of papers  – including correspondences with a wide range of individuals across the country  – to the Folklore Society Archive, where it is now known as the Murray Collection .     Crippled with  |arthritis|Arthritis| , Murray had moved into a home in  |North_Finchley|North_Finchley| , north London, where she was cared for by a retired couple who were trained nurses; from here she occasionally took taxis into central London to visit the UCL library.   Amid failing health, in 1962 Murray moved into the  |Queen_Victoria_Memorial_Hospital|Queen_Victoria_Memorial_Hospital|  in  |Welwyn|Welwyn| ,  |Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire| , where she could receive 24-hour care; she lived here for the final 18 months of her life. To mark her hundredth birthday, on 13 July 1963 a group of her friends, former students, and doctors gathered for a party at nearby  |Ayot_St_Lawrence|Ayot_St_Lawrence| . Two days later, her doctor drove her to UCL for a second birthday party, again attended by many of her friends, colleagues, and former students; it was the last time that she visited the university. In Man, the journal of the  |Royal_Anthropological_Institute|Royal_Anthropological_Institute| , it was noted that Murray was the only Fellow of the Institute to within living memory, if not in its whole history . That year she published two books; one was The Genesis of Religion, in which she argued that humanitys first deities had been goddesses rather than male gods. The second was her autobiography, My First Hundred Years, which received predominantly positive reviews. She died on 13 November 1963, and her body was cremated.          The later folklorists Caroline Oates and Juliette Wood have suggested that Murray was best known for her witch-cult theory, with biographer Margaret S. Drower expressing the view that it was her work on this subject which perhaps more than any other, made her known to the general public . It has been claimed that Murrays was the first feminist study of the witch trials , as well as being the first to have actually empowered the witches by giving the accused both  |free_will|Free_Will|  and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators. The theory was faulty, in part because all of her academic training was in Egyptology, with no background knowledge in European history, but also because she exhibited a tendency to generalize wildly on the basis of very slender evidence . Oates and Wood, however, noted that Murrays interpretations of the evidence fitted within wider perspectives on the past that existed at the time, stating that Murray was far from isolated in her method of reading ancient ritual origins into later myths . In particular, her approach was influenced by the work of the anthropologist  |James_Frazer|James_Frazer| , who had argued for the existence of a pervasive  |dying_and_resurrecting_god_myth|Dying_And_Rising_God| , and she was also influenced by the interpretative approaches of E. O. James,  |Karl_Pearson|Karl_Pearson| ,  |Herbert_Fleure|Herbert_Fleure| , and  |Harold_Peake|Harold_Peake| .            In The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and  |New_England|New_England| . She drew a division between what she termed Operative Witchcraft , which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose, and Ritual Witchcraft , by which she meant the ancient religion of Western Europe , a fertility-based faith that she also termed the Dianic cult . She claimed that the cult had very probably once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a Mother Goddess but that at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female . In her argument, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches god, manifest and incarnate , to whom the witches offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches Sabbaths.     Members joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called admission ceremonies ; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptised into the faith. At the same time, she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines. Murray described the religion as being divided into  |covens|Coven|  containing thirteen members, led by a coven officer who was often termed the Devil in the trial accounts, but who was accountable to a Grand Master . According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book, with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors.     Describing this witch-cult as a joyous religion , she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter. She asserted that the General Meeting of all members of the religion were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats. The Esbats, Murray claimed, were nocturnal rites that began at midnight, and were primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious . At the former, magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends. She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches paying homage to the deity, renewing their vows of fidelity and obedience to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they had conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted, ceremonies and fertility rites took place, and then the Sabbath ended with feasting and dancing.        Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be a fertility cult , she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood; the sacrifice of animals; the sacrifice of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers; and the sacrifice of the witches god by fire to ensure fertility.   She interpreted accounts of witches shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred. She asserted that accounts of  |familiars|Familiar|  were based on the witches use of animals, which she divided into divining familiars used in  |divination|Divination|  and domestic familiars used in other magic rites.     Murray asserted that a pre-Christian fertility-based religion had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community . She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarfs, who continued to live on the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two. In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that  |Joan_of_Arc|Joan_Of_Arc|  and  |Gilles_de_Rais|Gilles_De_Rais|  were members of the witch-cult and were executed for it, a claim which has been refuted by historians, especially in the case of Joan of Arc.     The later historian  |Ronald_Hutton|Ronald_Hutton|  commented that The Witch-Cult in Western Europe rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th-century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology . He also noted that the books tone was generally dry and clinical, and every assertion was meticulously footnoted to a source, with lavish quotation . It was not a bestseller; in its first thirty years, only 2,020 copies were sold. However, it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject; in 1929, she was invited to provide the entry on Witchcraft for the  Encyclopædia Britannica , and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship. It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1969.     Murray followed The Witch-Cult in Western Europe with The God of the Witches, published by the popular press  |Sampson_Low|Sampson_Low|  in 1931; although similar in content, unlike her previous volume it was aimed at a mass market audience. The tone of the book also differed strongly from its predecessor, containing emotionally inflated and coloured with religious phraseology and repeatedly referring to the witch-cult as the Old Religion . In this book she also cut out or toned down many of the claims made in her previous volume which would have painted the cult in a bad light, such as those which discussed sex and the sacrifice of animals and children.     In this book she began to refer to the witches deity as the  |Horned_God|Horned_God| , and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the  |Palaeolithic|Palaeolithic| .   She further asserted that in the Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at  |Mohenjo_Daro|Mohenjo_Daro| , which are often interpreted as depictions of  |Pashupati|Pashupati| , as well as the deities  |Osiris|Osiris|  and  |Amon|Amun|  in Egypt and the  |Minotaur|Minotaur|  of  |Minoan_Crete|Minoan_Crete| . Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by  |Pan|Pan|  in Greece,  |Cernunnos|Cernunnos|  in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the  |Dorset_Ooser|Dorset_Ooser|  and the  |Puck_Fair|Puck_Fair|  as evidence of his veneration.     In 1954, she published The Divine King in England, in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking influence from Frazers  The Golden Bough , an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of  |William_II|William_Ii_Of_England|  was really a ritual sacrifice.   No academic took the book seriously, and it was ignored by many of her supporters.         Upon initial publication, Murrays thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including some significant scholars, albeit none who were experts in the witch trials. Historians of Early Modern Britain like  |George_Norman_Clark|George_Norman_Clark|  and  |Christopher_Hill|Christopher_Hill|  incorporated her theories into their work, although the latter subsequently distanced himself from the theory. For the 1961 reprint of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, the Medieval historian  |Steven_Runciman|Steven_Runciman|  provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murrays minor details may be open to criticism , but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by  |Arno_Runeberg|Arno_Runeberg|  in his 1947 book Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic as well as  |Pennethorne_Hughes|Pennethorne_Hughes|  in his 1952 book Witches. As a result, the Canadian historian Elliot Rose, writing in 1962, claimed that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels , being widely accepted among educated people .     Rose suggested that the reason that Murrays theory gained such support was partly because of her imposing credentials as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or  |_Robert_Graves|Robert_Graves|  would be familiar with . Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theorys popularity was because it appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age , including the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets , the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, the folklorist  |Jacqueline_Simpson|Jacqueline_Simpson|  suggested that part of the Murrayite theorys appeal was that it appeared to give a sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like  |Montague_Summers|Montague_Summers| , who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. How refreshing , noted the historian  |Hilda_Ellis_Davidson|Hilda_Ellis_Davidson| , and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one.             Murrays theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials, and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her factual errors and methodological failings . Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced during the 1920s and 1930s were largely critical. George L. Burr reviewed both of her initial books on the witch-cult for the  American Historical Review . He stated that she was not acquainted with the careful general histories by modern scholars and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts. W. R. Halliday was highly critical in his review for Folklore, as was E. M. Loeb in his review for  American Anthropologist .     Soon after, one of the foremost specialists of the trial records, LEstrange Ewen, brought out a series of books which rejected Murrays interpretation.   Rose suggested that Murrays books on the witch-cult contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning . He accepted that her case could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it . Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murrays claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as a view grounded on ignorance alone .     Murray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting out of their own Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.   Simpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British  |folkloristics|Folkloristics|  Murrays theories were permitted to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic . As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in Folklore between Murrays in 1917 and  |Rossell_Hope_Robbins|Rossell_Hope_Robbins|  in 1963. She also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like  |Theo_Brown|Theo_Brown| ,  |Ruth_Tongue|Ruth_Tongue| , or  |Enid_Porter|Enid_Porter| , none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, thus evidencing her claim that Murrays theories were widely ignored by scholars of folkloristics.       Murrays work was increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. During these decades, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America  – such as  |Alan_Macfarlane|Alan_Macfarlane| , Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo  – published in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.   In 1971, the English historian  |Keith_Thomas|Keith_Thomas|  stated that on the basis of this research, there was very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult . He stated that Murrays conclusions were almost totally groundless because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point.     In 1975, the historian  |Norman_Cohn|Norman_Cohn|  commented that Murrays knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of  |historical_method|Historical_Method|  was non-existent , adding that her ideas were firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould . That same year, the historian of religion  |Mircea_Eliade|Mircea_Eliade|  described Murrays work as hopelessly inadequate , containing numberless and appalling errors . In 1996, the feminist historian  |Diane_Purkiss|Diane_Purkiss|  stated that although Murrays thesis was intrinsically improbable and commanded little or no allegiance within the modern academy , she felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had unfairly adopted an androcentric approach by which they contrasted their own, male and methodologically sound interpretation against Murrays feminised belief about the witch-cult.          Hutton stated that Murray had treated her source material with reckless abandon , in that she had taken vivid details of alleged witch practices from sources scattered across a great extent of space and time and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves. Concurring with this assessment, the historian  |Jeffrey_Burton_Russell|Jeffrey_Burton_Russell| , writing with the independent author Brooks Alexander, stated that Murrays use of sources, in general, is appalling . The pair went on to claim that today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong  – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises .     The Italian historian  |Carlo_Ginzburg|Carlo_Ginzburg|  has been cited as being willing to give some slight support to Murrays theory. Ginzburg stated that although her thesis had been formulated in a wholly uncritical way and contained serious defects , it did contain a kernel of truth . He stated his opinion that she was right in claiming that European witchcraft had roots in an ancient fertility cult , something that he argued was vindicated by his work researching the  benandanti , an agrarian visionary tradition recorded in the  |Friuli|Friuli|  district of Northeastern Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several historians and folklorists have pointed out that Ginzburgs arguments are very different to Murrays: whereas Murray argued for the existence of a pre-Christian witches cult whose members physically met during the witches Sabbaths, Ginzburg argued that some of the European visionary traditions that were conflated with witchcraft in the Early Modern period had their origins in pre-Christian fertility religions. Moreover, other historians have expressed criticism of Ginzburgs interpretation of the benandanti; Cohn stated that there was nothing whatsoever in the source material to justify the idea that the benandanti were the survival of an age-old fertility cult . Echoing these views, Hutton commented that Ginzburgs claim that the benandanti visionary traditions were a survival from pre-Christian practices was an idea resting on imperfect material and conceptual foundations . He added that Ginzburgs assumption that what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies dating to pagan times , was entirely an inference of his own and not one supported by the documentary evidence.            On researching the history of UCLs Egyptology department, the historian Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt.  Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist  |Ralph_Merrifield|Ralph_Merrifield| , who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age . Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, and then in the middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument . The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society remember her fondly , adding that Murray had been especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas .     One of Murrays friends in the Society,  |E_O_James|E_O_James| , described her as a mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge without reserve, or, be it said, much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts!  Davidson described her as being not at all assertive  ... never thrust her ideas on anyone. she behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect, or perhaps, of the  |Freemasons|Freemasonry| , but never on any account got into arguments about it in public.  The archaeologist  |Glyn_Daniel|Glyn_Daniel|  observed that Murray remained mentally alert into her old age, commenting that her vigour and forthrightness and ruthless energy never deserted her .     Murray never married, instead devoting her life to her work, and for this reason, Hutton drew comparisons between her and two other prominent female British scholars of the period,  |Jane_Harrison|Jane_Ellen_Harrison|  and  |Jessie_Weston|Jessie_Weston| . Murrays biographer Kathleen L. Sheppard stated that she was deeply committed to public outreach, particularly when it came to Egyptology, and that as such she wanted to change the means by which the public obtained knowledge about Egypts history: she wished to throw open the doors to the scientific laboratory and invite the public in . She considered travel to be one of her favourite activities, although due to restraints on her time and finances she was unable to do this regularly; her salary remained small and the revenue from her books was meagre.     Raised a devout Christian by her mother, Murray had initially become a  |Sunday_School|Sunday_School|  teacher to preach the faith, but after entering the academic profession she rejected religion, gaining a reputation among other members of the Folklore Society as a noted  |sceptic|Scepticism|  and a  |rationalist|Rationalism| . She was openly critical of organised religion, although continued to maintain a personal belief in a  |God|God|  of some sort, relating in her autobiography that she believed in an unseen over-ruling Power , which science calls Nature and religion calls God .   She was also a believer and a practitioner of  |magic|Magic| , performing  |curses|Curse|  against those she felt deserved it; in one case she cursed a fellow academic,  |Jaroslav_Černý|Jaroslav_Černý| , when she felt that his promotion to the position of Professor of Egyptology over her friend  |Walter_Bryan_Emery|Walter_Bryan_Emery|  was unworthy. Her curse entailed mixing up ingredients in a frying pan, and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues. In another instance, she was claimed to have created a wax image of  |Kaiser_Wilhelm_II|Kaiser_Wilhelm_Ii|  and then melted it during the First World War.           Hutton noted that Murray was one of the earliest women to make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship , and the archaeologist Niall Finneran described her as one of the greatest characters of post-war British archaeology . Upon her death, Daniel referred to her as the Grand Old Woman of Egyptology , with Hutton noting that Egyptology represented the core of her academic career . In 2014, Thornton referred to her as one of Britains most famous Egyptologists . However, according to the archaeologist Ruth Whitehouse, Murrays contributions to archaeology and Egyptology were often overlooked as her work was overshadowed by that of Petrie, to the extent that she was often thought of primarily as one of Petries assistants rather than as a scholar in her own right. By her retirement she had come to be highly regarded within the discipline, although, according to Whitehouse, Murrays reputation declined following her death, something that Whitehouse attributed to the rejection of her witch-cult theory and the general erasure of women archaeologists from the disciplines male-dominated history.          In his obituary for Murray in Folklore, James noted that her death was an event of unusual interest and importance in the annals of the Folk-Lore Society in particular as well as in the wider sphere in which her influence was felt in so many directions and   disciplines . However, later academic folklorists, such as Simpson and Wood, have cited Murray and her witch-cult theory as an embarrassment to their field, and to the Folklore Society specifically. Simpson suggested that Murrays position as President of the Society was a causal factor in the mistrustful attitude that many historians held toward folkloristics as an academic discipline, as they erroneously came to believe that all folklorists endorsed Murrays ideas. Similarly, Catherine Noble stated that Murray caused considerable damage to the study of witchcraft .     In 1935, UCL introduced the Margaret Murray Prize, awarded to the student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology; it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century. In 1969, UCL named one of their common rooms in her honour, but it was converted into an office in 1989. In June 1983,  |Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother|Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother|  visited the room and there was gifted a copy of Murrays My First Hundred Years. UCL also hold two busts of Murray, one kept in the  |Petrie_Museum|Petrie_Museum|  and the other in the library of the UCL Institute of Archaeology. This sculpture was commissioned by one of her students,  |Violet_MacDermot|Violet_Macdermot| , and produced by the artist  |Stephen_Rickard|Stephen_Rickard| . UCL also possess a watercolour painting of Murray by  |Winifred_Brunton|Winifred_Brunton| ; formerly exhibited in the Petrie Gallery, it was later placed into the Art Collection stores.   In 2013, on the 150th anniversary of Murrays birth and the 50th of her death, the UCL Institute of Archaeologys Ruth Whitehouse described Murray as a remarkable woman whose life was well worth celebrating, both in the archaeological world at large and especially in UCL .     The historian of archaeology Rosalind M. Janssen titled her study of Egyptology at UCL The First Hundred Years as a tribute to Murray. Murrays friend  |Margaret_Stefana_Drower|Margaret_Stefana_Drower|  authored a short biography of her, which was included as a chapter in the 2004 edited volume on Breaking Ground: Pioneering Women Archaeologists. In 2013,  |Lexington_Books|Lexington_Books|  published The Life of Margaret Alice Murray: A Womans Work in Archaeology, a biography of Murray authored by Kathleen L. Sheppard, then an assistant professor at  |Missouri_University_of_Science_and_Technology|Missouri_University_Of_Science_And_Technology| ; the book was based upon Sheppards doctoral dissertation produced at the  |University_of_Oklahoma|University_Of_Oklahoma| . Although characterising it as being written in a clear and engaging manner , one reviewer noted that Sheppards book focuses on Murray the scientist and as such neglects to discuss Murrays involvement in magical practices and her relationship with Wicca.            Murrays witch-cult theories provided the blueprint for the  |contemporary_Pagan|Paganism|  religion of  |Wicca|Wicca| , with Murray being referred to as the Grandmother of Wicca . The  |Pagan_studies|Pagan_Studies|  scholar Ethan Doyle White stated that it was the theory which formed the historical narrative around which Wicca built itself , for on its emergence in England during the 1940s and 1950s, Wicca claimed to be the survival of this witch-cult. Wiccas theological structure, revolving around a Horned God and Mother Goddess, was adopted from Murrays ideas about the ancient witch-cult, and Wiccan groups were named covens and their meetings termed esbats, both words that Murray had popularised. As with Murrays witch-cult, Wiccas practitioners entered via an initiation ceremony; Murrays claims that witches wrote down their spells in a book may have been an influence on Wiccas  |Book_of_Shadows|Book_Of_Shadows| . Wiccas early  |system_of_seasonal_festivities|Wheel_Of_The_Year|  were also based on Murrays framework.     Noting that there is no evidence of Wicca existing before the publication of Murrays books, Merrifield commented that for those in 20th century Britain who wished to form their own witches covens, Murray may have seemed the ideal fairy godmother, and her theory became the pumpkin coach that could transport them into the realm of fantasy for which they longed . The historian  |Philip_Heselton|Philip_Heselton|  suggested that the  |New_Forest_coven|New_Forest_Coven|  – the oldest alleged Wiccan group – was founded circa 1935 by esotericists aware of Murrays theory and who may have believed themselves to be reincarnated witch-cult members. It was  |Gerald_Gardner|Gerald_Gardner| , who claimed to be an initiate of the New Forest coven, who established the tradition of  |Gardnerian_Wicca|Gardnerian_Wicca|  and popularised the religion; according to Simpson, Gardner was the only member of the Folklore Society to wholeheartedly accept Murrays witch-cult hypothesis. The duo knew each other, with Murray writing the foreword to Gardners 1954 book  Witchcraft Today , although in that foreword she did not explicitly specify whether she believed Gardners claim that he had discovered a survival of her witch-cult. In 2005, Noble suggested that Murrays name might be all but forgotten today if it were not for Gerald Gardner .          Murrays witch-cult theories were likely also a core influence on the non-Gardnerian Wiccan traditions that were established in Britain and Australia between 1930 and 1970 by the likes of  |Bob_Clay_Egerton|Bob_Clay_Egerton| ,  |Robert_Cochrane|Robert_Cochrane| ,  |Charles_Cardell|Charles_Cardell| , and  |Rosaleen_Norton|Rosaleen_Norton| .   The prominent Wiccan  |Doreen_Valiente|Doreen_Valiente|  eagerly searched for what she believed were other surviving remnants of the Murrayite witch-cult around Britain. Valiente remained committed to a belief in Murrays witch-cult after its academic rejection, and she described Murray as a remarkable woman . In  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco|  during the late 1960s, Murrays writings were among the sources used by  |Aidan_A_Kelly|Aidan_A_Kelly|  in the creation of his Wiccan tradition, the  |New_Reformed_Orthodox_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|New_Reformed_Orthodox_Order_Of_The_Golden_Dawn| . In  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles|  during the early 1970s, they were used by  |Zsuzsanna_Budapest|Zsuzsanna_Budapest|  when she was establishing her feminist-oriented tradition of  |Dianic_Wicca|Dianic_Wicca| . The Murrayite witch-cult theory also provided the basis for the ideas espoused in Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture, a 1978 book written by the American  |gay_liberation|Gay_Liberation|  activist  |Arthur_Evans|Arthur_Evans| .     Members of the Wiccan community gradually became aware of academias rejection of the witch-cult theory. Accordingly, belief in its literal truth declined during the 1980s and 1990s, with many Wiccans instead coming to view it as a myth that conveyed metaphorical or symbolic truths. Others insisted that the historical origins of the religion did not matter and that instead Wicca was legitimated by the spiritual experiences it gave to its participants. In response, Hutton authored  The Triumph of the Moon , a historical study exploring Wiccas early development; on publication in 1999 the book exerted a strong impact on the British Pagan community, further eroding belief in the Murrayite theory among Wiccans. Conversely, other practitioners clung on to the theory, treating it as an important  |article_of_faith|Article_Of_Faith|  and rejecting post-Murrayite scholarship on European witchcraft. Several prominent practitioners continued to insist that Wicca was a religion with origins stretching back to the Palaeolithic, but others rejected the validity of historical scholarship and emphasised intuition and emotion as the arbiter of truth. A few counter-revisionist Wiccans – among them  |Donald_H_Frew|Donald_H_Frew| , Jani Farrell-Roberts, and Ben Whitmore – published critiques in which they attacked post-Murrayite scholarship on matters of detail, but none defended Murrays original hypothesis completely.       Simpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the Encyclopædia Britannica made it accessible to journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers , who adopted it enthusiastically . It influenced the work of  |Aldous_Huxley|Aldous_Huxley|  and  |Robert_Graves|Robert_Graves| . It was also an influence on the American horror author  |H_P_Lovecraft|H_P_Lovecraft| , who cited The Witch-Cult in Western Europe in his writings about the fictional cult of  |Cthulhu|Cthulhu| .     The author  |Sylvia_Townsend_Warner|Sylvia_Townsend_Warner|  cited Murrays work on the witch-cult as an influence on her 1926 novel  Lolly Willowes , and sent a copy of her book to Murray in appreciation, with the two meeting for lunch shortly after. There was nevertheless some difference in their depictions of the witch-cult; whereas Murray had depicted an organised pre-Christian cult, Warner depicted a vague family tradition that was explicitly Satanic.   In 1927, Warner lectured on the subject of witchcraft, exhibiting a strong influence from Murrays work. Analysing the relationship between Murray and Warner, the English literature scholar Mimi Winick characterised both as being engaged in imagining new possibilities for women in modernity .       A bibliography of Murrays published work was published in Folklore by  |Wilfrid_Bonser|Wilfrid_Bonser|  in 1961, and her friend Drower produced a posthumous limited bibliography in 2004, and another limited bibliography appeared in Kathleen L. Sheppards 2013 biography of her.
