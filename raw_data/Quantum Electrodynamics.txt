In particle physics, quantum electrodynamics  is the  |relativistic|Relativity_Theory| |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory|  of  |electrodynamics|Electrodynamics| . In essence, it describes how  |light|Light|  and  |matter|Matter|  interact and is the first theory where full agreement between  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  and  |special_relativity|Special_Relativity|  is achieved. QED mathematically describes all  |phenomena|Phenomenon|  involving  |electrically_charged|Electric_Charge|  particles interacting by means of exchange of  |photons|Photon|  and represents the  |quantum|Quantum_Mechanics|  counterpart of  |classical_electromagnetism|Classical_Electromagnetism|  giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.     In technical terms, QED can be described as a  |perturbation_theory|Perturbation_Theory|  of the electromagnetic  |quantum_vacuum|Vacuum_State| .  |Richard_Feynman|Richard_Feynman|  called it the jewel of physics for its  |extremely_accurate_predictions|Precision_Tests_Of_Qed|  of quantities like the  |anomalous_magnetic_moment|Anomalous_Magnetic_Moment|  of the electron and the  |Lamb_shift|Lamb_Shift|  of the  |energy_levels|Energy_Level|  of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| .                 The first formulation of a  |quantum_theory|Quantum_Mechanics|  describing radiation and matter interaction is attributed to British scientist  |Paul_Dirac|Paul_Dirac| , who was able to compute the coefficient of  |spontaneous_emission|Spontaneous_Emission|  of an  |atom|Atom| .        Dirac described the quantization of the  |electromagnetic_field|Electromagnetic_Field|  as an ensemble of  |harmonic_oscillators|Harmonic_Oscillator|  with the introduction of the concept of  |creation_and_annihilation_operators|Creation_And_Annihilation_Operators|  of particles. In the following years, with contributions from  |Wolfgang_Pauli|Wolfgang_Pauli| ,  |Eugene_Wigner|Eugene_Wigner| ,  |Pascual_Jordan|Pascual_Jordan| ,  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg|  and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to  |Enrico_Fermi|Enrico_Fermi| ,    physicists came to believe that, in principle, it would be possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles. However, further studies by  |Felix_Bloch|Felix_Bloch|  with  |Arnold_Nordsieck|Arnold_Nordsieck| ,  and  |Victor_Weisskopf|Victor_Weisskopf| ,  in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of  |perturbation_theory|Perturbation_Theory| , a problem already pointed out by  |Robert_Oppenheimer|Robert_Oppenheimer| .  At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the internal consistency of the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between  |special_relativity|Special_Relativity|  and  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| .        Difficulties with the theory increased through the end of the 1940s. Improvements in  |microwave|Microwave|  technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a  |hydrogen_atom|Hydrogen_Atom| ,    now known as the  |Lamb_shift|Lamb_Shift|  and  |magnetic_moment|Magnetic_Moment|  of the electron.    These experiments exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain.     A first indication of a possible way out was given by  |Hans_Bethe|Hans_Bethe|  in 1947, after attending the  |Shelter_Island_Conference|Shelter_Island_Conference| .    While he was traveling by train from the conference to  |Schenectady|Schenectady|  he made the first non-relativistic computation of the shift of the lines of the hydrogen atom as measured by Lamb and  |Retherford|Robert_Retherford| .    Despite the limitations of the computation, agreement was excellent. The idea was simply to attach infinities to corrections of  |mass|Mass|  and  |charge|Charge|  that were actually fixed to a finite value by experiments. In this way, the infinities get absorbed in those constants and yield a finite result in good agreement with experiments. This procedure was named  |renormalization|Renormalization| .          Based on Bethes intuition and fundamental papers on the subject by  |Shinichirō_Tomonaga|Shinichirō_Tomonaga| ,     |Julian_Schwinger|Julian_Schwinger| ,        |Richard_Feynman|Richard_Feynman|           and  |Freeman_Dyson|Freeman_Dyson| ,       it was finally possible to get fully  |covariant|Lorentz_Covariance|  formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics. Shinichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman were jointly awarded with a  |Nobel_prize_in_physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  in 1965 for their work in this area.  Their contributions, and those of  |Freeman_Dyson|Freeman_Dyson| , were about  |covariant|Lorentz_Covariance|  and  |gauge_invariant|Gauge_Invariant|  formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of  |perturbation_theory|Perturbation_Theory| . Feynmans mathematical technique, based on his  |diagrams|Feynman_Diagram| , initially seemed very different from the field-theoretic,  |operator|Operator| -based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but  |Freeman_Dyson|Freeman_Dyson|  later showed that the two approaches were equivalent.  |Renormalization|Renormalization| , the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through  |integrals|Integral| , has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory|  and has come to be seen as a criterion for a theorys general acceptability. Even though renormalization works very well in practice, Feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical validity, even referring to renormalization as a shell game and hocus pocus .      QED has served as the model and template for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is  |quantum_chromodynamics|Quantum_Chromodynamics| , which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s work by  |H._David_Politzer|H._David_Politzer| ,  |Sidney_Coleman|Sidney_Coleman| ,  |David_Gross|David_Gross|  and  |Frank_Wilczek|Frank_Wilczek| . Building on the pioneering work of  |Schwinger|Julian_Schwinger| ,  |Gerald_Guralnik|Gerald_Guralnik| ,  |Dick_Hagen|C._R._Hagen| , and  |Tom_Kibble|Tom_W._B._Kibble| ,        |Peter_Higgs|Peter_Higgs| ,  |Jeffrey_Goldstone|Jeffrey_Goldstone| , and others,  |Sheldon_Lee_Glashow|Sheldon_Lee_Glashow| ,  |Steven_Weinberg|Steven_Weinberg|  and  |Abdus_Salam|Abdus_Salam|  independently showed how the  |weak_nuclear_force|Weak_Nuclear_Force|  and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single  |electroweak_force|Electroweak_Force| .             Near the end of his life,  |Richard_P._Feynman|Richard_P._Feynman|  gave a series of lectures on QED intended for the lay public. These lectures were transcribed and published as Feynman ,  |QED:_The_strange_theory_of_light_and_matter|Qed| , a classic non-mathematical exposition of QED from the point of view articulated below.     The key components of Feynmans presentation of QED are three basic actions.    : A  |photon|Photon|  goes from one place and time to another place and time.   : An  |electron|Electron|  goes from one place and time to another place and time.   : An electron emits or absorbs a photon at a certain place and time.        These actions are represented in the form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of  |Feynman_diagrams|Feynman_Diagrams| |probability_amplitudes|Quantum_Electrodynamicsprobability_Amplitudes| . The probability is the square of the absolute value of total probability amplitude,     f  2 . If a photon moves from one place and time A to another place and time B , the associated quantity is written in Feynmans shorthand as P . The similar quantity for an electron moving from C to D is written E . The quantity that tells us about the probability amplitude for the emission or absorption of a photon he calls j. This is related to, but not the same as, the measured  |electron_charge|Elementary_Charge|  e.      QED is based on the assumption that complex interactions of many electrons and photons can be represented by fitting together a suitable collection of the above three building blocks and then using the probability amplitudes to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction. It turns out that the basic idea of QED can be communicated while assuming that the square of the total of the probability amplitudes mentioned above  acts just like our everyday  |probability|Probability|  . Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman.     The basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are:             Suppose, we start with one electron at a certain place and time  and a photon at another place and time . A typical question from a physical standpoint is: What is the probability of finding an electron at C and a photon at D ? . The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from A to C and for the photon to move from B to D . From a knowledge of the probability amplitudes of each of these sub-processes – E and P – we would expect to calculate the probability amplitude of both happening together by multiplying them, using rule b to to  -   0.          -   0,      Lpkp + kkppkp - kkp .
