        Sir Humphry Davy, 1st Baronet   was a  |Cornish|Cornish_People| |_chemist|Chemist|  and inventor, who is best remembered today for isolating, using electricity, a series of  |elements|Chemical_Element|  for the first time:  |potassium|Potassium|  and  |sodium|Sodium|  in 1807 and  |calcium|Calcium| ,  |strontium|Strontium| ,  |barium|Barium| ,  |magnesium|Magnesium|  and  |boron|Boron|  the following year, as well as discovering the elemental nature of  |chlorine|Chlorine|  and  |iodine|Iodine| . He also studied the forces involved in these separations, inventing the new field of  |electrochemistry|Electrochemistry| . In 1799 Davy experimented with  |nitrous_oxide|Nitrous_Oxide|  and was astonished at how it made him laugh, so he nicknamed it laughing gas , and wrote about its potential  |anaesthetic|Anesthesia|  properties in relieving pain during surgery.       |Berzelius|Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|  called Davys 1806  |Bakerian_Lecture|Bakerian_Lecture|  On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity  one of the best memoirs which has ever enriched the theory of chemistry.    Davy was a  |baronet|Baronet| ,  |President_of_the_Royal_Society_|Presidents_Of_The_Royal_Society| ,  |Member_of_the_Royal_Irish_Academy_|Royal_Irish_Academy| , and  |Fellow_of_the_Geological_Society_|Geological_Society_Of_London| . He also invented the  |Davy_lamp|Davy_Lamp|  and a very early form of  |arc_lamp|Arc_Lamp| . He joked that his assistant  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday|  was his greatest discovery.       Davy was born in  |Penzance|Penzance| ,  |Cornwall|Cornwall|  in  |England|England|  on 17 December 1778, the eldest of the five children of Robert Davy, a woodcarver, and his wife Grace Millett. Davys brother,  |John|John_Davy| , writes that the society of their hometown was characterised by an almost unbounded credulity respecting the supernatural and monstrous ... Amongst the middle and higher classes, there was little taste for literature, and still less for science ... Hunting, shooting, wrestling, cockfighting, generally ending in drunkenness, were what they most delighted in .  At the age of six, Davy was sent to the grammar school at Penzance. Three years later, his family moved to Varfell, near  |Ludgvan|Ludgvan| , and subsequently, in term-time Davy boarded with John Tonkin, his godfather and later his guardian. On leaving Penzance grammar school in 1793, Tonkin paid for Davy to attend  |Truro_Grammar_School|Truro_Grammar_School|  in 1793 to finish his education under the Rev Dr Cardew, who, in a letter to  |Davies_Gilbert|Davies_Gilbert| , said dryly: I could not discern the faculties by which he was afterwards so much distinguished. Yet, Davy entertained his school friends with writing poetry, Valentines, and telling stories from  |One_Thousand_and_One_Nights|One_Thousand_And_One_Nights| . Reflecting on his school days, in a letter to his mother, Davy wrote: Learning naturally is a true pleasure; how unfortunate then it is that in most schools it is made a pain.  Davy said: I consider it fortunate I was left much to myself as a child, and put upon no particular plan of study ... What I am I made myself.  Davys brother praises his native vigour : there belonged, however, to his mind, it cannot be doubted, the genuine quality of genius, or of that power of intellect which exalts its possessor above the crowd.     After Davys father died in 1794, Tonkin apprenticed him to John Bingham Borlase, a surgeon with a practice in Penzance. Davys  |indenture|Indenture|  is dated 10 February 1795. In the  |apothecarys|Apothecary|  dispensary, Davy became a chemist, and conducted his earliest chemical experiments in a garret in Tonkins house. Davys friends said: This boy Humphry is incorrigible. He will blow us all into the air. His elder sister complained of the ravages made on her dresses by corrosive substances. Davy was taught French by a refugee priest, and in 1797 read Lavoisiers Traité élémentaire de chimie      |John_Ayrton_Paris|John_Ayrton_Paris|  remarked that poetry written by the young Davy bear the stamp of lofty genius . Davys first preserved poem entitled The Sons of Genius is dated 1795 and marked by the usual immaturity of youth. Other poems written in the following years, especially On the Mounts Bay and St Michaels Mount, are descriptive verses, showing sensibility but no true poetic imagination. Three of Davys paintings from around 1796 have been donated to the  |Penlee_House|Penlee_House|  museum at Penzance. One is of the view from above  |Gulval|Gulval|  showing the church,  |Mounts_Bay|Mounts_Bay|  and  |the_Mount|St_Michaels_Mount| , while the other two depict  |Loch_Lomond|Loch_Lomond|  in Scotland.  Davys picture of Mounts Bay was included in the Penlee House exhibition Penzance 400: A Celebration of the History of Penzance 29 March – 7 June 2014     While writing verses at the age of 17 in honour of his first love, he was eagerly discussing the question of the materiality of heat with his  |Quaker|Quaker|  friend and mentor  |Robert_Dunkin|Robert_Dunkin| . Dunkin remarked: I tell thee what, Humphry, thou art the most quibbling hand at a dispute I ever met with in my life. One winter day he took Davy to the Larigan River, The Larigan, or Laregan, river is a stream in Penzance. To show him that rubbing two plates of ice together developed sufficient energy by motion, to melt them, and that after the motion was suspended, the pieces were united by regelation. It was a crude form of analogous experiment exhibited by Davy in the lecture-room of the  |Royal_Institution|Royal_Institution|  that elicited considerable attention. As professor at the Royal Institution, Davy repeated many of the ingenious experiments he learned from his friend and mentor, Robert Dunkin.     Even though he initially started writing his poems, albeit haphazardly, as a reflection of his views on his career and on life generally, most of his final poems concentrated on immortality and death. This was after he started experiencing failing health and a decline both in health and career.         |Davies_Giddy|Davies_Gilbert|  met Davy in  |Penzance|Penzance|  carelessly swinging on the half-gate of Dr Borlases house, and interested by his talk invited him to his house at Tredrea and offered him the use of his library. This led to an introduction to Dr Edwards, who lived at Hayle Copper House. Edwards was a lecturer in chemistry in the school of  |St_Bartholomews_Hospital|St_Bartholomews_Hospital| . He permitted Davy to use his laboratory and possibly directed his attention to the floodgates of the port of  |Hayle|Hayle| , which were rapidly decaying as a result of the contact between copper and iron under the influence of  |seawater|Seawater| .  |Galvanic_corrosion|Galvanic_Corrosion|  was not understood at that time, but the phenomenon prepared Davys mind for subsequent experiments on ships  |copper_sheathing|Copper_Sheathing| . Gregory Watt, son of  |James_Watt|James_Watt| , visited Penzance for his healths sake, and while lodging at the Davys house became a friend and gave him instructions in chemistry. Davy was acquainted with the  |Wedgwood|Wedgwood|  family, who spent a winter at Penzance.      |Thomas_Beddoes|Thomas_Beddoes|  and  |John_Hailstone|John_Hailstone|  were engaged in a geological controversy on the rival merits of the  |Plutonian|Plutonism|  and  |Neptunist|Neptunist|  hypotheses. They travelled together to examine the Cornish coast accompanied by Davies Gilbert and made Davys acquaintance. Beddoes, who had established at  |Bristol|Bristol|  a Pneumatic Institution, needed an assistant to superintend the laboratory. Gilbert recommended Davy, and in 1798 Gregory Watt showed Beddoes the Young mans Researches on Heat and Light, which were subsequently published by him in the first volume of West-Country Contributions. After prolonged negotiations, mainly by Gilbert, Mrs Davy and Borlase consented to Davys departure, but Tonkin wished him to remain in his native town as a surgeon, and altered his will when he found that Davy insisted on going to Dr Beddoes.     In 1802, Humphry Davy had what was then, the most powerful electrical battery in the world at the Royal Institution. With it, Davy created the first  |incandescent_light|Incandescent_Light|  by passing electric current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because the metal had an extremely high melting point. It was neither sufficiently bright nor long lasting enough to be of practical use, but demonstrated the principle. By 1806 he was able to demonstrate a much more powerful form of electric lighting to the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  in London. It was an early form of  |arc_light|Arc_Lamp|  which produced its illumination from an electric arc created between two charcoal rods.          On 2 October 1798, Davy joined the  |Pneumatic_Institution|Pneumatic_Institution|  at Bristol. It had been established to investigate the medical powers of factitious airs and gases , and Davy was to superintend the various experiments. The arrangement agreed between Dr Beddoes and Davy was generous, and enabled Davy to give up all claims on his paternal property in favour of his mother. He did not intend to abandon the medical profession and was determined to study and graduate at Edinburgh, but he soon began to fill parts of the institution with voltaic batteries. While living in Bristol, Davy met the  |Earl_of_Durham|Earl_Of_Durham| , who was a resident in the institution for his health, and became close friends with Gregory Watt,  |James_Watt|James_Watt| ,  |Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge|Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge|  and  |Robert_Southey|Robert_Southey| , all of whom became regular users of  |nitrous_oxide|Nitrous_Oxide|  , to which Davy became addicted. The gas was first synthesized in 1772 by the  |natural_philosopher|Natural_Philosopher|  and chemist  |Joseph_Priestley|Joseph_Priestley| , who called it phlogisticated nitrous air .  Priestley described his discovery in the book Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air , in which he described how to produce the preparation of nitrous air diminished , by heating iron filings dampened with  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| .       James Watt built a portable gas chamber to facilitate Davys experiments with the inhalation of nitrous oxide. At one point the gas was combined with wine to judge its efficacy as a cure for  |hangover|Hangover|  . The gas was popular among Davys friends and acquaintances, and he noted that it might be useful for performing surgical operations. In his 1800 Researches, Chemical and Philosophical , Davy commented: As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place.  |Anesthetics|Anesthetic|  were not regularly used in medicine or dentistry until decades after Davys death.      Davy threw himself energetically into the work of the laboratory and formed a long romantic friendship with Mrs Anna Beddoes, the novelist  |Maria_Edgeworths|Maria_Edgeworth|  sister, who acted as his guide on walks and other fine sights of the locality. The critic Maurice Hindle was the first to reveal that Davy and Anna had written poems for each other.  Wahida Amin has transcribed and discussed a number of poems written between 1803 and 1808 to Anna and one to her infant child.  In December 1799 Davy visited London for the first time and extended his circle of friends. Davy features in the diary of William Godwin, with their first meeting recorded for 4 December 1799.      In the gas experiments Davy ran considerable risks. His respiration of  |nitric_oxide|Nitric_Oxide|  which may have combined with air in the mouth to form  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  , severely injured the mucous membrane, and in Davys attempt to inhale four quarts of pure hydrocarbonate gas in an experiment with  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide|  he seemed sinking into annihilation. On being removed into the open air, Davy faintly articulated, I do not think I shall die, but some hours elapsed before the painful symptoms ceased. Davy was able to take his own pulse as he staggered out of the laboratory and into the garden, and he described it in his notes as threadlike and beating with excessive quickness .     In this year the first volume of the West-Country Collections was issued. Half consisted of Davys essays On Heat, Light, and the Combinations of Light, On Phos-oxygen and its Combinations, and on the Theory of Respiration. On 22 February 1799 Davy, wrote to Davies Gilbert, I am now as much convinced of the non-existence of  |caloric|Caloric_Theory|  as I am of the existence of light. In another letter to Gilbert, on 10 April, Davy informs him: I made a discovery yesterday which proves how necessary it is to repeat experiments. The gaseous oxide of azote is perfectly respirable when pure. It is never deleterious but when it contains nitrous gas. I have found a mode of making it pure. He said that he breathed sixteen quarts of it for nearly seven minutes, and that it absolutely intoxicated me.   Davy became increasingly well known in 1799 due to his experiments with the physiological action of some gases, including laughing gas . In addition to himself, his enthusiastic experimental subjects included his poet friends  |Robert_Southey|Robert_Southey|  and  |Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge|Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge| .        During 1799, Beddoes and Davy published Contributions to physical and medical knowledge, principally from the west of England and Essays on heat, light, and the combinations of light, with a new theory of respiration. On the generation of oxygen gas, and the causes of the colors of organic beings. Their experimental work was poor, and the publications were harshly criticized. In after years Davy regretted he had ever published these immature hypotheses, which he subsequently designated the dreams of misemployed genius which the light of experiment and observation has never conducted to truth.     These criticisms, however, led Davy to refine and improve his experimental techniques, spending his later time at the institution increasingly in experimentation.   In 1800, Davy informed Gilbert that he had been repeating the galvanic experiments with success in the intervals of the experiments on the gases, which almost incessantly occupied him from January to April. In 1800, Davy published his Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous Oxide and its Respiration, and received a more positive response.      |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  and Samuel Taylor Coleridge moved to the  |Lake_District|Lake_District|  in 1800, and asked Davy to deal with the Bristol publishers of the  Lyrical Ballads , Biggs & Cottle. Coleridge asked Davy to proofread the second edition, the first to contain  |Wordsworths|William_Wordsworth| |_Preface_to_the_Lyrical_Ballads|Preface_To_The_Lyrical_Ballads|  , in a letter dated 16 July 1800: Will you be so kind as just to look over the sheets of the lyrical Ballads .   |Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  subsequently wrote to Davy on 29 July 1800, sending him the first manuscript sheet of poems and asking him specifically to correct: any thing you find amiss in the punctuation a business at which I am ashamed to say I am no adept .   |Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  was ill in the autumn of 1800 and slow in sending poems for the second edition; the volume appeared on 26 January 1801 even though it was dated 1800.  While it is impossible to know whether Davy was at fault, this edition of the Lyrical Ballads contained many errors, including the poem  |_Michael_|Michael|  being left incomplete.  In a personal notebook marked on the front cover Clifton 1800 From August to Novr , Davy wrote his own Lyrical Ballad: As I was walking up the street .  Wordsworth features in Davys poem as the recorder of ordinary lives in the line: By poet Wordsworths Rymes       In 1799,  |Count_Rumford|Count_Rumford|  had proposed the establishment in London of an Institution for Diffusing Knowledge, i.e. the  |Royal_Institution|Royal_Institution| . The house in  |Albemarle_Street|Albemarle_Street|  was bought in April 1799. Rumford became secretary to the institution, and Dr  |Thomas_Garnett|Thomas_Garnett|  was the first lecturer.        In February 1801 Davy was interviewed by the committee of the Royal Institution, comprising  |Joseph_Banks|Joseph_Banks| ,  |Benjamin_Thompson|Benjamin_Thompson|  and  |Henry_Cavendish|Henry_Cavendish| . Davy wrote to Davies Gilbert on 8 March 1801 about the offers made by Banks and Thompson, a possible move to London and the promise of funding for his work in galvanism. He also mentioned that he might not be collaborating further with Beddoes on therapeutic gases. The next day Davy left Bristol to take up his new post at the Royal Institution, it having been resolved that Humphry Davy be engaged in the service of the Royal Institution in the capacity of assistant lecturer in chemistry, director of the chemical laboratory, and assistant editor of the journals of the institution, and that he be allowed to occupy a room in the house, and be furnished with coals and candles, and that he be paid a salary of 100l. per annum.     On 25 April 1801, Davy gave his first lecture on the relatively new subject of Galvanism. He and his friend Coleridge had had many conversations about the nature of human knowledge and progress, and Davys lectures gave his audience a vision of human civilisation brought forward by scientific discovery. It has bestowed on him powers which may almost be called creative; which have enabled him to modify and change the beings surrounding him, and by his experiments to interrogate nature with power, not simply as a scholar, passive and seeking only to understand her operations, but rather as a master, active with his own instruments. The first lecture garnered rave reviews, and by the June lecture Davy wrote to John King that his last lecture had attendance of nearly 500 people. There was Respiration, Nitrous Oxide, and unbounded Applause. Amen!   Davy revelled in his public status.     Davys lectures included spectacular and sometimes dangerous chemical demonstrations along with scientific information, and were presented with considerable showmanship by the young and handsome man.    Davy also included both poetic and religious commentary in his lectures, emphasizing that Gods design was revealed by chemical investigations. Religious commentary was in part an attempt to appeal to women in his audiences. Davy, like many of his enlightenment contemporaries, supported female education and womens involvement in scientific pursuits, even proposing that women be admitted to evening events at the Royal Society.   Davy acquired a large female following around London. In a satirical cartoon by Gillray, nearly half of the attendees pictured are female. His support of women caused Davy to be subjected to considerable gossip and innuendo, and to be criticized as unmanly.      When Davys lecture series on Galvanism ended, he progressed to a new series on  |Agricultural_Chemistry|Agricultural_Chemistry| , and his popularity continued to skyrocket. By June 1802, after just over a year at the Institution and at the age of  23, Davy was nominated to full lecturer at the  |Royal_Institution|Royal_Institution|  of Great Britain. Garnett quietly resigned, citing health reasons.     In November 1804 Davy became a Fellow of the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society| , over which he would later preside. He was one of the founding members of the  |Geological_Society|Geological_Society|  in 1807 , UK. and was elected a foreign member of the  |Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences|Royal_Swedish_Academy_Of_Sciences|  in 1810 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the  |American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences|American_Academy_Of_Arts_And_Sciences|  in 1822.                   Davy was a pioneer in the field of  |electrolysis|Electrolysis|  using the  |voltaic_pile|Voltaic_Pile|  to split common compounds and thus prepare many new elements. He went on to electrolyse molten salts and discovered several new metals, including  |sodium|Sodium|  and  |potassium|Potassium| , highly reactive elements known as the  |alkali_metals|Alkali_Metal| . Davy discovered potassium in 1807, deriving it from  |caustic_potash|Caustic_Potash|  . Before the 19th century, no distinction had been made between potassium and sodium. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis. Davy isolated sodium in the same year by passing an electric current through molten  |sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide| .       During the first half of 1808, Davy conducted a series of further electrolysis experiments on alkaline earths including lime, magnesia, strontites and barytes. At the beginning of June, Davy received a letter from the Swedish chemist  |Berzelius|Berzelius|  claiming that he, in conjunction with Dr. Pontin, had successfully obtained amalgams of calcium and barium by electrolysing lime and barytes using a mercury cathode. Davy managed to successfully repeat these experiments almost immediately and expanded Berzelius method to strontites and magnesia.  He noted that while these amalgams oxidized in only a few minutes when exposed to air they could be preserved for lengthy periods of time when submerged in  |naphtha|Naphtha|  before becoming covered with a white crust.    On 30 June 1808 Davy reported to the Royal Society that he had successfully isolated four new metals which he named  |barium|Barium| ,  |calcium|Calcium| ,  |strontium|Strontium|  and magnium  which were subsequently published in the Philosophical Transactions. Although Davy conceded magnium was an undoubtedly objectionable name he argued the more appropriate name magnesium was already being applied to metallic manganese and wished to avoid creating an equivocal term.    The observations gathered from these experiments also led to Davy isolating  |boron|Boron|  in 1809.         |Chlorine|Chlorine|  was discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist  |Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele|Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele| , who called it  dephlogisticated marine acid   and mistakenly thought it contained  |oxygen|Oxygen| . Davy showed that the acid of Scheeles substance, called at the time  |oxymuriatic_acid|Chlorinehistory| , contained no  |oxygen|Oxygen| . This discovery overturned  |Lavoisiers|Antoine_Lavoisier|  definition of acids as compounds of oxygen. In 1810, chlorine was given its current name by Humphry Davy, who insisted that chlorine was in fact an  |element|Chemical_Element| .  The name chlorine, chosen by Davy for one of obvious and characteristic properties - its colour , comes from the Greek χλωρος , meaning green-yellow.       Davy seriously injured himself in a laboratory accident with  |nitrogen_trichloride|Nitrogen_Trichloride| .  French chemist  |Pierre_Louis_Dulong|Pierre_Louis_Dulong|  had first prepared this compound in 1811, and had lost two fingers and an eye in two separate explosions with it. In a letter to  |John_Children|John_George_Children| , on 16 November 1812, Davy wrote: It must be used with great caution. It is not safe to experiment upon a globule larger than a pins head. I have been severely wounded by a piece scarcely bigger. My sight, however, I am informed, will not be injured .  Davys accident induced him to hire  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday|  as a co-worker, particularly for assistance with handwriting and record keeping. He had recovered from his injuries by April 1813.             In 1812, Davy was  |knighted|Knight_Bachelor|  and gave up his lecturing position at the Royal Institution. He was given the title of Honorary Professor of Chemistry. He gave a farewell lecture to the Institution, and married a wealthy widow,  |Jane_Apreece|Jane_Davy| .     Davy then published his Elements of Chemical Philosophy, part 1, volume 1, though other parts of this title were never completed. He made notes for a second edition, but it was never required.   In October 1813, he and his wife, accompanied by  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday|  as his scientific assistant , travelled to France to collect the second edition of the  prix du Galvanisme , a medal that  |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon_Bonaparte|  had awarded Davy for his electro-chemical work. Faraday noted that Tis indeed a strange venture at this time, to trust ourselves in a foreign and hostile country, where so little regard is had to protestations of honour, that the slightest suspicion would be sufficient to separate us for ever from England, and perhaps from life.  Davys party sailed from Plymouth to Morlaix by  |cartel|Cartel| , where they were searched.     Upon reaching Paris, Davy was a guest of honour at a meeting of the First Class of the  |Institut_de_France|Institut_De_France|  and met with  |André_Marie_Ampère|André_Marie_Ampère|  and other French chemists.     While in Paris, Davy attended lectures at the  |Ecole_Polytechnique|Ecole_Polytechnique| , including those by  |Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac|Joseph_Louis_Gay_Lussac|  on a mysterious substance isolated by  |Bernard_Courtois|Bernard_Courtois| . Davy wrote a paper for the Royal Society on the element, which is now called  |iodine|Iodine| .   This led to a dispute between Davy and Gay-Lussac on who had the priority on the research.     Davys party did not meet Napoleon in person, but they did visit the Empress  |Joséphine_de_Beauharnais|Joséphine_De_Beauharnais|  at the  |Château_de_Malmaison|Château_De_Malmaison| . The party left Paris in December 1813, travelling south to Italy. For information on the continental tour of Davy and Faraday, see  They sojourned in  |Florence|Florence| , where using the  |burning_glass|Burning_Glass|  of the Grand Duke of Tuscany  in a series of experiments conducted with Faradays assistance, Davy succeeded in using the suns rays to ignite  |diamond|Diamond| , proving it is composed of pure  |carbon|Carbon| .     Davys party continued to Rome, where he undertook experiments on iodine and chlorine and on the colours used in ancient paintings. This was the first chemical research on the pigments used by artists.     He also visited  |Naples|Naples|  and  |Mount_Vesuvius|Mount_Vesuvius| , where he collected samples of crystals. By June 1814, they were in  |Milan|Milan| , where they met  |Alessandro_Volta|Alessandro_Volta| , and then continued north to  |Geneva|Geneva| . They returned to Italy via  |Munich|Munich|  and  |Innsbruck|Innsbruck| , and when their plans to travel to Greece and  |Istanbul|Istanbul|  were abandoned after Napoleons escape from  |Elba|Elba| , they returned to England.     After the  |Battle_of_Waterloo|Battle_Of_Waterloo| , Davy wrote to  |Lord_Liverpool|Robert_Jenkinson_2Nd_Earl_Of_Liverpool|  urging that the French be treated with severity:                        After his return to England in 1815, Davy began experimenting with lamps that could be used safely in coal mines. The Revd Dr Robert Gray of  |Bishopwearmouth|Bishopwearmouth|  in Sunderland, founder of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Coalmines, had written to Davy suggesting that he might use his extensive stores of chemical knowledge to address the issue of mining explosions caused by  |firedamp|Firedamp| , or  |methane|Methane|  mixed with oxygen, which was often ignited by the open flames of the lamps then used by miners. Incidents such as the  |Felling_mine_disaster|Felling_Mine_Disaster|  of 1812 near  |Newcastle|Newcastle_Upon_Tyne| , in which 92 men were killed, not only caused great loss of life among miners but also meant that their widows and children had to be supported by the public purse. The Revd Gray and a fellow clergyman also working in a north-east mining area, the Revd John Hodgson of  |Jarrow|Jarrow| , were keen that action should be taken to improve underground lighting and especially the lamps used by miners. Knight, David . Humphry Davy: Science and Power. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, pp. 105-6. .     Davy conceived of using an iron gauze to enclose a lamps flame, and so prevent the methane burning inside the lamp from passing out to the general atmosphere. Although the idea of the  |safety_lamp|Safety_Lamp|  had already been demonstrated by  |William_Reid_Clanny|William_Reid_Clanny|  and by the then unknown engineer  |George_Stephenson|George_Stephenson| , Davys use of  |wire_gauze|Wire_Gauze|  to prevent the spread of flame was used by many other inventors in their later designs. George Stephensons lamp was very popular in the north-east coalfields, and used the same principle of preventing the flame reaching the general atmosphere, but by different means. Unfortunately, although the new design of gauze lamp initially did seem to offer protection, it gave much less light, and quickly deteriorated in the wet conditions of most pits. Rusting of the gauze quickly made the lamp unsafe, and the number of deaths from firedamp explosions rose yet further.     There was some discussion as to whether Davy had discovered the principles behind his lamp without the help of the work of  |Smithson_Tennant|Smithson_Tennant| , but it was generally agreed that the work of both men had been independent. Davy refused to patent the lamp, and its invention led to his being awarded the  |Rumford_medal|Rumford_Medal|  in 1816.  |David_Knight|David_M_Knight|   in  Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ,  |Oxford_University_Press|Oxford_University_Press|        In 1815 Davy suggested that  |acids|Acid|  were substances that contained replaceable  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|   ions;– hydrogen that could be partly or totally replaced by  |reactive_metals|Metals|  which are placed above hydrogen in the reactivity series. When acids reacted with metals they formed  |salts|Salt|  and hydrogen gas.  |Bases|Base|  were substances that reacted with acids to form salts and water. These definitions worked well for most of the nineteenth century. HSC, Conquering Chemistry Fourth Edition p. 146.            Humphry Davy experimented on fragments of the Herculaneum papyri before his departure to Naples in 1818. His early experiments showed hope of success. In his report to the Royal Society Davy writes that:   When a fragment of a brown MS. in which the layers were strongly adhered, was placed in an atmosphere of chlorine, there was an immediate action, the papyrus smoked and became yellow, and the letters appeared much more distinct; and by the application of heat the layers separated from each other, giving fumes of muriatic acid.  |Davy_1821|Davy_1821| , page 193      The success of the early trials prompted Davy to travel to Naples to conduct further research on the Herculaneum papyri. Accompanied by his wife, they set off on 26 May 1818 to stay in Flanders where Davy was invited by the coal miners to speak.  They then traveled to Carniola which proved to become his favourite Alpine retreat before finally arriving in Italy. In Italy, they befriended Lord Byron in Rome and then went on to travel to Naples.      Initial experiments were again promising and his work resulted in partially unrolling 23 MSS., from which fragments of writing were obtained  |Davy_1821|Davy_1821| , page 203 but after returning to Naples on 1 December 1819 from a summer in the Alps, Davy complained that the Italians at the museum no longer helpful but obstructive. page 119 of Knight 1992 Davy decided to renounce further work on the papyri because the labour, in itself difficult and unpleasant, been made more so, by the conduct of the persons at the head of this department in the Museum.       From 1761 onwards, copper plating had been fitted to the undersides of  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  ships, to protect the wood from attack by  |shipworms|Shipworms| .  However, the copper bottoms were gradually corroded by exposure to the salt water. Between 1820 and 1825, Davy, assisted by  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday| , attempted to protect the copper by  |electrochemical|Electrochemistry|  means. He attached sacrificial pieces of  |zinc|Zinc|  or  |iron|Iron|  to the copper, which provided  |cathodic_protection|Cathodic_Protection|  to the host metal.  It was discovered, however, that protected copper became foul quickly, i.e. pieces of weed and/or marine creatures became attached to the hull, which had a detrimental effect on the handling of the ship. The  |Navy_Board|Navy_Board|  approached Davy in 1822, asking for help. Davy conducted a number of tests in  |Portsmouth_Dockyard|Portsmouth_Dockyard| , which led to the Navy Board adopting the use of Davys protectors . By 1824, it had become apparent that fouling of the copper bottoms was still occurring on the majority of protected ships. By the end of 1825, the  |Admiralty|Admiralty|  ordered the Navy Board to cease fitting the protectors to sea-going ships, and to remove those that had already been fitted. Davys scheme was seen as a public failure, despite the fact that, as Frank A. J. L. James comments, The somewhat ironical problem ... was not that they were unsuccessful. They did after all preserve the copper as Davy said they would. The problem was that the protectors, on most ships, had a chemical side effect which provided nutrients for weeds, barnacles etc. thus fouling the ships .       Elections took place on St Andrews Day and Davy was elected on 30 November 1820. Although he was unopposed, other candidates had received initial backing. These candidates embodied the factional difficulties that beset Davys presidency and which eventually defeated him.     The Society was in transition from a club for gentlemen interested in natural philosophy, connected with the political and social elite, to an academy representing increasingly specialised sciences. The previous president,  |Joseph_Banks|Joseph_Banks| , had held the post for over 40 years and had presided autocratically over what  |David_Philip_Miller|David_Philip_Miller|  calls the Banksian Learned Empire , in which natural history was prominent.  |David_Philip_Miller_|David_Philip_Miller_|  Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davys presidency of the Royal Society of London , British Journal for the History of Science : 1-47.     Banks had groomed the engineer, author and politician  |Davies_Gilbert|Davies_Gilbert|  to succeed him and preserve the status quo, but Gilbert declined to stand. Fellows who thought royal patronage was important proposed Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg , who also withdrew, as did the Whig  |Edward_St_Maur_11th_Duke_of_Somerset|Edward_St_Maur_11Th_Duke_Of_Somerset| . Davy was the outstanding scientist but some fellows did not approve of his popularising work at the Royal Institution.     The strongest alternative had been  |William_Hyde_Wollaston|William_Hyde_Wollaston| , who was supported by the Cambridge Network of outstanding mathematicians such as  |Charles_Babbage|Charles_Babbage|  and  |John_Herschel|John_Herschel| , who tried to block Davy. They were aware that Davy supported some modernisation, but thought that he would not sufficiently encourage aspiring young mathematicians, astronomers and geologists, who were beginning to form specialist societies. Davy was only 41, and reformers were fearful of another long presidency.     In his early years Davy was optimistic about reconciling the reformers and the Banksians. In his first speech as president he declared, I trust that, with these new societies, we shall always preserve the most amicable relations ... I am sure there is no desire in to exert anything like patriarchal authority in relation to these institutions . Cited in David Philip Miller, Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davys presidency of the Royal Society of London , British Journal for the History of Science : 30-31.     Davy spent much time juggling the factions but, as his reputation declined in the light of failures such as his research into copper-bottomed ships, he lost popularity and authority. This was compounded by a number of political errors. In 1825 his promotion of the new Zoological Society, of which he was a founding fellow, courted the landed gentry and alienated expert zoologists. He offended the mathematicians and reformers by failing to ensure that Babbage received one of the new Royal Medals or the vacant secretaryship of the Society in 1826. In November 1826 the mathematician Edward Ryan recorded that: The Society, every member almost ... are in the greatest rage at the Presidents proceedings and nothing is now talked of but removing him. Cited in David Philip Miller, Between hostile camps: Sir Humphry Davys presidency of the Royal Society of London , British Journal for the History of Science : 39.     In the event he was again re-elected unopposed, but he was now visibly unwell. In January 1827 he set off to Italy for reasons of his health. It did not improve and, as the 1827 election loomed, it was clear that he would not stand again. He was succeeded by  |Davies_Gilbert|Davies_Gilbert| .          In January 1819, Davy was awarded a  |baronet|Baronet| cy.  Although  |Sir_Francis_Bacon|Francis_Bacon|  and  |Sir_Isaac_Newton|Isaac_Newton|  had already been  |knight|Knight| ed, this was, at the time, the first such honour ever conferred on a man of science in Britain. This was followed a year later with the Presidency of the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society| .     Davys laboratory assistant,  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday| , went on to enhance Davys work and would become the more famous and influential scientist. Davy is supposed to have even claimed Faraday as his greatest discovery. Davy later accused Faraday of  |plagiarism|Plagiarism| , however, causing Faraday  to cease all research in  |electromagnetism|Classical_Electromagnetism|  until his mentors death.     Of a sanguine, somewhat irritable temperament, Davy displayed characteristic enthusiasm and energy in all his pursuits. As is shown by his verses and sometimes by his prose, his mind was highly imaginative; the poet Coleridge declared that if he had not been the first chemist, he would have been the first poet of his age , and Southey said that he had all the elements of a poet; he only wanted the art. In spite of his ungainly exterior and peculiar manner, his happy gifts of exposition and illustration won him extraordinary popularity as a lecturer, his experiments were ingenious and rapidly performed, and Coleridge went to hear him to increase his stock of metaphors. The dominating ambition of his life was to achieve fame; occasional petty jealousy did not diminish his concern for the cause of humanity , to use a phrase often employed by him in connection with his invention of the miners lamp. Careless about etiquette, his frankness sometimes exposed him to annoyances he might have avoided by the exercise of tact.      According to one of Davys biographers,  |June_Z_Fullmer|June_Z_Fullmer| , he was a  |deist|Deism| .         He spent the last months of his life writing Consolations in Travel, an immensely popular, somewhat freeform compendium of poetry, thoughts on science and philosophy. Published posthumously, the work became a staple of both scientific and family libraries for several decades afterward. Davy spent the winter in Rome, hunting in the  |Campagna|Roman_Campagna|  on his fiftieth birthday. But on 20 February 1829 he had another stroke. After spending many months attempting to recuperate, Davy died in a hotel room in Geneva, Switzerland, on 29 May 1829.     He had wished to be buried where he died, but had also wanted the burial delayed in case he was only  |coma|Coma| tose. He refused to allow a post-mortem for similar reasons. But the laws of Geneva did not allow any delay and he was given a public funeral on the following Monday, in the  |Plainpalais_Cemetery|Cimetière_Des_Rois| , outside the city walls.         Shortly after his funeral, his wife organised a memorial tablet for him in  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey|  at a cost of £142.  Davy is buried in plot 208 of the Plainpalais Cemetery, Rue des Rois, Geneva. For contemporary information on Davys funeral service and memorials, see    In 1872, a statue of Davy was erected in front of the  |Market_Building_Penzance|Market_Building_Penzance| ,  at the top of Market Jew Street, Penzance.    A commemorative slate plaque on 4 Market Jew Street, Penzance, claims the location as his birthplace.    A secondary school in Coombe Road, Penzance, is named  |Humphry_Davy_School|Humphry_Davy_School| .    A pub at 32 Alverton Street, Penzance, is named The Sir Humphry Davy .     One of the science buildings of the  |University_of_Plymouth|University_Of_Plymouth|  is named The Davy Building.    There is a road named Humphry Davy Way adjacent to the docks in Bristol.    Outside the entrance to  |Sunderland_Football_Clubs|Sunderland_Football_Club| |_Stadium_of_Light|Stadium_Of_Light|  stands a giant Davy Lamp, in recognition of local mining heritage and the importance of Davys safety lamp to the mining industry.

It has a diameter of 34  km and its coordinates are 11.8S, 8.1W. wenamethestars.inkleby.com/feature/1429   Davys passion for  |fly_fishing|Fly_Fishing|  earned him the informal title the father of modern fly-fishing and his book https://books.google.com/?idQy8CAAAAYAAJ & pgPA13 Salmonia is often considered to be the fly-fisherman bible .       Davy is the subject of a humorous song by  |Richard_Gendall|Richard_Gendall| , recorded in 1980 by folk-singer  |Brenda_Wootton|Brenda_Wootton|  in the album Boy Jan Cornishman,  the seven verses of which each recall a day of the week on which Davy purportedly made a particular discovery.    English playwright  |Nick_Darke|Nick_Darke|  wrote Laughing Gas a comedy script about the life of Sir Humphry Davy, unfinished at the time of Nick Darkes death; completed posthumously by actor and playwright Carl Grose and produced by the Truro-based production company O-region.    |Edmund_Clerihew_Bentleys|Edmund_Clerihew_Bentley|  first  |clerihew|Clerihew| , published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:   :Sir Humphry Davy   :Abominated gravy.   :He lived in the odium   :Of having discovered  |sodium|Sodium| .
