The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all that. I believe that the people are right when they continue to be moved by Córdoba, Mallorca, by the copla of the Sevillanas, by the Serenata, and Granada.

During the late 1880s, the strong influence of Spanish style is evident in Albénizs music. In 1883 Albéniz met the teacher and composer Felipe Pedrell.

Felipe Pedrell inspired Albéniz to write Spanish music such as the  Suite española , Op. 47, noted for its delicate, intricate melody and abrupt dynamic changes.     In addition to the Spanish spirit infused in Albénizs music, he incorporated other qualities as well.
