He is the son of  |William_Jefferson_Blythe_Jr.|William_Jefferson_Blythe_Jr.| , a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and  |Virginia_Dell_Cassidy|Virginia_Dell_Cassidy|  .  His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife.  Virginia traveled to  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans|  to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store. At a time when the southern United States was  |racially_segregated|Racial_Segregation_In_The_United_States| , Clintons grandparents sold goods on  |credit|Credit|  to people of all races.     In 1950, Bills mother returned from nursing school and married  |Roger_Clinton_Sr.|Roger_Clinton_Sr.| , who co-owned an  |automobile_dealership|Car_Dealership|  in  |Hot_Springs,_Arkansas|Hot_Springs,_Arkansas| , with his brother and  |Earl_T._Ricks|Earl_T._Ricks| .  The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.    Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfathers surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15  that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather. Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother,  |Roger_Clinton_Jr.|Roger_Clinton_Jr.| ; Clinton threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.      In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. Johns Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and  |Hot_Springs_High_School|Hot_Springs_High_School| , where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician. Clinton was in the chorus and played the  |tenor_saxophone|Tenor_Saxophone| , winning first chair in the state bands saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography  My Life      Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient  |Roman_Senator|Roman_Senator| |Catiline|Catiline|  in a mock trial in his Latin class.  After a vigorous defense that made use of his budding rhetorical and political skills , he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it made him realize that someday he would study law .      Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a  |Boys_Nation|Boys_Nation|  senator to the  |White_House|White_House|  to meet President  |John_F._Kennedy|John_F._Kennedy| . The other was watching  |Martin_Luther_King_Jr.s|Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|  1963  |I_Have_a_Dream|I_Have_A_Dream|  speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.                   With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the  |School_of_Foreign_Service|School_Of_Foreign_Service|  at  |Georgetown_University|Georgetown_University|  in Washington, D.C., receiving a  |Bachelor_of_Science_in_Foreign_Service|List_Of_Tagged_Degrees|  degree in 1968.     In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for  |class_president|Class_President| .  From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator  |J._William_Fulbright|J._William_Fulbright| . While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity  |Alpha_Phi_Omega|Alpha_Phi_Omega|   and was elected to  |Phi_Beta_Kappa|Phi_Beta_Kappa| . Clinton was also a member of the  |Order_of_DeMolay|Demolay_International| , , quote: Clinton was initiated into Hot Springs Chapter in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1961, where he served as Master Councilor. He received the Chevalier in 1964, and the Legion of Honor in 1979. Clinton was inducted into the DeMolay Hall of Fame on May 1, 1988.   a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a  |Freemason|Freemasonry| . He is a member of  |Kappa_Kappa_Psi|Kappa_Kappa_Psi|  honorary band fraternity.          Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a  |Rhodes_Scholarship|Rhodes_Scholarship|  to  |University_College,_Oxford|University_College,_Oxford| , where he initially read for a  |B.Phil.|B.Phil.|  in  |Philosophy,_Politics,_and_Economics|Philosophy,_Politics,_And_Economics|  but transferred to a  |B.Litt.|B.Litt.|  in politics and, ultimately, a  |B.Phil.|B.Phil.|  in politics.  Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at  |Yale_Law_School|Yale_Law_School| ,  |Yale_University|Yale_University| , but he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.       During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar  |Frank_Aller|Frank_Aller| . In 1969, Aller received a  |draft|Draft_Lottery|  letter that mandated deployment to the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| . Allers 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.  British writer and feminist  |Sara_Maitland|Sara_Maitland|  said of Clinton, I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasnt good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities werent enough and you had to do something about such things . He also developed an interest in  |rugby_union|Rugby_Union| , which he played at Oxford.      While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the  |University_of_Oxford|University_Of_Oxford| , specifically for being a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace , having a powerful collaborator in his wife, and for winning general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget .          During the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| , Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.  While at Oxford, he participated in  |Vietnam_War_protests|Opposition_To_The_Vietnam_War|  and organized a  |Moratorium_to_End_the_War_in_Vietnam|Moratorium_To_End_The_War_In_Vietnam|  event in October 1969. He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the  |National_Guard|National_Guard_Of_The_United_States|  or  |Air_Force|United_States_Air_Force| , and he then made arrangements to join the  |Reserve_Officers_Training_Corps|Reserve_Officers_Training_Corps|  program at the  |University_of_Arkansas|University_Of_Arkansas| .      He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way to maintain my political viability within the system .  Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number , meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers1 to 310 would be  |drafted|Draft_Lottery|  before him, making it unlikely he would be called up.       |Colonel|Colonel|  Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clintons ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a  |notarize|Notarize| d statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:     During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clintons uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the  |Navy_Reserve|United_States_Navy_Reserve| , which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.  Although legal, Clintons actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbrights influence to avoid military service.   Clintons 1992 campaign manager,  |James_Carville|James_Carville| , successfully argued that Clintons letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position. Public Broadcasting System, , 2000.         After Oxford, Clinton attended  |Yale_Law_School|Yale_Law_School|  and earned a  |Juris_Doctor|Juris_Doctor|  degree in 1973. In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the  |Yale_Law_Library|Lillian_Goldman_Law_Library| ; she was a class year ahead of him.  They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the  |George_McGovern|George_Mcgovern| |campaign|George_Mcgovern_Presidential_Campaign,_1972|  for the  |1972_United_States_presidential_election|1972_United_States_Presidential_Election|  in order to move in with her in California.  The couple continued  |living_together|Cohabitating|  in New Haven when they returned to law school.      Clinton eventually  |moved_to_Texas_with_Rodham_in_1972|1972_United_States_Presidential_Election_In_Texasrole_Of_The_Clintons_In_The_Mcgovern_Campaign|  to take a job leading McGoverns effort there. He spent considerable time in  |Dallas|Dallas| , at the campaigns local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term  |mayor_of_Dallas|List_Of_Mayors_Of_Dallas| |Ron_Kirk|Ron_Kirk| ,  future  |governor_of_Texas|List_Of_Governors_Of_Texas| |Ann_Richards|Ann_Richards| ,  and then unknown television director  |Steven_Spielberg|Steven_Spielberg| .      Bill married Hillary on October 11, 1975, and their only child,  |Chelsea|Chelsea_Clinton| , was born on February 27, 1980.                       After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the  |University_of_Arkansas|University_Of_Arkansas| . In 1974, he ran for the  |House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives| . Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican  |John_Paul_Hammerschmidt|John_Paul_Hammerschmidt| , Clintons campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the  |Watergate_scandal|Watergate_Scandal| . Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52  percent to 48  percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for  |Arkansas_Attorney_General|Arkansas_Attorney_General| . With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,  Clinton was elected.             In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the states history. Clinton was elected  |Governor_of_Arkansas|Governor_Of_Arkansas|  in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate  |Lynn_Lowe|Lynn_Lowe| , a farmer from  |Texarkana|Texarkana,_Arkansas| . Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.  Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the Boy Governor .    He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansass roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens anger over the escape of Cuban refugees  detained in  |Fort_Chaffee|Fort_Chaffee|  in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of  |Kingsland|Kingsland,_Arkansas|  in  |Cleveland_County|Cleveland_County,_Arkansas| , polled 31  percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzloses unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clintons defeat by  |Republican|Republican_Party|  challenger  |Frank_D._White|Frank_D._White|  in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nations history.     Clinton joined friend  |Bruce_Lindseys|Bruce_Lindsey|  Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.  In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansass economy and improved the states educational system. For  |senior_citizens|Senior_Citizen| , he removed the  |sales_tax|Sales_Tax|  from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the  |New_Democrats|New_Democrats| , a group of  |Democrats|Democratic_Party|  who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the  |Democratic_Leadership_Council|Democratic_Leadership_Council|  , the New Democrats argued that in light of President  |Ronald_Reagans|Ronald_Reagan| |landslide_victory_in_1984|1984_United_States_Presidential_Election| , the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.   Clinton delivered the  |Democratic_response|Democratic_Response_To_The_State_Of_The_Union_Address|  to Reagans  |1985_State_of_the_Union_Address|1985_State_Of_The_Union_Address|  and served as chair of the  |National_Governors_Association|National_Governors_Association|  from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.      In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clintons wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the  |Legal_Services_Corporation|Legal_Services_Corporation| . The committee transformed Arkansass education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools , better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special  |legislative_session|Arkansas_General_Assembly| —the longest in Arkansas history.  Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe , White ,  |Jonesboro|Jonesboro,_Arkansas|  businessmen  |Woody_Freeman|Woody_Freeman|  , and  |Sheffield_Nelson|Sheffield_Nelson|  of Little Rock .     Also in the 1980s, The Clintons personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the  |Whitewater_controversy|Whitewater_Controversy|  investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.  After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.      According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.  During Clintons term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 .  As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by  |electric_chair|Electric_Chair|  and three by  |lethal_injection|Lethal_Injection| . Later, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.          In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the Presidential race after incumbent  |New_York_Governor|Governor_Of_New_York| |Mario_Cuomo|Mario_Cuomo|  declined to run and Democratic front-runner  |Gary_Hart|Gary_Hart|  withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities.  Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor . David Maraniss, First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton . For the nomination, Clinton endorsed  |Massachusetts_Governor|Governor_Of_Massachusetts| |Michael_Dukakis|Michael_Dukakis| . He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the  |1988_Democratic_National_Convention|1988_Democratic_National_Convention| , but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long  and poorly delivered.  Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate  |Democratic_Leadership_Council|Democratic_Leadership_Council|  in 1990 and 1991.               During his presidency,  |Clinton_advocated_for_a_wide_variety_of_legislation_and_programs|Presidency_Of_Bill_Clintonlegislation_And_Programs| , most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the  |North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|  and  |welfare_reform|Welfare_Reform| , have been attributed to a  |centrist|Centrism| |Third_Way|Third_Way|  philosophy of governance.   His policy of  |fiscal_conservatism|Fiscal_Conservatism|  helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.   Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.    The  |Congressional_Budget_Office|Congressional_Budget_Office|  reported budget surpluses of $69  billion in 1998, $126  billion in 1999, and $236  billion in 2000,  during the last three years of Clintons presidency.  Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.   Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.  At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to  |Chappaqua,_New_York|Chappaqua,_New_York| , in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.              In the first primary contest, the  |Iowa_Caucus|Iowa_Caucuses| , Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator  |Tom_Harkin|Tom_Harkin| . During the campaign for the  |New_Hampshire_primary|New_Hampshire_Primary| , reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with  |Gennifer_Flowers|Gennifer_Flowers| . Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator  |Paul_Tsongas|Paul_Tsongas|  in the New Hampshire polls. Following  |Super_Bowl_XXVI|Super_Bowl_Xxvi| , Clinton and his wife Hillary went on  60 Minutes  to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the  |New_Hampshire_primary|1992_United_States_Presidential_Election_In_New_Hampshire| , but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him The Comeback Kid for earning a firm second-place finish.      Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the  |Southern_primaries|Southern_United_States|  on  |Super_Tuesday|Super_Tuesday|  gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor  |Jerry_Brown|Jerry_Brown|  was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in  |Jerry_Browns|Jerry_Brown|  home state of California.        During the campaign, questions of  |conflict_of_interest|Conflict_Of_Interest|  regarding state business and the politically powerful  |Rose_Law_Firm|Rose_Law_Firm| , at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillarys firm pay.  Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents for the price of one .      Clinton was still the Governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that  |Ricky_Ray_Rector|Ricky_Ray_Rector|  would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clintons return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for  The New York Times  as a possible political move to counter soft on crime accusations.  |George_Stephanopoulos|George_Stephanopoulos| , All Too Human: A Political Education, 1999,       Bushs  |approval_ratings|United_States_Presidential_Approval_Rating|  were around 80  percent during the  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| , and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his  |promise_not_to_raise_taxes|Read_My_Lips:_No_New_Taxes| , which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40  percent.  Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When  |Pat_Buchanan|Pat_Buchanan|  and  |Pat_Robertson|Pat_Robertson|  addressed Christian themes at the  |Republican_National_Convention|1992_Republican_National_Convention| —with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated.  Clinton then pointed to his moderate, New Democrat record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.  Many Democrats who had supported  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan|  and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.  Clinton and his running mate,  |Al_Gore|Al_Gore| , toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a new beginning .        Clinton won the  |1992_presidential_election|1992_United_States_Presidential_Election|  against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush and billionaire  |populist|Populism| |Ross_Perot|Ross_Perot|  , who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bushs steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clintons success. Clintons victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the  |White_House|White_House|  and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the  |United_States_Congress|United_States_Congress| , the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the  |96th_United_States_Congress|96Th_United_States_Congress|  during the  |presidency_of_Jimmy_Carter|Presidency_Of_Jimmy_Carter| .                   Clinton was  |inaugurated|First_Inauguration_Of_Bill_Clinton|  as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less than a month after taking office, he signed the  |Family_and_Medical_Leave_Act_of_1993|Family_And_Medical_Leave_Act_Of_1993| , which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,  and was popular with the public.      Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in  Roe v. Wade —Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international  |family_planning|Family_Planning|  programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush. Sharon L. Camp, The Politics of U.S. Population Assistance, in Beyond the Numbers: A Reader on Population, Consumption and the Environment , p. 130. Clinton said abortion should be kept safe, legal, and rare —a slogan that had been suggested by  |University_of_California,_San_Diego|University_Of_California,_San_Diego|  political scientist  |Samuel_L._Popkin|Samuel_L._Popkin|  and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning. Amy Sullivan, The Party Faithful: How and Why Democrats Are Closing the God Gap , pp. 91–92. During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18.4 percent. Sullivan, The Party Faithful, pp. 236–237.     On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a  |budget_deficit|Budget_Deficit| .  Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a  |joint_session_of_Congress|Joint_Session_Of_Congress| , Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.  Clintons advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.      On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the  |White_House_travel_office_controversy|White_House_Travel_Office_Controversy|  even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be  |dismissed_without_cause|At-Will_Employment| . The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.  Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.      In August, Clinton signed the  |Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1993|Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_Of_1993| , which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90  percent of small businesses,  and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2  percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over a number of years through the implementation of spending restraints.           On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding  |a_health_care_reform_plan|Clinton_Health_Care_Plan| ; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clintons legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the  |American_Medical_Association|American_Medical_Association| , and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer  |John_F._Harris|John_F._Harris|  said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the  |White_House|White_House| . Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by  |George_J._Mitchell|George_J._Mitchell|  failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.     In November 1993,  |David_Hale|David_Hale| —the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the  |Whitewater_controversy|Whitewater_Controversy| —alleged that while he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons partner in the Whitewater land deal.  A  |U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission|U.S._Securities_And_Exchange_Commission|  investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wifes innocence in the affair.     On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the  |Brady_Bill|Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act| , which mandated federal  |background_checks|Background_Check|  on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the  |NICS_system|National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_System|  was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the  |Earned_Income_Tax_Credit|Earned_Income_Tax_Credit| , a subsidy for low-income workers.     In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers  |Larry_Patterson|Larry_Patterson|  and Roger Perry were first reported by  |David_Brock|David_Brock|  in  The American Spectator . In the affair later known as  |Troopergate|Troopergate|  , the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to  |Paula_Jones|Paula_Jones| . Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated bad journalism , and that the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives .           That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as  |Dont_Ask,_Dont_Tell|Dont_Ask,_Dont_Tell|  , which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individuals sexual orientation.  The policy was developed as a compromise after Clintons proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators  |John_McCain|John_Mccain|  and  |Sam_Nunn|Sam_Nunn|  . According to  |David_Mixner|David_Mixner| , Clintons support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that the President should lift the ban  ... even though was sure to be overridden by the Congress .  Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.  Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President  |Harry_S._Truman|Harry_S._Truman|  used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clintons defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not out of whack .  The policy remained controversial, and was finally  |repealed_in_2011|Dont_Ask,_Dont_Tell_Repeal_Act_Of_2010| , removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.           On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the  |North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement|  into law.  Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of  |Ross_Perot|Ross_Perot| . The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed . The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.     The  |Omnibus_Crime_Bill|Violent_Crime_Control_And_Law_Enforcement_Act| , which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,  made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clintons re-election campaign he said, My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.  It also included a subsection of  |assault_weapons_ban|Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban|  for a ten-year period.     On October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official  |White_House|White_House|  website,  |whitehouse.gov|Whitehouse.Gov| .   The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000.   The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up Americas government to more of Americas citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011—Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.      After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the  |mid-term_elections_in_1994|1994_United_States_House_Of_Representatives_Elections| , for the first time in forty years.           The  |White_House_FBI_files_controversy|White_House_Fbi_Files_Controversy|  of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to  |FBI|Fbi|  security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.  In March 2000, Independent Counsel  |Robert_Ray|Robert_Ray|  determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Rays report further stated, there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved in seeking the files.      On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the  |Defense_of_Marriage_Act|Defense_Of_Marriage_Act|  , which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.   |Paul_Yandura|Paul_Yandura| , speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clintons signing DOMA was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election . In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states , a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a very reactionary Congress .  Administration spokesman  |Richard_Socarides|Richard_Socarides|  said, the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.  Clinton himself said DOMA was something which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think its obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that .  Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist  |Evan_Wolfson|Evan_Wolfson|  has called these claims historic revisionism . In a July 2, 2011, editorial  The New York Times  opined, The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.  Ultimately, in  |United_States_v._Windsor|United_States_V._Windsor| , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.      Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,  and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.  During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees Volsky, Igor.   and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.  Under Clintons leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.  Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector  |Employment_Non-Discrimination_Act|Employment_Non-Discrimination_Act| , which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.  Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clintons election and reelection by the  |Human_Rights_Campaign|Human_Rights_Campaign| . Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009  and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.  He was later honored by  |GLAAD|Glaad|  for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.           The  |1996_United_States_campaign_finance_controversy|1996_United_States_Campaign_Finance_Controversy|  was an alleged effort by the Peoples Republic of China to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.   Despite the evidence,  the  |Chinese_government|Government_Of_China|  denied all accusations.      As part of a 1996 initiative to curb  |illegal_immigration|Illegal_Immigration_To_The_United_States| , Clinton signed the  |Illegal_Immigration_Reform_and_Immigrant_Responsibility_Act|Illegal_Immigration_Reform_And_Immigrant_Responsibility_Act_Of_1996|  on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,  the  |U.S._Commission_on_Immigration_Reform|History_Of_Laws_Concerning_Immigration_And_Naturalization_In_The_United_States1990S|  recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.        |Ken_Gormley|Ken_Gormley| , author of The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr, reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the  |Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation|Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation|  forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device .  According to officials, the IED was large enough to blow up the entire presidential motorcade .  Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by  |Lewis_C._Merletti|Lewis_C._Merletti| , former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the  |Secret_Service|United_States_Secret_Service| . Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge. This alerted Merletti and others as Clintons motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila. Once more, the word wedding was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt. Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high.  Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag.  Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base. The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as  |al-Qaeda|Al-Qaeda|  and the plot was masterminded by  |Osama_bin_Laden|Osama_Bin_Laden| . Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.                 In the  |1996_presidential_election|1996_United_States_Presidential_Election| , Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2  percent of the popular vote over Republican  |Bob_Dole|Bob_Dole|  and  |Reform|Reform_Party_Of_The_United_States_Of_America|  candidate  |Ross_Perot|Ross_Perot|  , becoming the first Democratic incumbent since  |Lyndon_B._Johnson|Lyndon_B._Johnson|  to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since  |Franklin_D._Roosevelt|Franklin_D._Roosevelt|  to be elected president more than once.  The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate, but retained control of both houses of the  |105th_United_States_Congress|105Th_United_States_Congress| . Clinton received 379, or over 70  percent of the  |Electoral_College|Electoral_College|  votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes.         In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators  |Ted_Kennedy|Ted_Kennedy| —a Democrat—and  |Orrin_Hatch|Orrin_Hatch| —a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the  |State_Childrens_Health_Insurance_Program|State_Childrens_Health_Insurance_Program|  , the largest health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the  |Adoption_and_Safe_Families_Act|Adoption_And_Safe_Families_Act|  and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the  |Foster_Care_Independence_Act|Foster_Care_Independence_Act| . Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the  |Balanced_Budget_Act_of_1997|Balanced_Budget_Act_Of_1997|  by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.  In 1999 he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the  |Gramm–Leach–Bliley_Act|Gramm–Leach–Bliley_Act| , which repealed the part of the  |Glass–Steagall_Act|Glass–Steagall_Act|  that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of  |investment|Investment_Banking| ,  |commercial_bank|Commercial_Bank| ing, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.                  Clinton was  |impeached|Impeachment|  on December 19, 1998 by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228-206 to impeach him for perjury to a  |grand_jury|Grand_Jury|   and voted 221-212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.  Clinton was only the second U.S. president  to be impeached.   Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House  employee  |Monica_Lewinsky|Monica_Lewinsky| .  After the  |Starr_Report|Starr_Report|  was submitted to the House providing what it termed substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment ,  the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the  |mid-term_elections|United_States_Midterm_Election| . To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a  |lame-duck_session|Lame-Duck_Session|  in December 1998.        While the  |House_Judiciary_Committee|House_Judiciary_Committee|  hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House were for  |perjury|Perjury|  and  |obstruction_of_justice|Obstruction_Of_Justice| . The perjury charge arose from Clintons testimony before a  |grand_jury|Grand_Jury|  that had been convened to investigate  |perjury|Perjury|  he may have committed in his sworn deposition during  Jones v. Clinton ,  |Paula_Joness|Paula_Jones|  sexual harassment lawsuit.  The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.     The Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.  The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm  |Williams_&_Connolly|Williams_&_Connolly| .  The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.  Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.     On January 19, 2001, Clintons law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.           Clinton  |controversially_issued|Bill_Clinton_Pardon_Controversy|  141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.  Most of the controversy surrounded  |Marc_Rich|Marc_Rich|  and allegations that Hillary Clintons brother,  |Hugh_Rodham|Hugh_Edwin_Rodham| , accepted payments in return for influencing the presidents decision-making regarding the pardons.  Federal prosecutor  |Mary_Jo_White|Mary_Jo_White|  was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican  |James_Comey|James_Comey| , who found no wrongdoing on Clintons part. Some of Clintons pardons remain a point of controversy.                  During his presidency, Clinton and the U.S. military and diplomatic forces were involved in conflicts in several areas of the world. Clinton played a key role in peace talks in Northern Ireland and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and U.S. troops were involved in conflicts in Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and other regions.         The  |Battle_of_Mogadishu|Battle_Of_Mogadishu|  occurred in  |Somalia|Somalia|  in 1993. During the operation,  |two_U.S._helicopters|Mh-60_Black_Hawk|  were shot down by  |rocket-propelled_grenade|Rocket-Propelled_Grenade|  attacks to their  |tail_rotors|Tail_Rotor| , trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs.  In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.         In April 1994,  |genocide|Rwandan_Genocide|  broke out in  |Rwanda|Rwanda| . Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a final solution to eliminate all Tutsis was planned.  Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somolia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.  President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying I dont think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.          In 1995, U.S. and  |NATO|Nato|  aircraft  |bombed_Bosnian_Serb_targets|1995_Nato_Bombing_Campaign_In_Bosnia_And_Herzegovina|  to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the  |Bosnian_war|Bosnian_War| . Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent  |Dayton_Agreement|Dayton_Agreement| .         In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to  |Northern_Ireland|Northern_Ireland| , but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the  |UK|Uk|  government. In 1994 Clinton angered London by granting a visa to  |Gerry_Adams|Gerry_Adams| , leader of  |Sinn_Féin|Sinn_Féin| , the  |IRAs|Irish_Republican_Army|  political arm. In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of  |Belfast|Belfast|  and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during  |the_Troubles|The_Troubles| .  Despite  |unionist|Unionism_In_Ireland|  criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London,  |Dublin|Dublin| , the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the  |peace_talks|Northern_Ireland_Peace_Process| , which eventually led to the  |Good_Friday_Agreement|Good_Friday_Agreement|  in 1998.             In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8million  in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice|  after the shooting down of  |Iran_Air_Flight_655|Iran_Air_Flight_655|  by the U.S. Navy  |guided_missile_cruiser|Guided_Missile_Cruiser| .          Capturing  |Osama_bin_Laden|Osama_Bin_Laden|  had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton .  Despite claims by  |Mansoor_Ijaz|Mansoor_Ijaz|  and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,  the  |9/11_Commission_Report|9/11_Commission_Report|  stated that we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim .      In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden  and the  |1998_bombings_of_U.S._embassies_in_East_Africa|1998_United_States_Embassy_Bombings|  by  |al-Qaeda|Al-Qaeda|  , Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton  |ordered_cruise_missile_strikes_on_terrorist_targets_in_Afghanistan_and_Sudan|Operation_Infinite_Reach| , targeting the  |Al-Shifa_pharmaceutical_factory|Al-Shifa_Pharmaceutical_Factory|  in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Ladens terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.               To stop the  |ethnic_cleansing|Ethnic_Cleansing|     of Albanians by anti-guerilla military units in the former  |Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavias|Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia|  province of  |Kosovo|Kosovo| , Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a  |NATO|Nato|  bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named  |Operation_Allied_Force|Operation_Allied_Force| . General  |Wesley_Clark|Wesley_Clark|  was  |Supreme_Allied_Commander_of_NATO|Supreme_Allied_Commander_Europe|  and oversaw the mission. With  |United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1244|United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1244| , the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a  |peacekeeping_force|Kosovo_Force|  to be deployed to the region.  NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,  though two died in an  |Apache_helicopter|Boeing_Ah-64_Apache|  crash.  Opinions in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated.   Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long  |conflict_in_Kosovo|Kosovo_War|  had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing.   In a post-war inquiry, the  |Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe|Organization_For_Security_And_Co-Operation_In_Europe|  noted the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24 .  In 2001, the  |U.N.-supervised|United_Nations_Interim_Administration_Mission_In_Kosovo| |Supreme_Court_of_Kosovo|Judiciary_Of_Kosovo|  ruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments .  The term ethnic cleansing was used as an alternative to genocide to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.   |Slobodan_Milošević|Slobodan_Milošević| , the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was  |eventually_brought_to_trial|Trial_Of_Slobodan_Milošević|  before the  |International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia|International_Criminal_Tribunal_For_The_Former_Yugoslavia|  in  |the_Hague|The_Hague|  on charges including  |crimes_against_humanity|Crimes_Against_Humanity|  and war crimes for his role in the Kosovo war.  Milošević died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.          In Clintons  |1998_State_of_the_Union_Address|1998_State_Of_The_Union_Address| , he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator  |Saddam_Hussein|Saddam_Hussein|  was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:          Seeking to weaken Husseins grip on power, Clinton signed the  |Iraq_Liberation_Act_of_1998|Iraq_Liberation_Act_Of_1998|  into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of regime change against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.   The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named  |Operation_Desert_Fox|Operation_Desert_Fox| , lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.  American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.           Clintons November 2000 visit to  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| .  On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the  |U.S.–China_Relations_Act_of_2000|U.S.–China_Relations_Act_Of_2000| , which granted  |permanent_normal_trade_relations|Permanent_Normal_Trade_Relations|  trade status to Peoples Republic of China.  The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.  Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal  |budget_surplus|United_States_Federal_Budget|  for the first time since 1969.                  Relations were damaged for a time by the  |U.S._bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade|United_States_Bombing_Of_The_Chinese_Embassy_In_Belgrade|  in May 1999. President Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.      The  |U.S.–China_Relations_Act_of_2000|United_States–China_Relations_Act_Of_2000|  granted China  |permanent_normal_trade_relations|Permanent_Normal_Trade_Relations|  status  when China becomes a full member of the  |World_Trade_Organization|World_Trade_Organization|  , ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000 by Clinton.    President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and Chinas accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance Americas economic interests: Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets—with a fifth of the worlds population, potentially the biggest markets in the world—to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways, said Clinton. , Federal News Service, March 9, 2000     U.S. manufacturing jobs have decreased by almost five million since 2000.  Since the entry of China into the WTO in 2001, the decline in  |manufacturing_jobs|Manufacturing_In_The_United_States|  has accelerated.           After initial successes such as the  |Oslo_Accords|Oslo_Accords|  of the early 1990s, which also led to the  |Israel–Jordan_peace_treaty|Israel–Jordan_Peace_Treaty|  in 1994 and the  |Wye_River_Memorandum|Wye_River_Memorandum|  in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the  |Israeli–Palestinian_conflict|Israeli–Palestinian_Conflict| . He brought Israeli Prime Minister  |Ehud_Barak|Ehud_Barak|  and Palestinian Authority chairman  |Yasser_Arafat|Yasser_Arafat|  together at  |Camp_David|Camp_David|  for the  |Camp_David_Summit|2000_Camp_David_Summit|  in July 2000, which lasted 14 days. Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had missed the opportunity to facilitate a just and lasting peace . In his  |autobiography|My_Life| , Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit.  Following another attempt in December 2000 at  |Bolling_Air_Force_Base|Bolling_Air_Force_Base| , in which the president offered the  |Clinton_Parameters|The_Clinton_Parameters| , the situation broke down completely after the end of the  |Taba_Summit|Taba_Summit|  and with the start of the  |Second_Intifada|Second_Intifada| .                 Clinton appointed two justices to the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States| |Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg|Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg|  in 1993  and  |Stephen_Breyer|Stephen_Breyer|  in 1994.      Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the  |United_States_courts_of_appeals|United_States_Courts_Of_Appeals|  and 305 judges to the  |United_States_district_courts|United_States_District_Court| . His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan. Clinton also experienced a number of  |judicial_appointment_controversies|Bill_Clinton_Judicial_Appointment_Controversies| , as 69 nominees to  |federal_judgeships|United_States_Federal_Judge|  did not receive a vote in the  |Republican|Republican_Party| -controlled  |Senate_Judiciary_Committee|Senate_Judiciary_Committee| . In all, 84  percent of his nominees were confirmed.       |Sonia_Sotomayor|Sonia_Sotomayor|  was one of the judges who Clinton appointed to the Court of Appeals. She was nominated by Clinton in 1997, to the  |Second_Circuit|United_States_Court_Of_Appeals_For_The_Second_Circuit| . Sotomayor was confirmed in 1998, following a delay of more than a year that was caused by Republican opposition. Meg Greene, Sonia Sotomayor: A Biography , pp. 121–129.      Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. Nancy Scherer, Scoring Points: Politicians, Activists, and the Lower Federal Court Appointment Process , p. 85. In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clintons court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Scherer, p. 85. Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the  |Fourth_Circuit|United_States_Court_Of_Appeals_For_The_Fourth_Circuit|   and the  |Seventh_Circuit|United_States_Court_Of_Appeals_For_The_Seventh_Circuit|  .

Throughout Clintons first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.  After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clintons rating reached its highest point.  According to a  |CBS_News|Cbs_News| / New York Times  poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68  percent, which matched those of  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan|  and  |Franklin_D._Roosevelt|Franklin_D._Roosevelt|  as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.  Clintons average  |Gallup_poll|Gallup_Organization|  approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years. David W. Moore, , Gallup Organization . Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.     As he was leaving office, a CNN/ USA Today /Gallup poll revealed that 45  percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55  percent thought he would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life ; 68  percent thought he would be remembered more for his involvement in personal scandal than for his accomplishments ; and 58  percent answered No to the question Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy? The same percentage said he would be remembered as either outstanding or above average as a president, while 22  percent said he would be remembered as below average or poor .  |ABC_News|Abc_News|  characterized public consensus on Clinton as, You cant trust him, hes got weak morals and ethics—and hes done a heck of a good job.      In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clintons job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.  Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history. Lydia Saad, , Gallup . Frank Newport, Gallup .     In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a  |Quinnipiac_University_Polling_Institute|Quinnipiac_University_Polling_Institute|  poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind  |John_F._Kennedy|John_F._Kennedy|  and  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan| . , Quinnipiac University . The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.     A 2015 poll by  The Washington Post  asked 162 scholars of the  |American_Political_Science_Association|American_Political_Science_Association|  to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.                       As the first  |baby_boomer|Baby_Boomers|  president, Clinton was the first chief executive since  |Calvin_Coolidge|Calvin_Coolidge|  who was not alive during World War II.  Authors Martin Walker and  |Bob_Woodward|Bob_Woodward|  stated that Clintons innovative use of  |sound_bite|Sound_Bite| -ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings. Martin Walker, Clinton: the President they deserve, Fourth Estate 1999 Bob Woodward, The choice: how Clinton won, Touchstone 1996,  When Clinton played the saxophone on  The Arsenio Hall Show , he was described by some religious conservatives as the MTV president .  Opponents sometimes referred to him as Slick Willie , a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist  |Paul_Greenberg|Paul_Greenberg| ; . Retrieved May 4, 2015 Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as  |Winthrop_Rockefeller|Winthrop_Rockefeller| ,  |Dale_Bumpers|Dale_Bumpers|  and  |David_Pryor|David_Pryor| . The claim Slick Willie would last throughout his presidency.  Standing at a height of  , Clinton is tied with five others as the  |fifth-tallest_president|Heights_Of_Presidents_And_Presidential_Candidates_Of_The_United_States|  in the nations history.   His folksy manner led him to be  |nicknamed|List_Of_Nicknames_Of_United_States_Presidents| |Bubba|Bubba| , especially in the South.  Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as The Big Dog or Big Dog .   His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the  |2012_presidential_election|2012_United_States_Presidential_Election|  and his widely publicized speech at the  |2012_Democratic_National_Convention|2012_Democratic_National_Convention| , where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee  |Mitt_Romney|Mitt_Romney|  and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname Explainer-in-Chief .            Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.  In 1998,  |Nobel|Nobel_Prize|  laureate  |Toni_Morrison|Toni_Morrison|  called Clinton the first Black president , saying, Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing,  |McDonalds|Mcdonalds| -and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas .  Morrison noted that Clintons sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and  |double_standards|Double_Standard|  that, she said, blacks typically endure. Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large.  Clinton, a  |Baptist|Baptist| , Sullivan, The Party Faithful, p. 101. has been open about his faith. Sullivan, The Party Faithful, p. 9.     Shortly after Clinton took office,  |Richard_Mellon_Scaife|Richard_Mellon_Scaife| , a conservative newspaper owner, began to underwrite investigations into Clintons past, reportedly with the hope of discovering a scandal which would cost him his presidency.  Leading the  |Arkansas_Project|Arkansas_Project| , Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clintons home state of Arkansas who would be able to reveal hidden misconduct of the president. Clinton was a friend of billionaire financier  |Jeffrey_Epstein|Jeffrey_Epstein| .                     Several women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clintons sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time, because of the vast power differential between a 22-year old intern and the president of the United States. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the  |MeToo_movement|Me_Too_Movement| , with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.        In 1994,  |Paula_Jones|Paula_Jones|  initiated a  |sexual_harassment_lawsuit|Clinton_V._Jones|  against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge  |Susan_Webber_Wright|Susan_Webber_Wright|  on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.  Jones appealed Webber Wrights ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clintons admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.  In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas.  |Robert_S._Bennett|Robert_S._Bennett| , Clintons main lawyer for the case, called the filing a pack of lies and an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States funded by Clintons political enemies.  Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.  Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.  During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,  Clinton  |denied_having_sexual_relations|Lewinsky_Scandal|  with  |Monica_Lewinsky|Monica_Lewinsky| —a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.         In 1998,  |Kathleen_Willey|Kathleen_Willey|  alleged that Clinton had  |groped|Groping|  her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave false information to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.  On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an  |affidavit|Affidavit| , accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willeys account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.  An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.   |Linda_Tripps|Linda_Tripp|  grand jury testimony also differed from Willeys claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.      Also in 1998,  |Juanita_Broaddrick|Juanita_Broaddrick|  alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.  To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.  Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any unwelcome sexual advances and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition. In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.     The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clintons legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.  In the wake of the  |MeToo_movement|Me_Too_Movement|  , various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.  During the  |2018_Congressional_elections|2018_U.S._Election| , no Democratic candidate for office asked Clinton to campaign with him or her, a change that The New York Times attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.     Clinton boarded the Lolita Express, a private plane of registered sex offender  |Jeffrey_Epstein|Jeffrey_Epstein| , at least 26 times.   Flight records indicate that underage girls and young women, such as Chauntae Davies, who were told to do whatever Epstein asks, were present on the plane the majority of the times Clinton boarded the plane.    Epstein has claimed he co-founded the Clinton Foundation.  Clinton has denied knowing anything about the Lolita Express or about Jeffrey Epsteins sexual abuse, despite it being public record.                   Bill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,  and has spoken in prime time at every  |Democratic_National_Convention|Democratic_National_Convention| .          In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,   and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start .  In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the  |United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference|United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference|  in Montreal.      The  |William_J._Clinton_Presidential_Center_and_Park|William_J._Clinton_Presidential_Center_And_Park|  in  |Little_Rock,_Arkansas|Little_Rock,_Arkansas| , was dedicated in 2004.  Clinton released a best-selling autobiography,  My Life , in 2004.  In 2007, he released  Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World , which also became a  |New_York_Times_Best_Seller|The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_List|  and garnered positive reviews.         In the aftermath of the  |2004_Asian_tsunami|2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake_And_Tsunami| ,  |U.N._Secretary-General|Secretary-General_Of_The_United_Nations| |Kofi_Annan|Kofi_Annan|  appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.  After  |Hurricane_Katrina|Hurricane_Katrina| , Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.  As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a  |Super_Bowl_XXXIX|Super_Bowl_Xxxix|  pre-game show,  and traveled to the affected areas.  They also spoke together at the funeral of  |Boris_Yeltsin|Boris_Yeltsin|  in April 2007.      Based on his philanthropic worldview,  Clinton created the  |William_J._Clinton_Foundation|William_J._Clinton_Foundation|  to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative , which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The  |Clinton_Global_Initiative|Clinton_Foundation|  , begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global  |public_health|Public_Health| , poverty alleviation and religious and  |ethnic_conflict|Ethnic_Conflict| .  In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools.  Clintons foundation joined with the  |Large_Cities_Climate_Leadership_Group|Large_Cities_Climate_Leadership_Group|  in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.  The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.  In 2008, Foundation director  |Inder_Singh|Inder_Singh|  announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30  percent in developing nations.  Clinton also spoke in favor of  |California_Proposition_87|California_Proposition_87|  on  |alternative_energy|Energy_Development| , which was voted down.               During the  |2008_Democratic_presidential_primary_campaign|Democratic_Party_Presidential_Primaries,_2008| , Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10  million toward her campaign.  Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.  Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillarys staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.  Considering Bills remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.  Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obamas election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the  |2008_Democratic_National_Convention|2008_Democratic_National_Convention| , saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is ready to lead .  After Hillary Clintons presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.                In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists  |imprisoned|2009_Imprisonment_Of_American_Journalists_By_North_Korea|  there.  |Euna_Lee|Euna_Lee|  and  |Laura_Ling|Laura_Ling|  had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.   |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter|  had made a similar visit in 1994. After Clinton met with North Korean leader  |Kim_Jong-il|Kim_Jong-Il| , Kim issued a pardon.          Since then, Clinton has been assigned a number of other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations  |Special_Envoy|Special_Envoy_Of_The_Secretary-General|  to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.  Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to build back better .  In response to the  |2010_Haiti_earthquake|2010_Haiti_Earthquake| , U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haitis recovery.  Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and  |Cheryl_Mills|Cheryl_Mills|  worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the companys deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant. In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of  |NTR|Ntr_Plc| , Irelands first environmental foundation.   At the  |2012_Democratic_National_Convention|2012_Democratic_National_Convention| , Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.               During the  |2016_presidential_election|2016_United_States_Presidential_Election| , Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, including a campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina.  In a series of tweets, then-President-elect  |Donald_Trump|Donald_Trump|  criticized his ability to get people out to vote.               On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents  |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter| , George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with  |One_America_Appeal|One_America_Appeal|  to help the victims of  |Hurricane_Harvey|Hurricane_Harvey|  and  |Hurricane_Irma|Hurricane_Irma|  in the  |Gulf_Coast|Gulf_Coast_Of_The_United_States|  and  |Texas|Texas|  communities.          In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.  In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.  On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to  |NewYork–Presbyterian_Hospital|Newyork–Presbyterian_Hospital|  in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two  |coronary_stents|Coronary_Stent|  implanted in his heart.
