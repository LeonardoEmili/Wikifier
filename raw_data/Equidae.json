These early Equidae were fox-sized animals with three toes on the hind feet, and four on the front feet. They were herbivorous browsers on relatively soft plants, and already adapted for running. The complexity of their brains suggest that they already were alert and intelligent animals.  Later species reduced the number of toes, and developed teeth more suited for grinding up grasses and other tough plant food.     The family became relatively diverse during the ": null
