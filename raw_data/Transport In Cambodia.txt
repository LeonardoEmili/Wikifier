           The system of Transport in Cambodia, rudimentary at the best of times, was severely damaged in the chaos that engulfed the nation in the latter half of the 20th century. The countrys weak transport  |infrastructure|Infrastructure|  hindered emergency relief efforts, exacerbating the logistical issues of procurement of supplies in general and their distribution. Cambodia received  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  technical assistance and equipment to support the maintenance of the  |transportation_network|Transport_Network| .         |roads|Road|  and  |highways|Highway|  are hard surfaced, all-weather, and in good condition. About 50% of the roads were constructed of crushed stone,  |gravel|Gravel| , or compacted earth. Secondary roads are of unimproved earth or were little more than tracks. In 1981  |Cambodia|Cambodia|  opened a newly repaired section of National Route 1 which runs southeast from  |Phnom_Penh|Phnom_Penh|  to the Vietnamese border. The road, which suffered damage during the war years, was restored most probably by Vietnamese army engineers.     In the late-1980s, Cambodias road network was both underutilized and unable to meet even the modest demands placed upon it by an preindustrial  |agrarian_society|Agrarian_Society| . Commercial vehicles, such as trucks and  |bus|Bus| es, were insufficient in number and lacked the  |spare_parts|Auto_Part|  necessary to keep them running. Road construction and maintenance were ignored by a financially hard-pressed governments, while  |insurgents|Insurgency|  regularly destroyed  |bridges|Bridge|  and rendered some routes unsafe for travel.     Cambodia is upgrading the main highways to international standards and most are vastly improved from 2006. Most main roads are now paved. And now road construction is on going from the  |Thailand|Thailand|  border at  |Poipet|Poipet|  to  |Siem_Reap|Siem_Reap|  .     Chart of 01/2014            Motorcycles are by far the most common transport medium in Cambodia. Cyclo or  |cycle_rickshaws|Cycle_Rickshaw|  were popular in 1990s but are increasingly replaced by remorques and rickshaws imported from India. Cyclos are unique to Cambodia in that the cyclist sits behind the passenger seat, as opposed to cycle rickshaws in neighbouring countries where the cyclist is at the front and pulls the carriage. With 78% mobile phone penetration rate, ride-hailing apps have become popular in recent years. The first locally-owned ride-hailing app, ExNet taxi app, was launched in 2016, after which another locally-developed PassApp taxi was also introduced. Spiess, R. . Local ride-hailing apps stay on course. Retrieved from  The ExNet and PassApp use the same technology and architect for their application, except that ExNet is a taxi-based ride-hailing service while PassApp is more of rickshaw-based one.  |Uber|Uber|  and  |Grab|Grab|  joined the market in 2017. The entry and later merger of Uber and Grab did not negatively affect the local apps as the locals have the first-mover advantage and could secure a large number of patrons. As of today, PassApp is seen as an able competitor for the Singapore-based Grab in the Cambodian transport market.     Aside from the private-hire vehicles and ride-hailing service, public transport is also available but only in the capital. Phnom Penh city bus service started in 2015 with only three routes under the assistance of JICA. Baker, J. L. K., Natsuko; Lin, Sarah Xinyuan; Johnson, Erik Caldwell; Yin, Soriya; Ou, Narya;. . Urban Development in Phnom Penh. Retrieved from  Today, Phnom Penh City Bus operates 13 routes.          Two rail lines exist, both originating in Phnom Penh and totaling about 612 kilometers of 1,000 mm metre gauge single track.   The first line or the northern line, built by The French colonial government, running from Phnom Penh to Poipet on the Thai border, between 1930 and 1940, with Phnom Penh Railway Station opening in 1932.   The final connection with Thailand was completed by Royal State Railways in 1942. However, the service from Bangkok to Battambang was suspended when the French Indochinese Government resumed sovereignty over Battambang and the Sisophon area from Thailand on 17 December 1946, as Thailand was seen as a supporter of Khmer Issarak, the anti-French, Khmer nationalist political movement.   A third line is planned to connect Phnom Penh with Vietnam,  the last missing link of the planned rail corridor between Singapore and the city of Kunming, China. A new north-south line is also planned. The lines from Phnom Penh to Sisophon and from Sisophon to Poipet have been rehabilitated; starting with Poipet to Srey Sisophon in April of 2018 and Sisophon to Phnom Penh in early July  . The active part, the southern line, of the network is the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville line, with stops at Takeo and Kampot. The first line to be re-opened in Cambodia was the 118km long route from Phnom Penh to Touk Meas and the complete southern line in May of 2011  . Toll Royal Railway  had been given a 30 year concession from The Royal Government of Cambodia to operate Cambodias railway network.      |Phnom_Penh|Phnom_Penh|  -  |Pursat|Pursat|  -  |Moung_Ruessei|Moung_Ruessei|  -  |Battambang|Battambang|  -  |Sisophon|Sisophon|  -  |Poipet|Poipet|  Oxford World Atlas, Oxford University Press, 1973, page 65      |Phnom_Penh|Phnom_Penh|  -  |Takeo|Takéo_Province|  -  |Touk_Meas|Touk_Meas|  -  |Damnak_Changaeur|Damnak_Changaeur|  -  |Veal_Renh|Veal_Renh|  -  |Sihanoukville|Sihanoukville|   & ll12.120914078392667%2C103.71077854999999 & z8       The nations extensive inland  |waterways|Waterway|  were important historically in domestic trade.

Sihanoukville port reopened in late-1979. It had been built in 1960 with French assistance. In 1980 some 180 Soviet dockworkers, having brought with them forklifts and trucks, were reportedly working at Kampong Som as longshoremen or as instructors of unskilled Cambodian port workers. By 1984 approximately 1,500 Cambodian port workers were handling 2,500 tons of cargo per day. According to official statistics, Sihanoukville had handled only 769,500 tons in the four prior years , a level that contrasted sharply with the ports peacetime capacity of about one million tons of cargo per year.
