                 The Enola Gay  is a  |Boeing_B-29_Superfortress|Boeing_B-29_Superfortress| |bomber|Bomber| , named after Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the pilot,  |Colonel|Colonel| |Paul_Tibbets|Paul_Tibbets| . On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , piloted by Tibbets and  |Robert_A._Lewis|Robert_A._Lewis|  it became the  |first_aircraft_to_drop_an_atomic_bomb|Atomic_Bombings_Of_Hiroshima_And_Nagasaki| . The bomb, code-named  |Little_Boy|Little_Boy|  , was targeted at the city of  |Hiroshima|Hiroshima| , Japan, and caused the near-complete destruction of the city. Enola Gay participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of  |Kokura|Kokura| . Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target,  |Nagasaki|Nagasaki| , being bombed instead.     After the war, the Enola Gay returned to the United States, where it was operated from  |Roswell_Army_Air_Field|Walker_Air_Force_Base| ,  |New_Mexico|New_Mexico| . In May 1946, it was flown to  |Kwajalein|Kwajalein|  for the  |Operation_Crossroads|Operation_Crossroads| |nuclear_tests|Nuclear_Test|  in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at  |Bikini_Atoll|Bikini_Atoll| . Later that year it was transferred to the  |Smithsonian_Institution|Smithsonian_Institution| , and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonians storage facility at  |Suitland,_Maryland|Suitland,_Maryland| , in 1961.     In the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the  |National_Air_and_Space_Museum|National_Air_And_Space_Museum|  in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombings 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASMs  |Steven_F._Udvar-Hazy_Center|Steven_F._Udvar-Hazy_Center| . The last survivor of its crew,  |Theodore_Van_Kirk|Theodore_Van_Kirk| , died on 28 July 2014 at the age of 93.           The Enola Gay  was built by the  |Glenn_L._Martin_Company|Glenn_L._Martin_Company|   at its  |Bellevue,_Nebraska|Bellevue,_Nebraska| , plant, located at what is now known as  |Offutt_Air_Force_Base|Offutt_Air_Force_Base| . The bomber was one of the 15 initial examples of  |B-29s|Boeing_B-29_Superfortress|  built to the  |Silverplate|Silverplate|  specification—65 of these eventually being completed during and after World War II—giving them the primary ability to function as nuclear weapon delivery aircraft. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling, March, Peter R.

Enola Gay was personally selected by  |Colonel|Colonel| |Paul_W._Tibbets_Jr.|Paul_Tibbets| , the commander of the  |509th_Composite_Group|509Th_Composite_Group| , on 9 May 1945, while still on the  |assembly_line|Assembly_Line| . The aircraft was accepted by the  |United_States_Army_Air_Forces|United_States_Army_Air_Forces|  on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the  |393d_Bombardment_Squadron,_Heavy|393D_Bomb_Squadron| , 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by  |Captain|Captain| |Robert_A._Lewis|Robert_A._Lewis| , took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509ths base at  |Wendover_Army_Air_Field|Wendover_Army_Air_Field| ,  |Utah|Utah| , on 14 June 1945.     Thirteen days later, the aircraft left Wendover for  |Guam|Guam| , where it received a bomb-bay modification, and flew to  |North_Field|North_Field| ,  |Tinian|Tinian| , on 6 July. It was initially given the Victor number 12, but on 1 August, was given the  |circle_R_tail_markings|Usaaf_Unit_Identification_Aircraft_Markingsxxi_Bomber_Command|  of the  |6th_Bombardment_Group|6Th_Operations_Group|  as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft. During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights, and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop  |pumpkin_bombs|Pumpkin_Bomb|  on industrial targets at  |Kobe|Kobe|  and  |Nagoya|Nagoya| . Enola Gay was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission.     The partially assembled  |Little_Boy|Little_Boy| |gun-type_fission_weapon|Gun-Type_Fission_Weapon|  L-11, weighing , was contained inside a  ×  ×  wooden crate that was secured to the deck of the . Unlike the six  |uranium-235|Uranium-235|  target discs, which were later flown to Tinian on three separate aircraft arriving 28 and 29 July, the assembled projectile with the nine uranium-235 rings installed was shipped in a single lead-lined steel container weighing  that was locked to brackets welded to the deck of  |Captain|Captain| |Charles_B._McVay_IIIs|Charles_B._Mcvay_Iii|  quarters. Both the L-11 and projectile were dropped off at Tinian on 26 July 1945.             On 5 August 1945, during preparation for the first atomic mission, Tibbets assumed command of the aircraft and named it after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets, who, in turn, had been named for the heroine of  |a_novel|Enola;_Or,_Her_Fatal_Mistake| . When it came to selecting a name for the plane, Tibbets later recalled that:      The name was painted on the aircraft on 5 August by Allan L. Karl, an enlisted man in the 509th. Regularly-assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now-famous nose art.      |Hiroshima|Hiroshima|  was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from  |North_Field|North_Field| , in the  |Northern_Mariana_Islands|Northern_Mariana_Islands| , about six hours flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s,  The Great Artiste , carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called  Necessary Evil , commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project| ,  |Major_General|Major_General| |Leslie_R._Groves,_Jr.|Leslie_R._Groves,_Jr.| , wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.        After leaving Tinian, the aircraft made their way separately to  |Iwo_Jima|Iwo_Jima| , where they rendezvoused at  and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at . Captain  |William_S._Deak_Parsons|William_Sterling_Parsons|  of  |Project_Alberta|Project_Alberta| , who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff. His assistant,  |Second_Lieutenant|Second_Lieutenant| |Morris_R._Jeppson|Morris_R._Jeppson| , removed the safety devices 30 minutes before reaching the target area.      The release at 08:15 went as planned, and the Little Boy took 43 seconds to fall from the aircraft flying at  to the predetermined detonation height about  above the city. Enola Gay traveled  before it felt the shock waves from the blast.  Although buffeted by the shock, neither Enola Gay nor The Great Artiste was damaged.     The detonation created a blast equivalent to .  The U-235 weapon was  |considered_very_inefficient|Nuclear_Weapon_Designgun-Type_Assembly_Weapon| , with only 1.7% of its  |fissile_material|Fissile_Material|  reacting.  The radius of total destruction was about one mile , with resulting fires across .  Americans estimated that  of the city were destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshimas buildings were destroyed and another 6–7% damaged.  Some 70,000–80,000 people, 30% of the citys population, were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm,  and another 70,000 injured.  Out of those killed, 20,000 were soldiers.       Enola Gay returned safely to its base on Tinian to great fanfare, touching down at 2:58 pm, after 12 hours 13 minutes. The Great Artiste and Necessary Evil followed at short intervals. Several hundred people, including journalists and photographers, had gathered to watch the planes return. Tibbets was the first to disembark, and was presented with the  |Distinguished_Service_Cross|Distinguished_Service_Cross|  on the spot.       The Hiroshima mission was followed by another atomic strike. Originally scheduled for 11 August, it was brought forward by two days to 9 August owing to a forecast of bad weather. This time, a  |Fat_Man|Fat_Man|  nuclear weapon was carried by B-29  Bockscar , piloted by Major  |Charles_W._Sweeney|Charles_W._Sweeney| . Enola Gay, flown by Captain George Marquardts Crew B-10, was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for  |Kokura|Kokura| , the primary target. Enola Gay reported clear skies over Kokura, but by the time Bockscar arrived, the city was obscured by smoke from fires from the conventional bombing of  |Yahata|Yahata|  by 224 B-29s the day before. After three unsuccessful passes, Bockscar diverted to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb. In contrast to the Hiroshima mission, the Nagasaki mission has been described as tactically botched, although the mission did meet its objectives. The crew encountered a number of problems in execution, and had very little fuel by the time they landed at the emergency backup landing site  |Yontan_Airfield|Yontan_Airfield|  on  |Okinawa|Okinawa| .                   Enola Gays crew on 6 August 1945, consisted of 12 men. The crew was:     Colonel Paul W. Tibbets Jr.  – pilot and aircraft commander   Captain Robert A. Lewis  – co-pilot; Enola Gays regularly assigned aircraft commander   Major Thomas Ferebee  – bombardier   Captain Theodore Dutch Van Kirk  – navigator   Captain William S. Parsons , USN  – weaponeer and mission commander.   First Lieutenant Jacob Beser  – radar countermeasures   Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson  – assistant weaponeer   Staff Sergeant Robert Bob Caron  – tail gunner   Staff Sergeant Wyatt E. Duzenbury  – flight engineer   Sergeant Joe S. Stiborik  – radar operator   Sergeant Robert H. Shumard  – assistant flight engineer   Private First Class Richard H. Nelson  – VHF radio operator         Of mission commander Parsons, it was said: There is no one more responsible for getting this bomb out of the laboratory and into some form useful for combat operations than Captain Parsons, by his plain genius in the ordnance business.       For the Nagasaki mission, Enola Gay was flown by Crew B-10, normally assigned to  |Up_An_Atom|Up_An_Atom| Enola Gay back to the United States, arriving at the 509ths new base at Roswell Army Air Field , New Mexico , on 8 November. On 29 April 1946, Enola Gay left Roswell as part of the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific. It flew to Kwajalein Atoll on 1 May. It was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, reaching Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field , California, the next day.     The decision was made to preserve the Enola Gay, and on 24 July 1946, the aircraft was flown to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base , Tucson, Arizona , in preparation for storage. On 30 August 1946, the title to the aircraft was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution and the Enola Gay was removed from the USAAF inventory. From 1946 to 1961, the Enola Gay was put into temporary storage at a number of locations. It was at Davis-Monthan from 1 September 1946 until 3 July 1949, when it was flown to Orchard Place Air Field , Park Ridge, Illinois , by Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian. It was moved to Pyote Air Force Base , Texas, on 12 January 1952, and then to Andrews Air Force Base , Maryland, on 2 December 1953, because the Smithsonian had no storage space for the aircraft.     It was hoped that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left outdoors on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland , on 21 July 1961.     Enola Gay remained at Suitland for many years. By the early 1980s, two veterans of the 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator Barry Goldwater in their campaign. In 1983, Walter J. Boyne , a former B-52 pilot with the Strategic Air Command , became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the Enola Gays restoration a priority. Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a sad meeting. fond memories, and I dont mean the dropping of the bomb, were the numerous occasions I flew the airplane  ... I pushed it very, very hard and it never failed me  ... It was probably the most beautiful piece of machinery that any pilot ever flew.     Restoration of the bomber began on 5 December 1984, at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland-Silver Hill, Maryland . The propellers that were used on the bombing mission were later shipped to Texas A & M University . One of these propellers was trimmed to for use in the universitys Oran W. Nicks Low Speed Wind Tunnel. The lightweight aluminum variable-pitch propeller is powered by a 1,250 kVA electric motor, providing a wind speed up to . Two engines were rebuilt at Garber and two at San Diego Air & Space Museum . Some parts and instruments had been removed and could not be located. Replacements were found or fabricated, and marked so that future curators could distinguish them from the original components.           thu   Enola Gay became the center of a controversy at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The exhibit, The Crossroads: The End of World War II, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War, was drafted by the Smithsonians National Air and Space Museum staff, and arranged around the restored Enola Gay.     Critics of the planned exhibit, especially those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association , charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, rather than on the motives for the bombing or the discussion of the bombs role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. After attempts to revise the exhibit to meet the satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit , Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy. He later reflected that         The forward fuselage went on display on 28 June 1995. On 2 July 1995, three people were arrested for throwing ash and human blood on the aircrafts fuselage, following an earlier incident in which a protester had thrown red paint over the gallerys carpeting. The exhibition closed on 18 May 1998 and the fuselage was returned to the Garber Facility for final restoration.       Restoration work began in 1984, and would eventually require 300,000 staff hours. While the fuselage was on display, from 1995 to 1998, work continued on the remaining unrestored components. The aircraft was shipped in pieces to the National Air and Space Museums Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia from March–June 2003, with the fuselage and wings reunited for the first time since 1960 on 10 April 2003 and assembly completed on 8 August 2003. The aircraft has been on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center since the museum annex opened on 15 December 2003. As a result of the earlier controversy, the signage around the aircraft provided only the same succinct technical data as is provided for other aircraft in the museum, without discussion of the controversial issues. It read:   thu   The display of the Enola Gay without reference to the historical context of World War II, the Cold War, or the development and deployment of nuclear weapons aroused controversy. A petition from a group calling themselves the Committee for a National Discussion of Nuclear History and Current Policy bemoaned the display of Enola Gay as a technological achievement, which it described as an extraordinary callousness toward the victims, indifference to the deep divisions among American citizens about the propriety of these actions, and disregard for the feelings of most of the worlds peoples .  It attracted signatures from notable figures including historian  |Gar_Alperovitz|Gar_Alperovitz| , social critic  |Noam_Chomsky|Noam_Chomsky| , whistle blower  |Daniel_Ellsberg|Daniel_Ellsberg| , physicist  |Joseph_Rotblat|Joseph_Rotblat| , writer  |Kurt_Vonnegut|Kurt_Vonnegut| , producer  |Norman_Lear|Norman_Lear| , actor  |Martin_Sheen|Martin_Sheen|  and filmmaker  |Oliver_Stone|Oliver_Stone| .
