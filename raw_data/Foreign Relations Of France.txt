To keep Austria from intervening into its plans regarding Western Europe he lent limited support to the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , though the victories of  |Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince_Eugene_Of_Savoy|  destroyed these plans. William Roosen, The age of Louis XIV: the rise of modern diplomacy .

In 1869 Egyptian workers -under the supervision of France- completed the  |Suez_Canal|Suez_Canal| . A rivalry emerged between France and Britain for control of Egypt, and eventually Britain emerged victorious by buying out the Egyptian  |shares|Share|  of the company before the French had time to act.

Jan Karl Tanenbaum, France and the Arab Middle East, 1914–1920. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society : 1–50.           These colonies were granted independence after 1945, but France still tried to forge cultural and educational bonds between the areas, particularly with Lebanon. Relationships with Syria are more strained, due to the policies of that country. In 2005, France, along with the United States, pressured Syria to evacuate Lebanon. N. Méouchy et al. The British and French mandates in comparative perspectives   In the post-World War II era French relations with the Arab Middle East reached a very low point. The  |war_in_Algeria|Algerian_War_Of_Independence|  between Muslim fighters and French colonists deeply concerned the rest of the Muslim world. The Algerian fighters received much of their supplies and funding from Egypt and other Arab powers, much to Frances displeasure. Martin Alexander, and John FV Keiger. France and the Algerian War: strategy, operations and diplomacy. Journal of Strategic Studies 25.2 : 1–32.      Most damaging to Franco-Arab relations, however, was the  |Suez_Crisis|Suez_Crisis| . It greatly diminished Frances reputation in the region. France openly supported the Israeli attack on the  |Sinai_peninsula|Sinai_Peninsula| , and was working against  |Nasser|Nasser| , then a popular figure in the Middle East. The Suez Crisis also made France and the United Kingdom look again like imperialist powers attempting to impose their will upon weaker nations. Edward E. Azar, Conflict escalation and conflict reduction in an international crisis: Suez, 1956 . Journal of Conflict Resolution : 183–201. . Another hindrance to Frances relations with the Arab Middle East was its close alliance with Israel during the 1950s.       This all changed with the coming of  |Charles_de_Gaulle|Charles_De_Gaulle|  to power. De Gaulles foreign policy was centered around an attempt to limit the power and influence of both superpowers, and at the same time increase Frances international prestige. De Gaulle hoped to move France from being a follower of the United States to becoming the leading nation of a large group of non-aligned countries. The nations de Gaulle looked at as potential participants in this group were those in Frances traditional spheres of influence: Africa and the Middle East. The former French colonies in eastern and northern Africa were quite agreeable to these close relations with France. These nations had close economic and cultural ties to France, and they also had few other suitors amongst the major powers. This new orientation of French foreign policy also appealed strongly to the leaders of the Arab nations. None of them wanted to be dominated by either of the superpowers, and they supported Frances policy of trying to balance the US and the  |USSR|Soviet_Union|  and to prevent either from becoming dominant in the region. The Middle Eastern leaders wanted to be free to pursue their own goals and objectives, and did not want to be chained to either alliance block. De Gaulle hoped to use this common foundation to build strong relations between the nations. He also hoped that good relations would improve Frances trade with the region. De Gaulle also imagined that these allies would look up to the more powerful French nation, and would look to it in leadership in matters of foreign policy. Alfred Grosser, French Foreign Policy under De Gaulle     The end of the  |Algerian_conflict|Algerian_War|  in 1962 accomplished much in this regard. France could not portray itself as a leader of the oppressed nations of the world if it still was enforcing its colonial rule upon another nation. The battle against the Muslim separatists that France waged in favour of the minority of white settlers was an extremely unpopular one throughout the Muslim world. With the conflict raging it would have been close to impossible for France to have had positive relations with the nations of the Middle East. The Middle Eastern support for the  |FLN|National_Liberation_Front|  guerillas was another strain on relations that the end of the conflict removed. Most of the financial and material support for the FLN had come from the nations of the Middle East and North Africa. This was especially true of Nassers Egypt, which had long supported the separatists. Egypt is also the most direct example of improved relations after the end of hostilities. The end of the war brought an immediate thaw to Franco-Egyptian relations, Egypt ended the trial of four French officers accused of espionage, and France ended its  |trade_embargo|Trade_Embargo|  against Egypt.     In 1967 de Gaulle completely overturned Frances Israel policy. De Gaulle and his ministers reacted very harshly to Israels actions in the  |Six-Day_War|Six-Day_War| . The French government and de Gaulle condemned Israels treatment of refugees, warned that it was a mistake to occupy the  |West_Bank|West_Bank|  and  |Gaza_Strip|Gaza_Strip| , and also refused to recognize the Israeli control of  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| . The French government continued to criticize Israel after the war and de Gaulle spoke out against other Israeli actions, such as the operations against the  |Palestine_Liberation_Organization|Palestine_Liberation_Organization|  in Lebanon. France began to use its veto power to oppose Israel in the UN, and France sided with the Arab states on almost all issues brought to the international body. Most importantly of all, however, de Gaulles government imposed an arms embargo on the Israeli state. The embargo was in fact applied to all the combatants, but very soon France began selling weaponry to the Arab states again. As early as 1970 France sold Libya a hundred  |Dassault_Mirage|Dassault_Mirage|  fighter jets. However, after 1967 France continued to support Israels  |right_to_exist|Right_To_Exist| , as well as Israels many preferential agreements with France and the  |European_Economic_Community|European_Economic_Community| .       In the second half of the 20th century, France increased its expenditures in foreign aid greatly, to become second only to the United States in total aid amongst the Western powers and first on a per capita basis. By 1968 France was paying out $855  million per year in aid far more than either West Germany or the United Kingdom. The vast majority of French aid was directed towards Africa and the Middle East, usually either as a lever to promote French interests or to help with the sale of French products . France also increased its expenditures on other forms of aid sending out skilled individuals to developing countries to provide technical and cultural expertise. Robert D. McKinlay, The Aid Relationship A Foreign Policy Model and Interpretation of the Distributions of Official Bilateral Economic Aid of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, 1960–1970. Comparative Political Studies 114 pp: 411–464.     The combination of aid money, arms sales, and diplomatic alignments helped to erase the memory of the Suez Crisis and the Algerian War in the Arab world and France successfully developed amicable relationships with the governments of many of the Middle Eastern states. Nasser and de Gaulle, who shared many similarities, cooperated on limiting American power in the region. Nasser proclaimed France as the only friend of Egypt in the West. France and Iraq also developed a close relationship with business ties, joint military training exercises, and French assistance in Iraqs nuclear program in the 1970s. France improved relations with its former colony Syria, and eroded cultural links were partially restored.     In terms of trade France did receive some benefits from the improved relations with the Middle East. French trade with the Middle East increased by over fifty percent after de Gaulles reforms. The weaponry industries benefited most as France soon had lucrative contracts with many of the regimes in the Middle East and North Africa, though these contracts account for a negligible part of Frances economy.     De Gaulle had hoped that by taking a moderate path and not strongly supporting either side France could take part in the Middle East peace process between Israel and the Arab nations. Instead it has been excluded from any major role.            France plays a significant role in Africa, especially in its former  |colonies|French_Colonial_Empires| , through extensive aid programs, commercial activities, military agreements, and cultural impact. In those former colonies where the French presence remains important, France contributes to political, military, and social stability. Many think that French policy in Africa – particularly where British interests are also involved – is susceptible to what is known as  |Fashoda_syndrome|Fashoda_Syndrome| . Others have criticized the relationship as  |neocolonialism|Neocolonialism|  under the name  Françafrique , stressing Frances support of various dictatorships, among others:  |Omar_Bongo|Omar_Bongo| ,  |Idriss_Déby|Idriss_Déby| , and  |Denis_Sassou_Nguesso|Denis_Sassou_Nguesso| .
