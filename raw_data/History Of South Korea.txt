           The history of South Korea formally begins with its establishment on 15 August 1948.     Korea was administratively partitioned in 1945, at the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . As Korea was under  |Japanese_rule|Korea_Under_Japanese_Rule|  during World War II, Korea was officially a belligerent against the  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  by virtue of being Japanese territory. The unconditional  |surrender_of_Japan|Surrender_Of_Japan|  led to the  |division_of_Korea|Division_Of_Korea|  into two occupation zones , with the  |United_States|United_States| |administering_the_southern_half_of_the_peninsula|United_States_Army_Military_Government_In_Korea|  and the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| |administering_the_area_north|Soviet_Civil_Administration|  of the  |38th_parallel|38Th_Parallel_North| . This division was meant to be temporary and was first intended to return a  |unified_Korea|Korean_Reunification|  back to  |its_people|Korean_People|  after the United States,  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , Soviet Union, and  |Republic_of_china|Republic_Of_China|  could arrange a single government for the peninsula.     The two parties were unable to agree on the implementation of Joint Trusteeship over Korea. This led in 1948 to the establishment of two separate governments   the  |Communist|Communist| -aligned  |Democratic_Peoples_Republic_of_Korea|Democratic_Peoples_Republic_Of_Korea|  and the  |West|Western_Worldmodern_Political_Definition| -aligned  |First_Republic_of_Korea|First_Republic_Of_Korea|    each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. On June 25, 1950 the  |Korean_War|Korean_War|  broke out. After much destruction, the war ended on July 27, 1953 with the 1948 status quo being restored, as neither the DPRK nor the First Republic had succeeded in conquering the others portion of the divided Korea. The peninsula was divided by the  |Korean_Demilitarized_Zone|Korean_Demilitarized_Zone|  and the two separate governments  |stabilised|Division_Of_Korea|  into the existing political entities of  |North|North_Korea|  and  |South_Korea|South_Korea| .     South Koreas subsequent history is marked by alternating periods of  |democratic|Democracy|  and  |autocratic_rule|Autocratic_Rule| . Civilian governments are conventionally numbered from the  |First_Republic|First_Republic_Of_South_Korea|  of  |Syngman_Rhee|Syngman_Rhee|  to the contemporary  |Sixth_Republic|Sixth_Republic_Of_South_Korea| . The First Republic, arguably democratic at its inception, became increasingly autocratic until its collapse in 1960. The Second Republic was strongly democratic, but was overthrown in less than a year and replaced by an autocratic  |military_regime|Military_Dictatorship| . The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Republics were nominally democratic, but are widely regarded as the continuation of military rule.  With the Sixth Republic, the country has gradually stabilized into a  |liberal_democracy|Liberal_Democracy| .     Since its inception, South Korea has seen substantial development in  |education|Education_In_South_Korea| ,  |economy|Economy_Of_South_Korea| , and  |culture|Contemporary_Culture_Of_South_Korea| . Since the 1960s, the country has developed from one of Asias poorest to  |one_of_the_worlds_wealthiest_nations|Economy_Of_South_Korea| . Education, particularly at the  |tertiary|Higher_Education|  level, has expanded dramatically. It is said to be one of the  |Four_Tigers|Four_Tigers|  of rising Asian states along with  |Singapore|Singapore| ,  |Taiwan|Taiwan|  and  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong| .  , Times of Malta, 2010-02-01               Emperor  |Hirohito|Hirohito| |announced_the_surrender|Surrender_Of_Japan|  of the  |Empire_of_Japan|Empire_Of_Japan|  to the  |Allied_Powers|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  on 15 August 1945.  |General_Order_No._1|General_Order_No._1|  for the surrender of Japan prescribed separate surrender procedures for Japanese forces in Korea north and south of the 38th parallel. After  |Japans|Japan|  surrender to the Allies , division at the  |38th_parallel|38Th_Parallel_North|  marked the beginning of Soviet and U.S. occupation the North and South, respectively. This division was meant to be temporary, to be replaced by a trusteeship of the United States,  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| ,  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , and  |Republic_of_China|Republic_Of_China|  which would prepare for Korean independence. The trusteeship had been discussed at the  |Yalta_Conference|Yalta_Conference|  in February 1945. Lee Hyun-hee The Academy of Korean Studies , Lillian Goldman Law Library U.S. forces landed at  |Incheon|Incheon|  on September 8, 1945 and established a military government shortly thereafter. Lee ; Cumings . Lieutenant General  |John_R._Hodge|John_R._Hodge| , their commander, took charge of the government. Nahm, Cumings, loc. cit. Faced with mounting popular discontent, in October 1945 Hodge established the Korean Advisory Council. The  |Provisional_Government_of_the_Republic_of_Korea|Provisional_Government_Of_The_Republic_Of_Korea| , which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them.  Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed  |Peoples_Republic_of_Korea|Peoples_Republic_Of_Korea|  and its Peoples Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December.  A year later, an interim legislature and interim government were established, headed by  |Kim_Kyu-shik|Kim_Kyu-Shik|  and  |Syngman_Rhee|Syngman_Rhee|  respectively. Political and economic chaos - arising from a variety of causes - plagued the country in this period. The after-effects of the Japanese exploitation remained in the South, as in the North. Nahm ; Lee . In addition, the U.S. military was largely unprepared for the challenge of administering the country, arriving with no knowledge of the language, culture or political situation. Nahm . Thus many of their policies had unintended destabilizing effects. Waves of refugees from North Korea and returnees from abroad added to the turmoil. Lee .     In December 1945 a conference convened in  |Moscow|Moscow|  to discuss the future of Korea.    A 5-year trusteeship was discussed, and a  was established. The commission met intermittently in  |Seoul|Seoul|  but deadlocked over the issue of establishing a national government. In September 1947, with no solution in sight, the  |United_States|United_States|  submitted the Korean question to the  |UN_General_Assembly|United_Nations_General_Assembly| .     The resolution from the UN General Assembly called for a UN-supervised general election in Korea, but after the North rejected this proposition, a general election for a Constitutional Assembly took place in the South only, in May 1948. A constitution was adopted, setting forth a presidential form of government and specifying a four-year term for the presidency. According to the provisions of the Constitution, an indirect presidential election took place in July. Rhee Syngman, as head of the new assembly, assumed the presidency and proclaimed the  |Republic_of_Korea|South_Korea|  on August 15, 1948. The Academy of Korean Studies Lee Hyun-hee , Country studies: South Korea                On 15 August 1948, the Republic of Korea was formally established, with  |Syngman_Rhee|Syngman_Rhee|  as the first president. With the establishment of Rhees government,  |de_jure_sovereignty|Sovereigntydefinition_And_Types|  also passed into the new government. On September 9, 1948, a communist regime, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea , was proclaimed under  |Kim_Il-sung|Kim_Il-Sung| . However, on December 12, 1948, by its resolution 195 in the Third General Assembly, the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  recognized the  |Republic_of_Korea|South_Korea|  as the sole legal government of Korea.      In 1946, the North implemented land reforms by confiscating private property, Japanese and pro-Japanese owned facilities and factories, and placed them under state ownership. Demand for land reform in the South grew strong, and it was eventually enacted in June 1949. Koreans with large landholdings were obliged to divest most of their land. Approximately 40 percent of total farm households became small landowners. , Country studies: South Korea However, because preemptive rights were given to people who had ties with landowners before liberation, many pro-Japanese groups obtained or retained properties.     The country now divided, the relationship between the two Koreas turned more antagonistic as time passed. The Soviet forces having withdrawn in 1948, North Korea pressured the South to expel the United States forces, but Rhee sought to align his government strongly with America, and against both North Korea and Japan. Yang . Although talks towards normalization of relations with Japan took place, they achieved little. Yang . Meanwhile, the government took in vast sums of American aid, in amounts sometimes near the total size of the national budget. Cumings . The nationalist government also continued many of the practices of the U.S. military government. In 1948, the Rhee government repressed military uprisings in  |Jeju|Jeju_Uprising| ,  |Suncheon_and_Yeosu|Yeosu–Suncheon_Rebellion| . During the rebellion and its suppression 14,000 to 60,000 people were killed in all fighting.  Cumings . Of note, President Rhees regime was intolerant of opposition. A famous event that highlighted this was the arrest and conviction of future President Park Chung-hee, for communist conspiracy in 1948.     The main policy of the First Republic of South Korea was anti-communism and unification by expanding northward . The Souths military was neither sufficiently equipped nor prepared, but the Rhee administration was determined to reunify Korea by military force with aid from the United States. However, in the second parliamentary elections held on May 30, 1950, the majority of seats went to independents who did not endorse this position, confirming the lack of support and the fragile state of the nation. The Academy of Korean Studies Yang     When the communist army attacked from the North in June, retreating  |South_Korean_forces|South_Korean_Army|  executed tens of thousands suspected communists or sympathisers, either in prison or a in a reeducation movement, in what is known as the  |Bodo_League_massacre|Bodo_League_Massacre| .

With the  |Peoples_Republic_of_Chinas|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  entry on behalf of North Korea in late 1950, the fighting came to a stalemate close to the original line of demarcation. Armistice negotiations, initiated in July 1951, finally concluded on 27 July 1953  |Korean_Armistice_Agreement|S:Korean_Armistice_Agreement|  at  |Panmunjeom|Panmunjeom| , now in the  |Demilitarized_Zone|Korean_Demilitarised_Zone|  . Following the armistice, the South Korean government returned to Seoul on the symbolic date of 15 August 1953. , Country studies: South Korea     After the armistice, South Korea experienced political turmoil under years of autocratic leadership of  |Syngman_Rhee|Syngman_Rhee| , which was ended by student revolt in 1960. Throughout his rule, Rhee sought to take additional steps to cement his control of government. These began in 1952, when the government was still based in  |Busan|Busan|  due to the ongoing war. In May of that year, Rhee pushed through constitutional amendments which made the presidency a directly-elected position. To do this, he declared martial law, arrested opposing members of parliament, demonstrators, and anti-government groups. Rhee was subsequently elected by a wide margin.   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|  Lee Hyun-hee The Academy of Korean Studies     Rhee regained control of parliament in the  |1954_election|Elections_In_South_Korea1954_Legislative_Election| , and thereupon pushed through an amendment to exempt himself from the eight-year term limit, and was once again re-elected in 1956. Institute of Historical Studies Soon after, Rhees administration arrested members of the opposing party and executed the leader after accusing him of being a North Korean spy.   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|      The administration became increasingly repressive while dominating the political arena, and in 1958, it sought to amend the  |National_Security_Law|National_Security_Act|  to tighten government control over all levels of administration, including the local units. These measures caused much outrage among the people, but despite public outcry, Rhees administration rigged the  |March_1960_presidential_election|March_1960_South_Korean_Presidential_Election|  and won by a landslide. The Academy of Korean Studies     On that election day, protests by students and citizens against the irregularities of the election burst out in the city of  |Masan|Masan| . Initially these protests were quelled with force by local police, but when the body of a student was found floating in the harbor of Masan, the whole country was enraged and protests spread nationwide.   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|  On 19 April, students from various universities and schools rallied and marched in protest in the Seoul streets, in what would be called the  |April_Revolution|April_Revolution| . The government declared martial law, called in the army, and suppressed the crowds with open fire. Lee Hyun-hee   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|  Subsequent protests throughout the country shook the government, and after an escalated protest with university professors taking to the streets on April 25, Rhee submitted his official resignation on April 26 and fled into exile.          After the student revolution, power was briefly held by an interim administration under the Foreign Minister  |Heo_Jeong|Heo_Jeong| . Yonhap . A new parliamentary election was held on July 29, 1960. The Democratic Party, which had been in the opposition during the First Republic, easily gained power and the Second Republic was established. The revised constitution dictated the Second Republic to take the form of a parliamentary cabinet system where the President took only a nominal role. This was the first and the only instance South Korea turned to a parliamentary cabinet system instead of a presidential system.   at Naver dictionary The assembly elected  |Yun_Bo-seon|Yun_Bo-Seon|  as President and  |Chang_Myon|Chang_Myon|  as the Prime Minister and head of government in August, 1960. Lee Hyun-hee   , South Korea: A Country Study     The Second Republic saw the proliferation of political activity which had been repressed under the Rhee regime. Much of this activity was from leftist and student groups, which had been instrumental in the overthrow of the First Republic. Union membership and activity grew rapidly during the later months of 1960, including the Teachers Union, Journalists Union, and the Federation of Korean Trade Union. The Academy of Korean Studies Yang ; Nahm ; Yonhap Around 2,000 demonstrations were held during the eight months of the Second Republic. Yang . Nahm gives 2,000.     Under pressure from the left, the Chang government carried out a series of purges of military and police officials who had been involved in anti-democratic activities or corruption.

Nahm .   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|  40,000 people were placed under investigation; of these, more than 2,200 government officials and 4,000 police officers were purged. In addition, the government considered reducing the size of the army by 100,000, although this plan was shelved. Nahm, loc. cit.     In economic terms as well, the government was faced with mounting instability. The government formulated a  |Five-Year_Economic_Development_Plan|Five-Year_Plans_Of_South_Korea| , although it was unable to act on it prior to being overthrown. Nahm ; Yonhap The Second Republic saw the  hwan  lose half of its value against the dollar between fall 1960 and spring 1961. Nahm     Although the government had been established with support of the people, it had failed to implement effective reforms which brought about endless social unrest, political turmoil and ultimately, the  |May_16_coup|May_16_Coup| .             The  |May_16_coup|May_16_Coup| , led by Major General  |Park_Chung-hee|Park_Chung-Hee|  on May 16, 1961, put an effective end to the Second Republic. Park was one of a group of military leaders who had been pushing for the de-politicization of the military. Dissatisfied with the cleanup measures undertaken by the Second Republic and convinced that the current disoriented state would collapse into communism, they chose to take matters into their own hands. Lee Hyun-hee The Academy of Korean Studies   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|      The National Assembly was dissolved and military officers replaced the civilian officials. In May 1961, the  |junta|Military_Junta|  declared Pledges of the Revolution : anticommunism was to be the nations main policy; friendly relations would be strengthened with allies of the free world, notably the United States; all corruption and government misdeed would be disposed and fresh and clean morality would be introduced; the reconstruction of a self-reliant economy would be priority; the nations ability would be nurtured to fight against communism and achieve reunification; and that government would be returned to a democratic civilian government within two years. , South Korea: A Country Study     As a means to check the opposition, the military authority created the  |Korean_Central_Intelligence_Agency|Korean_Central_Intelligence_Agency|  in June 1961, with  |Kim_Jong-pil|Kim_Jong-Pil| , a relative of Park, as its first director.   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|  In December 1962, a referendum was held on returning to a presidential system of rule, which was allegedly passed with a 78% majority. Yonhap . Park and the other military leaders pledged not to run for office in the next elections. However, Park became presidential candidate of the new  |Democratic_Republican_Party|Democratic_Republican_Party|  , which consisted of mainly KCIA officials, ran for president and won the  |election_of_1963|1963_South_Korean_Presidential_Election|  by a narrow margin.            Parks administration started the Third Republic by announcing the  |Five-Year_Economic_Development_Plan|Five-Year_Plans_Of_South_Korea| , an  |export-oriented_industrialization|Export-Oriented_Industrialization|  policy. Top priority was placed on the growth of a self-reliant economy and modernization; Development First, Unification Later became the slogan of the times and the economy grew rapidly with vast improvement in industrial structure, especially in the basic and heavy chemical industries. Lee Hyun-hee   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|  Capital was needed for such development, so the Park regime used the influx of foreign aid from Japan and the United States to provide loans to export businesses, with preferential treatment in obtaining low-interest bank loans and tax benefits. Cooperating with the government, these businesses would later become the  chaebol . , Country studies: South Korea     Relations with Japan were normalized by the  |Korea-Japan_treaty|Treaty_On_Basic_Relations_Between_Japan_And_The_Republic_Of_Korea|  ratified in June 1965. Cumings .   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia|  This treaty brought Japanese funds in the form of loans and compensation for the damages suffered during the colonial era without an official apology from the Japanese government, sparking much protest across the nation.      The government also kept close ties with the United States, and continued to receive large amounts of aid. A  |status_of_forces_agreement|Status_Of_Forces_Agreement|  was concluded in 1966, clarifying the legal situation of the US forces stationed there. Kim Dangtaek  , United States Forces Korea Soon thereafter, Korea joined the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| , eventually sending a total of 300,000 soldiers from 1964 to 1973 to fight alongside  |US_troops|Macv|  and  |South_Vietnamese_Armed_Forces|Republic_Of_Vietnam_Military_Forces| . Nahm     Economic and technological growth during this period improved the standard for living, which expanded opportunities for education. Workers with higher education were absorbed by the rapidly growing industrial and commercial sectors, and urban population surged. , Country studies: South Korea Construction of the  |Gyeongbu_Expressway|Gyeongbu_Expressway|  was completed and linked Seoul to the nations southeastern region and the port cities of  |Incheon|Incheon|  and  |Busan|Busan| . Despite the immense economic growth, however, the standard of living for city laborers and farmers was still low. Laborers were working with low wages to increase the price competitiveness for the export-oriented economy plan, and farmers were in near poverty as the government controlled prices. The Academy of Korean Studies As the rural economy steadily lost ground and caused dissent among the farmers, however, the government decided to implement measures to increase farm productivity and income by instituting the  |Saemaul_Movement|New_Community_Movement|  in 1971. The movements goal was to improve the quality of rural life, modernize both rural and urban societies and narrow the income gap between them. Lee Hyun-hee     Park ran again in the  |1967_presidential_election|1967_South_Korean_Presidential_Election| , taking 51.4% of the vote. At the time the presidency was constitutionally limited to two terms, but a  |constitutional_amendment|Constitutional_Amendment|  was forced through the National Assembly in 1969 to allow him to seek a third term. The Academy of Korean Studies Nahm ; Yonhap, loc. cit. Major protests and demonstrations against the constitutional amendment broke out, with large support gaining for the opposition leader  |Kim_Dae-jung|Kim_Dae-Jung| , but Park was again re-elected in the  |1971_presidential_election|1971_South_Korean_Presidential_Election| . Nahm ;     Parliamentary elections followed shortly after the presidential election where the opposition party garnered most of the seats, giving them the power to pass constitutional amendments. Park, feeling threatened, declared a state of national emergency on December 6, 1971. In the midst of this domestic insecurity, the  |Nixon_Doctrine|Nixon_Doctrine|  had eased tensions among the world superpowers on the international scene, which caused a dilemma for Park, who had justified his regime based on the state policy of anti-communism. In a sudden gesture, the government proclaimed a joint communiqué for reunification with North Korea on July 4, 1972, and held  |Red_Cross|Red_Cross|  talks in Seoul and  |Pyongyang|Pyongyang| . However, there was no change in government policy regarding reunification, and on October 17, 1972, Park declared  |martial_law|Martial_Law| , dissolving the National Assembly and suspending the constitution. The Academy of Korean Studies             The Fourth Republic began with the adoption of the  |Yushin_Constitution|Yushin_Constitution|  on November 21, 1972. This new constitution gave Park effective control over the parliament and the possibility of permanent presidency. The president would be elected through indirect election by an elected body, and the term of presidency was extended to six years with no restrictions on reappointment. The legislature and judiciary were controlled by the government, and educational guidelines were under direct surveillance as well. Textbooks supporting the ideology of the military government were authorized by the government, diminishing the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education.     Despite social and political unrest, the economy continued to flourish under the authoritarian rule with the export-based industrialization policy. The first two five-year economic development plans were successful, and the 3rd and 4th  |five-year_plans|Five-Year_Plans_Of_South_Korea|  focused on expanding the heavy and chemical industries, raising the capability for steel production and oil refining. However, large conglomerate  chaebols  continuously received preferential treatment and came to dominate the domestic market. As most of the development had come from foreign capital, most of the profit went back to repaying the loans and interest.     Students and activists for democracy continued their demonstrations and protests for the abolition of the Yushin system and in the face of continuing popular unrest, Parks administration promulgated emergency decrees in 1974 and 1975, which led to the jailing of hundreds of dissidents. The protests grew larger and stronger, with politicians, intellectuals, religious leaders, laborers and farmers all joining in the movement for democracy. In 1978, Park was elected to another term by indirect election, which was met with more demonstrations and protests. The government retaliated by removing the opposition leader  |Kim_Young-sam|Kim_Young-Sam|  from the assembly and suppressing the activists with violent means. In 1979, mass anti-government demonstrations occurred nationwide, in the midst of this political turmoil, Park Chung-hee was assassinated by the director of the  |KCIA|Kcia| ,  |Kim_Jae-gyu|Kim_Jae-Gyu| , thus bringing the 18-year rule of military regime to an end. , Country studies: South Korea             After the  |assassination_of_Park_Chung-hee|Park_Chung-Hee_Assassination| , Prime Minister  |Choi_Kyu-hah|Choi_Kyu-Hah|  took the presidents role only to be usurped 6 days later by Major General  |Chun_Doo-hwans|Chun_Doo-Hwan|  1979  |Coup_détat_of_December_Twelfth|Coup_Détat_Of_December_Twelfth| . In May of the following year, a vocal civil society composed primarily of university students and labour unions led strong protests against authoritarian rule all over the country. Chun Doo-hwan declared martial law on May 17, 1980, and protests escalated. Political opponents  |Kim_Dae-jung|Kim_Dae-Jung|  and  |Kim_Jong-pil|Kim_Jong-Pil|  were arrested, and  |Kim_Young-sam|Kim_Young-Sam|  was confined to house arrest. Lee Hyun-hee     On May 18, 1980, a confrontation broke out in the city of  |Gwangju|Gwangju|  between protesting students of  |Chonnam_National_University|Chonnam_National_University|  and the armed forces dispatched by the Martial Law Command. The incident turned into a citywide protest that lasted nine days until May 27 and resulted in the  |Gwangju_massacre|Gwangju_Massacre| . Immediate estimates of the civilian death toll ranged from a few dozen to 2000, with a later full investigation by the civilian government finding nearly 200 deaths and 850 injured. , South Korea: A Country Study   at  |Doosan_Encyclopedia|Doosan_Encyclopedia| . Originally called Gwangju Uprising, the event has officially been named as the 5.18 Pro-Democracy Movement or Gwangju Pro-Democracy Movement since 1995. The Academy of Korean Studies In June 1980, Chun ordered the National Assembly to be dissolved. He subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee, and installed himself as a member. On 17 July, he resigned his position of KCIA Director, and then held only the position of committee member. In September 1980, President Choi Kyu-hah was forced to resign from president to give way to the new military leader, Chun Doo-hwan.     In September of that year, Chun was elected president by  |indirect_election|Indirect_Election|  and inaugurated in March of the following year, officially starting the Fifth Republic. A new Constitution was established with notable changes; maintaining the presidential system but limiting it to a single 7-year term, strengthening the authority of the National Assembly, and conferring the responsibilities of appointing judiciary to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. However, the system of indirect election of the president stayed and many military persons were appointed to highly ranked government positions, keeping the remnants of the Yushin era.       The government promised a new era of economic growth and democratic justice. Tight monetary laws and low interest rates contributed to price stability and helped the economy boom with notable growth in the electronics, semi-conductor, and automobile industries. The country opened up to foreign investments and GDP rose as Korean exports increased. This rapid economic growth, however, widened the gap between the rich and the poor, the urban and rural regions, and also exacerbated inter-regional conflicts. These dissensions, added to the hard-line measures taken against opposition to the government, fed intense rural and student movements, which had continued since the beginning of the republic.     In foreign policy, ties with Japan were strengthened by state visits by Chun to Japan and Japanese Prime Minister  |Yasuhiro_Nakasone|Nakasone_Yasuhiro|  to Korea. U.S. President  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan|  also paid a visit, and relations with the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  and  |China|China|  improved.  The relationship with North Korea was strained when in 1983  |a_terrorist_bomb_attack_in_Burma|Rangoon_Bombing|  killed 17 high-ranking officials attending memorial ceremonies and North Korea was alleged to be behind the attacks. However, in 1980 North Korea had submitted a one nation, two system reunification proposal which was met with a suggestion from the South to meet and prepare a unification constitution and government through a referendum. The humanitarian issue of reuniting separated families was dealt with first, and in September 1985, families from both sides of the border made cross visits to  |Seoul|Seoul|  and  |Pyongyang|Pyongyang|  in an historic event. The government made many efforts for cultural development: the  |National_Museum_of_Korea|National_Museum_Of_Korea| ,  |Seoul_Arts_Center|Seoul_Arts_Center| , and  |National_Museum_of_Contemporary_Art|List_Of_Museums_In_South_Korea|  were all constructed during this time. The  |1986_Asian_Games|1986_Asian_Games|  were held successfully, and the bid for the  |1988_Summer_Olympics|1988_Summer_Olympics|  in Seoul was successful as well.     Despite economic growth and success in diplomatic relations, the government that gained power by  |coup_detat|Coup_Detat|  was essentially a military regime and the publics support and trust in it was low when the promises for democratic reform never materialized. In the 1985 National Assembly elections, opposition parties won more votes than the government party, clearly indicating that the public wanted a change.  Many started to sympathize with the protesting students. The  |Gwangju_massacre|Gwangju_Democratization_Movement|  was never forgotten and in January 1987, when a protesting  |Seoul_National_University|Seoul_National_University|  student died under police interrogation, public fury was immense. In April 1987, President Chun made a declaration that measures would be taken to protect the current constitution, instead of reforming it to allow for the direct election of the president. This announcement consolidated and strengthened the opposition; in June 1987, more than a million students and citizens participated in the nationwide anti-government protests of the  |June_Democracy_Movement|June_Democracy_Movement| .

In October 1987 a revised Constitution was approved by a national referendum and direct elections for a new president were held in December, bringing the Fifth Republic to a close.        The Sixth Republic was established in 1987 and remains the current republic of South Korea.             |Roh_Tae-woo|Roh_Tae-Woo|  became president for the 13th presidential term in the first direct presidential election in 16 years. Although Roh was from a military background and one of the leaders of  |Chuns_coup_détat|Coup_Détat_Of_December_Twelfth| , the inability of the opposition leaders  |Kim_Dae-jung|Kim_Dae-Jung|  and  |Kim_Young-sam|Kim_Young-Sam|  to agree on a unified candidacy, led to his being elected. Lee Hyun-hee The Academy of Korean Studies The first female presidential candidate,  |Hong_Sook-ja|Hong_Sook-Ja| , even withdrew from the race in order to back Kim Young-sam against Roh.  Roh was officially inaugurated in February 1988. The government set out to eliminate past vestiges of authoritarian rule, by revising laws and decrees to fit democratic provisions. Freedom of the press was expanded, university autonomy recognised, and restrictions on overseas travels were lifted. Robert E. Bedeski However, the growth of the economy had slowed down compared to the 1980s, with strong labor unions and higher wages reducing the competitiveness of Korean products on the international market, resulting in stagnant exports, while commodity prices kept on rising.     Shortly after Rohs inauguration, the  |Seoul_Olympics|1988_Summer_Olympics|  took place, raising South Koreas international recognition and also greatly influencing foreign policy. Rohs government announced the official unification plan,  Nordpolitik , and established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, China, and countries in  |East_Europe|East_Europe| .     A historic event was held in 1990 when North Korea accepted the proposal for exchange between the two Koreas, resulting in high-level talks, and cultural and sports exchanges.

Local government elections were held in 1995, and parliamentary elections in 1996. In a response to popular demand, former presidents Chun and Roh were both indicted on charges linked to bribery, illegal funds, and in the case of Chun, responsibility for the  |Gwangju_massacre|Gwangju_Democratization_Movement| .

Tensions varied between the two Koreas thereafter, with cycles of small military skirmishes and apologies. The government also carried out substantial financial and economical reforms, joining the  |OECD|Oecd|  in 1996, but encountered difficulties with political and financial scandals involving his son. The country also faced a variety of catastrophes which claimed many lives: a train collision and a ship sinking in 1993, and the  |Seongsu_Bridge|Seongsu_Bridge|  and  |Sampoong_Department_Store_collapses|Sampoong_Department_Store_Collapse|  in 1994 and 1995. These incidents were a blow to the civilian government.     In 1997, the nation suffered a  |severe_financial_crisis|Asian_Financial_Crisis| , and the government approached the  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund|  for relief funds. This was the limit to what the nation could bear and led to the opposition leader  |Kim_Dae-jung|Kim_Dae-Jung|  winning the presidency in the same year. This is the first time an opposition candidate won the presidency.               In February 1998, Kim Dae-jung was officially inaugurated. South Korea had maintained its commitment to democratize its political processes and this was the first transfer of the government between parties by peaceful means. Kims government faced the daunting task of overcoming the economic crisis, but with the joint efforts of the governments aggressive pursuit of foreign investment, cooperation from the industrial sector, and the citizens gold-collecting campaign, the country was able to come out of the crisis in a relatively short period of time. , BBC News, 1998-01-14.
