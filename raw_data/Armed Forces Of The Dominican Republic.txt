The armed forces participate fully in counter- |illegal_drug_trade|Illegal_Drug_Trade|  efforts, for this task, there is a taskforce known as DEPROSER 24/7 . They also are active in efforts to control  |contraband|Contraband|  and  |illegal_immigration|Illegal_Immigration|  from  |Haiti|Haiti|  to the Dominican Republic and from the Dominican Republic to the  |United_States|United_States|  .                Haiti under their president Jean-Pierre Boyer had invaded and occupied Dominican Republic from 1822 to 1844. The military forces of the First Republics army comprised about 4,000 soldiers organized into seven line infantry regiments, several loose battalions, 6 escudrones  |cavalry|Cavalry|  and 3  |artillery|Artillery|  brigades with 2/2 brigades; This army was supplemented with national civic guard militia composed of the provinces, the National Naval Armada, original name of the Navy today; It composed of 10 ships, seven owned and 3 taken in requición and armed by the government: the  |Cibao|Cibao|  frigate with 20 cannons; the brigantine  |schooner|Schooner|  San Jose, five guns; the schooner La Libertad, five guns; General schooner Santana 7 guns; the schooner La Merced, five guns; Separation schooner, 3 guns; the schooner February 27, five guns.

These men were skilled in handling machete and spear. His deputy commander was Brigadier General Antonio Duvergé. The other expeditionary army was the Northern Borders created to defend these borders: its commander was Major General Francisco A. Salcedo.     The Dominican forces would reach levels of organization and efficiency of considerable notoriety. As an example of this, it would suffice to highlight the fact of the achievement and preservation of National Independence, with the Dominican victory over repeated Haitian military invasions in the 12-year period that followed the proclamation of Independence; In addition, 55 percent of the National Budget was allocated to it.            The events that led to the  |United_States|United_States|  military intervention of 1916, brought about the disappearance of any vestige of military structure in the  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic| , setting the intervening forces a military government headed by Captain William Knapp, who make an interim police force called Constabulary equivalent to an armed police force as a military unit and he had the task of maintaining internal order and enforce the implementing provisions of the US government. This body, purely police function disappears in 1917, leading to the creation of a National Guard. As a result of this historic event of our recent past, the country inherited a hierarchical and organizational akin to the US Marine Corps structure, which served as a platform to the transformations that later gave rise to the armed forces we know today, made up of three components, terrestrial one, one naval and one air.     This land component, now called the National Army, inherited by both its organizational structure of the National Guard organized by the US occupation forces, which operated from April 7, 1917 until June 1921, when it becomes Dominican National Police by Executive Order No. 631 of Rear Admiral Thomas Snowden, who was at that time the military governor of  |Santo_Domingo|Santo_Domingo| . After the US military occupation in 1924,  |Horacio_Vásquez|Horacio_Vásquez|  wins the presidential elections of that same year. Among his first decisions, decrees the change of the Dominican National Police in National Brigade, a situation that continues until 17 May 1928, when new turn changes the name of the Army by Law No. 928, but basically inheriting a structure Police, who obeyed schemes imposition of public order demanded by the country at that time and not those of an army in their typical roles.     Due to its characteristics and missions, organizational structure that demanded presence throughout the country, which was realized with the creation of posts and detachments in different parts of the country and the establishment in some provinces of company size units, many of which still Army retains today. Over the years and already existing National Police created by decree No. 1523 of March 2, 1936 of  |President_Trujillo|Rafael_Trujillo| , many of these units, posts and detachments became part of it, perfectly adapted to its structure, since These were essentially created to play a policing role. So great was the influence that had the National Guard in Dominican society and very particularly in the rural population, which even today are many Dominicans who often referred to the Armed Forces and unique way to the Army as The Guard .     Meanwhile, the  |Navy|Navy|  has remained since its inception attached to the principles that gave rise, assuming only two name changes since its inception, but gradually evolving the transformation of what was a body created for military purposes, capable of landing and ships with weapons to face possible naval invasions, to be a component mainly responsible for enforcing the provisions on navigation, trade and fishing, as well as international treaties     The Dominican Air Force, meanwhile, emerges as an independent component in 1948, under the chairmanship of Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujillo Molina, with characteristics of innovation and modernism, which gave mobility, versatility and depth to the  |Armed_Forces|Armed_Forces| .
