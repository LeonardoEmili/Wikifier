My suggestion is cryptid, meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown ... describing those creatures which are subjects of cryptozoological investigation. Wall, J. E. : The Spring, 1983, issue featured an interview with Paul LeBlond and Forrest Wood, in which it was suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like monster. My suggestion is cryptid, meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown. As far as I know, this would be an entirely new word, describing those creatures which are subjects of cryptozoological investigation.

While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids . Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.     Few cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology.

Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon. Campion-Vincent .     Campion-Vincent says that four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances : Forteans , occultists , folklorists , and cryptozoologists .
