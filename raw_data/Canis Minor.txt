           Canis Minor  is a small  |constellation|Constellation|  in the  |northern_celestial_hemisphere|Celestial_Sphere| . In the second century, it was included as an  |asterism|Asterism| , or pattern, of two stars in  |Ptolemys|Ptolemy|  48 constellations, and it is counted among the  |88_modern_constellations|List_Of_Constellations| . Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for lesser dog , in contrast to  |Canis_Major|Canis_Major| , the greater dog ; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of  |Orion|Orion|  the hunter.     Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth  |magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude| ,  |Procyon|Procyon|  , with a magnitude of 0.34, and  |Gomeisa|Gomeisa|  , with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellations dimmer stars were noted by  |Johann_Bayer|Johann_Bayer| , who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and  |John_Flamsteed|John_Flamsteed| , who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh- |brightest_star|List_Of_Brightest_Stars|  in the night sky, as well as one of the  |closest|List_Of_Nearest_Stars| . A yellow-white  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  star, it has a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf| |_companion|Binary_Star| . Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star.  |Luytens_Star|Luytens_Star|  is a ninth-magnitude  |red_dwarf|Red_Dwarf|  and the  |Solar_Systems|Solar_System|  next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude  |HD_66141|Hd_66141| , which has evolved into an orange  |giant|Giant_Star|  towards the end of its  |life_cycle|Stellar_Evolution| , was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint  |deep_sky_objects|Deep_Sky_Object|  within the constellations borders. The 11  |Canis_Minorids|Canis_Minorids|  are a  |meteor_shower|Meteor_Shower|  that can be seen in early December.          Though strongly associated with the  |Classical_Greek|Classical_Greece| |_uranographic|Celestial_Cartography|  tradition, Canis Minor originates from ancient  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| . Procyon and Gomeisa were called MASH.TAB.BA or twins in the  Three Stars Each  tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later  MUL.APIN , this name was also applied to the pairs of  |Pi_3_|Pi3_Orionis|  and  |Pi_4_Orionis|Pi4_Orionis|  and  |Zeta|Zeta_Geminorum|  and  |Xi_Orionis|Xi_Orionis| . The meaning of MASH.TAB.BA evolved as well, becoming the twin deities  |Lulal|Lulal|  and  |Latarak|Latarak| , who are on the opposite side of the sky from  Papsukal , the True Shepherd of Heaven in  |Babylonian_mythology|Babylonian_Mythology| . Canis Minor was also given the name DAR.LUGAL, its position defined as the star which stands behind it , in the MUL.APIN; the constellation represents a  |rooster|Rooster| . This name may have also referred to the constellation  |Lepus|Lepus| .  DAR.LUGAL was also denoted DAR.MUŠEN and DAR.LUGAL.MUŠEN in Babylonia. Canis Minor was then called tarlugallu in  |Akkadian_astronomy|Akkadian_Astronomy| .      Canis Minor was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  in his second-century  |Almagest|Almagest| , in which it was defined as a specific pattern  of stars; Ptolemy identified only two stars and hence no depiction was possible. The  |Ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greek|  called the constellation προκυων/Procyon, coming before the dog , transliterated into  |Latin|Latin|  as Antecanis, Praecanis, or variations thereof, by Cicero and others. Roman writers also appended the descriptors parvus, minor or minusculus , septentrionalis , primus or sinister to its name Canis.    In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Canis Minor was sometimes connected with the  |Teumessian_Fox|Teumessian_Fox| , a beast turned into stone with its hunter,  |Laelaps|Laelaps| , by  |Zeus|Zeus| , who placed them in heaven as Canis Major and Canis Minor . Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3,192.   |Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes|  accompanied the Little Dog with Orion, while  |Hyginus|Gaius_Julius_Hyginus|  linked the constellation with  |Maera|Maera| , a dog owned by  |Icarius_of_Athens|Icariusicarius_Of_Athens| .  On discovering the latters death, the dog and Icarius daughter  |Erigone|Erigone|  took their lives and all three were placed in the sky—Erigone as  |Virgo|Virgo|  and Icarius as  |Boötes|Boötes| .  As a reward for his faithfulness, the dog was placed along the banks of the Milky Way, which the ancients believed to be a heavenly river, where he would never suffer from thirst. Mark R. Chartrand III Skyguide: A Field Guide for Amateur Astronomers, p. 126 .     The  |medieval_Arabic_astronomers|Astronomy_In_Medieval_Islam|  maintained the depiction of Canis Minor  as a dog; in his  |Book_of_the_Fixed_Stars|Book_Of_The_Fixed_Stars| ,  |Abd_al_Rahman_al_Sufi|Abd_Al_Rahman_Al_Sufi|  included a diagram of the constellation with a canine figure superimposed.   There was one slight difference between the Ptolemaic vision of Canis Minor and the Arabic; al-Sufi claims  |Mirzam|Mirzam| , now assigned to  |Orion|Orion| , as part of both Canis Minor—the collar of the dog—and its modern home. The Arabic names for both Procyon and Gomeisa alluded to their proximity and resemblance to Sirius, though they were not direct translations of the Greek; Procyon was called ash-Shira ash-Shamiya, the Syrian Sirius and Gomeisa was called ash-Shira al-Ghamisa, the Sirius with bleary eyes. Among the  |Merazig|Merazig|  of  |Tunisia|Tunisia| , shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called Merzem, includes the stars of Canis Minor and Canis Major and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.      The ancient Egyptians thought of this constellation as  |Anubis|Anubis| , the jackal god. Chartrand, p. 126.      Alternative names have been proposed:  |Johann_Bayer|Johann_Bayer|  in the early 17th century termed the constellation Fovea The Pit , and Morus  |Sycamine|Sycamine|  Tree . Seventeenth-century German poet and author  |Philippus_Caesius|Philipp_Von_Zesen|  linked it to the dog of Tobias from the  |Apocrypha|Biblical_Apocrypha| .  |Richard_A_Proctor|Richard_A_Proctor|  gave the constellation the name Felis the Cat in 1870 , explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on  |celestial_charts|Star_Chart| .  Occasionally, Canis Minor is confused with Canis Major and given the name Canis Orionis .          In  |Chinese_astronomy|Chinese_Astronomy| , the stars corresponding to Canis Minor lie in the  |Vermilion_Bird_of_the_South|Vermilion_Bird|  . Procyon, Gomeisa and Eta Canis Minoris form an  |asterism|Asterism|  known as Nánhé, the Southern River.  With its counterpart, the Northern River Beihe , Nánhé was also associated with a gate or sentry. Along with  |Zeta|Zeta_Cancri|  and  |8_Cancri|8_Cancri| ,  |6_Canis_Minoris|6_Canis_Minoris|  and  |11_Canis_Minoris|11_Canis_Minoris|  formed the asterism Shuiwei, which literally means water level . Combined with additional stars in  |Gemini|Gemini| , Shuiwei represented an official who managed floodwaters or a marker of the water level. Neighboring Korea recognized four stars in Canis Minor as part of a different constellation, the position of the water . This constellation was located in the Red Bird, the southern portion of the sky.       |Polynesian_peoples|Polynesian_People|  often did not recognize Canis Minor as a constellation, but they saw Procyon as significant and often named it; in the  |Tuamotu_Archipelago|Tuamotu_Archipelago|  it was known as Hiro, meaning twist as a thread of coconut fiber , and Kopu-nui-o-Hiro , which was either a name for the modern figure of Canis Minor or an alternative name for Procyon. Other names included Vena , on  |Mangaia|Mangaia|  and Puanga-hori , in  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| . In the  |Society_Islands|Society_Islands| , Procyon was called Ana-tahua-vahine-o-toa-te-manava, literally Aster the priestess of brave heart , figuratively the pillar for elocution .   The  |Wardaman_people|Wardaman_People|  of the  |Northern_Territory|Northern_Territory|  in Australia gave Procyon and Gomeisa the names Magum and Gurumana, describing them as humans who were transformed into  |gum_trees|Eucalyptus|  in the  |dreamtime|Dreamtime| . Although their skin had turned to bark, they were able to speak with a human voice by rustling their leaves.      The  |Aztec_calendar|Aztec_Calendar|  was related to  |their_cosmology|Aztec_Astronomy| . The stars of Canis Minor were incorporated along with some stars of Orion and Gemini into an asterism associated with the day called Water .        Lying directly south of  |Geminis|Gemini|  bright stars  |Castor|Castor|  and  |Pollux|Pollux| ,  Canis Minor is a small constellation bordered by  |Monoceros|Monoceros|  to the south, Gemini to the north,  |Cancer|Cancer|  to the northeast, and  |Hydra|Hydra|  to the east. It does not border  |Canis_Major|Canis_Major| ; Monoceros is in between the two. Covering 183 square degrees, Canis Minor ranks seventy-first of the 88 constellations in size. It appears prominently in the southern sky during the  |Northern_Hemispheres|Northern_Hemisphere|  winter.  The constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between  and .  Most visible in the evening sky from January to March,  Canis Minor is most prominent at 10 PM during mid-February.  It is then seen earlier in the evening until July, when it is only visible after sunset before setting itself, and rising in the morning sky before dawn.  The constellations three-letter abbreviation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is CMi .                    Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than fourth  |magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude| . At magnitude 0.34,   |Procyon|Procyon| , or Alpha Canis Minoris, is the seventh- |brightest_star|List_Of_Brightest_Stars|  in the night sky, as well as one of the  |closest|List_Of_Nearest_Stars| . Its name means before the dog or preceding the dog in Greek, as it rises an hour before the Dog Star ,  |Sirius|Sirius| , of  |Canis_Major|Canis_Major| . It is a  |binary_star|Binary_Star|  system, consisting of a yellow-white  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  star  of  |spectral_type|Spectral_Type|  F5  IV-V, named Procyon  A, and a faint  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf|  companion of spectral type DA, named Procyon  B. Procyon  B, which orbits the more massive star every 41 years, is of magnitude 10.7. Procyon  A is 1.4 times the  |Suns_mass|Solar_Mass| , while its smaller companion is 0.6 times as massive as the Sun.  The system is  from  |Earth|Earth| , the shortest distance to a northern-hemisphere star of the first magnitude.   |Gomeisa|Gomeisa| , or Beta Canis Minoris, with a magnitude of 2.89, is the second-brightest star in Canis Minor. Lying  from the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| ,  it is a blue-white  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  star of  |spectral_class|Spectral_Class|  B8  Ve.  Although fainter to Earth observers, it is much brighter than Procyon, and is 250 times as  |luminous|Luminosityastronomy|  and three times as massive as the Sun.  Although its variations are slight, Gomeisa is classified as a  |shell_star|Shell_Star|  , with a maximum magnitude of 2.84 and a minimum magnitude of 2.92. It is surrounded by a disk of gas which it heats and causes to emit radiation.      |Johann_Bayer|Johann_Bayer|  used the Greek letters Alpha to Eta to label the most prominent eight stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Delta .  |John_Flamsteed|John_Flamsteed|  numbered fourteen stars, discerning a third star he named Delta 3 ; his star 12 Canis Minoris was not found subsequently. In Bayers 1603 work  Uranometria , Procyon is located on the dogs belly, and Gomeisa on its neck.  |Gamma|Gamma_Canis_Minoris| ,  |Epsilon|Epsilon_Canis_Minoris|  and  |Eta_Canis_Minoris|Eta_Canis_Minoris|  lie nearby, marking the dogs neck, crown and chest respectively. Although it has an apparent magnitude of 4.34, Gamma Canis Minoris is an orange  |K_type|Stellar_Classification| |_giant|Giant_Star|  of spectral class K3-III C, which lies  away.  Its colour is obvious when seen through binoculars.  It is a multiple system, consisting of the  |spectroscopic_binary|Spectroscopic_Binary|  Gamma A and three optical companions, Gamma B, magnitude 13; Gamma C, magnitude 12; and Gamma D, magnitude 10. The two components of Gamma A orbit each other every 389.2 days, with an eccentric orbit that takes their separation between 2.3 and 1.4  |astronomical_units|Astronomical_Unit|  .  Epsilon Canis Minoris is a yellow  |bright_giant|Bright_Giant|  of spectral class G6.5IIb of magnitude of 4.99.  It lies  from Earth,  with 13 times the diameter and 750 times the luminosity of the Sun.  Eta Canis Minoris is a giant of spectral class F0III of magnitude 5.24,  which has a yellowish hue when viewed through binoculars as well as a faint companion of magnitude 11.1.  Located 4  |arcseconds|Arcsecond|  from the primary, the companion star is actually around 440 AU from the main star and takes around 5000 years to orbit it.      Near Procyon, three stars share the name  |Delta_Canis_Minoris|Delta_Canis_Minoris| .  |Delta_1_|Delta1_Canis_Minoris|  is a yellow-white  |F_type|Stellar_Classification| |_giant|Giant_Star|  of magnitude 5.25 located around  from Earth. About 360 times as luminous and 3.75 times as massive as the Sun, it is expanding and cooling as it ages, having spent much of its life as a  |main_sequence_star|B_Type_Main_Sequence_Star|  of spectrum B6V. Also known as 8 Canis Minoris,  |Delta_2_|Delta2_Canis_Minoris|  is an  |F_type_main_sequence_star|F_Type_Main_Sequence_Star|  of spectral type F2V and magnitude 5.59 which is  distant.  The last of the trio,  |Delta_3_|Delta3_Canis_Minoris|  , is a  |white_main_sequence_star|A_Type_Main_Sequence_Star|  of spectral type A0Vnn and magnitude 5.83 which is  distant.  These stars mark the paws of the Lesser Dogs left hind leg, while magnitude 5.13  |Zeta|Zeta_Canis_Minoris|  marks the right. A blue-white  |bright_giant|Bright_Giant|  of spectral type B8II, Zeta lies around  away from the Solar System.      Lying 222 ± 7 light-years away with an apparent magnitude of 4.39,    |HD_66141|Hd_66141|  is 6.8 billion years old and has  |evolved|Stellar_Evolutionmid_Sized_Stars|  into an orange giant of spectral type K2III with a diameter around 22 times that of the Sun, and weighing 1.1 solar masses. It is 174 times as luminous as the Sun, with an  |absolute_magnitude|Absolute_Magnitude|  of −0.15.  HD 66141 was mistakenly named 13 Puppis, as its celestial coordinates were recorded incorrectly when catalogued and hence mistakenly thought to be in the constellation of  |Puppis|Puppis| ; Bode gave it the name Lambda Canis Minoris, which is now obsolete. The orange giant is orbited by a planet,  |HD_66141b|Hd_66141B| , which was detected in 2012 by measuring the stars  |radial_velocity|Radial_Velocity| . The planet has a mass around 6 times that of  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  and a  |period|Orbital_Period|  of 480 days.     A  |red_giant|Red_Giant|  of spectral type M4III,  |BC_Canis_Minoris|Bc_Canis_Minoris|  lies around  distant from the Solar System.  It is a  |semiregular_variable_star|Semiregular_Variable_Star|  that varies between a maximum magnitude of 6.14 and minimum magnitude of 6.42.  Periods of 27.7, 143.3 and 208.3 days have been recorded in its pulsations.  |AZ|Az_Canis_Minoris| ,  |AD|Ad_Canis_Minoris|  and  |BI_Canis_Minoris|Bi_Canis_Minoris|  are  |Delta_Scuti_variables|Delta_Scuti_Variable| —short period pulsating stars that have been used as  |standard_candles|Cosmic_Distance_Ladderstandard_Candles|  and as subjects to study  |astroseismology|Astroseismology| .  AZ is of spectral type A5IV,  and ranges between magnitudes 6.44 and 6.51 over a period of 2.3 hours.  AD has a spectral type of F2III,  and has a maximum magnitude of 9.21 and minimum of 9.51, with a period of approximately 2.95 hours.  BI is of spectral type F2 with an apparent magnitude varying around 9.19  and a period of approximately 2.91 hours.      At least three red giants are  |Mira_variables|Mira_Variable|  in Canis Minor.  |S_Canis_Minoris|S_Canis_Minoris| , of spectral type M7e,  is the brightest, ranging from magnitude 6.6 to 13.2 over a period of 332.94 days.   |V_Canis_Minoris|V_Canis_Minoris|  ranges from magnitude 7.4 to 15.1 over a period of 366.1 days. Similar in magnitude is  |R_Canis_Minoris|R_Canis_Minoris| , which has a maximum of 7.3, but a significantly brighter minimum of 11.6. An  |S_type_star|S_Type_Star| , it has a period of 337.8 days.       |YZ_Canis_Minoris|Yz_Canis_Minoris|  is a  |red_dwarf|Red_Dwarf|  of spectral type M4.5V and magnitude 11.2,  roughly three times the size of Jupiter and  from Earth. It is a  |flare_star|Flare_Star| , emitting unpredictable outbursts of energy for mere minutes, which might be much more powerful analogues of  |solar_flares|Solar_Flare| .   |Luytens_Star|Luytens_Star|  is a red dwarf star of spectral type M3.5V and close neighbour of the Solar System. Its visual magnitude of 9.9 renders it too faint to be seen with the naked eye,  even though it is only  away.  Fainter still is  |PSS_544_7|Pss_544_7| , an eighteenth-magnitude red dwarf around 20 percent the mass of the Sun, located  from Earth. First noticed in 1991, it is thought to be a cannonball star, shot out of a star cluster and now moving rapidly through space directly away from the  |galactic_disc|Disc| .      The  |WZ_Sagittae|Wz_Sagittae| -type  |dwarf_nova|Dwarf_Nova| |_DY_Canis_Minoris|Dy_Canis_Minoris|   flared up to magnitude 11.4 over January and February 2008 before dropping eight magnitudes to around 19.5 over approximately 80 days. It is a remote binary star system where a  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf|  and low mass star orbit each other close enough for the former star to draw material off the latter and form an  |accretion_disc|Accretion_Disc| . This material builds up until it erupts dramatically.             The  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  passes through much of Canis Minor, yet it has few  |deep_sky_objects|Deep_Sky_Object| .   |William_Herschel|William_Herschel|  recorded four objects in his 1786 work  Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars , including two he mistakenly believed were star clusters.   |NGC_2459|Ngc_2459|  is a group of five thirteenth- and fourteenth-magnitude stars that appear to lie close together in the sky but are not related.  A similar situation has occurred with  |NGC_2394|Ngc_2394| , also in Canis Minor.  This is a collection of fifteen unrelated stars of ninth-magnitude and fainter.     Herschel also observed three faint galaxies, two of which are interacting with each other.  |NGC_2508|Ngc_2508|  is a  |lenticular_galaxy|Lenticular_Galaxy|  of thirteenth-magnitude, estimated at 205 million light-years distance with a diameter of 80 thousand light-years .  Named as a single object by Herschel,  |NGC_2402|Ngc_2402|  is actually a pair of near-adjacent galaxies that appear to be interacting with each other. Only of fourteenth- and fifteenth-magnitudes respectively, the elliptical and spiral galaxy are thought to be approximately 245 million light-years distant, and each measure 55,000 light-years in diameter.        The 11  |Canis_Minorids|Canis_Minorids| , also called the Beta Canis Minorids,  are a  |meteor_shower|Meteor_Shower|  that arise near the fifth-magnitude star  |11_Canis_Minoris|11_Canis_Minoris|  and were discovered in 1964 by Keith Hindley, who investigated their  |trajectory|Trajectory|  and proposed a common origin with the comet  |D_1917_F1|D_1917_F1|  Mellish.  However, this conclusion has been refuted subsequently as the number of orbits analysed was low and their trajectories too disparate to confirm a link.  They last from 4 to 15 December, peaking over 10 and 11 December.
