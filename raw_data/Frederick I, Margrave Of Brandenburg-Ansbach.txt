      Frederick I of Ansbach and Bayreuth  was born at  |Ansbach|Ansbach|  as the eldest son of  |Albert_III_Margrave_of_Brandenburg|Albert_Iii_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg|  by his second wife  |Anna|Anna_Of_Saxony| , daughter of  |Frederick_II_Elector_of_Saxony|Frederick_Ii_Elector_Of_Saxony| . His elder half-brother was the Elector  |Johann_Cicero|Johann_Cicero|  of Brandenburg. Friedrich succeeded his father as  |Margrave_of_Ansbach|Margrave_Of_Ansbach|  in 1486 and his younger brother  |Siegmund|Siegmund_Margrave_Of_Bayreuth|  as  |Margrave_of_Bayreuth|Margrave_Of_Bayreuth|  in 1495.     After depleting the finances of the margraviate with his lavish lifestyle, Frederick I was deposed by his two elder sons,  |Casimir|Kasimir_Margrave_Of_Bayreuth|  and  |George|George_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg_Ansbach| , in 1515. He was then locked up at  |Plassenburg_Castle|Plassenburg|  by his eldest son Casimir in a tower room from which he could not escape for 12 years. Thereupon, his son Casimir took up the rule of the Margraviate of Bayreuth and his son George took up the rule of the Margraviate of Ansbach. However, the overthrow of Frederick did outrage his other younger sons and led to far-reaching political countermeasures. When Elector  |Joachim_I_of_Brandenburg|Joachim_I_Elector_Of_Brandenburg|  visited  |Kulmbach|Kulmbach|  during his journey to  |Augsburg|Augsburg| , and wanted to plead for Fredericks release, he was nevertheless denied entry to Plassenburg Castle. The dispute was finally cleared when an agreement was reached in 1522, in which the demands of the younger sons of Frederick were met.       On 14 February 1479, at  |Frankfurt_|Frankfurt| , Frederick I was married to Princess  |Sophia_of_Poland|Sophia_Of_Poland|  , daughter of King  |Casimir_IV_of_Poland|Casimir_Iv_Of_Poland|  by his wife  |Elisabeth_of_Austria|Elizabeth_Of_Austria| , and sister of King  |Sigismund_I_of_Poland|Sigismund_I_The_Old| .
