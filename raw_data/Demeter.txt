                 In  |ancient_Greek_religion|Ancient_Greek_Religion|  and  |mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Demeter  is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, presiding over  |grains|Grain|  and the  |fertility|Fertility|  of the earth. Her cult titles include Sito , she of the Grain , .  |Cf.|Cf.|  . as the giver of food or grain,  |Eustathius_of_Thessalonica|Eustathius_Of_Thessalonica| , scholia on  |Homer|Homer| , 265. and  |Thesmophoros|Thesmophoria|  , Law-Bringer , as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural society.  |Themis|Themis|  was an ancient Greek goddess, embodiment of divine order, law. She was the organizer of the communal affairs and she evoked the social order: Finley, The World of Odysseus, rev. ed. Viking Press.     Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the  |sacred_law|Religious_Law| , and the cycle of life and death. She and her daughter  |Persephone|Persephone|  were the central figures of the  |Eleusinian_Mysteries|Eleusinian_Mysteries| , a religious tradition that predated the  |Olympian_pantheon|Olympian_Pantheon| , and which may have its roots in the  |Mycenaean_period|Mycenaean_Greece|  c. 1400–1200 BC.  |John_Chadwick|John_Chadwick| , The Mycenean World. Cambridge University Press, 1976. Demeter was often considered to be the same figure as the  |Anatolia|Anatolia| n goddess  |Cybele|Cybele| , and in Rome she was identified as the Latin goddess  |Ceres|Ceres| .       It is possible that Demeter appears in  |Linear_A|Linear_A|  as da-ma-te on three documents , all three apparently dedicated in religious situations and all three bearing just the name . Y.
