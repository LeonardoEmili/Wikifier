           Bletchley Park is a 19th-century mansion and estate in  |Milton_Keynes|Milton_Keynes|   that became the principal centre of  |Allied|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii| |code-breaking_during_the_Second_World_War|World_War_Ii_Cryptography| . The mansion was constructed during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir  |Herbert_Leon|Herbert_Leon|  in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , the estate housed the British  |Government_Code_and_Cypher_School|Government_Code_And_Cypher_School|  , which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the  |Axis_Powers|Axis_Powers| most importantly the German  |Enigma|Enigma|  and  |Lorenz|Lorenz_Cipher|  ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC & CS team of codebreakers included  |Alan_Turing|Alan_Turing| ,  |Gordon_Welchman|Gordon_Welchman| ,  |Hugh_Alexander|Conel_Hugh_Odonel_Alexander|  and  |Stuart_Milner-Barry|Stuart_Milner-Barry| . The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.     According to the official historian of British Intelligence, the  |Ultra|Ultra|  intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.  The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the development of  |Colossus|Colossus_Computer| , the worlds first programmable digital electronic computer. Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the  |Post_Office|General_Post_Office|  took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment, and the Bletchley Park Trust formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations, as well as  |The_National_Museum_of_Computing|The_National_Museum_Of_Computing| , established on the site which includes a rebuilt Colossus machine, and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.        The site appears in the  |Domesday_Book|Domesday_Book|  as part of the  |Manor_of_Eaton|Water_Eaton,_Milton_Keynes| .  |Browne_Willis|Browne_Willis|  built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down. It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by  |Samuel_Lipscomb_Seckham|Samuel_Lipscomb_Seckham|  in 1877.  The estate of  was bought in 1883 by Sir  |Herbert_Samuel_Leon|Herbert_Samuel_Leon| , who expanded the then-existing farmhouse  into what architect  |Landis_Gores|Landis_Gores|  called a maudlin and monstrous pile   combining  |Victorian_Gothic|Victorian_Gothic| ,  |Tudor|Tudor_Revival_Architecture| , and  |Dutch_Baroque|Dutch_Baroque_Architecture|  styles.  At his Christmas family gatherings there was a horse meet on Boxing Day with glasses of sloe gin from the butler, and the house was always humming with servants . With 40 gardeners, a flower bed of yellow daffodils could become a sea of red tulips overnight.     In 1938, the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder for a housing estate, but in May 1938 Admiral Sir  |Hugh_Sinclair|Hugh_Sinclair| , head of the  |Secret_Intelligence_Service|Secret_Intelligence_Service|  , bought the mansion and  of land for £6,000 , using his own money after the Government said they did not have the budget to do so, for use by GC & CS and SIS in the event of war.      A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues  was Bletchleys geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to  |Bletchley_railway_station|Bletchley_Railway_Station| , where the  |Varsity_Line|Varsity_Line|  between  |Oxford|Oxford|  and  |Cambridge|Cambridge| whose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakersmet the main  |West_Coast_railway_line|West_Coast_Main_Line|  connecting London,  |Birmingham|Birmingham| ,  |Manchester|Manchester| ,  |Liverpool|Liverpool| ,  |Glasgow|Glasgow|  and  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| .  |Watling_Street|Watling_Street| , the main road linking London to the north-west  was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby  |Fenny_Stratford|Fenny_Stratford| .      Bletchley Park was known as B.P. to those who worked there.    Station X , London Signals Intelligence Centre , and  |Government_Communications_Headquarters|Government_Communications_Headquarters|  were all cover names used during the war.    The formal posting of the many Wrens members of the  |Womens_Royal_Naval_Service|Womens_Royal_Naval_Service| working there, was to  |HMS_Pembroke_V|Raf_Eastcote| . Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included  |RAF_Eastcote|Raf_Eastcote| , RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green.  The postal address that staff had to use was Room 47, Foreign Office .  in      After the war, the Government Code & Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters , moving to  |Eastcote|Eastcote|  in 1946 and to  |Cheltenham|Cheltenham|  in the 1950s.  The site was used by various government agencies, including the  |GPO|General_Post_Office|  and the  |Civil_Aviation_Authority|Civil_Aviation_Authority| . One large building, block F, was demolished in 1987 by which time the site was being run down with tenants leaving. In 1990 the site was at risk of being sold for housing development. However,  |Milton_Keynes_Council|Milton_Keynes_Council|  made it into a conservation area. Bletchley Park Trust was set up in 1991 by a group of people who recognised the sites importance. The initial trustees included Roger Bristow, Ted Enever,  |Peter_Wescombe|Peter_Wescombe| , Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological & Historical Society, and  |Tony_Sale|Tony_Sale|  who in 1994 became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums.              Commander  |Alastair_Denniston|Alastair_Denniston|  was operational head of GC & CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the  |Admiraltys|Admiralty| |Room_40|Room_40|  and the  |War_Offices|War_Office| |MI1|Mi1| b.  Key GC & CS  |cryptanalysts|Cryptanalysis|  who moved from London to Bletchley Park included  |John_Tiltman|John_Tiltman| ,  |Dillwyn_Dilly_Knox|Dilly_Knox| ,  |Josh_Cooper|Josh_Cooper| , and  |Nigel_de_Grey|Nigel_De_Grey| . These people had a variety of backgroundslinguists and chess champions were common, and in Knoxs case  |papyrology|Papyrology| . The British War Office recruited top solvers of  |cryptic_crossword|Cryptic_Crossword|  puzzles, as these individuals had strong  |lateral_thinking|Lateral_Thinking|  skills.      On  |the_day_Britain_declared_war_on_Germany|British_And_French_Declaration_Of_War_On_Germany| , Denniston wrote to the  |Foreign_Office|Foreign_Office|  about recruiting men of the professor type .  Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs.  In one 1941 recruiting stratagem,  The Daily Telegraph  was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort .      Denniston recognised, however, that the enemys use of electromechanical cipher machines meant that formally trained mathematicians would also be needed;  Oxfords  |Peter_Twinn|Peter_Twinn|  joined GC & CS in February 1939;  Cambridges  |Alan_Turing|Alan_Turing|   and  |Gordon_Welchman|Gordon_Welchman|   began training in 1938 and reported to Bletchley the day after war was declared, along with  |John_Jeffreys|John_R.F._Jeffreys| . Later-recruited cryptanalysts included the mathematicians  |Derek_Taunt|Derek_Taunt| ,  in   |Jack_Good|I.J._Good| ,  |Bill_Tutte|W._T._Tutte| ,  Appendix 4 in  and  |Max_Newman|Max_Newman| ; historian  |Harry_Hinsley|Harry_Hinsley| , and chess champions  |Hugh_Alexander|Conel_Hugh_Odonel_Alexander|  and  |Stuart_Milner-Barry|Stuart_Milner-Barry| .   |Joan_Clarke|Joan_Clarke|   was one of the few women employed at Bletchley as a full-fledged cryptanalyst.       This eclectic staff of  |Boffins|Boffin|  and  |Debs|Deb|   caused GC & CS to be whimsically dubbed the Golf, Cheese and Chess Society .  During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit,  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  reportedly remarked to Denniston: I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally.  Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill. His response was Action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.  The Army CIGS  |Alan_Brooke|Alan_Brooke|  wrote that on 16 April 1942 Took lunch in car and went to see the organization for breaking down ciphers – a wonderful set of professors and genii! I marvel at the work they succeed in doing.       After initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by  |John_Tiltman|John_Tiltman|    staff worked a six-day week, rotating through three shifts: 4p.m. to midnight, midnight to 8a.m. , and 8a.m. to 4p.m., each with a half-hour meal break. At the end of the third week, a worker went off at 8a.m. and came back at 4p.m., thus putting in sixteen hours on that last day. The irregular hours affected workers health and social life, as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged. The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration; staff got one weeks leave four times a year, but some girls collapsed and required extended rest.  Recruitment took place to combat a shortage of experts in Morse code and German.      In January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, some 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations.  About three-quarters of these were women. Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds and held degrees in the areas of mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given entry into  |STEM|Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_And_Mathematics|  programs due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war. They performed complex calculations and coding and hence were integral to the computing processes.  For example,  |Eleanor_Ireland|Eleanor_Ireland|  worked on the  |Colossus_computers|Colossus_Computer| .      The female staff in Dilwyn Knoxs section were sometimes termed Dillys Fillies .  Dillys girls included Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, and Elisabeth Granger.  |Jane_Hughes|Jane_Hughes|  processed information leading to the  |last_battle_of_the_Bismarck|Last_Battle_Of_The_Battleship_Bismarck| .  |Mavis_Lever|Mavis_Lever|   made the first break into the Italian naval traffic. She and  |Margaret_Rock|Margaret_Rock|  solved a German code,  the  |Abwehr_break|Abwehr| .      Many of the women had backgrounds in languages, particularly French and German.  |Rozanne_Colchester|Rozanne_Colchester|  was a translator who worked at Bletchley from April 1942 until January 1945, mainly for the Italian air forces Section.  Like most of the Bletchleyettes, she came from the higher middle class, her father, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst, being an air attaché in Rome. Before joining Bletchley, Colchester was moving in high circles: “she had met Hitler and been flirted with by Mussolini at an embassy party”, writes Sarah Rainey. She joined the Park because she found it thrilling to fight for her country.       |Cicely_Mayhew|Cicely_Mayhew|  was recruited straight from university, having graduated from  |Lady_Margaret_Hall,_Oxford|Lady_Margaret_Hall,_Oxford|  in 1944 with a First in French and German, after only two years. She worked in Hut 8, translating decoded German Navy signals.       |Ruth_Briggs|Audrey_Ruth_Briggs| , a German scholar, worked within the Naval Section and was known as one of the best cryptographers;  she married  |Oliver_Churchill|Oliver_Churchill|  of the SOE.      For a long time, the British Government didnt recognize the contributions the personnel at Bletchley Park made. Their work achieved official recognition only in 2009.        Properly used, the German Enigma and  |Lorenz_ciphers|Lorenz_Cipher|  should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchleys attacks just barely feasible. These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures,  and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany had any hint of Bletchleys success. Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britains  |Ultra|Ultra|  secret higher even than the normally highest classification and security was paramount.      All staff signed the  |Official_Secrets_Act|Official_Secrets_Act_1939|  and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut...      Nevertheless, there were security leaks.  |Jock_Colville|Jock_Colville| , the Assistant Private Secretary to  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill| , recorded in his diary on 31 July 1941, that the newspaper proprietor  |Lord_Camrose|Lord_Camrose|  had discovered Ultra and that security leaks increase in number and seriousness . Without doubt, the most serious of these was that Bletchley Park had been infiltrated by  |John_Cairncross|John_Cairncross| , the notorious Soviet mole and member of the  |Cambridge_Spy_Ring|Cambridge_Spy_Ring| , who leaked Ultra material to Moscow.            The first personnel of the  |Government_Code_and_Cypher_School|Government_Code_And_Cypher_School|  moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to  |MI6|Mi6| . Construction of the wooden huts began in late 1939, and Elmers School, a neighbouring boys boarding school in a Victorian Gothic redbrick building by a church, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.      After the  |United_States|United_States|  joined World War II, a number of American  |cryptographers|Cryptographer|  were posted to  |Hut_3|Hut_3| , and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence.   In contrast, the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities a reflection of Churchills distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.      The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 2021 November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for  |Bletchley_railway_station|Bletchley_Railway_Station| ; Hut4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as   work inside continued.           Non-naval Enigma messages were deciphered in  |Hut_6|Hut_&_Nbsp;6| , followed by translation, indexing and cross-referencing, in  |Hut_3|Hut_&_Nbsp;3| . Only then was it sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service , the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.      Naval Enigma deciphering was in  |Hut_8|Hut_&_Nbsp;8| , with translation in  |Hut_4|Hut_&_Nbsp;4| .   Verbatim translations were sent only to the  |Naval_Intelligence_Division|Naval_Intelligence_Division|  of the Admiraltys Operational Intelligence Centre , supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology.      Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut8 provided excellent cribs for  |Known-plaintext_attacks|Known-Plaintext_Attack|  on the daily naval Enigma key.        Initially, a  |wireless|Radio|  room was established at Bletchley Park.   It was set up in the mansions water tower under the code name Station  X ,  a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The X is the  |Roman_numeral|Roman_Numeral|  ten , this being the Secret Intelligence Services tenth such station. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby  |Whaddon_Hall|Whaddon_Hall|  to avoid drawing attention to the site.       Subsequently, other listening stationsthe  |Y-stations|Y-Stations| , such as the ones at  |Chicksands|Raf_Chicksands|  in Bedfordshire,  |Beaumanor_Hall|Beaumanor_Hall| , Leicestershire and  |Beeston_Hill_Y_Station|Beeston_Hill_Y_Station|  in Norfolkgathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle  |despatch_riders|Despatch_Rider|  or by teleprinter.        The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.  in                 Often a huts number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original Hut designation. Some of this information has been derived from  .    Hut 1 used to house the Wireless Station for a short time, later administrative functions such as transport, typing, and Bombe maintenance. The first Bombe, Victory , was initially housed here.

Block GBlock HTunny and Colossus .                Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the  |Enigma|Enigma_Machine|  cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor  |Lorenz_SZ42_on-line_teleprinter_cipher_machine|Lorenz_Cipher| .      Five weeks before the outbreak of war, Warsaws  |Cipher_Bureau|Biuro_Szyfrów|  revealed  |its_achievements|Cryptanalysis_Of_The_Enigma|  in breaking Enigma to astonished French and British personnel. The British used the Poles information and techniques, and the  |Enigma_clone|Polish_Enigma_Doubles|  sent to them in August 1939, which greatly increased their success in decrypting Enigma messages.           The  |bombe|Bombe|  was an electromechanical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military  |networks|Telecommunications_Network| .    Its pioneering design was developed by  |Alan_Turing|Alan_Turing|  and the machine was engineered by  |Harold_Doc_Keen|Harold_Keen|  of the  |British_Tabulating_Machine_Company|British_Tabulating_Machine_Company| . Each machine was about  high and wide,  deep and weighed about a ton.      At its peak, GC & CS was reading approximately 4,000 messages per day.  As a hedge against enemy attack  most bombes were dispersed to installations at  |Adstock|Adstock|  and  |Wavendon|Wavendon|  , and  |Gayhurst|Gayhurst| .        |Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe|  messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months.  Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the  |US_Navy_bombe|Us_Navy_Bombe|  that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.          The  |Lorenz_messages|Cryptanalysis_Of_The_Lorenz_Cipher|  were codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the  |Testery|Testery|   worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in  |Colossus|Colossus_Computer| , the worlds first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by  |Tommy_Flowers|Tommy_Flowers|  and his team at the  |Post_Office_Research_Station|Post_Office_Research_Station|  at  |Dollis_Hill|Dollis_Hill| . The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for  |D-day|Normandy_Landings| . Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the  |Newmanry|Newmanry|  after its head  |Max_Newman|Max_Newman| .      Bletchleys work was essential to defeating the  |U-boats|U-Boat|  in the  |Battle_of_the_Atlantic|Battle_Of_The_Atlantic| , and to the British naval victories in the  |Battle_of_Cape_Matapan|Battle_Of_Cape_Matapan|  and the  |Battle_of_North_Cape|Battle_Of_North_Cape| . In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the  |North_African_desert_campaign|North_African_Campaign|  against German forces under General  |Erwin_Rommel|Erwin_Rommel| . General Sir  |Claude_Auchinleck|Claude_Auchinleck|  wrote that were it not for Ultra, Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo . While not changing the events,  |Ultra|Ultra|  decrypts featured prominently in the story of  |Operation_SALAM|Operation_Salaam| ,  |László_Almásys|László_Almásy|  mission across  |the_desert|Western_Desert|  behind Allied lines in 1942. Gross, Kuno, Michael Rolke and András Zboray,   - László Almásy’s most daring Mission in the Desert War, Belleville, München, 2013 Prior to the  |Normandy_landings|Normandy_Landings|  on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germanys fifty-eight Western-front divisions.              Italian signals had been of interest since Italys attack on Abyssinia in 1935.   During the  |Spanish_Civil_War|Spanish_Civil_War|  the  |Italian_Navy|Royal_Italian_Navy|  used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.   When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were wholesale changes in Italian codes and cyphers.      Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women , who included  |Margaret_Rock|Margaret_Rock| , Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and  |Mavis_Lever|Mavis_Batey| .    Mavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navys operational plans before the  |Battle_of_Cape_Matapan|Battle_Of_Cape_Matapan|  in 1941, leading to a British victory.  in      Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral  |Cunningham|Andrew_Cunningham,_1St_Viscount_Cunningham_Of_Hyndhope|  visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.     On entering World War II in June 1940, the  |Italians|Italy|  were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the  |Italian_Navy|Italian_Navy| , which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the  |C-38|C-38|  version of the  |Boris_Hagelin|Boris_Hagelin| |rotor-based|Rotor_Machine| |cipher_machine|Cipher_Machine| , particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.  Transcript of a lecture given on Tuesday 19 October 1993 at Cambridge University   As a consequence,  |JRM_Butler|James_Ramsay_Montagu_Butler|  recruited his former student  |Bernard_Willson|Bernard_Willson|  to join a team with two others in Hut4.  in   in  In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  and  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommels  |Afrika_Korps|Afrika_Korps| . This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the  |Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe|  in North Africa reduced by 90 percent.    After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.      A Middle East Intelligence Centre was set up in Cairo in 1939. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo. A Combined Bureau Middle East was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made increasingly bitter complaints that  |GC_&_CS|Gc_&_Cs|  was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers. However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained.  |Hinsley,_Harry|Harry_Hinsley|  British Intelligence in the Second World War, Volume One: Its Influence on Strategy and Operations pp. 191221, 57072   |John_Chadwick|John_Chadwick|  started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base HMS Nile in Alexandria. Later, he was with GC & CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.  , Faculty of Classics, Cambridge University       Soviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 193940,  |John_Tiltman|John_Tiltman|  set up two Russian sections at Wavendon and at  |Sarafand|Sarafand_Al-Amar|  in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC & CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.  in        An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the  |Far_East_Combined_Bureau|Far_East_Combined_Bureau|  . The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then  |Colombo|Colombo| ,  |Ceylon|Sri_Lanka| , then  |Kilindini|Kilindini_Harbour| ,  |Mombasa|Mombasa| , Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune.  The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the  |Wireless_Experimental_Centre|Wireless_Experimental_Centre|  at  |Delhi|Delhi| , India.      In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until wars end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in  |Hut_7|Hut_&_Nbsp;7| , under  |John_Tiltman|John_Tiltman| .     By mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at  |Arlington_Hall|Arlington_Hall| , Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: Only now are the British codebreakers  beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers .            After the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work.  Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled .  That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censors net and appeared in print.      With the publication of  |F.W._Winterbothams|F._W._Winterbotham|  The Ultra Secret  public discussion of Bletchleys work finally became possible    .
