      Joseph Harold Greenberg was an American  |linguist|Linguistics| , known mainly for his work concerning  |linguistic_typology|Linguistic_Typology|  and the  |genetic_classification|Genetic_Relationship|  of languages.                Joseph Greenberg was born on May 28, 1915 to  |Jewish|Jewish|  parents in  |Brooklyn,_New_York|Brooklyn,_New_York| . His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in  |Steinway_Hall|Steinway_Hall| . He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.     After finishing high school, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at  |Columbia_University|Columbia_University|  in New York. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by  |Franz_Boas|Franz_Boas|  concerning  |American_Indian_languages|Indigenous_Languages_Of_The_Americas| . With references from Boas and  |Ruth_Benedict|Ruth_Benedict| , he was accepted as a graduate student by  |Melville_J._Herskovits|Melville_J._Herskovits|  at  |Northwestern_University|Northwestern_University|  in Chicago. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the  |Hausa|Hausa_People|  people of Nigeria, where he learned the  |Hausa_language|Hausa_Language| . The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of  |Islam|Islam|  on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.     During 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at  |Yale_University|Yale_University| . These were interrupted by service in the  |U.S._Army_Signal_Corps|Signal_Corps|  during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , for which he worked as a  |codebreaker|Cryptanalysis|  and participated with the  |landing_at_Casablanca|Operation_Torchbattle| . Before leaving for Europe during 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia University.       After the war, Greenberg taught at the  |University_of_Minnesota|University_Of_Minnesota|  before returning to Columbia University during 1948 as a teacher of  |anthropology|Cultural_Anthropology| . While in New York, he became acquainted with  |Roman_Jakobson|Roman_Jakobson|  and  |André_Martinet|André_Martinet| . They introduced him to the  |Prague_school|Prague_Linguistic_Circle|  of  |structuralism|Structuralism| , which influenced his work.     During 1962, Greenberg relocated to the anthropology department of  |Stanford_University|Stanford_University|  in California, where he continued to work for the rest of his life. During 1965 Greenberg served as president of the  |African_Studies_Association|African_Studies_Association| . He received during 1996 the highest award for a scholar in Linguistics, the Gold Medal of Philology.             Greenbergs reputation rests partly on his contributions to  |synchronic_linguistics|Synchronic_Linguistics|  and the quest to identify  |linguistic_universals|Greenbergs_Linguistic_Universals| . During the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.     In particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of  |implicational_universal|Linguistic_Universal| , which has the form, if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y. For example, X might be mid front rounded vowels and Y high front rounded vowels . Many scholars adopted this kind of research following Greenbergs example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.     Like  |Noam_Chomsky|Noam_Chomsky| , Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures on which human language is based. Unlike Chomsky, Greenbergs method was  |functionalist|Functionalist_Theories_Of_Grammar| , rather than  |formalist|Formal_Language_Theory| . An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan methods can be found in Linguistic Universals , edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil .     Many who are strongly opposed to Greenbergs methods of language classification acknowledge the importance of his typological work. During 1963 he published an article that was extremely influential: Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements .            Greenberg rejected the opinion, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that  |comparative_reconstruction|Comparative_Method|  was the only method to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: one cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until one knows which languages to compare .     He also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,749,027,089,305,918,018 ways . For comparison, the  |Niger–Congo|Niger–Congo_Languages|  family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.     Greenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned .     Greenberg used the premise that mass borrowing of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters in certain semantic areas , making it easy to detect . With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.     Greenberg first termed his method mass comparison in an article of 1954 . As of 1987, he replaced the term mass comparison with multilateral comparison , to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step . According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification .     Most historical linguists reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been  |Lyle_Campbell|Lyle_Campbell| ,  |Donald_Ringe|Donald_Ringe| ,  |William_Poser|William_Poser| , and the late  |R._Larry_Trask|Larry_Trask| .             Greenberg is known widely for his development of a classification system for the  |languages_of_Africa|Languages_Of_Africa| , which he published as a series of articles in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology from 1949 to 1954 . He revised the book and published it again during 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition of 1966 . A few more changes of the classification were made by Greenberg in an article during 1981.     Greenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed  |Afroasiatic|Afro-Asiatic_Languages| ,  |Nilo-Saharan|Nilo-Saharan_Languages| ,  |Niger–Congo|Niger–Congo_Languages| , and  |Khoisan|Khoisan_Languages| . During the course of his work, Greenberg invented the term Afroasiatic to replace the earlier term Hamito-Semitic , after showing that the  |Hamitic|Hamitic|  group, accepted widely since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to establish the classification of the  |Bantu_languages|Bantu_Languages| , which occupy much of  |sub-Saharan_Africa|Sub-Saharan_Africa| , as a part of the Niger–Congo family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.     Greenbergs classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan language family. Now, apart from Khoisan, it is generally accepted by African specialists and has been used as a basis for further work by other scholars.     Greenbergs work on African languages has been criticised by  |Lyle_Campbell|Lyle_Campbell|  and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data and request a re-examination of his macro-phyla by reliable methods .  |Harold_Fleming|Harold_C._Fleming|  and  |Lionel_Bender|Lionel_Bender| , who were sympathetic to Greenbergs classification, acknowledged that at least some of his macrofamilies are not accepted completely by most linguists and may need to be divided . Their objection was  |methodological|Methodology| |Kongo-Saharan|Niger–Congo_Languagesniger–Congo_And_Nilo-Saharan| .  |Roger_Blench|Roger_Blench|  suggests Niger–Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.            During 1971 Greenberg proposed the  |Indo-Pacific|Indo-Pacific_Languages| |macrofamily|Macrofamily| , which groups together the  |Papuan_languages|Papuan_Languages|   with the native languages of the  |Andaman_Islands|Andaman_Islands|  and  |Tasmania|Tasmania|  but excludes the  |Australian_Aboriginal_languages|Indigenous_Australian_Languages| . Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the  |Austronesian_languages|Austronesian_Languages| , which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of people.     Greenbergs  |subgrouping|Subgrouping|  of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of  |Stephen_Wurm|Stephen_Wurm|  and  |Malcolm_Ross|Malcolm_Ross|  has provided considerable evidence for his once-radical idea that these languages form a single genetic unit. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and Timor–Alor families are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity in a number of instances. He believes this to be due to a linguistic  |substratum|Substratum| .          Most linguists concerned with the  |native_languages_of_the_Americas|Indigenous_Languages_Of_The_Americas|  classify them into 150 to 180 independent language families. Some believe that two language families,  |Eskimo–Aleut|Eskimo–Aleut|  and  |Na-Dené|Na-Dené| , were distinct, perhaps the results of later migrations into the New World.     Early on, Greenberg became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book Language in the Americas, while agreeing that the  |Eskimo–Aleut|Eskimo–Aleut|  and  |Na-Dené|Na-Dené|  groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed  |Amerind|Amerind_Languages| .     Language in the Americas has generated lively debate, but has been criticized strongly; it is rejected by most specialists of indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists of the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenbergs data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.

They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.     However, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenbergs Amerind classification: the “First American” category. “The cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.” Nevertheless, this category of “First American” people also interbred with and contributed a significant amount of genes to the ancestors of both Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dené populations, with 60% and 90% First American DNA respectively constituting the genetic makeup of the two groups. Reich, David. . Who We Are and How We Got Here Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past. Chapter 7.            Later in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern  |Eurasia|Eurasia|  belong to a single higher-order family, which he termed  |Eurasiatic|Eurasiatic_Languages| . The only exception was  |Yeniseian|Yeniseian_Languages| , which has been related to a wider  |Dené–Caucasian|Dené–Caucasian|  grouping, also including  |Sino-Tibetan|Sino-Tibetan_Languages| . During 2008  |Edward_Vajda|Edward_Vajda|  related Yeniseian to the  |Na-Dené|Na-Dene_Languages|  languages of North America as a  |Dené–Yeniseian|Dené–Yeniseian|  family. , University of Alaska Fairbanks     The Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older  |Nostratic|Nostratic_Languages|  groupings of  |Holger_Pedersen|Holger_Pedersen|  and  |Vladislav_Illich-Svitych|Vladislav_Illich-Svitych|  by including  |Indo-European|Indo-European_Languages| ,  |Uralic|Uralic_Languages| , and  |Altaic|Altaic_Languages| . It differs by including  |Nivkh|Nivkh_Language| ,  |Japonic|Classification_Of_Japanese| ,  |Korean|Korean_Language| , and  |Ainu|Ainu_Language|  and in excluding  |Afroasiatic|Afroasiatic_Languages| . At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably  |Sergei_Starostin|Sergei_Starostin| , constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly larger than Greenbergs grouping but it also excluded Afroasiatic.     Recently, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern tier and a southern tier .     The American Nostraticist  |Allan_Bomhard|Allan_R._Bomhard|  considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic, alongside other branches: Afroasiatic,  |Elamo-Dravidian|Elamo-Dravidian_Languages| , and  |Kartvelian|Kartvelian_Languages| . Similarly,  |Georgiy_Starostin|Georgiy_Starostin|  arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to any other language family. , Russia Sergei Starostins school has now included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic. They reserve the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping, which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise inclusion of Dravidian and Kartvelian.     Greenberg continued to work on this project after he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer and until he died during May 2001. His colleague and former student  |Merritt_Ruhlen|Merritt_Ruhlen|  ensured the publication of the final volume of his Eurasiatic work after his death.
