Rehoboam  was the fifth and last king of the  |Kingdom_of_Israel|Kingdom_Of_Israel|  but the first king of the  |Kingdom_of_Judah|Kingdom_Of_Judah| . He was a son of and the successor to  |Solomon|Solomon|  and a grandson of  |David|King_David| . In the account of  |I_Kings|Books_Of_Kings|  and  |II_Chronicles|Books_Of_Chronicles| , he was initially king of the  |United_Monarchy_of_Israel|United_Monarchy_Of_Israel| , but after the ten northern tribes of Israel rebelled in 932/931 BC to form the independent  |Northern_Kingdom_of_Israel|Kingdom_Of_Israel| , under the rule of  |Jeroboam|Jeroboam| , Rehoboam remained as king only of the  |Kingdom_of_Judah|Kingdom_Of_Judah| , or southern kingdom.          According to the  |Jewish_Encyclopaedia|Jewish_Encyclopaedia| , Solomons wisdom and power were not sufficient to prevent the rebellion of several of his border cities.  |Damascus|Aram_Damascus|  under  |Rezon|Rezon_The_Syrian|  secured its independence Solomon; and Jeroboam, a superintendent of works, his ambition stirred by the words of the prophet  |Ahijah|Ahijah_The_Shilonite|  , fled to  |Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| . Thus before the death of Solomon the apparently unified kingdom of David began to disintegrate. With Damascus independent and a powerful man of  |Ephraim|Tribe_Of_Ephraim| , the most prominent of the Ten Tribes, awaiting his opportunity, the future of Solomons kingdom became dubious .  . Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906.      According to , Solomon had broken the mandate of the  |Torah|Torah|   by marrying foreign wives and being influenced by them, worshipping and building shrines to the  |Moab|Moab| ite and  |Ammon|Ammon| ite gods.        Rehoboams mother,  |Naamah|Naamah| , was an Ammonitess, and thus one of the foreign wives whom Solomon married.  In the  |Revised_Version|Revised_Version|  she is referred to as the Ammonitess .        Conventional  |biblical_chronology|Chronology_Of_The_Bible|  dates the start of Rehoboams reign to the mid-10th century BC. His reign is described in  and  and in  in the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| . Rehoboam was 41 years old  when he ascended the throne.        The assembly for the coronation of Solomons successor, Rehoboam, was called at  |Shechem|Shechem| , the one sacredly historic city within the territory of the Ten Tribes. Before the coronation took place the assembly requested certain reforms in the policy followed by Rehoboams father, Solomon. The reforms requested would materially reduce the royal exchequer and hence its power to continue the magnificence of Solomons court. The older men counseled Rehoboam at least to speak to the people in a civil manner . However, the new king sought the advice from the young men he had grown up with, who advised the king to show no weakness to the people, and to tax them even more, which Rehoboam did. He proclaimed to the people,        Although the ostensible reason was the heavy burden laid upon Israel because of Solomons great outlay for buildings and for luxury of all kinds, the other reasons include the historical opposition between the north and the south. The two sections had acted independently until David, by his victories, succeeded in uniting all the tribes, though the Ephraimitic jealousy was ever ready to develop into open revolt. Religious considerations were also operative. The building of the  |Temple|Solomons_Temple|  was a severe blow for the various sanctuaries scattered through the land, and the priests of the high places probably supported the revolt.  |Josephus|Josephus|  has the rebels exclaim: We leave to Rehoboam the Temple his father built.      Jeroboam and the people rebelled, with the  |ten_northern_tribes|Ten_Lost_Tribes|  breaking away and forming a separate kingdom. The new breakaway kingdom continued to be called  |Kingdom_of_Israel|Kingdom_Of_Israel| , and was also known as  |Samaria|Samaria| , or  |Ephraim|Ephraim|  or the northern Kingdom. The realm Rehoboam was left with was called  |Kingdom_of_Judah|Kingdom_Of_Judah| .     During Rehoboams 17-year reign,  he retained  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  as Judahs capital but          Rehoboam went to war against the new Kingdom of Israel with a force of 180,000 soldiers. However, he was advised against fighting his brethren, and so returned to Jerusalem. ,  The narrative reports that Israel and Judah were in a state of war throughout his 17-year reign.             In the fifth year of Rehoboams reign,  |Shishak|Shishak| , king of Egypt, brought a huge army and took many cities. According to Joshua, son of Nadav, the mention in 2 Chronicles 11, 6 sqq., that Rehoboam built fifteen fortified cities, indicates that the attack was not unexpected. The account in Chronicles states that Shishaq marched with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and troops who came with him from Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Kushites.  Shishaqs armies captured all of the fortified towns leading to Jerusalem between Gezer and Gibeon. When they laid siege to Jerusalem, Rehoboam gave Shishaq all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute. The Egyptian campaign cut off trade with south Arabia via Elath and the Negev that had been established during Solomons reign.  Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.       Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60  |concubines|Concubine| . They bore him 28 sons and 60 daughters. His wives included Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and Abihail, the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. His sons with Mahalath were Jeush, Shemariah, and  |Zaham|Zaham| . After Mahalath he married his cousin  |Maacah|Maacah| , daughter of  |Absalom|Absalom| ,  |Davids|David|  son. His sons with Maacah were  |Abijah|Abijah_Of_Judah| , Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.  The names of his other wives, sons and all his daughters are not given.     Rehoboam reigned for 17 years.  1 Kings 14:21 When he died he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem. He was succeeded by his son  |Abijah|Abijam| .        The fact that Rehoboam, the son of King Solomon, was born of an Ammonite woman also made it difficult to maintain the Messianic claims of the house of David; but it was adduced as an illustration of divine Providence which selected the two doves, Ruth, the Moabite, and Naamah, the Ammonitess, for honorable distinction .  Naamah An Ammonitess; one of Solomons wives and mother of Rehoboam . In the second Greek account Naamah is said to have been the daughter of Hanun , son of Nahash, a king of Ammon . Naamah is praised, in B. á¸². 38b, for her righteousness, on account of which Moses had previously been warned by God not to make war upon the Ammonites , as Naamah was to descend from them.      Rehoboam was the son of an Ammonite woman; and when David praised God because it was permissible to marry Ammonites and Moabites, he held the child upon his knees, giving thanks for himself as well as for Rehoboam, since this permission was of advantage to them both . Rehoboam was stricken with a running sore as a punishment for the curse which David had invoked upon Joab when he prayed that Joabs house might forever be afflicted with leprosy and running sores . All the treasures which Israel had brought from Egypt were kept until the Egyptian king Shishak took them from Rehoboam .        Using the information in Kings and Chronicles,  |Edwin_Thiele|Edwin_R._Thiele|  has calculated the date for the division of the kingdom is 931  930 BC. Thiele noticed that for the first seven kings of Israel , the synchronisms to Judean kings fell progressively behind by one year for each king. Thiele saw this as evidence that the northern kingdom was measuring the years by a non-accession system , whereas the southern kingdom was using the accession method . Once this was understood, the various reign lengths and cross-synchronisms for these kings was worked out, and the sum of reigns for both kingdoms produced 931/930 BC for the division of the kingdom when working backwards from the  |Battle_of_Qarqar|Battle_Of_Qarqar|  in 853 BC. According to newer chronologists such as  |Gershon_Galil|Gershon_Galil|  and  |Kenneth_Kitchen|Kenneth_Kitchen| , however, the values are 931 BC for the beginning of the coregency and 915/914 BC for Rehoboams death.     One episode which the Bible places during the reign of Rehoboam, and which is confirmed by the records from the  |Bubastite_Portal|Bubastite_Portal|  in  |Karnak|Karnak|  and other archaeological find , is the Egyptian invasion of  |Judea|Judea|  by the  |Egyptian|Twenty-Second_Dynasty_Of_Egypt| |pharaoh|Pharaoh| |Shoshenq_I|Shoshenq_I| , who is identified by many with the biblical King  |Shishak|Shishak| . One of the most difficult issues in identifying Shishak with Shoshenq I is the biblical statement that King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. He seized the treasures of the Lords temple and the royal palace , making this Shoshenqs biggest prize, whereas the Bubastite Portal lists do not include Jerusalem or any city from central Judea among the surviving names in the list of Shoshenqs conquests.
