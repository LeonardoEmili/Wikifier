According to the orthodox  |Thomism|Thomism|  of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| ,  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. Against this, the Averroists, led by  |Agostino_Nifo|Agostino_Nifo| , introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.

The Alexandrists, led by  |Pietro_Pomponazzi|Pietro_Pomponazzi| , assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle. They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.
