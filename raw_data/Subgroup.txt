           In  |group_theory|Group_Theory| , a branch of  |mathematics|Mathematics| , given a  |group|Group|  G under a  |binary_operation|Binary_Operation|   ∗, a  |subset|Subset|  H of G is called a subgroup of G if H also forms a group under the operation  ∗. More precisely, H is a subgroup of G if the  |restriction|Function_Restrictions_And_Extensions|  of ∗ to  is a group operation on H. This is usually denoted , read as H is a subgroup of G .     The trivial subgroup of any group is the subgroup  consisting of just the identity element.     A proper subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H which is a  |proper_subset|Subset|  of G . This is usually represented notationally by  .
