         Germanium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Ge and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  32. It is a lustrous, hard-brittle, grayish-white  |metalloid|Metalloid|  in the  |carbon_group|Carbon_Group| , chemically similar to its group neighbours  |silicon|Silicon|  and  |tin|Tin| . Pure germanium is a  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally  |reacts|Chemical_Reaction|  and forms complexes with  |oxygen|Oxygen|  in nature.     Because it seldom appears in high concentration, germanium was discovered comparatively late in the  |history_of_chemistry|History_Of_Chemistry| . Germanium ranks near fiftieth  |in_relative_abundance_of_the_elements_in_the_Earths_crust|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust| . In 1869,  |Dmitri_Mendeleev|Dmitri_Mendeleev| |_predicted|Mendeleevs_Predicted_Elements|  its existence and some of its  |properties|Chemical_Property|  from its position on his  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , and called the element  ekasilicon . Nearly two decades later, in 1886,  |Clemens_Winkler|Clemens_Winkler|  found the new element along with  |silver|Silver|  and  |sulfur|Sulfur| , in a rare mineral called  |argyrodite|Argyrodite| . Although the new element somewhat resembled  |arsenic|Arsenic|  and  |antimony|Antimony|  in appearance, the combining ratios in  |compounds|Chemical_Compound|  agreed with Mendeleevs predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country,  |Germany|German_Empire| . Today, germanium is mined primarily from  |sphalerite|Sphalerite|  , though germanium is also recovered commercially from  |silver|Silver| ,  |lead|Lead| , and  |copper|Copper| |ores|Ore| .     Elemental germanium is used as a semiconductor in  |transistors|Transistor|  and various other electronic devices. Historically, the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based entirely on germanium. Presently, the major end uses are  |fibre_optic|Fibre_Optic|  systems,  |infrared_optics|Infrared_Vision| ,  |solar_cell|Solar_Cell|  applications, and  |light_emitting_diodes|Light_Emitting_Diode|  . Germanium compounds are also used for  |polymerization|Polymerization|  catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of  |nanowires|Nanowire| . This element forms a large number of  |organogermanium_compounds|Organogermanium_Compound| , such as  |tetraethylgermanium|Tetraethylgermanium| , useful in  |organometallic_chemistry|Organometallic_Chemistry| . Germanium is considered a  |technology_critical_element|Technology_Critical_Element| .     Germanium is not thought to be an essential element for any  |living_organism|Organic_Chemistry| . Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminium, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral  |toxicity|Toxicity| . However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are  |nephrotoxic|Nephrotoxic| , and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with  |halogens|Halogen|  and  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  are irritants and toxins.             In his report on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist  |Dmitri_Mendeleev|Dmitri_Mendeleev|  predicted the existence of several unknown  |chemical_elements|Chemical_Element| , including one that would fill a gap in the  |carbon_family|Group_14_Element| , located between  |silicon|Silicon|  and  |tin|Tin| .  Because of its position in his periodic table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon , and he estimated its  |atomic_weight|Atomic_Weight|  to be 70 .       In mid-1885, at a mine near  |Freiberg_Saxony|Freiberg_Saxony| , a new  |mineral|Mineral|  was discovered and named  argyrodite  because of its high  |silver|Silver|  content. The chemist  |Clemens_Winkler|Clemens_Winkler|  analyzed this new mineral, which proved to be a combination of silver, sulfur, and a new element. Winkler was able to isolate the new element in 1886 and found it similar to  |antimony|Antimony| . He initially considered the new element to be eka-antimony, but was soon convinced that it was instead eka-silicon.  Before Winkler published his results on the new element, he decided that he would name his element neptunium, since the recent discovery of planet  |Neptune|Neptune|  in 1846 had similarly been preceded by mathematical predictions of its existence. However, the name neptunium had already been given to another proposed chemical element . So instead, Winkler named the new element germanium  in honor of his homeland. Argyrodite proved empirically to be Ag 8 GeS 6 .   Because this new element showed some similarities with the elements  |arsenic|Arsenic|  and antimony, its proper place in the periodic table was under consideration, but its similarities with Dmitri Mendeleevs predicted element ekasilicon confirmed that place on the periodic table.  With further material from 500  kg of ore from the mines in Saxony, Winkler confirmed the chemical properties of the new element in 1887.   He also determined an atomic weight of 72.32 by analyzing pure  |germanium_tetrachloride|Germanium_Tetrachloride|  , while  |Lecoq_de_Boisbaudran|Lecoq_De_Boisbaudran|  deduced 72.3 by a comparison of the lines in the spark  |spectrum|Spectrum|  of the element.      Winkler was able to prepare several new compounds of germanium, including  |fluorides|Germanium_Fluoride| ,  |chlorides|Germanium_Chloride| ,  |sulfides|Germanium_Sulfide|  ,  |dioxide|Germanium_Dioxide| , and  |tetraethylgermane|Tetraethylgermane|  , the first organogermane. The physical data from those compounds—which corresponded well with Mendeleevs predictions—made the discovery an important confirmation of Mendeleevs idea of element  |periodicity|Periodic_Table| . Here is a comparison between the prediction and Winklers data:            Until the late 1930s, germanium was thought to be a poorly conducting  |metal|Metal| .  Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an  |electronic|Electronics|  semiconductor were recognized. During  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , small amounts of germanium were used in some special  |electronic_devices|Electronics| , mostly  |diodes|Diode| .   The first major use was the point-contact  |Schottky_diodes|Schottky_Diode|  for  |radar|Radar|  pulse detection during the War. The first  |silicon_germanium|Silicon_Germanium|  alloys were obtained in 1955.  Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, but by the end of the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached .      The development of the germanium  |transistor|Transistor|  in 1948  opened the door to countless applications of  |solid_state_electronics|Solid_State| .  From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and  |rectifiers|Rectifier| .  For example, the company that became  |Fairchild_Semiconductor|Fairchild_Semiconductor|  was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved in the early years of  |semiconductor_electronics|Solid_State_Electronics| .      Meanwhile, the demand for germanium for  |fiber_optic|Fiber_Optics|  communication networks, infrared  |night_vision|Night_Vision|  systems, and  |polymerization|Polymerization| |_catalysts|Catalysts|  increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption in 2000. The US government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material, calling for a 146   |ton|Short_Ton|   supply in the national defense stockpile in 1987.     Germanium differs from silicon in that the supply is limited by the availability of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and  |quartz|Quartz| . While silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg, the price of germanium was almost $800 per kg.         Under  |standard_conditions|Standard_Conditions| , germanium is a brittle, silvery-white, semi-metallic element. This form constitutes an  |allotrope|Allotrope|  known as α-germanium, which has a metallic luster and a  |diamond_cubic_crystal_structure|Diamond_Cubic| , the same as  |diamond|Diamond| . While in crystal form, germanium has a displacement threshold energy of 19.7~  .  At pressures above 120  |kbar|Bar| , germanium becomes the allotrope β-germanium with the same structure as β- |tin|Tin| . Like silicon,  |gallium|Gallium| ,  |bismuth|Bismuth| ,  |antimony|Antimony| , and  |water|Water| , germanium is one of the few substances that expands as it solidifies  from the molten state.     Germanium is a  |semiconductor|Semiconductor| .  |Zone_refining|Zone_Refining|  techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 10 10 ,        making it one of the purest materials ever obtained.        The first metallic material discovered to become a  |superconductor|Superconductor|  in the presence of an extremely strong  |electromagnetic_field|Electromagnetic_Field|  was an  |alloy_of_germanium_uranium_and_rhodium|Uranium_Rhodium_Germanium| .          Pure germanium suffers from the forming of  |whiskers|Whisker|  by spontaneous  |screw_dislocations|Screw_Dislocation| . If a whisker grows long enough to touch another part of the assembly or a metallic packaging, it can effectively  |shunt_out|Shunt|  a  |p_n_junction|P_N_Junction| . This is one of the primary reasons for the failure of old germanium diodes and transistors.            Elemental germanium starts to oxidize slowly in air at around 250  °C, forming  |GeO_2_|Germanium_Dioxide|  .  Germanium is insoluble in dilute  |acids|Acids|  and  |alkalis|Alkalis|  but dissolves slowly in hot concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids and reacts violently with molten alkalis to produce  |germanates|Germanate|  . Germanium occurs mostly in the  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  +4 although many +2 compounds are known.  Other oxidation states are rare: +3 is found in compounds such as Ge 2 Cl 6 , and +3 and +1 are found on the surface of oxides,  or negative oxidation states in  |germanides|Germanide| , such as −4 in . Germanium cluster anions  such as Ge 4 2− , Ge 9 4− , Ge 9 2− , 6− have been prepared by the extraction from alloys containing alkali metals and germanium in liquid ammonia in the presence of  |ethylenediamine|Ethylenediamine|  or a  |cryptand|Cryptand| .  The oxidation states of the element in these ions are not integers—similar to the  |ozonides|Ozonide|  O 3 − .     Two  |oxides|Oxide|  of germanium are known:  |germanium_dioxide|Germanium_Dioxide|   and  |germanium_monoxide|Germanium_Monoxide| , .  The dioxide, GeO 2 can be obtained by roasting  |germanium_disulfide|Germanium_Disulfide|  , and is a white powder that is only slightly soluble in water but reacts with alkalis to form germanates. The monoxide, germanous oxide, can be obtained by the high temperature reaction of GeO 2 with Ge metal. The dioxide exhibits the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light, but transparency to  |infrared|Infrared|  light.    |Bismuth_germanate|Bismuth_Germanate| , Bi 4 Ge 3 O 12 , is used as a  |scintillator|Scintillator| .       |Binary_compounds|Binary_Compound|  with other  |chalcogens|Chalcogen|  are also known, such as the di |sulfide|Sulfide|  , di |selenide|Selenide|  , and the  |monosulfide|Germanium_Monosulfide|  , selenide , and  |telluride|Telluride|  . GeS 2 forms as a white precipitate when hydrogen sulfide is passed through strongly acid solutions containing Ge. The disulfide is appreciably soluble in water and in solutions of caustic alkalis or alkaline sulfides. Nevertheless, it is not soluble in acidic water, which allowed Winkler to discover the element.  By heating the disulfide in a current of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| , the monosulfide is formed, which sublimes in thin plates of a dark color and metallic luster, and is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis. Upon melting with  |alkaline_carbonates|Alkali_Metal_Compound|  and  |sulfur|Sulfur| , germanium compounds form salts known as thiogermanates.         Four tetra |halides|Halides|  are known. Under normal conditions GeI 4 is a solid, GeF 4 a gas and the others volatile liquids. For example,  |germanium_tetrachloride|Germanium_Tetrachloride| , GeCl 4 , is obtained as a colorless fuming liquid boiling at 83.1  °C by heating the metal with chlorine. All the tetrahalides are readily hydrolyzed to hydrated germanium dioxide. GeCl 4 is used in the production of organogermanium compounds. All four dihalides are known and in contrast to the tetrahalides are polymeric solids. Additionally Ge 2 Cl 6 and some higher compounds of formula Ge n Cl 2n+2 are known. The unusual compound Ge 6 Cl 16 has been prepared that contains the Ge 5 Cl 12 unit with a  |neopentane|Neopentane|  structure.       |Germane|Germane|  is a compound similar in structure to  |methane|Methane| . Polygermanes—compounds that are similar to  |alkanes|Alkane| —with formula Ge n H 2n+2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH 4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH 3 which contain the GeH 3 −  |anion|Anion| . The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.        The first  |organogermanium_compound|Organogermanium_Compound|  was synthesized by Winkler in 1887; the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with  |diethylzinc|Diethylzinc|  yielded  |tetraethylgermane|Tetraethylgermane|  . Organogermanes of the type R 4 Ge  such as  |tetramethylgermane|Tetramethylgermane|   and tetraethylgermane are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor  |germanium_tetrachloride|Germanium_Tetrachloride|  and alkyl nucleophiles. Organic germanium hydrides such as  |isobutylgermane|Isobutylgermane|   were found to be less hazardous and may be used as a liquid substitute for toxic  |germane|Germane|  gas in  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  applications. Many germanium  |reactive_intermediates|Reactive_Intermediate|  are known:  |germyl|_Yl| |free_radicals|Free_Radical| , germylenes , and germynes .   The organogermanium compound  |2_carboxyethylgermasesquioxane|Propagermanium|  was first reported in the 1970s, and for a while was used as a dietary supplement and thought to possibly have anti-tumor qualities.     Using a ligand called Eind germanium is able to form a double bond with oxygen . Germanium hydride and germanium tetrahydride are very flammable and even explosive when mixed with air.           Germanium occurs in 5 natural  |isotopes|Isotope| : , , , , and . Of these,  is very slightly radioactive, decaying by  |double_beta_decay|Double_Beta_Decay|  with a  |half_life|Half_Life|  of .  is the most common isotope, having a  |natural_abundance|Natural_Abundance|  of approximately 36%.  is the least common with a natural abundance of approximately 7%.  When bombarded with alpha particles, the isotope  will generate stable , releasing high energy electrons in the process. Because of this, it is used in combination with  |radon|Radon|  for  |nuclear_batteries|Atomic_Battery| . Perreault, Bruce A. , US Patent 7800286, issued September 21, 2010.      At least 27  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 58 to 89. The most stable of these is , decaying by  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  with a half-life of ays. The least stable is , with a half-life of . While most of germaniums radioisotopes decay by  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| ,  and  decay by  delayed  |proton_emission|Proton_Emission| .  through  isotopes also exhibit minor  delayed  |neutron_emission|Neutron_Emission|  decay paths.             Germanium is created by  |stellar_nucleosynthesis|Stellar_Nucleosynthesis| , mostly by the  |s_process|S_Process|  in  |asymptotic_giant_branch|Asymptotic_Giant_Branch|  stars. The s-process is a slow  |neutron|Neutron|  capture of lighter elements inside pulsating  |red_giant|Red_Giant|  stars.  Germanium has been detected in some of the most distant stars  and in the atmosphere of Jupiter.      Germaniums abundance  |in_the_Earths_crust|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  is approximately 1.6   |ppm|Parts_Per_Million| .  Only a few minerals like  |argyrodite|Argyrodite| ,  |briartite|Briartite| ,  |germanite|Germanite| , and  |renierite|Renierite|  contain appreciable amounts of germanium.  Only few of them are, very rarely, found in mineable amounts.   & v2   Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction from the final ore concentrate. An unusual natural enrichment process causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams, discovered by  |Victor_Moritz_Goldschmidt|Victor_Moritz_Goldschmidt|  during a broad survey for germanium deposits.   The highest concentration ever found was in  |Hartley|Hartley_Northumberland|  coal ash with as much as 1.6% germanium. The coal deposits near  |Xilinhaote|Xilinhaote| ,  |Inner_Mongolia|Inner_Mongolia| , contain an estimated 1600   |tonnes|Tonne|  of germanium. germanium hydride and germanium tetrahydride are very flammable and even explosive when mixed with air.       About 118   |tonnes|Tonne|  of germanium was produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China , Russia and United States . Germanium is recovered as a by-product from  |sphalerite|Sphalerite| |_zinc|Zinc|  ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%,  especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive  |Zn|Zinc| – |Pb|Lead| – |Cu|Copper|  deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits.  A recent study found that at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by  |Mississippi_Valley_type_deposits|Carbonate_Hosted_Lead_Zinc_Ore_Deposits| , while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves.   In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.            While it is produced mainly from  |sphalerite|Sphalerite| , it is also found in  |silver|Silver| ,  |lead|Lead| , and  |copper|Copper|  ores. Another source of germanium is  |fly_ash|Fly_Ash|  of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium. Russia and China used this as a source for germanium.  Russias deposits are located in the far east of  |Sakhalin|Sakhalin|  Island, and northeast of  |Vladivostok|Vladivostok| . The deposits in China are located mainly in the  |lignite|Lignite|  mines near  |Lincang|Lincang| ,  |Yunnan|Yunnan| ; coal is also mined near  |Xilinhaote|Xilinhaote| ,  |Inner_Mongolia|Inner_Mongolia| .     The ore concentrates are mostly  |sulfidic|Sulfide| ; they are converted to the  |oxides|Oxide|  by heating under air in a process known as  |roasting|Roasting| |Waelz_process|Waelz_Process| , the residing Waelz oxide is leached a second time. The  |dioxide|Germanium_Dioxide|  is obtained as precipitate and converted with  |chlorine|Chlorine|  gas or hydrochloric acid to  |germanium_tetrachloride|Germanium_Tetrachloride| , which has a low boiling point and can be isolated by distillation:     : GeO 2 + 4 HCl → GeCl 4 + 2 H 2 O   : GeO 2 + 2 Cl 2 → GeCl 4 + O 2     Germanium tetrachloride is either hydrolyzed to the oxide or purified by fractional distillation and then hydrolyzed. The highly pure GeO 2 is now suitable for the production of germanium glass. It is reduced to the element by reacting it with hydrogen, producing germanium suitable for infrared optics and semiconductor production:     : GeO 2 + 2 H 2 → Ge + 2 H 2 O     The germanium for steel production and other industrial processes is normally reduced using carbon:      : GeO 2 + C → Ge + CO 2       The major end uses for germanium in 2007, worldwide, were estimated to be: 35% for  |fiber_optics|Fiber_Optic| , 30%  |infrared_optics|Infrared_Vision| , 15%  |polymerization|Polymerization|  catalysts, and 15% electronics and solar electric applications. The remaining 5% went into such uses as phosphors, metallurgy, and chemotherapy.          The notable properties of  |germania|Germanium_Dioxide|  are its high  |index_of_refraction|Refractive_Index|  and its low  |optical_dispersion|Dispersion| . These make it especially useful for  |wide_angle_camera_lens|Wide_Angle_Camera_Lens| es,  |microscopy|Microscopy| , and the core part of  |optical_fibers|Optical_Fiber| .   It has replaced  |titania|Titanium_Dioxide|  as the  |dopant|Dopant|  for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle.  At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption.  |GeSbTe|Gesbte|  is a  |phase_change_material|Phase_Change_Material|  used for its optic properties, such as that used in  |rewritable_DVDs|Dvd_Rw| .      Because germanium is transparent in the infrared wavelengths, it is an important  |infrared|Infrared|  optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in  |thermal_imaging_cameras|Thermographic_Camera|  working in the 8 to 14   |micron|Micrometre|  range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile  |night_vision|Night_Vision| , and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared  |spectroscopes|Spectroscope|  and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive  |infrared_detectors|Infrared_Photography| . It has a very high  |refractive_index|Refractive_Index|  and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of  |diamond_like_carbon|Diamond_Like_Carbon|  , refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.          |Silicon_germanium|Silicon_Germanium|  alloys are rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material for high-speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilizing the properties of Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone.  Silicon-germanium is beginning to replace  |gallium_arsenide|Gallium_Arsenide|  in wireless communications devices. The SiGe chips, with high-speed properties, can be made with low-cost, well-established production techniques of the  |silicon_chip|Silicon_Chip|  industry.      |Solar_panels|Solar_Panel|  are a major use of germanium. Germanium is the substrate of the wafers for high-efficiency  |multijunction_photovoltaic_cells|Multijunction_Photovoltaic_Cell|  for space applications. High-brightness LEDs, used for automobile headlights and to backlight LCD screens, are an important application.     Because germanium and  |gallium_arsenide|Gallium_Arsenide|  have very similar lattice constants, germanium substrates can be used to make gallium arsenide  |solar_cells|Solar_Cell| .  The  |Mars_Exploration_Rovers|Mars_Exploration_Rover|  and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells.      Germanium-on-insulator substrates are seen as a potential replacement for silicon on miniaturized chips. CMOS circuit based on GeOI substrates has been reported recently.  Other uses in electronics include  |phosphors|Phosphor|  in  |fluorescent_lamps|Fluorescent_Lamp|  and solid-state light-emitting diodes . Germanium transistors are still used in some  |effects_pedals|Effects_Pedal|  by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the  |_fuzz_tone|Distortion|  from the early  |rock_and_roll|Rock_And_Roll|  era, most notably the  |Dallas_Arbiter_Fuzz_Face|Fuzz_Face| .           Germanium dioxide is also used in  |catalysts|Catalyst|  for  |polymerization|Polymerization|  in the production of  |polyethylene_terephthalate|Polyethylene_Terephthalate|  .  The high brilliance of this polyester is especially favored for PET bottles marketed in Japan. In the United States, germanium is not used for polymerization catalysts.     Due to the similarity between silica and germanium dioxide , the silica stationary phase in some  |gas_chromatography|Gas_Chromatography|  columns can be replaced by GeO 2 .      In recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In  |sterling_silver|Sterling_Silver|  alloys, for instance, it reduces  |firescale|Firescale| , increases tarnish resistance, and improves precipitation hardening. A tarnish-proof silver alloy trademarked  |Argentium|Argentium_Sterling_Silver|  contains 1.2% germanium.      |Semiconductor_detectors|Semiconductor_Detectorgermanium_Detector|  made of single crystal high-purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security.  Germanium is useful for  |monochromators|Crystal_Monochromator|  for  |beamlines|Beamline|  used in  |single_crystal|Single_Crystal| |_neutron_scattering|Neutron_Scattering|  and  |synchrotron_X_ray|Synchrotron_Light|  diffraction. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and  |high_energy_X_ray|High_Energy_X_Rays|  applications.  Crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for  |gamma_spectroscopy|Gamma_Spectroscopy|  and the search for  |dark_matter|Dark_Matter| .  Germanium crystals are also used in X-ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur. Eugene P. Bertin . Principles and practice of X-ray spectrometric analysis, Chapter 5.4 – Analyzer crystals, Table 5.1, p. 123; Plenum Press     Germanium is emerging as an important material for  |spintronics|Spintronics|  and spin-based  |quantum_computing|Quantum_Computing|  applications. In 2010, researchers demonstrated room temperature spin transport  and more recently donor electron spins in germanium has been shown to have very long  |coherence_times|Coherence_Time| .          Germanium is not considered essential to the health of plants or animals. Germanium in the environment has little or no health impact. This is primarily because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and  |carbon|Carbon| aceous materials, and the various industrial and electronic applications involve very small quantities that are not likely to be ingested. For similar reasons, end-use germanium has little impact on the environment as a biohazard. Some reactive intermediate compounds of germanium are poisonous .      Germanium supplements, made from both organic and inorganic germanium, have been marketed as an  |alternative_medicine|Alternative_Medicine|  capable of treating  |leukemia|Leukemia|  and  |lung_cancer|Lung_Cancer| . There is, however, no  |medical_evidence|Evidence_Based_Medicine|  of benefit; some evidence suggests that such supplements are actively harmful.      Some germanium compounds have been administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted in some cases of  |renal|Renal|  dysfunction,  |hepatic_steatosis|Hepatic_Steatosis| , and peripheral  |neuropathy|Neuropathy|  in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than  |endogenous|Endogenous|  levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide , has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.       |U_S_Food_and_Drug_Administration|U_S_Food_And_Drug_Administration|  research has concluded that inorganic germanium, when used as a  |nutritional_supplement|Nutritional_Supplement| , presents potential human  |health_hazard|Health_Hazard|  .      Certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to  |mammals|Mammal| , but have toxic effects against certain  |bacteria|Bacterium| .        Some of germaniums artificially produced compounds are quite reactive and present an immediate hazard to human health on exposure. For example,  |germanium_chloride|Germanium_Tetrachloride|  and  |germane|Germane|  are a liquid and gas, respectively, that can be very irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.
