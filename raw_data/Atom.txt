              An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary  |matter|Matter|  that constitutes a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element| . Every  |solid|Solid| ,  |liquid|Liquid| ,  |gas|Gas| , and  |plasma|Plasma|  is composed of neutral or  |ionized|Ionized|  atoms. Atoms are extremely small; typical sizes are around 100   |picometers|Picometer|  . They are  |so_small|Microscopic_Scale|  that accurately predicting their behavior using  |classical_physics|Classical_Physics|   – as if they were  |billiard_balls|Billiard_Ball| , for example  – is not possible. This is due to  |quantum_effects|Quantum_Mechanics| . Current atomic models now use  |quantum_principles|Further_Developments_In_Quantum_Physics|  to better explain and predict this behavior.     Every atom is composed of a  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  and one or more  |electrons|Electron|  bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more  |protons|Proton|  and a number of  |neutrons|Neutron| . Only the most common variety of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  has no neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called  |nucleons|Nucleon| . More than 99.94% of an atoms  |mass|Mass|  is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive  |electric_charge|Electric_Charge|  whereas the electrons have a negative electric charge. The neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively. These atoms are called  |ions|Ion| .     The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the  |electromagnetic_force|Electromagnetic_Force| . The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force| . This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. In this case, the nucleus shatters and  |leaves_behind_different_elements|Nuclear_Transmutation| . This is a kind of  |nuclear_decay|Nuclear_Decay| . All electrons, nucleons, and nuclei alike are  |subatomic_particles|Subatomic_Particle| . The behavior of electrons in atoms is  |closer_to_a_wave_than_a_particle|Wave–Particle_Duality| .     The number of protons in the nucleus, called the  atomic number , defines to which chemical element the atom belongs. For example, each  |copper|Copper|  atom contains 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the  |isotope|Isotope|  of the element. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by  |chemical_bonds|Chemical_Bond|  to form  |chemical_compounds|Chemical_Compound|  such as  |molecules|Molecule|  or  |crystals|Crystal| . The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature.  |Chemistry|Chemistry|  is the discipline that studies these changes.                 The idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word atomos, meaning uncuttable , was coined by the  |ancient_Greek_philosophers|Ancient_Greek_Philosophy| |Leucippus|Leucippus|  and his pupil  |Democritus|Democritus|  .     Democritus taught that atoms were infinite in number, uncreated, and eternal, and that the qualities of an object result from the kind of atoms that compose it. Democrituss atomism was refined and elaborated by the later philosopher  |Epicurus|Epicurus|  . During the  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages| , atomism was mostly forgotten in western Europe, but survived among some groups of Islamic philosophers. During the twelfth century, atomism became known again in western Europe through references to it in the newly-rediscovered writings of  |Aristotle|Aristotle| .     In the fourteenth century, the rediscovery of major works describing atomist teachings, including  |Lucretiuss|Lucretius|   De rerum natura  and  |Diogenes_Laërtiuss|Diogenes_Laërtius|   Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers , led to increased scholarly attention on the subject. Nonetheless, because atomism was associated with the philosophy of  |Epicureanism|Epicureanism| , which contradicted orthodox Christian teachings, belief in atoms was not considered acceptable. The French Catholic priest  |Pierre_Gassendi|Pierre_Gassendi|  revived Epicurean atomism with modifications, arguing that atoms were created by God and, though extremely numerous, are not infinite. Gassendis modified theory of atoms was popularized in France by the physician  |François_Bernier|François_Bernier|  and in England by the natural philosopher  |Walter_Charleton|Walter_Charleton|  . The chemist  |Robert_Boyle|Robert_Boyle|  and the physicist  |Isaac_Newton|Isaac_Newton|  both defended atomism and, by the end of the seventeenth century, it had become accepted by portions of the scientific community.          In the early 1800s,  |John_Dalton|John_Dalton|  used the concept of atoms to explain why  |elements|Chemical_Element|  always react in ratios of small whole numbers . For instance, there are two types of  |tin_oxide|Tin_Oxide| . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in multiples of discrete units — in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.      Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  far better than it absorbs  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| . Dalton, John.   , in Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester. 1803. Retrieved on August 29, 2007. Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules .       In 1827,  |botanist|Botany| |Robert_Brown|Robert_Brown|  used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as  |Brownian_motion|Brownian_Motion|  . This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905,  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein|  proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first  |statistical_physics|Statistical_Physics|  analysis of  |Brownian_motion|Brownian_Motion| .    French physicist  |Jean_Perrin|Jean_Perrin|  used Einsteins work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying  |Daltons_atomic_theory|Daltons_Atomic_Theory| .          The physicist  |J.J._Thomson|J.J._Thomson|  measured the mass of  |cathode_rays|Cathode_Ray| , showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom,  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| . Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first  subatomic  particle to be discovered, which he originally called  corpuscle  but was later named electron, after particles postulated by  |George_Johnstone_Stoney|George_Johnstone_Stoney|  in 1874. He also showed they were identical to particles given off by  |photoelectric|Photoelectric_Effect|  and radioactive materials.  It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry  |electric_currents|Electric_Current|  in metal wires, and carry the negative electric charge within atoms. Thomson was given the 1906  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  for this work. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter. Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the  |plum_pudding_model|Plum_Pudding_Model| .          In 1909,  |Hans_Geiger|Hans_Geiger|  and  |Ernest_Marsden|Ernest_Marsden| , under the direction of  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford| , bombarded a metal foil with  |alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomsons model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomsons model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.       While experimenting with the products of  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| , in 1913  |radiochemist|Radiochemistry| |Frederick_Soddy|Frederick_Soddy|  discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| . The term  |isotope|Isotope|  was coined by  |Margaret_Todd|Margaret_Todd|  as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for  |isotope_separation|Isotope_Separation|  through his work on  |ionized_gas|Ionized_Gas| es, which subsequently led to the discovery of  |stable_isotopes|Stable_Isotope| .               In 1913 the physicist  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr|  proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable  and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.     Later in the same year  |Henry_Moseley|Henry_Moseley|  provided additional experimental evidence in favor of  |Niels_Bohrs_theory|Bohr_Model| . These results refined  |Ernest_Rutherfords|Ernest_Rutherford|  and  |Antonius_Van_den_Broeks|Antonius_Van_Den_Broek|  model, which proposed that the atom contains in its  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  a number of positive  |nuclear_charges|Nuclear_Charge|  that is equal to its number in the periodic table. Until these experiments,  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.         |Chemical_bonds|Chemical_Bond|  between atoms were now explained, by  |Gilbert_Newton_Lewis|Gilbert_Newton_Lewis|  in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons. As the  |chemical_properties|Chemical_Property|  of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the  |periodic_law|Periodic_Law| ,  in 1919 the American chemist  |Irving_Langmuir|Irving_Langmuir|  suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of  |electron_shells|Electron_Shell|  about the nucleus.       The  |Stern–Gerlach_experiment|Stern–Gerlach_Experiment|  of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of atomic properties. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split in a way correlated with the direction of an atoms angular momentum, or  |spin|Spin| . As this spin direction is initially random, the beam would be expected to deflect in a random direction. Instead, the beam was split into two directional components, corresponding to the atomic  |spin|Spin|  being oriented up or down with respect to the magnetic field.     In 1925  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg|  published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics . One year earlier, in 1924,  |Louis_de_Broglie|Louis_De_Broglie|  had proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves and, in 1926,  |Erwin_Schrödinger|Erwin_Schrödinger|  used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional  |waveforms|Waveform|  rather than point particles.     A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the  |position|Point|  and  |momentum|Momentum|  of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the  |uncertainty_principle|Uncertainty_Principle| , formulated by  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg|  in 1927. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.    This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and  |spectral|Spectral_Line|  patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described  |atomic_orbital|Atomic_Orbital|  zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.       The development of the  |mass_spectrometer|Mass_Spectrometry|  allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atoms mass to its charge. The chemist  |Francis_William_Aston|Francis_William_Aston|  used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass|  of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the  |whole_number_rule|Whole_Number_Rule| . The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the  |neutron|Neutron| , an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the  |proton|Proton| , by the physicist  |James_Chadwick|James_Chadwick|  in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.       In 1938, the German chemist  |Otto_Hahn|Otto_Hahn| , a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get  |transuranium_elements|Transuranium_Element| . Instead, his chemical experiments showed  |barium|Barium|  as a product. A year later,  |Lise_Meitner|Lise_Meitner|  and her nephew  |Otto_Frisch|Otto_Frisch|  verified that Hahns result were the first experimental nuclear fission. In 1944, Hahn received the  |Nobel_prize|Nobel_Prize|  in chemistry. Despite Hahns efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.     In the 1950s, the development of improved  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator|  and  |particle_detectors|Particle_Detector|  allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies. Neutrons and protons were found to be  |hadrons|Hadron| , or composites of smaller particles called  |quarks|Quark| . The  |standard_model_of_particle_physics|Standard_Model_Of_Particle_Physics|  was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.            Though the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various  |subatomic_particles|Subatomic_Particle| . The constituent particles of an atom are the  |electron|Electron| , the  |proton|Proton|  and the  |neutron|Neutron| ; all three are  |fermions|Fermion| . However, the  |hydrogen-1|Hydrogen|  atom has no neutrons and the  |hydron_ion|Hydron|  has no electrons.     The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at , with a negative  |electrical_charge|Electric_Charge|  and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.  It was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of  |neutrino|Neutrino|  mass. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an  |ion|Ion| . Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to  |J.J._Thomson|J.J._Thomson| ; see  |history_of_subatomic_physics|History_Of_Subatomic_Physics|  for details.     Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at . The number of protons in an atom is called its  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number| .  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford|  observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it  |proton|Proton| .     Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of the electron, or .  Mohr, P.J.; Taylor, B.N. and Newell, D.B. ,   . The database was developed by J. Baker, M. Douma, and S. Kotochigova. . National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899. Neutrons are the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but their mass can be reduced by the  |nuclear_binding_energy|Nuclear_Binding_Energy| . Neutrons and protons  have comparable dimensions—on the order of —although the surface of these particles is not sharply defined.  The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist  |James_Chadwick|James_Chadwick| .     In the  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model|  of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of  |elementary_particles|Elementary_Particle|  called  |quarks|Quark| . There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two  |up_quarks|Up_Quark|   and one  |down_quark|Down_Quark|  . Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.     The quarks are held together by the  |strong_interaction|Strong_Interaction|  , which is mediated by  |gluons|Gluon| . The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force| , which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties . The gluon is a member of the family of  |gauge_bosons|Gauge_Boson| , which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.               All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus| , and are collectively called  |nucleons|Nucleon| . The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07     |fm|Femtometre| , where A is the total number of nucleons.  This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10 5  fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the  |residual_strong_force|Residual_Strong_Force| . At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the  |electrostatic_force|Electrostatic_Force|  that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.      Atoms of the same  |element|Chemical_Element|  have the same number of protons, called the  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number| . Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the  |isotope|Isotope|  of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the  |nuclide|Nuclide| . The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| .     The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as  |fermions|Fermion| . Fermions obey the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle|  which prohibits  identical  fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.     A nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match. As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay. However, with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus, which slightly modifies this trend of equal numbers of protons to neutrons.          The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force.  |Nuclear_fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the  |coulomb_barrier|Coulomb_Barrier| —and fuse together into a single nucleus.  |Nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission|  is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.     If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy , as described by  |Albert_Einsteins|Albert_Einstein| |mass–energy_equivalence|Mass–Energy_Equivalence|  formula, Emc2 , where m is the mass loss and c is the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light| . This deficit is part of the  |binding_energy|Binding_Energy|  of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.      The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than  |iron|Iron|  and  |nickel|Nickel| —a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an  |exothermic_process|Exothermic_Reaction|  that releases more energy than is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in  |stars|Star|  a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per  |nucleon|Nucleon|  in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass| es higher than about 60, is an  |endothermic_process|Endothermic_Reaction| . These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the  |hydrostatic_equilibrium|Hydrostatic_Equilibrium|  of a star.               The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the  |electromagnetic_force|Electromagnetic_Force| . This force binds the electrons inside an  |electrostatic|Electrostatic| |potential_well|Potential_Well|  surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.     Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a  |particle_and_a_wave|Wave–Particle_Duality| . The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional  |standing_wave|Standing_Wave| —a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an  |atomic_orbital|Atomic_Orbital| , a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured. Only a discrete  set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form. Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.                Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular  |energy_level|Energy_Level|  of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a  |photon|Photon|  with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through  |spontaneous_emission|Spontaneous_Emission| , an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for  |atomic_spectral_lines|Atomic_Spectral_Line| .     The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the  |electron_binding_energy|Electron_Binding_Energy| —is far less than the  |binding_energy_of_nucleons|Binding_Energy| . For example, it requires only 13.6  eV to strip a  |ground-state|Stationary_State|  electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23  million eV for splitting a  |deuterium|Deuterium|  nucleus. Atoms are  |electrically|Electric_Charge|  neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called  |ions|Ion| . Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to  |bond|Chemical_Bond|  into  |molecules|Molecule|  and other types of  |chemical_compounds|Chemical_Compound|  like  |ionic|Ionic_Crystal|  and  |covalent|Covalent_Bond|  network  |crystals|Crystallization| .               By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element| . Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons , one neutron , two neutrons  and  |more_than_two_neutrons|Isotopes_Of_Hydrogen| . The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  up to the 118-proton element  |oganesson|Oganesson| . All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive, although the radioactivity of element 83  is so slight as to be practically negligible.      About 339 nuclides occur naturally on  |Earth|Earth| , of which 254 have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as  |stable_isotopes|Stable_Isotope|  . However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even  |in_theory|List_Of_Nuclides| . Another 164 have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as stable . An additional 34 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the  |solar_system|Solar_System| . This collection of 288 nuclides are known as  |primordial_nuclides|Primordial_Nuclide| . Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay , or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment . For more recent updates see  .      For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one  |stable_isotope|Stable_Isotope|  exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element  |tin|Tin| . Elements  |43|Technetium| ,  |61|Promethium| , and all elements numbered  |83|Bismuth|  or higher have no stable isotopes. CRC Handbook .      Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain magic numbers of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the  |shell_model|Nuclear_Shell_Model|  of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons:  |hydrogen-2|Hydrogen-2|  ,  |lithium-6|Lithium-6| ,  |boron-10|Boron-10|  and  |nitrogen-14|Nitrogen-14| . Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years:  |potassium-40|Potassium-40| ,  |vanadium-50|Vanadium-50| ,  |lanthanum-138|Lanthanum-138|  and  |tantalum-180m|Tantalum-180M| . Most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| , because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to  |nuclear_pairing_effects|Semi-Empirical_Mass_Formulapairing_Term| .             The large majority of an atoms mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles in a given atom is called the  |mass_number|Mass_Number| . It is a positive integer and dimensionless , because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is carbon-12, which has 12 nucleons .     The actual  |mass_of_an_atom_at_rest|Invariant_Mass|  is often expressed in  |daltons|Dalton|  , also called the unified atomic mass unit . This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of  |carbon-12|Carbon-12| , which is approximately .  |Hydrogen-1|Hydrogen_Atom|  has an atomic weight of 1.007825  Da. The value of this number is called the  |atomic_mass|Atomic_Mass| . A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal to its mass number times the atomic mass unit . However, this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon-12 . The heaviest  |stable_atom|Stable_Atom|  is lead-208, with a mass of .     As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of  |moles|Mole| . One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms . This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1  u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the  |unified_atomic_mass_unit|Atomic_Mass_Unit| , each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12  Da, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012  kg.           Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an  |atomic_radius|Atomic_Radius| . This is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.  However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a  |chemical_bond|Chemical_Bond| . The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms  and a  |quantum_mechanical|Quantum_Mechanics|  property known as  |spin|Spin| . On the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows . Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32   |pm|Picometre| , while one of the largest is  |caesium|Caesium|  at 225  pm.      When subjected to external forces, like  |electrical_fields|Electrical_Field| , the shape of an atom may deviate from  |spherical_symmetry|Spherical_Symmetry| . The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by  |group-theoretical|Group_Theory|  considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in  |crystals|Crystal| , where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at  |low-symmetry|Crystal_Symmetry|  lattice sites.   Significant  |ellipsoid|Ellipsoid| al deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions  and  |chalcogen|Chalcogen|  ions  in  |pyrite|Pyrite| -type compounds.     Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of  |light|Light|   so they cannot be viewed using an  |optical_microscope|Optical_Microscope| . However, individual atoms can be observed using a  |scanning_tunneling_microscope|Scanning_Tunneling_Microscope| . To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a typical human hair is about 1  million carbon atoms in width. A single drop of water contains about 2   |sextillion|Sextillion|   atoms of oxygen, and twice the number of hydrogen atoms.  A single  |carat|Carat| |diamond|Diamond|  with a mass of  contains about 10  sextillion atoms of  |carbon|Carbon| . A carat is 200  milligrams.  |By_definition|Atomic_Mass_Unit| , carbon-12 has 0.012  kg per mole. The  |Avogadro_constant|Avogadro_Constant|  defines  atoms per mole. If an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.                  Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1  fm.     The most common forms of radioactive decay are:     |Alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay| |atomic_number|Atomic_Number| .    |Beta_decay|Beta_Decay| |weak_force|Weak_Force| , and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an  |antineutrino|Antineutrino| , while proton to neutron transition causes the emission of a  |positron|Positron|  and a  |neutrino|Neutrino| . The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.    |Gamma_decay|Gamma_Decay| |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay|  include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of  |nucleons|Nucleon|  from a nucleus, or more than one  |beta_particle|Beta_Particle| . An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is  |internal_conversion|Internal_Conversion| —a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous  |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission| .     Each  |radioactive_isotope|Radioactive_Isotope|  has a characteristic decay time period—the  |half-life|Half-Life| —that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an  |exponential_decay|Exponential_Decay|  process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.            Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as  |spin|Spin| . This is analogous to the  |angular_momentum|Angular_Momentum|  of an object that is spinning around its  |center_of_mass|Center_Of_Mass| , although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced  |Planck_constant|Planck_Constant|  , with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½  ħ, or spin-½ . In an atom, electrons in motion around the  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  possess orbital  |angular_momentum|Angular_Momentum|  in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.     The  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field|  produced by an atom—its  |magnetic_moment|Magnetic_Moment| —is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| , in which no two electrons may be found in the same  |quantum_state|Quantum_State| , bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.     In  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetism|  elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an  |exchange_interaction|Exchange_Interaction| . When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field.  |Paramagnetic_materials|Paramagnetism|  have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.     The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of  |thermal_equilibrium|Thermal_Equilibrium| . However, for certain elements  it is possible to  |polarize|Spin_Polarization|  a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called  |hyperpolarization|Hyperpolarization| . This has important applications in  |magnetic_resonance_imaging|Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging| .           The  |potential_energy|Potential_Energy|  of an electron in an atom is  |negative|Negative_Number| , its dependence of its  |position|Position|  reaches the  |minimum|Minimum|   inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the  |distance|Distance|  from the nucleus  |goes_to_infinity|Limit_At_Infinity| , roughly in an  |inverse_proportion|Inverse_Proportion|  to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of  |states|Quantum_State|  centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific  |energy_level|Energy_Level| ; see  |time-independent_Schrödinger_equation|Time-Independent_Schrödinger_Equation|  for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the  |amount_of_energy_needed_to_unbind|Ionization_Potential|  the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of  |electronvolts|Electronvolt|  . The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e.  |stationary_state|Stationary_State| , while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state. The electrons energy raises when  n  increases because the distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on  is caused not by  |electrostatic_potential|Electrostatic_Potential|  of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.     For an electron to  |transition_between_two_different_states|Atomic_Electron_Transition| , e.g.  |ground_state|Ground_State|  to first  |excited_state|Excited_State| , it must absorb or emit a  |photon|Photon|  at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to the  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr|  model, what can be precisely calculated by the  |Schrödinger_equation|Schrödinger_Equation| .   Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see  |Electron_properties|Atomic_Orbital| .     The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its  |frequency|Frequency| , so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the  |electromagnetic_spectrum|Electromagnetic_Spectrum| .    Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.          When a continuous  |spectrum_of_energy|Electromagnetic_Spectrum|  is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark  |absorption_bands|Absorption_Band|  in the energy output.   |Spectroscopic|Spectroscopy|  measurements of the strength and width of  |atomic_spectral_lines|Atomic_Spectral_Line|  allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.     Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a  |fine_structure|Fine_Structure|  splitting. This occurs because of  |spin–orbit_coupling|Spin–Orbit_Coupling| , which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the  |Zeeman_effect|Zeeman_Effect| . This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple  |electron_configurations|Electron_Configuration|  with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external  |electric_field|Electric_Field|  can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the  |Stark_effect|Stark_Effect| .      If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause  |stimulated_emission|Stimulated_Emission|  of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make  |lasers|Laser| , which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.            Valency is the combining power of an element. It is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds. oxford dictionary – valency The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the  |valence_shell|Valence_Shell| , and the electrons in   that shell are called  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron| . The number of valence electrons determines the  |bonding|Chemical_Bond|    behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to  |chemically_react|Chemical_Reaction|  with each other in a manner that fills their outer valence shells. For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound  |sodium_chloride|Sodium_Chloride|  and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus,  |chemical_bond|Chemical_Bond| ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compounds| .     The  |chemical_elements|Chemical_Element|  are often displayed in a  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas| es.               Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as  |temperature|Temperature|  and  |pressure|Pressure| . By varying the conditions, materials can transition between  |solids|Solid| ,  |liquids|Liquid| ,  |gas|Gas| es and  |plasmas|Plasma| .  Within a state, a material can also exist in different  |allotropes|Allotropes| . An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as  |graphite|Graphite|  or  |diamond|Diamond| . Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as  |dioxygen|Dioxygen|  and  |ozone|Ozone| .     At temperatures close to  |absolute_zero|Absolute_Zero| , atoms can form a  |Bose–Einstein_condensate|Bose–Einstein_Condensate| , at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic scale.  This super-cooled collection of atoms   then behaves as a single  |super_atom|Super_Atom| , which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior.             The  |scanning_tunneling_microscope|Scanning_Tunneling_Microscope|  is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the  |quantum_tunneling|Quantum_Tunneling|  phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an  |adsorb|Adsorb| ed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom as it moves past the other permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the  |Fermi_level|Fermi_Level| |local_density_of_states|Local_Density_Of_States| .     An atom can be  |ion|Ion| ized by removing one of its electrons. The  |electric_charge|Electric_Charge|  causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field| . The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The  |mass_spectrometer|Mass_Spectrometry|  uses this principle to measure the  |mass-to-charge_ratio|Mass-To-Charge_Ratio|  of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include  |inductively_coupled_plasma_atomic_emission_spectroscopy|Inductively_Coupled_Plasma_Atomic_Emission_Spectroscopy|  and  |inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry|Inductively_Coupled_Plasma_Mass_Spectrometry| , both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.     A more area-selective method is  |electron_energy_loss_spectroscopy|Electron_Energy_Loss_Spectroscopy| , which measures the energy loss of an  |electron_beam|Electron_Beam|  within a  |transmission_electron_microscope|Transmission_Electron_Microscope|  when it interacts with a portion of a sample. The  |atom-probe_tomograph|Atom_Probe|  has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.     Spectra of  |excited_states|Excited_State|  can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant  |stars|Star| . Specific light  |wavelengths|Wavelength|  contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a  |gas-discharge_lamp|Gas-Discharge_Lamp|  containing the same element.  |Helium|Helium|  was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23  years before it was found on Earth.        |Baryonic_matter|Baryonic_Matter|  forms about 4% of the total energy density of the  |observable_Universe|Observable_Universe| , with an average density of about 0.25  particles/m 3 . Within a galaxy such as the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| , particles have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the  |interstellar_medium|Interstellar_Medium|  ranging from 10 5 to 10 9 atoms/m 3 .  The Sun is believed to be inside the  |Local_Bubble|Local_Bubble| , so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 10 3 atoms/m 3 . Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium.     Up to 95% of the Milky Ways baryonic matter are concentrated inside stars, where conditions are unfavorable for atomic matter. The total baryonic mass is about 10% of the mass of the galaxy;  the remainder of the mass is an unknown  |dark_matter|Dark_Matter| . High  |temperature|Temperature|  inside stars makes most atoms fully ionized, that is, separates all electrons from the nuclei. In  |stellar_remnants|Stellar_Remnant| —with exception of their surface layers—an immense  |pressure|Pressure|  make electron shells impossible.       Electrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the  |Big_Bang|Big_Bang| . Atomic nuclei forms in  |nucleosynthesis|Nucleosynthesis|  reactions. In about three minutes  |Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis|Big_Bang_Nucleosynthesis|  produced most of the  |helium|Helium| ,  |lithium|Lithium| , and  |deuterium|Deuterium|  in the Universe, and perhaps some of the  |beryllium|Beryllium|  and  |boron|Boron| .     Ubiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their  |binding_energy|Binding_Energy| , which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the  |temperature|Temperature|  is much higher than  |ionization_potential|Ionization_Potential| , the matter exists in the form of  |plasma|Plasma| —a gas of positively charged ions and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become  |statistically|Statistical_Physics|  favorable. Atoms became to dominate over  |charged|Electric_Charge| |particles|Particle|  380,000  years after the Big Bang—an epoch called  |recombination|Recombination| , when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.     Since the Big Bang, which produced no  |carbon|Carbon|  or  |heavier_elements|Atomic_Number| , atomic nuclei have been combined in  |stars|Star|  through the process of  |nuclear_fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  to produce more of the element  |helium|Helium| , and  the sequence of elements from carbon up to  |iron|Iron| ; see  |stellar_nucleosynthesis|Stellar_Nucleosynthesis|  for details.     Isotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through  |cosmic_ray_spallation|Cosmic_Ray_Spallation| . This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.     Elements heavier than iron were produced in  |supernovae|Supernova|  through the  |r-process|R-Process|  and in  |AGB_stars|Asymptotic_Giant_Branch|  through the  |s-process|S-Process| , both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei. Elements such as  |lead|Lead|  formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.       Most of the atoms that make up the  |Earth|Earth|  and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the  |nebula|Nebula|  that collapsed out of a  |molecular_cloud|Molecular_Cloud|  to form the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| . The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the  |age_of_the_Earth|Age_Of_The_Earth|  through  |radiometric_dating|Radiometric_Dating| . Most of the  |helium|Helium|  in the crust of the Earth  is a product of  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay| .     There are a few trace atoms on Earth that were not present at the beginning , nor are results of radioactive decay.  |Carbon-14|Carbon-14|  is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Some atoms on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions. Of the  |transuranic_elements|Transuranium_Element| —those with atomic numbers greater than 92—only  |plutonium|Plutonium|  and  |neptunium|Neptunium|  occur naturally on Earth. Transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth  and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the exception of traces of  |plutonium-244|Plutonium-244|  possibly deposited by cosmic dust. Natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by  |neutron_capture|Neutron_Capture|  in uranium ore.     The Earth contains approximately  atoms. Although small numbers of independent atoms of  |noble_gas|Noble_Gas| es exist, such as  |argon|Argon| ,  |neon|Neon| , and  |helium|Helium|  , 99% of  |the_atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere|  is bound in the form of molecules, including  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  and  |diatomic|Diatomic_Molecule| |oxygen|Oxygen|  and  |nitrogen|Nitrogen| . At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including  |water|Water| ,  |salt|Salt| ,  |silicates|Silicate|  and  |oxides|Oxide| . Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including  |crystals|Crystal|  and liquid or solid  |metals|Metal| . This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.                 While isotopes with atomic numbers higher than  |lead|Lead|  are known to be radioactive, an  |island_of_stability|Island_Of_Stability|  has been proposed for some elements with atomic numbers above 103. These  |superheavy_elements|Superheavy_Element|  may have a nucleus that is relatively stable against radioactive decay. The most likely candidate for a stable superheavy atom,  |unbihexium|Unbihexium| , has 126  protons and 184  neutrons.            Each particle of matter has a corresponding  |antimatter|Antimatter|  particle with the opposite electrical charge. Thus, the  |positron|Positron|  is a positively charged  |antielectron|Antielectron|  and the  |antiproton|Antiproton|  is a negatively charged equivalent of a  |proton|Proton| . When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of  |baryogenesis|Baryogenesis|  may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom  was synthesized at the  |CERN|Cern|  laboratory in  |Geneva|Geneva| .     Other  |exotic_atoms|Exotic_Atom|  have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive  |muon|Muon| , forming a  |muonic_atom|Muonic_Atom|.
