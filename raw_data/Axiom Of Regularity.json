Otherwise, apply the axiom of regularity to u to get an element w of u which is disjoint from u. Since w is in u, w is unranked. w is a subset of t by the definition of transitive closure. Since w is disjoint from u, every element of w is ranked. Applying the axioms of replacement and union to combine the ranks of the elements of w, we get an ordinal rank for w, to wit         . This contradicts the conclusion that w is unranked. So the assumption that u was non-empty must be false and x must have rank.       Let X and Y be sets. Then apply the axiom of regularity to the set  . We see there must be an element of  which is also disjoint from it. It must be either X or Y. By the definition of disjoint then, we must have either Y is not an element of X or vice versa.       Let the non-empty set S be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, every element of S has a non-empty intersection with S. We define a binary relation R on S by aRb :  b   S   a , which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, there is some sequence  in S satisfying a n Ra n+1  for all n in N. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such S exists.

So far, these axioms do not seem to lead to any contradiction. Subsequently, the axiom of choice and the axiom of regularity were added to exclude models with some undesirable properties.

If a theory is extended by adding an axiom or axioms, then any consequences of the original theory remain consequences of the extended theory.
