It is based on the memoir of  |Maria_von_Trapp|Maria_Von_Trapp| ,  The Story of the Trapp Family Singers . Set in Austria on the eve of the  Anschluss  in 1938, the musical tells the story of Maria, who takes a job as governess to a large family while she decides whether to become a nun. She falls in love with the children, and eventually their widowed father,  |Captain_von_Trapp|Georg_Von_Trapp| . He is ordered to accept a commission in the German navy, but he opposes the Nazis. He and Maria decide on a plan to flee Austria with the children. Many songs from the musical have become  |standards|Standard| , such as  |Edelweiss|Edelweiss|  ,  |My_Favorite_Things|My_Favorite_Things|  ,  |Climb_Evry_Mountain|Climb_Evry_Mountain|  ,  |Do_Re_Mi|Do_Re_Mi|  , and the title song  |The_Sound_of_Music|The_Sound_Of_Music|  .     The original  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  production, starring  |Mary_Martin|Mary_Martin|  and  |Theodore_Bikel|Theodore_Bikel| , opened in 1959  and won five  |Tony_Awards|Tony_Award| , including Best Musical, out of nine nominations. The first London production opened at the  |Palace_Theatre|Palace_Theatre_London|  in 1961. The show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since then. It was adapted as a  |1965_film_musical|The_Sound_Of_Music|  starring  |Julie_Andrews|Julie_Andrews|  and  |Christopher_Plummer|Christopher_Plummer| , which won five  |Academy_Awards|Academy_Awards| . The Sound of Music was the last musical written by  |Rodgers_and_Hammerstein|Rodgers_And_Hammerstein| ; Oscar Hammerstein died of stomach cancer nine months after the Broadway premiere.       After viewing  The Trapp Family , a 1956  |West_German|West_German|  film about the von Trapp family, and its 1958 sequel , stage director  |Vincent_J_Donehue|Vincent_J_Donehue|  thought that the project would be perfect for his friend  |Mary_Martin|Mary_Martin| ; Broadway producers  |Leland_Hayward|Leland_Hayward|  and Richard Halliday agreed. Nolan, 244 The producers originally envisioned a non-musical play that would be written by  |Lindsay_and_Crouse|Lindsay_And_Crouse|  and that would feature songs from the repertoire of the Trapp Family Singers. Then they decided to add an original song or two, perhaps by  |Rodgers_and_Hammerstein|Rodgers_And_Hammerstein| . But it was soon agreed that the project should feature all new songs and be a musical rather than a play.      Details of the history of the von Trapp family were altered for the musical. The real  |Georg_von_Trapp|Georg_Von_Trapp|  did live with his family in a villa in  |Aigen|Aigen| , a suburb of  |Salzburg|Salzburg| . He wrote to the  |Nonnberg_Abbey|Nonnberg_Abbey|  in 1926 asking for a nun to help tutor his sick daughter, and the  |Mother_Abbess|Virgilia_Mother_Abbess|  sent  |Maria|Maria_Von_Trapp| . His wife had died in 1922. The real Maria and Georg married at the Nonnberg Abbey in 1927. Lindsay and Crouse altered the story so that Maria was governess to all of the children, whose names and ages were changed, as was Marias original surname . The von Trapps spent some years in Austria after Maria and the Captain married and was offered a commission in  |Germanys_navy|Kriegsmarine| . Since von Trapp opposed the Nazis by that time, the family left Austria after the  Anschluss , going by train to  |Italy|Italy|  and then traveling on to London and the United States. Gearin, Joan. ,  Prologue  magazine, Winter 2005, Vol. 37, No. 4,  |National_Archives_and_Records_Administration|National_Archives_And_Records_Administration|  To make the story more dramatic, Lindsay and Crouse had the family, soon after Marias and the Captains wedding, escape over the mountains to Switzerland on foot.           In  |Salzburg_Austria|Salzburg_Austria| , just before  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , nuns from  |Nonnberg_Abbey|Nonnberg_Abbey|  sing the  Dixit Dominus . One of the  |postulants|Postulant| , Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills . She returns late to the abbey where the Mother  |Abbess|Abbess|  and the other nuns have been considering what to do about the free-spirit . Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song .  The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the  |abbey|Abbey|  to decide whether she is suited for the  |monastic|Monastic|  life. She will act as the  |governess|Governess|  to the seven children of a  |widower|Widower| ,  |Austro_Hungarian_Navy|Austro_Hungarian_Navy|  submarine Captain  |Georg_von_Trapp|Georg_Von_Trapp| .     Maria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a  |boatswains_call|Boatswains_Call| . They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music .     Rolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the oldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she . They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings  |The_Lonely_Goatherd|The_Lonely_Goatherd|  to distract them.     Captain von Trapp arrives a month later from  |Vienna|Vienna|  with Baroness Elsa Schräder and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances . Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with  |Heil|Nazi_Salute|  . The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children  |leapfrog|Leapfrog|  in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that they need him to love them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing The Sound of Music , which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schräder. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.     The Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the Nazi German  Anschluss  of Austria. Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the  |Ländler|Ländler| . When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song, So Long, Farewell . Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzberg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.     At the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her  |monastic_vows|Monastic_Vows| ; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live .       Max teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing My Favorite Things but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with the Captain about the imminent  Anschluss , trying to convince him that it is inevitable . When he refuses to compromise on his opposition to it, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be An Ordinary Couple . As they marry, the nuns reprise Maria against the wedding processional.     While Maria and the Captain are on their honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzberg Festival. Herr Zeller, the  Gauleiter  of the region, demands to know why they are not flying the flag of the  |Third_Reich|Third_Reich|  now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of the Nazi German occupation, the Captain decides the children should not sing at the event. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married . Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the  |German_Navy|German_Navyhistory| , and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed  |Nazi|Nazi| . The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to  |Bremerhaven|Bremerhaven|  to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.     At the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of Do-Re-Mi , Max brings out the Captains guitar. Captain von Trapp sings  |Edelweiss|Edelweiss|  , as a goodbye to his homeland, while using  |Austrias_national_flower|Leontopodium_Alpinumnames|  as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp familys last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing So Long, Farewell , leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the  |Nazis|Nazis|  start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they arent there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the  |Alps|Alps|  as the nuns reprise Climb Evry Mountain .             ;Act I   Preludium  – Mother Abbess with Nuns    |The_Sound_of_Music|The_Sound_Of_Music|   – Maria    |Maria|Maria|   – Sister Berthe, Sister Sophia, Sister Margaretta, and the Mother Abbess    |My_Favorite_Things|My_Favorite_Things|   – Maria and the Mother Abbess   My Favorite Things  – Maria    |Do_Re_Mi|Do_Re_Mi|   – Maria and the children    |Sixteen_Going_on_Seventeen|Sixteen_Going_On_Seventeen|   – Rolf and Liesl    |The_Lonely_Goatherd|The_Lonely_Goatherd|   – Maria and the children   The Lonely Goatherd  – Gretl   How Can Love Survive  – Max and Elsa   The Sound of Music  – Maria, the Captain and the children    |Ländler|Ländler| |_So_Long_Farewell|So_Long_Farewell|   – The children   Morning Hymn  – Nuns    |Climb_Evry_Mountain|Climb_Evry_Mountain|   – Mother Abbess        ;Act II   My Favorite Things  – Maria and the children    |No_Way_to_Stop_It|No_Way_To_Stop_It|   – Elsa, Max and the Captain   An Ordinary Couple  – Maria and the Captain  †   Gaudeamus Domino  – Nuns   Maria  – Nuns   Confitemini Domino  – Nuns   Sixteen Going on Seventeen  – Maria and Liesl   Do-Re-Mi  – Maria, the Captain, and the children  ‡    |Edelweiss|Edelweiss|   – The Captain   So Long, Farewell  – Maria, the Captain, and the children   Finale Ultimo  – Nuns        ;Notes   The musical numbers listed appeared in the original production unless otherwise noted.  |Edelweiss|Edelweiss|  is a traditional Austrian song, it was written for the musical and did not become known in Austria until after the films success.
