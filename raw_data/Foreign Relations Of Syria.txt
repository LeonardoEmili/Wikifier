In December 2018, after American president  |Donald_Trump|Donald_Trump|  announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, some countries initiated reopening of their diplomatic relations with Syria. After the visit of Sudanese President, the Arab League initiated the process of readmission of Syria to the organization,  while  |United_Arab_Emirates|United_Arab_Emirates|  reopened their embassy in Syria on 27 December,  and Bahrain,  as well as reportedly Kuwait   and Italy  announced their intentions to reopen embassies as well.                        |Arab_nationalism|Arab_Nationalism|  is a fundamental doctrine of Syrian government policy, and as such it doesnt consider inhabitants of other Arab states as foreigners. Rather the Syrian Arab Republic is considered as part of one vast Arab homeland, al-watan al-arabi.     Syrias relations with the Arab world were strained by its support for  |Iran|Iran|  during the  |Iran–Iraq_War|Iran–Iraq_War| , which began in 1980. With the end of the war in August 1988, Syria began a slow process of reintegration with the other Arab states. In 1989, it joined with the rest of the Arab world in readmitting  |Egypt|Egypt|  to the 19th  |Arab_League|Arab_League|  Summit at  |Casablanca|Casablanca| .     This decision, prompted in part by Syrias need for Arab League support of its own position in Lebanon, marked the end of the Syrian-led opposition to Egypt and the 1977–79  |Sadat|Anwar_Sadat|  initiatives toward Israel, as well as the  |Camp_David_Accords|Camp_David_Accords| . It coincided with the end of the 10-year Arab subsidy to Syria and other front-line Arab countries pledged at  |Baghdad|Baghdad|  in 1978. Syria re-established full diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1989. In the 1990–1991  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| , Syria joined other Arab states in the US-led multinational coalition against Iraq. In 1998, Syria began a slow rapprochement with Iraq, driven primarily by economic needs. Syria continues to play an active pan-Arab role, which has intensified as the peace process collapsed in September 2000 with the start of the second Palestinian uprising  against Israel. Though it voted in favor of  |UNSCR_1441|Un_Security_Council_Resolution_1441|  in 2002, Syria was against coalition military action in Iraq in 2003. However, the Syrian government accepted  |UNSCR_1483|Un_Security_Council_Resolution_1483|  , which lifted sanctions on Iraq and established a framework to assist the Iraqi people in determining their political future and rebuilding their economy. Currently, much of the Middle East has condemned Syrias handling of the civil uprising, with only a few countries in the Middle East supporting Syria, most notably Iran, Iraq and Lebanon.
