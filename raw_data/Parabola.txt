     In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a parabola is a  |plane_curve|Plane_Curve|  which is  |mirror-symmetrical|Reflection_Symmetry|  and is approximately U  |shape|Shape| d. It fits several other superficially different  |mathematical|Mathematics|  descriptions, which can all be proved to define exactly the same curves.        One description of a parabola involves a  |point|Point|   and a  |line|Line|  . The focus does not lie on the directrix. The parabola is the  |locus_of_points|Locus|  in that plane that are  |equidistant|Equidistant|  from both the directrix and the focus. Another description of a parabola is as a  |conic_section|Conic_Section| , created from the intersection of a right circular  |conical_surface|Conical_Surface|  and a  |plane|Plane|  which is  |parallel|Parallel|  to another plane that is  |tangent|Tangent| ial to the conical surface.     The line perpendicular to the directrix and passing through the focus is called the  |axis_of_symmetry|Axis_Of_Symmetry|  . The point where the parabola intersects its axis of symmetry is called the  |vertex|Vertex|  , and is the point where the parabola is most sharply curved. The distance between the vertex and the focus, measured along the axis of symmetry, is the focal length . The  |latus_rectum|Conic_Sectionconic_Parameters|  is the  |chord|Chord|  of the parabola which is parallel to the directrix and passes through the focus. Parabolas can open up, down, left, right, or in some other arbitrary direction. Any parabola can be repositioned and rescaled to fit exactly on any other parabola—that is, all parabolas are geometrically  |similar|Similarity| .     Parabolas have the property that, if they are made of material that  |reflects|Reflection| |light|Light| , then light which travels parallel to the axis of symmetry of a parabola and strikes its concave side is reflected to its focus, regardless of where on the parabola the reflection occurs. Conversely, light that originates from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel  beam, leaving the parabola parallel to the axis of symmetry. The same effects occur with  |sound|Sound|  and other forms of energy. This reflective property is the basis of many practical uses of parabolas.     The parabola has many important applications, from a  |parabolic_antenna|Parabolic_Antenna|  or  |parabolic_microphone|Parabolic_Microphone|  to automobile headlight reflectors to the design of  |ballistic_missiles|Ballistic_Missiles| . They are frequently used in  |physics|Physics| ,  |engineering|Engineering| , and many other areas.             The earliest known work on conic sections was by  |Menaechmus|Menaechmus|  in the  |4th_century_BC|4Th_Century_Bc| . He discovered a way to solve the problem of  |doubling_the_cube|Doubling_The_Cube|  using parabolas.  The area enclosed by a parabola and a line segment, the so-called parabola segment , was computed by  |Archimedes|Archimedes|  via the  |method_of_exhaustion|Method_Of_Exhaustion|  in the  |3rd_century_BC|3Rd_Century_Bc| , in his  The Quadrature of the Parabola . The name parabola is due to  |Apollonius|Apollonius_Of_Perga|  who discovered many properties of conic sections. It means application , referring to application of areas concept, that has a connection with this curve, as Apollonius had proved.  The focus–directrix property of the parabola and other conic sections is due to  |Pappus|Pappus_Of_Alexandria| .      |Galileo|Galileo_Galilei|  showed that the path of a projectile follows a parabola, a consequence of uniform acceleration due to gravity.     The idea that a  |parabolic_reflector|Parabolic_Reflector|  could produce an image was already well known before the invention of the  |reflecting_telescope|Reflecting_Telescope| .     Designs were proposed in the early to mid seventeenth century by many  |mathematicians|Mathematician|  including  |René_Descartes|René_Descartes| ,  |Marin_Mersenne|Marin_Mersenne| , Stargazer, . and  |James_Gregory|James_Gregory| . Stargazer,  When  |Isaac_Newton|Isaac_Newton|  built the  |first_reflecting_telescope|Newtons_Reflector|  in 1668, he skipped using a parabolic mirror because of the difficulty of fabrication, opting for a  |spherical_mirror|Spherical_Mirror| . Parabolic mirrors are used in most modern reflecting telescopes and in satellite dishes and radar receivers.           A parabola can be defined geometrically as a set of points  in the Euclidean plane:     A parabola is a set of points, such that for any point P of the set the distance  PF  to a fixed point F , the focus, is equal to the distance  Pl  to a fixed line l , the directrixvertex and the line FV the axis of symmetry of the parabola.                  If one introduces cartesian coordinates, such that F  ,f /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  math 0 the parabola has a downwards opening.   The presumption that the axis is parallel to the y-axis allows one to consider a parabola as the graph of a  |polynomial|Polynomial|  of degree 2, and vice versa: the graph of an arbitrary polynomial of degree 2 is a parabola .   If one exchanges x and y , one obtains equations of the form y22px . These parabolas open to the left .       If the focus is F and the directrix ax+by+c0 one obtains the equation   :            For a  |parametric_equation|Parametric_Equation|  of a parabola in general position see .     The  |implicit_equation|Implicit_Equation|  of a parabola is defined by an  |irreducible_polynomial|Irreducible_Polynomial|  of degree two   : ax2+bxy+cy2 +dx+ey+f 0,   such that b2-4ac0, or, equivalently, such that ax2+bxy+cy2 is the square of a  |linear_polynomial|Linear_Polynomial| .          The previous section shows: any parabola with the origin as vertex and the y-axis as axis of symmetry can be considered as the graph of a function   : f a x2   a   0 .     For a /math math 0 opening to the bottom . From the section above one obtains:     The focus  is   ,   the focal length   , the semi-latus rectum is p  ,   the vertex is   ,   the directrix has the equation y-  ,   the  tangent  at point   has the equation y2ax0x-ax20 ,     For a1 the parabola is the unit parabola with equation yx2 .   Its focus is   , the semi-latus rectum p  and the directrix has the equation y-  .     The general function of degree 2 is   : f ax2 + bx + c   a,b,c     a   0 .    |Completing_the_square|Completing_The_Square|  yields   : f a  +   ,   which is the equation of a parabola with     the axis x-  ,   the focal length   , the semi-latus rectum p  ,   the vertex V  ,   the focus F   ,   the directrix y  ,   the point of the parabola intersecting the y-axis has coordinates   ,   the tangent at a point on the y-axis has the equation ybx+c .          Two objects in the Euclidean plane are  similar  if one can be transformed to the other by a similarity, that is, an arbitrary  |composition|Composition_Of_Functions|  of rigid motions  and  |uniform_scalings|Uniform_Scaling| .     A parabola   P with vertex V can be transformed by the translation   to one with the origin as vertex. A suitable rotation around the origin can then transform the parabola to one that has the -axis as axis of symmetry. Hence the parabola   P can be transformed by a rigid motion to a parabola with an equation yax2, a   0 . Such a parabola can then be transformed by the  |uniform_scaling|Uniform_Scaling|    into the unit parabola with equation yx2 . Thus, any parabola can be mapped to the unit parabola by a similarity.      A  |synthetic|Synthetic_Geometry|  approach, using similar triangles, can also be used to establish this result.      The general result is that two conic sections are similar if and only if they have the same eccentricity. Thus, only circles share this property with parabolas , while general ellipses and hyperbolas do not.     There are other simple affine transformations that map the parabola yax2 onto the unit parabola, such as     . But this mapping is not a similarity, and only shows that all parabolas are affinely equivalent .          The  |pencil|Pencil|  of  |conic_sections|Conic_Section|  with the x-axis as axis of symmetry, one vertex at the origin and the same semi-latus rectum p can be represented by the equation   : y2 2px + x2     e  0 ,   with e the  |eccentricity|Eccentricity| .   For e0 the conic is a circle ,   for 0  , the parabola with equation y22px has the  |polar_coordinate|Polar_Coordinate_System|  representation:     : r 2p               :     Its vertex is V and its focus is F  .     If one shifts the origin into the focus, i.e., F , one obtains the equation     : r     2  k.   Remark 1: Inverting this polar form shows: a parabola is the  |inverse|Inversive_Geometry|  of a  |cardioid|Cardioid| .     Remark 2: The second polar form is a special case of a pencil of conics with focus F :   : r  , .              The diagram represents a  |cone|Cone|  with its axis vertical. The point A is its  |apex|Apex| . An inclined  |cross-section|Cross_Section|  of the cone, shown in pink, is inclined from the vertical by the same angle, , as the side of the cone. According to the definition of a parabola as a conic section, the boundary of this pink cross-section, EPD, is a parabola.     A horizontal cross-section of the cone passes through the vertex, P, of the parabola. This cross-section is circular, but appears  |elliptical|Elliptical|  when viewed obliquely, as is shown in the diagram. Its centre is V, and  is a diameter. We will call its radius  .     Another horizontal, circular cross-section of the cone is farther from the apex, A, than the one just described. It has a  |chord|Chord|  , which joins the points where the parabola  |intersects|Intersection|  the circle. Another chord, , is the  |perpendicular_bisector|Perpendicular_Bisector|  of , and is consequently a diameter of the circle. These two chords and the parabolas axis of symmetry, , all intersect at the point  M.     All the labelled points, except D and E, are  |coplanar|Coplanar| . They are in the plane of symmetry of the whole figure. This includes the point F, which is not mentioned above. It is defined and discussed below, in the paragraph  |Position_of_the_focus|Position_Of_The_Focus|  .     Let us call the length of  and of  , and the length of   .       The lengths of  and  are:     :      :        Using the  |intersecting_chords_theorem|Chord_Theorem|  on the chords  and , we get:     :                 Substituting:     : 4ry      Rearranging:     : y      For any given cone and parabola,  and  are constants, but  and  are variables which depend on the arbitrary height at which the horizontal cross-section BECD is made. This last equation shows the relationship between these variables. They can be interpreted as  |Cartesian_coordinates|Cartesian_Coordinate_System|  of the points D and E, in a system in the pink plane with P as its origin. Since  is squared in the equation, the fact that D and E are on opposite sides of the -axis is unimportant. If the horizontal cross-section moves up or down, toward or away from the apex of the cone, D and E move along the parabola, always maintaining the relationship between  and  shown in the equation. The parabolic curve is therefore the  |locus|Locus|  of points where the equation is satisfied, which makes it a  |Cartesian_graph|Graph_Of_A_Function|  of the quadratic function in the equation.     This discussion started from the definition of a parabola as a conic section, but it has now led to a description as a graph of a quadratic function. This shows that these two descriptions are equivalent. They both define curves of exactly the same shape.       It is proved in a  |preceding_section|In_A_Cartesian_Coordinate_System|  that if a parabola has its vertex at the origin, and if it opens in the positive  direction, then its equation is , where  is its focal length. Comparing this with the last equation above shows that the focal length of the parabola in the cone is .       In the diagram above, the point  V is the  |foot_of_the_perpendicular|Perpendicularfoot_Of_A_Perpendicular|  from the vertex of the parabola to the axis of the cone. The point  F is the foot of the perpendicular from the point  V to the plane of the parabola. By symmetry, F is on the axis of symmetry of the parabola. Angle VPF is  |complementary|Complementary_Angles|  to , and angle PVF is complementary to angle VPF, therefore angle PVF is . Since the length of  is , the distance of F from the vertex of the parabola is . It is shown above that this distance equals the focal length of the parabola, which is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The focus and the point  F are therefore equally distant from the vertex, along the same line, which implies that they are the same point. Therefore, the point  F, defined above, is the focus of the parabola.       An alternative proof can be done using  |Dandelin_spheres|Dandelin_Spheres| . It works without calculation and uses elementary geometric considerations, only.           The reflective property states that, if a parabola can reflect light, then light which enters it travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry is reflected toward the focus. This is derived from the wave nature of light in the paragraph  |description_of_final_diagram|Description_Of_Final_Diagram|  , which describes a diagram just above it, at the end of this article. This derivation is valid, but may not be satisfying to readers who would prefer a mathematical approach. In the following proof, the fact that every point on the parabola is equidistant from the focus and from the directrix is taken as axiomatic.     Consider the parabola . Since all parabolas are similar, this simple case represents all others. The right-hand side of the diagram shows part of this parabola.       The point E is an arbitrary point on the parabola, with coordinates . The focus is F, the vertex is A , and the line   is the axis of symmetry. The line  is parallel to the axis of symmetry, and intersects the -axis at D. The point C is located on the directrix . The point B is the midpoint of the line segment .       Measured along the axis of symmetry, the vertex, A, is equidistant from the focus, F, and from the directrix. According to the  |Intercept_theorem|Intercept_Theorem| , since C is on the directrix, the -coordinates of F and C are equal in absolute value and opposite in sign. B is the midpoint of FC, so its -coordinate is zero, so it lies on the -axis. Its -coordinate is half that of E, D, and C, i.e., . The slope of the line  is the quotient of the lengths of  and , which is , which comes to . But  is also the slope of the parabola at E. Therefore, the line  is the tangent to the parabola at E.     The distances  and  are equal because E is on the parabola, F is the focus and C is on the directrix. Therefore, since B is the midpoint of , triangles △FEB and △CEB are congruent , which implies that the angles marked  are congruent. This means that a ray of light which enters the parabola and arrives at E travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry will be reflected by the line  so it travels along the line , as shown in red in the diagram . Since  is the tangent to the parabola at E, the same reflection will be done by an infinitesimal arc of the parabola at E. Therefore, light that enters the parabola and arrives at E travelling parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola is reflected by the parabola toward its focus.     The point E has no special characteristics. This conclusion about reflected light applies to all points on the parabola, as is shown on the left side of the diagram. This is the reflective property.       There are other theorems that can be deduced simply from the above argument.       The above proof and the accompanying diagram show that the tangent  bisects the angle ∠FEC. In other words, the tangent to the parabola at any point bisects the angle between the lines joining the point to the focus, and perpendicularly to the directrix.          Since triangles △FBE and △CBE are congruent,  is perpendicular to the tangent . Since B is on the -axis, which is the tangent to the parabola at its vertex, it follows that the point of intersection between any tangent to a parabola and the perpendicular from the focus to that tangent lies on the line that is tangential to the parabola at its vertex. See animated diagram  and  |pedal_curve|Pedal_Curve| .       If light travels along the line , it moves parallel to the axis of symmetry and strikes the convex side of the parabola at E. It is clear from the above diagram that this light will be reflected directly away from the focus, along an extension of the segment .             The above proofs of the reflective and tangent bisection properties use a line of calculus. For readers who are not comfortable with calculus, the following alternative is presented.     In this diagram, F is the focus of the parabola, and T and U lie on its directrix. P is an arbitrary point on the parabola.  is perpendicular to the directrix, and the line  bisects angle ∠FPT. Q is another point on the parabola, with  perpendicular to the directrix. We know that      and     . Clearly,          .
