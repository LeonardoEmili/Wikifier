   Bernardino Ochino was an Italian, who was raised a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholicism|  and later turned to  |Protestantism|Protestantism|  and became a  |Protestant_reformer|Protestant_Reformer| .       Bernardino Ochino was born in  |Siena|Siena| , the son of the barber Domenico Ochino, and at the age of 7 or 8, in around 1504, was entrusted to the order of  |Franciscan|Franciscan|  Friars. From 1510 he studied medicine at  |Perugia|Perugia| .          At the age of 38, Ochino transferred himself in 1534 to the newly founded  |Order_of_Friars_Minor_Capuchin|Order_Of_Friars_Minor_Capuchin| . By then he was the close friend of  |Juan_de_Valdés|Juan_De_Valdés| ,  |Pietro_Bembo|Pietro_Bembo| ,  |Vittoria_Colonna|Vittoria_Colonna| ,  |Pietro_Martire|Pietro_Martire_Vermigli| ,  |Carnesecchi|Pietro_Carnesecchi| . In 1538 he was elected vicar-general of his order. In 1539, urged by Bembo, he visited  |Venice|Venice|  and delivered a course of  |sermons|Sermon|  showing a sympathy with  |justification_by_faith|Justification_By_Faith| , which appeared more clearly in his Dialogues published the same year. He was suspected and denounced, but nothing ensued until the establishment of the  |Inquisition|Inquisition|  in  |Rome|Rome|  in June 1542, at the instigation of Cardinal  |Giovanni_Pietro_Carafa|Pope_Paul_Iv| . Ochino received a citation to  |Rome|Rome| , and set out to obey it about the middle of August. According to his own statement, he was deterred from presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of  |Cardinal_Contarini|Gasparo_Contarini| , whom he found at  |Bologna|Bologna| , dying of  |poison|Poison|  administered by the reactionary party.       Ochino turned aside to  |Florence|Florence,_Italy| , and after some hesitation went across the  |Alps|Alps|  to  |Geneva|Geneva| . He was cordially received by  |John_Calvin|John_Calvin| , and published within two years several volumes of Prediche, controversial tracts rationalizing his change of  |religion|Religion| . He also addressed replies to marchioness  |Vittoria_Colonna|Vittoria_Colonna| ,  |Claudio_Tolomei|Claudio_Tolomei| , and other Italian sympathizers who were reluctant to go to the same length as himself. His own breach with the  |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church|  was final.       In 1545 Ochino became minister of the Italian Protestant congregation at  |Augsburg|Augsburg| . From this time dates his contact with  |Caspar_Schwenckfeld|Caspar_Schwenckfeld| . He was compelled to flee when, in January 1547, the city was occupied by the imperial forces for the  |Diet_of_Augsburg|Diet_Of_Augsburg| .     Ochino found asylum in England, where he was made a  |prebendary|Prebendary|  of  |Canterbury_Cathedral|Canterbury_Cathedral| , received a  |pension|Pension|  from  |Edward_VIs|Edward_Vi_Of_England|  privy purse, and composed his major work, the Tragoedie or Dialoge of the unjuste usurped primacie of the Bishop of Rome. This text, originally written in  |Latin|Latin| , is extant only in the 1549 translation of Bishop  |John_Ponet|John_Ponet| . The form is a series of dialogues.  |Lucifer|Lucifer| , enraged at the spread of  |Jesuss|Jesus|  kingdom, convokes the fiends in council, and resolves to set up the  |pope|Pope|  as  |antichrist|Antichrist| . The state, represented by the emperor  |Phocas|Phocas| , is persuaded to connive at the popes assumption of spiritual authority; the other churches are intimidated into acquiescence; Lucifers projects seem fully accomplished, when  |Heaven|Heaven|  raises up  |Henry_VIII_of_England|Henry_Viii_Of_England|  and his son for their overthrow.     Several of Ochinos Prediche were translated into English by  |Anna_Cooke|Anne_Bacon| ; and he published numerous controversial treatises on the Continent. Ochino’s Che Cosa è Christo was translated into Latin and English by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1547. Mueller, Janel & Scodel, Joshua, eds, Elizabeth I: Translations, 1544-1589       In 1553 the accession of  |Mary_I|Mary_I_Of_England|  drove Ochino from England. He went to Basel, where  |Lelio_Sozzini|Lelio_Sozzini|  and the lawyer  |Martino_Muralto|Martino_Muralto|  were sent to secure Ochino as pastor of the Italian church at  |Zürich|Zürich| , which Ochino accepted. The Italian congregation there was composed mainly of refugees from  |Locarno|Locarno| . There for 10 years Ochino wrote books which gave increasing evidence of his alienation from the  |orthodoxy|Orthodoxy|  around him. The most important of these was the Labyrinth, a discussion of the  |freedom_of_the_will|Free_Will| , covertly undermining the  |Calvinistic|Calvinism|  doctrine of  |predestination|Predestination| .     In 1563 a long simmering storm burst on Ochino with the publication of his Thirty Dialogues, in one of which his adversaries maintained that he had justified  |polygamy|Polygamy|  under the disguise of a pretended refutation. His dialogues on  |divorce|Divorce|  and against the  |Trinity|Trinity|  were also considered heretical.       Ochino was not given opportunity to defend himself, and was banished from Zürich. After being refused admission by other Protestant cities, he directed his steps towards Poland, at that time the most tolerant state in Europe. He had not resided there long when an edict appeared banishing all foreign  |dissidents|Dissident| . Fleeing the country, he encountered the  |plague|Black_Death|  at  |Pińczów|Pińczów| ; three of his four children were carried off; and he himself, worn out by misfortune, died in solitude and obscurity at  |Slavkov|Slavkov_U_Brna|  in  |Moravia|Moravia| , about the end of 1564.       Ochinos reputation among Protestants was low. He was charged by  |Thomas_Browne|Thomas_Browne|  in 1643 Ce monstre dhomme, ce secrétaire de lenfer, en un mot, lauteur de labominable livre des trois imposteurs with the authorship of the legendary-apocryphal heretical treatise  De tribus Impostoribus , as well as with having carried his alleged approval of polygamy into practice.     His biographer  |Karl_Benrath|Karl_Benrath|  justified him, representing him as a fervent  |evangelist|Evangelism|  and at the same time as a speculative thinker with a passion for free inquiry. The picture is of Ochino always learning and unlearning and arguing out difficult questions with himself in his dialogues, frequently without attaining to any absolute conviction.
