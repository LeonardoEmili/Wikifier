            Afonso II , or Affonso , Alfonso or Alphonso  or Alphonsus , nicknamed the Fat ,  |King_of_Portugal|List_Of_Portuguese_Monarchs| , was born in  |Coimbra|Coimbra|  on 23 April 1185 and died on 25 March 1223 in the same city. He was the second but eldest surviving son of  |Sancho_I_of_Portugal|Sancho_I_Of_Portugal|  by his wife,  |Dulce|Dulce_Of_Aragon| ,  Infanta  of  |Aragon|Crown_Of_Aragon| . Afonso succeeded his father on 27 March 1211.          As a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather  |Afonso_I|Afonso_I_Of_Portugal|  were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring  |Kingdom_of_Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile|  or against the  |Moorish|Moors|  lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to ensure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like  |Alcácer_do_Sal|Alcácer_Do_Sal|  in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.     Since military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the states administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with  |private_property|Private_Property| , civil justice, and  |minting|Mint| . Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  and began amicable commercial relations with most of them.     Other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugals position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being  |excommunicated|Excommunicated|  for his audacities by  |Pope_Honorius_III|Pope_Honorius_Iii| , Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in Coimbra on 25 March 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so.           King Afonso was buried originally at the  |Monastery_of_Santa_Cruz|Monastery_Of_Santa_Cruz|  in Coimbra where his body remained for nearly ten years. His remains were transferred subsequently to  |Alcobaça_Monastery|Alcobaça_Monastery| , as he had stipulated in his will. He and his wife, Queen Urraca, were buried at its Royal Pantheon.               In 1206, he married his fourth cousin Infanta  |Urraca_of_Castile|Urraca_Of_Castile,_Queen_Of_Portugal| , daughter of  |Alfonso_VIII_of_Castile|Alfonso_Viii_Of_Castile|  and  |Eleanor_of_England|Eleanor_Of_England,_Queen_Of_Castile| , both being descendants of King  |Alfonso_VI_of_León|Alfonso_Vi_Of_León| . The offspring of this marriage were:      |Infante_Sancho|Sancho_Ii_Of_Portugal|  , succeeded his father as Sancho II, 4th  |King_of_Portugal|King_Of_Portugal| ;  |Infante_Afonso|Afonso_Iii_Of_Portugal|  , succeeded his brother Sancho as Afonso III, 5th  |King_of_Portugal|King_Of_Portugal| ;  |Infanta_Leonor|Leonor_Of_Portugal,_Queen_Of_Denmark|  . Married  |Valdemar_the_Young|Valdemar_The_Young| , son of  |Valdemar_II_of_Denmark|Valdemar_Ii_Of_Denmark|  and Margaret of Bohemia, daughter of  |Ottokar_I_of_Bohemia|Ottokar_I_Of_Bohemia| ;    |Infante_Fernando|Fernando,_Lord_Of_Serpa|  , Lord of  |Serpa|Serpa|  and married to Sancha Fernández de Lara with whom he had no issue. He was the father of an illegitimate son, Sancho Fernandes, prior of Santo Estêvão of Alfama.     Out of wedlock, he had two illegitimate sons:   João Afonso , buried in the Alcobaça monastery;  |Faro|Faro,_Portugal|  in 1249. He had an illegitimate daughter named Constança Peres.
