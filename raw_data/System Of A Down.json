They formed a band named Soil with Tankian on vocals and keyboards, Malakian on vocals and guitar, Dave Hakopyan  on bass and Domingo Dingo Laranio on drums. The band hired Shavo Odadjian as manager, although he eventually joined Soil as rhythm guitarist. In 1994, after only one live show at the Roxy and one jam session recording, Hakopyan and Laranio left the band.       After Soil split up, Tankian, Odadjian, and Malakian formed a new band, System of a Down. The group took its name from a poem that Malakian had written titled Victims of a Down .

On September 3, 2001, System of a Down had planned on launching their second album at a free concert in Hollywood as a thank you to fans. The concert, which was to be held in a parking lot, was set up to accommodate 3,500 people; however, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 fans showed up. Because of the large excess number of fans, the performance was cancelled by police officers just before the group took the stage. No announcement was made that the concert had been cancelled. Fans waited for more than an hour for the group to appear, but when a banner hanging at the back of the stage that read System of a Down was removed by security, the audience rushed the stage, destroying all the bands touring gear and began to riot, throwing rocks at police, breaking windows, and knocking over portable toilets. The riot lasted six hours, during which six arrests were made. The bands manager, David Beno Benveniste, later said that the riot could have been avoided if the group had been permitted to perform or had they been allowed to make a statement at the concert regarding the cancellation. System of a Downs scheduled in-store performance the next day was cancelled to prevent a similar riot.

In a November 2016 interview with  Kerrang! , drummer John Dolmayan revealed that System of a Down was working on more than a dozen songs for their follow-up to the  Mezmerize  and  Hypnotize  albums. Although he stated that the band does not know when the album will be released, he added that, I want everyone on board and feeling good about it. Thats what were trying to accomplish right now. Theres a tremendous amount of pressure on us, though, because its been 11 years—at least 12 by the time it comes out.      In a video Q & A session with fans on July 2, 2017, Shavo Odadjian was asked about the status of the next album, and he responded, Im waiting for a new album too. Its not happening. I dont know.

        ", Serj Tankian said that System of a Down wrote some new material but was uncertain of what to do with it. He then said that he doesnt want to commit to a new album due to the lack of committing to longform touring.      In an April 2018 interview, Daron Malakian said that the band did not abandon the idea of making new material,  and made a passing mention that System of a Down is not making any music at the moment.  Dolmayan said that he is ready to start work on the next album, but that certain members of my band haven’t been able to make it work for themselves , expressing uncertainty on if it would ever be made.      Malakian singled Tankian out as the reason no new album had yet been released.  Tankian detailed his view of the bands past and present conflicts and their overall situation, saying we couldn’t see eye to eye on all these points we decided to put aside the idea of a record altogether for the time being.  Dolmayan blamed all of the members due to the personal and creative differences that have been preventing them from recording a new studio album.  Tankian also expressed uncertainty on if the new album would be made or not, but did not rule out the possibility. He then described on how the sound would be, Its gotta be organic, its gotta feel right in every way.      Odadjian said that the band has material written from like the last 10, 12 years , but is uncertain on if it would form into a System of a Down album or not. He also said that Malakian and Tankian have visual differences on what the album should sound like, and that the bands inner tension have been building far longer than fans would be aware of, despite having love and respect for one another nonetheless.  He would later say that there is no conflict between the members, expressing confidence that System of a Down would eventually record a new album, and claims that they have material written which would be their best to date.  However, Tankian stated that there was no talk of the band recording a new album.       Malakian explained that there is a mixture between the matter of different creative perspectives for the bands hesitation to record a new studio album and the lack of desire to tour; however he did not dismiss the possibility of an album being made, but that it would likely not happen anytime soon.  He feels that the fans dont care that the band isnt making an album, but I think a lot of the fans just want an album. He expressed hopes that the members would get together and record new music, but is content with the direction of his band Scars on Broadway, noting about the members good friendship, But at the same time, I dont see that happening anytime soon that were all going to get together and make a new System of a Down album.  Malakian said that Tankian and the rest of the band members have been unable to come to an agreement over how to go about making new music, but insists that there is no negativity between them.      Despite System of a Downs ability to perform live, Odadjian expressed disappointment in their inability to record new music, explaining that there have been material written from the other members in the form of a possible new album, but without Tankians presence and no recordings made. He questioned why the band still hasnt made an album, citing creative differences as the problem.            System of a Downs lyrics are often oblique  or ": null
