                The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria  is an  |Oriental_Orthodox|Oriental_Orthodoxy| |Christian|Christianity| |church|Christian_Denomination|  based in  |Egypt|Egypt| ,  |Africa|Africa|  and the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| . The head of the Church and the  |See|Apostolic_See|  of  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  is the  |Patriarch_of_Alexandria_on_the_Holy_See_of_Saint_Mark|Pope_Of_The_Coptic_Orthodox_Church_Of_Alexandria| , who also carries the title of Coptic Pope. The See of Alexandria is titular, and today the Coptic Pope presides from  |Saint_Marks_Coptic_Orthodox_Cathedral|Saint_Marks_Coptic_Orthodox_Cathedral|  in the  |Abbassia|Abbassia|  District in  |Cairo|Cairo| . The church follows the  |Alexandrian_Rite|Alexandrian_Rite|  for its liturgy, prayer and devotional patrimony. With 18–22 million members worldwide, whereof about 15 to 20 million are in Egypt,  it is the countrys largest Christian church.     According to its tradition, the Coptic Church was established by  |Saint_Mark|St._Mark_The_Evangelist| , an  |apostle|Apostles|  and  |evangelist|Four_Evangelists| , during the middle of the 1st century .  |Eusebius_of_Caesarea|Eusebius_Of_Caesarea| , the author of  Ecclesiastical History  in the 4th century, states that Saint Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. AD  41 or 43  Due to disputes concerning the  |nature_of_Christ|Hypostatic_Union| , it split from the rest of the Christendom after the  |Council_of_Chalcedon|Council_Of_Chalcedon|  in AD  451, resulting in a rivalry with the  |Byzantine_Orthodox_Church|Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchate_Of_Alexandria_And_All_Africa| . In the 4–7th centuries the Coptic Church gradually expanded due to the  |Christianization|Christianization|  of the  |Aksumite_empire|Aksumite_Kingdom|  and of two of the three  |Nubian|Nubians|  kingdoms,  |Nobatia|Nobatia|  and  |Alodia|Alodia| , while the third Nubian kingdom,  |Makuria|Makuria| , recognized the Coptic patriarch after initially being aligned to the Byzantine Orthodox Church.     After AD  639 Egypt was ruled by its  |Islam|Islam| ic conquerors from  |Arabia|Arabia| , and the treatment of the Coptic Christians ranged from tolerance to open persecution. In the 12th century, the church relocated its seat from Alexandria to Cairo. The same century also saw the Copts become a religious minority. During the 14th and 15th centuries, Nubian Christianity was supplanted by Islam.     In 1959, the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  was granted  |autocephaly|Autocephaly|  or independence. This was extended to the  |Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  in 1998 following the successful  |Eritrean_War_of_Independence|Eritrean_War_Of_Independence|  from  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| .     Since the  |Arab_Spring_in_2011|Egyptian_Revolution_Of_2011| , the Copts have been suffering increased religious discrimination and violence.                    The Egyptian Church is traditionally believed to be founded by St Mark at around AD  42, and regards itself as the subject of many  |prophecies|Prophecies|  in the  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament| .  |Isaiah|Isaiah|  the prophet, in Chapter 19, Verse 19 says In that day there will be an altar to the  in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the  at its border . The first Christians in Egypt were common people who spoke Egyptian  |Coptic|Coptic_Language| .  There were also Alexandrian  |Jewish|Jewish|  people such as  |Theophilus|Theophilus| , whom  |Saint_Luke_the_Evangelist|Luke_The_Evangelist|  addresses in the introductory chapter of his  |gospel|Gospel_Of_Luke| . When the church was founded by  |Saint_Mark|Saint_Mark|  during the reign of the  |Roman|Roman_Empire| |emperor|Emperor| |Nero|Nero| , a great multitude of native Egyptians  embraced the Christian faith.      Christianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century of  |Saint_Marks|Saint_Mark|  arrival in Alexandria, as is clear from the  |New_Testament|New_Testament|  writings found in  |Bahnasa|Oxyrhynchus| , in Middle Egypt, which date around the year AD  200, and a fragment of the  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John| , written in Coptic, which was found in  |Upper_Egypt|Upper_Egypt|  and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local languages, namely Coptic.       The Coptic language is a universal language used in Coptic churches in every country. It is derived from ancient Egyptian and uses Greek letters. Many of the hymns in the liturgy are in Coptic and have been passed down for several thousand years. The language is used to preserve Egypts original language, which was banned by the Arab invaders, who ordered Arabic to be used instead.  Some examples of these hymns are ,, , and many more.           The  |Catechetical_School_of_Alexandria|Catechetical_School_Of_Alexandria|  is the oldest catechetical school in the world. St.  |Jerome|Jerome|  records that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by Saint Mark himself.  Around AD  190, under the leadership of the scholar  |Pantanaeus|Pantanaeus| , the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as  |Athenagoras|Athenagoras_Of_Athens| ,  |Clement|Clement_Of_Alexandria| ,  |Didymus|Didymus_The_Blind| , and the native Egyptian  |Origen|Origen| , who was considered the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies.     Many scholars such as Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars. The scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects; science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before  |Braille|Braille| , wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write.     The Theological college of the catechetical school was re-established in 1893. The new school currently has campuses in Ireland, Cairo,  |New_Jersey|New_Jersey| , and Los Angeles, where Coptic priests-to-be and other qualified men and women are taught among other subjects Christian theology, history, the Coptic language and art – including chanting, music,  |iconography|Iconography| , and tapestry.          Many Egyptian Christians went to the desert during the 3rd century, and remained there to pray and work and dedicate their lives to seclusion and worship of God. This was the beginning of the  |monastic_movement|Monasticism| , which was organized by  |Anthony_the_Great|Saint_Anthony_The_Great| , Saint  |Paul_of_Thebes|Paul_Of_Thebes| , the worlds first  |anchorite|Anchorite| ,  |Saint_Macarius_the_Great|Macarius_The_Great|  and  |Saint_Pachomius_the_Cenobite|Pachomius|  in the 4th century.      |Christian_monasticism|Christian_Monasticism|  was born in Egypt and was instrumental in the formation of the Coptic Orthodox Church character of submission, simplicity and humility, thanks to the teachings and writings of the  |Great_Fathers_of_Egypts_Deserts|Desert_Fathers| . By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. A great number of these monasteries are still flourishing and have new vocations to this day.     All Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example:  |Saint_Basil_the_Great|Basil_Of_Caesarea|  Archbishop of Caesarea of Cappadocia, founder and organizer of the monastic movement in Asia Minor, visited Egypt around AD  357 and his rule is followed by the Eastern Orthodox Churches; Saint Jerome who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt, while en route to  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem| , around AD  400 and left details of his experiences in his letters;  |Benedict|Benedict_Of_Nursia|  founded the Benedictine Order in the 6th century on the model of Saint Pachomius, but in a stricter form. Countless pilgrims have visited the Desert Fathers to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives.                In the 4th century, an Alexandrian  |presbyter|Presbyter|  named  |Arius|Arius|  began a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world and is now known as  |Arianism|Arianism| . The  |Ecumenical_Council_of_Nicea|First_Council_Of_Nicaea|  AD  325 was convened by  |Constantine|Constantine_I|  after the Pope  |Alexander_I_of_Alexandria|Pope_Alexander_I_Of_Alexandria|  requested to hold a Council to respond to heresies,  under the presidency of Saint  |Hosius_of_Cordova|Hosius_Of_Cordova|  to resolve the dispute. This eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as the  |Nicene_Creed|Nicene_Creed| .  The Creed, which is now recited throughout the Christian world, was based largely on the teaching put forth by a man who eventually would become Pope Saint  |Athanasius_of_Alexandria|Athanasius_Of_Alexandria| , the chief opponent of Arius.            In the year AD  381, Pope  |Timothy_I_of_Alexandria|Timothy_I_Of_Alexandria|  presided over the second ecumenical council known as the Ecumenical  |Council_of_Constantinople|First_Council_Of_Constantinople| , to judge Macedonius, who denied the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. This council completed the  |Nicene_Creed|Nicene_Creed|  with this confirmation of the divinity of the  |Holy_Spirit|Holy_Spirit|         Another theological dispute in the 5th century occurred over the teachings of  |Nestorius|Nestorius| , the Patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Word was not  |hypostatically|Hypostasis|  joined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title Mother of God  to the  |Virgin_Mary|Mary,_The_Mother_Of_Jesus| , declaring her instead to be Mother of Christ  Christotokos .     When reports of this reached the Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark, Pope Saint  |Cyril_I_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria|  acted quickly to correct this breach with orthodoxy, requesting that Nestorius repent. When he would not, the Synod of Alexandria met in an emergency session and a unanimous agreement was reached. Pope  |Cyril_I_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria| , supported by the entire See, sent a letter to Nestorius known as The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius. This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril. In these  |anathemas|Anathema| , Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, Anyone who dares to deny the Holy Virgin the title  Theotokos  is Anathema! Nestorius however, still would not repent and so this led to the convening of the  |First_Ecumenical_Council_of_Ephesus|First_Ecumenical_Council_Of_Ephesus|  , over which Cyril presided.     The Council confirmed the teachings of  |Saint_Athanasius|Athanasius_Of_Alexandria|  and confirmed the title of Mary as  |Mother_of_God|Mother_Of_God|  . It also clearly stated that anyone who separated Christ into two hypostases was anathema, as Cyril had said that there is One Nature for God the Word Incarnate . Also, the introduction to the creed was formulated as follows:     We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God  for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firmness of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen. not dissimilar to the  |Axion_Estin|Axion_Estin|  Chant still used in Orthodoxy               When in AD  451 Emperor  |Marcian|Marcian|  attempted to heal divisions in the Church, the response of  |Pope_Dioscorus|Dioscorus_Of_Alexandria|  – the Pope of Alexandria who was later exiled – was that the emperor should not intervene in the affairs of the Church. It was at  |Chalcedon|Chalcedon|  that the emperor, through the Imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response to his boldness. In AD  449, Pope Dioscorus headed the 2nd Council of Ephesus, called the  |Robber_Council|Robber_Council|  by Chalcedonian historians. It held to the  |Miaphysite|Miaphysite|  formula which upheld the Christology of One Incarnate Nature of God the Word ,  and upheld the heretic  |Eutyches|Eutyches|  claiming he was  |orthodox|Orthodoxy| .     The  |Council_of_Chalcedon|Council_Of_Chalcedon|  summoned Dioscorus three times to appear at the council, after which he was deposed. The Council of Chalcedon further deposed him for his support of Eutyches, but not necessarily for Eutychian  |Monophysitism|Monophysitism| . Dioscorus appealed to the conciliar fathers to allow for a more  |Miaphysite|Miaphysitism|  interpretation of Christology at the council, but was denied. Following his being deposed, the Coptic Church and its faithful felt unfairly underrepresented at the council and oppressed politically by the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| . After the Byzantines appointed  |Proterius_of_Alexandria|Proterius_Of_Alexandria|  as Patriarch to represent the  |Chalcedonian_Church|Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchate_Of_Alexandria_And_All_Africa| , the Coptic Church appointed their own Patriarch  |Timothy_Aelurus|Timothy_Aelurus|  and broke from the  |Chalcedonian_communion|Chalcedonian_Christianity| .     The  |Council_of_Chalcedon|Council_Of_Chalcedon| , from the perspective of the Alexandrine Christology, has deviated from the approved Cyrillian terminology and declared that Christ was one hypostasis in two natures. However, in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary, thus the foundation of the definition according to the  |Non-Chalcedonian|Non-Chalcedonianism|  adherents, according to the Christology of Cyril of Alexandria is valid. There is a change in the Non-Chalcedonian definition here, as the Nicene creed clearly uses the terms of , rather than in.     In terms of Christology, the Oriental Orthodox understanding is that Christ is One Nature—the Logos Incarnate, of the full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians understanding is that Christ is recognized in two natures, full humanity and full divinity.  |Oriental_Orthodoxy|Oriental_Orthodoxy|  contends that such a formulation is no different from what the  |Nestorians|Nestorianism|  teach.  This is the doctrinal perception that makes the apparent difference which separated the Oriental Orthodox from the Eastern Orthodox.     The Councils findings were rejected by many of the Christians on the fringes of the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| , including Egyptians,  |Syriacs|Syriac_Orthodox_Church| ,  |Armenians|Armenian_Apostolic_Church| , and others.     From that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the non-Chalcedonian native Egyptian one, now known as the  |Coptic_Pope_of_Alexandria_and_Patriarch_of_All_Africa_on_the_Holy_Apostolic_See_of_St._Mark|List_Of_Coptic_Orthodox_Popes_Of_Alexandria| , and the  |Melkite|Melkite|  or Imperial Patriarch, now known as the  |Greek_Orthodox_Patriarch_of_Alexandria|List_Of_Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchs_Of_Alexandria| . .     Almost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the native Egyptian Church .  See drop-down essay on Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire Those who supported the Chalcedonian definition remained in  |communion|Full_Communion|  with the other leading imperial churches of  |Rome|History_Of_The_Roman_Catholic_Church|  and  |Constantinople|Ecumenical_Patriarch_Of_Constantinople| . The non-Chalcedonian party became what is today called the  |Oriental_Orthodox_Church|Oriental_Orthodoxy| .     The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria regards itself as having been misunderstood at the Council of Chalcedon. There was an opinion in the Church that viewed that perhaps the Council understood the Church of Alexandria correctly, but wanted to curtail the existing power of the Alexandrine Hierarch, especially after the events that happened several years before at Constantinople from  |Pope_Theophilus_of_Alexandria|Pope_Theophilus_Of_Alexandria|  towards Patriarch  |John_Chrysostom|John_Chrysostom|  and the unfortunate turnouts of the Second Council of Ephesus in AD  449, where Eutychus misled Pope Dioscorus and the Council in confessing the Orthodox Faith in writing and then renouncing it after the Council, which in turn, had upset Rome, especially that the Tome which was sent was not read during the Council sessions.     To make things even worse, the Tome of Pope Leo of Rome was, according to the Alexandria School of Theology, particularly in regards to the definition of Christology, considered influenced by Nestorian heretical teachings. So, due to the above-mentioned, especially in the consecutive sequences of events, the Hierarchs of Alexandria were considered holding too much of power from one hand, and on the other hand, due to the conflict of the Schools of Theology, there would be an impasse and a scapegoat, i.e. Pope Dioscorus. The Tome of Leo has been widely criticized in the past 50 years as a much less than perfect orthodox theological doctrine.     It is also to be noted that by anathematizing Pope Leo because of the tone and content of his tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Dioscorus was found guilty of doing so without due process; in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at the  |Second_Council_of_Ephesus|Second_Council_Of_Ephesus|  in AD  449. Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as heretic by the councils canons.     Copts also believe that the Pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates. Romanides, John S. .     Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians  |Monophysites|Monophysitism|  , though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards Monophysitism as a heresy. The Chalcedonian doctrine in turn came to be known as  |Dyophysite|Dyophysitism|  .     A term that comes closer to Coptic Orthodoxy is  |Miaphysite|Miaphysitism| , which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria believes that Christ is perfect in His divinity, and He is perfect in His humanity, but His divinity and His humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word , which was reiterated by  |Saint_Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria| .     Copts, thus, believe in two natures human and divine that are united in one hypostasis without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration . These two natures did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye .       Prior to Chalcedon, the Imperial Churchs main division stemmed from  |Nestorianism|Nestorianism| , eventually leading the  |Church_of_the_East|Church_Of_The_East|  to declare its independence in AD  424. After the Council of Chalcedon in AD  451, the Coptic Church and its hierarchy felt suspicious of what they believed were  |Nestorian|Nestorianism|  elements within the  |Chalcedonian_Church|Chalcedonian_Christianity| . As a result, the anti-Chalcedon partisan,  |Timotheos_Aelurus|Pope_Timothy_Ii_Of_Alexandria| , consigned himself to depose the  |Chalcedonian_Pope_of_Alexandria|List_Of_Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchs_Of_Alexandria| ,  |Proterius_of_Alexandria|Proterius_Of_Alexandria| , and to set himself up as the  |Pope_of_Alexandria|Pope_Of_The_Coptic_Orthodox_Church_Of_Alexandria|  in opposition to the Chalcedonian Church. Copts suffered under the rule of the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire| . The  |Melkite|Melkite|  Patriarchs, appointed by the emperors as both spiritual leaders and civil governors, massacred those Egyptians they considered heretics. Many were tortured and martyred in attempts to force their acceptance of the Chalcedonian terms, but the Egyptians remained loyal to the Cyrillian  |Miaphysitism|Miaphysitism| . One of the most renowned Egyptian saints of the period is  |Saint_Samuel_the_Confessor|Saint_Samuel_The_Confessor| .          The  |Muslim_invasion_of_Egypt|Muslim_Invasion_Of_Egypt|  took place in AD  639. Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian population remained mainly Christian. However, gradual conversions to  |Islam|Islam|  over the centuries had changed Egypt from a Christian to a largely Muslim country by the end of the 12th century. Kamil, Jill . Coptic Egypt: History and Guide. Cairo: American University in Cairo. Another scholar writes that a combination of repression of Coptic revolts , Arab-Muslim immigration, and Coptic conversion to Islam resulted in the demographic decline of the Copts.  Egypts Umayyad rulers taxed Christians at a higher rate than Muslims, driving merchants towards Islam and undermining the economic base of the Coptic Church. Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchange in Pre-Modern Times , 93. Although the Coptic Church did not disappear, the Umayyad tax policies made it difficult for the church to retain the Egyptian elites. Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Encounters and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times , 93.       The Church suffered greatly under the many regimes of Islamic rule. Sometime during the 2nd millennium AD, the leadership of the Church, including the Pope, moved from Alexandria to Cairo. In 1798, the French invade Egypt unsuccessfully and the British help the Turks regain power over Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty.        The position of Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of the  |Muhammad_Ali_Dynasty|Muhammad_Ali_Dynasty| . The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit. In 1855 the  |jizya|Jizya|  tax was abolished by Said Pasha.  Shortly thereafter, the Copts started to serve in the Egyptian army.       Towards the end of the 19th century, the Coptic Church underwent phases of new development. In 1853, Pope Cyril IV established the first modern Coptic schools, including the first Egyptian school for girls. He also founded a printing press, which was only the second national press in the country. The Pope established very friendly relations with other denominations, to the extent that when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself from the country for a long period of time, he left his Church under the guidance of the Coptic Patriarch.     The Theological College of the School of Alexandria was reestablished in 1893. It began its new history with five students, one of whom was later to become its dean. Today it has campuses in Alexandria and Cairo, and in various dioceses throughout Egypt, as well as outside Egypt. It has campuses in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne, and London, where potential clergymen and other qualified men and women study many subjects, including theology, church history, missionary studies, and the Coptic language.               In 1959, the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  was granted its first own Patriarch by  |Pope_Cyril_VI|Pope_Cyril_Vi_Of_Alexandria| . Furthermore, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church similarly became independent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in 1994, when four bishops were consecrated by  |Pope_Shenouda_III_of_Alexandria|Pope_Shenouda_Iii_Of_Alexandria|  to form the basis of a local Holy Synod of the Eritrean Church. In 1998, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church gained its  |autocephaly|Autocephaly|  from the Coptic Orthodox Church when its first Patriarch was enthroned by  |Pope_Shenouda_III_of_Alexandria|Pope_Shenouda_Iii_Of_Alexandria| .     These three churches remain in  |full_communion|Full_Communion|  with each other and with the other  |Oriental_Orthodox|Oriental_Orthodox|  churches. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church do acknowledge the Honorary Supremacy of the  |Coptic_Orthodox_Patriarch_of_Alexandria|Coptic_Orthodox_Patriarch_Of_Alexandria| , since the  |Church_of_Alexandria|Church_Of_Alexandria|  is technically their Mother Church. Upon their selection, both Patriarchs must receive the approval and communion from the Holy Synod of the  |Apostolic_See_of_Alexandria|Church_Of_Alexandria|  before their enthronement.     Since the 1980s theologians from the Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox churches have been meeting in a bid to resolve theological differences, and have concluded that many of the differences are caused by the two groups using different terminology to describe the same thing .     In the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria agreed to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each others churches, making re-baptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other.  Previously, if a Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox wanted to get married, the marriage had to be performed twice, once in each church, for it to be recognized by both. Now it can be done in only one church and be recognized by both.     According to Christian Tradition and Canon Law, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria only ordains men to the priesthood and episcopate, and if they wish to be married, they must be married before they are ordained. In this respect they follow the same practices as all other  |Oriental_Orthodox_Churches|Oriental_Orthodox_Churches| , as well as all of  |Eastern_Orthodox_Churches|Eastern_Orthodox_Churches| .     Traditionally, the  |Coptic_language|Coptic_Language|  was used in church services, and the scriptures were written in the  |Coptic_alphabet|Coptic_Alphabet| . However, due to the Arabisation of Egypt, service in churches started to witness increased use of Arabic, while preaching is done entirely in Arabic. Native languages are used, in conjunction with Coptic, during services outside Egypt.     The liturgical calendar of the Coptic Orthodox Church is the  |Coptic_calendar|Coptic_Calendar|  . This calendar is based on the  |Egyptian_calendar|Egyptian_Calendar|  of  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| . Coptic Orthodox Christians celebrate  |Christmas|Christmas|  on 29 Koiak, which corresponds to 7 January in the  |Gregorian_Calendar|Gregorian_Calendar|  and 25 December in the  |Julian_Calendar|Julian_Calendar| . Coptic Christmas was adopted as an official national holiday in  |Egypt|Egypt|  in 2002.     In  |Tahrir_Square|Tahrir_Square| , Cairo, on Wednesday 2 February 2011, Coptic Christians joined hands to provide a protective cordon around their Muslim neighbors during  |salat|Salat|  in the midst of the  |2011_Egyptian_Revolution|2011_Egyptian_Revolution| . , Nevine Zaki, 3 February 2011, accessed 9 February 2011     On 17 March 2012, the  |Coptic_Orthodox_Pope|Coptic_Orthodox_Pope| ,  |Pope_Shenouda_III|Pope_Shenouda_Iii|  died, leaving many Copts mourning and worrying as tensions rose with  |Muslims|Muslims| . Pope Shenouda III constantly met with Muslim leaders in order to create peace. Many were worried about Muslims controlling  |Egypt|Egypt|  as the  |Muslim_Brotherhood|Muslim_Brotherhood|  won 70% of the parliamentary elections.       On 4 November 2012, Bishop Tawadros was chosen as the 118th Pope. In a ritual filled with prayer, chants and incense at  |Abbasiya|Abbassia|  cathedral in Cairo, the 60-year-old bishops name was picked by a blindfolded child from a glass bowl in which the names of two other candidates had also been placed. The enthronement was scheduled on 18 November 2012.            There are about 30 million Coptic Orthodox Christians in the world.  Between 23 and 25 million of them are found in Egypt under the jurisdiction of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.     Since Egypt does not have an official government census on religion, estimates of the size of Egypts Christian population vary from the estimated low previous government figures of 6 to 7 million to the 12 million reported by some Christian leaders in 2008. The actual numbers may be in the 23 to 25 million range, out of an Egyptian population of more than 90 million.      However, in 2011, the  |Pew_Research_Center|Pew_Research_Center|  announced that Copts in Egypt constitute 4.5% of the population, while the Catholic  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  puts Copts at 6 to 8%. Then in 2017 government owned news  |Al_Ahram|Al_Ahram|  estimated the percentage of Copts at 10 to 15%.  However, in 2012 after the Egyptian revolution the Muslim Brotherhood was drafting new constitution then Major-General Abu Bakr al-Guindi claimed that the lower figures support a downward trend in the percentage of Copts in Egypt, as recorded in consecutive estimated Egyptian censuses since a 1927 high where Egyptian Christians formed 8.3% of the population.  This decline has been explained by Major-General  |Abu_Bakr_al-Guindi|Abu_Bakr_Al-Guindi| , head of Egypts Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, as being the result of Copts having the highest emigration rate, the lowest birthrate and the highest income level in the country. However, this statement and population count has been rejected by the Coptic Church.      There are also significant numbers in the diaspora outside Africa in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany. The number of Coptic Orthodox Christians in the diaspora is roughly 2 to 5 million.      In addition, there are between 350,000 and 400,000 native African adherents in East, Central and South Africa, most in Sudan, whose population is less than 200,000.   Although under the jurisdiction of the Coptic Orthodox Church, these adherents are not considered Copts, since they are not ethnic Egyptians.     Some accounts regard members of the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  ,   World Council of Churches – News Release. 21 September 2005. Retrieved 25 November 2006. the  |Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  , as members of the Coptic Orthodox Church. This is however a misnomer, since both the Ethiopian and the Eritrean Churches, although daughter churches of the Church of Alexandria, are currently  |autocephalous|Autocephaly|  churches.          While Copts have cited instances of persecution throughout their history,  |Human_Rights_Watch|Human_Rights_Watch|  has noted growing religious intolerance and sectarian violence against Coptic Christians in recent years, and a failure by the Egyptian government to effectively investigate properly and prosecute those responsible. , hrw.org, January 24, 2010  Over a hundred Egyptian copts have been killed in sectarian clashes from 2011 to 2017, and many homes and businesses destroyed. In just one province , 77 cases of sectarian attacks on Copts between 2011 and 2016 have been documented by the  |Egyptian_Initiative_for_Personal_Rights|Egyptian_Initiative_For_Personal_Rights| .  The abduction and disappearance of Coptic Christian women and girls also remains a serious ongoing problem.            Besides Egypt, the Church of Alexandria has jurisdiction over all of  |Africa|Africa| .     In addition, the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  and  |Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  are daughter churches of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Both the Patriarchate of  |Addis_Ababa|Addis_Ababa|  and all Ethiopia and the Patriarchate of  |Asmara|Asmara|  and all  |Eritrea|Eritrea|  acknowledge the supremacy of honor and dignity of the  |Pope_of_Alexandria|Pope_Of_The_Coptic_Orthodox_Church_Of_Alexandria|  on the basis that both patriarchates were established by the Throne of Alexandria and that they have their roots in the Apostolic Church of Alexandria, and acknowledge that Saint Mark the Apostle is the founder of their Churches through the heritage and Apostolic evangelization of the Fathers of Alexandria.          Ethiopia received Christianity next to Jerusalem, through Jesuss own apostle, only a year after Jesus was crucified . Christianity became a national religion of Ethiopia, under the dominion of the Church of Alexandria, in the 4th century. The first bishop of Ethiopia,  |Saint_Frumentius|Frumentius| , was consecrated as  |Bishop_of_Axum|List_Of_Abunas_Of_Ethiopia|  by  |Pope_Athanasius_of_Alexandria|Athanasius_Of_Alexandria|  in AD  328. From then on, until 1959, the  |Pope_of_Alexandria|Pope_Of_Alexandria| , as Patriarch of All Africa, always named an Egyptian to be the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Church. On 13 July 1948, the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  reached an agreement concerning the relationship between the two churches. In 1950, the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  was granted autocephaly by  |Pope_Joseph_II_of_Alexandria|Pope_Joseph_Ii_Of_Alexandria| , head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Five Ethiopian bishops were immediately consecrated by the Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, and were empowered to elect a new Patriarch for their church. This promotion was completed when Joseph II consecrated the first Ethiopian-born Archbishop,  |Abuna_Basilios|Abuna_Basilios| , as head of the Ethiopian Church on 14 January 1951. In 1959,  |Pope_Cyril_VI_of_Alexandria|Pope_Cyril_Vi_Of_Alexandria|  crowned  |Abuna_Basilios|Abuna_Basilios|  as the first  |Patriarch_of_Ethiopia|List_Of_Abunas_Of_Ethiopia| .     Patriarch Basilios died in 1971, and was succeeded on the same year by  |Abuna_Theophilos|Abuna_Theophilos| . With the fall of Emperor  |Haile_Selassie_I_of_Ethiopia|Haile_Selassie_I_Of_Ethiopia|  in 1974, the new Marxist government arrested Abuna Theophilos and secretly executed him in 1979. The Ethiopian government then ordered the Ethiopian Church to elect  |Abuna_Takla_Haymanot|Abuna_Takla_Haymanot|  as Patriarch of Ethiopia. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Abuna Takla Haymanot on the grounds that the Synod of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Abuna Theophilos, and that the Ethiopian government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two churches were halted, although they remained in communion with each other.     After the death of Abuna Takla Haymanot in 1988,  |Abune_Merkorios|Abune_Merkorios|  who had close ties to the  |Derg|Derg|  government was elected Patriarch of Ethiopia. Following the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, Abune Merkorios abdicated under public and governmental pressure and went to exile in the United States. The newly elected Patriarch,  |Abune_Paulos|Abune_Paulos|  was officially recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1992 as the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Church|  were resumed on 13 July 2007. Abune Paulos died in August 2012.          Following the independence of  |Eritrea|Eritrea|  from Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed to  |Pope_Shenouda_III_of_Alexandria|Pope_Shenouda_Iii_Of_Alexandria|  for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. In 1994, Pope Shenouda ordained  |Abune_Phillipos|Abune_Phillipos|  as first Archbishop of Eritrea. The  |Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  obtained autocephaly on 7 May 1998, and Abune Phillipos was subsequently consecrated as first Patriarch of Eritrea. The two churches remain in full communion with each other and with the other  |Oriental_Orthodox_Churches|Oriental_Orthodox_Churches| , although the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, along with the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  does not recognize the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea,  |Abune_Antonios|Abune_Antonios| .             The Coptic Orthodox Church has a presence in many countries outside  |Egypt|Egypt| , including:    |Africa|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_Africa| |Asia|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_Asia| |Australia_and_Oceania|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_Australia| |Europe|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_Europe| |Britain_and_Ireland|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_Britain_And_Ireland| |France|French_Coptic_Orthodox_Church| |North_America|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_North_America| |United_States|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_The_United_States| |Canada|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_Canada| |Mexico|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_Mexico| |South_America|Coptic_Orthodox_Church_In_South_America|                 Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy See of St. Mark the Apostle .

The patriarch of  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  was originally known merely as bishop of Alexandria. However, this title continued to evolve as the Church grew under Theophilus and his nephew and successor  |Cyril|Cyril_Of_Alexandria|  , and especially in the 5th century when the Church developed its hierarchy.     The bishop of Alexandria, being the successor of the first bishop in Roman Egypt consecrated by  |Saint_Mark|Saint_Mark| , was honored by the other bishops as first among equals primus inter pares. Under the sixth canon of the  |Council_of_Nicaea|First_Council_Of_Nicaea| , Cyril was raised to prelate or chief bishop at the head of the episcopates of Egypt,  |Libya|Roman_Libya| , and the  |Pentapolis|Cyrenaica|  without the existence of intermediate archbishops as existed in other ecclesiastic provinces. Cannuyer, 2001, p. 40. He had the privilege of choosing and consecrating bishops.     The title of pope has been attributed to the Patriarch of Alexandria since the episcopate of  |Heraclas|Heraclas_Of_Alexandria| , the 13th Patriarch of  |Alexandria|Alexandria| . All the clergy of  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  and  |Lower_Egypt|Lower_Egypt|  honored him with the title papas, which means father as the archbishop and metropolitan having authority over all bishops, within the Egyptian province, who are under his jurisdiction.  |Alexandria|Alexandria| , while the ecclesiastical and provincial capital, also had the distinction as being the place where  |Saint_Mark|Saint_Mark|  was martyred.     The title  |Patriarch|Patriarch|  originally referred to a clan leader or head of a familial lineage. Ecclesiastically it means a bishop of high rank and was originally used as a title for the bishops of Rome, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. For the Coptic patriarch, this title was  |Patriarch|Patriarch|  of  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  and all Africa on the Holy Apostolic Throne of  |Saint_Mark|Saint_Mark|  the Evangelist, that is of Egypt . The title of Patriarch was first used around the time of the Third Ecumenical  |Council_of_Ephesus|First_Council_Of_Ephesus| , convened in AD  431, and ratified at  |Chalcedon|Council_Of_Chalcedon|  in AD  451.     It is to be noted that only the  |Patriarch_of_Alexandria|Patriarch_Of_Alexandria|  has the double title of Pope and Patriarch among the  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  and  |Oriental_Orthodox|Oriental_Orthodox|  ecumenical church heads.       The Coptic Orthodox patriarchate of Alexandria is governed by its  |Holy_Synod|The_Holy_Synod_Of_The_Coptic_Orthodox_Patriarchate_Of_Alexandria| , which is headed by the  |Patriarch_of_Alexandria|Patriarch_Of_Alexandria| .
