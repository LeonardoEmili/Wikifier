        The demographics of Nauru , an  |island_country|Island_Country|  in the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| , are known through national  |census|Census| es, which have been analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1920s. The  |Nauru_Bureau_of_Statistics|Nauru_Bureau_Of_Statistics|  have conducted this task since 1977—the first census since Nauru gained independence in 1968. The most recent census of Nauru was in 2011, when population had reached ten thousand. The population density is 478 inhabitants per square kilometre , and the overall  |life_expectancy|Life_Expectancy|  is 59.7 years. The population rose steadily from the 1960s until 2006 when the Government of Nauru repatriated thousands of Tuvaluan and  |I-Kiribati|I-Kiribati|  workers from the country. Since 1992, Naurus  |birth_rate|Birth_Rate|  has exceeded its  |death_rate|Death_Rate| ; the natural growth rate is positive.

The next was when Japanese occupied the island during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in the 1942. During this time, the Japanese deported several thousands of Nauruans to other islands. In the 1960s, the country gained independence, where the percentage of Nauruans started to increase. The most recent demographic switch was in the 2000s, when the government repatriated several non-Nauruan population from the country.

Average  |urbanisation_rate|Urbanization|  in Nauru is 100%.            With a population of ten thousand in 2011, Nauru  |ranks_around_230th_in_the_world_by_population|List_Of_Countries_By_Population| .  Its population density is 478 inhabitants per square kilometre .

The  |total_fertility_rate|Total_Fertility_Rate|  of 3.70 children per mother is one of the  |highest_in_the_Oceania|List_Of_Sovereign_States_And_Dependent_Territories_By_Fertility_Rate| . The United Nations projects the population will stay around 10,000 in the 2020s,  and the Nauru Bureau of Statistics estimates the population will increase to 20,000 in 2038.      In Naurus history, there have been six major demographics changes. The island was first inhabited by Micronesian people roughly 3,000 years ago.  The first European to find the island was  |John_Fearn|John_Fearn|  in 1798. In 1888, the country was annexed by Germany. The next demographic change came when  |Japanese_occupied_the_island|Japanese_Occupation_Of_Nauru|  during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in the 1940s.  During this time, the Japanese deported several thousands of Nauruans to other islands.  The next major demographic change was in the 1960s; the country gained independence, where the percentage of Nauruans started to increase.  The last major demographics change was in 2006 when the Government of Nauru repatriated almost all of the remaining  |Tuvaluan|Tuvaluan_People|  and  |I-Kiribati|I-Kiribati|  workers, following large scale reduction from the  |Republic_of_Nauru_Phosphate_Corporation|Nauru_Phosphate_Corporation|  and government workers.  The census of 2006 stated 9,233 people were in Nauru: down 2.13% per year from the previous census of 2002.     From 2002–11, there has been negative net migration, with an annual 109 net emigrants from 2006–11.  In 2009 there were 1,820 arrivals and 1,736 departures, for a positive rate of 84 immigrants. This was the first time since collecting data in 2002, there was a positive rate. Data on arrivals and departures collected by the Nauruan Customs and Immigration Office is not available, so specific immigration data is unavailable.  As of the 2011 census, 57% of the population over 15 years old were legally or de facto married, 35% were never married, while 7% were either widowed, separated, or divorced.  There are 1,647 households in Nauru, making an average household size of 6.0 persons per household.      Nauru is one of the most Westernized regions of the South Pacific.        For births, deaths, and fertility rates, the Nauru Bureau of Statistics was used.    For population, the  |United_States_Census_Bureaus|United_States_Census_Bureau|  mid-year estimated were used.  If a cell is shaded light green and a dagger stands beside a number, it indicates the estimate from  The World Factbook .  In 2013, the number of births and birth rate was the second-highest during this period. In 2011, the total fertility rate of 4.2 was the highest since 1992 . Since 2009, there has been a natural change of at least 200 inhabitants—the first since the reparations of the population in 2006.            Nauru, as of 2011, is mainly inhabited by  |Nauruans|Nauruan_People|  , while the main minority groups include  |Fijians|Fijians|  , Chinese , and  |Solomon_Island|Solomon_Island| ers . This shows a major change from the previous major census of 2002, when Nauruans represented 75% of the population.  According to the Constitution Nauru does not exclude any ethnic group to become a citizen.            The  |Nauruan_language|Nauruan_Language|  is the official language of Nauru. English is widely understood and is used for most government and commercial purposes.  And is  de facto  official. According to the 2011 census, 95.3% of the population speaks Nauruan, 66.0% speak English, and 11.9% speak another language. Nauruan is an  |Austronesian|Austronesian_Languages|  language, however, no adequate written grammar of the language has been compiled, and its relationships to other Micronesian languages are not well understood.                  The main religions in Nauru are  |Nauru_Congregational|Nauru_Congregational_Church|  ,  |Roman_Catholic|Catholic_Church|  ,  |Assemblies_of_God|Assemblies_Of_God|  , and  |Nauru_Independent|Nauruan_Indigenous_Religion|  .

It is still practised by 9.5% of the population, according to 2011 census. There are a few active Christian missionary organisations, including representatives of Anglicanism, Methodism, and Catholicism. The Constitution provides for  |freedom_of_religion|Freedom_Of_Religion| ;  however, the Government restricted this right in some circumstances. The government has restricted the religious practices of  |The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|The_Church_Of_Jesus_Christ_Of_Latter-Day_Saints|  and the  |Jehovahs_Witnesses|Jehovahs_Witnesses| , most of whom are foreign workers employed by RONPhos.                 |Literacy_rate|Literacy_Rate|  in Nauru, defined as people who are currently enrolled in school and/or have reached at least grade 5 of primary education ,  is 96.5%, as of 2011. There are 3,190 students and 104 teachers, as of 2013.  The 2011 census stated 4 percent of the population aged 15 years or older have a primary education, 91 percent have a secondary education, and 5 percent have a tertiary education. Education is based on the British system, which requires attendance from 5 to 16 years old. Students spend three years at preschool, six years of primary education, and four years of secondary school. Tertiary school is not required.  An estimated 10.7 percent of the GDP was spent on education in 1999.  As of 2013, there are five preschools, four primary schools, three secondary schools, and one tertiary school. The lone college,  |University_of_South_Pacific|University_Of_South_Pacific| , opened in the 1970s via distance courses, and in 1987 a campus was built on the island. It offers accounting, management, primary education, and English studies as majors.      The education system had a near-collapse in 2000–2005. During this time, exams were not held, teachers were not paid, and schools did not have enough funding to continue. As a result, over half of the schools closed. In 2009, the  |Australian_Government|Australian_Government|  partnered with the Nauruan Department of Education to help. This agreement resulted in a 5.7% increase in students, teachers with a degree increased from 30% to 93%, and over A$11 million was used to construct a new secondary school.        See  |Health_in_Nauru|Health_In_Nauru|              Net monthly income in 2006 averaged  |A$|Australian_Dollar| 2,597 . In the same year, gross monthly income averaged A$9,554 . This was calculated during the mini-census of 2006, which featured 54.4% response rate of the population.  The income was calculated using the following factors: first job salary, subsistence, other business income, second job salary, services to other households, benefits, house gifts consumed and received, and other income.  Compared to other countries that use the Australian dollar—Kiribati, Australia, and Tuvalu—Nauru ranks number one in terms of income. Since 2013, Nauru does not have a  |minimum_wage|Minimum_Wage| .      Naurus number of employed people has steadily risen and fallen. According to the 2011 census, there are 908 employed persons and 2,883 unemployed persons, making an unemployment rate of 23%. The Nauru Bureau of Statistics predicted the unemployment rate will decrease to 22% in FY2014/15.  The gross domestic product of Nauru was A$69.55 million in 2009, an increase of 40% increase from 2008. The GDP is broken down into three categories: primary , secondary , and tertiary industries.      A majority of the population are employed in phosphate mining, public administration, education, and transportation. A  |detention_centre|Nauru_Detention_Centre|  was closed in 2008, which caused the unemployment rate to rise to 30%, and approximately ten percent of the population relied on working at the centre.  The centre reopened in 2012  and currently serves 1,162 prisoners, as of May 2014.  During the 1990s, Nauru was famous for operating offshore banks, helping with  |money_laundering|Money_Laundering| . The United States State Departments International Narcotics Control Strategy Report estimated there were 400 offshore finance centres laundering an estimated $70 billion.       |Phosphate_mining_in_Nauru|Phosphate_Mining_In_Nauru|  originally made Nauru the richest per capita nation in the world.  In 1968, the  |Nauru_Phosphate_Royalties_Trust|Nauru_Phosphate_Royalties_Trust|  was created to invest profits from mining, so Nauru would have money after the mining was exhausted.  The owners of the trust purchased a fleet of ships and aircraft, a brewery in the  |Solomon_Islands|Solomon_Islands| , hotels around the world, and real estate in Australia, the United States and Britain, which causes the trust to bankrupt.  Phosphate exports peaked in 1973 with 2.3 million tonnes, but has decreased to 0.2 million tonnes in 2001.  In 2006, mining of a secondary layer of phosphate began.
