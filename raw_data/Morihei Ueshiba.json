He had been born into a farming family and spent much of his life cultivating the land, from his settlement days in Hokkaidō to his work in Ayabe trying to make the Ōmoto-kyō compound self-sufficient. He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically demanding and required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the governments restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local families at a time when food shortages were commonplace.       The government prohibition was lifted in 1948 with the creation of the Aiki Foundation, established by the Japanese Ministry of Education with permission from the Occupation forces. The Hombu dojo re-opened the following year. After the war Ueshiba effectively retired from aikido.

Aikido—usually translated as the Way of Unifying Spirit or the Way of Spiritual Harmony—is a fighting system that focuses on throws, pins and joint locks together with some striking techniques. It emphasises protecting the opponent and promotes spiritual and social development.     The technical curriculum of aikido was derived from the teachings of Takeda Sōkaku; the basic techniques of aikido stem from his Daitō-ryū system. In the earlier years of his teaching, from the 1920s to the mid-1930s, Ueshiba taught the Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu system; his early students documents bear the term Daitō-ryū.

During his lifetime, Ueshiba had three spiritual experiences that impacted greatly on his understanding of the martial arts. The first occurred in 1925, after Ueshiba had defeated a naval officers  bokken   attacks unarmed and without hurting the officer. Ueshiba then walked to his garden, where he had the following realisation:        His second experience occurred in 1940 when engaged in the ritual purification process of misogi.        His third experience was in 1942 during the worst fighting of World War II, when Ueshiba had a vision of the Great Spirit of Peace .         After these events, Ueshiba seemed to slowly grow away from Takeda, and he began to change his art.
