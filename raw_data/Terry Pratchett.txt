Pratchett was well known for his penchant for wearing large, black  |fedora|Fedora|  hats,  as seen on the inside back covers of most of his books. His style has been described as more that of urban cowboy than city gent.

You know, for two pins Id get myself a horse and a sword.  In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, with the help of his friends. He told a  Times Higher Education  interviewer that At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10  miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80  kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.  |Colin_Smythe|Colin_Smythe| , his longtime friend and agent, donated some pieces of  |meteoric_iron|Meteoric_Iron|  – thunderbolt iron has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me.      In 2013, Pratchett was named Humanist of the Year by the  |British_Humanist_Association|British_Humanist_Association|  for his campaign to fund research into Alzheimers, his contribution to the  |right_to_die|Right_To_Die|  public debate and his Humanist values.

He had a rare form of  |posterior_cortical_atrophy|Posterior_Cortical_Atrophy|  , a disease in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel.     Describing the diagnosis as an embuggerance in a radio interview, Pratchett appealed to people to keep things cheerful and proclaimed that we are taking it fairly philosophically down here and possibly with a mild optimism.  He stated he felt he had time for at least a few more books yet , and added that while he understood the impulse to ask is there anything I can do? , in this case he would only entertain such offers from very high-end experts in brain chemistry. Discussing his diagnosis at the  |Bath_Literature_Festival|Bath_Literature_Festival|  in early 2008, Pratchett revealed that by then he found it too difficult to write dedications when signing books.

In March 2008, Pratchett announced he would donate US$1,000,000 to the  |Alzheimers_Research_Trust|Alzheimers_Research_Trust| , and that he was shocked to find out that funding for Alzheimers research is just 3% of that to find cancer cures.  He said: I am, along with many others, scrabbling to stay ahead long enough to be there when the cure comes along.     In April 2008, Pratchett worked with the  |BBC|Bbc|  to make a two-part documentary series about his illness, Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimers.

He was the subject and interviewee of the 20 May 2008 edition of On the Ropes , discussing Alzheimers and how it had affected his life.     On 8 June 2008, news reports indicated that Pratchett had an experience which he described as: It is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, on the other side of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows and I dont actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head .   He went into further detail on  Front Row , in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But Im absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An  |engram|Engram| , or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from.      On 26 November 2008, Pratchett met the Prime Minister  |Gordon_Brown|Gordon_Brown|  and asked for an increase in dementia research funding.  Pratchett tested a prototype device to address his condition.   The ability of the device to alter the course of the illness has been met with skepticism from Alzheimers researchers.      In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by  |assisted_suicide|Assisted_Suicide|  before his disease progressed to a critical point. Irvine, Chris. , Telegraph, 2 August 2009. He later said he felt it should be possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with medical help, rather than suffer.  Pratchett was selected to give the 2010  |BBC|Bbc| |Richard_Dimbleby_Lecture|Richard_Dimbleby_Lecture| ,  entitled Shaking Hands With Death, broadcast on 1 February 2010.  Pratchett introduced his lecture on the topic of assisted death, but the main text was read by his friend  |Tony_Robinson|Tony_Robinson|  because Pratchetts condition made it difficult for him to read.    In June 2011 Pratchett presented a one-off BBC  |television_documentary|Television_Documentary| ,  Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die , about assisted suicide. It won the Best Documentary award at the Scottish  |BAFTAs|Bafta|  in November 2011.      In September 2012, Pratchett stated: I have to tell you that I thought Id be a lot worse than this by now, and so did my specialist. In the same interview, he stated that the cognitive part of his mind was untouched and his symptoms were physical . Grice, Elizabeth . . The Telegraph. Retrieved 2 October 2013. However, in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial  |International_Discworld_Convention|International_Discworld_Convention| , saying: the Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments .        Pratchett died at his home on the morning of 12 March 2015 from Alzheimers.   The Telegraph  reported an unidentified source as saying that despite his previous discussion of assisted suicide, his death had been natural.  After Pratchetts death, his assistant, Rob Wilkins, wrote from the official Terry Pratchett  |Twitter|Twitter|  account:     The use of  |small_capitals|Small_Capitals|  is a reference to how the character of  |Death|Death|  speaks in Pratchetts works.     Public figures who paid tribute include British Prime Minister  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron| , comedian  |Ricky_Gervais|Ricky_Gervais| ,  and authors  |Ursula_K._Le_Guin|Ursula_K._Le_Guin| ,  |Terry_Brooks|Terry_Brooks| ,  |Margaret_Atwood|Margaret_Atwood| ,  |George_R._R._Martin|George_R._R._Martin| , and  |Neil_Gaiman|Neil_Gaiman| .

His first computer was a  |Sinclair_ZX81|Sinclair_Zx81| ; the first computer he used properly for writing was an  |Amstrad_CPC_464|Amstrad_Cpc| , later replaced by a  |PC|Personal_Computer| . Pratchett was one of the first authors to routinely use the Internet to communicate with fans, and was a contributor to the  |Usenet|Usenet|  newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett from 1992.  However, he did not consider the Internet a hobby, just another thing to use . He had many computers in his house, with a bank of six  |monitors|Computer_Monitor|  rigged up to ease writing.   When he travelled, he always took a portable computer with him to write.     His background as a journalist and press officer led him to be concerned by 1995 about the spread of  |fake_news|Fake_News|  on the  |Internet|Internet| . In an interview with  |Bill_Gates|Bill_Gates| , founder of  |Microsoft|Microsoft| , he said Let’s say I call myself the Institute for Something-or-other and I decide to promote a spurious treatise saying the Jews were entirely responsible for the second world war and  |the_Holocaust|The_Holocaust|  didn’t happen, and it goes out there on the Internet and is available on the same terms as any piece of historical research which has undergone  |peer_review|Peer_Review|  and so on. There’s a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net. It’s all there: there’s no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up . Gates was optimistic and disagreed, saying that authorities on the Net would index and check facts and reputations in a much more sophisticated way than in print. But it was Pratchett who had accurately predicted how the Internet would propagate and legitimise fake news .      His experiments with computer upgrades are reflected in  |Hex|Hex| .      Pratchett was also an avid  |video_game|Video_Game|  player, and collaborated in the creation of a number of game adaptations of his books.

The red army in Interesting Times alludes to the game  Lemmings , and when asked about this connection, Pratchett stated Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Cant imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldnt get it back.  Additionally, he played  Oblivion , which he described as wonderful , and used many of its non-combat-oriented, fan-made mods.  Pratchett wrote dialogue for a mod for Oblivion which added a Nord companion named Vilja. He also worked on a similar  |mod|Skyrim_Mods|  for  Skyrim  which featured Viljas great-great-granddaughter .       He is said to have enjoyed playing the first  Tomb Raider  game.        Pratchett had a fascination with  |natural_history|Natural_History|  that he referred to many times, and he owned a greenhouse full of  |carnivorous_plants|Carnivorous_Plant| .  He described them in the biographical notes on the dust jackets of some of his books, and elsewhere Alt.Fan.Pratchett FAQ   seen November 2019 , as not as interesting as people think .  .

The final name chosen for element 117 was  tennessine  with the symbol Ts.        Pratchett was a trustee for the  |Orangutan_Foundation_UK|Orangutan_Foundation_International|   but was pessimistic about the animals future. His activities included visiting  |Borneo|Borneo|  with a  |Channel_4|Channel_4|  film crew to make an episode of Jungle Quest in 1995, seeing orangutans in their natural habitat.  Following Pratchetts lead, fan events such as the Discworld Conventions have adopted the Orangutan Foundation as their nominated charity, which has been acknowledged by the foundation.  One of Pratchetts most popular fictional characters,  |the_Librarian|The_Librarian|  of the  |Unseen_Universitys|Unseen_University|  Library, is a wizard who was transformed into an orangutan in a magical accident and decides to remain in that condition as it is so convenient for his work.

Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book signing tour;  queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as the author continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time. His fans were not restricted by age or gender, and he received a large amount of fan mail from them. Pratchett enjoyed meeting fans and hearing what they think about his books, saying that since he was well paid for his novels, his fans were everything to him.        Pratchett said that to write, you must read extensively, both inside and outside your chosen genre  and to the point of overflow . He advised that writing is hard work, and that writers must make grammar, punctuation and spelling a part of your life. However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as an unavoidable consequence , rather than the reason for writing.        Although during his early career he wrote for the sci-fi and horror genres, Pratchett later focused almost entirely on fantasy, and said: It is easier to bend the universe around the story.
