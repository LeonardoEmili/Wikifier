     Newfoundland English is a name for several  |accents|Accent|  and  |dialects|Dialect|  of  |Atlantic_Canadian_English|Atlantic_Canadian_English|  found in the province of  |Newfoundland_and_Labrador|Newfoundland_And_Labrador| . Most of these differ substantially from the English commonly spoken elsewhere in  |Canada|Canada|  and the  |North_Atlantic|North_Atlantic| . Many Newfoundland dialects are influenced by the  |West_Country_dialects|West_Country_Dialects|  of the  |West_Country|West_Country|  in England particularly the  |city_of_Bristol|City_Of_Bristol|  and counties  |Cornwall|Cornwall| ,  |Devon|Devon| ,  |Dorset|Dorset| ,  |Hampshire|Hampshire|  and  |Somerset|Somerset| , while others are influenced by dialects of Irelands southeast, particularly  |Waterford|County_Waterford| ,  |Wexford|County_Wexford| ,  |Kilkenny|County_Kilkenny|  and  |Cork|County_Cork| . Still others blend elements of both and there is also a  |Scottish|Scottish_English|   influence on the dialects – while the Scottish came in smaller numbers than the English and Irish, they had a large influence on Newfoundland society. One estimate claims 80 to 85 percent of Newfoundlands English heritage came from the southwest of the country.   Newfoundland Historical Society, A Short History of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. Johns, NL, Boulder Publications, 2008.     The dialects that compose Newfoundland English developed because of Newfoundlands history as well as its geography. Newfoundland was one of the first areas settled by England in North America, beginning in small numbers in the early 17th century  before peaking in the early 19th century. Newfoundland was a  |British|United_Kingdom|  colony until 1907 when it became an independent  |Dominion|Dominion|  within the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| . It became a part of  |Canada|Canada|  in 1949 as the last province to join confederation.  |Newfoundland|Newfoundland|  is an island in the  |North_Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean| , separated by the  |Strait_of_Belle_Isle|Strait_Of_Belle_Isle|  from  |Labrador|Labrador| , the sparsely populated mainland part of the province. Most of the population remained rather isolated on the island, allowing the dialects time to develop independently of those on the North American continent. Today, some words from Newfoundland English have been adopted through popular culture in other places in Canada .     Historically, Newfoundland English was first recognized as a separate dialect by the late 18th century when  |George_Cartwright|George_Cartwright|  published a glossary of Newfoundland words.         Newfoundland English is often called Newfinese.  The term Newfie  is also sometimes used.              Th-stopping     The to is used to represent the voiced “th” sound /ð/, and a to represent the voiceless one /θ/ e.g. “that thing over there” becomes “dat ting over dere” This is derived from  |Hiberno-English|Hiberno-English|      Slit Fricative T     The phoneme  when appearing at the end of word or between vowel sounds, is pronounced as in Hiberno-English; the most common pronunciation is as a  |slit_fricative|Slit_Fricative|  , its kind of drawn out, instead of a distinct tap of the tongue on the top of the mouth.     H-dropping     Both  |H-dropping|H-Dropping|  and H-insertion occur in many varieties of Newfoundland English - for example, Holyrood becomes “‘Olyrood” and Avondale becomes “H’Avondale”     Rhoticity     Newfoundland is a  |rhotic|Rhotic_And_Non-Rhotic_Accentsrhotic_And_Non-Rhotic_Accents_In_English|  accent like most of  |North_America|North_America| .     L-darkness     Some speakers of Newfoundland English have a weaker  |light_versus_dark_/l/_distinction|Velarized_Alveolar_Lateral_Approximant|  compared to the standard North American patterns, which may be due to Irish-settled varieties of English exhibiting light variants in both coda and onset positions.        In much of Newfoundland, the words  |fear_and_fair|English-Language_Vowel_Changes_Before_Historic_Rnear–Square_Merger|  are  |homophones|Homophones| . A similar phenomenon is found in the  |Norfolk_dialect|Norfolk_Dialect|  of  |East_Anglia|East_Anglia|  and in  |New_Zealand_English|New_Zealand_English| .     The merger of diphthongs  and  to   is extensive throughout Newfoundland and is a significant feature of Newfoundland English.     Newfoundland English traditionally lacked  |Canadian_raising|Canadian_Raising| , however in the generations since its merger with Canada this has changed to some extent.           In a move almost certainly taken from  |Hiberno-English|Hiberno-English|  and influenced by the  |Irish_language|Irish_Language| , speakers avoid using the verb to have in  |past_participles|Past_Participles| , preferring formulations including after, such as Im after telling him to stop instead of I have told him to stop. This is because in the  |Irish_language|Irish_Language|  there is no verb to have , and more particularly because Irish Gaelic uses a construction using the words Tar éis to convey the sense of having just done something – Táim tar éis é a dhéanamh meaning I am just after doing it or I have just done it . Possession is indicated by Ta ... agam literally .... is at me .       Newfoundland English often follows the  |Northern_Subject_Rule|Northern_Subject_Rule| , a legacy of settlement from South East Ireland which in turn was influenced by  |Anglo-Irish|Anglo-Irish|  settlement from  |Northern_England|Northern_England|  into Ireland.  For example, the verb to like is conjugated I likes, you likes, he/she/it likes, we likes, yous likes, and they likes.       In some communities on the islands northeast coast, you , you , and they correspond to ye, dee, and dey, respectively.       The word bes  is sometimes used in place of the normally conjugated forms of to be to describe continual actions or states of being, as in that rock usually bes under water instead of that rock is usually under water, but normal conjugation of to be is used in all other cases.     Does be is Irish grammar  |calque|Calque| d into English - there is no habitual aspect in English, so Irish speakers learning English, would say does be as a literal translation of bíonn mé I am        The use of ownership in Newfoundland English is characterized by replacing words like my or mine with me , an older form common in Irish, Scottish, Northern English and Western English dialects. Before the  |Great_Vowel_Shift|Great_Vowel_Shift| , my and me were pronounced me , mine was pronounced meen . This older usage has carried over into present-day Newfoundland English. An example would be, Wheres me hat? as opposed to Where is my hat?      The use of to to denote location is common in Newfoundland English. Wheres that to? . This is a carryover from  |West_Country_dialects|West_Country_Dialects|  and is still common in southwest England, particularly Bristol.          |Archaic|Archaism| |adverbial-intensifiers|Adverbial_Phrase|  are preserved in Newfoundland . This kind of grammar is also retained in Northern English dialects such as  |Yorkshire|Yorkshire|  and  |Geordie|Geordie|  and is sometimes heard elsewhere in Atlantic Canada.   Newfoundland dialect is not homogenous and can vary markedly from community to community as well as from region to region. This reflects both ethnic origin as well as relative isolation. For many decades Newfoundland had very few roads connecting its many communities. Fishing villages in particular remained very isolated.   In Newfoundland English the affirmative yeah is often made with an inhalation rather than an exhalation among the older generations. This is an example of a rare  |pulmonic_ingressive|Pulmonic_Ingressive| |phone|Phone| .   In Newfoundland English, it is typical for a response to a metaphorical question like Hows she cuttin? with a dry, literal response.  A proper response to the foresaid question would be Like a knife.   To non-Newfoundlanders, speakers of Newfoundland English may seem to speak faster than speakers of General Canadian. This perceived tempo difference may be a coupling of subtle pronunciation differences and unusual sayings and can be a contributing factor to the difficulty non-Newfoundlanders sometimes experience with the dialect.       There is also a dialect of  |French|French_Language|  centred mainly on the  |Port_au_Port_Peninsula|Port_Au_Port_Peninsula|  on the west coast of the island which has affected the syntax of English in the area. One example of these constructs found in Newfoundland is Throw grandpa down the stairs his hat, a  |dative|Dative|  construction in which the hat makes the trip, not the grandfather. Another is the use of French reflexive constructions in sentences such as the reply to a question like Where are you going?, reply: Me Im goin downtown .      |Newfoundland_French|Newfoundland_French|  was deliberately discouraged by the  |Newfoundland_government|Government_Of_Newfoundland_And_Labrador|  through the public schools during the mid-20th-century, and only a small handful of mainly elderly people are still fluent in the French-Newfoundland dialect. In the last couple of decades, many parents in the region have demanded and obtained French education for their children, but this would be  |Standard_French|Standard_French|  education and does not represent a continuation of the old dialect per se. Some people living in the  |Codroy_Valley|Codroy_Valley|  on the south-west tip of the island are also  |ancestrally|Ancestor| |Francophone|Francophone| , but represent  |Acadian|Acadian|  settlers from the  |Maritime_Provinces|Maritime_Provinces|  of Canada who arrived during the 19th century. This population has also lost the French language.     The greatest distinction between Newfoundland English and General Canadian English is its  |vocabulary|Vocabulary| . It includes some  |Inuit|Inuit|  and  |First_Nations|First_Nations|  words , preserved archaic English words no longer found in other English dialects ,  |Irish_language|Irish_Language|  survivals like sleveen and angishore,  |compound_words|Compound_Word|  created from English words to describe things unique to Newfoundland .
