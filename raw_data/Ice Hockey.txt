              Ice hockey is a  |contact|Contact_Sport| |team_sport|Team_Sport|  played on  |ice|Ice| , usually in a  |rink|Ice_Hockey_Rink| , in which two teams of  |skaters|Ice_Skating|  use their  |sticks|Ice_Hockey_Stick|  to  |shoot|Shot|  a  |vulcanized|Vulcanized|  rubber  |puck|Hockey_Puck|  into their opponents net to score points. The sport is known to be fast-paced and physical, with teams usually consisting of six players each: one  |goaltender|Goaltender| , and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a  |goal|Goal|  against the opposing team.     Ice hockey is most popular in  |Canada|Ice_Hockey_In_Canada| , central and eastern  |Europe|Europe| , the  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries| ,  |Russia|Russia|  and the  |United_States|Ice_Hockey_In_The_United_States| . Ice hockey is the official  |national_winter_sport|National_Sport|  of Canada.  |National_Sports_of_Canada_Act|S:National_Sports_Of_Canada_Act|  In addition, ice hockey is the most popular winter  |sport_in_Belarus|Sport_In_Belarus| ,  |Croatia|Sport_In_Croatia| , the  |Czech_Republic|Sport_In_The_Czech_Republic| ,  |Finland|Sport_In_Finland| ,  |Latvia|Sport_In_Latvia| ,  |Russia|Sport_In_Russia| ,  |Slovakia|Sport_In_Slovakia| ,  |Sweden|Sport_In_Sweden| , and  |Switzerland|Sport_In_Switzerland| .  |North_Americas|North_America| |National_Hockey_League|National_Hockey_League|  is the highest level for mens ice hockey and the strongest professional ice hockey league in the world. The  |Kontinental_Hockey_League|Kontinental_Hockey_League|  is the highest league in Russia and much of  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| . The  |International_Ice_Hockey_Federation|International_Ice_Hockey_Federation|  is the formal governing body for international ice hockey, with the IIHF managing international tournaments and maintaining the  |IIHF_World_Ranking|Iihf_World_Ranking| . Worldwide, there are ice hockey federations in 76 countries.      In Canada, the United States, Nordic countries, and some other European countries the sport is known simply as hockey; the name ice hockey is used in places where hockey more often refers to the more popular  |field_hockey|Field_Hockey| , such as countries in  |South_America|South_America| ,  |Asia|Asia| ,  |Africa|Ice_Hockey_In_Africa| ,  |Australasia|Australasia| , and some European countries including the  |United_Kingdom|Sport_In_The_United_Kingdom| ,  |Ireland|Sport_In_Ireland|  and the  |Netherlands|Sport_In_The_Netherlands| .      Ice hockey is believed to have evolved from simple stick and ball games played in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as  |shinny|Shinny|  and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in  |Montreal|Montreal| , where the  |first_indoor_hockey_game|First_Indoor_Hockey_Game|  was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and  |professional_ice_hockey|Professional_Ice_Hockey|  originated around 1900. The  |Stanley_Cup|Stanley_Cup| , emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the  |Olympics|Ice_Hockey_At_The_Olympic_Games|  during the  |1920_Summer_Olympics|1920_Summer_Olympics| .     In international competitions, the national teams of six countries  predominate:  |Canada|Canada_Mens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team| ,  |Czech_Republic|Czech_Republic_Mens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team| ,  |Finland|Finland_Mens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team| ,  |Russia|Russia_Mens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team| ,  |Sweden|Sweden_Mens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team|  and  |the_United_States|United_States_Mens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team| . Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in mens competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries . In the annual  |Ice_Hockey_World_Championships|Ice_Hockey_World_Championships| , 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953. Including former incarnations of them, such as  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  or the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| .  The  |World_Cup_of_Hockey|World_Cup_Of_Hockey|  is organized by the National Hockey League and the  |National_Hockey_League_Players_Association|National_Hockey_League_Players_Association|  , unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHLs  |Stanley_Cup_playoffs|Stanley_Cup_Playoffs| . Furthermore, all 12 Womens Olympic and 36  |IIHF_World_Womens_Championships|Iihf_World_Womens_Championships|  medals were awarded to one of these six countries. The  |Canadian_national_team|Canada_Womens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team|  or the  |United_States_national_team|United_States_Womens_National_Ice_Hockey_Team|  have between them won every gold medal of either series.            NameJuvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education, by Richard Johnson , whose chapter XI was titled New Improvements on the Game of Hockey .  The 1573 Statute of Galway banned a sport called hokie—the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves . A form of this word was thus being used in the 16th century, though much removed from its current usage.      The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by  |King_Edward_III_of_England|Edward_Iii_Of_England|   is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam .   The English historian and biographer  |John_Strype|John_Strype|  did not use the word hockey when he translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating Canibucam as Cambuck ;  this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet.      According to the Austin Hockey Association, the word puck derives from the  |Scottish_Gaelic|Scottish_Gaelic_Language|  puc or the  |Irish|Irish_Language|  poc . ...The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his camán or hurley is always called a puck.              Stick-and-ball games date back to pre-Christian times. In Europe, these games included the Irish game of  |hurling|Hurling| , the closely related Scottish game of  |shinty|Shinty|  and versions of  |field_hockey|Field_Hockey|  .  |IJscolf|Ijscolf| , a game resembling  |colf|Kolven|  on an ice-covered surface, was popular in the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries|  between the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  and the  |Dutch_Golden_Age|Dutch_Golden_Age| . It was played with a wooden curved bat , a wooden or leather ball and two poles , with the objective to hit the chosen point using the least number of strokes. A similar game  had been played for a thousand years or more by the  |Scandinavian|North_Germanic_Peoples|  peoples, as documented in the  |Icelandic_sagas|Sagas_Of_Icelanders| .  |Polo|Polo|  has been referred to as hockey on horseback .  In England, field hockey developed in the late 17th century, and there is evidence that some games of field hockey took place on the ice. These games of hockey on ice were sometimes played with a  |bung|Bung|  . William Pierre Le Cocq stated, in a 1799 letter written in  |Chesham|Chesham| , England:     I must now describe to you the game of Hockey; we have each a stick turning up at the end. We get a bung. There are two sides one of them knocks one way and the other side the other way. If any one of the sides makes the bung reach that end of the churchyard it is victorious.      A 1797 engraving unearthed by  |Swedish|Sweden|  sport historians Carl Gidén and Patrick Houda shows a person on  |skates|Ice_Skate|  with a stick and bung on the  |River_Thames|River_Thames| , probably in December 1796.      British soldiers and immigrants to Canada and the United States brought their stick-and-ball games with them and played them on the ice and snow of winter. In 1825,  |John_Franklin|John_Franklin|  wrote The game of hockey played on the ice was the morning sport on  |Great_Bear_Lake|Great_Bear_Lake|  during one of his  |Arctic|Arctic|  expeditions. A mid-1830s watercolour portrays New Brunswick lieutenant-governor Archibald Campbell and his family with British soldiers on skates playing a stick-on-ice sport. Captain R.G.A. Levinge, a British Army officer in New Brunswick during Campbells time, wrote about hockey on ice on Chippewa Creek in 1839. In 1843 another British Army officer in  |Kingston,_Ontario|Kingston,_Ontario|  wrote, Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice. An 1859 Boston Evening Gazette article referred to an early game of hockey on ice in Halifax that year. An 1835 painting by John OToole depicts skaters with sticks and bung on a frozen stream in the American state of  |West_Virginia|West_Virginia| , at that time still part of  |Virginia|Virginia| .     In the same era, the  |Mikmaq|Mikmaq| , a  |First_Nations|First_Nations|  people of the  |Canadian_Maritimes|The_Maritimes| , also had a stick-and-ball game. Canadian  |oral_histories|Oral_History|  describe a traditional stick-and-ball game played by the Mikmaq, and  |Silas_Tertius_Rand|Silas_Tertius_Rand|   describes a Mikmaq ball game known as tooadijik. Rand also describes a game played with  |hurleys|Hurley| , known as wolchamaadijik. Dalhousie University .  . From Thomas Raddall to Douglas M. Fisher, January 25, 1954. MS-2-202 41.14. Sticks made by the Mikmaq were used by the British for their games.          Early 19th-century paintings depict  |shinney|Shinney|  , an early form of hockey with no standard rules which was played in Nova Scotia.  Many of these early games absorbed the physical aggression of what the  |Onondaga|Onondaga_Language|  called dehuntshigwaes .  Shinney was played on the  |St._Lawrence_River|St._Lawrence_River|  at  |Montreal|Montreal|  and  |Quebec_City|Quebec_City| , and in Kingston and  |Ottawa|Ottawa| . The number of players was often large. To this day, shinney is a popular Canadian  term for  |an_informal_type_of_hockey|Pond_Hockey| , either ice or  |street_hockey|Street_Hockey| .      |Thomas_Chandler_Haliburton|Thomas_Chandler_Haliburton| , in The Attache: Second Series imagined a dialogue, between two of the novels characters, which mentions playing hurly on the long pond on the ice . This has been interpreted by some historians from  |Windsor,_Nova_Scotia|Windsor,_Nova_Scotia|  as reminiscent of the days when the author was a student at  |Kings_College_School|Kings-Edgehill_School|  in that town in 1810 and earlier.  Based on Haliburtons quote, claims were made that modern hockey was invented in Windsor, Nova Scotia, by Kings College students and perhaps named after an individual . Others claim that the origins of hockey come from games played in the area of Dartmouth and Halifax in Nova Scotia. However, several references have been found to hurling and shinty being played on the ice long before the earliest references from both Windsor and Dartmouth/Halifax,  and the word hockey was used to designate a stick-and-ball game at least as far back as 1773, as it was mentioned in the book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson , whose chapter XI was titled New Improvements on the Game of Hockey .              While the games origins lie elsewhere, Montreal is at the centre of the development of the sport of contemporary ice hockey, and is recognized as the birthplace of organized ice hockey.  On March 3, 1875, the  |first_organized_indoor_game|First_Indoor_Hockey_Game|  was played at Montreals  |Victoria_Skating_Rink|Victoria_Skating_Rink|  between two nine-player teams, including  |James_Creighton|James_Creighton|  and several  |McGill_University|Mcgill_University|  students. Instead of a ball or bung, the game featured a flat circular piece of wood  . The goal posts were  apart .     In 1876, games played in Montreal were conducted under the Hockey Association rules ;  the Hockey Association was Englands field hockey organization. In 1877, The Gazette published a list of seven rules, six of which were largely based on six of the Hockey Associations twelve rules, with only minor differences ; the one added rule explained how disputes should be settled.  The  |McGill_University_Hockey_Club|Mcgill_Redmen| , the first ice hockey club, was founded in 1877  . In 1880, the number of players per side was reduced from nine to seven.     The number of teams grew, enough to hold the first world championship of ice hockey at Montreals annual  |Winter_Carnival|Montreal_Winter_Carnival_Ice_Hockey_Tournaments|  in 1883. The McGill team won the tournament and was awarded the Carnival Cup. The trophy for this tournament is on display at the Musee  |McCord_Museum|Mccord_Museum|  in Montreal. A picture of this trophy can be seen at  The game was divided into thirty-minute halves. The positions were now named:  |left_and_right_wing|Winger| ,  |centre|Centre| ,  |rover|Rover| ,  |point_and_cover-point|Defencemanhistorical_Designations| , and  |goaltender|Goaltender| .  In 1886, the teams competing at the Winter Carnival organized the  |Amateur_Hockey_Association_of_Canada|Amateur_Hockey_Association_Of_Canada|  , and played a season comprising challenges to the existing champion.         In Europe, it is believed that in 1885 the  |Oxford_University_Ice_Hockey_Club|Oxford_University_Ice_Hockey_Club|  was formed to play the first  |Ice_Hockey_Varsity_Match|Ice_Hockey_Varsity_Match|  against traditional rival  |Cambridge|Cambridge_University_Ice_Hockey_Club|  in St. Moritz, Switzerland; however, this is undocumented. The match was won by the Oxford Dark Blues, 6–0;  Cambridge Evening News, Sporting Heritage is Found, July 26, 2003. the first photographs and team lists date from 1895.  This rivalry continues, claiming to be the oldest hockey rivalry in history; a similar claim is made about the rivalry between  |Queens_University|Queens_University|  and  |Royal_Military_College|Royal_Military_College_Of_Canada|  of Kingston, Ontario. Since 1986, considered the 100th anniversary of the rivalry, teams of the two colleges play for the Carr-Harris Cup.      In 1888, the  |Governor_General_of_Canada|Governor_General_Of_Canada| ,  |Lord_Stanley_of_Preston|Frederick_Stanley,_16Th_Earl_Of_Derby|  , first attended the Montreal Winter Carnival tournament and was impressed with the game. In 1892, realizing that there was no recognition for the best team in Canada , he purchased a silver bowl for use as a trophy. The Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup  was first awarded in  |1893|1893_Ahac_Season|  to the  |Montreal_Hockey_Club|Montreal_Hockey_Club| , champions of the AHAC; it continues to be awarded annually to the National Hockey Leagues championship team.  Stanleys son Arthur helped organize the  |Ontario_Hockey_Association|Ontario_Hockey_Association| , and Stanleys daughter  |Isobel|Lady_Isobel_Gathorne-Hardy|  was one of the first women to play ice hockey.     By 1893, there were almost a hundred teams in Montreal alone; in addition, there were leagues throughout Canada.  |Winnipeg|Winnipeg|  hockey players used  |cricket|Cricket|  pads to better protect the  |goaltenders|Goaltender|  legs; they also introduced the scoop shot, or what is now known as the wrist shot.  |William_Fairbrother|William_Fairbrother| , from  |Ontario|Ontario| , Canada is credited with inventing the ice hockey net in the 1890s.  Goal nets became a standard feature of the  |Canadian_Amateur_Hockey_League|Canadian_Amateur_Hockey_League|  in 1900. Left and right defence began to replace the point and cover-point positions in the OHA in 1906.     In the United States, ice polo, played with a ball rather than a puck, was popular during this period; however, by 1893  |Yale_University|Yale_University|  and  |Johns_Hopkins_University|Johns_Hopkins_University|  held their first ice hockey matches.  American financier  |Malcolm_Greene_Chace|Malcolm_Greene_Chace|  is credited with being the father of hockey in the United States.  In 1892, as an amateur tennis player, Chace visited  |Niagara_Falls,_New_York|Niagara_Falls,_New_York|  for a tennis match, where he met some Canadian hockey players. Soon afterwards, Chace put together a team of men from Yale,  |Brown|Brown_University| , and  |Harvard|Harvard_College| , and toured across Canada as captain of this team. The first collegiate hockey match in the United States was played between Yale University and Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Yale, led by captain Chace, beat Hopkins, 2–1.  In 1896, the first ice hockey league in the US was formed. The US Amateur Hockey League was founded in New York City, shortly after the opening of the artificial-ice  |St._Nicholas_Rink|St._Nicholas_Rink| .        Lord Stanleys five sons were instrumental in bringing ice hockey to Europe, defeating a court team  at  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace|  in 1895.  By 1903, a five-team league had been founded. The Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace was founded in 1908 to govern international competition, and the first European championship was won by Great Britain in 1910. The sport grew further in Europe in the 1920s, after ice hockey became an Olympic sport. Many  |bandy|Bandy|  players switched to hockey so as to be able to compete in the Olympics.  E.g. in the Netherlands, see  Bandy remained popular in the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , which only started its ice hockey program in the 1950s. In the mid-20th century, the Ligue became the  |International_Ice_Hockey_Federation|International_Ice_Hockey_Federation| .         As the popularity of ice hockey as a spectator sport grew, earlier rinks were replaced by larger rinks. Most of the early indoor ice rinks have been demolished; Montreals Victoria Rink, built in 1862, was demolished in 1925.  Many older rinks succumbed to fire, such as  |Denman_Arena|Denman_Arena| ,  |Deys_Arena|Deys_Arena| ,  |Quebec_Skating_Rink|Quebec_Skating_Rink|  and  |Montreal_Arena|Montreal_Arena| , a hazard of the buildings wood construction. The  |Stannus_Street_Rink|Stannus_Street_Rink|  in Windsor, Nova Scotia may be the oldest still in existence; however, it is no longer used for hockey. The  |Aberdeen_Pavilion|Aberdeen_Pavilion|  in Ottawa was used for hockey in 1904 and is the oldest existing facility that has hosted Stanley Cup games.     The oldest indoor ice hockey arena still in use today for hockey is  |Bostons|Boston| |Matthews_Arena|Matthews_Arena| , which was built in 1910. It has been modified extensively several times in its history and is used today by  |Northeastern_University|Northeastern_University|  for hockey and other sports. It was the original home rink of the  |Boston_Bruins|Boston_Bruins|  professional team,  itself the oldest United States-based team in the NHL, starting play in the league in todays Matthews Arena on December 1, 1924.  |Madison_Square_Garden|Madison_Square_Garden|  in New York City, built in 1968, is the oldest continuously-operating arena in the NHL.               |Professional|Professional_Sports|  hockey has existed since the early 20th century. By 1902, the  |Western_Pennsylvania_Hockey_League|Western_Pennsylvania_Hockey_League|  was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league—the  |International_Professional_Hockey_League|International_Professional_Hockey_League|  —in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players . The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada .     In 1910, the  |National_Hockey_Association|National_Hockey_Association|  was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.     Professional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss  |National_League_A|National_League_A| , founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the  |Kontinental_Hockey_League|Kontinental_Hockey_League| , the  |Czech_Extraliga|Czech_Extraliga| , the Finnish  |Liiga|Liiga|  and the  |Swedish_Hockey_League|Swedish_Hockey_League| .             While the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular  |code_of_play|Ice_Hockey_Rules|  being used. The two most important codes are those of the IIHF  and the NHL.  Both of the codes, and others, originated from Canadian rules of ice hockey of the early 20th Century.     Ice hockey is played on a  hockey rink . During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score  goals  by shooting a hard  |vulcanized|Vulcanization|  rubber disc, the  puck , into the opponents goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.     Within certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponents goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.     Hockey is an  |off-side|Offside|  game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.     The six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term skaters is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The  forward  positions consist of a  centre  and two  wingers left wing and a right wing. Forwards often play together as units or lines, with the same three forwards always playing together. The  defencemen  usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a line change. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when  short-handed  or on a  power play . The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the crease in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing on the fly. A new NHL rule added in the 2005–06 season prevents a team from changing their line after they  ice  the puck.     The boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to  |bodycheck|Bodycheck|  opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are in play and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a  |faceoff|Faceoff| . Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.     The three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: offside, icing, and the puck going out of play. A player is offside if he enters his  |opponents_zone|Hockey_Rinkzones|  before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not ice the puck , shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponents goal line. The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink  and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.     Under IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the  |fourth_line|Fourth_Line|  as a forward.       A professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and childrens leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.     Various procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour sudden death overtime , in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999–2000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none .     From the 1999–2000 until the 2003–04 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side . In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon , in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015–16 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized teams penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.      International play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL , now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999–2000 to 2003–04 followed by a  |penalty_shootout|Shootout| . If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a  sudden death  format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.     The overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the medal games in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.               In ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a penalty to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the  penalty box  and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. Minor penalties last for two minutes, major penalties last for five minutes, and a double minor penalty is two consecutive penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing short-handed while the opposing team is on a  power play .     A two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as  |tripping|Tripping| ,  |elbowing|Elbow| ,  |roughing|Roughing| ,  |high-sticking|High-Sticking| ,  |delay_of_the_game|Delay_Of_Game| ,  |too_many_players_on_the_ice|Too_Many_Men| ,  |boarding|Boarding| , illegal equipment,  |charging|Charging|  , holding, holding the stick , interference,  |hooking|Hooking| ,  |slashing|Slashing| , kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct , butt-ending , spearing , or  |cross-checking|Cross-Checking| . As of the 2005–2006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for  |diving|Diving| , where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury , as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding  is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.     Some varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player . This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players until one or both penalties expire ; this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute misconduct penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct . In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent , or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface ; meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box . In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.     A  |penalty_shot|Penalty_Shot|  is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a  |breakaway|Breakaway| . A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.        Officials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using ones hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in ones defensive zone .     In the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the corners of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalies team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net the goalie can play the puck.     An additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the  |two-line_offside_pass|Two-Line_Pass| . Prior to the 2005–06 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a teams defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.     The NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and clutching and grabbing among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game .     In mens hockey, but not in womens, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called  body checking . Not all physical contact is legal—in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.     A delayed penalty call occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States  |National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|  for  |college_level_hockey|College_Ice_Hockey| . In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.           A typical game of hockey is governed by two to four  officials  on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two linesmen who are mainly responsible for calling offside and  |icing|Icing|  violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,  and one or two referees,  who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.  The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.     The most widespread system in use today is the three-man system , that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the four-official system , where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at  |IIHF_World_Championships|Ice_Hockey_World_Championships| , the  |Olympics|Olympics|  and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.     Officials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies  |Hockey_Canada|Hockey_Canada|  and  |USA_Hockey|Usa_Hockey|  approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.  USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.                Since mens ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet , shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts or a girdle, athletic cup , shin pads, skates, and a neck protector.      |Goaltenders|Ice_Hockey_Goaltending_Equipment|  use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100  mph they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates , a jock or jill, large leg pads , blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.     Hockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skaters feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness , and curvature .
