             The diesel engine , named after  |Rudolf_Diesel|Rudolf_Diesel| , is an  |internal_combustion_engine|Internal_Combustion_Engine|  in which  |ignition|Combustion|  of the  |fuel|Diesel_Fuel|  is caused by the elevated temperature of the air in the cylinder due to the mechanical compression . This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a  |petrol_engine|Petrol_Engine|   or  |gas_engine|Gas_Engine|  , which use a  |spark_plug|Spark_Plug|  to ignite an air-fuel mixture.     Diesel engines work by compressing only the air. This increases the air temperature inside the  |cylinder|Cylinder|  to such a high degree that atomised diesel fuel injected into the combustion chamber ignites spontaneously. With the fuel being injected into the air just before combustion, the dispersion of the fuel is uneven; this is called a heterogeneous air-fuel mixture. The torque a diesel engine produces is controlled by manipulating the air ratio; instead of throttling the intake air, the diesel engine relies on altering the amount of fuel that is injected, and the air ratio is usually high.     The diesel engine has the highest  |thermal_efficiency|Thermal_Efficiency|   of any practical  |internal|Internal_Combustion|  or  |external_combustion|External_Combustion|  engine due to its very high  |expansion_ratio|Expansion_Ratio|  and inherent  |lean|Air–Fuel_Ratio|  burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air. A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared to two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburned fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust. Low-speed diesel engines can reach effective efficiencies of up to 55%.     Diesel engines may be designed as either  |two_stroke|Two_Stroke|  or  |four_stroke|Four_Stroke|  cycles. They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary  |steam_engines|Steam_Engine| . Since the 1910s they have been used in  |submarines|Submarine|  and ships. Use in locomotives, trucks,  |heavy_equipment|Heavy_Equipment|  and electricity generation plants followed later. In the 1930s, they slowly began to be used in a few  |automobiles|Automobile| . Since the 1970s, the use of diesel engines in larger on-road and  |off_road_vehicles|Off_Road_Vehicle|  in the US has increased. According to Konrad Reif, the  |EU|European_Union|  average for diesel cars accounts for half of newly registered cars.     The worlds largest diesel engines put in service are 14-cylinder, two-stroke watercraft diesel engines; they produce a peak power of almost 100  MW each.                                 In 1878,  |Rudolf_Diesel|Rudolf_Diesel| , who was a student at the  |_Polytechnikum_|Technical_University_Of_Munichfoundation_Of_Polytechnische_Schule_München|  in  |Munich|Munich| , attended the lectures of  |Carl_von_Linde|Carl_Von_Linde| . Linde explained that steam engines are capable of converting just 6–10% of the heat energy into work, but that the  |Carnot_cycle|Carnot_Cycle|  allows conversion of all the heat energy into work by means of isothermal change in condition. According to Diesel, this ignited the idea of creating a highly efficient engine that could work on the Carnot cycle. Diesel was also exposed to a  |fire_piston|Fire_Piston| , a traditional  |fire_starter|Fire_Starter|  using rapid  |adiabatic|Adiabatic|  compression principles which Linde had acquired from  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia| .  After several years of working on his ideas, Diesel published them in 1893 in the essay  |Theory_and_Construction_of_a_Rational_Heat_Motor|Theory_And_Construction_Of_A_Rational_Heat_Motor| .     Diesel was heavily criticised for his essay, but only few found the mistake that he made; his rational heat motor was supposed to utilise a constant temperature cycle that would require a much higher level of compression than that needed for compression ignition. Diesels idea was to compress the air so tightly that the temperature of the air would exceed that of combustion. However, such an engine could never perform any usable work. In his 1892 US patent 542846 Diesel describes the compression required for his cycle:   : pure atmospheric air is compressed, according to curve 1 2, to such a degree that, before ignition or combustion takes place, the highest pressure of the diagram and the highest temperature are obtained-that is to say, the temperature at which the subsequent combustion has to take place, not the burning or igniting point. To make this more clear, let it be assumed that the subsequent combustion shall take place at a temperature of 700°. Then in that case the initial pressure must be sixty-four atmospheres, or for 800° centigrade the pressure must be ninety atmospheres, and so on. Into the air thus compressed is then gradually introduced from the exterior finely divided fuel, which ignites on introduction, since the air is at a temperature far above the igniting-point of the fuel. The characteristic features of the cycle according to my present invention are therefore, increase of pressure and temperature up to the maximum, not by combustion, but prior to combustion by mechanical compression of air, and there upon the subsequent performance of work without increase of pressure and temperature by gradual combustion during a prescribed part of the stroke determined by the cut-oil .     By June 1893, Diesel had realised his original cycle would not work and he adopted the constant pressure cycle. Diesel describes the cycle in his 1895 patent application. Notice that there is no longer a mention of compression temperatures exceeding the temperature of combustion. Now it is simply stated that the compression must be sufficient to trigger ignition.   : 1. In an internal-combustion engine, the combination of a cylinder and piston constructed and arranged to compress air to a degree producing a temperature above the igniting-point of the fuel, a supply for compressed air or gas; a fuel-supply; a distributing-valve for fuel, a passage from the air supply to the cylinder in communication with the fuel-distributing valve, an inlet to the cylinder in communication with the air-supply and with the fuel-valve, and a cut-oil, substantially as described. See US patent 608845 filed 1895 / granted 1898     In 1892, Diesel received patents in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States for Method of and Apparatus for Converting Heat into Work . In 1894 and 1895, he filed patents and addenda in various countries for his engine; the first patents were issued in Spain  , France and Belgium in December 1894, and in Germany in 1895 and the United States in 1898.     Diesel was attacked and criticised over a time period of several years. Critics have claimed that Diesel never invented a new motor and that the invention of the diesel engine is fraud. Otto Köhler and Emil Capitaine were two of the most prominent critics of Diesels time. Köhler had published an essay in 1887 in which he describes an engine similar to the engine Diesel describes in his 1893 essay. Köhler figured that such an engine could not perform any work. Emil Capitaine had built a petroleum engine with glow-tube ignition in the early 1890s; he claimed against his own better judgement, that his glow-tube ignition engine worked the same way Diesels engine did. His claims were unfounded and he lost a patent lawsuit against Diesel. Other engines, such as the  |Akroyd_engine|Hot_Bulb_Engine|  and the  |Brayton_engine|Brayton_Engine| , also use an operating cycle that is different from the diesel engine cycle. Friedrich Sass says that the diesel engine is Diesels very own work and that any Diesel myth is  |falsification_of_history|Falsification_Of_History|  .         Diesel sought out firms and factories that would build his engine. With the help of  |Moritz_Schröter|Moritz_Schröter|  and  |Max_Friedrich_Gutermuth|Max_Friedrich_Gutermuth| , he succeeded in convincing both  |Krupp|Krupp|  in Essen and the  |Maschinenfabrik_Augsburg|Man_Se| . Contracts were signed in April 1893, and in early summer 1893, Diesels first prototype engine was built in Augsburg. On 10 August 1893, the first ignition took place, the fuel used was petrol. In winter 1893/1894, Diesel redesigned the existing engine, and by 18 January 1894, his mechanics had converted it into the second prototype. On February 17, 1894, the redesigned engine ran for 88 revolutions – one minute; with this news, Maschinenfabrik Augsburgs stock rose by 30%, indicative of the tremendous anticipated demands for a more efficient engine. On 26 June 1895 the engine achieved an effective efficiency of 16.6% and had a fuel consumption of 519  g·kW −1 ·h −1 .   However, despite proving the concept, the engine caused problems, and Diesel could not achieve any substantial progress. Therefore, Krupp considered rescission of the contract they had made with Diesel. Diesel was forced to improve the design of his engine and rushed to construct a third prototype engine. Between 8 November and 20 December 1895, the second prototype had successfully covered over 111 hours on the test bench. In the January 1896 report, this was considered a success.     In February 1896, Diesel considered supercharging the third prototype. Imanuel Lauster, who was ordered to draw the third prototype, had finished the drawings by 30 April 1896. During summer that year the engine was built, it was completed on 6 October 1896. Tests were conducted until early 1897. First public tests began on 1 February 1897.  |Moritz_Schröters|Moritz_Schröter|  test on 17 February 1897 was the main test of Diesels engine. The engine was rated 13.1  kW with a specific fuel consumption of 324  g·kW −1 ·h −1 , resulting in an effective efficiency of 26.2% . By 1898, Diesel had become a millionaire.         1893:  |Rudolf_Diesels|Rudolf_Diesel|  essay titled  Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor  appears.   1893: February 21, Diesel and the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg sign a contract that allows Diesel to build a prototype engine.   1893: February 23, Diesel obtains a patent titled Arbeitsverfahren und Ausführungsart für Verbrennungsmaschinen .   1893: April 10, Diesel and Krupp sign a contract that allows Diesel to build a prototype engine.   1893: April 24, both Krupp and the Maschinenfabrik Augsburg decide to collaborate and build just a single prototype in Augsburg.   1893: July, the first prototype is completed.   1893: August 10, Diesel injects fuel for the first time, resulting in combustion, destroying the indicator.   1893: November, Diesel applies for a patent for a modified combustion process.    1894: January 18, after the first prototype had been modified to become the second prototype, testing with the second prototype begins.   1894: February 17, The second prototype runs for the first time.   1895: March 30, Diesel applies for a patent for a starting process with compressed air.   1895: June 26, the second prototype passes brake testing for the first time.   1895: Diesel applies for a second patent US Patent 608845   1895: November 8 – December 20, a series of tests with the second prototype is conducted.

The characteristics of a diesel engine are   Compression ignition: Due to almost adiabatic compression, the fuel ignites without any ignition-initiating apparatus such as spark plugs.   Mixture formation inside the combustion chamber: Air and fuel are mixed in the combustion chamber and not in the inlet manifold.   Engine speed adjustment solely by mixture quality: Instead of throttling the air-fuel mixture, the amount of torque produced is set solely by the mass of injected fuel, always mixed with as much air as possible.

The inline-six-cylinder design is the most prolific in light- to medium-duty engines, though inline-four engines are also common. Small-capacity engines are generally four- or six-cylinder types, with the four-cylinder being the most common type found in automotive uses. The V configuration used to be common for commercial vehicles, but it has been abandoned in favour of the inline configuration.       Günter Mau categorises diesel engines by their rotational speeds into three groups:   High-speed engines .     Source       High-speed engines are used to power  |trucks|Truck|  ,  |bus|Bus| es,  |tractors|Tractor| ,  |cars|Automobile| ,  |yachts|Yacht| ,  |compressors|Gas_Compressor| ,  |pumps|Pump|  and small  |electrical_generators|Electrical_Generator| . As of 2018, most high-speed engines have  |direct_injection|Direct_Fuel_Injection| . Many modern engines, particularly in on-highway applications, have  |common_rail|Common_Rail| |_direct_injection|Direct_Fuel_Injection| . On bigger ships, high-speed diesel engines are often used for powering electric generators. The highest power output of high-speed diesel engines is approximately 5  MW.       Medium-speed engines are used in large electrical generators, ship propulsion and mechanical drive applications such as large compressors or pumps. Medium speed diesel engines operate on either diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil by direct injection in the same manner as low-speed engines. Usually, they are four-stroke engines with trunk pistons.     The power output of medium-speed diesel engines can be as high as 21,870  kW, with the effective efficiency being around 47...48% . Most larger medium-speed engines are started with compressed air direct on pistons, using an air distributor, as opposed to a pneumatic starting motor acting on the flywheel, which tends to be used for smaller engines.     Medium-speed engines intended for marine applications are usually used to power ferries, passenger ships or small freight ships. Using medium-speed engines reduces the cost of smaller ships and increases their transport capacity. In addition to that, a single ship can use two smaller engines instead of one big engine, which increases the ships safety.            Low-speed diesel engines are usually very large in size and mostly used to power  |ships|Ship| . There are two different types of low-speed engines that are commonly used: Two-stroke engines with a crosshead, and four-stroke engines with a regular trunk-piston. Two-stroke engines have a limited rotational frequency and their charge exchange is more difficult, which means that they are usually bigger than four-stroke engines and used to directly power a ships propeller. Four-stroke engines on ships are usually used to power an electric generator. An electric motor powers the propeller. Both types are usually very undersquare. Low-speed diesel engines often have an effective efficiency of up to 55% . Like medium-speed engines, low-speed engines are started with compressed air, and they use heavy oil as their primary fuel.             |Two_stroke_diesel_engines|Two_Stroke_Diesel_Engine|  use only two strokes instead of four strokes for a complete engine cycle. Filling the cylinder with air and compressing it takes place in one stroke, and the power and exhaust strokes are combined. The compression in a two-stroke diesel engine is similar to the compression that takes place in a four-stroke diesel engine: As the piston passes through bottom centre and starts upward, compression commences, culminating in fuel injection and ignition. Instead of a full set of valves, two-stroke diesel engines have simple intake ports, and exhaust ports . When the piston approaches bottom dead centre, both the intake and the exhaust ports are open , which means that there is atmospheric pressure inside the cylinder. Therefore, some sort of pump is required to blow the air into the cylinder and the combustion gasses into the exhaust. This process is called scavenging. The pressure required is approximately 10 - 30  kPa.     ;Scavenging     In general, there are three types of scavenging possible:   Uniflow scavenging   Crossflow scavenging    |Reverse_flow_scavenging|Schnuerle_Porting|      Crossflow scavenging is incomplete and limits the stroke, yet some manufacturers used it. Reverse flow scavenging is a very simple way of scavenging, and it was popular amongst manufacturers until the early 1980s. Uniflow scavenging is more complicated to make but allows the highest fuel efficiency; since the early 1980s, manufacturers such as MAN and Sulzer have switched to this system. It is standard for modern marine two-stroke diesel engines.         So-called dual-fuel diesel engines or gas diesel engines burn two different types of fuel simultaneously, for instance, a gaseous fuel and diesel engine fuel. The diesel engine fuel auto-ignites due to compression ignition, and then ignites the gaseous fuel. Such engines do not require any type of spark ignition and operate similar to regular diesel engines.                |Torque|Torque|  is a force applied to a lever at a right angle multiplied by the lever length. This means that the torque an engine produces depends on the displacement of the engine and the force that the gas pressure inside the cylinder applies to the piston, commonly referred to as effective piston pressure |Torque|Torque|  pe .. Effective piston  |pressure|Pressure|  Vh ..  |Displacement|Engine_Displacement|  i ..  |Strokes|Stroke|      ;Example   Engine A: effective piston pressure570 kN·m −2 , displacement 2.2 dm 3 , strokes 4, torque 100 N·m   : 570   2.2       4   100     Power is the quotient of work and time:     : P 2  n M   :: P ..  |Power|Power|  M ..  |Torque|Torque|  n ..  |Time|Time|      :which means:     : P 2  n1   M   60   :: P ..  |Power|Power|  M ..  |Torque|Torque|  n1 ..  |Time|Time|      ;Example   Engine A: Power≈ 44,000 W, torque 100 N·m, time 4200 min −1   : 44,000   2       4200   100   60   Engine B: Power≈ 44,000 W, torque 260 N·m, time 1600 min −1   : 44,000   2       1600   260   60     This means, that increasing either torque or time will result in an increase in power. As the maximum rotational frequency of the diesel engines crankshaft is usually in between 3500...5000  min −1 due to diesel principle limitations, the torque of the diesel engine must be great to achieve a high power, or, in other words, as the diesel engine cannot use a lot of time for achieving a certain amount of power, it has to perform more work .         The average diesel engine has a poorer power-to-mass ratio than the  |Otto_engine|Otto_Engine| . This is because the diesel must operate at lower engine speeds. Due to the higher operating pressure inside the combustion chamber, which increases the forces on the parts due to inertial forces, the diesel engine needs heavier, stronger parts capable of resisting these forces, which results in an overall greater engine mass.            As diesel engines burn a mixture of fuel and air, the exhaust therefore contains substances that consist of the same  |chemical_elements|Chemical_Element| , as fuel and air. The main elements of air are  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  and  |oxygen|Oxygen|  , fuel consists of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and  |carbon|Carbon|  . Burning the fuel will result in the final stage of  |oxidation|Oxidation| . An ideal diesel engine, , running on an ideal air-fuel mixture, produces an exhaust that consists of  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide|  ,  |water|Water|  ,  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  , and the remaining  |oxygen|Oxygen|  . The combustion process in a real engine differs from an ideal engines combustion process, and due to incomplete combustion, the exhaust contains additional substances, most notably,  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide|  ,  |diesel_particulate_matter|Diesel_Particulate_Matter|  , and due to  |dissociation|Dissociation| ,  |nitrogen_oxide|Nitrogen_Oxide|  .     When diesel engines burn their fuel with high oxygen levels, this results in high combustion temperatures and higher efficiency, and particulate matter tends to burn, but the amount of  pollution tends to increase.  pollution can be reduced by recirculating a portion of an engines exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders, which reduces the oxygen quantity, causing a reduction of combustion temperature, and resulting in fewer . To further reduce  emissions,  |lean_traps_|Nox_Adsorber|  and  |SCR_catalysts|Selective_Catalytic_Reduction|  can be used. Lean  traps adsorb the nitrogen oxide and trap it. Once the LNT is full, it has to be regenerated using hydrocarbons. This is achieved by using a very rich air-fuel mixture, resulting in incomplete combustion. An SCR-catalyst converts nitrogen oxide using  |urea|Diesel_Exhaust_Fluid| , which is injected into the exhaust stream, and catalytically converts the  into nitrogen and water . Compared with an Otto engine, the diesel engine produces approximately the same amount of , but some older diesel engines may have an exhaust that contains up to 50% less . However, Otto engines, unlike diesel engines, can use a  |three_way_catalyst|Catalytic_Converterthree_Way| , that converts most of the .               The distinctive noise of a diesel engine is variably called diesel clatter, diesel nailing, or diesel knock. Diesel clatter is caused largely by the way the fuel ignites; the sudden ignition of the diesel fuel when injected into the combustion chamber causes a pressure wave, resulting in an audible ″knock″. Engine designers can reduce diesel clatter through: indirect injection; pilot or pre-injection; injection timing; injection rate; compression ratio; turbo boost; and  |exhaust_gas_recirculation|Exhaust_Gas_Recirculation|  . Common rail diesel injection systems permit multiple injection events as an aid to noise reduction. Therefore, newer diesel engines do not knock anymore. Diesel fuels with a higher cetane rating are more likely to ignite and hence reduce diesel clatter.         In general, diesel engines do not require any starting aid. In cold weather however, some diesel engines can be difficult to start and may need preheating depending on the combustion chamber design. The minimum starting temperature that allows starting without pre-heating is 40 °C for precombustion chamber engines, 20 °C for swirl chamber engines, and 0 °C for direct injected engines. Smaller engines with a displacement of less than 1  litre per cylinder usually have  |glowplugs|Glowplugs| , whilst larger heavy-duty engines have  |flame_start_systems|Flame_Start_System| .     In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as  |Detroit_Diesel|Detroit_Diesel|  engines used a system to introduce small amounts of  |ether|Diethyl_Ether|  into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Instead of glowplugs, some diesel engines are equipped with starting aid systems that change valve timing. The simplest way this can be done is with a decompression lever. Activating the decompression lever locks the outlet valves in a slight down position, resulting in the engine not having any compression and thus allowing for turning the crankshaft over without resistance. When the crankshaft reaches a higher speed, flipping the decompression lever back into its normal position will abruptly re-activate the outlet valves, resulting in compression − the flywheels  |mass_moment_of_inertia|Mass_Moment_Of_Inertia|  then starts the engine. Other diesel engines, such as the precombustion chamber engine XII Jv 170/240 made by Ganz & Co., have a valve timing changing system that is operated by adjusting the inlet valve camshaft, moving it into a slight late position. This will make the inlet valves open with a delay, forcing the inlet air to heat up when entering the combustion chamber.             As the diesel engine relies on manipulation of   for torque controlling and speed regulation, the intake air mass does not have to precisely match the injected fuel mass . diesel engines are thus ideally suited for supercharging and turbocharging. An additional advantage of the diesel engine is the lack of fuel during the compression stroke. In diesel engines, the fuel is injected near top dead centre , when the piston is near its highest position. The fuel then ignites due to compression heat. Preignition, caused by the artificial turbocharger compression increase during the compression stroke, cannot occur.     Many diesels are therefore  |turbocharged|Turbocharging|  and some are both turbocharged and  |supercharged|Supercharged| . A turbocharged engine can produce more power than a naturally aspirated engine of the same configuration. A supercharger is powered mechanically by the engines  |crankshaft|Crankshaft| , while a turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust. Turbocharging can improve the fuel economy of diesel engines by recovering waste heat from the exhaust, increasing the excess air factor, and increasing the ratio of engine output to friction losses. Adding an  |intercooler|Intercooler|  to a turbocharged engine further increases engine performance by cooling down the air-mass and thus allowing more air-mass per volume.     A  |two_stroke_engine|Two_Stroke_Engine|  does not have a discrete exhaust and intake stroke and thus is incapable of self-aspiration. Therefore, all two-stroke diesel engines must be fitted with a  |blower|Scavenge_Blower|  or some form of compressor to charge the cylinders with air and assist in dispersing exhaust gases, a process referred to as  |scavenging|Scavenging| . Roots-type superchargers were used for ship engines until the mid-1950s, since 1955 they have been widely replaced by turbochargers. Usually, a two-stroke ship diesel engine has a single-stage turbocharger with a turbine that has an axial inflow and a radial outflow.            In diesel engines, a mechanical injector system vaporises the fuel directly into the combustion chamber . This forced vaporisation means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher as there is no risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.          Therefore, diesel engines can operate on a huge variety of different fuels. In general, fuel for diesel engines should have a proper  |viscosity|Viscosity| , so that the  |injection_pump|Injection_Pump|  can pump the fuel to the injection nozzles without causing damage to itself or corrosion of the fuel line. At injection, the fuel should form a good fuel spray, and it should not have a coking effect upon the injection nozzles. To ensure proper engine starting and smooth operation, the fuel should be willing to ignite and hence not cause a high ignition delay, . Diesel fuel should also have a high  |lower_heating_value|Lower_Heating_Value| .     Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on fuels with a high ignition delay than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater swirl effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because  |lipid|Lipid|  depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low . Direct-injected engines with an MAN centre sphere combustion chamber rely on fuel condensing on the combustion chamber walls. The fuel starts vaporising only after ignition sets in, and it burns relatively smoothly. Therefore, such engines also tolerate fuels with poor ignition delay characteristics, and, in general, they can operate on petrol rated 86  |RON|Octane_Ratingresearch_Octane_Number| .         In his 1893 work  Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor , Rudolf Diesel considers using  |coal_dust|Coal_Dust|  as fuel for the diesel engine. However, Diesel just considered using coal dust ; his actual engine was designed to operate on  |petroleum|Petroleum| , which was soon replaced with regular  |petrol|Petrol|  and kerosine for further testing purposes, as petroleum proved to be too viscous. In addition to kerosine and petrol, Diesels engine could also operate on  |ligroin|Ligroin| .     Before diesel engine fuel was standardised, fuels such as  |petrol|Petrol| ,  |kerosine|Kerosine| ,  |gas_oil|Gas_Oil| ,  |vegetable_oil|Vegetable_Oil|  and  |mineral_oil|Lubricantmineral_Oil| , as well as mixtures of these fuels, were used. Typical fuels specifically intended to be used for diesel engines were  |petroleum_distillates|Petroleum_Distillate|  and  |coal_tar_distillates|Creosote|  such as the following; these fuels have specific lower heating values of:   Diesel oil: 10,200  kcal·kg −1 up to 10,250  kcal·kg −1   Heating oil: 10,000  kcal·kg −1 up to 10,200  kcal·kg −1   Coal-tar  |creosote|Creosote| |Kerosine|Kerosine| Source:     The first diesel fuel standards were the  |DIN_51601|Din_51601| ,  |VTL_9140_001|Vtl_9140_001| , and  |NATO_F_54|Nato_F_54| , which appeared after World War II. The modern European  |EN_590|En_590| |_diesel_fuel|Diesel_Fuel|  standard was established in May 1993; the modern version of the NATO F 54 standard is mostly identical with it. The DIN 51628 biodiesel standard was rendered obsolete by the 2009 version of the EN 590; FAME biodiesel conforms to the  |EN_14214|En_14214|  standard. Watercraft diesel engines usually operate on diesel engine fuel that conforms to the  |ISO_8217|Iso_8217|  standard . Also, some diesel engines can operate on  |gas|Gas| ses .                DIN 51601 diesel fuel was prone to waxing or gelling in cold weather; both are terms for the solidification of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state. The crystals build up in the fuel system , eventually starving the engine of fuel and causing it to stop running. Low-output electric heaters in  |fuel_tanks|Fuel_Tank|  and around fuel lines were used to solve this problem. Also, most engines have a spill return system, by which any excess fuel from the injector pump and injectors is returned to the fuel tank. Once the engine has warmed, returning warm fuel prevents waxing in the tank. Some manufacturers, such as BMW, recommended fuelling diesel cars with petrol to prevent the fuel from gelling when the temperatures dropped below −15 °C.             Diesel fuel is less  |flammable|Flammability|  than petrol, because its flash point is 55 °C, leading to a lower risk of fire caused by fuel in a vehicle equipped with a diesel engine.     Diesel fuel can create an explosive air/vapour mix under the right conditions. However, compared with petrol, it is less prone due to its lower  |vapour_pressure|Vapor_Pressure| , which is an indication of evaporation rate. The Material Safety Data Sheet for ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel indicates a vapour explosion hazard for diesel fuel indoors, outdoors, or in sewers.        |Diesel_exhaust|Diesel_Exhaust|  has been classified as an  |IARC_Group_1_carcinogen|List_Of_Iarc_Group_1_Carcinogens| . It causes  |lung_cancer|Lung_Cancer|  and is associated with an increased risk for  |bladder_cancer|Bladder_Cancer| .        See  |diesel_engine_runaway|Diesel_Engine_Runaway| .       The characteristics of diesel have different advantages for different applications.       Diesel engines have long been popular in bigger cars and have been used in smaller cars such as  |superminis|Supermini|  in Europe since the 1980s. They were popular in larger cars earlier, as the weight and cost penalties were less noticeable.  Smooth operation as well as high low end torque are deemed important for passenger cars and small commercial vehicles. The introduction of electronically controlled fuel injection significantly improved the smooth torque generation, and starting in the early 1990s, car manufacturers began offering their high-end luxury vehicles with diesel engines. Passenger car diesel engines usually have between three and ten cylinders, and a displacement ranging from 0.8 to 5.0 litres. Modern powerplants are usually turbocharged and have direct injection.     Diesel engines do not suffer from intake-air throttling, resulting in very low fuel consumption especially at low partial load . One fifth of all passenger cars worldwide have diesel engines, with many of them being in Europe, where approximately 47% of all passenger cars are diesel-powered.  |Daimler_Benz|Daimler_Benz|  in conjunction with  |Robert_Bosch_GmbH|Robert_Bosch_Gmbh|  produced diesel-powered passenger cars starting in 1936. The popularity of diesel-powered passenger cars in markets such as India, South Korea and Japan is increasing .            In 1893, Rudolf Diesel suggested that the diesel engine could possibly power ‘wagons’ . The first lorries with diesel engines were brought to market in 1924.     Modern diesel engines for lorries have to be both extremely reliable and very fuel efficient. Common-rail direct injection, turbocharging and four valves per cylinder are standard. Displacements range from 4.5 to 15.5 litres, with  |power_to_mass_ratios|Power_To_Weight_Ratio|  of 2.5–3.5  kg·kW −1 for heavy duty and 2.0–3.0  kg·kW −1 for medium duty engines.  |V6_and_V8_engines|V_Engine|  used to be common, due to the relatively low engine mass the V configuration provides. Recently, the V configuration has been abandoned in favour of straight engines. These engines are usually straight-6 for heavy and medium duties and straight-4 for medium duty. Their  |undersquare|Undersquare|  design causes lower overall piston speeds which results in increased lifespan of up to . Compared with 1970s diesel engines, the expected lifespan of modern lorry diesel engines has more than doubled.       Diesel engines for locomotives are built for continuous operation and may require the ability to use poor quality fuel in some circumstances. Some locomotives use two-stroke diesel engines. Diesel engines have eclipsed  |steam_engines|Steam_Engine|  as the prime mover on all non-electrified railroads in the industrialised world. The first  |diesel_locomotives|Diesel_Locomotive|  appeared in 1913, and  |diesel_multiple_units|Diesel_Multiple_Units|  soon after. Many modern diesel locomotives are actually  |diesel_electric_locomotives|Diesel_Electric_Locomotive| : the diesel engine is used to power an electric generator that in turn powers electric traction motors with no mechanical connection between diesel engine and traction. While  |electric_locomotives|Electric_Locomotive|  have replaced the  |diesel_locomotive|Diesel_Locomotive|  for some passenger traffic in Europe and Asia, diesel is still today very popular for cargo-hauling  |freight_trains|Freight_Train|  and on tracks where electrification is not feasible.     In the 1940s, road vehicle diesel engines with power outputs of 150...200  PS were considered reasonable for DMUs. Commonly, regular truck powerplants were used. The height of these engines had to be less than 1,000  mm to allow underfloor installation. Usually, the engine was mated with a pneumatically operated mechanical gearbox, due to the low size, mass, and production costs of this design. Some DMUs used hydraulic torque converters instead. Diesel-electric transmission was not suitable for such small engines. In the 1930s, the  |Deutsche_Reichsbahn|Deutsche_Reichsbahn|  standardised its first DMU engine. It was a 30.3 litre, 12-cylinder boxer unit, producing 275  PS . Several German manufacturers produced engines according to this standard.             The requirements for marine diesel engines vary, depending on the application. For military use and medium-size boats, medium-speed four-stroke diesel engines are most suitable. These engines usually have up to 24 cylinders and come with power outputs in the one-digit Megawatt region. Small boats may use lorry diesel engines. Large ships use extremely efficient, low-speed two-stroke diesel engines. They can reach efficiencies of up to 55%. Unlike most regular diesel engines, two-stroke watercraft engines use highly viscous  |fuel_oil|Fuel_Oil| . Submarines are usually diesel-electric.     The first diesel engines for ships were made by A. B. Diesels Motorer Stockholm in 1903. These engines were three-cylinder units of 120  PS and four-cylinder units of 180  PS and used for Russian ships. In World War I, especially submarine diesel engine development advanced quickly. By the end of the War, double acting piston two-stroke engines with up to 12,200  PS had been made for marine use.          Diesel engines had been used in aircraft before World War II, for instance, in the rigid airship  LZ 129 Hindenburg , which was powered by four  |Daimler_Benz_DB_602|Daimler_Benz_Db_602|  diesel engines, Kyrill von Gersdorff, Kurt Grasmann: Flugmotoren und Strahltriebwerke: Entwicklungsgeschichte der deutschen Luftfahrtantriebe von den Anfängen bis zu den internationalen Gemeinschaftsentwicklungen, Bernard & Graefe, 1985, , p. 14 or in several Junkers aircraft, which had  |Jumo_205|Junkers_Jumo_205|  engines installed. Until the late 1970s, there has not been any applications of the diesel engine in aircraft. In 1978, Karl H. Bergey argued that “the likelihood of a general aviation diesel in the near future is remote.” Karl H. Bergey: https://books.google.at/books?idav85AQAAMAAJ & printsecfrontcover & sourcegbsgesummaryr & cad0vonepage & q & ffalse Assessment of New Technology for General Aviation Aircraft, Report for U.S. Department of Transportation, September 1978, p. 19 In recent years , diesel engines have found use in unmanned aircraft , due to their reliability, durability, and low fuel consumption. Rik D Meininger et al.: Knock criteria for aviation diesel engines, International Journal of Engine Research, Vol 18, Issue 7, 2017,  In early 2019,  |AOPA|Aopa|  reported, that a diesel engine model for general aviation aircraft is “approaching the finish line.” AOPA: https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2019/january/23/eps-gives-certification-update-on-diesel-engine EPS gives certification update on diesel engine, 23 January 2019. Retrieved 1 November 2019.             |Non_road_diesel_engines|Non_Road_Engine|  are commonly used for  |construction_equipment|Construction_Equipment| . Fuel efficiency, reliability and ease of maintenance are very important for such engines, whilst high power output and quiet operation are negligible. Therefore, mechanically controlled fuel injection and air-cooling are still very common. The common power outputs of non-road diesel engines vary a lot, with the smallest units starting at 3  kW, and the most powerful engines being heavy duty lorry engines.            Stationary diesel engines are commonly used for electricity generation, but also for powering refrigerator compressors, or other types of compressors or pumps. Usually, these engines run permanently, either with mostly partial load, or intermittently, with full load. Stationary diesel engines powering electric generators that put out an alternating current, usually operate with alternating load, but fixed rotational frequency. This is due to the mains fixed frequency of either 50  Hz , or 60  Hz . The engines crankshaft rotational frequency is chosen so that the mains frequency is a multiple of it. For practical reasons, this results in crankshaft rotational frequencies of either 25  Hz or 30  Hz .       A special class of prototype internal combustion piston engines has been developed over several decades with the goal of improving efficiency by reducing heat loss. These engines are variously called adiabatic engines; due to better approximation of adiabatic expansion; low heat rejection engines, or high temperature engines. They are generally piston engines with combustion chamber parts lined with ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Some make use of pistons and other parts made of titanium which has a low thermal conductivity and density. Some designs are able to eliminate the use of a cooling system and associated parasitic losses altogether. Developing lubricants able to withstand the higher temperatures involved has been a major barrier to commercialization.         In mid-2010s literature, main development goals for future diesel engines are described as improvements of exhaust emissions, reduction of fuel consumption, and increase of lifespan . It is said that the diesel engine, especially the diesel engine for commercial vehicles, will remain the most important vehicle powerplant until the mid-2030s. Editors assume that the complexity of the diesel engine will increase further . Some editors expect a future convergency of diesel and Otto engines operating principles due to Otto engine development steps made towards  |homogeneous_charge_compression_ignition|Homogeneous_Charge_Compression_Ignition| .
