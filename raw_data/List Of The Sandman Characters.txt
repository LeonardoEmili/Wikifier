This is a list of characters appearing in The Sandman  comic book, published by  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics| |Vertigo|Vertigo_Comics| |imprint|Imprint| . This page discusses not only events which occur in The Sandman , but also some occurring in spinoffs of The Sandman  and in earlier stories that The Sandman was based on. These stories occur in the  |DC_Universe|Dc_Universe| , but are generally tangential to the mainstream DC stories.            The Endless are a family of seven  |anthropomorphic|Anthropomorphism|  personifications of universal concepts, around whom much of the series revolves. From eldest to youngest, they are:    Destiny   Death   Dream      Destruction     Desire   Despair   Delirium    All debuted in the Sandman series, except Destiny, who was created by  |Marv_Wolfman|Marv_Wolfman|  and  |Berni_Wrightson|Berni_Wrightson|  in  Weird Mystery Tales  1 .        These inhabitants of the  |Dreaming|The_Dreaming|  are often  |gods|God| ,  |myths|Myth| , and even ordinary human beings who later became dreams.            Cain and Abel are based on the Biblical  |Cain_and_Abel|Cain_And_Abel|  and adapted by editor  |Joe_Orlando|Joe_Orlando|  with  |Bob_Haney|Bob_Haney|  and  |Jack_Sparling|Jack_Sparling|  , and  |Mark_Hannerfeld|Mark_Hannerfeld|  and  |Bill_Draut|Bill_Draut|  . They were depicted together in Abels first appearance, and parted to their respective Houses at the end of the story. Although Cain would abuse Abel, he was not shown killing him until Swamp Thing vol. 2 33. In  Elvira s House of Mystery 11, Cain expresses shock at having killed his brother in recent times. In the same issue, a contest-winning letter establishes that Cain and the House exist both in the dream world and the real world, and that only in the dream world Cain continues to harm Abel. In The Sandman, Cain is shown to kill Abel quite often. In issue 2, Lucien calls this unusual, and recent.     ;Before The Sandman   Originally they were the respective hosts of the  |EC|Ec_Comics| -style  |horror|Horror_Fiction| |comic|Comic_Book|  anthologies  House of Mystery  and  House of Secrets , which ran from the 1950s through 1983—Cain debuting in House of Mystery 175 and Abel in DC Special 4 and House of Secrets 81 . During the 1970s, they also co-hosted the horror/humor anthology  Plop! . They were also both recurring characters in DCs Elviras House of Mystery .     In 1985, the characters were revived by writer  |Alan_Moore|Alan_Moore| , who introduced them into his  Swamp Thing  series in issue 33, retelling the Swamp Things original origin story from a 1971 issue of House of Secrets.  |Gary_Cohn|Gary_Cohn|  and  |Dan_Mishkin|Dan_Mishkin|  included them in the pages of  Blue Devil  in 1986.  |Jamie_Delano|Jamie_Delano|  also occasionally used them in a  |cameo_role|Cameo_Role|  in his title  Hellblazer .     ;In The Sandman   In Gaimans Sandman universe, the biblical  |Cain|Cain|  and  |Abel|Abel|  live in  |the_Dreaming|The_Dreaming|  at  |Dreams|Dream|  invitation. This is based on the verse in the Bible which says that Cain was sent to live in the  |Land_of_Nod|Land_Of_Nod| . They live as neighbors in two houses near a graveyard: Cain in the broad  |House_of_Mystery|House_Of_Mystery|  and Abel in the tall  |House_of_Secrets|House_Of_Secrets| . According to their appearance in Swamp Thing, the difference is that a mystery may be shared, but a secret must be forgotten if one tries to tell it.     Gaimans Cain is an aggressive, overbearing character. He is a thin, long-limbed man with an angular, drawn face, glasses, a tufty beard, and hair drawn into two points above his ears. He has been described by other characters as sounding just like  |Vincent_Price|Vincent_Price|  . e.g. by the raven  |Matthew|Matthew_Cable|  in Sandman 40, p9.     Gaimans Abel is a nervous, stammering, kind-hearted man; somewhat similar in appearance to Cain, with a tufty beard and hair that comes to points above his ears, though his hair is black rather than brown. He is shorter and fatter than Cain, with a more open face. It is eventually learned that the only time he does not stutter is when he is telling a story or when he is dead.     Cain frequently kills Abel in a brutal ways; whereupon Abel later returns to life, and frequently hopes for a more harmonious relationship between the two.     Cain and Abel own a large green draconic  |gargoyle|Gargoyle|  named  |Gregory|Minor_Dreams| , who also made his debut in House of Mystery 175. In the first appearance of the characters in Sandman, issue 2, Cain gives Abel an egg that soon hatches into another gargoyle, a small golden one. Abel names the gargoyle Irving . but Cain insists that the names of gargoyles must always begin with a G. , and Abel renames the gargoyle  |Goldie|Goldie|  , after an invisible/imaginary friend to whom Abel told his early House of Secrets stories. A letter in issue 91 was attributed to Goldie, who claimed that it was herself depicted on the cover of issue 88.     They shelter Dream until his strength is restored following his 72-year-long imprisonment. In the fourth  |story_arc|Story_Arc| ,  Season of Mists , Cain is sent to  |Hell|Hell|  to give a message to  |Lucifer|Lucifer|  because cain is protected by  |a_curse|Curse_And_Mark_Of_Cain|  that would deter lucifer from harming him. Cain and Abel also aid  |The_Corinthian|Corinthian|  with the child  |Daniel|Daniel_Hall|  during  The Kindly Ones , the penultimate story arc of the series. Abel is one of the victims of the  |Furies|Furies|  in this series, and is brought back to life by the new  |Dream|Daniel_Hall| .            The Corinthian is a nightmare created by  |Dream|Dream| , of human appearance but with two small additional mouths in place of his eyes. He enjoys eating the eyeballs of people he kills.   The first version of the Corinthian is destroyed by Dream for spending several unsupervised decades on Earth as a serial killer , and it is shown in  The Sandman: Overture  that Dream intended to do this before his imprisonment. Near the end of the series Dream creates a second Corinthian, altering his personality to be obedient and useful rather than homicidal. In a later story in The Dreaming, the second Corinthian is haunted by the actions of the first.       Eve is based on the biblical  |Eve|Adam_And_Eve| , the mother of humanity and wife of Adam.     Eve originally appeared in  Secrets of Sinister House  6  ; she was the series principal host, often in stock images, usually with her raven. After issue 15, in which Eve reveals in the letter column that her raven, Edgar Allen , is an enchanted deceased human, editor  |Joe_Orlando|Joe_Orlando|  departed from the series and so did she, the series focusing on sinister house s. Secrets of Sinister House 16 That month , she started hosting one story per month in  Weird Mystery Tales .     She became the principal host of Weird Mystery Tales with issue 15,  |Destiny|Destiny|  having moved to  Secrets of Haunted House  as principal host. In  Plop! , Eve, Cain, and Abel each tell one story per issue. She also makes a few appearances in  House of Mystery  and  House of Secrets . In her early appearances, she appears only as a  |crone|Crone| , is often identified as a witch, and has a tendency to sharp speech. In her first appearance, she scares Cain and Abel, and shouts at them, Get out of the kitchen when it gets too hot, you cowardly mortals! Old Eve doesnt care... Her letter column, which was answered in character, was called Witchs Tales . She appeared as a principal character in stories in Secrets of Sinister House 9 and 11 and Weird Mystery Tales 18. In issue 9, she stays in an apartment building under an assumed name , where the smell of her cooking causes her neighbor to report her to the superintendent, so she curses the neighbor to repeat a day—which begins wonderfully and ends in two deaths—over and over again.     In Weird Mystery Tales 3 , Destiny insisted that Eve, Cain, and Abel are not their Biblical eponyms. When she is shown in Sandman 2, Luciens comment about her addresses her unfriendly nature prior to Dreams return, stating that she confines herself to nightmares.     Eve lives in a cave in the Dreaming, and is often accompanied by Dreams raven. The first raven, Lucien, taught her how to bury Abel after Cain murdered him and she has been accompanied by a raven ever since. She is kind and has a maternal nature, though she retains her sharp language. Most of the time she appears as a black-haired woman of indeterminate age; but sometimes appears a young, attractive maiden, a middle-aged mother, or an elderly crone. When we first see her in The Sandman 2, she looks little different from her original appearances. Next, in, 24, she has put on much weight, has a friendlier face, and shows her ability to de-age as she embraces Matthew. Her largest appearance is in 40, wherein she appears young and beautiful for the first time.        |Fiddlers_Green|Fiddlers_Green|  is a place in the Dreaming which all travellers dream of someday finding, which sometimes assumes human form and goes wandering, under the alias Gilbert; a kindly, portly man who, in appearance and behavior, resembles  |G._K._Chesterton|G._K._Chesterton| . As Gilbert, Fiddlers Green accompanied  |Rose_Walker|Rose_Walker|  to find her brother Jed, and gave her the means by which to summon Dream to rescue her from danger; and thereafter returned to the Dreaming. He was killed by the Three in  The Kindly Ones , and himself refused resurrection by the  |new_Dream|Daniel_Hall| . Here, it is implied that he was in love, a little with Rose.       A  |wyvern|Wyvern| , a  |griffin|Griffin|  and a  |hippogriff|Hippogriff|  are the guardians of Dreams castle. The hippogriff has a horses head instead of the traditional eagles head.   They derive all their power and authority from Dream, so when Dream was captured and lost his power, they could no longer guard or protect the Dreaming.     After the griffin was destroyed by the Furies, the new Dream did not remake him, but asked the gryphons of Greek myth to send one of their own.       A large green gargoyle, the pet of Cain. Gregory communicates in grunts which inhabitants of the Dreaming appear to understand. He helps Goldie re-assemble Abel when Cain kills him. He first appeared as the child of two stone gargoyles in  House of Mystery  175, wherein his parents perched on the House of Mystery until they were able to kill their sculptor, a boarder in the house who had murdered their designer, and left without their egg. He later appears during the  Blackest Night  crossover, defending  |Scandal_Savage|Scandal_Savage| , the new owner of the House of Mystery, from members of the  |Suicide_Squad|Suicide_Squad| .          Goldie is Abels pet gargoyle.     ;In The Sandman   Goldie is a pet  |gargoyle|Gargoyle| , given to  |Abel|Cain_And_Abel|  by his brother  |Cain|Cain_And_Abel|  in  Sandman 2 . Abel originally intended to name him Irving , but Cain insisted that gargoyles names must all begin with a G. Cain then proceeded to murder Abel over this, after which Abel names the gargoyle Goldie, after a friend who went away .     ;After The Sandman   Goldie takes centre stage in  The Dreaming , a Sandman spin-off series not written by Gaiman. In The Goldie Factor, Goldie leaves the Dreaming and ends up in the Garden of Eden.       Lucien is the chief librarian in  |The_Dreaming|The_Dreaming| , and is a tall thin, bookish man. He first appeared in  Weird Mystery Tales  18 and was apparently killed in  Secrets of Haunted House  44 .     Like  |Cain_and_Abel|Cain_And_Abel| , Lucien, created by  |Paul_Levitz|Paul_Levitz| ,  |Nestor_Redondo|Nestor_Redondo| , and  |Joe_Orlando|Joe_Orlando| , was originally the host of a 1970s weird tales comic, specifically the three-issue  Tales of Ghost Castle  . In that series, he is portrayed as the guardian of a castle in  |Transylvania|Transylvania|  abandoned by both sides during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| ,   watching over its forgotten library with his companion, a  |werewolf|Werewolf|  named Rover. In his first appearance in  Preludes and Nocturnes  this is  |retroactively|Retcon|  revealed to be Dreams castle.     Lucien is the effective keeper of the Dreaming in Dreams absence, and becomes one of Dreams most faithful and trusted servants after proving his loyalty by never abandoning his post during that period. His primary function is to protect the Library, wherein are contained all the books that have ever been dreamed of, including the ones that have never been written. The  |titles_of_some_of_these_books|List_Of_Fictional_Books_From_Periodicalsdc_Comics| , many of which are sequels to real works, are visible. He is, despite his frail appearance, apparently quite capable in combat, with several unpleasant creatures who escape imprisonment during the events of The Kindly Ones.     In issue 68, it is revealed that Luciens existence in the Dreaming began as serving the role of Dreams first  |raven|Raven| . When writing  The Sandman Companion , author Hy Bender interpreted this as meaning that Lucien was also  |the_first_man|Adam| . An allusion to Mr. Raven , the ghostly librarian in  |George_MacDonalds|George_Macdonald|  novel  Lilith , may be intended.            Matthew is the  |raven|Raven|  companion of  |Dream|Dream|  of  |the_Endless|Endless| .     Matthew was originally Matthew Cable, a long-time supporting character in the  Swamp Thing  series, but because he died while asleep in the Dreaming, he was offered the chance to become a dream raven and serve Dream if he wished, and he accepted.     Matthew is not the first of Morpheus ravens. Former ravens include  |Aristeas|Aristeas|  of  |Marmora|Marmara_Island| , who returned to his life as a man for one year at one point, and  |Lucien|Lucien| , the first of the ravens. Morpheus seems to keep the ravens around out of some sort of unspoken need for companionship, though he also sends them on occasional missions.     Matthews  |word_balloons|Speech_Balloon|  and  |font_style|Letterer|  are scratchy and uneven, probably to represent a hoarse, cawing voice, and perhaps as an indicator of his crude, smart-aleck personality. Underneath his frequently irreverent manner, Matthew is actually very loyal to Dream, and he is one of the characters who takes it the hardest when Dream perishes, initially seeking release from his service, but eventually coming to terms with his loss and choosing to remain as  |Daniels|Daniel_Hall|  raven.            Mervyn Pumpkinhead is Dreams cantankerous, cigar-smoking janitor: an animated  |scarecrow|Scarecrow|  whose head is a  |jack-o-lantern|Jack-O-Lantern| . He resembles  |Jack_Pumpkinhead|Jack_Pumpkinhead|  of  |L._Frank_Baums|L._Frank_Baum| |Oz|Land_Of_Oz|  books.     Mervyn is first seen in  Preludes and Nocturnes  when Dream travels on a bus. Thereafter Merv is in charge of the construction, maintenance, and demolition work in  |the_Dreaming|The_Dreaming| , though he sometimes complains that his job is superfluous because Dream can change any of the Dreaming at will. One issue of the Dreaming spin-off comic focuses on a dreamer who enjoys working under Mervs supervision.     Mervyn was one of the few who took arms against the Furies in  The Kindly Ones ; but is easily killed. He is returned to life by the  |new_Dream|Daniel_Hall|  in  The Wake .     In a past incarnation shown in  The Wake , Mervyn was seen to have had a  |turnip|Turnip|  for a head instead of a pumpkin, as pumpkins were not then known in Europe.       Brute and Glob |Jack_Kirbys|Jack_Kirby|  1974  Sandman  series, as sidekicks to the title character, and continued as such when  |Hector_Hall|Hector_Hall|  became the Sandman in  Infinity Inc. . In the original comics, Brute was similar to  |The_Thing|Thing| , shouted Its clobberin time! and often referred to his Uncle Harry. In  The Dolls House , it is revealed that they controlled the Sandmen in secret; whereupon Dream exiled them to the darkness . Near the end of  The Kindly Ones , the Furies tell Dream that they have released his prisoners from the darkness, but Brute and Glob are neither mentioned nor seen in this volume or in  The Wake . They next appear in The Dreaming 57–60, The Sandman Presents: Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Dreams...But Were Afraid to Ask, and  Lucifer  15, where they attempt to kidnap  |Elaine_Belloc|Elaine_Belloc| . They subsequently reappear in  JSA  64, again trying to manipulate a human connected to the Dreaming  into their own Sandman ; but Daniel, Dreams heir, returns them to the darkness. The two entities claim this area of darkness is filled with pleasing childhood dreams, which they despise. First appearance: The Sandman vol. 1, 1.   The CuckooA Game of You . She assumes the form of a childhood version of Barbie and uses her self proclaimed adorableness to escape from Barbies dream world, at which point she transforms into a bird.   The Fashion Thing |The_Mad_Mod_Witch|The_Mad_Mod_Witch| , created by  |Dave_Wood|Dave_Wood|  and  |Jack_Sparling|Jack_Sparling|  as the host of  The Unexpected , another DC horror title. At the time of her first appearance in Sandman, she is a Mad  |Yuppie|Yuppie|  Witch . First appearance: The Unexpected 108. Most of her appearances are relegated to a few panels. She is shown flying on her broom as a Yuppie briefly in issue 2, shown riding her broom in a top hat and tails with bare legs and feet in issue 22, and shown  |topless|Toplessness|  serving a meal to Delirium and Dream in issue 42. She also appears in The Kindly Ones.   Judge Gallows appears in several issues of The Dreaming including the Special, Trial and Error . Introduced in  The Unexpected  113 , he is one of the few DC mystery hosts not used by Gaiman.           Bast, in  |Neil_Gaimans|Neil_Gaiman|  comic book series  The Sandman , is the  |DC_Universe|Dc_Universe|  version of the goddess  |Bast|Bast|  of  |Egyptian_mythology|Egyptian_Mythology| . She was once a major goddess, but the loss of her believers over time has significantly reduced her powers. She is often coquettish toward  |Dream|Dream| , who sometimes goes to her for advice or companionship; but she has often claimed never to have been his lover. Bast has also appeared in issues of  Wonder Woman  and  Hawkgirl , wherein she is one of the chief goddesses worshiped by the Amazons of  |Bana-Mighdall|Bana-Mighdall| . She appears in Sandman Presents: Bast: Eternity Game , where she attempts to regain her lost power.          The Presence is the Sandman universes equivalent of a  |Supreme_Being|Supreme_Being| , and he shares many characteristics with the standard Abrahamic God, such as almost never taking a physical form, being a  |Creator_deity|Creator_Deity| , and having unmatched power. Nevertheless, Gaiman has on several occasions stated that he never intended the Creator to be any specific religions god, just as he makes it clear in the first appearance of the abode of the angels, the  |Silver_City|Silver_City| , that it is not  |Paradise|Paradise| . It is not  |Heaven|Heaven| . It is the Silver City, that is not part of the order of created things , although the Silver City is often identified as Heaven in the  Lucifer  comic book series.     In that series, one of the critical turning points is the Presences abandonment of his Creation, which leads to a large number of problems, including struggles to claim the power that the Creator has abandoned, to make the destruction of the universe inevitable and to the slow unraveling of the universe due to the disappearance of the Name of the Creator written on every atom in existence. This is an ongoing storyline in Lucifer.       Loki is a  |trickster|Trickster|  god seen in  Season of Mists ; based on the  |Norse_god|Norse_Mythology| |Loki|Loki| . In his own form, Loki is a tall, thin man with yellow eyes and long red hair that resembles flames; but he is capable of assuming any appearance at will. He is sometimes nicknamed Lie-Smith and Sky-walker by other characters.     ;In The Sandman   He is temporarily freed from his punishment by  |Odin|Odin|  to accompany his negotiations for the rulership of Hell; whereafter he deceives Odin and Thor into imprisoning another god in his place, but fails to fool Dream, who frees the other god and sends a simulacrum of Loki to take his punishment, in exchange for Lokis debt to himself. Loki returns in  The Kindly Ones , wherein he works with Puck to kidnap Daniel, a child under Dreams protection. The Corinthian and Matthew eventually find Daniel, and Loki attempts to fool them by taking the form of Dream; but the Corinthian strangles Loki and consumes his eyes. Loki, now blind, is taken by Odin and Thor back to his punishment.     ;After The Sandman   Loki reappears in  Lucifer , wherein Lucifer comes to Loki to take his ship for his own universe, and destroys the snake that tortures Loki, who therefore allows him the ship.       Odin, as based on the  |Norse_God|Norse_Mythology| |Odin|Odin| , appears as an old man wearing a wide-brimmed hat and cloak and carrying a staff. He is usually depicted as a dark, mysterious figure, missing one eye and accompanied by two ravens,  |Hugin_and_Munin|Hugin_And_Munin|  , and two wolves,  |Geri_and_Freki|Geri_And_Freki| .       The Three appear in the form of any group of three women; usually the Mother, the  Maiden  and the  Crone , the three aspects of the  |Triple_Goddess|Triple_Deity|  in many mythologies. Sometimes they appear in the form of the three witches from DCs horror anthology,  The Witching Hour  |prestige_format|Prestige_Format|  limited series of the same title, and two standard limited series, Witchcraft and Witchcraft: Le Terreur.     ;In The Sandman   The Three repeatedly appear throughout The Sandman, fulfilling different functions at different points in the story. Their first appearance is in The Sandman 2, where they appear as the three witches, Mildred , Mordred , and Cynthia from the  |DC|Dc_Comics|  horror anthology  The Witching Hour . They later take many different forms over the course of the series, and the three women symbol remains an extremely common one, often blurring the lines between when characters are supposed to be merely themselves and when they are supposed to be representations of the Three. The Three represent the female principle, prophecy, and mystery, and they are often a vaguely menacing and enigmatic presence in the series. Incarnations of the Three include the  |Erinyes|Erinyes|  in their vengeful aspect and the  |Moirai|Moirai|  or  |Weird_Sisters|Weird_Sisters|  in their divinatory aspect. They also sometimes subtly appear in the form of other characters  or groups of characters.     ;After The Sandman   The Three later appeared in a graphic novel named WitchCraft, in which one of their priestesses in ancient Rome, Ursula, is raped by barbarians. She is then reincarnated three times, followed by the witches, and wronged again by reincarnations of the barbarian leader until the modern age, when she comes back as his elderly mother-in-law and manages to defeat him.     The Three then assure that he would be reincarnated as each of the priestesses he had raped, in order, with the exception of Ursula. He would never know what was happening until the moment of death, at which point it would start all over again.     The Three are satisfied, and in the end decide that Ursula will live another twenty years and become an accomplished and respected witch in her twilight years, and her grandchild will be beautiful.       Ishtar |Ishtar|Ishtar| , disguised as an exotic dancer; a former lover of  |Destruction|Destruction| .   Pharamond |Dream|Dream| . At Dreams suggestion that he change with the times or fade like many other gods, Pharamond now runs a  |travel_agency|Travel_Agency|  in Dublin, under the  |alias|Pseudonym|  Mr Farell. He helps  |Dream|Dream|  and  |Delirium|Delirium|  find the missing Destruction, and later provided assistance to Lucifer in his own series.   Thor |Thor|Thor|  first appeared in DC Comics in Tales of the Unexpected 16 , The Magic Hammer, illustrated by  |Jack_Kirby|Jack_Kirby| . In another story attributed to Kirby and  |George_Papp|George_Papp| , The Magic Stick in House of Mystery 68 , he looked like a traditional Viking with red hair, and his hammer looked identical to the way Kirby would draw it for  |Marvel_Comics|Thor| . That story was reprinted in DC Special 4 , which also contains Abels debut. There is a story from Tales of the Unexpected 16 in DC Special 4, but it is not the Thor story. Kirby also pitted Wesley Dodds against someone claiming to be Thor in  Adventure Comics  75 . Later, a museum worker handled Thors hammer and briefly became Thor in Batman 127 . Thor also appears in  War of the Gods  and  Jack Kirbys Fourth World .            Azazel is a former ruler of Hell, reigning for a time alongside  |Lucifer|Lucifer|  and  |Beelzebub|Beelzebub| . Based on a statement from Agony and Ecstasy in  Hellblazer  12, he may have usurped his position from  |Belial|Belial|  . He appears as a ragged opening into darkness, full of disembodied eyes and mouths. He was cast out after Lucifer abandoned Hell, and later imprisoned by Dream in a glassjar. He reappears, still in Dreams glassjar, in  Lucifer Volume 2  .     He is based on the demon  |Azazel|Azazel| .     Azazel first appeared in DC Comics battling  |Madame_Xanadu|Madame_Xanadu|  in the story intended for Doorway to Nightmare 6 that was eventually published in  Cancelled Comic Cavalcade  2 and  The Unexpected  190. As with Lucifers appearance in The Brave and the Bold, he looked more like a traditional devil, but was identified as an  |incubus|Incubus| |Beelzebub|Beelzebub|  was the third King of Hell. He often appears as either a gigantic green fly, or a flys head on two short human legs. Sometimes a human face can be seen between the flys eyes. His constant buzzing slurs his speech He is based on the demon  |Beelzebub|Beelzebub| .       Choronzon is a former duke of Hell who served under  |Beelzebub|Beelzebub| . He has pink skin and two mouths, one under the other.     He had possession of Dreams helm, but lost it in a challenge. He later reappeared briefly as one of  |Azazels|Azazel|  tactics to gain ownership of Hell.     He is based on the demon  |Choronzon|Choronzon| .     Choronzon appears in  52  25 .            Duma is a  |fallen_angel|Fallen_Angel|  from the  |DC|Dc_Comics| |Vertigo|Vertigo_Comics|  series  The Sandman .     ;Before The Sandman   Dumas name means silence , and he is based on the angel  |Duma|Dumah|  from  |Jewish_mythology|Jewish_Mythology| .     ;In The Sandman   In  Season of Mists , we find that  |Lucifer|Lucifer|  has closed down Hell in frustration, and given the key to  |Dream|Dream| . Eventually, after much squabbling between various  |gods|List_Of_Deities| , Duma and  |Remiel|Remiel|  are assigned to assume control of Hell, and Duma accepts this.     ;After The Sandman   Following the end of The Sandman series, Remiel and Duma lose ownership of Hell in the Lucifer spin-off series. Duma eventually allies with Lucifer and Elaine Belloc to save creation, and persuades Hells new ruler Christopher Rudd to bring his army to Heavens aid at the Battle of  |Armageddon|Armageddon| .            Lucifer is the sometime ruler of Hell, and a  |fallen_angel|Fallen_Angel| . He is based on the fallen angel  |Lucifer|Lucifer| , whose story was created by  |John_Milton|John_Milton|  in his epic poem  Paradise Lost .  Neil Gaiman also used the character Lucifer in his short story Murder Mysteries, wherein he was a captain in the Silver City, with  |Azazel|Azazel|  as his protégé.     In the book Hanging out with the Dream King , one of Gaimans artists, Kelley Jones, states that Lucifers appearance is based on that of  |David_Bowie|David_Bowie| must draw David Bowie. Find David Bowie, or Ill send you David Bowie. Because if it isnt David Bowie, youre going to have to redo it until it is David Bowie. So I said, Okay, its David Bowie....     Lucifer made at least three previous appearances in DC Comics , but his appearance was more traditional. Lucifer as he appeared in The Sandman also appeared in issues of the series  The Demon  and  The Spectre  and in the miniseries  Stanley and His Monster  .            Mazikeen is a fictional character from  |Neil_Gaimans|Neil_Gaiman|   Sandman   |mythos|Mythology| . The name  |Mazikeen|Mazikeen|  comes from that of a shapeshifting demon of  |Jewish_mythology|Jewish_Mythology| .     ;In The Sandman   Mazikeen first appeared in The Sandman, where she was  |Lucifers|Lucifer|  consort while he reigned in Hell. At the time, half of her face was normal, but the other half was horribly misshapen and skeletal, causing her speech to be nearly unintelligible.     When Lucifer resigned, Mazikeen left Hell and ended up following her master, becoming part of the staff at the Lux , an elite Los Angeles bar that Lucifer had opened and played piano at. To conceal her demonic nature, she covered the deformed half of her face with a white mask and rarely spoke.     ;After The Sandman   In the ongoing comic book series  Lucifer , Mazikeen is a devoted ally of Lucifer Morningstar and the war leader of the  |Lilin|Lilin| , a race descended from  |Lilith|Lilith| . A fearsome warrior and a respected leader, Mazikeen is a prominent character in the Lucifer comics. She has the appearance of a human female with long black hair.     In Lucifer, Mazikeens face was turned fully human when she was resuscitated by the  |Basanos|Basanos|  following the destruction of the Lux in a fire. This was because the vessel of the Basanos, Jill Presto, did not realize that Mazikeens face was naturally deformed, and assumed that it was burned in the fire.     When Lucifer refused to assist her in restoring her face to its former state, she defected to her family, the Lilim-in-Exile. As their war leader, she led their army against Lucifers cosmos, allying herself briefly with the Basanos. However, this was a ruse; after a desperate gamble, she bought Lucifer enough time to destroy the Basanos and regain control of his creation.

Inhabitants of  |Faerie|Faerie| .       The Cluracan is a courtier of the Queen of Faerie and the brother to  |Nuala|Nuala| , the Dream Kings fairy servant. An amoral, merry, capricious, homosexual rogue, Cluracan features in  Season of Mists ,  Worlds End ,  The Kindly Ones , and  The Wake . He is strongly reminiscent of the  |trickster|Trickster|  archetype also associated with  |Loki|Loki| . Following the events of  The Kindly Ones , Cluracan offends his queen so badly that she sends him to the court of Llinor, where tradition demands that he marry a lady of the royal house; whereupon Cluracans  |nemesis|Archenemy|   – identical to him in every way except his sexual orientation  – takes Cluracans place.

In the latter series, it is revealed that she was a human girl who crossed over into the fay realm and was then adopted by the previous queen of the fay, and received her faerie powers from a circlet seized by her from that queen. Despite this power, it was revealed that she is  |illiterate|Literacy| , and so regularly uses Dreams library because its special properties allow its users to read books in any language, including those they cannot speak. There are suggestions that she may be the mother of the series protagonist,  |Timothy_Hunter|Timothy_Hunter| .

Robert Hob Gadling is a human granted immortality, who meets with  |Dream|Dream|  once every hundred years.     Hob was granted immortality in a pub named the White Horse in 1389 when he simply declared that he had decided never to die ; whereupon Death agrees, at Dreams request, to forgo him. Hob thereupon takes to a variety of occupations over the centuries, including slaving, and periodically reinvents himself as a descendant of his previous persona. Gradually, he acquires a conscience, and by the 20th Century has become full of remorse at his past deeds. Dream converses with Gadling once per century, of Gadlings latest occupations. At their 20th Century meeting, Dream admits that the purpose of the exercise was simply for him to have a friend. In  The Wake , Death offers to end his six-hundred-year life; but Gadling declines.       Orpheus is the son of  |Dream|Dream|  and the muse Calliope. He is based on  |Orpheus|Orpheus|  of  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| .     In  |The_Song_of_Orpheus|The_Sandman:_Fables_And_Reflections_The_Song_Of_Orpheus|  , the Endless attend Orpheuss wedding to Eurydice. Eurydice dies on the same night, and Orpheus asks his father retrieve her from  |Hades|Hades| . Dream refuses, but Orpheus gets help from Destruction and Death.

Thessaly is the last of the millennia-old witches of Thessaly. She makes her first appearance in  A Game of You . She has a bookish appearance with straight hair and thick glasses that belie her personality: amoral, cold-blooded, proud, and ruthless, though not malicious. She will kill people who are potential threats with no hesitation or remorse.      |Neil_Gaiman|Neil_Gaiman|  named this character after the land of witches,  |Thessaly|Thessaly| , in  |Greece|Greece| . In one of Platos dialogues, the Gorgias, Socrates states I would not have us risk that which is dearest on the acquisition of this power, like the Thessalian enchantresses, who, as they say, bring down the moon from heaven at the risk of their own perdition. In the series, Thessaly does exactly that, with deadly consequences, just as Socrates predicts. Later in the series, Thessaly changes her name to  |Larissa|Larissa| , which is the capital of Thessaly. Larissa was actually the local fountain nymph, after whom the town was named. It is suggested however that Thessaly is even older than this civilization and may date from Neolithic times.     Thessaly returns in the later volumes, where she is Dreams lover for a time, but this relationship ends unhappily for both and is never actually shown in the series. When it is alluded to in  Brief Lives  Thessaly is never mentioned by name, so only in  The Kindly Ones  is this romance revealed. Also in The Kindly Ones, Thessaly provides  |Lyta_Hall|Fury|  with protection and sanctuary from  |Dream|Dream|  while he is being targeted for death by the Furies, who are using Hall as a vessel.     In  The Wake  she attends Dreams wake and funeral. She speaks with two of Dreams lovers and recalls her relationship with Dream. She remarks that part of his attraction to her was that she was not intimidated by him. To her surprise she later would dream of Morpheus, and the two kindled a romance, with Dream madly in love with Thessaly . When Morpheus ended his courtship and resumed working Thessaly realized she did not love Morpheus and left the Dreaming.     When Lyta wakes up after Dreams death, Thessaly calmly advises her to leave. Thessaly suggests that many people, including herself, would be more than happy to murder Lyta for her part in Morpheus destruction.     Thessaly also is the star of two spin-off comic series, The Thessaliad and Thessaly, Witch for Hire written by  |Bill_Willingham|Bill_Willingham| . In the spin-offs, Thessaly and her companion, a ghost named Fetch, first set out to tackle various gods of the underworld who want her dead. Later she is unwillingly pressured into a monster-killing contract.     She is alluded to in the  |Faction_Paradox|Faction_Paradox|  series, in the character Thessalia and her protégé Larissa.         A London tramp born in 1741. At the time of Sandman 3, she was 247 years old. She appears frequently in other DC comics such as Hellblazer, first appearing in 9. She also had a large role in Death: The High Cost of Living, where she is shown to be rude, miserly and constantly complains about the lack of knowledge that present day youths have. She has been accused of being a witch, and also appears to have abilities as a  |haruspex|Haruspex| , however she merely states that you dont get to your two hundred and fiftieth without learning a few tricks .      Later, Hettie worked in the series The Dreaming, in which it was discovered that she had dealings with  |Destiny|Destiny| ,  |Johanna_Constantine|Johanna_Constantine|  and President  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| .     In The Sandman: Overture, it is revealed that she had stolen a magical timepiece in her youth, which remained hidden in her memories until Daniel retrieved it.       Appearing for the first time in  Lucifer: Nirvana , The Silk Man is an immortal sorcerer, described by  |Lucifer|Lucifer|  as  ..a fossil remnant from an earlier, cruder creation. His body is a weaving that has to be renewed constantly. His spirit too, come to that. A messy form of immortality, but it seems to do the job.  In earlier days he was the leader of the  |Arao_Jinn|Arao_Jinn| . He appears as a mercenary, hired by the angel Perdissa to kill Lucifer. He seems to need to consume living things to stay alive, weaving them into himself. He is severely damaged by Perdissa and eventually killed by Lucifer.       In  |The_Hunt|The_Sandman:_Fables_And_Reflections| , Vassily appears as an old man telling his teen-aged granddaughter a tale from the old country , medieval Russia. A youth raised in a remote forest has a series of adventures, including meeting with Lucien and  |Baba_Yaga|Baba_Yaga| , and marrying a fellow shape-changing wolf. At the end of the story, it is revealed that the grandfather is the youth in his own story.           Alex Burgess is the son of Roderick Burgess, mother unknown . He is taught by his father, and takes part in his rituals. Upon Roderick Burgess death, Alex inherits his estate, including his magical order. He keeps Dream imprisoned, as his father did, trying to bargain for power and immortality in exchange for Dreams release.     The Order of the Ancient Mysteries enjoys a resurgence in popularity in the 1960s, but by the 1970s it is in decline again. Alex passes ownership of the Order on to his boyfriend, Paul McGuire, and becomes obsessed with his prisoner and with his father. Finally, in 1988, Dream escapes and puts Alex into a nightmare of eternal waking, in which he is forever dreaming he is waking up, and each waking degenerates into another horrible nightmare. This nightmare lasts for years, ending only with Dreams death in  The Kindly Ones .     Alex is quite tall and near-sighted. He has brown hair which he wears in a variety of styles throughout his life, but by old age he is bald and has come to resemble his father very closely. His relationship with McGuire is deep and heartfelt, but his obsessions with his father and with Dream eventually come to rule his life. In  The Wake , he appears again as the child that we see in his first appearance.     Alex is in many ways a tragic figure, perhaps the first statement of the theme that  |Desire|Desire|  explores in  The Wake  : The bonds of family bind both ways . Had Alex not been born the son of his father, inheriting the imprisoned Dream, his life might have been much happier. However, he is finally able to find some measure of fulfillment in his old age, following Dreams death.     His name almost certainly derives from  |Anthony_Burgesss|Anthony_Burgess|   A Clockwork Orange , the protagonist of which is named Alex, but could also be a nod to  |Aleister_Crowley|Aleister_Crowley| , whose original middle name was Alexander and who was mentioned in the first issue.       Roderick Burgess was the Lord Magus of The Order of the Ancient Mysteries. Born Morris Burgess Brocklesby and known also as The Daemon King, his magical fraternity was based in Fawney Rig in  |Sussex|Sussex| , and was initially funded by his inherited industrial wealth. Burgess is a magician rather in the vein of the real  |Aleister_Crowley|Aleister_Crowley| , and within the  |DC_world|Dc_Universe|  is Crowleys rival.     The series begins with Burgess attempt to capture and bind  |Death|Death| , which fails, capturing  |Dream|Dream|  instead. Burgess keeps Dream trapped in a glass globe for the rest of his life, attempting to bargain with Dream, but Dream remains silent. Burgess dies from a heart attack still attempting to get a response out of Dream. His order passes the globe and Dream to his son Alex.     Burgess is a bald-headed, slightly pot-bellied man with a large hook nose. He is ultimately self-centred; his sole purpose for the Order is to bring money and power to himself, and he is consumed by his desire to achieve immortality. His relationship with his son is only briefly touched on, though it is implied that it is unhealthy, with Burgess pushing his son to spend his life pursuing his fathers dreams.       Lady Johanna Constantine is an 18th-century supernatural adventuress.  |Dream|Dream|  encounters her several times, once to ask her to recover the head of his son,  |Orpheus|Orpheus|   – a mission she performed so successfully that part of its aftereffects was the ending of the French Revolutions Reign of Terror. The Sandman 29     In the Hellblazer Special: Lady Constantine graphic novel, an ancient evil refers to Johanna Constantine as the Constantine, the laughing magician, and the constant one, all titles that have been used to describe  |John_Constantine|John_Constantine| . The evil taunts her, saying did you think to trick us with a new form? There is the implication that throughout all times there have been recurring incarnations of Constantine who contain the spark of magic.  In the story Johanna Constantine learns that the  |Devil|Devil|  and the  |Wandering_Jew|Wandering_Jew|  meet once every hundred years in a London pub; this meeting is actually between  |Dream|Dream|  and  |Hob_Gadling|Hob_Gadling| , as she discovers when she interrupts the meeting. The Sandman 13 The storys conclusion shows Johanna Constantine inheriting a property she calls Fawney Rig , after the con job wherein a gilded ring is sold as though it were solid gold... the implication being that she attained the property through trickery. This property was later owned by Roderick Burgess, the mage who captured Dream in the beginning of The Sandman story.     ;After The Sandman   In her middle age, Johanna Constantine is charged by persons unknown with the key to a box containing the sigil of America, allegedly created by Destiny. The Dreaming 4–7 This is stolen and hidden in the future by the wanderer, Mad Hettie. Hettie both blackmails and bribes Johanna for her silence, promising her that she would live to age 99. This promise proves true, with Johanna dying at age 99 while getting out of her wheelchair when she hears the song of her old companion, Orpheus.     Johanna is an ancestor of  |John_Constantine|John_Constantine| , as revealed in the miniseries The Sandman Presents: Love Street.     She is also mentioned in the  |Doctor_Who|Doctor_Who|  novel  The Man in the Velvet Mask , set in an alternate post-Revolutionary France.            John Constantine is a  |con_man|Confidence_Trick|  and  |magician|Magician|  who accompanies  |Dream|Dream|  on a quest to find his pouch of sand.      |John_Constantine|John_Constantine|  has his own series, John Constantine: Hellblazer, which occasionally has guest appearances by  |Cain|Cain|  and  |Abel|Abel| . He is also prominently featured in another series,  Swamp Thing , from which he originated.       Ethel Cripps, also known as Ethel Dee, is the mother of  |John_Dee|Doctor_Destiny| . She was the mistress of  |Roderick_Burgess|Roderick_Burgess|  until she fled with  |Ruthven_Sykes|Ruthven_Sykes| .     Her last joy was her son, John Dee, whom she sought for 10 years. She discovered that he had become a living corpse, which happened because of his use of the Sandmans Ruby.     At this time, she was 90 years old, and it was alluded that she had been kept alive by an amulet in the shape of an eye which granted its user protection, the amulet that  |Ruthven_Sykes|Ruthven_Sykes|  had been given by the demon  |Choronzon|Choronzon|  in exchange for Dreams helmet. Sykes, who had been second in command in The Order of Ancient Mysteries, needed protection from  |Roderick_Burgess|Roderick_Burgess|  who was seeking retribution for Sykes treachery of the theft of the £200,000 and Dreams magical items, which were in possession of the Order at the time he fled with Ethel Cripps to San Francisco in 1930. Magical War was declared upon them, and Ruthven knew he would need a way to protect himself from the hexes Burgess sought to put upon him.     In 1936, Ethel walked out on Ruthven, taking with her the amulet of protection and Dreams Ruby. While in his possession, the amulet protected Sykes from Burgess hexes, but without it, he died a messy and painful death, with his insides exploding out of him. The amulet continued to protect Ethel while Choronzon was still in possession of Dreams helmet.     After Dream escaped and sought to regain his items, he descended to Hell to find his helmet. He had to battle Choronzon to regain it, and after his victory, the compact was withdrawn and the power of protection the amulet possessed ended, which also ended the life of Ethel Dee.            John Dee, also known as Doctor Destiny, is a  |DC_Comics|Dc_Comics|  villain whose powers were derived from his use of Dreams Ruby. His name is almost certainly a reference to the real-life  |John_Dee|John_Dee| . He was incarcerated in  |Arkham_Asylum|Arkham_Asylum| , with other  |Batman|Batman|  villains such as  |The_Scarecrow|Scarecrow|  and  |The_Joker|Joker| , until freed by the amulet given to him by his mother, Ethel Dee, former mistress to Roderick Burgess. He had previously fought the  |Sandman|Sandman|  alongside the  |Justice_League|Justice_League| .     John originally named himself Doctor Destiny to protect his mothers surname, but after her death changed it back. The Ruby had drained away his mental and physical state until he was no longer able to sleep or dream without it. This had the unpleasant effect of turning him into a browned, living corpse.     Being able to control dreams, he used the ruby to bring out the darkness and bestiality of many people across the world. He originally sought power, money and mostly the restoration of his human body, but the madness brought about by overuse of the relic drove him to savage, monstruous acts of depravity using the ruby. To quote: I think Ill dismember the world and then Ill dance in the wreckage.     While doing this, over a period of 24 hours he focused the energy of the ruby on several people in a cafe, one of them a friend of Rose Walker and an ex-lover of Foxglove. He used them as puppets, horribly having them murder and degrade each other as if they were toys, until all were dead.     Dream double-bluffed him into destroying the ruby, which Dee believed to be Dreams life. It actually only stored some of his energy, and with it released Dream instead became even more powerful than before. Easily overpowering Dee, Dream decided not to destroy him, and instead returned him to Arkham. Dee was finally able to sleep, and his sadism and depravity faded as he now could again dream.     He has since appeared in  Justice League  and  Justice Society  stories, having retained some residual power from the ruby. Even worse, since he has managed to replicate its power perfectly, the second ruby is now out of his grasp. However, since the new ruby is attuned to him, he has since not regressed to his previous vicious persona, mostly seeking the dominion of dreams or the waking world through dreams.            Wesley Dodds, also known as Sandman, is the original costumed crimefighter who used the name. According to Gaiman, he was merely filling a hole in the universe in a similar way to a process of evolution, in which animals fill up a niche—for instance, what should fly. He is first seen in The Sandman series in a two-panel cameo in issue 1, and another cameo in issue 26. Dream occasionally appeared in dream sequences in Doddss own series,  Sandman Mystery Theatre . The two finally met for real in Gaimans  Sandman Midnight Theatre . Dodds appeared out of costume during  The Sandman: The Wake  . The reason for his prophetic visions is explained as him being embodied with a small portion of Dreams essence. His reasoning for assuming his role as The Sandman is given as nightmares of Dream in his helmet that plague him, until he begins his career as a crimefighter after which; Wesley Dodds sleeps the sleep of the Just.         Foxglove  is a lesbian writer and musician who first appears in  A Game of You .
