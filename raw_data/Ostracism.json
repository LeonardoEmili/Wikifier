A further distinction between these two modes is that ostracism was an automatic procedure that required no initiative from any individual, with the vote simply occurring on the wish of the electorate—a diffuse exercise of power. By contrast, an Athenian trial needed the initiative of a particular citizen-prosecutor. While prosecution often led to a counterattack , no such response was possible in the case of ostracism as responsibility lay with the polity as a whole. In contrast to a trial, ostracism generally reduced political tension rather than increased it.     Although ten years of exile would have been difficult for an Athenian to face, it was relatively mild in comparison to the kind of sentences inflicted by courts; when dealing with politicians held to be acting against the interests of the people, Athenian juries could inflict very severe penalties such as death, unpayably large fines, confiscation of property, permanent exile and loss of citizens rights through ": null

As a reaction, in many of its features the democracy strove to reduce the role of factions as the focus of citizen loyalties. Ostracism, too, may have been intended to work in the same direction: by temporarily decapitating a faction, it could help to defuse confrontations that threatened the order of the State.

When Aristides asked why, the man replied it was because he was sick of hearing him being called the Just . Plutarch,  Perhaps merely the sense that someone had become too arrogant or prominent was enough to get someones name onto an ostrakon. Ostracism rituals could have also been an attempt to dissuade people from covertly committing murder or assassination for intolerable or emerging individuals of power so as to create an open arena or outlet for those harboring primal frustrations and urges or political motivations. The solution for murder, in Gregory H. Padowitzs theory, would then be ostracism which would ultimately be beneficial for all parties—the unfortunate individual would live and get a second chance and society would be spared the ugliness of feuds, civil war, political jams and murder.

In part ostracism lapsed as a procedure at the end of the fifth century because it was replaced by the  graphe paranomon , a regular court action under which a much larger number of politicians might be targeted, instead of just one a year as with ostracism, and with greater severity. But it may already have come to seem like an anachronism as factional alliances organised around important men became increasingly less significant in the later period, and power was more specifically located in the interaction of the individual speaker with the power of the assembly and the courts.

Williams, K. . Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. p. ix Williams suggests that the most common form of ostracism in a modern context is refusing to communicate with a person. By refusing to communicate with a person, that person is effectively ignored and excluded. Williams, K. .Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. pp. 2–18. The advent of the internet has made ostracism much easier to engage in, and conversely much more difficult to detect, with Williams and others describing this online ostracism as cyberostracism . In email communication, in particular, it is relatively easy for a person or organization to ignore and exclude a specific person, through simply refusing to communicate with the person. Karen Douglas thus describes unanswered emails as constituting a form of cyberostracism, Douglas, K. 2008. Antisocial Communication on Electronic Mail and the Internet. In: A. Konjin, M. Tanis, S. Utz, and S Barnes Mediated Interpersonal Communication. . New York: Routledge. p. 203. and similarly Eric Wesselmann and Kipling Williams describe ignored emails as a form of cyberostracism. Wesselmann, E. and Williams, K. 2013. Ostracism and Stages of Coping. In: C. Dewall Oxford Handbook of Social Exclusion. . Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 21.

Alexander Brown similarly found that post-whistleblowing ostracism is a common response, and indeed describes ostracism as form of covert reprisal, as it is normally so difficult to identify and investigate.

While modern Western concepts of ostracism are based upon enforcing conformity within a societally-recognized group, qahr is a private , family-oriented affair of conflict or display of anger  that is never disclosed to the public at large, as to do would be a breach of social etiquette.
