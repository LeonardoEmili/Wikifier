      False cognates are pairs of words that seem to be  |cognates|Cognate|  because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same  |language|Language|  or from different languages, even within the same family. For example, the English word dog and the  |Mbabaram|Mbabaram_Language|  word dog have exactly the same meaning and very similar pronunciations,  |but_by_complete_coincidence|Mbabaram_Languageword_For_Dog| . Likewise, English  much  and Spanish  mucho  which came by their similar meanings via completely different  |Proto_Indo_European|Proto_Indo_European_Language|  roots. This is different from  |false_friends|False_Friend| , which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, but which may in fact be etymologically related.     Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect connection between them .       The term false cognate is sometimes misused to refer to  |false_friends|False_Friend| , but the two phenomena are distinct. False friends occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings. While some false friends are also false cognates, many are genuine cognates . For example, English pretend and French pr√©tendre are false friends, but not false cognates, as they have the same origin.        Note: Some etymologies may be simplified to avoid overly long descriptions.
