           Eurostar is an international  |high-speed_rail|High-Speed_Rail| way service connecting  |London|London|  with  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam| ,  |Avignon|Avignon| ,  |Brussels|Brussels| ,  |Bourg-Saint-Maurice|Bourg-Saint-Maurice| ,  |Disneyland_Paris|Disneyland_Paris| ,  |Lille|Lille| ,  |Fréthun|Fréthun| ,  |Lyon|Lyon| ,  |Marseille|Marseille| ,  |Paris|Paris| , and  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam| . All its trains travel through the  |Channel_Tunnel|Channel_Tunnel|  between the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  and  |France|France| , owned and operated separately by  |Getlink|Getlink| .     The London terminus is  |St_Pancras_International|St_Pancras_Railway_Station| , the other British calling points are  |Ebbsfleet_International|Ebbsfleet_International_Railway_Station|  and  |Ashford_International|Ashford_International_Railway_Station|  in Kent. Intermediate calling points in France are  |Calais-Fréthun|Gare_De_Calais-Fréthun|  and  |Lille-Europe|Gare_De_Lille-Europe| , with trains to Paris terminating at  |Gare_du_Nord|Gare_Du_Nord| . Trains to Belgium terminate at  |Midi/Zuid_station|Brussels-South_Railway_Station|  in Brussels. The only intermediate calling station in the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  is  |Rotterdam_Centraal|Rotterdam_Centraal_Station|  and trains terminate at  |Amsterdam_Centraal|Amsterdam_Centraal_Station| . There are direct services from London to  |Disneyland_Paris|Disneyland_Paris|  at  |Marne-la-Vallée_–_Chessy|Gare_De_Marne-La-Vallée_-_Chessy| , direct services to southern France , and seasonal direct services to the French Alps in winter .     The service is operated by eighteen-coach  |Class_373/1_trains|British_Rail_Class_373|  and sixteen-coach  trains which run at up to  on a network of high-speed lines. The  |LGV_Nord|Lgv_Nord|  line in France opened before Eurostar services began in 1994, and newer lines enabling faster journeys were added later— |HSL_1|Hsl_1|  in Belgium and  |High_Speed_1|High_Speed_1|  in south-east England. The French and Belgian parts of the network are shared with Paris–Brussels  |Thalys|Thalys|  services and  |TGV|Tgv|  trains. In the United Kingdom the two-stage  |Channel_Tunnel_Rail_Link|High_Speed_1|  project was completed on 14 November 2007 and renamed High Speed 1, when the London terminus of Eurostar moved from London  |Waterloo_International|Waterloo_International_Railway_Station|  to  |St_Pancras_International|St_Pancras_Railway_Station| .     Until 2010, Eurostar was operated jointly by the national railway companies of France and Belgium,  |SNCF|Sncf|  and  |SNCB/NMBS|Sncb/Nmbs| , and  |Eurostar_Ltd|Eurostar_Ltd|  , a subsidiary of  |London_and_Continental_Railways|London_And_Continental_Railways|  that owned the high-speed infrastructure and stations on the British side. Eurostar has become the dominant operator on the routes it operates, carrying more passengers than all airlines combined. Other operators expressed an interest in starting competing services following deregulation in 2010. On 1 September 2010, Eurostar was incorporated as a single corporate entity,  |Eurostar_International_Limited|Eurostar_International_Limited|  , replacing the joint operation between EUKL, SNCF and SNCB/NMBS.  EIL is owned by  |SNCF|Sncf|  ,  |Caisse_de_dépôt_et_placement_du_Québec|Caisse_De_Dépôt_Et_Placement_Du_Québec|  ,  |Hermes_Infrastructure|Hermes_Infrastructure|  and  |SNCB|Nmbs/Sncb|  .        In June 2014, the UK shareholding in Eurostar International Limited was transferred from London and Continental Railways /  |Department_for_Transport|Department_For_Transport|  to  |HM_Treasury|Hm_Treasury| .  That October, it was announced that the UK government planned to raise £300 million by selling its stake.  In March 2015, the UK government announced that it would sell its 40% share to an Anglo-Canadian consortium made up of the Caisse and Hermes Infrastructure. The sale was completed in May 2015.                 The history of Eurostar can be traced to the 1986 choice of a rail tunnel to provide a cross-channel link between Britain and France.  A previous attempt to construct a tunnel between the two nations had begun in 1974, but was quickly aborted. Construction began on a new basis in 1988.  |Eurotunnel|Getlink|  was created to manage and own the tunnel, which was finished in 1993, the official opening taking place on 6 May 1994.     In addition to the tunnels  |shuttle_trains|Eurotunnel_Shuttle|  carrying cars and lorries between  |Folkestone|Folkestone|  and  |Calais|Calais| , the decision to build a railway tunnel opened up the possibility of through passenger and freight train services between places further afield.   |British_Rail|British_Rail|  and SNCF contracted with Eurotunnel to use half the tunnels capacity for this purpose. In 1987, Britain, France and Belgium set up an International Project Group to specify a train to provide an international high-speed passenger service through the tunnel. France had been operating high-speed TGV services since 1981, and had begun construction of a new high-speed line between Paris and the Channel Tunnel, LGV Nord; French TGV technology was chosen as the basis for the new trains. An order for 30 trainsets, to be manufactured in France but with some British and Belgian components, was placed in December 1989. On 20 June 1993, the first Eurostar test train travelled through the tunnel to the UK. Various technical difficulties in running the new trains on British tracks were quickly overcome.            On 14 November 1994, Eurostar services began running from  |Waterloo_International|Waterloo_International_Railway_Station|  station in London, to  |Gare_du_Nord|Gare_Du_Nord|  in Paris, and  |Brussels-South_railway_station|Brussels-South_Railway_Station|  in Brussels.   The train service started with a limited Discovery service; the full daily service started from 28 May 1995.      In 1995, Eurostar was achieving an average end-to-end speed of  from London to Paris.    On 8 January 1996, Eurostar launched services from a second railway station in the UK when  |Ashford_International|Ashford_International_Railway_Station|  was opened.      On 23 September 2003, passenger services began running on the first completed section of  |High_Speed_1|High_Speed_1| . Following a high-profile glamorous opening ceremony  and a large advertising campaign,  on 14 November 2007, Eurostar services in London transferred from Waterloo to the extended and extensively refurbished  |St_Pancras_International|St_Pancras_International| .             The Channel Tunnel used by Eurostar services holds the record for having the longest underwater section of any tunnel in the world,  and it is the second-longest railway tunnel in the world.      On 30 July 2003, a Eurostar train set a new British  |speed_record|List_Of_Vehicle_Speed_Records|  of  on the first section of the High Speed 1 railway between the Channel Tunnel, and Fawkham Junction in north Kent, two months before official public services began running.     On 16 May 2006, Eurostar set a new record for the longest non-stop high-speed journey, a distance of  from  |London|London|  to  |Cannes|Cannes|  taking 7 hours 25 minutes.      On 4 September 2007, a record-breaking train left Paris Gare du Nord at 10:44  and reached London St Pancras in 2  hours 3  minutes 39 seconds;  carrying journalists and railway workers. This record trip was also the first passenger-carrying arrival to the new  |St_Pancras_International_station|St_Pancras_Railway_Station| .      On 20 September 2007, Eurostar broke another record when it completed the journey from Brussels to London in 1  hour, 43  minutes.              The original proposals for Eurostar included direct services to Paris and Brussels from cities north of London :  |Manchester|Manchester|  via  |Birmingham|Birmingham|  on the  |West_Coast_Main_Line|West_Coast_Main_Line|  and on the  |East_Coast_Main_Line|East_Coast_Main_Line| |Leeds|Leeds|  and  |Glasgow|Glasgow|  via  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| ,  |Newcastle|Newcastle_Upon_Tyne|  and  |York|York| .  Seven 14-coach NoL Eurostar trains for these  |Regional_Eurostar|Regional_Eurostar|  services were built, but these services never came to fruition. Predicted journey times of almost nine hours for Glasgow to Paris at the time of growth of  |low-cost_air_travel|Low-Cost_Carrier|  during the 1990s made the plans commercially unviable against the cheaper and quicker airlines.  Other reasons that have been suggested for these services having never been run were both government policies and the disruptive  |privatisation_of_British_Rail|Privatisation_Of_British_Rail| .    Three of the Regional Eurostar units were leased by  |Great_North_Eastern_Railway|Great_North_Eastern_Railway|  to increase domestic services from  |London_Kings_Cross|London_Kings_Cross_Railway_Station|  to  |York|York|  and later  |Leeds|Leeds| .  The lease expired in December 2005, and most of the NoL sets have since been transferred to  |SNCF|Sncf|  for  |TGV|Tgv|  services in northern France.      An international  |Nightstar|Nightstar|  sleeper train was also planned; this would have travelled the same routes as Regional Eurostar, plus the  |Great_Western_Main_Line|Great_Western_Main_Line|  to  |Cardiff|Cardiff| .  These were also deemed commercially unviable, and the scheme was abandoned with no services ever operated. In 2000, the coaches were sold to  |Via_Rail|Via_Rail|  in Canada.               Ashford International station was the original station for Eurostar services in Kent.    Once Ebbsfleet International railway station, also designed to serve the  |Kent|Kent|  region, had opened, only three trains a day to Paris and one to Disneyland Paris called at Ashford for a considerable amount of time. There were fears that services at Ashford International might be further reduced or withdrawn altogether as Eurostar planned to make Ebbsfleet the new regional hub instead.   However, after a period during which no Brussels trains served the station,  to the dissatisfaction of the local communities,    Eurostar re-introduced a single daily Ashford-Brussels service on 23 February 2009.         In 2015, Eurostar threatened to require that cyclists dismantle bicycles before they could be transported on the trains. Following criticism from  |Boris_Johnson|Boris_Johnson|  and cycling groups, Eurostar reversed the edict.        By March 2016, onboard entertainment was provided by  |GoMedia|Gomedia| , including Wi-Fi connectivity and up to 300 hours of movies and television kept on the trains servers and accessed using the passengers own devices: mobile phones, tablets, laptops etc. A tracker app allows customers to see where they are.                     LGV Nord is a French -long  |high-speed_rail|High-Speed_Rail|  line that connects Paris to the Belgian border and the Channel Tunnel via  |Lille|Lille| . It opened in 1993.    Its extensions to Belgium and towards Paris, as well as connecting to the Channel Tunnel, have made LGV Nord a part of every Eurostar journey undertaken. A Belgian high-speed line, HSL 1, was added to the end of LGV Nord, at the Belgian border, in 1997. Of all French high-speed lines, LGV Nord sees the widest variety of high-speed rolling stock and is quite busy; a proposed cut-off bypassing Lille, which would reduce Eurostar journey times to Paris, is called  |LGV_Picardie|Lgv_Picardie| .          The Channel Tunnel is the most important part of the route as it is the only rail connection between Great Britain and the European mainland. It joins LGV Nord in France with High Speed One in Britain. Tunnelling began in 1988, and the  tunnel was officially opened by British sovereign  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and the French President  |François_Mitterrand|François_Mitterrand|  at a ceremony in Calais on 6 May 1994.    It is owned by  |Getlink|Getlink| , which charges a significant toll to Eurostar for its use.    In 1996, the  |American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers|American_Society_Of_Civil_Engineers|  named the tunnel as one of the  |Seven_Wonders_of_the_Modern_World|Wonders_Of_The_Worldamerican_Society_Of_Civil_Engineers| .    Along the current route of the Eurostar service, line speeds are  except within the Channel Tunnel, where a reduced speed of  applies for safety reasons.     Since the launch of Eurostar services, severe disruptions and cancellations have been caused by fires breaking out within the Channel Tunnel, such as in  |1996|1996_Channel_Tunnel_Fire| ,   |2006|Channel_Tunnelfires|  ,   |2008|2008_Channel_Tunnel_Fire|  and 2015.                Until the opening on 2 June 1996, of the first phase of the Belgian high speed line,  Eurostar trains were routed via the  |Belgian_railway_line_94|Belgian_Railway_Line_94| . The Eurostar routes still use the line as a diversion if engineering works are taking place on HSL1, depending where it is. The 06:13 from London St Pancras to Brussels still uses the line as a diversion to bypass the peak time disruptions on HSL1 due to the extra TGV services from Brussels for the commuters. After 2 June 1996, some Eurostars to Brussels were routed via the first phase of the Belgian High Speed line and the Belgian railway line 78 via  |Mons|Mons| . Although this line is still as a diversion if HSL1 is doing engineering, also depending where the maintenance is taking place. Journey times between London and Brussels were improved when an  Belgian high-speed line,  |HSL_1|Hsl_1| , opened on 14 December 1997.   It links with LGV Nord on the border with France, allowing Eurostar trains heading to Brussels to make the transition between the two without having to reduce speed. A further four-minute improvement for London–Brussels trains was achieved in December 2006, with the opening of the   |Brussels_South_Viaduct|Brussels_South_Viaduct| .  Linking the international platforms of Brussels-South railway station with the high-speed line, the viaduct separates Eurostar from local services.             High Speed 1 , formerly known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link , is a  high-speed railway line running from London through  |Kent|Kent|  to the British end of the Channel Tunnel.     It was built in two stages. The first section between the tunnel and  |Fawkham_Junction|Fawkham_Junction|  in north Kent opened in September 2003, cutting London–Paris journey times by 21  minutes to 2  hours 35  minutes, and London–Brussels to 2  hours 20  minutes. On 14 November 2007, commercial services began over the whole of the new HS1 line. The redeveloped St Pancras International station became the new London  |terminus|Terminal_Train_Station|  for all Eurostar services.    The completion of High Speed 1 has brought the British part of Eurostars route up to the same standards as the French and Belgian high-speed lines. Non-stop journey times were reduced by a further 20  minutes to 2  hours 15  minutes for London–Paris and 1  hour 51  minutes for London–Brussels.                Eurostar offers up to sixteen weekday London – Paris services including ten non-stop . Previously there were ten London–Lille and Brussels services, including five running non-stop as far as Lille, but this has now been reduced to seven each way.   In addition, there is a return trip from London to  |Marne-la-Vallée_-_Chessy|Gare_De_Marne-La-Vallée_-_Chessy|  for  |Disneyland_Paris|Disneyland_Resort_Paris| ,  which runs 5-6 times a week with increased frequency during school holidays, and an up-to-5-times-a-week service to Marseille via Lyon and Avignon. There are also seasonal services in the winter. Snow trains ,  aimed at skiers, to  |Bourg-Saint-Maurice|Bourg-Saint-Maurice| ,  |Aime-la-Plagne|La_Plagne|  and  |Moûtiers|Moûtiers|  in the  |Alps|Alps| ; these run twice-weekly, one overnight and one during the daytime.  Intermediate stations are Ebbsfleet International in northwest Kent, Ashford International in southeast Kent, and  |Calais-Fréthun|Gare_De_Calais-Fréthun|  and Lille-Europe in Nord-Pas-de-Calais.  In February 2018, Eurostar announced the start of its long planned service from London to Amsterdam, with an initial two trains per day from April of that year running between St Pancras and  |Amsterdam_Centraal|Amsterdam_Centraal_Station| . This launched as a one-way service, with return trains carrying passengers to Rotterdam and Brussels Midi/Zuid, making a 28-minute stop and then carrying different passengers from Brussels to London.  Passengers travelling back must take  |Thalys|Thalys|  services to Brussels Midi/Zuid where they can join the Eurostar. This is owing to the lack of  |UK_Border_Force|Uk_Border_Force|  facilities at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal.     Since 14 November 2007, all Eurostar trains have been routed via High Speed  1 to or from the redeveloped London terminus at St Pancras International, which at a cost of £800  million was extensively rebuilt and extended to cope with  long Eurostar trains.      It had originally been intended to retain some Eurostar services at  |Waterloo_International|Waterloo_International_Railway_Station| , but this was ruled out on cost grounds.    Completion of High Speed  1 has increased the potential number of trains serving London. Separation of Eurostar from British domestic services through Kent meant that timetabling was no longer affected by peak-hour restrictions.          Eurostars fares were significantly higher in its early years; the cheapest fare in 1994 was £99 return.    In 2002, Eurostar was planning cheaper fares, an example of which was an offer of £50 day returns from London to Paris or Brussels.     By March 2003, the cheapest fare from the UK was £59 return, available all year around. In June 2009 it was announced that one-way single fares would be available at £31 at the cheapest. Competition between Eurostar and airline services was a large factor in ticket prices being reduced from the initial levels.     Business Premier fares also slightly undercut air fares on similar routes, targeted at regular business travellers.    In 2009, Eurostar greatly increased its budget ticket availability to help maintain and grow its dominant market share.    The Eurostar ticketing system is very complex, being distributed through no fewer than 48 individual sales systems.    Eurostar is a member of the  |Amadeus_CRS|Amadeus_Crs|  distribution system, making its tickets available alongside those of airlines worldwide.       |First_class|First_Class_Travel|  on Eurostar is called Business Premier; benefits include guaranteed faster checking-in and meals served at-seat, as well as the improved furnishings and interior of Business Premier carriages.    The rebranding is part of Eurostars marketing drive to attract more business professionals.  Increasingly, business people in a group have been chartering private carriages as opposed to individual seats on the train.                Without the operation of  |Regional_Eurostar|Regional_Eurostar|  services using the North of London trainsets across the rest of Britain, Eurostar has developed its connections with other transport services instead, such as integrating effectively with traditional UK rail operators schedules and routes, making it possible for passengers to use Eurostar as a quick connection to further destinations on the continent.    All three main terminals used by the Eurostar service – St Pancras International, Paris Gare du Nord, and Brussels Midi/Zuid – are served by domestic trains and by local urban transport networks such as the  |London_Underground|London_Underground|  and the  |Paris_Metro|Paris_Metro| . Standard Eurostar tickets no longer include free onward connections to or from any other station in Belgium: this is now available for a flat-rate supplement, currently £5.50.      Eurostar has announced several partnerships with other rail services,    most notably  |Thalys|Thalys|  connections at Lille and Brussels for passengers to go beyond current Eurostar routes towards the Netherlands and Germany.    In 2002, Eurostar initiated the Eurostar-Plus program, offering connecting tickets for onward journeys from Lille and Paris to dozens of destinations in France.   Through fares are also available from 68 British towns and cities to destinations in France and Belgium.    In May 2009 Eurostar announced that a formal connection to Switzerland had been established in a partnership between Eurostar and  |Lyria|Tgv_Lyria| , which will operate TGV services from Lille to the Swiss Alps for Eurostar connection.        In May 2019, Eurostar ended its agreement with Deutsche Bahn that allowed passengers to travel by train from the UK to Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Under the agreement passengers could travel on a single booking which made rescheduling easier. However, the direct tickets will no longer be sold from 9 November 2019.                  Because the UK is not part of the  |Schengen_Area|Schengen_Area| ,  and because Belgium and France are not part of the  |Common_Travel_Area|Common_Travel_Area| , all Eurostar passengers must go through border controls. Both the British Government and the Schengen governments concerned have legal obligations to check the travel documents of those entering their respective countries .     To allow passengers to walk off the train without arrival checks in most cases,  |juxtaposed_controls|Juxtaposed_Controls|  ordinarily take place at the embarkation station.     In order to comply with special UK legislation,  there are full security checks similar to those at airports, scanning both bags and peoples pockets. Security checks at Eurostar are comparable to those at a small airport and generally much quicker than at London Heathrow.  The recommended check-in time is 30 minutes except for business class where it is 10 minutes.     Eurostar passengers travelling inside the  |Schengen_Area|Schengen_Area|  pass through a separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter the preallocated cars of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without the right to do so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.  Travel from Calais or Lille towards Brussels and Amsterdam, from Brussels to Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam and Rotterdam to Brussels has no border or security control; trains from Amsterdam are emptied at Brussels and passengers seeking to continue onwards towards London must alight and pass through security and border control.     When the tripartite agreements were signed, the  |Belgian_Government|Belgian_Federal_Government|  said that it had serious questions about the compatibility of this agreement with the Schengen Convention and the principle of free movement of people enshrined in various European Treaties.  , 23 July 1996   On 30 June 2009 Eurostar raised concerns at the  |UK_House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  Home Affairs Select Committee that it was illegal under French law for the collection of information desired by the UK government under the  |e-Borders|Border_Control|  scheme, and they would be unable to cooperate.       On the northbound Marne la Vallée-Chessy - London train, the security check and French passport check take place at Marne la Vallée-Chessy, while the UK passport check takes place at the UK arrival stations - this is the only route where passengers are not cleared by UK border officials before crossing the channel.     On the northbound Marseille-London train, there is no facility for security or passport checks at the southern French stations, so passengers must leave the train at Lille-Europe, taking all their belongings with them, and undergo security and border checks there before rejoining the train which waits at the station for just over an hour.      On several occasions, people have illegally tried to stow away on board the train,   sometimes in large groups,  trying to enter the UK; border monitoring and security is therefore extremely tight.    Eurostar claims to have good and well-funded security measures.              Eurostars punctuality has fluctuated from year to year, but usually remains over 90%;  in the first quarter of 1999, 89% of services operated were on time, and in the second quarter it reached 92%.  Eurostars best punctuality record was 97.35%, between 16 and 22 August 2004.  In 2006, it was 92.7%,  and in 2007, 91.5% were on time. Eurostar uses the airlines definition of on-time: within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival time. The measure used for long-distance services in the UK rail industry is within 10 minutes.  In the first quarter of 2009, 96% of Eurostar services were punctual, compared with rival air routes 76%.      An advantage held by Eurostar is the convenience and speed of the service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing   and high punctuality, it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market.  In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.      Eurostars passenger numbers initially failed to meet predictions. In 1996,  |London_and_Continental_Railways|London_And_Continental_Railways|  forecast that passenger numbers would reach 21.4  million annually by 2004,  but only 7.3  million was achieved. 82 million passengers used Waterloo International Station from its opening in 1994 to its closure in 2007. 2008 was a record year for Eurostar, with a 10.3% rise in passenger use,  which was attributed to the use of High Speed 1 and the move to St Pancras.  The following year, Eurostar saw an 11.5% fall in passenger numbers  during the first three months of 2009, attributed to the  |2008_Channel_Tunnel_fire|2008_Channel_Tunnel_Fire|   and the  |2009_recession|2009_Recession| .      As a result of the poor economic conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme.  Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.      In 2006, the  |Department_for_Transport|Department_For_Transport|  predicted that, by 2037, annual cross-channel passenger numbers would probably reach 16 million,  considerably less optimistic than London and Continental Railwayss original 1996 forecast. In 2007 Eurostar set a target of carrying 10  million passengers by 2010.    The company cited several factors to support this objective, such as improved journey times, punctuality and station facilities. Passengers in general, it stated, are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental effects of air travel, and Eurostar services emit much less  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| .  and that its remaining carbon emissions are now  |offset|Carbon_Offset| , making its services  |carbon_neutral|Carbon_Neutral| .   Further expansion of the high-speed rail network in Europe, such as the  |HSL-Zuid|Hsl-Zuid|  line between Belgium and the Netherlands, continues to bring more destinations within rail-competitive range, giving Eurostar the possibility of opening up new services in future.     The following chart presents the estimated number of passengers annually transported by the Eurostar service since 1995:                            Eurostar has been hailed as having set new standards in international rail travel and has won praise several times over, recognising its high standards.    Eurostar won the  |Train_Operator_of_the_Year|Train_Operator_Of_The_Year|  award in the  |HSBC|Hsbc|  Rail Awards for 2005. It was declared the Best Train Company in the joint  |Guardian|The_Guardian| / |Observer|The_Observer|  Travel Awards 2008.  Eurostar had previously struggled with its reputation and brand image. One commentator had defined the situation at the time as:       By 2008, Eurostars environmental credentials had become highly developed and promoted.  In 2006 Eurostars Environment Group was set up,  with the aim of making changes in the Eurostar services daily running to decrease the environmental impact, the organisation setting itself a target of reducing carbon emissions per passenger journey by 25% by 2012.  Drivers are trained in techniques to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and lighting has been minimised; the provider of the bulk of the energy for the Channel Tunnel has been switched to nuclear power stations in France.      Eurostars current target is to reduce emissions by 35 percent per passenger journey by 2012, putting itself beyond the efforts of other railway companies in this field and thereby winning the 2007  |Network_Rail|Network_Rail|  Efficiency Award.   In the grand opening ceremony of St Pancras International, one of the Eurostar trains was given the name Tread Lightly, said to symbolise their smaller impact on the environment compared to planes. , video clip on YouTube.          Since 2010, Eurostar has been owned by Eurostar International Limited , a company jointly owned by  |SNCF|Sncf|  ,  ,  |Hermes_Infrastructure|Hermes_Infrastructure|  and  |SNCB|Sncb|  .       Eurostar is a member of  |Railteam|Railteam| , a marketing alliance formed in July 2007 of seven European  |high-speed_rail|High-Speed_Rail|  operators.    The alliance plans to allow tickets to be booked from one end of Europe to the other on a single website. In June 2009 London and Continental Railways, and the Eurostar UK operations they held ownership of, became fully  |nationalised|Nationalised|  by the UK government.             In addition to its multiple unit fleet units, Eurostar operates a single  |Class_08|British_Rail_Class_08|  diesel shunter as the pilot at  |Temple_Mills_depot|Temple_Mills| .  – The Railway Centre, 02/10/07                    Built between 1992 and 1996, Eurostars fleet consists of 38  |EMU|Electric_Multiple_Unit|  trains, designated Class 373 in the United Kingdom and TGV TMST in France. The units have also been branded as the Eurostar e300 by Eurostar since 2015. There are two variants:   31 Inter-Capital sets consisting of two  |power_cars|Power_Car|  and eighteen passenger carriages. These trains are  long and can carry 750 passengers: 206 in first class, 544 in standard class.    7 shorter North of London sets which have two  |power_cars|Power_Car|  and fourteen passenger carriages and are  long. These sets have a capacity of 558 seats: 114 first class, 444 standard and which were designed to operate the aborted  |Regional_Eurostar|Regional_Eurostar|  services.     The trains are essentially modified  |TGV|Tgv|  sets,   and can operate at up to  on high-speed lines, and  in the Channel Tunnel. It is possible to exceed the 300-kilometre-per-hour speed limit, but only with special permission from the safety authorities in the respective country.    Speed limits in the Channel Tunnel are dictated by air-resistance, energy dissipation and the need to fit in with other, slower trains. The trains were designed with Channel Tunnel safety in mind, and consist of two independent half-sets each with its own power car. In the event of a serious fire on board while travelling through the tunnel, passengers would be transferred into the undamaged half of the train, which would then be detached and driven out of the tunnel to safety.    If the undamaged part were the rear half of the train, this would be driven by the Chef du Train, who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear driving cab while the train travels through the tunnel for this purpose.      As 27 of the 31 Inter-Capital sets are sufficient to operate the service, four are currently used by SNCF for domestic TGV services; one of these regularly operates a Paris–Lille shuttle. The Eurostar logos have been removed from these sets, but the base colours of white, black, and yellow remain. SNCFs lease of the sets is scheduled to last until 2011, with an option for a further two years.      Each train has a unique four-digit number starting with 3 . This designates the train as a Mark 3 TGV . The second digit denotes the country of ownership:   30xx UK   31xx Belgium   32xx France   33xx Regional Eurostar        In 2004–2005 the Inter-Capital sets still in daily use for international services were refurbished with a new interior designed by  |Philippe_Starck|Philippe_Starck| .    The original grey-yellow scheme in Standard class and grey-red of First/Premium First were replaced with a grey-brown look in Standard and grey-burnt-orange in First class. Power points were added to seats in First class and coaches 5 and 14 in Standard class. Premium First class was renamed BusinessPremier.     In 2008, Eurostar announced that it would be carrying out a mid-life refurbishment of its Class 373 trains to allow the fleet to remain in service beyond 2020.    This will include the 28 units making up the Eurostar fleet, but not the three Class 373/1 units used by SNCF or the seven Class 373/2 North of London sets.    As part of the refurbishment, the Italian company  |Pininfarina|Pininfarina|  was contracted to redesign the interiors,  and The Yard Creative was selected to design the new buffet cars.    On 11 May 2009 Eurostar revealed the new look for its first-class compartments.    The first refurbished train was due in service in 2012,  and Eurostar plans to have completed the entire process by 2014.        On 13 November 2014 Eurostar announced the first refurbished trains would not re-enter the fleet until the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2015 due to delays at the completion centre.     The last refurbished e300 re-entered service in April 2019.          In addition to the announced mid-life update of the existing Class 373 fleet, Eurostar in 2009 reportedly entered prequalification bids for eight new trainsets to be purchased.  Any new trains would need to meet the same safety rules governing passage through the Channel Tunnel as the existing Class 373 fleet. The replacement to the Class 373 trains has been decided jointly between the French Transport Ministry and the UK  |Department_for_Transport|Department_For_Transport| . The new trains will be equipped to use the new  |ERTMS|Ertms|  in-cab signalling system, due to be fitted to High Speed 1 around 2040.         On 7 October 2010, it was reported that Eurostar had selected  |Siemens|Siemens|  as preferred bidder to supply 10  |Siemens_Velaroe|Siemens_Velaro| 320 trainsets at a cost of €600 million  to operate an expanded route network, including services from London to  |Cologne|Cologne|  and  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam| .  These would be sixteen-car,  long trainsets built to meet current Channel Tunnel regulations. The top speed will be  and they will have 894–950 seats, unlike the current fleet built by the French company  |Alstom|Alstom| , which has a top speed of  and a seating capacity of 750. Total traction power will be rated at 16 MW.
