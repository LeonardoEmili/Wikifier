When customers needed to transfer data from one system to another, it was necessary to write translators from one format to other. As the number of formats  multiplied, the translator issue became an N-squared problem. The expectation was that with EDIF the number of translators could be reduced to the number of involved systems.     Representatives of the EDA companies ": null

The basic tokens of EDIF 2.0.0 were keywords , strings , integer numbers, symbolic constants  and Identifiers , which are reference labels formed from a very restricted set of characters.   EDIF 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 dropped the symbolic constants entirely, using keywords instead.   So, the syntax of EDIF has a fairly simple foundation. A typical EDIF file looks like this:              ": null
