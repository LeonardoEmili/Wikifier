   Jerome David Kern was an American  |composer|Composer|  of  |musical_theatre|Musical_Theatre|  and popular music. One of the most important American theatre composers of the early 20th century, he wrote more than 700 songs, used in over 100 stage works, including such classics as  |Ol_Man_River|Ol_Man_River|  ,  |Cant_Help_Lovin_Dat_Man|Cant_Help_Lovin_Dat_Man|  ,  |A_Fine_Romance|A_Fine_Romance|  ,  |Smoke_Gets_in_Your_Eyes|Smoke_Gets_In_Your_Eyes|  ,  |The_Song_Is_You|The_Song_Is_You|  ,  |All_the_Things_You_Are|All_The_Things_You_Are|  ,  |The_Way_You_Look_Tonight|The_Way_You_Look_Tonight|  ,  |Long_Ago|Long_Ago|  and  |Who?|Who?|  . He collaborated with many of the leading librettists and lyricists of his era, including  |George_Grossmith_Jr.|George_Grossmith_Jr.| ,  |Guy_Bolton|Guy_Bolton| ,  |P._G._Wodehouse|P._G._Wodehouse| ,  |Otto_Harbach|Otto_Harbach| ,  |Oscar_Hammerstein_II|Oscar_Hammerstein_Ii| ,  |Dorothy_Fields|Dorothy_Fields| ,  |Johnny_Mercer|Johnny_Mercer| ,  |Ira_Gershwin|Ira_Gershwin|  and  |Yip_Harburg|Yip_Harburg| .     A native  |New_Yorker|New_York_City| , Kern created dozens of  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  musicals and  |Hollywood_films|Musical_Films|  in a career that lasted for more than four decades. His musical innovations, such as 4/4 dance rhythms and the employment of syncopation and  |jazz|Jazz|  progressions, built on, rather than rejected, earlier musical theatre tradition. He and his collaborators also employed his melodies to further the action or develop characterization to a greater extent than in the other musicals of his day, creating the model for later musicals. Although dozens of Kerns musicals and  |musical_films|Musical_Film|  were hits, only  Show Boat  is now regularly revived. Songs from his other shows, however, are still frequently performed and adapted. Many of Kerns songs have been adapted by jazz musicians to become  |standard_tunes|Jazz_Standard| .           Kern was born in New York City, on  |Sutton_Place|Sutton_Place,_Manhattan| , in what was then the citys brewery district. . The New York Times, November 12, 1945 His parents were Henry Kern , a Jewish German immigrant, and Fannie Kern née Kakeles , who was an American Jew of  |Bohemia|Bohemia| n parentage.

Bakers Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, Volume 3 , accessed May 10, 2010  At the time of Kerns birth, his father ran a stable; later he became a successful merchant. Kern grew up on East 56th Street in  |Manhattan|Manhattan| , where he attended public schools. He showed an early aptitude for music and was taught to play the piano and organ by his mother, an accomplished player and teacher. Byrnside, Ronald and  |Andrew_Lamb|Andrew_Lamb| . . Grove Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed May 10, 2010 .     In 1897, the family moved to  |Newark,_New_Jersey|Newark,_New_Jersey| , where Kern attended Newark High School . He wrote songs for the schools first musical, a  |minstrel_show|Minstrel_Show| , in 1901, and for an amateur musical adaptation of  Uncle Toms Cabin  put on at the Newark Yacht Club in January 1902. Kern left high school before graduation in the spring of his senior year in 1902. In response, Kerns father insisted that his son work with him in business, instead of composing. Kern, however, failed miserably in one of his earliest tasks: he was supposed to purchase two pianos for the store, but instead he ordered 200.  at GuidetoMusicalTheatre.com, accessed May 17, 2010 His father relented, and later in 1902, Kern became a student at the  |New_York_College_of_Music|New_York_College_Of_Music| , studying the piano under Alexander Lambert and Paolo Gallico, and harmony under Dr. Austin Pierce. His first published composition, a piano piece, At the Casino, appeared in the same year. Between 1903 and 1905, he continued his musical training under private tutors in  |Heidelberg|Heidelberg| , Germany, returning to New York via London. . Who Was Who, accessed May 10, 2010          For a time, Kern worked as a rehearsal pianist in  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  theatres and as a  |song-plugger|Song-Plugger|  for  |Tin_Pan_Alley|Tin_Pan_Alley|  music publishers. While in London, he secured a contract from the American impresario  |Charles_Frohman|Charles_Frohman|  to provide songs for interpolation in Broadway versions of London shows. He began to provide these additions in 1904 to British scores for An English Daisy, by  |Seymour_Hicks|Seymour_Hicks|  and  |Walter_Slaughter|Walter_Slaughter| , and Mr. Wix of Wickham, for which he wrote most of the songs. Bordman, Gerald and Thomas Hischak, eds. . The Oxford Companion to American Theatre, third edition, Oxford University Press 2004. Oxford Reference Online, accessed May 15, 2010     In 1905, Kern contributed the song Howd you like to spoon with me? to  |Ivan_Carylls|Ivan_Caryll|  hit  |musical|Edwardian_Musical_Comedy|   The Earl and the Girl  when the show transferred to Chicago and New York in 1905. He also contributed to the New York production of  The Catch of the Season  , The Little Cherub and  The Orchid  , among other shows. Banfield, p. 11 From 1905 on, he spent long periods of time in London, contributing songs to  |West_End|West_End_Theatre|  shows like  The Beauty of Bath   and making valuable contacts, including  |George_Grossmith_Jr.|George_Grossmith_Jr.|  and Seymour Hicks, who were the first to introduce Kerns songs to the London stage. In 1909 during one of his stays in England, Kern took a boat trip on the  |River_Thames|River_Thames|  with some friends, and when the boat stopped at  |Walton-on-Thames|Walton-On-Thames| , they went to an inn called the Swan for a drink. Kern was much taken with the proprietors daughter, Eva Leale , who was working behind the bar. He wooed her, and they were married at the  |Anglican|Anglican|  church of St. Marys in Walton on October 25, 1910. The couple then lived at the Swan when Kern was in England. Banfield, pp. 13-14; Blackman, p. 10; and . The Swan at Walton-on-Thames, History, accessed May 12, 2010.        Kern is believed to have composed music for  |silent_films|Silent_Film|  as early as 1912, but the earliest documented film music which he is known to have written was for a twenty-part serial, Glorias Romance in 1916. This was one of the first starring vehicles for  |Billie_Burke|Billie_Burke| , for whom Kern had earlier written the song Mind the Paint , with lyrics by  |A._W._Pinero|Arthur_Wing_Pinero| . The film is now considered  |lost|Lost_Film| , but Kerns music survives. Another score for the silent movies, Jubilo, followed in 1919. Banfield, p. 50 Kern was one of the founding members of  |ASCAP|Ascap| .     Kerns first complete score was Broadways  The Red Petticoat  , one of the first musical-comedy Westerns. The libretto was by  |Rida_Johnson_Young|Rida_Johnson_Young| . By  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , more than a hundred of Kerns songs had been used in about thirty productions, mostly Broadway adaptations of West End and European shows. Kern contributed two songs to  To-Nights the Night  , another Rubens musical. It opened in New York and went on to become a hit in London. The best known of Kerns songs from this period is probably  |They_Didnt_Believe_Me|They_Didnt_Believe_Me|  , which was a hit in the New York version of the  |Paul_Rubens|Paul_Rubens|  and  |Sidney_Jones|Sidney_Jones|  musical,  The Girl from Utah  , for which Kern wrote five songs. Kerns song, with four beats to a bar, departed from the customary  |waltz|Waltz| -rhythms of European influence and fitted the new American passion for modern dances such as the  |fox-trot|Fox-Trot| . He was also able to use elements of American styles, such as ragtime, as well as syncopation, in his lively dance tunes. Bordman, Gerald. Jerome David Kern, Innovator/Traditionalist , The Musical Quarterly, Volume 71, no. 4, April 1985, pp. 468-73 Theatre historian  |John_Kenrick|John_Kenrick|  writes that the song put Kern in great demand on Broadway and established a pattern for musical comedy love songs that lasted through the 1960s. Kenrick, John.  History of The Musical Stage, 1910-1919: Part I, The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film     In May 1915, Kern was due to sail with Charles Frohman from New York to London on board the  |RMS_Lusitania|Rms_Lusitania| , but Kern missed the boat, having overslept after staying up late playing poker. Denison, pp. 21–22; and McLean, p. 98 Frohman died in the sinking of the ship. . The New York Times, May 9, 1915, p. 3          Kern composed 16 Broadway scores between 1915 and 1920 and also contributed songs to the London hit  Theodore & Co   and to revues like the  |Ziegfeld_Follies|Ziegfeld_Follies| . The most notable of his scores were those for a series of shows written for the  |Princess_Theatre|Princess_Theatre,_New_York_City| , a small house built by  |Ray_Comstock|Ray_Comstock| . Theatrical agent  |Elisabeth_Marbury|Elisabeth_Marbury|  asked Kern and librettist  |Guy_Bolton|Guy_Bolton|  to create a series of intimate and low-budget, yet smart, musicals.     The Princess Theatre shows were unique on Broadway not only for their small size, but their clever, coherent plots, integrated scores and naturalistic acting, which presented a sharp contrast to the large-scale  |Ruritania|Ruritania| n operettas then in vogue or the star-studded  |revues|Revue|  and extravaganzas of producers like  |Florenz_Ziegfeld|Florenz_Ziegfeld| . Earlier  |musical_comedy|Edwardian_Musical_Comedy|  had often been thinly plotted, gaudy pieces, marked by the insertion of songs into their scores with little regard to the plot. But Kern and Bolton followed the examples of  |Gilbert_and_Sullivan|Gilbert_And_Sullivan|  and French  opéra bouffe  in integrating song and story. These shows built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kerns exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization. The shows featured modern American settings and simple scene changes to suit the small theatre. Kenrick, John. , accessed May 11, 2010        The teams first Princess Theatre show was an adaptation of Paul Rubens 1905 London show, Mr. Popple , called Nobody Home . The piece ran for 135 performances and was a modest financial success. However, it did little to fulfill the new teams mission to innovate, except that Kerns song, The Magic Melody , was the first Broadway showtune with a basic  |jazz|Jazz|  progression. Kern and Bolton next created an original piece,  Very Good Eddie , which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season. The British humorist, lyricist and librettist P. G. Wodehouse joined the Princess team in 1917, adding his skill as a lyricist to the succeeding shows.  Oh, Boy!  ran for an extraordinary 463 performances. Bloom and Vlastnik, pp. 230–31 Oh, Boy! was staged in London as Oh, Joy! in 1919 at the  |Kingsway_Theatre|Kingsway_Theatre| , where it ran for 167 performances: see Jasen, p. 279 Other shows written for the theatre were Have a Heart ,  Leave It to Jane  Because Oh Boy! was a hit at the Princess, Leave It to Jane opened at the  |Longacre_Theatre|Longacre_Theatre|  instead. and  Oh, Lady!

Oxford University Press U.S., 2000, p. 10  Kerns importance to the partnership was illustrated by the fate of the last musical of the series, Oh, My Dear! , to which he contributed only one song: Go, Little Boat . The rest of the show was composed by  |Louis_Hirsch|Louis_Hirsch| , and ran for 189 performances: Despite a respectable run, everyone realized there was little point in continuing the series without Kern.          The 1920s were an extremely productive period in American musical theatre, and Kern created at least one show every year for the entire decade. His first show of 1920 was  The Night Boat , with book and lyrics by  |Anne_Caldwell|Anne_Caldwell| , which ran for more than 300 performances in New York and for three seasons on tour. Later in the same year, Kern wrote the score for  Sally , with a book by Bolton and lyrics by  |Otto_Harbach|Otto_Harbach| . This show, staged by Florenz Ziegfeld, ran for 570 performances, one of the longest runs of any Broadway show in the decade, and popularized the song  |Look_for_the_Silver_Lining|Look_For_The_Silver_Lining|  , performed by the rising star  |Marilyn_Miller|Marilyn_Miller| . It also had a long run in London in 1921, produced by  |George_Grossmith_Jr.|George_Grossmith_Jr.|  Kerns next shows were Good Morning, Dearie which ran for 347 performances; followed in 1922 by a West End success,  The Cabaret Girl  in collaboration with Grossmith and Wodehouse;  The Observer , September 24, 1922, p. 11 another modest success by the same team,  The Beauty Prize  ; and a Broadway flop,  The Bunch and Judy , remembered, if at all, as the first time Kern and  |Fred_Astaire|Fred_Astaire|  worked together.      Stepping Stones  was a success, and in 1924 the Princess Theatre team of Bolton, Wodehouse and Kern reunited to write Sitting Pretty, but it did not recapture the popularity of the earlier collaborations. . Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Oxford Music Online, accessed May 11, 2010 Its relative failure may have been partly due to Kerns growing aversion to having individual songs from his shows performed out of context on radio, in cabaret, or on record, although his chief objection was to jazz interpretations of his songs. He called himself a musical clothier – nothing more or less, and said, I write music to both the situations and the lyrics in plays. When Sitting Pretty was produced, he forbade any broadcasting or recording of individual numbers from the show, which limited their chance to gain popularity.     1925 was a major turning point in Kerns career when he met  |Oscar_Hammerstein_II|Oscar_Hammerstein_Ii| , with whom he would entertain a lifelong friendship and collaboration. As a young man, Kern had been an easy companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, I hear youre a son of a bitch. So am I. Steyn, Mark. Melodies that will always linger on , The Times, January 22, 1985, p. 14 He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms for the rest of his life. Their first show, written together with Harbach, was  Sunny , which featured the song  |Who_?|Who?|  Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in Sally. The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring  |Binnie_Hale|Binnie_Hale|  and  |Jack_Buchanan|Jack_Buchanan| . Kenrick, John. . History of The Musical Stage, accessed May 11, 2010     Show Boat   Because of the strong success of Sally and Sunny and consistent good results with his other shows, Ziegfeld was willing to gamble on Kerns next project in 1927. Kern had been impressed by  |Edna_Ferbers|Edna_Ferber|  novel  Show Boat  and wished to present a musical stage version. He persuaded Hammerstein to adapt it and Ziegfeld to produce it. The story, dealing with racism, marital strife and alcoholism, was unheard of in the escapist world of musical comedy. Despite his doubts, Ziegfeld spared no expense in staging the piece to give it its full epic grandeur. According to the theatre historian John Kenrick: After the opening night audience filed out of the Ziegfeld Theatre in near silence, Ziegfeld thought his worst fears had been confirmed. He was pleasantly surprised when the next morning brought ecstatic reviews and long lines at the box office. In fact, Show Boat proved to be the most lasting accomplishment of Ziegfelds career – the only one of his shows that is regularly performed today. Kenrick, John. . History of The Musical Stage, accessed May 11, 2010 The score is, arguably, Kerns greatest and includes the well-known songs  |Ol_Man_River|Ol_Man_River|  and  |Cant_Help_Lovin_Dat_Man|Cant_Help_Lovin_Dat_Man|  as well as Make Believe ,  |You_Are_Love|You_Are_Love|  , Life Upon the Wicked Stage , Why Do I Love You , all with lyrics by Hammerstein, and  |Bill|Bill|  , originally written for Oh, Lady! Lady!, with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse. Green, Kay, p. 26 The show ran for 572 performances on Broadway and was also a success in London. The London production overcame a tepid review in The Times which praised the scenery at the expense of everything else, and barely mentioned Kerns music. Although Ferbers novel was filmed unsuccessfully as a  |part-talkie|Part-Talkie|  in 1929 , the musical itself was filmed twice, in  |1936|Show_Boat| , and, with  |Technicolor|Technicolor| , in  |1951|Show_Boat| . The Times, September 16, 1929, p. 10; June 11, 1936; and June 15, 1951, p. 6 In 1989, a stage version of the musical was presented on television for the first time, in a production from the  |Paper_Mill_Playhouse|Paper_Mill_Playhouse|  telecast by  |PBS|Pbs|  on  Great Performances .      While most Kern musicals have largely been forgotten, except for their songs, Show Boat remains well-remembered and frequently seen. It is a staple of stock productions and has been revived numerous times on Broadway and in London. A 1946 revival integrated choreography into the show, in the manner of a  |Rodgers_and_Hammerstein|Rodgers_And_Hammerstein|  production, as did the 1994  |Harold_Prince|Harold_Prince| – |Susan_Stroman|Susan_Stroman|  revival, which was nominated for ten  |Tony_Awards|Tony_Awards| , winning five, including best revival. It was the first musical to enter a major opera companys repertory , and the rediscovery of the 1927 score with  |Robert_Russell_Bennetts|Robert_Russell_Bennett|  original orchestrations led to a large-scale  |EMI|Emi_Classics|  recording in 1987 and several opera-house productions. In 1941, the conductor  |Artur_Rodziński|Artur_Rodziński|  wished to commission a symphonic suite from the score, but Kern considered himself a songwriter and not a symphonist. He never orchestrated his own scores, leaving that to musical assistants, principally Frank Saddler and Russell Bennett . In response to the commission, Kern oversaw an arrangement by Charles Miller and Emil Gerstenberger of numbers from the show into the orchestral work Scenario for Orchestra: Themes from Show Boat, premiered in 1941 by the  |Cleveland_Orchestra|Cleveland_Orchestra|  conducted by Rodziński.        Kerns last Broadway show in the 1920s was  Sweet Adeline  , with a libretto by Hammerstein. It was a period piece, set in the Gay 90s, about a girl from  |Hoboken,_New_Jersey|Hoboken,_New_Jersey|  , who becomes a Broadway star. Opening just before the stock market crash, it received rave reviews, but the elaborate, old-fashioned piece was a step back from the innovations in Show Boat, or even the Princess Theatre shows. Brantley, Ben. . The New York Times, February 15, 1997, accessed May 14, 2001 In January 1929, at the height of the  |Jazz_Age|Jazz_Age| , and with Show Boat still playing on Broadway, Kern made news on both sides of the Atlantic for reasons wholly unconnected with music. He sold at auction, at New Yorks Anderson Galleries, the collection of English and American literature that he had been building up for more than a decade. The collection, rich in inscribed first editions and manuscript material of eighteenth and nineteenth century authors, sold for a total of $1,729,462.50 – a record for a single-owner sale that stood for over fifty years. Among the books he sold were first or early editions of poems by  |Robert_Burns|Robert_Burns|  and  |Percy_Bysshe_Shelley|Percy_Bysshe_Shelley| , and works by  |Jonathan_Swift|Jonathan_Swift| ,  |Henry_Fielding|Henry_Fielding|  and  |Charles_Dickens|Charles_Dickens| , as well as manuscripts by  |Alexander_Pope|Alexander_Pope| ,  |John_Keats|John_Keats| , Shelley,  |Lord_Byron|George_Gordon_Byron,_6Th_Baron_Byron| ,  |Thomas_Hardy|Thomas_Hardy|  and others.

Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 17, 2010 Kern returned to Hollywood, where he composed the scores to a dozen more films, although he also continued working on Broadway productions. He settled permanently in Hollywood in 1937. Banfield, p. 55 After suffering a heart attack in 1939, he was told by his doctors to concentrate on film scores, a less stressful task, as Hollywood songwriters were not as deeply involved with the production of their works as Broadway songwriters. This second phase of Kerns Hollywood career had considerably greater artistic and commercial success than the first. With Hammerstein, he wrote songs for the film versions of his recent Broadway shows Music in the Air , which starred  |Gloria_Swanson|Gloria_Swanson|  in a rare singing role, and Sweet Adeline . With  |Dorothy_Fields|Dorothy_Fields| , he composed the new music for  I Dream Too Much  , a musical melodrama about the opera world, starring the  |Metropolitan_Opera|Metropolitan_Opera|  diva  |Lily_Pons|Lily_Pons| .

High, Wide, and Handsome  was intentionally similar in plot and style to Show Boat, but it was a box-office failure. Kern songs were also used in the  |Cary_Grant|Cary_Grant|  film,  When Youre in Love  , and the first  |Abbott_and_Costello|Abbott_And_Costello|  feature,  One Night in the Tropics  . In 1940, Hammerstein wrote the lyric  |The_Last_Time_I_Saw_Paris|The_Last_Time_I_Saw_Paris|  , in homage to the French capital, recently occupied by the Germans. Kern set it, the only time he set a pre-written lyric, and his only hit song not written as part of a musical. Originally a hit for  |Tony_Martin|Tony_Martin|  and later for  |Noël_Coward|Noël_Coward| , the song was used in the film  Lady Be Good  and won Kern another Oscar for best song. Kerns second and last symphonic work was his  |Mark_Twain|Mark_Twain|  Suite .     In his last Hollywood musicals, Kern worked with several new and distinguished partners.
