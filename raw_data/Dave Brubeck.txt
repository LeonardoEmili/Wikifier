           David Warren Brubeck  was an American jazz pianist and composer, considered one of the foremost exponents of  |cool_jazz|Cool_Jazz| . Many of his compositions have become  |jazz_standards|Jazz_Standard|  including  |In_Your_Own_Sweet_Way|In_Your_Own_Sweet_Way|  and The Duke . Brubecks style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting both his mothers classical training and his own improvisational skills. His music is known for employing unusual  |time_signatures|Time_Signature|  as well as superimposing contrasting rhythms,  |meters|Meter| , and  |tonalities|Tonality| .     Brubeck experimented with time signatures throughout his career, recording Pick Up Sticks in ,  |Unsquare_Dance|Unsquare_Dance|  in , Worlds Fair in , and  |Blue_Rondo_à_la_Turk|Blue_Rondo_À_La_Turk|  in . He was also a composer of orchestral and sacred music and wrote soundtracks for television, such as  Mr. Broadway  and the animated miniseries  This Is America, Charlie Brown .     Often incorrectly attributed to Brubeck, the song  |Take_Five|Take_Five|  , which has become a  |jazz_standard|Jazz_Standard| , was composed by Brubecks long-time musical partner, alto saxophonist  |Paul_Desmond|Paul_Desmond| . Appearing on one of the top-selling jazz albums,  Time Out , and written in  time, Take Five has endured as a jazz classic associated with Brubeck.        Dave Brubeck was born in the  |San_Francisco_Bay_Area|San_Francisco_Bay_Area|  city of  |Concord,_California|Concord,_California| , , ci.concord.ca.us. Retrieved September 28, 2007. and grew up in a city located in the Mother Lode called  |Ione,_California|Ione,_California| . His father, Peter Howard Pete Brubeck, was a  |cattle_rancher|Cattle_Rancher| , and his mother, Elizabeth , who had studied piano in England under  |Myra_Hess|Myra_Hess|  and intended to become a  |concert_pianist|Concert_Pianist| , taught piano for extra money.      His father had Swiss ancestry and possibly Native American  |Modoc|Modoc_People|  lineage,  by Ratzo B. Harris, NewMusicBox, December 21, 2012 while his maternal grandparents were English and German.  and possibly Native American Modoc Tribe – see: paragraph one, of the second page of the Dave Brubeck interview by Martin Totusek in  Cadence Magazine  – The Review of Jazz & Blues, December 1994, Vol. 20 No. 12, pp. 5–17  Brubeck originally did not intend to become a musician , but took lessons from his mother. He could not  |read_music|Musical_Notation|  during these early lessons, attributing this difficulty to poor eyesight, but faked his way through well enough that this deficiency went mostly unnoticed.      Intending to work with his father on their ranch, Brubeck entered the College of the Pacific in  |Stockton,_California|Stockton,_California|  , studying  |veterinary_science|Veterinary_Science| . He changed to music on the urging of the head of  |zoology|Zoology| , Dr. Arnold, who told him Brubeck, your minds not here. Its across the lawn in the  |conservatory|Music_School| . Please go there. Stop wasting my time and yours. Its About Time: The Dave Brubeck Story, by Fred M. Hall. Later, Brubeck was nearly expelled when one of his professors discovered that he could not  |read_music_on_sight|Sight-Reading| . Several of his professors came forward, arguing that his ability to write  |counterpoint|Counterpoint|  and  |harmony|Harmony|  more than compensated, and demonstrated his familiarity with music notation. The college was still afraid that it would cause a scandal, and agreed to let Brubeck graduate only after he had promised never to teach piano.      After graduating in 1942, Brubeck was drafted into the  |U.S._Army|U.S._Army| . He served in Europe in the  |Third_Army|Third_United_States_Army| . He volunteered to play piano at a  |Red_Cross|Red_Cross|  show and was such a hit that he was spared from combat service and ordered to form a band. He created one of the U.S. armed forces first  |racially_integrated|Racial_Integration|  bands, The Wolfpack . While serving in the military, Brubeck met  |Paul_Desmond|Paul_Desmond|  in early 1944. Liner notes to the album 25th Anniversary Reunion, Dave Brubeck Quartet He returned to college after serving nearly four years in the army, this time attending  |Mills_College|Mills_College|  in Oakland. He studied under  |Darius_Milhaud|Darius_Milhaud| , who encouraged him to study  |fugue|Fugue|  and  |orchestration|Orchestration| , but not classical piano. While on active duty, he received two lessons from  |Arnold_Schoenberg|Arnold_Schoenberg|  at  |UCLA|University_Of_California,_Los_Angeles|  in an attempt to connect with  |high_modernist|High_Modernism|  theory and practice. Starr, Kevin. 2009. Golden dreams: California in an age of abundance, 1950–1963. Oxford: Oxford University Press. However, the encounter did not end on good terms since Schoenberg believed that every note should be accounted for, an approach which Brubeck could not accept, although according to his son Chris Brubeck, there is a twelve-tone row in The Light in the Wilderness, Dave Brubecks first oratorio. In it, Jesuss twelve  |disciples|Apostle|  are introduced each singing their own individual notes; it is described as “quite dramatic, especially when Judas starts singing Repent on a high and straining dissonant note.”      Jack Sheedy owned San Francisco-based Coronet Records, which had previously recorded area  |Dixieland|Dixieland|  bands.  In 1949, Sheedy was talked into making the first recording of Brubecks octet and later his trio. But Sheedy was unable to pay his bills and in 1949 turned his masters over to his record stamping company, the Circle Record Company, owned by Max and Sol Weiss. The Weiss brothers soon changed the name of their business to  |Fantasy_Records|Fantasy_Records| .     These initial Brubeck records sold well, and he recorded and issued new records for Fantasy. Soon the company was shipping 40,000 to 50,000 copies of Brubeck records each quarter, making enormous profits. Gioia, Ted. Dave Brubeck and Modern Jazz in San Francisco in West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California 1945–1960, University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1998 , pp. 63–64.             In 1951, Brubeck damaged several neck vertebrae and his spinal cord while diving into the surf in  |Hawaii|Hawaii| . He would later remark that the rescue workers who responded had described him as a DOA . Brubeck recovered after a few months, but suffered with residual nerve pain in his hands for years after. The injury also influenced his playing style towards complex, blocky chords rather than speedy, high-dexterity, single-note runs.     Brubeck organized the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951, with  |Paul_Desmond|Paul_Desmond|  on alto saxophone. They took up a long residency at San Franciscos  |Black_Hawk_nightclub|Black_Hawk|  and gained great popularity touring college campuses, recording a series of albums with such titles as  Jazz at Oberlin  ,  Jazz at the College of the Pacific  , and Brubecks debut on  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records| ,  Jazz Goes to College  .     When Brubeck signed with  |Fantasy_Records|Fantasy_Records| , he thought he had a half interest in the company and he worked as a sort of  |A_&_R|Artists_And_Repertoire|  man for the label, encouraging the Weiss brothers to sign other contemporary jazz performers, including  |Gerry_Mulligan|Gerry_Mulligan| ,  |Chet_Baker|Chet_Baker|  and  |Red_Norvo|Red_Norvo| . When he discovered that all he owned was a half interest in his own recording, he quit to sign with another label,  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records| .

In 1954, he was featured on the cover of  Time , the second jazz musician to be so honored .  – February 21, 1949 Brubeck personally found this accolade embarrassing, since he considered  |Duke_Ellington|Duke_Ellington|  more deserving of it and was convinced that he had been favored for being Caucasian.  Ellington himself knocked on the door of Brubecks hotel room to show him the cover and the only reaction Brubeck could give was, “It should have been you.”      Early bassists for the group included Ron Crotty,  |Bob_Bates|Bob_Bates|  and his brother  |Norman_Bates|Norman_Bates| ; Lloyd Davis and Joe Dodge held the drum chair. In 1956 Brubeck hired drummer  |Joe_Morello|Joe_Morello| , who had been working with  |Marian_McPartland|Marian_Mcpartland| ; Morellos presence made possible the rhythmic experiments that were to come. In 1958 African-American bassist  |Eugene_Wright|Eugene_Wright|  joined for the groups  |U.S._Department_of_State|United_States_Department_Of_State|  tour of Europe and Asia.  The group visited Poland, Turkey, India, Sri Lanka , Pakistan, Iran and Iraq on behalf of the U.S. Government. They spent two weeks in Poland, giving thirteen concerts and spending time visiting with Polish musicians and citizens as part of the People-to-People program.  Wright became a permanent member in 1959, making the classic Quartets personnel complete. During the late 1950s and early 1960s Brubeck canceled several concerts because the club owners or hall managers continued to resist the idea of an integrated band on their stages. He also canceled a television appearance when he found out that the producers intended to keep Wright off-camera.      In 1959, the Dave Brubeck Quartet recorded  Time Out , an album about which the record label was enthusiastic but which they were nonetheless hesitant to release. Featuring the cover art of  |S._Neil_Fujita|S._Neil_Fujita| , the album contained all original compositions, almost none of which were in  |common_time|Common_Time| , , , and  were used, inspired by Eurasian folk music they experienced during their 1958 Department of State sponsored tour.  Nonetheless, on the strength of these unusual time signatures , it quickly went  |Platinum|Platinum_Album| . It was the first jazz album to sell more than a million copies.      Time Out was followed by several albums with a similar approach, including  Time Further Out: Miro Reflections  , using more , , and , plus the first attempt at ;  Countdown—Time in Outer Space  , featuring  and more ;  Time Changes  , with much ,  , and ; and  Time In  .     These albums were also known for using contemporary paintings as cover art, featuring the work of  |Joan_Miró|Joan_Miró|  on Time Further Out,  |Franz_Kline|Franz_Kline|  on Time in Outer Space, and  |Sam_Francis|Sam_Francis|  on Time Changes.     On a handful of albums in the early 1960s, clarinetist  |Bill_Smith|Bill_Smith|  replaced Desmond. These albums were devoted to Smiths compositions and thus had a somewhat different aesthetic than other Brubeck Quartet albums. Nonetheless, according to critic Ken Dryden, proves himself very much in Desmonds league with his witty solos.  Smith was an old friend of Brubecks; they would record together, intermittently, from the 1940s until the final years of Brubecks career.     In the early 1960s, Brubeck and his wife Iola developed a jazz musical,  The Real Ambassadors , based in part on experiences they and their colleagues had during foreign tours on behalf of the Department of State. The soundtrack album, which featured  |Louis_Armstrong|Louis_Armstrong| ,  |Lambert,_Hendricks_&_Ross|Lambert,_Hendricks_&_Ross| , and  |Carmen_McRae|Carmen_Mcrae|  was recorded in 1961; the musical was performed at the 1962  |Monterey_Jazz_Festival|Monterey_Jazz_Festival| .     At its peak in the early 1960s, the Brubeck Quartet was releasing as many as four albums a year. Apart from the College and the Time series, Brubeck recorded four  |LPs|Lp_Album|  featuring his compositions based on the groups travels, and the local music they encountered.  Jazz Impressions of the U.S.A.  , Jazz Impressions of Eurasia ,  Jazz Impressions of Japan  , and  Jazz Impressions of New York  are less well-known albums, but all are brilliant examples of the quartets studio work, and they produced Brubeck standards such as Summer Song , Brandenburg Gate , Koto Song , and Theme From Mr. Broadway .  In 1961, Brubeck appeared in a few scenes of the British jazz/beat film  All Night Long , which starred  |Patrick_McGoohan|Patrick_Mcgoohan|  and  |Richard_Attenborough|Richard_Attenborough| . Brubeck merely plays himself, with the film featuring  |close-ups|Close-Up|  of his piano fingerings. Brubeck performs Its a Raggy Waltz from the Time Further Out album and duets briefly with bassist  |Charles_Mingus|Charles_Mingus|  in Non-Sectarian Blues .     In the early 1960s Dave Brubeck was the program director of WJZZ-FM radio . He achieved his vision of an all-jazz format radio station along with his friend and neighbor John E. Metts, one of the first African Americans in senior radio management. The final studio album for Columbia by the Desmond/Wright/Morello quartet was Anything Goes featuring the songs of  |Cole_Porter|Cole_Porter| . A few concert recordings followed, and The Last Time We Saw Paris was the Classic Quartets swan-song.                         Brubeck produced The Gates of Justice in 1968, a  |cantata|Cantata|  mixing  |Biblical_scripture|Biblical_Scripture|  with the words of Dr.  |Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.|Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.|  The new senior management at Columbia Records decided not to renew Brubecks contract in 1971, as they wished to focus on rock music. He moved to Atlantic Records.  His music was used in the 1985 film  Ordeal by Innocence . He also composed for – and performed with his ensemble on – The NASA Space Station , a 1988 episode of the CBS TV series  This Is America, Charlie Brown .              Dave Brubeck married jazz lyricist Iola Whitlock in September 1942, remaining married for 70 years up until his death. Iola died on March 12, 2014, from cancer in  |Wilton,_Connecticut|Wilton,_Connecticut| , at the age of 90. , recordnet.com; accessed March 14, 2014.

Dan is a percussionist, Chris is a multi-instrumentalist and composer.  |Matthew|Matt_Brubeck| , the youngest, is a  |cellist|Cellist|  with an extensive list of composing and performance credits. Another son, Michael, died in 2009.  Brubecks children often joined him in concerts and in the recording studio.     Brubeck became a Catholic in 1980, shortly after completing the Mass To Hope which had been commissioned by Ed Murray, editor of the national Catholic weekly  Our Sunday Visitor . Although he had spiritual interests before that time, he said, I didnt convert to Catholicism, because I wasnt anything to convert from. I just joined the Catholic Church. , PBS In 1996, he received the  |Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award|Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award| .

Brubeck founded the Brubeck Institute with his wife, Iola, at their alma mater, the  |University_of_the_Pacific|University_Of_The_Pacific|  in 2000. What began as a special archive, consisting of the personal document collection of the Brubecks, has since expanded to provide fellowships and educational opportunities in jazz for students, also leading to having one of the main streets on which the school resides named in his honor, Dave Brubeck Way.           The  |main-belt|Asteroid_Belt| |asteroid|Asteroid| |5079_Brubeck|5079_Brubeck|  was named after Brubeck.      Brubeck recorded five of the seven tracks of his album Jazz Goes to College in Ann Arbor. He returned to Michigan many times, including a performance at Hill Auditorium where he received a Distinguished Artist Award from the  |University_of_Michigans|University_Of_Michigan|  Musical Society in 2006.

A memorial tribute was held in May 2013.      The  Los Angeles Times  noted that he was one of Jazzs first pop stars, even though he was not always happy with his fame. He felt uncomfortable, for example, that  Time  had featured him on the cover ,  Time , November 8, 1954.   before it did so for  |Duke_Ellington|Duke_Ellington| , saying, It just bothered me.   The New York Times  noted he had continued to play well into his old age, performing in 2011 and in 2010 only a month after getting a  |pacemaker|Artificial_Cardiac_Pacemaker| , with Times music writer Nate Chinen commenting that Brubeck had replaced the old hammer-and-anvil attack with something almost airy and that his playing at the  |Blue_Note_Jazz_Club|Blue_Note_Jazz_Club|  in New York City was the picture of judicious clarity .      In The Daily Telegraph, music journalist Ivan Hewett wrote: Brubeck didnt have the réclame of some jazz musicians who lead tragic lives. He didnt do drugs or drink. What he had was endless curiosity combined with stubbornness, adding, His work list is astonishing, including oratorios, musicals and concertos, as well as hundreds of jazz compositions. This quiet man of jazz was truly a marvel.      In The Guardian, John Fordham said Brubecks real achievement was to blend European compositional ideas, very demanding rhythmic structures, jazz song-forms and improvisation in expressive and accessible ways. His son Chris told The Guardian when I hear Chorale, it reminds me of the very best  |Aaron_Copland|Aaron_Copland| , something like Appalachian Spring. Theres a sort of American honesty to it.   |Robert_Christgau|Robert_Christgau|  dubbed Brubeck the jazz hero of the rock and roll generation .       The Economist  wrote: Above all they found it hard to believe that the most successful jazz in America was being played by a family man, a laid-back Californian, modest, gentle and open, who would happily have been a rancher all his days—except that he couldnt live without performing, because the rhythm of jazz, under all his extrapolation and exploration, was, he had discovered, the rhythm of his heart.      The Concord Boulevard Park in his hometown of Concord, California, was renamed to Dave Brubeck Memorial Park in his honor. Mayor Dan Helix favorably recalled one of his performances at the park, saying He will be with us forever because his music will never die.
