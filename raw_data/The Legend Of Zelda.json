Fairies can be kept in bottles and act as extra lives, reviving the player if they run out of hearts. Players are able to extend their life meter by finding heart-shaped crystals called Heart Containers . Full heart containers are usually received at the end of dungeons and dropped by the dungeon boss. Smaller Pieces of Heart are awarded for completing certain side quests or found hidden around the game world in various places, and require a certain number to form a full heart container.     The games pioneered a number of features that were to become industry standards. The original Legend of Zelda was the first console game with a save function that enabled players to stop playing and then resume later.

However, because the Triforce has no will of its own and it can not judge between good and evil, it will grant any wish indiscriminately.   Because of this, it was placed within an alternate world called the Sacred Realm or the Golden Land until one worthy of its power and has balanced virtues of Power, Wisdom, and Courage in their heart could obtain it, in its entirety. If a person is not of a balanced heart, the triforce part that the user mostly believes in will stay with that person and the remainder will seek out others. In order to master and control the triforce as a whole, the user must get the other parts found in other individuals and bring them together to reunite them. The Sacred Realm can itself be affected by the heart of those who enters it: those who are pure will make it a paradise, while those who are evil will transform it into a dark realm.      In Skyward Sword, the Triforce was sought by a demon king named Demise,  and after a long battle, Demise was sealed away within the Temple of the goddess Hylia, guardian of the Triforce.  Hylia, placing the Hylians on a floating island in the sky to protect them, orchestrated a means to stop the demon from escaping: creating the Goddess Sword for her chosen hero  and discarding her divinity to be reborn among the people of Skyloft.  In time, Zelda and Link enacted the goddess plan and Demise was destroyed. However, Demise vowed that his rage would be reborn and forever plague those descended from Link and Zelda.
