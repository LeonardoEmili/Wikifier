   Cecil Louis Troughton Smith , known by his pen name Cecil Scott C. S. Forester, was an English novelist known for writing tales of naval warfare, such as the 12-book  |Horatio_Hornblower|Horatio_Hornblower|  series depicting a Royal Navy officer during the  |Napoleonic_wars|Napoleonic_Wars| . The Hornblower novels  A Ship of the Line  and  Flying Colours  were jointly awarded the  |James_Tait_Black_Memorial_Prize|James_Tait_Black_Memorial_Prize|  for fiction in 1938. His other works include  The African Queen  .          Forester was born in  |Cairo|Cairo|  and, after a family breakup at an early age, moved with his mother to London where he was educated at  |Alleyns_School|Alleyns_School|  and  |Dulwich_College|Dulwich_College| . He began to study medicine at  |Guys_Hospital|Guys_Hospital|  but left without completing his degree. Forester wore glasses and was of slender physique; he failed his Army physical and was told that there was no chance that he would be accepted, even though he was of good height and somewhat athletic. He began writing seriously around 1921 using his pen name.       Forester moved to the United States during the Second World War, where he worked for the  |British_Ministry_of_Information|Ministry_Of_Information|  and wrote propaganda to encourage the US to join the  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii| . He eventually settled in  |Berkeley,_California|Berkeley,_California| . He met  |Roald_Dahl|Roald_Dahl|  in 1942 while living in  |Washington,_D.C.|Washington,_D.C.| , and Forester encouraged him to write about his experiences in the  |RAF|Royal_Air_Force| . Sturrock, Donald . Storyteller: The Life of Roald Dahl. p. 168. Harper Collins. Retrieved 28 October 2012 According to Dahls autobiography Lucky Break, Forester asked him about his experiences as a fighter pilot, and this prompted Dahl to write his first story A Piece of Cake .               Forester wrote many novels, but he is best known for the 12-book  |Horatio_Hornblower|Horatio_Hornblower|  series depicting a Royal Navy officer during the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| . He began the series with Hornblower fairly high in rank in the first novel that he wrote, which was published in 1937. But high demand for more stories led him to fill in Hornblowers life story, and he wrote novels detailing his rise from the rank of midshipman. The last completed novel was published in 1962. Hornblowers fictional feats were based on real events, but Forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history, so that Hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval battle occurs during the Napoleonic Wars.     Foresters other novels include  The African Queen  and  The General  ;  |Peninsular_War|Peninsular_War|  novels in  Death to the French   and  The Gun  ; and seafaring stories that did not involve Hornblower, such as  Brown on Resolution  ,  The Captain from Connecticut  ,  The Ship  , and  Hunting the Bismarck  , which was used as the basis of the screenplay for the film  Sink the Bismarck!  . Several of his works were filmed, including  The African Queen  , directed by  |John_Huston|John_Huston| . Forester is also credited as story writer for several movies not based on his published fiction, including  Commandos Strike at Dawn  .     He wrote several volumes of short stories set during the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| . Those in The Nightmare were based on events in  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| , ending at the  |Nuremberg_trials|Nuremberg_Trials| . Stories in The Man in the Yellow Raft followed the career of the destroyer USS Boon, while many of those in Gold from Crete followed the destroyer HMS Apache. The last of the stories in Gold from Crete was If Hitler had invaded England , which offers an imagined sequence of events starting with  |Hitlers|Adolf_Hitler|  attempt to implement  |Operation_Sea_Lion|Operation_Sea_Lion| , and culminating in the early military defeat of Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941. His non-fiction seafaring works include The Age of Fighting Sail , an account of the sea battles between Great Britain and the United States in the  |War_of_1812|War_Of_1812| .     Forester also published the crime novels  Payment Deferred  and Plain Murder , as well as two childrens books. Poo-Poo and the Dragons was created as a series of stories told to his son George to encourage him to finish his meals. George had mild food allergies which kept him feeling unwell, and he needed encouragement to eat. Poo-Poo and the DragonsThe Barbary Pirates is a childrens history of early 19th-century pirates.     Forester appeared as a contestant on the television quiz program  You Bet Your Life  hosted by  |Groucho_Marx|Groucho_Marx| , in an episode broadcast on 1 November 1956.  A previously unknown novel of Foresters entitled The Pursued was discovered in 2003 and published by  |Penguin_Classics|Penguin_Classics|  on 3 November 2011.         He married Kathleen Belcher in 1926 and they had two sons, John and George Forester. The couple divorced in 1945.
