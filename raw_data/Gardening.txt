         Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of  |horticulture|Horticulture| . In gardens,  |ornamental_plants|Ornamental_Plant|  are often grown for their  |flowers|Flower| ,  |foliage|Leaf| , or overall appearance; useful plants, such as  |root_vegetables|List_Of_Root_Vegetables| ,  |leaf_vegetables|Leaf_Vegetable| ,  |fruits|Fruit| , and  |herbs|Herb| , are grown for consumption, for use as  |dyes|Dye| , or for  |medicinal|Medicine|  or  |cosmetic|Cosmetics|  use. Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.     Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of  |shrubs|Shrub| ,  |trees|Tree| , and  |herbaceous_plants|Herbaceous_Plant| , to residential  |back_gardens|Back_Garden|  including lawns and foundation plantings, and to  |container_gardens|Container_Garden|  grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from  |farming|Agriculture|  or  |forestry|Forestry| .                  |Forest_gardening|Forest_Gardening| , a forest-based food production system, is the worlds oldest form of gardening.  Forest gardens originated in  |prehistoric_times|Prehistory|  along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of  |monsoon|Monsoon|  regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually foreign species were also selected and incorporated into the gardens.      After the emergence of the first  |civilizations|Civilization| , wealthy individuals began to create gardens for aesthetic purposes.  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ian tomb paintings from the  |New_Kingdom|New_Kingdom|  provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental  |horticulture|Horticulture|  and landscape design; they depict  |lotus|Egyptian_Lotus|  ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of  |acacias|Acacia|  and  |palms|Palm_Tree| . A notable example of ancient ornamental gardens were the  |Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon|Hanging_Gardens_Of_Babylon| —one of the  |Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World|Seven_Wonders_Of_The_Ancient_World|  —while  |ancient_Rome|Ancient_Rome|  had dozens of gardens.     Wealthy ancient Egyptians used gardens for providing shade. Egyptians associated trees and gardens with gods, believing that their deities were pleased by gardens. Gardens in ancient Egypt were often surrounded by walls with trees planted in rows. Among the most popular species planted were  |date_palms|Date_Palms| , sycamores,  |fir_trees|Ficus| , nut trees, and  |willows|Willows| . These gardens were a sign of higher socioeconomic status. In addition, wealthy ancient Egyptians grew vineyards, as wine was a sign of the higher social classes.  |Roses|Rose| , poppies,  |daisies|Asteraceae|  and  |irises|Iris|  could all also be found in the gardens of the Egyptians.      |Assyria|Assyria|  was also renowned for its beautiful gardens. These tended to be wide and large, some of them used for hunting game—rather like a game reserve today—and others as leisure gardens.  |Cypresses|Cupressus|  and palms were some of the most frequently planted types of trees.      |Ancient_Roman|Ancient_Roman|  gardens were laid out with hedges and vines and contained a wide variety of flowers— |acanthus|Acanthus| ,  |cornflowers|Cornflowers| ,  |crocus|Crocus| ,  |cyclamen|Cyclamen| , hyacinth, iris, ivy,  |lavender|Lavender| , lilies, myrtle, narcissus, poppy,  |rosemary|Rosemary|  and violets  —as well as statues and sculptures. Flower beds were popular in the courtyards of rich Romans.          The  |Middle_Age|Middle_Age|  represented a period of decline in gardens for aesthetic purposes, with regard to gardening. After the fall of Rome, gardening was done for the purpose of growing  |medicinal_herbs|Medicinal_Herbs|  and/or decorating church  |altars|Altars| . Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe.   Generally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a green court , a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarers garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.      |Islamic_gardens|Islamic_Garden|  were built after the model of  |Persian_gardens|Persian_Gardens|  and they were usually enclosed by walls and divided in four by watercourses. Commonly, the centre of the garden would have a  |reflecting_pool|Reflecting_Pool|  or  |pavilion|Pavilion| . Specific to the Islamic gardens are the  |mosaics|Mosaics|  and glazed tiles used to decorate the rills and  |fountains|Fountain|  that were built in these gardens.     By the late 13th century, rich Europeans began to grow gardens for leisure and for medicinal herbs and vegetables. They surrounded the gardens by walls to protect them from animals and to provide  |seclusion|Seclusion| . During the next two centuries, Europeans started planting lawns and raising flowerbeds and trellises of roses. Fruit trees were common in these gardens and also in some, there were turf seats. At the same time, the gardens in the  |monasteries|Monasteries|  were a place to grow flowers and medicinal herbs but they were also a space where the  |monks|Monks|  could enjoy nature and relax.     The gardens in the 16th and 17th century were  |symmetric|Symmetric| , proportioned and balanced with a more classical appearance. Most of these gardens were built around a central axis and they were divided into different parts by hedges. Commonly, gardens had flowerbeds laid out in squares and separated by gravel paths.     Gardens in Renaissance were adorned with sculptures,  |topiary|Topiary|  and fountains. In the 17th century,  |knot_gardens|Knot_Garden|  became popular along with the  |hedge_mazes|Hedge_Maze| . By this time, Europeans started planting new flowers such as  |tulips|Tulips| , marigolds and  |sunflowers|Sunflowers| .           |Cottage_gardens|Cottage_Garden| , which emerged in  |Elizabethan_times|Elizabethan_Era| , appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.  One theory is that they arose out of the  |Black_Death|Black_Death|  of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.  According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,  |Anne_Scott_James|Anne_Scott_James| , The Cottage Garden 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured  |topiary|Topiary|  among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century. these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted among them for decoration. Farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden—about —where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens. A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, Howard Colvin,  |Yale_University_Press|Yale_University_Press| , 2008   ,      Authentic gardens of the  |yeoman_cottager|Yeoman|  would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor ;  |calendulas|Calendula|  and  |primroses|Primula_Vulgaris|  were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as  |sweet_William|Dianthus_Barbatus|  and  |hollyhocks|Hollyhock| , were grown entirely for their beauty.           In the 18th century gardens were laid out more naturally, without any walls. This style of smooth undulating grass, which would run straight to the house, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a gardenless form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. The  |English_landscape_garden|English_Landscape_Garden|  usually included a lake, lawns set against groves of trees, and often contained shrubberies, grottoes, pavilions, bridges and  |follies|Folly|  such as mock temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. This new style emerged in  |England|England|  in the early 18th century, and spread across  |Europe|Europe| , replacing the more formal, symmetrical  |garden_à_la_française|Garden_À_La_Française|  of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe. Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, LArt des jardins en Europe, Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. They were often inspired by paintings of landscapes by  |Claude_Lorraine|Claude_Lorraine|  and  |Nicolas_Poussin|Nicolas_Poussin| , and some were Influenced by the classic  |Chinese_gardens|Chinese_Gardens|  of the East, which had recently been described by European travelers.  The work of  |Lancelot_Capability_Brown|Capability_Brown|  was particularly influential. Also, in 1804 the Horticultural Society was formed.     Gardens of the 19th century contained plants such as the monkey puzzle or Chile pine. This is also the time when the so-called  |gardenesque|Gardenesque|  style of gardens evolved. These gardens displayed a wide variety of flowers in a rather small space.  |Rock_gardens|Rock_Garden|  increased in popularity in the 19th century.                   Residential gardening takes place near the home, in a space referred to as the garden. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located  |on_a_roof|Roof_Garden| , in an  |atrium|Atrium| , on a  |balcony|Balcony| , in a  |windowbox|Windowbox| ,  |on_a_patio|Patio|  or  |vivarium|Vivarium| .     Gardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ,  |amusement_parks|Amusement_Park| , along transportation corridors, and around  |tourist_attractions|Tourism|  and  |garden_hotels|Garden_Hotels| . In these situations, a staff of gardeners or  |groundskeepers|Groundskeeper|  maintains the gardens.   Indoor gardening is concerned with the growing of  |houseplants|Houseplant|  within a residence or building, in a  |conservatory|Conservatory| , or in a  |greenhouse|Greenhouse| . Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated as part of  |air_conditioning|Air_Conditioning|  or heating systems. Indoor gardening extends the growing season in the fall and spring and can be used for  |winter_gardening|Winter_Gardening| .    |Native_plant_gardening|Native_Plant_Gardening|  is concerned with the use of  |native_plants|Native_Plants|  with or without the intent of creating  |wildlife_habitat|Wildlife_Habitat| . The goal is to create a garden in harmony with, and adapted to a given area. This type of gardening typically reduces water usage, maintenance, and fertilization costs, while increasing  |native_fauna|Native_Fauna| l interest.    |Water_garden|Water_Garden| ing is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and ponds.  |Bog_gardens|Bog_Garden|  are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plant. In  |aquascaping|Aquascaping| , a garden is created within an  |aquarium|Aquarium|  tank.    |Container_garden|Container_Garden| ing is concerned with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are pots,  |hanging_baskets|Hanging_Basket| , and planters. Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.    |Hügelkultur|Hügelkultur|  is concerned with growing plants on piles of rotting wood, as a form of  |raised_bed_gardening|Raised_Bed_Gardening|  and composting  |in_situ|In_Situbiology| .  An English  |loanword|Loanword|  from German, it means mound garden.  |Toby_Hemenway|Toby_Hemenway| , noted  |permaculture|Permaculture|  author and teacher, considers wood buried in trenches to also be a form of hugelkultur referred to as a dead wood  |swale|Swale| . Hemenway, Toby . Gaias Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture. Chelsea Green Publishing. pp. 84-85. . Hugelkultur is practiced by  |Sepp_Holzer|Sepp_Holzer|  as a method of  |forest_gardening|Forest_Gardening|  and  |agroforestry|Agroforestry| , and by  |Geoff_Lawton|Geoff_Lawton|  as a method of  |dryland_farming|Dryland_Farming|  and  |desert_greening|Desert_Greening| .  When used as a method of disposing of large volumes of waste wood and woody debris, hugelkultur accomplishes  |carbon_sequestration|Carbon_Sequestration| . It is also a form of  |xeriscaping|Xeriscaping| .    |Community_gardening|Community_Gardening|  is a social activity in which an area of land is gardened by a group of people, providing access to fresh produce and plants as well as access to satisfying labor, neighborhood improvement, sense of community and connection to the environment.  Hannah, A. K. & Oh, P. Rethinking Urban Poverty: A look at Community Gardens. Bulletin of Science, Technology and & Society. 20. 207-216. Community gardens are typically owned in trust by local governments or nonprofits. Ferris, J., Norman, C. & Sempik, J. People, Land and Sustainability: Community Gardens and the Social Dimension of Sustainable Development. Social Policy and Administration. 35. 559-568.    |Garden_sharing|Garden_Sharing|  partners landowners with gardeners in need of land. These shared gardens, typically front or back  |yards|Yard| , are usually used to produce food that is divided between the two parties.    |Organic_gardening|Organic_Horticulture|  uses natural, sustainable methods, fertilizers and pesticides to grow non- |genetically_modified_crops|Genetically_Modified_Crops| .       People can express their political or social views in gardens, intentionally or not. The lawn vs. garden issue is played out in  |urban_planning|Urban_Planning|  as the debate over the  |land_ethic|Land_Ethic|  that is to determine urban  |land_use|Land_Use|  and whether hyper  |hygienist|Hygiene| |bylaws|Bylaw|   should apply, or whether land should generally be allowed to exist in its natural wild state. In a famous  |Canadian|Canadians| |_Charter_of_Rights|Canadian_Charter_Of_Rights_And_Freedoms|  case, Sandra Bell vs. City of Toronto , 1997, the right to cultivate all native species, even most varieties deemed noxious or allergenic, was upheld as part of the  |right_of_free_expression|Freedom_Of_Speech| .      |Community_gardening|Community_Gardening|  comprises a wide variety of approaches to sharing land and gardens.        People often surround their house and garden with a hedge. Common hedge plants are  |privet|Privet| ,  |hawthorn|Crataegus| ,  |beech|Beech| ,  |yew|Taxus| ,  |leyland_cypress|Leyland_Cypress| ,  |hemlock|Tsuga| ,  |arborvitae|Thuja_Occidentalis| ,  |barberry|Berberis| ,  |box|Buxus| ,  |holly|Holly| ,  |oleander|Nerium_Oleander| ,  |forsythia|Forsythia|  and  |lavender|Lavender| . The idea of open gardens without hedges may be distasteful to those who enjoy privacy.   The  |Slow_Food|Slow_Food|  movement has sought in some countries to add an edible  |school_yard|School_Garden|  and garden classrooms to schools, e.g. in  |Fergus_Ontario|Fergus_Ontario| , where these were added to a public school to augment the kitchen classroom.  |Garden_sharing|Garden_Sharing| , where urban landowners allow gardeners to grow on their property in exchange for a share of the harvest, is associated with the desire to control the quality of ones food, and reconnect with soil and community.  The Guardian, 4 September 2008     In US and British usage, the production of ornamental plantings around buildings is called  landscaping ,  landscape maintenance  or grounds keeping, while international usage uses the term gardening for these same activities.     Also gaining popularity is the concept of Green Gardening which involves growing plants using organic fertilizers and pesticides so that the gardening process – or the flowers and fruits produced thereby – doesnt adversely affect the environment or peoples health in any manner.          Gardening for beauty is likely nearly as old as farming for food, however for most of history for the majority of people there was no real distinction since the need for food and other useful products trumped other concerns. Small-scale,  |subsistence_agriculture|Subsistence_Agriculture|   is largely indistinguishable from gardening. A patch of potatoes grown by a Peruvian peasant or an Irish smallholder for personal use could be described as either a garden or a farm. Gardening for average people evolved as a separate discipline, more concerned with aesthetics,  |recreation|Recreation|  and  |leisure|Leisure| ,        under the influence of the pleasure gardens of the wealthy. Meanwhile, farming has evolved in the direction of  |commercialization|Commercial_Agriculture| ,  |economics_of_scale|Economics_Of_Scale| , and  |monocropping|Monocropping| .     In respect to its food-producing purpose, gardening is distinguished from  |farming|Agriculture|  chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, and with the production of salable goods as a major motivation. Gardening happens on a smaller scale, primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardeners own family or community. There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called  |market_gardening|Market_Gardening| , can fit in either category.     The key distinction between gardening and farming is essentially one of scale; gardening can be a hobby or an income supplement, but farming is generally understood as a full-time or commercial activity, usually involving more land and quite different practices. One distinction is that gardening is labor-intensive and employs very little  |infrastructural_capital|Infrastructural_Capital| , sometimes no more than a few tools, e.g. a  |spade|Spade| ,  |hoe|Hoe| ,  |basket|Basket|  and  |watering_can|Watering_Can| . By contrast, larger-scale farming often involves  |irrigation_systems|Irrigation| , chemical  |fertilizers|Fertilizer|  and  |harvesters|Combine_Harvester|  or at least  |ladders|Ladder| , e.g. to reach up into  |fruit_trees|Fruit_Tree| . However, this distinction is becoming blurred with the increasing use of power tools in even small gardens.      |Monty_Don|Monty_Don|  has speculated on an atavistic connection between present-day gardeners and pre-modern  |peasantry|Peasantry| .          The term  |precision_agriculture|Precision_Agriculture|  is sometimes used to describe gardening using  |intermediate_technology|Appropriate_Technology|  , especially of  |organic_varieties|Organic_Farming| . Gardening is effectively scaled up to feed entire villages of over 100 people from specialized plots. A variant is the  |community_garden|Community_Gardening|  which offers plots to urban dwellers; see further in  |allotment_|Allotment| .             There is a wide range of  |garden_ornaments|Garden_Ornament|  and accessories available in the market for both the professional gardener and the amateur to exercise their creativity. These are used to add decoration or functionality, and may be made from a wide range of materials such as copper, stone, wood, bamboo,  |stainless_steel|Stainless_Steel| ,  |clay|Clay| ,  |stained_glass|Stained_Glass| , concrete, or iron. Examples include  |trellis|Trellis| ,  |garden_furniture|Garden_Furniture| ,  |statues|Garden_Sculpture| ,  |outdoor_fireplaces|Outdoor_Fireplace| ,  |fountains|Fountain| ,  |rain_chains|Rain_Chain| ,  |urns|Urns| ,  |bird_baths|Bird_Bath|  and  |feeders|Bird_Feeder| ,  |wind_chimes|Wind_Chime| , and garden lighting such as candle  |lanterns|Lanterns|  and  |oil_lamps|Oil_Lamps| . The use of these items can be part of the expression of a gardeners gardening personality.           |Garden_design|Garden_Design|  is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means garden maintenance. Garden design can include different themes such as perennial,  |butterfly|Butterfly_Gardening| ,  |wildlife|Wildlife_Garden| ,  |Japanese|Japanese_Garden| ,  |water|Water_Garden| ,  |tropical|Tropical_Garden| , or  |shade|Shade_Garden|  gardens.     In Japan,  |Samurai|Samurai|  and  |Zen_monks|Zen|  were often required to build decorative gardens or practice related skills like  |flower_arrangement|Floristry|  known as  ikebana . In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into  |formal_gardens|Garden_Design|  or landscaped park lands, such as at  |Versailles|Palace_Of_Versailles| , France, or  |Stowe|Stowe_Buckinghamshire| , England. Today,  |landscape_architects|Landscape_Architect|  and  |garden_designers|Garden_Designer|  continue to produce artistically creative designs for private garden spaces. In the US, professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers.        Garden pests are generally  |plants|Plant| ,  |fungi|Fungus| , or  |animals|Animal|   that engage in activity that the gardener considers undesirable. A pest may crowd out desirable plants, disturb soil, stunt the growth of young seedlings, steal or damage fruit, or otherwise kill plants, hamper their growth, damage their appearance, or reduce the quality of the edible or ornamental portions of the plant.  |Aphids|Aphid| ,  |spider_mites|Spider_Mite| ,  |slugs|Slug| ,  |snails|Snail| ,  |ants|Ant| ,  |birds|Bird| , and even  |cats|Cat|  are commonly considered to be garden pests.        Because gardeners may have different goals, organisms considered garden pests vary from gardener to gardener.  Tropaeolum speciosum , for example, may be considered a desirable and ornamental garden plant, or it may be considered a pest if it  |seeds|Seed|  and starts to grow where it is not wanted. As another example, in  |lawns|Lawn| , moss can become dominant and be impossible to eradicate. In some lawns,  |lichens|Lichen| , especially very damp lawn lichens such as  Peltigera lactucfolia and P. membranacea, can become difficult to control and are considered pests.       There are many ways by which unwanted pests are removed from a garden. The techniques vary depending on the pest, the gardeners goals, and the gardeners philosophy. For example, snails may be dealt with through the use of a chemical pesticide, an organic pesticide, hand-picking, barriers, or simply growing snail-resistant plants.      |Pest_control|Pest_Control|  is often done through the use of  |pesticides|Pesticides| , which may be either  |organic|Organic_Agriculture|  or artificially synthesized. Pesticides may affect the  |ecology|Ecology|  of a garden due to their effects on the populations of both target and non-target species. For example, unintended exposure to some  |neonicotinoid|Neonicotinoid|  pesticides has been proposed as a factor in the recent decline in  |honey_bee|Honey_Bee|  populations.  A mole vibrator can deter mole activity in a garden.      Other means of control include the removal of infected plants, using fertilizers and biostimulants to improve the health and vigour of plants so they better resist attack, practising  |crop_rotation|Crop_Rotation|  to prevent pest build-up, using  |companion_planting|Companion_Planting| ,  and practising good garden hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and clearing debris and  |weeds|Weed|  which may harbour pests.                |Garden_guns|Garden_Guns|  are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire  |_22_caliber|_22_Caliber| |_snake_shot|Snake_Shot| , and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. Garden guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past  to , and theyre relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure  |livestock|Livestock|  with a  |ricochet|Ricochet| . They are also used for pest control at  |airports|Airport| ,  |warehouses|Warehouse| ,  |stockyards|Meat_Packing_Industry| , etc.
