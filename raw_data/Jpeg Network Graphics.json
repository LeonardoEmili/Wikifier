JNG files embed an 8-bit or 12-bit JPEG datastream in order to store color data, and may embed another datastream for transparency information. However, a JNG may contain two separate JPEG datastreams for color information  to permit decoders that are unable to handle 12-bit datastreams to display the 8-bit datastream instead, if one is present.     Version 1.0 of the JNG specification was released on January 31, 2001 . Usually, all the applications supporting the MNG file format can handle JNG files too. For example, ": null

This way, users can benefit from the power of JPEG compression while preserving lossless transparency information.
