Warner Bros. fast-tracked development for Batman & Robin following the box office success of Batman Forever. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on  A Time to Kill , while  |Val_Kilmer|Val_Kilmer|  decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with  The Saint . Schumacher had a strong interest in casting  |William_Baldwin|William_Baldwin|  in Kilmers place before George Clooney won the role.  |Principal_photography|Principal_Photography|  began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the  |shooting_schedule|Shooting_Schedule| .     Batman & Robin premiered in Los Angeles on June 12, 1997, and went into general release on June 20. Making $238.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $160 million,  the film was critically panned and often ranks among the  |worst_films_of_all_time|List_Of_Films_Considered_The_Worst| .   It is also the lowest-grossing live-action Batman film to date.  Due to the films poor reception, Warner Bros. cancelled a sequel,  Batman Unchained ,  and  |reboot|Reboot| ed the film series with  Batman Begins  in 2005. One of the songs recorded for the film,  |The_End_Is_the_Beginning_Is_the_End|The_End_Is_The_Beginning_Is_The_End|  by  |The_Smashing_Pumpkins|The_Smashing_Pumpkins| , won a  |Grammy_Award_for_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance|  at the  |40th_Annual_Grammy_Awards|40Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards| .            Set  |two_years|Batman_Forever|  after the defeat of  |Two_Face|Two_Face|  and the  |Riddler|Riddler| ,  |Batman|Batman|  and his new partner,  |Robin|Robin| , become defenders of Gotham. They attempt to thwart the villainous  |Mr_Freeze|Mr_Freeze|  from robbing diamonds from the natural history museum, but he steals one and flees. Mr. Freeze was originally Dr. Victor Fries, a doctor working to develop a cure for MacGregors syndrome to heal his terminally ill  |wife|Nora_Fries| . Fries was forced to wear a cryogenic suit powered by diamonds after becoming unable to live at normal temperatures following a lab accident.     At a  |Wayne_Enterprises|Wayne_Enterprises|  lab in Brazil, the botanist  |Dr_Pamela_Isley|Poison_Ivy|  is working under the deranged  |Dr_Jason_Woodrue|Floronic_Man| , experimenting with the Venom drug. She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn the violent, but diminutive, convicted serial murderer Antonio Diego into a hulking monstrosity dubbed  |Bane|Bane|  . When Isley threatens to expose Woodrues experiments, he attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins. Despite Woodrues efforts, Isley is resurrected, transforming into the beautiful and seductive  |Poison_Ivy|Poison_Ivy|  before exacting revenge; she kills Woodrue with her poisonous kiss, and sets fire to the lab, leaving it to burn down while she escapes with Bane. She finds that  |Wayne_Enterprises|Wayne_Enterprises|  funded Woodrue, thus she appropriates Bane as a muscle-bound thug, taking him with her to  |Gotham_City|Gotham_City| . Meanwhile,  |Alfred_Pennyworths|Alfred_Pennyworth|  niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at  |Wayne_Manor|Wayne_Manor|  until she goes back to school.     Wayne Enterprises presents a new telescope for Gotham Observatory at a press conference interrupted by Isley. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, which would kill millions of people. Batman says that this project is in conflict with the main goals of the Wayne Corporation. That night, a charity event is held by  |Wayne_Enterprises|Wayne_Enterprises|  with special guests, Batman and Robin, and she decides to use her abilities to seduce them. Mr. Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. Although he is captured by Batman and detained in  |Arkham_Asylum|Arkham_Asylum| , he eventually  |escapes|Prison_Escape|  with the help of Poison Ivy and Bane. Meanwhile, Dick discovers that Barbara has participated in drag races to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregors syndrome.     Batman and Robin begin to have crime fighting relationship problems because of Ivys seductive ability with Robin, but Bruce eventually convinces Dick to trust him. Poison Ivy is then able to contact Robin once more; she kisses him but fails to kill him due to Robin wearing rubber lips. Robin says that the rubber lips are immune to her charms. Meanwhile, Barbara discovers the  |Batcave|Batcave| , where an AI version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the suit and becomes  |Batgirl|Batgirl| . Ivy captures Robin, but he gets rescued by Batman, and Batgirl arrives and subdues Ivy to get eaten by her throne plant, before revealing her identity to the pair.     Batman, Robin and Batgirl decide to go after Mr. Freeze together. By the time they get to the observatory where Mr. Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane, but they eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground.     Meanwhile Batman and Mr. Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Mr. Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to thaw the city, and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Poison Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, who had informed the latter that she killed Mr. Freezes wife. However, Batman informs Mr. Freeze that she is still alive, in cryogenic slumber before being moved to  |Arkham_Asylum|Arkham_Asylum| , waiting for Mr. Freeze to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Mr. Freeze for the cure Mr. Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregors Syndrome to administer to Alfred, and Mr. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him the medicine he had developed.     Mr. Freeze is then detained in Arkham Asylum. Poison Ivy is also imprisoned in Arkham Asylum with a vengeful Mr. Freeze as her cellmate and he plans to make Poison Ivys life a living hell while staying for the attempted murder of his wife. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor and fight crime with them.        |Arnold_Schwarzenegger|Arnold_Schwarzenegger|  as  |Dr_Victor_Fries_Mr_Freeze|Mr_Freeze| |molecular_biologist|Molecular_Biology|  who suffers a terrible accident while trying to cryogenically preserve his terminally ill wife. As a result, he is transformed into a criminal forced to live in a sub-zero suit powered by diamonds.  |Patrick_Stewart|Patrick_Stewart|  was considered for the role,  before the script was rewritten to accommodate Schwarzeneggers casting.  Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier . Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role,   while his  |prosthetic_makeup|Prosthetic_Makeup|  and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day.     |George_Clooney|George_Clooney|  as  |Bruce_Wayne_Batman|Batman| |Val_Kilmer|Val_Kilmer|  decided not to reprise the role from  Batman Forever . Director Joel Schumacher admitted he had difficulty working with Kilmer on Forever. He sort of quit, Schumacher said, and we sort of fired him. Kilmer said he was not aware of the fast track production and was already committed to  The Saint  . Schumacher cast Clooney in the role because he felt the actor could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than  |Michael_Keaton|Michael_Keaton|   and Kilmer. The  |shooting_schedule|Shooting_Schedule|  allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on  ER  without any scheduling conflicts.    |Eric_Lloyd|Eric_Lloyd|  as Young Bruce Wayne    |Chris_ODonnell|Chris_Odonnell|  as  |Dick_Grayson_Robin|Dick_Grayson| |legal_ward|Ward|  to Bruce Wayne.

He later said he was courted to play  |Scarecrow|Scarecrow|  in the ultimately cancelled sequel, Batman Unchained.               With the box office success of  Batman Forever  in June 1995,  |Warner_Bros_|Warner_Bros_|  immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director  |Joel_Schumacher|Joel_Schumacher|  and writer  |Akiva_Goldsman|Akiva_Goldsman|  to reprise their duties the following August,  |Joel_Schumacher|Joel_Schumacher| , Peter MacGregor-Scott,  |Chris_ODonnell|Chris_Odonnell| ,  |Val_Kilmer|Val_Kilmer| ,  |Uma_Thurman|Uma_Thurman| ,  |John_Glover|John_Glover| , Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Part 6-Batman Unbound, 2005,  |Warner_Home_Video|Warner_Home_Video|  and decided it was best to fast-track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films.  Schumacher wanted to  |homage|Homage|  both the broad  |camp_style|Camp|  of the  |1960s_television_series|Batman|  and the work of  |Dick_Sprang|Dick_Sprang| .  The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during  |pre_production|Pre_Production|  on  A Time to Kill .  Portions of Mr. Freezes  |backstory|Backstory|  were based on the  Batman: The Animated Series  episode  |Heart_of_Ice|Heart_Of_Ice|  , written by  |Paul_Dini|Paul_Dini| .  |Paul_Dini|Paul_Dini| , Batman & Robin: The Heroes, 2005,  |Warner_Home_Video|Warner_Home_Video|  Goldsman, however, expressed concerns about the script during pre-production discussions with Schumacher.     While  |Chris_ODonnell|Chris_Odonnell|  reprises the role of  |Robin|Dick_Grayson| ,  |Val_Kilmer|Val_Kilmer|  decided not to reprise the role of Batman from Batman Forever. Schumacher admitted he had difficulty working with Kilmer on Forever. He sort of quit, Schumacher said, and we sort of fired him.  Schumacher would later go on to say that Kilmer wanted to work on Island of Doctor Moreau because  |Marlon_Brando|Marlon_Brando|  was cast in the film. Kilmer said he was not aware of the fast-track production and was already committed to  The Saint  . Schumacher originally had a strong interest in casting  |William_Baldwin|William_Baldwin|  in Kilmers place, but  |George_Clooney|George_Clooney|  was cast instead.  Schumacher believed Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than  |Michael_Keaton|Michael_Keaton|   and Kilmer.  The  |shooting_schedule|Shooting_Schedule|  allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on  ER  without any scheduling conflicts.      |Patrick_Stewart|Patrick_Stewart|  was considered for the role of  |Mr_Freeze|Mr_Freeze| , before the script was rewritten to accommodate  |Arnold_Schwarzeneggers|Arnold_Schwarzenegger|  casting.  Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier . Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role.  To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger wore a bald cap after declining to shave his head and wore a blue  |LED|Light_Emitting_Diode|  in his mouth.  His  |prosthetic_makeup|Prosthetic_Makeup|  and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day.  Thurman took the role of  |Poison_Ivy|Poison_Ivy|  because she liked the  |femme_fatale|Femme_Fatale|  characterization of the character.  |Alicia_Silverstone|Alicia_Silverstone|  was the only choice for the role of  |Batgirl|Batgirl| .     According to Schumacher, during the scene in which the costumes of the  |Riddler|Riddler|  and  |Two_Face|Two_Face|  are seen, he originally planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping from  |Arkham_Asylum|Arkham_Asylum|  while many other villains saw them from their cells. The scene, however, didnt make it in the final film.       The original start date was August 1996, but  |principal_photography|Principal_Photography|  did not begin until September 12, 1996.  Batman & Robin finished filming in late January 1997,  two weeks ahead of the  |shooting_schedule|Shooting_Schedule| . The film was mostly shot at Warner Bros. Studios in  |Burbank_California|Burbank_California| .     When comparing work on Batman Forever, ODonnell explained, It just felt like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I felt like I was making a movie. The second time, I felt like I was making a kids toy commercial. He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable than the one he wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face.  According to  |John_Glover|John_Glover| , who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, Joel would sit on a crane with a  |megaphone|Megaphone|  and yell before each  |take|Takefilm| , Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon. It was hard to act because that kind of set the tone for the film.  |Production_designer|Production_Designer|  Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the  |Gotham_City|Gotham_City|  design came from  |neon_ridden|Neon_Sign|  Tokyo and the  |Machine_Age|Machine_Age| . Gotham is like a  |Worlds_Fair|Worlds_Fair|  on  |ecstasy|Mdma| . Barbara Ling, Bigger, Bolder, Brighter: The Production Design of Batman & Robin, 2005,  |Warner_Home_Video|Warner_Home_Video| |_Rhythm_and_Hues|Rhythm_And_Hues_Studios|  and  |Pacific_Data_Images|Pacific_Data_Images|  created the visual effects sequences, with  |John_Dykstra|John_Dykstra|  and  |Andrew_Adamson|Andrew_Adamson|  credited as the  |visual_effects_supervisors|Visual_Effects_Supervisor| .  |John_Dykstra|John_Dykstra| ,  |Andrew_Adamson|Andrew_Adamson| , Freeze Frame: The Visual Effects of Batman & Robin, 2005,  |Warner_Home_Video|Warner_Home_Video|      ODonnell said that despite hanging out with Schwarzenegger a lot off set and during promotion for the film, they never worked a single day together; this was achieved with stand-ins when one of the actors was not available. Stunt coordinator Alex Field taught Silverstone to ride a motorcycle so that she could play Batgirl.            Like Batman Forever, the original score for the film was written by  |Elliot_Goldenthal|Elliot_Goldenthal| .  The soundtrack featured a variety of genres by various bands and performers, showcasing  |alternative_rock|Alternative_Rock|  on the lead single  |The_End_Is_the_Beginning_Is_the_End|The_End_Is_The_Beginning_Is_The_End|  by  |The_Smashing_Pumpkins|The_Smashing_Pumpkins| , on the  |Goo_Goo_Dolls|Goo_Goo_Dolls|  contribution,  |Lazy_Eye|Lazy_Eye|  and with  |R_E_M_s|R_E_M_|  song Revolution . R & B singer  |R_Kelly|R_Kelly|  also wrote  |Gotham_City|Gotham_City|  for the soundtrack, which became the other song featured in the end credits, as well as one of the singles, reaching the top 10 in the United States and in the UK.  |Eric_Benét|Eric_Benét|  and  |Meshell_Ndegeocello|Meshell_Ndegeocello|  also contributed R & B songs. Also included was the top 5 second single,  |Look_into_My_Eyes|Look_Into_My_Eyes|  by the  |hip_hop|Hip_Hop|  group  |Bone_Thugs_n_Harmony|Bone_Thugs_N_Harmony| . Other songs featured included  |electronic_dance|Electronic_Dance_Music|  elements, including those by  |Moloko|Moloko|  and  |Arkarna|Arkarna| . The soundtrack was released on May 27, 1997, a month before the film.      |The_End_Is_the_Beginning_Is_the_End|The_End_Is_The_Beginning_Is_The_End|  by  |The_Smashing_Pumpkins|The_Smashing_Pumpkins| , won a  |Grammy_Award_for_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance|Grammy_Award_For_Best_Hard_Rock_Performance|  at the  |40th_Annual_Grammy_Awards|40Th_Annual_Grammy_Awards| .       The Batman & Robin  |film_trailer|Trailer|  debuted on the February 19, 1997 episode of  Entertainment Tonight .   |Warner_Bros_|Warner_Bros_|  spent $125 million to market and promote the film,  in addition to its $160 million production budget. The studio also reportedly included toy companies in  |pre_production|Pre_Production|  meetings, including the design of  |concept_art|Concept_Art|  and character illustrations. Director Joel Schumacher criticized Warner Bros. strategy for Batman & Robin as being overtly  |toyetic|Toyetic| .     Various  |Six_Flags|Six_Flags|  parks  all debuted coasters themed to the film. Six Flags Great Adventure opened  |Batman_Robin_The_Chiller|Batman_Robin_The_Chiller|  in 1997, and both Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags St. Louis received  |Mr_Freeze|Mr_Freeze|  in 1998.  |Taco_Bell|Taco_Bell|  featured a promotional campaign including collectible cups and a contest with a replica of the films  |Batmobile|Batmobile|  as a grand prize. A junior novelization of the screenplay, written by  |Alan_Grant|Alan_Grant| , was published along with the release of the film in 1997.            Batman & Robin was released on June 20, 1997 in North America, earning $42,872,605 in its opening weekend,  making it the third-highest opening weekend of 1997.  The film declined by 63% in its second week.  Batman & Robin faced early competition with  Face/Off ,  Hercules , and  Men in Black .  Schumacher blamed it on  |yellow_journalism|Yellow_Journalism|  started by  |Harry_Knowles|Harry_Knowles|  of  |Aint_It_Cool_News|Aint_It_Cool_News|  and other film websites such as  |Dark_Horizons|Dark_Horizons| .  The film went on to gross $107.3 million in North America and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million. Warner Bros. acknowledged Batman & Robins shortcomings in the domestic market but pointed out success overseas.            On review aggregation website  |Rotten_Tomatoes|Rotten_Tomatoes|  the film has an approval rating of 11%, based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 3.69/10. The sites critical consensus reads, Joel Schumachers tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in Batman & Robin, resulting in a frantic and mindless movie thats too jokey to care much for.  On  |Metacritic|Metacritic| , the film has an average score of 28 out of 100, based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating generally unfavorable reviews .  Audiences polled by  |CinemaScore|Cinemascore|  gave the film an average grade of C+ on an A+ to F scale.      Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of Batman & Robin on Warner Bros. decision to fast track production. There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make Batman & Robin more  |family_friendly|Family_Friendly| , Schumacher explained. We decided to do a less depressing Batman movie, and less torture and more heroic. I know I have been criticized a lot for this, but I didnt see the harm in that approach at all.  |Roger_Ebert|Roger_Ebert|  of the  Chicago Sun-Times  criticized the  |toyetic|Toyetic|  approach and Mr. Freezes  |one_liner_jokes|One_Line_Joke|  in his two-star review of the film.   |Kenneth_Turan|Kenneth_Turan|  of the  Los Angeles Times  believed the film killed the  |Batman_film_series|Batman_In_Film| , and felt Batman & Robin depended too much on visual effects.   |Desson_Howe|Desson_Thomson|  of  The Washington Post  largely disapproved of Schumachers direction and Akiva Goldsmans script.   |Mick_LaSalle|Mick_Lasalle| , writing in the  San Francisco Chronicle , said, George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should go down in history as the  |George_Lazenby|George_Lazenby|  of the series.  However,  |Janet_Maslin|Janet_Maslin|  of  The New York Times  gave a positive review, and praised Uma Thurmans acting, as well as the production and costume design.   |Andrew_Johnston|Andrew_Johnston| , writing in  |Time_Out_New_York|Time_Out| , remarked, Its hard to tell who B & R is intended for. Anyone who knows the character from the comics or the superb animated show on Fox will be alienated. And though Schumacher treats the  |Adam_West_version|Batman|  as gospel, that shows campy humor is completely incompatible with these production values. As Mr. Freeze would say, its sure to leave audiences cold.         Batman & Robin was nominated for the  |Saturn_Award_for_Best_Fantasy_Film|Saturn_Award_For_Best_Fantasy_Film| , as well as  |Best_Make_up|Saturn_Award_For_Best_Make_Up|  and  |Best_Costume|Saturn_Award_For_Best_Costume_Design| , but won none.  |Alicia_Silverstone|Alicia_Silverstone|  won the  |Razzie_Award|Golden_Raspberry_Awards|  for Worst Supporting Actress. Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher , George Clooney and Chris ODonnell , Akiva Goldsman , both Chris ODonnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger , Uma Thurman , as well as  |Billy_Corgan|Billy_Corgan|  . Batman & Robin also received nominations for  |Worst_Picture|Golden_Raspberry_Award_For_Worst_Picture| , Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Ultimately, out of 11 nominations, Batman & Robin garnered only one Razzie Award. At the  |Stinkers_Bad_Movie_Awards|Stinkers_Bad_Movie_Awards| , the film garnered five nominations, of which it won four: Worst Picture, Worst Director , Worst Supporting Actress , and Worst Screenplay for a Film Grossing More Than $100M Worldwide Using Hollywood Math. However, it lost Worst Sequel to  Speed 2: Cruise Control .  Later, the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards unveiled their 100 Years, 100 Stinkers list which honoured the 100 worst films of the 20th century. Batman and Robin managed to rank as the 3 worst film of the century, behind  Wild Wild West  at 2 and  Battlefield Earth  at 1.          Some observers thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible  |homoerotic|Homoeroticism| |_innuendo|Innuendo|  in the storyline.  |James_Berardinelli|James_Berardinelli|  questioned the random  of rubber nipples and camera angle  |close_ups|Close_Up|  of the Dynamic Duos butts and Bat-crotches.  Los Angeles Times wrote that The addition of nipples and a  |codpiece|Codpiece|  to Batman’s costume may be the film’s lasting legacy .  Schumacher stated, I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from  |Ancient_Greek_statues|Ancient_Greek_Art| , which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct. ODonnell felt it wasnt so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didnt think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual. Clooney, who admitted to purposely taking a subtle gay approach to his portrayal, later said Joel Schumacher told me Batman was gay .  Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying in 2005, I think we might have killed the franchise ,  and called it a waste of money .           During the filming of Batman & Robin,  |Warner_Bros_|Warner_Bros_|  was impressed with the  |dailies|Dailies| , prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film. However, writer  |Akiva_Goldsman|Akiva_Goldsman|  turned down an offer to write the script. In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired  |Mark_Protosevich|Mark_Protosevich|  to write the script for a fifth Batman film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.  Los Angeles Times described their film as continuing in the same vein with multiple villains and more silliness . Titled Batman Unchained, Protosevichs script had the  |Scarecrow|Scarecrow|  as the main villain. Through the use of his fear  |toxin|Toxin| , he resurrects the  |Joker|Joker|  as a hallucination in Batmans mind.  |Harley_Quinn|Harley_Quinn|  appeared as a supporting character, written as the Jokers daughter.  Clooney, ODonnell, Silverstone, and Coolio were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and Scarecrow. It was also hoped that  |Jack_Nicholson|Jack_Nicholson|  would reprise the role of the Joker. However, following the poor critical reception of Batman & Robin, Clooney vowed never to reprise his role.      Warner Bros. decided to consider a live-action  Batman Beyond  film and an adaptation of  |Frank_Millers|Frank_Miller|   Batman: Year One . Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most. Schumacher felt he owe the Batman culture a real Batman movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight. He approached Warner Bros. about doing Batman: Year One in mid-1998,  but they were more interested in hiring  |Darren_Aronofsky|Darren_Aronofsky| . Aronofsky and Miller developed a Year One script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled.  |Christopher_Nolan|Christopher_Nolan|  was eventually hired to helm the next Batman film in January 2003, resulting in the  |reboot|Reboot| ed  Batman Begins  .        In Legends of the Dark Knight , an episode of  The New Batman Adventures , three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumachers Batman & Robin. The teens treat Joels ideas with utter disdain. Legends of the Dark Knight .  |Dan_Riba|Dan_Riba|  ,  |Bruce_Timm|Bruce_Timm| ; Robert Goodman .  Batman: The Animated Series . October 10, 1998. No. 19, season 2. In  Watchmen , director  |Zack_Snyder|Zack_Snyder|  and comic book artist  |Dave_Gibbons|Dave_Gibbons|  chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple  |Batsuit|Batsuit|  design from Batman & Robin for the  |Ozymandias|Ozymandias|  costume.   The film is referenced in the  Batman: The Brave and the Bold  episode Legends of the Dark Mite! , when  |Bat_Mite|Bat_Mite|  briefly uses his powers to transform Batmans costume into the same suit shown in the Schumacher Batman films, before declaring it Too icky .
