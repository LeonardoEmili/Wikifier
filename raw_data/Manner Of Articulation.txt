           In  |articulatory_phonetics|Articulatory_Phonetics| , the manner of articulation is the configuration and interaction of the articulators  when making a  |speech_sound|Speech_Sound| . One parameter of manner is stricture, that is, how closely the speech organs approach one another. Others include those involved in the  |r-like|Rhotic_Consonant|  sounds , and the  |sibilancy|Sibilant|  of  |fricatives|Fricative_Consonant| .     The concept of manner is mainly used in the discussion of  |consonants|Consonant| , although the movement of the articulators will also greatly alter the resonant properties of the  |vocal_tract|Vocal_Tract| , thereby changing the  |formant|Formant|  structure of speech sounds that is crucial for the identification of  |vowels|Vowel| . For consonants, the  |place_of_articulation|Place_Of_Articulation|  and the degree of  |phonation|Phonation|  of voicing are considered separately from manner, as being independent parameters.  |Homorganic_consonants|Homorganic_Consonants| , which have the same place of articulation, may have different manners of articulation. Often  |nasality|Nasalization|  and  |laterality|Lateral_Consonant|  are included in manner, but some phoneticians, such as  |Peter_Ladefoged|Peter_Ladefoged| , consider them to be independent.          Manners of articulation with substantial obstruction of the airflow are called  obstruent s. These are prototypically voiceless, but voiced obstruents are extremely common as well. Manners without such obstruction  are called  sonorant s because they are nearly always voiced. Voiceless sonorants are uncommon, but are found in Welsh and  |Classical_Greek|Classical_Greek|  , in  |Standard_Tibetan|Standard_Tibetan|  , and the wh in those dialects of English that  |distinguish_which_from_witch|Wine-Whine_Merger| .     Sonorants may also be called resonants, and some linguists prefer that term, restricting the word sonorant to non- |vocoid|Vocoid|  resonants . Another common distinction is between occlusives and continuants .         From greatest to least stricture, speech sounds may be classified along a  |cline|Wikt:Cline|  as  |stop_consonants|Stop_Consonant|  ,  |fricative_consonants|Fricative_Consonant|  ,  |approximants|Approximant|  , and  |vowels|Vowel|  .  |Affricates|Affricate|  often behave as if they were intermediate between stops and fricatives, but phonetically they are sequences of a stop and fricative.     Over time, sounds in a language may move along the cline toward less stricture in a process called  |lenition|Lenition|  or towards more stricture in a process called  |fortition|Fortition| .         Sibilants are distinguished from other fricatives by the shape of the tongue and how the airflow is directed over the teeth. Fricatives at  |coronal|Coronal_Consonant|  places of articulation may be sibilant or non-sibilant, sibilants being the more common.      |Flaps|Flap_Consonant|  are similar to very brief stops. However, their articulation and behavior are distinct enough to be considered a separate manner, rather than just  |length|Length| . The main  |articulatory|Articulation|  difference between flaps and stops is that, due to the greater length of stops compared to flaps, a build-up of air pressure occurs behind a stop which does not occur behind a flap. This means that when the stop is released, there is a burst of air as the pressure is relieved, while for flaps there is no such burst.     Trills involve the vibration of one of the speech organs. Since trilling is a separate parameter from stricture, the two may be combined. Increasing the stricture of a typical trill results in a  |trilled_fricative|Trilled_Fricative| . Trilled affricates are also known.     Nasal airflow may be added as an independent parameter to any speech sound. It is most commonly found in  |nasal_occlusives|Nasal_Occlusive|  and  |nasal_vowels|Nasal_Vowel| , but nasalized fricatives, taps, and approximants are also found. When a sound is not nasal, it is called oral.      |Laterality|Lateral_Consonant|  is the release of airflow at the side of the tongue. This can be combined with other manners, resulting in lateral approximants , lateral flaps, and lateral fricatives and affricates.          Stop , an oral occlusive, where there is occlusion of the oral  |vocal_tract|Vocal_Tract| , and no nasal air flow, so the air flow stops completely. Examples include  |English|English_Language|    and  . If the consonant is voiced, the voicing is the only sound made during occlusion; if it is voiceless, a stop is completely silent. What we hear as a /p/ or /k/ is the effect that the onset of the occlusion has on the preceding vowel, as well as the  |release|Release|  burst and its effect on the following vowel. The shape and position of the tongue  determine the  |resonant|Resonance|  cavity that gives different stops their characteristic sounds. All languages have stops.    Nasal , a nasal occlusive, where there is occlusion of the oral tract, but air passes through the nose. The shape and position of the tongue determine the resonant cavity that gives different nasals their characteristic sounds. Examples include English . Nearly all languages have nasals, the only exceptions being in the area of  |Puget_Sound|Puget_Sound|  and a single language on  |Bougainville_Island|Bougainville_Island| .    Fricative , sometimes called spirant, where there is continuous frication  at the place of articulation. Examples include English  ,  , etc. Most languages have fricatives, though many have only an . However, the  |Indigenous_Australian_languages|Indigenous_Australian_Languages|  are almost completely devoid of fricatives of any kind.    Sibilant s are a type of fricative where the airflow is guided by a groove in the tongue toward the teeth, creating a high-pitched and very distinctive sound. These are by far the most common fricatives. Fricatives at  |coronal|Coronal_Consonant|  places of articulation are usually, though not always, sibilants. English sibilants include  and .    Lateral fricatives are a rare type of fricative, where the frication occurs on one or both sides of the edge of the tongue. The ll of  |Welsh|Welsh_Phonology|  and the hl of  |Zulu|Zulu_Language|  are lateral fricatives.    Affricate , which begins like a stop, but this releases into a fricative rather than having a separate release of its own. The English letters ch  and j  represent affricates. Affricates are quite common around the world, though less common than fricatives.    Flap , often called a tap, is a momentary closure of the oral cavity. The tt of utter and the dd of udder are pronounced as a flap  in  |North_American|North_American_English|  and  |Australian_English|Australian_English| . Many linguists distinguish taps from flaps, but there is no consensus on what the difference might be. No language relies on such a difference. There are also lateral flaps.    Trill , in which the articulator is held in place, and the airstream causes it to vibrate. The double r of  |Spanish|Spanish_Language|  perro is a trill. Trills and flaps, where there are one or more brief occlusions, constitute a class of consonant called  rhotics .    Approximant , where there is very little obstruction. Examples include English  and . In some languages, such as Spanish, there are sounds that seem to fall between fricative and approximant.   One use of the word  semivowel , sometimes called a glide, is a type of approximant, pronounced like a vowel but with the tongue closer to the roof of the mouth, so that there is slight turbulence. In English,  is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel , and  is the semivowel equivalent of the vowel  in this usage. Other descriptions use semivowel for vowel-like sounds that are not syllabic, but do not have the increased stricture of approximants. These are found as elements in  |diphthongs|Diphthong| . The word may also be used to cover both concepts. The term glide is newer than semivowel, being used to indicate an essential quality of sounds such as  and , which is the movement  from their initial position  to a following vowel.    Lateral approximants, usually shortened to lateral, are a type of approximant pronounced with the side of the tongue. English  is a lateral. Together with the rhotics, which have similar behavior in many languages, these form a class of consonant called  liquids .         All of these manners of articulation are pronounced with an  |airstream_mechanism|Airstream_Mechanism|  called  |pulmonic_egressive|Pulmonic_Egressive| , meaning that the air flows outward, and is powered by the lungs . Other airstream mechanisms are possible. Sounds that rely on some of these include:      Ejective s, which are glottalic egressive. That is, the airstream is powered by an upward movement of the  |glottis|Glottis|  rather than by the lungs or diaphragm. Stops, affricates, and occasionally fricatives may occur as ejectives. All ejectives are voiceless, or at least transition from voiced to voiceless.    Implosive s, which are glottalic ingressive. Here the glottis moves downward, but the lungs may be used simultaneously , and in some languages no air may actually flow into the mouth. Implosive stops are not uncommon, but implosive affricates and fricatives are rare. Voiceless implosives are also rare.    Clicks , which are  lingual ingressive . Here the back of the tongue is used to create a vacuum in the mouth, causing air to rush in when the forward occlusion is released. Clicks may be oral or nasal, stop or affricate, central or lateral, voiced or voiceless. They are extremely rare in normal words outside  |Southern_Africa|Southern_Africa| . However, English has a click in its tsk tsk sound, and another is often used to say giddy up to a horse.   Combinations of these, in some analyses, in a single consonant:  linguo-pulmonic  and  linguo-glottalic  .
