        A spear is a  |pole_weapon|Pole_Weapon|  consisting of a shaft, usually of  |wood|Wood| , with a pointed head. The head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself, as is the case with  |fire_hardened|Fire_Hardening|  spears, or it may be made of a more durable material fastened to the shaft, such as  |flint|Flint| ,  |obsidian|Obsidian| ,  |iron|Iron| ,  |steel|Steel|  or  |bronze|Bronze| . The most common design for hunting or combat spears since ancient times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle,  |lozenge|Lozenge| , or leaf. The heads of fishing spears usually feature barbs or serrated edges.     The word  spear  comes from the  |Old_English|Old_English_Language|   spere , from the Proto-Germanic speri, from a  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European_Language|  root sper- spear, pole .   Spears can be divided into two broad categories: those designed for thrusting in  |melee|Melee_Weapon|  combat and those designed for throwing .     The spear has been used throughout human history both as a hunting and fishing tool and as a weapon. Along with the  |axe|Axe| ,  |knife|Knife|  and  |club|Club| , it is one of the earliest and most important tools developed by early humans. As a weapon, it may be wielded with either one hand or two. It was used in virtually every conflict up until the  |modern_era|Modern_Era| , where even then it continues on in the form of the  |bayonet|Bayonet| , and is probably the most commonly used weapon in history. Weir, William. 50 Weapons That Changed Warfare. The Career Press, 2005, p 12.            Spear manufacture and use is not confined to humans. It is also practiced by the  |western_chimpanzee|Western_Chimpanzee| . Chimpanzees near  |Kédougou|Kédougou| , Senegal have been observed to create spears by breaking straight limbs off trees, stripping them of their bark and side branches, and sharpening one end with their teeth. They then used the weapons to hunt  |galagos|Galago|  sleeping in hollows.                Archaeological evidence found in present-day  |Germany|Germany|  documents that wooden spears have been used for hunting since at least 400,000 years ago,  and a 2012 study from the site of  |Kathu_Pan|Kathu_Archaeological_Complex|  in South Africa suggests that hominids, possibly  Homo heidelbergensis , may have developed the technology of hafted stone-tipped spears in Africa about 500,000 years ago. Monte Morin, ,  Los Angeles Times , November 16, 2012 J. Wilkins et al. Evidence for early hafted hunting technology. Science, Vol. 338, Nov. 16, 2012, p. 942. doi:10.1126/science.1227608. Wood does not preserve well, however, and Craig Stanford, a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the  |University_of_Southern_California|University_Of_Southern_California| , has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees probably means that early humans used wooden spears as well, perhaps, five million years ago. Rick Weiss, ,  The Washington Post , February 22, 2007      |Neanderthals|Neanderthals|  were constructing stone spear heads from as early as 300,000  |BP|Before_Present|  and by 250,000 years ago, wooden spears were made with  |fire-hardened|Fire_Hardening|  points.     From circa 200,000 BCE onwards, Middle  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  humans began to make complex stone blades with flaked edges which were used as spear heads. These stone heads could be fixed to the spear shaft by gum or resin or by bindings made of animal sinew, leather strips or vegetable matter. During this period, a clear difference remained between spears designed to be thrown and those designed to be used in hand-to-hand combat. By the  |Magdalenian|Magdalenian|  period , spear-throwers similar to the later  |atlatl|Atlatl|  were in use.                                The spear is the main weapon of the warriors of  |Homers|Homer| |Iliad|Iliad| . The use of both a single thrusting spear and two throwing spears are mentioned. It has been suggested that two styles of combat are being described; an early style, with thrusting spears, dating to the  |Mycenaean|Mycenean_Greece|  period in which the Iliad is set, and, anachronistically, a later style, with throwing spears, from Homers own  |Archaic|Archaic_Greece|  period.      In the 7th century BCE, the Greeks evolved a new close-order infantry formation, the  |phalanx|Phalanx_Formation| .  The key to this formation was the  |hoplite|Hoplite| , who was equipped with a large, circular, bronze-faced shield  and a  spear with an iron head and bronze butt-spike . Hanson , p. 59 The hoplite phalanx dominated warfare among the Greek City States from the 7th into the 4th century BCE.     The 4th century saw major changes. One was the greater use of  |peltasts|Peltast| , light infantry armed with spear and javelins. Hanson , pp.147–8 The other was the development of the  |sarissa|Sarissa| , a two-handed pike  in length, by the  |Macedon|Macedon| ians under  |Phillip_of_Macedon|Phillip_Of_Macedon|  and  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| . Hanson , pp149-150 The pike phalanx, supported by peltasts and cavalry, became the dominant mode of warfare among the Greeks from the late 4th century onward Hunt, Peter. The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare: Volume 1, Greece, The Hellenistic World and the Rise of Rome. Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 108 until Greek military systems were supplanted by the Roman legions.        In the  |pre-Marian|Gaius_Marius|  Roman armies, the first two lines of battle, the  hastati  and  principes , often fought with a sword called a  gladius  and  pila , heavy javelins that were specifically designed to be thrown at an enemy to pierce and foul a targets shield. Originally the  principes  were armed with a short spear called a  hasta , but these gradually fell out of use, eventually being replaced by the gladius. The third line, the  triarii , continued to use the hasta.     From the late 2nd century BCE, all  |legionaries|Legionary|  were equipped with the pilum. The pilum continued to be the standard legionary spear until the end of the 2nd century CE.  Auxilia , however, were equipped with a simple hasta and, perhaps, throwing spears. During the 3rd century CE, although the pilum continued to be used, legionaries usually were equipped with other forms of throwing and thrusting spear, similar to auxilia of the previous century. By the 4th century, the pilum had effectively disappeared from common use.      In the late period of the Roman Empire, the spear became more often used because of its anti-cavalry capacities as the barbarian invasions were often conducted by people with a developed culture of cavalry in warfare.            Muslim warriors used a spear that was called an  az-zaġāyah .  |Berbers|Berbers|  pronounced it zaġāya, but the English term, derived from the  |Old_French|Old_French|  via  |Berber|Berber_Languages| , is assegai . It is a pole weapon used for throwing or hurling, usually a light spear or javelin made of hard wood and pointed with a forged iron tip.The az-zaġāyah played an important role during the  |Islamic_conquest|Islamic_Conquest|  as well as during later periods, well into the 20th century. A longer pole az-zaġāyah was being used as a hunting weapon from horseback. The az-zaġāyah was widely used. It existed in various forms in areas stretching from  |Southern_Africa|Southern_Africa|  to the  |Indian_subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent| , although these places already had their own variants of the spear. This javelin was the weapon of choice during the  Fulani jihad  as well as during the  |Mahdist_War|Mahdist_War|  in Sudan. It is still being used by Sikh  Nihang  in the  |Punjab|Punjab_Region|  as well as certain wandering Sufi ascetics .       After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the spear and shield continued to be used by nearly all Western European cultures. Since a medieval spear required only a small amount of  |steel|Steel|  along the sharpened edges , it was an economical weapon. Quick to manufacture, and needing less  |smithing|Blacksmith|  skill than a sword, it remained the main weapon of the common soldier. The  |Vikings|Vikings| , for instance, although often portrayed with  |axe|Viking_Axe|  or  |sword|Sword|  in hand, were armed mostly with spears,  as were their  |Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxons| ,  |Irish|Irish_People| , or continental contemporaries.        Broadly speaking, spears were either designed to be used in melee, or to be thrown. Within this simple classification, there was a remarkable range of types. For example, M.J. Swanton identified thirty different spearhead categories and sub-categories in Early Saxon England.  Most medieval spearheads were generally leaf-shaped. Notable types of Early medieval spears include the  angon , a throwing spear with a long head similar to the Roman  pilum , used by the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, and the  |winged_spear|Pole_Weaponwinged_Spear| , which had two prominent wings at the base of the spearhead, either to prevent the spear penetrating too far into an enemy or to aid in spear fencing.  Originally a Frankish weapon, the winged spear also was popular with the Vikings. It would become the ancestor of later medieval polearms, such as the  partisan  and  spetum .     The thrusting spear also has the advantage of reach, being considerably longer than other weapon types. Exact spear lengths are hard to deduce as few spear shafts survive archaeologically but  would seem to have been the norm. Some nations were noted for their long spears, including the Scots and the Flemish. Spears usually were used in tightly ordered formations, such as the  |shieldwall|Shieldwall|  or the  |schiltron|Schiltron| . To resist cavalry, spear shafts could be planted against the ground. e.g. at the  |Battle_of_Steppes|Battle_Of_Steppes|  1213  William Wallace drew up his schiltrons in a circle at the  |Battle_of_Falkirk|Battle_Of_Falkirk|  in 1298 to deter charging cavalry,  it was a widespread tactic sometimes known as the crown formation.      Throwing spears became rarer as the Middle Ages drew on, but survived in the hands of specialists such as the Catalan  |Almogavars|Almogavars| .  They were commonly used in Ireland until the end of the 16th century.      Spears began to lose fashion among the infantry during the 14th century, being replaced by  |pole_weapons|Pole_Weapons|  that combined the thrusting properties of the spear with the cutting properties of the axe, such as the  |halberd|Halberd| . Where spears were retained they grew in length, eventually evolving into  |pikes|Pike| , which would be a dominant infantry weapon in the 16th and 17th centuries.       |stirrups|Stirrup|  and a high-cantled saddle, the spear became a decidedly more powerful weapon. A mounted knight would secure the  |lance|Lance|  by holding it with one hand and tucking it under the armpit   This allowed all the momentum of the horse and knight to be focused on the weapons tip, whilst still retaining accuracy and control. This use of the spear spurred the development of the  |lance|Lance|  as a distinct weapon that was perfected in the medieval sport of  |jousting|Jousting| . Sébastien Nadot, Rompez les lances ! Chevaliers et tournois au Moyen Age, Paris, ed. Autrement, 2010.      In the 14th century, tactical developments meant that knights and men-at-arms often fought on foot. This led to the practice of shortening the lance to about .20042004more akin to a pikespear |dagger-axe|Dagger-Axe| |o|O| |a|A| polearm戟 Ji can be loosely defined as a halberd |Eastern_Han|Eastern_Han| 矟spear枪a kind of woodA kind of woodeleven feet and nine inches or 3.58 mXiao Hua Qiang 小花枪 |ti|Ti| footmensimilar with European  |pike|Pike| |e|E| |sibat|Sibat| after the  |Bankaw_Revolt|Bankaw_Revolt| . |tive_Americ|Tive_Americ| |ap|Ap| 2001 |ap|Ap| 19801980 |storic|Storic| 2001  |see_above|Infantry_Spears| 2003  2003 |cati|Cati| |Qiang|Qiang|  槍 |ranorm|Ranorm| Jun. – Oct., 1927from Latin sub under, juguma yokenamed  |Gungnir|Gungnir| operaas a symbol of female fertilityin a somewhat archaic manner     Yide  |tholo|Tholo|   1983Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1992.
