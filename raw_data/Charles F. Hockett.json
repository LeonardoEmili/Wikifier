        " linguistics.           After carefully examining the generative schools proposed innovations in Linguistics, Hockett decided that this approach was of little value. His book The State of the Art outlined his criticisms of the generative approach. In his paraphrase a key principle of the Chomskyan paradigm is that there are an infinite number of grammatical sentences in any particular language.   The grammar of a language is a finite system that characterizes an infinite set of sentences. More specifically, the grammar of a language is a well-defined system by definition not more powerful than a universal Turing machine . The State of the Art, p. 40     The crux of Hocketts rebuttal is that the set of grammatical sentences in a language is not infinite, but rather ill-defined. p. 52 et passim Hockett proposes that no physical system is well-defined . p. 52     Later in Where the tongue slips, there slip I he writes as follows.     It is currently fashionable to assume that, underlying the actual more or less bumbling speech behavior of any human being, there is a subtle and complicated but determinate linguistic competence : a sentence-generating device whose design can only be roughly guessed at by any techniques so far available to us. This point of view makes linguistics very hard and very erudite, so that anyone who actually does discover facts about underlying competence is entitled to considerable kudos.     Within this popular frame of reference, a theory of performance -- of the generation of speech -- must take more or less the following form. If a sentence is to be uttered aloud, or even thought silently to oneself, it must first be built by the internal competence of the speaker, the functioning of which is by definition such that the sentence will be legal in every respect. But that is not enough; the sentence as thus constructed must then be performed, either overtly so that others may hear it, or covertly so that it is perceived only by the speaker himself. It is in this second step that blunders may appear. That which is generated by the speakers internal competence is what the speaker intends to say, and is the only real concern of linguistics: blunders in actually performed speech are instructions from elsewhere. Just if there are no such intrusions is what is performed an instance of smooth speech .     I believe this view is unmitigated nonsense, unsupported by any empirical evidence of any sort. In its place, I propose the following.     All speech, smooth as well as blunderful, can be and must be accounted for essentially in terms of the three mechanisms we have listed: analogy, blending, and editing. An individuals language, at a given moment, is a set of habits--that is, of analogies, where different analogies are in conflict, one may appear as a constraint on the working of another. Speech actualizes habits--and changes the habits as it does so. Speech reflects awareness of norms; but norms are themselves entirely a matter of analogy , not some different kind of thing. The View From Language, pp. 254-255.     Despite his criticisms, Hockett always expressed gratitude to the generative school for seeing real problems in the preexisting approaches.     There are many situations in which bracketing does not serve to disambiguate. As already noted, words that belong together cannot always be spoken together, and when they are not, bracketing is difficult or impossible. In the 1950s this drove some grammarians to drink and other to transformations, but both are only anodynes, not answers Hockett, Refurbishing our Foundations.

His “extra” Feature is:     :17. Grammaticality Grammar  Syntax  by psychologist Timothy Gentner of the University of California at San Diego. Gentners study found that starling songbirds use recursive grammar to identify “odd” statements within a given “song.” However, the study does not necessarily debunk Chomskys observation because it has not yet been proven that songbirds have the semantic ability to generalize from patterns.      that symbolic thought is necessary for grammar-based speech, and thus Homo Erectus and all preceding “humans” would have been unable to comprehend modern speech. Rather, their utterances would have been halting and even quite confusing to us,   today.
