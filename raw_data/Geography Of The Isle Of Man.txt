The Isle of Man enjoys a  |temperate|Temperate|  climate, with cool summers and mild winters. Average rainfall is high compared to the majority of the  |British_Isles|British_Isles| , due to its location to the western side of Great Britain and sufficient distance from  |Ireland|Ireland|  for moisture to be accumulated by the prevailing south-westerly winds. Average rainfall is highest at  |Snaefell|Snaefell| , where it is around  a year. At lower levels it can fall to around  a year.     Temperatures remain fairly cool, with the recorded maximum being  at  |Ronaldsway|Ronaldsway| .               The islands terrain is varied. There are two mountainous areas divided by a central valley which runs between  |Douglas|Douglas_Isle_Of_Man|  and  |Peel|Peel_Isle_Of_Man| . The highest point in the Isle of Man,  |Snaefell|Snaefell| , is in the northern area and reaches   |above_sea_level|Above_Mean_Sea_Level| . The northern end of the island is a flat plain, consisting of glacial  |tills|Till|  and marine sediments. To the south the island is more hilly, with distinct valleys. There is no land below sea level.       Arable land: 43.86%   Permanent crops: 0%   Other: 56.14%       There are few severe natural hazards, the most common being high winds, rough seas and dense  |fog|Fog| . In recent years there has been a marked increase in the frequency of high winds, heavy rains, summer droughts and  |flood|Flood| ing both from heavy rain and from high seas.  |Snow|Snow|  fall has decreased significantly over the past century while temperatures are increasing year round with  |rainfall|Rainfall|  decreasing.      |Air_pollution|Air_Pollution| ,  |marine_pollution|Marine_Pollution|  and  |waste_disposal|Waste_Disposal|  are issues in the Isle of Man.

There is a belt of younger  |Silurian|Silurian|  rocks along the west coast between  |Niarbyl|Niarbyl|  and Peel, and a small area of  |Devonian|Devonian|  sandstones around Peel.   A band of  |Carboniferous|Carboniferous|  period rocks underlies part of the northern plain, but is nowhere seen at the surface; however similar age rocks do outcrop in the south between Castletown, Silverdale and Port St Mary.  |Permo_|Permian| |Triassic|Triassic|  age rocks are known to lie beneath the Point of Ayre but, as with the rest of the northern plain, these rocks are concealed by substantial thicknesses of superficial deposits.
