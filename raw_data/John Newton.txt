            John Newton  was an English  |Anglican|Anglican|  clergyman and  |abolitionist|Abolitionist|  who was forced to serve as a sailor in the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|  for a period. He was first a slave of Princess Peye, a black princess of the  |Sherbro_people|Sherbro_People|  and then, years after, He became the captain of  |slave_ships|Slave_Ship| . He became ordained as an evangelical Anglican cleric, served  |Olney_Buckinghamshire|Olney_Buckinghamshire| , for two decades, and also wrote hymns, known for  |Amazing_Grace|Amazing_Grace|  and  |Glorious_Things_of_Thee_Are_Spoken|Glorious_Things_Of_Thee_Are_Spoken|  .     Newton started his career at sea at a young age, and worked on slave ships in the  |slave_trade|Slave_Trade|  for several years. After experiencing a period of  |Christian_conversion|Conversion_To_Christianity|  Newton eventually renounced his trade and became a prominent supporter of  |abolitionism|Abolitionism_In_The_United_Kingdom| , living to see the UKs abolition of the African slave trade in 1807, just before his death.       John Newton was born in  |Wapping|Wapping| , London, in 1725, the son of John Newton Sr., a  |shipmaster|Skipper|  in the  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean|  service, and Elizabeth . Elizabeth was the only daughter of Simon Scatliff, an instrument maker from London . Elizabeth was brought up as a  |Nonconformist|Nonconformist| . She died of  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis|  in July 1732, about two weeks before Johns seventh birthday. Newton spent two years at boarding school before going to live in  |Aveley|Aveley|  in  |Essex|Essex| , the home of his fathers new wife.     At age eleven he first went to sea with his father. Newton sailed six voyages before his father retired in 1742. At that time, Newtons father made plans for him to work at a  |sugarcane|Sugarcane| |_plantation|Sugar_Plantations_In_The_Caribbean|  in  |Jamaica|Jamaica| . Instead, Newton signed on with a merchant ship sailing to the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea| .       In 1743, while going to visit friends, Newton was captured and  |pressed|Impressment|  into the naval service by the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy| . He became a  |midshipman|Midshipman|  aboard  |HMS_Harwich|Hms_Harwich| . At one point Newton tried to desert and was punished in front of the crew of 350. Stripped to the waist and tied to the grating, he received a  |flogging|Flogging|  of eight dozen lashes and was reduced to the rank of a common  |seaman|Seaman| .     Following that disgrace and humiliation, Newton initially contemplated murdering the captain and committing suicide by throwing himself overboard. He recovered, both physically and mentally. Later, while Harwich was en route to  |India|India| , he transferred to Pegasus, a  |slave_ship|Slave_Ship|  bound for  |West_Africa|West_Africa| . The ship carried goods to Africa and traded them for slaves to be shipped to the colonies in the Caribbean and North America.       Newton did not get along with the crew of Pegasus. In 1745 they left him in West Africa with Amos Clowe, a slave dealer. Clowe took Newton to the coast and gave him to his wife, Princess Peye of the  |Sherbro_people|Sherbro_People| . She abused and mistreated Newton just as much as she did her other slaves. Newton later recounted this period as the time he was once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in West Africa. Memorial epitaph, St Mary Woolnoth Church, Lombard Street, London.     Early in 1748 he was rescued by a sea captain who had been asked by Newtons father to search for him, and returned to England on the merchant ship Greyhound, which was carrying  |beeswax|Beeswax|  and dyers wood, now referred to as  |camwood|Camwood| .       During his 1748 voyage to England after his rescue, Newton had a spiritual conversion. The ship encountered a severe storm off the coast of  |Donegal|Donegal| ,  |Ireland|Ireland|  and almost sank.     He began to read the  |Bible|Bible|  and other religious literature. By the time he reached Britain, he had accepted the doctrines of  |evangelical_Christianity|Evangelical_Christianity| . The date was 10 March 1748, an anniversary he marked for the rest of his life. From that point on, he avoided profanity, gambling and drinking. Although he continued to work in the slave trade, he had gained sympathy for the slaves during his time in Africa. He later said that his true conversion did not happen until some time later: I cannot consider myself to have been a believer in the full sense of the word, until a considerable time afterwards.        Newton returned in 1748 to  |Liverpool|Liverpool| , England, a major port for the  |Triangle_Trade|Triangle_Trade| . Partly due to the influence of his fathers friend Joseph Manesty, he obtained a position as  |first_mate|First_Mate|  aboard the slave ship Brownlow, bound for the  |West_Indies|West_Indies|  via the coast of  |Guinea|Guinea| .     It was when returning to England aboard the ship Greyhound in 1748, awoke to find themselves caught in a violent storm and about to sink. He prayed for Gods mercy, the storm died down. After four more weeks at sea the Greyhound made it to port in Lough Swilly, Ireland. This experience marked the beginning of his conversion to Christianity.      Newton continued to work in the slave trade. After his return to England in 1750, he made three voyages as captain of the slave ships Duke of Argyle and African . After suffering a severe stroke in 1754, he gave up seafaring and slave-trading activities, but continued to invest in Manestys slaving operations.     In 1780 Newton moved to the City of London as rector of  |St_Mary_Woolnoth_Church|St_Mary_Woolnoth| , where he contributed to the work of the  |Committee_for_the_Abolition_of_the_Slave_Trade|Society_For_Effecting_The_Abolition_Of_The_Slave_Trade| , formed in 1787. During this time he wrote Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade. In it he states; So much light has been thrown upon the subject, by many able pens; and so many respectable persons have already engaged to use their utmost influence, for the suppression of a traffic, which contradicts the feelings of humanity; that it is hoped, this stain of our National character will soon be wiped out.        In 1750 Newton married his childhood sweetheart, Mary Catlett, in  |St_Margarets_Church_Rochester|St_Margarets_Church_Rochester| .     Newton adopted his two orphaned nieces, Elizabeth Cunningham and Eliza Catlett, both from the Catlett side of the family.  Newtons niece Alys Newton later married Mehul, a prince from India.        In 1755 Newton was appointed as tide surveyor of the  |Port_of_Liverpool|Port_Of_Liverpool| , again through the influence of Manesty. In his spare time, he studied  |Greek|Greek_Language| ,  |Hebrew|Hebrew| , and  |Syriac|Syriac_Language| , preparing for serious religious study. He became well known as an evangelical lay minister. In 1757, he applied to be  |ordained|Ordination|  as a priest in the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , but it was more than seven years before he was eventually accepted.     During this period, he also applied to the  |Methodists|Methodist| ,  |Independents|Independent|  and  |Presbyterians|Presbyterians| . He mailed applications directly to the  |Bishops_of_Chester|Bishop_Of_Chester|  and  |Lincoln|Bishop_Of_Lincoln|  and the Archbishops of  |Canterbury|Archbishop_Of_Canterbury|  and  |York|Archbishop_Of_York| .     Eventually, in 1764, he was introduced by  |Thomas_Haweis|Thomas_Haweis|  to  |William_Legge_2nd_Earl_of_Dartmouth|William_Legge_2Nd_Earl_Of_Dartmouth| , who was influential in recommending Newton to  |William_Markham|William_Markham| , Bishop of Chester. Haweis suggested Newton for the living of  |Olney|Olney_Buckinghamshire| ,  |Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire| . On 29 April 1764 Newton received deacons orders, and finally was ordained as a priest on 17 June.     As curate of Olney, Newton was partly sponsored by  |John_Thornton|John_Thornton| , a wealthy merchant and evangelical philanthropist. He supplemented Newtons stipend of £60 a year with £200 a year for hospitality and to help the poor . Newton soon became well known for his pastoral care, as much as for his beliefs. His friendship with  |Dissenters|English_Dissenters|  and evangelical clergy led to his being respected by Anglicans and  |Nonconformists|Nonconformism|  alike. He spent sixteen years at Olney. His preaching was so popular that the congregation added a gallery to the church to accommodate the many persons who flocked to hear him.     Some five years later, in 1772,  |Thomas_Scott|Thomas_Scott|  took up the curacy of the neighbouring parishes of  |Stoke_Goldington|Stoke_Goldington|  and  |Weston_Underwood|Weston_Underwood_Milton_Keynes| . Newton was instrumental in converting Scott from a cynical ‘career priest’ to a true believer, a conversion which Scott related in his spiritual autobiography The Force Of Truth . Later Scott became a biblical commentator and co-founder of the  |Church_Missionary_Society|Church_Missionary_Society| .     In 1779 Newton was invited by John Thornton to become Rector of  |St_Mary_Woolnoth|St_Mary_Woolnoth| ,  |Lombard_Street|Lombard_Street_London| , London, where he officiated until his death. The church had been built by  |Nicholas_Hawksmoor|Nicholas_Hawksmoor|  in 1727 in the fashionable  |Baroque_style|Baroque_Style| . Newton was one of only two evangelical Anglican priests in the capital, and he soon found himself gaining in popularity amongst the growing evangelical party. He was a strong supporter of evangelicalism in the Church of England. He remained a friend of Dissenters as well as Anglicans.     Young churchmen and people struggling with faith sought his advice, including such well-known social figures as the writer and philanthropist  |Hannah_More|Hannah_More| , and the young  |William_Wilberforce|William_Wilberforce| , a Member of Parliament who had recently suffered a crisis of conscience and religious conversion while contemplating leaving politics. The younger man consulted with Newton, who encouraged Wilberforce to stay in Parliament and serve God where he was .     In 1792, Newton was presented with the degree of  |Doctor_of_Divinity|Doctor_Of_Divinity|  by the  |College_of_New_Jersey|Princeton_University|  .          In 1788, 34 years after he had retired from the slave trade, Newton broke a long silence on the subject with the publication of a forceful pamphlet Thoughts Upon the Slave Trade, in which he described the horrific conditions of the slave ships during the  |Middle_Passage|Middle_Passage| . He apologised for a confession, which  ... comes too late  ... It will always be a subject of humiliating reflection to me, that I was once an active instrument in a business at which my heart now shudders. He had copies sent to every MP, and the pamphlet sold so well that it swiftly required reprinting.     Newton became an ally of  |William_Wilberforce|William_Wilberforce| , leader of the Parliamentary campaign to abolish the African slave trade. He lived to see the British passage of the  |Slave_Trade_Act_1807|Slave_Trade_Act_1807| , which enacted this event.       Newton came to believe that during the first five of his nine years as a slave trader he had not been a Christian in the full sense of the term. In 1763 he wrote: I was greatly deficient in many respects  ... I cannot consider myself to have been a believer in the full sense of the word, until a considerable time afterwards.           In 1767  |William_Cowper|William_Cowper| , the poet, moved to Olney. He worshipped in Newtons church, and collaborated with the priest on a volume of hymns; it was published as  Olney Hymns  in 1779. This work had a great influence on English hymnology. The volume included Newtons well-known hymns:  |Glorious_Things_of_Thee_Are_Spoken|Glorious_Things_Of_Thee_Are_Spoken| , How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds!, Let Us Love, and Sing, and Wonder, Come, My Soul, Thy Suit Prepare, Approach, My Soul, the Mercy-seat , and Faiths Review and Expectation, which has come to be known by its opening phrase,  |Amazing_Grace|Amazing_Grace|  .        Many of Newtons hymns are preserved in the  Sacred Harp , a hymnal used in the American South during the  |Second_Great_Awakening|Second_Great_Awakening| . Hymns were scored according to the tonal scale for  |shape_note_singing|Shape_Note_Singing| . Easily learnt and incorporating singers into four-part harmony, shape note music was widely used by evangelical preachers to reach new congregants.     In 1776 Newton contributed a preface to an annotated version of  |John_Bunyans|John_Bunyan|   The Pilgrims Progress .     Newton also contributed to the  |Cheap_Repository_Tracts|Cheap_Repository_Tracts| . He wrote an autobiography entitled   An Authentic Narrative of Some Remarkable And Interesting Particulars in the Life of ------ Communicated, in a Series of Letters, to the Reverend T. Haweiss, which he published anonymously. It was later described as written in an easy style, distinguished by great natural shrewdness, and sanctified by the Lord God and prayer .       Newtons wife Mary Catlett died in 1790, after which he published Letters to a Wife , in which he expressed his grief. Plagued by ill health and failing eyesight, Newton died on 21 December 1807 in London. He was buried beside his wife in St. Mary Woolnoth in London. Both were reinterred at the Church of St. Peter and Paul in Olney in 1893.             |St_Mary_Woolnoth|St_Mary_Woolnoth| .
