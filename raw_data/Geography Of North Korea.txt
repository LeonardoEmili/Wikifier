|North_Korea|North_Korea|  is located in  |East_Asia|East_Asia|  on the Northern half of the  |Korean_Peninsula|Korean_Peninsula| .      |North_Korea|North_Korea|  shares a border with three countries;  |China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  along the  |Amnok_River|Amnok_River| , Russia along the  |Tumen_River|Tumen_River| , and  |South_Korea|South_Korea|  along the  |Korean_Demilitarized_Zone|Korean_Demilitarized_Zone|  . The  |Yellow_Sea|Yellow_Sea|  and the  |Korea_Bay|Korea_Bay|  are off the west coast and the  |Sea_of_Japan|Sea_Of_Japan|  is off the east coast.     Most of North Korea is a series of medium-sized to large-sized Mountain Ranges and large hills, separated by deep, narrow valleys. The highest peak, Paektu-san on the volcanic Baekdu Mountain, is located on its northern border with China, and rises 9,002  ft. . Along the west coast there are wide coastal plains, while along the East Sea coastline , narrow plains rise into mountains. Similar to South Korea, dozens of small islands dot the western coastline. North Koreas longest river is the Yulu . Other large rivers include the Tumen, Taedong and Imjin.            The terrain consists mostly of  |hills|Hill|  and  |mountains|Mountain|  separated by deep, narrow  |valleys|Valley| . The coastal  |plains|Plain|  are wide in the west and discontinuous in the east.     Early  |Europe|Europe| an visitors to Korea remarked that the country resembled a sea in a heavy gale because of the many successive  |mountain_ranges|Mountain_Range|  that crisscross the peninsula. Some 80 percent of North Koreas land area is composed of mountains and uplands, with all of the peninsulas mountains with elevations of  or more located in North Korea. The great majority of the population lives in the plains and lowlands.      |Paektu_Mountain|Paektu_Mountain| , the highest point in North Korea at 2,743 m , is a  |volcanic_mountain|Volcano|  near Manchuria with  |basalt|Basalt| |lava|Lava| |plateau|Plateau|  with elevations between  and  above sea level. The  |Hamgyong_Range|Hamgyong_Mountains| , located in the extreme northeastern part of the peninsula, has many high peaks, including Kwanmobong at approximately .     Other major ranges include the  |Rangrim_Mountains|Rangrim_Mountains| , which are located in the north-central part of North Korea and run in a north-south direction, making communication between the eastern and western parts of the country rather difficult; and the  |Kangnam|Kangnam_Mountains|  Range, which runs along the North Korea–China border.  |Geumgangsan|Geumgangsan| , often written Mt Kumgang, or Diamond Mountain,  in the  |Thaebaek|Taebaek_Mountains|  Range, which extends into South Korea, is famous for its scenic beauty.     For the most part, the plains are small. The most extensive are the  |Pyongyang|Pyongyang|  and  |Chaeryŏng|Chaeryong|  plains, each covering about 500  km 2 . Because the mountains on the east coast drop abruptly to the sea, the plains are even smaller there than on the west coast.     The mountain ranges in the northern and eastern parts of North Korea form the watershed for most of its rivers, which run in a westerly direction and empty into the Yellow Sea and Korea Bay. The longest is the Amnok River, which is navigable for 678  km of its . The Tuman River, one of the few major rivers to flow into the Sea of Japan, is the second longest at  but is navigable for only  because of the mountainous topography.     The third longest river, the  |Taedong_River|Taedong_River| , flows through Pyongyang and is navigable for 245 of its 397  km. Lakes tend to be small because of the lack of glacial activity and the stability of the Earths crust in the region. Unlike neighboring Japan or northern China, North Korea experiences few severe  |earthquakes|Earthquake| . The country has a number of natural spas and hot springs, which number 124 according to one North Korean source.           North Korea has a combination of a  |continental_climate|Continental_Climate|  and an  |oceanic_climate|Oceanic_Climate| , with four distinct seasons.   Most of North Korea is classified as being of a  |humid_continental_climate|Humid_Continental_Climate|  within the  |Köppen_climate_classification|Köppen_Climate_Classification|  scheme, with warm summers and cold, dry winters. In summer, there is a short rainy season called changma.      Long winters bring bitter cold and clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from  |Siberia|Siberia| . The daily average high and low temperatures for Pyongyang in January are . On average, it snows thirty-seven days during the winter. Winter can be particularly harsh in the northern, mountainous regions.     Summer tends to be short, hot, humid, and rainy because of the southern and southeastern  |monsoon|Monsoon|  winds that bring moist air from the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean| . Spring and autumn are transitional seasons marked by mild temperatures and variable winds and bring the most pleasant weather. The daily average high and low temperatures for  |Pyongyang|Pyongyang|  in August are .     On average, approximately 60% of all precipitation occurs from June to September. Natural hazards include late spring droughts which are  |often_followed_by_severe_flooding|North_Korea_Flooding| . Typhoons affect the peninsula on an average of at least once every summer or early autumn. The drought that started in June 2015, according to the  |Korean_Central_News_Agency|Korean_Central_News_Agency| , has been the worst seen in 100 years.

In recent years, the environment has been reported to be in a state of crisis , catastrophe , or collapse .       Cultivation, logging, and natural disasters have all put pressure on North Koreas forests. During the  |economic_crisis_of_the_1990s|North_Korean_Famine| , deforestation accelerated, as people turned to the woodlands to provide firewood and food. This in turn has led to soil erosion, soil depletion, and increased risk of flooding. In response, the government has promoted a tree planting program.   Based on satellite imagery, it has been estimated that 40 percent of forest cover has been lost since 1985.             North Korea has an area of 120,538  km², of which 120,408  km² is land and 130  km² is water. It has  of land boundaries; of these,  are with China,  are with South Korea, and  are with Russia.     The Korean Peninsula extends about  southward from the northeast Asian continental landmass. The  coastline of  |Korea|Korea|  is highly irregular, and North Korea accounts for  of this, roughly one-third. Some 3579  |islands|Island|  lie adjacent to the Korean Peninsula, mostly along the south and west coasts.

Waters of the Yellow Sea are demarcated between North Korea and South Korea by the disputed  |Northern_Limit_Line|Northern_Limit_Line|  drawn by the  |United_Nations_Command|United_Nations_Command|  in early 1950s and not officially recognized by North Korea.
