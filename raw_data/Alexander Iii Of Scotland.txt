Alexander III  was  |King_of_Scots|King_Of_Scots|  from 1249 until his death. He concluded the  |Treaty_of_Perth|Treaty_Of_Perth| , by which Scotland acquired sovereignty over the Western Isles and the Isle of Man. His heir,  |Margaret,_Maid_of_Norway|Margaret,_Maid_Of_Norway| , died before she could be crowned.       Alexander was born at  |Roxburgh|Roxburgh| , the only son of  |Alexander_II|Alexander_Ii_Of_Scotland|  by his second wife  |Marie_de_Coucy|Marie_De_Coucy| . Alexander III was also the grandson of  |William_the_Lion|William_The_Lion| . Alexanders father died on 8 July 1249 and he became king at the age of seven, inaugurated at  |Scone|Scone,_Perth_And_Kinross|  on 13 July 1249.     The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by  |Walter_Comyn|Walter_Comyn| ,  |Earl_of_Menteith|Earl_Of_Menteith| , the other by  |Alan_Durward|Alan_Durward| ,  |Justiciar_of_Scotia|Justiciar_Of_Scotia| . The former dominated the early years of Alexanders reign. At the marriage of Alexander to  |Margaret_of_England|Margaret_Of_England|  in 1251,  |Henry_III_of_England|Henry_Iii_Of_England|  seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at  |Kelso|Kelso,_Scottish_Borders|  led to Menteith and his party losing to Durwards party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.      On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the  |Western_Isles|Western_Isles|  which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short. He laid a formal claim before the  |Norwegian|Norway|  king  |Haakon|Haakon_Iv_Of_Norway| . Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the  |Isle_of_Arran|Isle_Of_Arran| , and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific  |storm|Extreme_Weather|  which greatly damaged his ships. The  |Battle_of_Largs|Battle_Of_Largs|  proved indecisive, but even so, Haakons position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexanders feet, and in 1266 Haakons successor concluded the  |Treaty_of_Perth|Treaty_Of_Perth|  by which he ceded the  |Isle_of_Man|Isle_Of_Man|  and the  |Western_Isles|Western_Isles|  to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained  |Orkney|Orkney|  and  |Shetland|Shetland|  until 1469 when they became a dowry for  |James_IIIs|James_Iii_Of_Scotland|  bride,  |Margaret_of_Denmark|Margaret_Of_Denmark,_Queen_Of_Scotland| .         Alexander had married  |Margaret|Margaret_Of_England|  , daughter of King  |Henry_III_of_England|Henry_Iii_Of_England|  and  |Eleanor_of_Provence|Eleanor_Of_Provence| , on 25 December 1251, when he was ten years old and she was eleven.  She died in 1275, after they had had three children.   :    |Margaret|Margaret_Of_Scotland|  , who married King  |Eric_II_of_Norway|Eric_Ii_Of_Norway| |Alexander,_Prince_of_Scotland|Alexander,_Prince_Of_Scotland|  ; buried in  |Dunfermline_Abbey|Dunfermline_Abbey|    David ; buried in  |Dunfermline_Abbey|Dunfermline_Abbey|      According to the  |Lanercost_Chronicle|Lanercost_Chronicle| , Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise.      Towards the end of Alexanders reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance. In 1284 he induced the  |Estates|Parliament_Of_Scotland|  to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter  |Margaret,_the_Maid_of_Norway|Margaret_Of_Scotland| . The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to  |Yolande_de_Dreux|Yolande_De_Dreux|   on 1 November 1285.     Alexander died in a fall from his horse while riding in the dark to visit the queen at  |Kinghorn|Kinghorn|  in  |Fife|Fife|  on 18 March 1286 because it was her birthday the next day.   He had spent the evening at Edinburgh Castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors. He was advised by them not to make the journey to Fife because of weather conditions, but he travelled anyway. Alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing. The 44-year-old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck. Some texts have said that he fell off a cliff.  Although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found, there is a very steep rocky embankment, which would have been fatal in the dark.  After Alexanders death, his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with England. He was buried in  |Dunfermline_Abbey|Dunfermline_Abbey| .     As Alexander left no surviving children, the heir to the throne was his unborn child by Queen Yolande. When Yolandes pregnancy ended, probably with a miscarriage, Alexanders seven-year-old granddaughter  |Margaret,_Maid_of_Norway|Margaret,_Maid_Of_Norway| , became the heir. Margaret died, still uncrowned, on her way to Scotland in 1290. The inauguration of  |John_Balliol|John_Balliol|  as king on 30 November 1292 ended the six years of the  |Guardians_of_Scotland|Guardians_Of_Scotland|  governing the land.     The death of Alexander and the subsequent period of instability in Scotland was lamented in an early  |Scots|Scots_Language|  poem recorded by  |Andrew_of_Wyntoun|Andrew_Of_Wyntoun|  in his  |Orygynale_Cronykil_of_Scotland|Orygynale_Cronykil_Of_Scotland| .          In 1886, a monument to Alexander III was erected at the approximate location of his death in  |Kinghorn|Kinghorn| .             Alexander III has been depicted in historical novels. They include: Nield , p. 37     The Thirsty Sword by Robert Leighton. The novel depicts the Norse invasion of Scotland  and the  |Battle_of_Largs|Battle_Of_Largs| .

But there are suspicions of murder. The novel concludes that Alexander was indeed murdered by a fanatical servant of  |Edward_I_of_England|Edward_I_Of_England| . The killer acting according to Edwards secret desire to overwhelm and control Scotland . Doherty suggests that the personal relations of the two kings were strained by constant arguments, though this is not confirmed by historical sources. Browne, Kreiser , p. 78, 80-81   Quest For A Maid by  |Frances_Mary_Hendry|Frances_Mary_Hendry| .

This novel is the first of a series of novels primarily about the life and times of Robert the Bruce. However, it covers Alexander III and the circumstances surrounding his death in some detail.     |Raphael_Holinshed|Raphael_Holinshed| , in his oft-fanciful history of England in his  |Chronicles|Holinsheds_Chronicles| , stated that at Alexander IIIs wedding, a horrible monster, mostly skeleton but with raw flesh, appeared at the end of the procession and caused the wedding to be hurriedly concluded. This was, in tradition, an omen of death.   Crusader by  |Nigel_Tranter|Nigel_Tranter| . This novel follows the minority of Alexander III and his relationship with David de Lindsay. Tranter, who has written scores of historical novels spanning the range of Scotlands history, also wrote Envoy Extraordinary and True Thomas , both of which take place during the reign of Alexander III, and in which Alexander is a featured character.                |Anderson,_Alan_Orr|Alan_Orr_Anderson|  , Early Sources of Scottish History: AD 500–1286, 2 Vols, , republished,  |Marjorie_Anderson|Marjorie_Ogilvie_Anderson|    idem , Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers: AD 500–1286, , republished,  |Marjorie_Anderson|Marjorie_Ogilvie_Anderson|    .       .
