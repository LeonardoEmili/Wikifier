               Count Gyula Andrássy de Csíkszentkirály et Krasznahorka was a Hungarian statesman, who served as  |Prime_Minister_of_Hungary|Prime_Minister_Of_Hungary|  and subsequently as  |Foreign_Minister|List_Of_Foreign_Ministers_Of_Austria-Hungary|  of  |Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary|  . Andrássy was a conservative; his foreign policies looked to expanding the Empire into Southeast Europe, preferably with British and German support, and without alienating Turkey. He saw Russia as the main adversary, because of its own expansionist policies toward Slavic and Orthodox areas. He distrusted Slavic nationalist movements as a threat to his multi-ethnic empire.       The son of Count  |Károly_Andrássy|Károly_Andrássy|  and  |Etelka_Szapáry|Etelka_Szapáry| , he was born in  |Oláhpatak|Vlachovo|  ,  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary| . The son of a  |liberal|Liberalism|  father who belonged to the political opposition, at a time when opposing the government was very dangerous, Andrássy at a very early age threw himself into the political struggles of the day, adopting at the outset the patriotic side.        |Count_István_Széchenyi|István_Széchenyi|  was the first adequately to appreciate his capacity. In 1845 Andrássy was appointed as president of the society for the regulation of the waters of the  |Upper_Tisza|Tisza|  River.     In 1846, he attracted attention by publishing highly critical articles of the government in  |Lajos_Kossuths|Lajos_Kossuth|  paper, the Pesti Hírlap. He was elected as one of the Radical candidates to the  |Diet|Diet_Of_Hungary|  of 1848.     When the Croats under  |Josip_Jelačić|Josip_Jelačić|  attempted to have  |Međimurje|Međimurje| , which was then part of Hungary, returned to Croatia, Andrássy entered military service. He was commander of the  |gentry|Gentry|  of his county, and served with distinction at the battles of  |Pákozd|Battle_Of_Pákozd|  and  |Schwechat|Battle_Of_Schwechat| , as  |Artúr_Görgeis|Artúr_Görgei|  adjutant .     Toward the end of the war, Andrássy was sent to  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  by the revolutionary government. He was seeking to obtain the neutrality of the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , if not their support, during the struggle with Croatia.     After the catastrophe of  |Világos|Surrender_At_Világos| , where the Hungarians were defeated, Andrássy emigrated to London and then to Paris. On 21 September 1851, he was condemned in absentia to death and was  |hanged|Hanged|  in  |effigy|Effigy|  by the Austrian government for his share in the Hungarian revolt.     In exile for ten years, he studied politics in what was then the centre of European diplomacy. He discerned the weakness of the second French empire beneath its imposing exterior.     Andrássy returned to Hungary in 1858, but his position was still difficult. He had never petitioned for an  |amnesty|Amnesty| , and had steadily rejected all the overtures both of the Austrian government and of the Magyar Conservatives He enthusiastically supported  |Ferenc_Deáks|Ferenc_Deák|  party.     On 21 December 1865, he was chosen vice-president of the Diet. In March 1866, he was elected as president of the sub-committee appointed by the parliamentary commission to draw up the  |Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_of_1867|Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_Of_1867|  between Austria and Hungary. He originated the idea of the Delegations of powers.   It was said at that time that he was the only member of the commission who could persuade the court of the justice of the national claims.     After the  |Battle_of_Königgrätz|Battle_Of_Königgrätz| , he was formally consulted by  |Emperor_Franz_Joseph|Emperor_Franz_Joseph|  for the first time. He recommended the re-establishment of the constitution and the appointment of a responsible foreign and defence ministry.     On 17 February 1867 the king appointed him as the first prime minister of the Hungarian half of the newly formed Dual Monarchy of  |Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary| . The obvious first choice had been  |Ferenc_Deák|Ferenc_Deák| , one of the architects of the  |Compromise|Austro-Hungarian_Compromise_Of_1867| , but he stepped down in favour of Andrássy. Deák described him as the providential statesman given to Hungary by the grace of God.     As premier, Andrássy by his firmness, amiability and dexterity as a debater, soon won for himself a commanding position. Yet his position continued to be difficult, inasmuch as the authority of Deák dwarfed that of all the party leaders, however eminent.     Andrássy chose for himself the departments of war and foreign affairs. It was he who reorganized the  |Honvéd|Royal_Hungarian_Landwehr|  system , and he used often to say that the regulation of the military border districts was the most difficult labour of his life.     On the outbreak of the  |Franco-Prussian_War|Franco-Prussian_War|  of 1870, Andrássy resolutely defended the neutrality of the Austrian monarchy, and in his speech on 28 July 1870 warmly protested against the assumption that it was in the interests of Austria to seek to recover the position she had held in Germany before 1863. On the fall of  |Beust|Count_Friedrich_Ferdinand_Von_Beust|  , Andrássy stepped into his place. His tenure of the chancellorship was epoch-making.     Hitherto the empire of the Habsburgs had never been able to dissociate itself from its  |Holy_Roman|Holy_Roman_Empire|  traditions. But its loss of influence in  |Italy|Italy|  and Germany, and the consequent formation of the  |Dual_State|Dual_State| , had at length indicated the proper, and, indeed, the only field for its diplomacy in the future – the  |Near_East|Near_East| , where the process of the crystallization of the  |Balkan|Balkan|  peoples into nationalities was still incomplete. The question was whether these nationalities were to be allowed to become independent or were only to exchange the tyranny of the  |sultan|Sultan|  for the tyranny of the  |tsar|Tsar|  or the Habsburg emperor.     Hitherto Austria had been content either to keep out the  |Russians|Russians|  or share the booty with them. She was now, moreover, in consequence of her misfortunes deprived of most of her influence in the councils of Europe.      It was Andrassy who recovered for her proper place in the European concert. First he approached the German emperor; then more friendly relations were established with the courts of  |Italy|Italy|  and  |Russia|Russia|  by means of conferences at Berlin,  |Vienna|Vienna| ,  |St_Petersburg|St_Petersburg|  and  |Venice|Venice| .       The recovered influence of Austria was evident in the negotiations which followed the outbreak of serious disturbances in  |Bosnia|Bosnia_Vilayet|  in 1875.     The three courts of Vienna, Berlin and St Petersburg reached an understanding as to their attitude in the Eastern question, and their views were embodied in the dispatch, known as the Andrássy Note , sent on 30 December 1875 by Andrássy to Count Beust, the Austrian ambassador to the Court of St James.     In it he pointed out that the efforts of the powers to localize the revolt seemed in danger of failure, that the rebels were still holding their own, and that the  |Ottoman|Ottoman_Empire|  promises of reform, embodied in various  |firmans|Firman| , were no more than vague statements of principle which had never had, and were probably not intended to have, any local application. In order to avert the risk of a general conflagration, therefore, he urged that the time had come for concerted action of the powers for the purpose of pressing the Porte to fulfil its promises.     A sketch of the more essential reforms followed: the recognition rather than the toleration of the  |Christian_religion|Christianity| ; the abolition of the system of farming the taxes; and, in  |Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina| , where the religious was complicated by an agrarian question, the conversion of the Christian peasants into free proprietors, to rescue them from their double subjection to the Muslim Ottoman landowners.     In  |Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|Bosnia_And_Herzegovina|  elected provincial councils were to be established, life-term judges appointed and individual liberties guaranteed.     Finally, a mixed commission of Muslims and Christians was to be empowered to watch over the carrying out of these reforms.     The fact that the sultan would be responsible to Europe for the realization of his promises would serve to allay the natural suspicions of the insurgents. To this plan both  |Britain|Great_Britain|  and France gave a general assent, and the Andrássy Note was adopted as the basis of negotiations.     When war became inevitable between  |Russia|Russia|  and the Porte, Andrássy arranged with the Russian court that, in case  |Russia|Russia|  prevailed, the status quo should not be changed to the detriment of the Austrian monarchy. When, however, the  |Treaty_of_San_Stefano|Treaty_Of_San_Stefano|  threatened a Russian hegemony in the Near East, Andrássy concurred with the German and British courts that the final adjustment of matters must be submitted to a European congress.      At the  |Congress_of_Berlin|Congress_Of_Berlin|  in 1878 he was the principal Austrian plenipotentiary, and directed his efforts to diminish the gains of  |Russia|Russia|  and aggrandize the Dual Monarchy. Before the Congress opened on 13 June, negotiations between Andrássy and the British Foreign Secretary  |Marquess_of_Salisbury|Robert_Cecil,_3Rd_Marquess_Of_Salisbury|  had already ended on 6 June by Britain agreeing to all the Austrian proposals relative to Bosnia-Herzegovina about to come before the congress while Austria would support British demands .     In addition to the  |occupation_and_administration_of_Bosnia-Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian_Campaign_In_Bosnia_And_Herzegovina_In_1878| , Andrássy also obtained the right to station garrisons in the  |Sanjak_of_Novi_Pazar|Sanjak_Of_Novi_Pazar| , which remained under Ottoman administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika that would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence . High military authorities desired immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective .     This occupation was most unpopular in Hungary, both for financial reasons and because of the strong philo-Turk sentiments of the Magyars.       On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, behind which stood the  |Archduke_Albert|Archduke_Albrecht,_Duke_Of_Teschen| , were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution by his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion was lost by 179 to 95. By the Opposition rank and file the gravest accusations were raised against Andrassy.       On 10 October 1878 the French diplomat  |Melchior_de_Vogüé|Melchior_De_Vogüé|  described the situation as follows:       Particularly in Hungary the dissatisfaction caused by this adventure has reached the gravest proportions, prompted by that strong conservative instinct which animates the Magyar race and is the secret of its destinies. This vigorous and exclusive instinct explains the historical phenomenon of an isolated group, small in numbers yet dominating a country inhabited by a majority of peoples of different races and conflicting aspirations, and playing a role in European affairs out of all proportions to its numerical importance or intellectual culture. This instinct is to-day awakened and gives warning that it feels the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be a menace which, by introducing fresh Slav elements into the Hungarian political organism and providing a wider field and further recruitment of the Croat opposition, would upset the unstable equilibrium in which the Magyar domination is poised.       Andrássy felt constrained to bow before the storm, and he placed his resignation in the emperors hands . The day before his retirement he signed the offensive-defensive alliance with Germany, which placed the foreign relations of Austria-Hungary once more on a stable footing.          After his retirement, Andrássy continued to take an active part in public affairs both in the Delegations and in the Upper House. In 1885 he warmly supported the project for the reform of the  |House_of_Magnates|House_Of_Magnates| , but on the other hand he jealously defended the inviolability of the Composition of 1867, and on 5 March 1889 in his place in the Upper House spoke against any particularist tampering with the common army. In the last years of his life he regained his popularity, and his death on 18 February 1890, aged 66, was mourned as a national calamity. There is a plaque dedicated to him in the town of  |Volosko|Volosko|  where he died . It is located just above the restaurant Amfora.     He was the first Magyar statesman who, for centuries, had occupied a European position. It has been said that he united in himself the Magyar magnate with the modern gentleman. His motto was: It is hard to promise, but it is easy to perform. If Deák was the architect, Andrássy certainly was the master-builder of the modern Hungarian state.       Andrássy married countess  |Katinka_Kendeffy|Katinka_Kendeffy|  in Paris in 1856. They had two sons,  |Tivadar|Tivadar_Andrássy|  and  |Gyula|Gyula_Andrássy_The_Younger|  , and one daughter,  |Ilona|Ilona_Andrássy|  .     Both sons gained distinction in Hungarian politics. Tivadar was elected vice-president of the Lower House of the Hungarian parliament in 1890. Gyula also had a successful political career.     Count Gyula Andrássys granddaughter, Klára, married the Hungarian nobleman and industrialist Prince Károly Odescalchi.      According to common legend, Count Andrássy had a long lasting romance with  |Elisabeth,_Empress_of_Austria_and_Queen_of_Hungary|Empress_Elisabeth_Of_Austria| , also known as Sisi, the wife of Emperor  |Franz_Josef_I|Franz_Josef_I|  of Austria-Hungary. Some rumored that Sisis fourth child,  |Archduchess_Marie_Valerie_of_Austria|Archduchess_Marie_Valerie_Of_Austria| , had been fathered by Andrassy. There is no evidence for this, and the rumor may have evolved due to the devotion of both Sisi and Count Andrássy towards Hungary, its culture and national customs , and the amount of time they spent together in mutual pursuit of their dreams for Hungary. Additionally, as Marie Valerie grew up, her physical resemblance to her father Franz Josef became very marked.     Count Andrássy had four granddaughters, Klára above, Borbála, married Marquis Pallavicini, Katalin married Count  |Mihály_Károlyi|Mihály_Károlyi|  and Ilona war widow of Prince  |Pál_Esterházy|Pál_Esterházy| , remarried Count  |József_Cziráky|József_Cziráky|.
