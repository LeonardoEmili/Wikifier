Milton Bradley 1961 edition and Milton Bradley 1967 edition More modern versions first introduced in Europe have cylindrical castle-shaped pieces. Some versions have a cardboard privacy screen to assist setup. A few versions have wooden boxes or boards.

Before the start of the game, players arrange their 40 pieces in a 4×10 configuration at either end of the board. The ranks are printed on one side only and placed so that the players cannot identify the opponents pieces. Players may not place pieces in the lakes or the 12 squares in the center of the board.

If one piece strikes the other, both are removed, leaving no mobile pieces on the board. This may be defined as a draw.     The average game has 381 moves. The number of legal positions is 10 115 .

        "; however, unlike those games where a single bad move at any point may result in loss of the game, most moves in Stratego are inconsequential.         All movable pieces, with the exception of the Scout, may move only one step to any adjacent space vertically or horizontally . A piece may not move onto a space occupied by a like-color piece. Bomb and Flag pieces are not moveable. The Scout may move any number of spaces in a straight line . In the older versions of Stratego the Scout could not move and strike in the same turn; in newer versions this was allowed. Even before that, sanctioned play usually amended the original Scout movement to allow moving and striking in the same turn because it facilitates gameplay. No piece can move back and forth between the same two spaces for more than three consecutive turns , nor can a piece endlessly chase a piece it has no hope of capturing .     When the player wants to attack, they move their piece onto a square occupied by an opposing piece. Both players then reveal their pieces rank; the weaker piece is removed from the board. If the engaging pieces are of equal rank, both are removed. A piece may not move onto a square already occupied unless it attacks. Two pieces have special attack powers. One special piece is the Bomb which only Miners can defuse. It immediately eliminates any other piece striking it, without itself being destroyed. Each player also has one Spy, which succeeds only if it attacks the Marshal or the Flag. If the Spy attacks any other piece, or is attacked by any piece , the Spy is defeated. The original rules contained a provision that following a strike, the winning piece immediately occupies the space vacated by the losing piece. This makes sense when the winning piece belongs to the player on move, but no sense when the winning piece belongs to the player not on move. The latter part of the rule has been quietly ignored in most play.       Competitive play does not include recording the game, unlike chess. The game is fast-paced, no standard notation exists, and players keep their initial setups secret, so recording  games is impractical. However, digital interfaces like web-based gaming interfaces, may have a facility for recording, replaying and downloading the game. Those interfaces use an algebraic-style notation that numbers the rows 1 to 10 from bottom to top and the columns A to J from left to right. Alternately, a few interfaces designate the files as A to K, omitting I. Moves are recorded as source square followed by destination square separated by a - or x . Revealed pieces on strikes precede the square designation, and may be by either rank name or rank number for brevity, for example major B2xcaptain B3 . The bottom half of the board is by default considered to be the red side, and the top half the blue side.     No published compilation of recorded exemplary games exists.       Unlike ": null

        " edition of the early 1970s.       Electronic Stratego was introduced by Milton Bradley in 1982. It has features that make many aspects of the game strikingly different from those of classic Stratego. Each type of playing piece in Electronic Stratego has a unique series of bumps on its bottom that are read by the games battery-operated touch-sensitive board . When attacking another piece a player hits their Strike button, presses their piece and then the targeted piece: the game either rewards a successful attack or punishes a failed strike with an appropriate bit of music. In this way the players never know for certain the rank of the piece that wins the attack, only whether the attack wins, fails, or ties . Instead of choosing to move a piece, a player can opt to probe an opposing piece by hitting the Probe button and pressing down on the enemy piece: the game then beeps out a rough approximation of the strength of that piece. There are no Bomb pieces: Bombs are set using pegs placed on a touch-sensitive peg board that is closed from view prior to the start of the game. Hence, it is possible for a player to have their piece occupying a square with a bomb on it. If an opposing piece lands on the seemingly empty square, the game plays the sound of an explosion and that piece is removed from play. As in classic Stratego, only a Miner can remove a Bomb from play. A player who successfully captures the opposing Flag is rewarded with a triumphant bit of music from the  1812 Overture .      In the late 1990s, the Jumbo Company released several European variants, including a three- and four-player version, and a new Cannon piece . It also included some alternate rules such as Barrage and Reserves . The four-player version appeared in America in 1997.     Starting in the 2000s, Hasbro, under its Milton Bradley label, released a series of popular media-themed Stratego editions.     Besides themed variants with substantially different rules, current production includes three slightly different editions: sets with classic piece numbering , sets with European piece numbering , and sets that allow substitution of one or two variant pieces such as Cannons, usually in place of scouts. Sets produced since 1970 or so have uniformly adopted the rule that scouts can move and strike in the same turn.     Stratego, online gaming and AIs ": null

Bell, this game is 20th century, and cannot have been a predecessor of LAttaque or Stratego.
