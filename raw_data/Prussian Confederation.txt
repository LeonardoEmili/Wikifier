     The Prussian Confederation  was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at  |Marienwerder|Kwidzyn|  by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in  |Prussia|Prussia| , to oppose the arbitrariness of the  |Teutonic_Knights|Teutonic_Knights| . It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the  |Lizard_Union|Lizard_Union|  established in 1397 by  |Chełmno_Land|Chełmno_Land|  nobles.     In 1454, the leader of the Confederation,  |Johannes_von_Baysen|Johannes_Von_Baysen|  , formally asked King  |Casimir_IV_Jagiellon|Casimir_Iv_Jagiellon| , to incorporate Prussia into the  |Kingdom_of_Poland|History_Of_Poland_During_The_Jagiellon_Dynasty|  as a  |fief|Fee| . This marked the beginning of the  |Thirteen_Years_War|Thirteen_Years_War|  between the  |Orders_State|State_Of_The_Teutonic_Order|  and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter.       According to the 1411  |First_Peace_of_Thorn|Peace_Of_Thorn|  which followed the Teutonic Knights defeat in the  |Battle_of_Grunwald|Battle_Of_Grunwald| , the Teutonic Order had to pay high reparations to the Kingdom of Poland. The monastic state imposed high taxes on the cities to raise the funds as well as to re-arm for another war against Poland. In the 1420s, Grand Master  |Paul_von_Rusdorf|Paul_Von_Rusdorf|  brought stability to the Order and its relations, but fighting with Poland resumed in 1431, when the Knights invasion into Poland during the  |Lithuanian_Civil_War|Lithuanian_Civil_War|  sparked another  |Polish-Teutonic_conflict|Polish–Teutonic_War| .       After about three decades of growing discontent, the Prussian leaders  organized themselves to oppose the rule of the order more effectively. On 14 March 1440, a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 Prussian cities, under the leadership of the  |Hanseatic|Hanseatic_League|  cities of  |Danzig|Danzig|  ,  |Elbing|Elbing|  , Thorn  and  |Königsberg|Königsberg|  , founded the Prussian Confederation in  |Marienwerder|Marienwerder|  . Several more towns joined on 3 April, although  |Bütow|Bütow|  did not. In Danzig, the new members signed a document which was kept in the archives of Thorn.     After Grand Master  |Paul_von_Rusdorf|Paul_Von_Rusdorf|  died in 1441, his successor,  |Konrad_von_Erlichshausen|Konrad_Von_Erlichshausen| , continued to negotiate a compromise until his own death in 1449. The confederation lobbied for support against the Teutonic Order within the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| .  |Ludwig_von_Erlichshausen|Ludwig_Von_Erlichshausen| , Grand Master from 1450 to 1467, took a more aggressive stance towards the confederation. He filed a lawsuit at the court of Emperor  |Friedrich_III|Frederick_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , whose verdict of 1453 declared the confederation illegal.         In February 1454, the Prussian Confederation rose against the Teutonic Orders rule.  |Gabriel_von_Baysen|Gabriel_Von_Baysen|  and  |Johannes_von_Baysen|Johannes_Von_Baysen| , now leading the confederation with the support of  |Jan_de_Jani|Jan_De_Jani|  and  |Mikołaj_Szarlejski|Mikołaj_Szarlejski| , both of the  |Clan_of_Ostoja|Clan_Of_Ostoja| , requested the protection of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland. They also asked for, and received, a guarantee of their continued city rights and privileges for the nobility.     The resulting  |Thirteen_Years_War|Thirteen_Years_War|  ended in the defeat of the Teutonic Order and the 1466  |Second_Peace_of_Thorn|Second_Peace_Of_Thorn| . The Order lost control of western Prussia. As  |Royal_Prussia|Royal_Prussia| , it became a province of Poland, with some local rights of autonomy.  |Stibor_de_Poniec|Stibor_De_Poniec|  of the  |Clan_of_Ostoja|Clan_Of_Ostoja|  become Lord of tregality of  |Malbork|Malbork| . The Teutonic Knights retained  |eastern_Prussia|Ducal_Prussia| , but only under the overlordship of the Polish king. The Prussian Confederation, with its members now practically divided, ceased to exist as such.         Both the Polish and Teutonic sides agreed to seek the confirmation of the Second Peace of Thorn from Emperor Frederick III and  |Pope_Paul_II|Pope_Paul_Ii| , but they also agreed that this confirmation would not be needed for validation of the treaty. Soon after, however, a dispute about the status of the  |Prince-Bishopric_of_Warmia|Prince-Bishopric_Of_Warmia|  started a smaller conflict called the  |War_of_the_Priests|War_Of_The_Priests| .
