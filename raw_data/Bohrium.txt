         Bohrium is a  |synthetic|Synthetic_Element| |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Bh and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  107. It is named after Danish physicist  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr| . As a synthetic element, it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. All known  |isotopes_of_bohrium|Isotopes_Of_Bohrium|  are extremely  |radioactive|Radioactive| ; the most stable known  |isotope|Isotope|  is 270 Bh with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of approximately 61  seconds, though the unconfirmed 278 Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690  seconds.     In the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , it is a  |d-block|D-Block| |transactinide_element|Transactinide_Element| . It is a member of the  |7th_period|Period_7|  and belongs to the  |group_7_elements|Group_7_Element|  as the fifth member of the 6d series of  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal| . Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier  |homologue|Homology|  to  |rhenium|Rhenium|  in group 7. The  |chemical_properties|Chemical_Properties|  of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.              Two groups claimed  |discovery_of_the_element|Timeline_Of_Chemical_Element_Discoveries| . Evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a Soviet research team led by  |Yuri_Oganessian|Yuri_Oganessian| , in which targets of  |bismuth-209|Bismuth-209|  and  |lead|Lead| -208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of  |chromium|Chromium| -54 and  |manganese|Manganese| -55 respectively.  Two activities, one with a half-life of one to two milliseconds, and the other with an approximately five-second half-life, were seen. Since the ratio of the intensities of these two activities was constant throughout the experiment, it was proposed that the first was from the  |isotope|Isotope|  bohrium-261 and that the second was from its daughter  |dubnium|Dubnium| -257. Later, the dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium-258, which indeed has a five-second half-life ; however, the half-life observed for its parent is much shorter than the half-lives later observed in the definitive discovery of bohrium at  |Darmstadt|Darmstadt|  in 1981. The  |IUPAC|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry| /IUPAP Transfermium Working Group concluded that while dubnium-258 was probably seen in this experiment, the evidence for the production of its parent bohrium-262 was not convincing enough.     In 1981, a German research team led by  |Peter_Armbruster|Peter_Armbruster|  and  |Gottfried_Münzenberg|Gottfried_Münzenberg|  at the  |GSI_Helmholtz_Centre_for_Heavy_Ion_Research|Gsi_Helmholtz_Centre_For_Heavy_Ion_Research|  in Darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium-54 to produce 5 atoms of the isotope bohrium-262:      : +  →  +      This discovery was further substantiated by their detailed measurements of the alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of  |fermium|Fermium|  and  |californium|Californium| . The  |IUPAC|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry| /IUPAP Transfermium Working Group recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.           In September 1992, the German group suggested the name nielsbohrium with symbol Ns to honor the Danish physicist  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr| . The Soviet scientists at the  |Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research|Joint_Institute_For_Nuclear_Research|  in  |Dubna|Dubna| , Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German groups naming proposal for element 107.      There was an  |element_naming_controversy|Element_Naming_Controversy|  as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the  |IUPAC|Iupac|  adopted unnilseptium  as a temporary,  |systematic_element_name|Systematic_Element_Name|  for this element.  In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named bohrium, not nielsbohrium, since there was no precedent for using a scientists complete name in the naming of an element.  This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with  |boron|Boron|  and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective  |oxyanions|Oxyanion| , bohrate and borate. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name bohrium, and thus the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997; the names of the respective oxyanions of boron and bohrium remain unchanged despite their homophony.                   Bohrium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known  |metastable_state|Metastable_State| . All of these but the unconfirmed 278 Bh decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.     The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100  ms for 260 Bh, 261 Bh, 262 Bh, and 262m Bh were observed. 264 Bh, 265 Bh, 266 Bh, and 271 Bh are more stable at around 1  s, and 267 Bh and 272 Bh have half-lives of about 10  s. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with 270 Bh and 274 Bh having measured half-lives of about 61  s and 40  s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope 278 Bh appearing to have an even longer half-life of about 690  s.     The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The five most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, 274, and 278 appear in the decay chains of 282 Nh, 287 Mc, 288 Mc, 294 Ts, and 290 Fl respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from about ten  milliseconds for 262m Bh to about one  minute for 270 Bh and 274 Bh, extending to about twelve minutes for the unconfirmed 278 Bh, one of the longest-lived known superheavy nuclides.          Bohrium is the fifth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of  |group_7|Group_7_Element|  in the periodic table, below  |manganese|Manganese| ,  |technetium|Technetium|  and  |rhenium|Rhenium| . All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohrate, , analogous to the lighter  |permanganate|Permanganate| ,  |pertechnetate|Pertechnetate| , and  |perrhenate|Perrhenate| . Nevertheless, bohrium is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium.     Technetium and rhenium are known to form volatile heptoxides M 2 O 7 , so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh 2 O 7 . The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO 4 .   Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO 3 Cl, so BhO 3 Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO 3 F and MO 2 F 3 for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF 5 and ReF 7 . Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties. Hans Georg Nadler Rhenium and Rhenium Compounds Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000.  Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large  |dipole|Dipole|  moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO 3 Cl & gt; ReO 3 Cl & gt; BhO 3 Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the  |enthalpies|Enthalpy|  of  |adsorption|Adsorption|  of these three compounds. The values are for TcO 3 Cl and ReO 3 Cl are −51  kJ/mol and −61  kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO 3 Cl is −77.8  kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5  kJ/mol.       Bohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a  |hexagonal_close-packed|Hexagonal_Close-Packed|  crystal structure , similar to its lighter  |congener|Congener|  rhenium. It should be a very heavy metal with a  |density|Density|  of around 37.1  g/cm 3 , which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only  |meitnerium|Meitnerium|  and  |hassium|Hassium|  , the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured,  |osmium|Osmium| , has a density of only 22.61  g/cm 3 . This results from bohriums high atomic weight, the  |lanthanide_and_actinide_contractions|Lanthanide_Contraction| , and  |relativistic_effects|Relativistic_Quantum_Chemistry| , although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.     The atomic radius of bohrium is expected to be around 128  pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Bh + ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of 5f 14 6d 4 7s 2 , giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium. Rhenium, on the other hand, follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a 5d electron before a 6s electron, as relativistic effects have become significant by the sixth period, where they cause among other things the yellow color of  |gold|Gold|  and the low melting point of  |mercury|Mercury| . The Bh 2+ ion is expected to have an electron configuration of 5f 14 6d 3 7s 2 ; in contrast, the Re 2+ ion is expected to have a 4f 14 5d 5 configuration, this time analogous to manganese and technetium. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium is expected to be 58  pm . Pentavalent bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of 83  pm.       In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent  |actinides|Actinide| , the  |group_5_elements|Group_5_Element| , and  |polonium|Polonium| .      In 2000, it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves like a typical group 7 element.  A team at the  |Paul_Scherrer_Institute|Paul_Scherrer_Institute|  conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of 267 Bh produced in the reaction between 249 Bk and 22 Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O 2 mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium and rhenium . The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7.  The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, rhenium, and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO 3 Cl & gt; ReO 3 Cl & gt; BhO 3 Cl.     :2 Bh + 3  + 2 HCl → 2  +      The longer-lived heavy isotopes of bohrium, produced as the daughters of heavier elements, offer advantages for future radiochemical experiments. Although the heavy isotope 274 Bh requires a rare and highly radioactive  |berkelium|Berkelium|  target for its production, the isotopes 272 Bh, 271 Bh, and 270 Bh can be readily produced as daughters of more easily produced  |moscovium|Moscovium|  and  |nihonium|Nihonium|  isotopes.
