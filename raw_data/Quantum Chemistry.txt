Quantum chemistry is a branch of  |chemistry|Chemistry|  whose primary focus is the application of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  in  |physical_models|Physical_Model|  and experiments of chemical systems. It is also called molecular quantum mechanics.       Experimental quantum chemists rely heavily on  |spectroscopy|Spectroscopy| , through which information regarding the  |quantization|Quantization|  of energy on a molecular scale can be obtained. Common methods are  |infra_red_spectroscopy|Infra_Red_Spectroscopy| ,  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy| , and  |scanning_probe_microscopy|Scanning_Probe_Microscopy| .     Theoretical quantum chemistry, the workings of which also tend to fall under the category of  |computational_chemistry|Computational_Chemistry| , seeks to calculate the predictions of quantum theory as atoms and molecules can only have discrete energies.     Quantum chemistry studies the  |ground_state|Ground_State|  of individual atoms and molecules, and the  |excited_states|Excited_State| , and  |transition_states|Transition_State|  that occur during  |chemical_reactions|Chemical_Reaction| .     On the calculations, quantum chemical studies use also  |semi_empirical|Semi_Empirical_Quantum_Chemistry_Method|  and other methods based on quantum mechanical principles, and deal with time dependent problems. Many quantum chemical studies assume the nuclei are at rest . Many calculations involve iterative methods that include self-consistent field methods. Major goals of quantum chemistry include increasing the accuracy of the results for small molecular systems, and increasing the size of large molecules that can be processed, which is limited by scaling considerations—the computation time increases as a power of the number of atoms.       Some view the birth of quantum chemistry as starting with the discovery of the  |Schrödinger_equation|Schrödinger_Equation|  and its application to the hydrogen atom in 1926. However, the 1927 article of  |Walter_Heitler|Walter_Heitler|  and  |Fritz_London|Fritz_London| , is often recognized as the first milestone in the history of quantum chemistry. This is the first application of quantum mechanics to the diatomic hydrogen molecule, and thus to the phenomenon of the chemical bond. In the following years much progress was accomplished by  |Robert_S_Mulliken|Robert_S_Mulliken| ,  |Max_Born|Max_Born| ,  |J_Robert_Oppenheimer|J_Robert_Oppenheimer| ,  |Linus_Pauling|Linus_Pauling| ,  |Erich_Hückel|Erich_Hückel| ,  |Douglas_Hartree|Douglas_Hartree| ,  |Vladimir_Fock|Vladimir_Fock| , to cite a few. The history of quantum chemistry also goes through the 1838 discovery of  |cathode_rays|Cathode_Rays|  by  |Michael_Faraday|Michael_Faraday| , the 1859 statement of the  |black_body_radiation|Black_Body_Radiation|  problem by  |Gustav_Kirchhoff|Gustav_Kirchhoff| , the 1877 suggestion by  |Ludwig_Boltzmann|Ludwig_Boltzmann|  that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete, and the 1900 quantum hypothesis by  |Max_Planck|Max_Planck|  that any energy radiating atomic system can theoretically be divided into a number of discrete energy elements ε such that each of these energy elements is proportional to the  |frequency|Frequency|  ν with which they each individually radiate  |energy|Energy|  and a numerical value called  |Plancks_constant|Plancks_Constant| . Then, in 1905, to explain the  |photoelectric_effect|Photoelectric_Effect|  , i.e., that shining light on certain materials can function to eject electrons from the material,  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein|  postulated, based on Plancks quantum hypothesis, that light itself consists of individual quantum particles, which later came to be called  |photons|Photon|  . In the years to follow, this theoretical basis slowly began to be applied to chemical structure, reactivity, and bonding. Probably the greatest contribution to the field was made by  |Linus_Pauling|Linus_Pauling| .            The first step in solving a quantum chemical problem is usually solving the  |Schrödinger_equation|Schrödinger_Equation|   with the  |electronic_molecular_Hamiltonian|Electronic_Molecular_Hamiltonian| . This is called determining the electronic structure of the molecule. It can be said that the electronic structure of a molecule or crystal implies essentially its chemical properties. An exact solution for the Schrödinger equation can only be obtained for the hydrogen atom . Since all other atomic, or molecular systems, involve the motions of three or more particles , their Schrödinger equations cannot be solved exactly and so approximate solutions must be sought.       The foundation of quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry is the wave model, in which the atom is a small, dense, positively charged  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  surrounded by electrons. The wave model is derived from the  |wave_function|Wave_Function| , a set of possible equations derived from the time evolution of the Schrödinger equation which is applied to the wavelike probability distribution of subatomic particles. Unlike the earlier  |Bohr_model|Bohr_Model|  of the atom, however, the wave model describes electrons as  |clouds|Electron_Cloud|  moving in  |orbitals|Molecular_Orbital| , and their positions are represented by  |probability_distributions|Probability_Amplitude|  rather than discrete points. The strength of this model lies in its  |predictive_power|Predictive_Power| . Specifically, it predicts the pattern of chemically similar elements found in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table_Of_Elements| . The wave model is so named because electrons exhibit properties traditionally associated with waves. See  |wave–particle_duality|Wave–Particle_Duality| . In this model, when we solve the Schrödinger Equation for an Hydrogenoid Atom, we obtain a solution that depends on some numbers, called quantum numbers, that describes the orbital, the most probable space where an electron can be. These are n, the principal quantum number, for the energy, l, or secondary quantum number, which correlates to the angular momentum, ml, for the orientation, and ms the spin. This model can explain the new lines that appeared in the spectroscopy of atoms. For multielectron atoms we must introduce some rules as that the electrons fill orbitals in a way to minimize the energy of the atom, in order of increasing energy, the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| ,  |Hunds_rule|Hunds_Rule_Of_Maximum_Multiplicity| , and the  |aufbau_principle|Aufbau_Principle| .            Although the mathematical basis of quantum chemistry had been laid by  |Schrödinger|Erwin_Schrödinger|  in 1926, it is generally accepted that the first true calculation in quantum chemistry was that of the German physicists  |Walter_Heitler|Walter_Heitler|  and  |Fritz_London|Fritz_London|  on the hydrogen molecule in 1927. Heitler and Londons method was extended by the American theoretical physicist  |John_C_Slater|John_C_Slater|  and the American theoretical chemist  |Linus_Pauling|Linus_Pauling|  to become the valence-bond method. In this method, attention is primarily devoted to the pairwise interactions between atoms, and this method therefore correlates closely with classical chemists drawings of  |bonds|Chemical_Bond| . It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of an atom combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed, incorporating the two key concepts of  |orbital_hybridization|Orbital_Hybridization|  and  |resonance|Resonance| .            An alternative approach was developed in 1929 by  |Friedrich_Hund|Friedrich_Hund|  and  |Robert_S_Mulliken|Robert_S_Mulliken| , in which  |electrons|Electron|  are described by mathematical functions delocalized over an entire  |molecule|Molecule| . The Hund–Mulliken approach or molecular orbital method is less intuitive to chemists, but has turned out capable of predicting  |spectroscopic_properties|Spectroscopy|  better than the VB method. This approach is the conceptional basis of the  |Hartree–Fock|Hartree–Fock|  method and further  |post_Hartree–Fock|Post_Hartree–Fock|  methods.            The  |Thomas–Fermi_model|Gas_In_A_Box|  was developed independently by  |Thomas|L_H_Thomas|  and  |Fermi|Enrico_Fermi|  in 1927. This was the first attempt to describe many-electron systems on the basis of  |electronic_density|Electronic_Density|  instead of  |wave_functions|Wave_Function| , although it was not very successful in the treatment of entire molecules. The method did provide the basis for what is now known as density functional theory . Modern day DFT uses the  |Kohn–Sham_method|Kohn–Sham_Equations| , where the density functional is split into four terms; the Kohn–Sham kinetic energy, an external potential, exchange and correlation energies. A large part of the focus on developing DFT is on improving the exchange and correlation terms. Though this method is less developed than post Hartree–Fock methods, its significantly lower computational requirements  allow it to tackle larger  |polyatomic_molecules|Polyatomic_Molecule|  and even  |macromolecules|Macromolecule| . This computational affordability and often comparable accuracy to  |MP2|Møller–Plesset_Perturbation_Theory|  and  |CCSD|Coupled_Cluster|  has made it one of the most popular methods in  |computational_chemistry|Computational_Chemistry| .       A further step can consist of solving the  |Schrödinger_equation|Schrödinger_Equation|  with the total  |molecular_Hamiltonian|Molecular_Hamiltonian|  in order to study the motion of molecules. Direct solution of the Schrödinger equation is called quantum molecular dynamics, within the semiclassical approximation semiclassical molecular dynamics, and within the  |classical_mechanics|Classical_Mechanics|  framework  molecular dynamics . Statistical approaches, using for example  |Monte_Carlo_methods|Monte_Carlo_Method| , are also possible.          In adiabatic dynamics, interatomic interactions are represented by single  |scalar|Scalar| |potentials|Potential|  called  |potential_energy_surfaces|Potential_Energy_Surface| . This is the  |Born–Oppenheimer_approximation|Born–Oppenheimer_Approximation|  introduced by  |Born|Max_Born|  and  |Oppenheimer|Robert_Oppenheimer|  in 1927. Pioneering applications of this in chemistry were performed by  |Rice|Oscar_Knefler_Rice|  and  |Ramsperger|Herman_Carl_Ramsperger|  in 1927 and  |Kassel|L_S_Kassel|  in 1928, and generalized into the  |RRKM|Rrkm|  theory in 1952 by  |Marcus|Rudolph_A_Marcus|  who took the  |transition_state|Transition_State|  theory developed by  |Eyring|Henry_Eyring|  in 1935 into account. These methods enable simple estimates of unimolecular  |reaction_rates|Reaction_Rates|  from a few characteristics of the potential surface.            Non-adiabatic dynamics consists of taking the interaction between several coupled potential energy surface . The coupling terms are called vibronic couplings. The pioneering work in this field was done by  |Stueckelberg|Ernst_Stueckelberg| ,  |Landau|Lev_Davidovich_Landau| , and  |Zener|Clarence_Zener|  in the 1930s, in their work on what is now known as the  |Landau–Zener_transition|Landau–Zener_Transition| . Their formula allows the transition probability between two  |diabatic|Diabatic|  potential curves in the neighborhood of an  |avoided_crossing|Avoided_Crossing|  to be calculated.  |Spin_forbidden_reactions|Spin_Forbidden_Reactions|  are one type of non-adiabatic reactions where at least one change in  |spin_state|Spin_States|  occurs when progressing from  |reactant|Reagent|  to  |product|Product| .
