        ", for example, quantum mechanics textbooks give a classification of the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra   .         Lie algebras can be classified to some extent. In particular, this has an application to the classification of Lie groups.       Analogously to abelian, nilpotent, and solvable groups, defined in terms of the derived subgroups, one can define abelian, nilpotent, and solvable Lie algebras.     A Lie algebra   is abelian if the Lie bracket vanishes, i.e. x,y 0, for all x and y in   . Abelian Lie algebras correspond to commutative  connected Lie groups such as vector spaces   or ": null
