             Mötley Crüe is an American  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metal_Music|  band formed in  |Los_Angeles|Los_Angeles| ,  |California|California| , in 1981 .    The group was founded by bassist  |Nikki_Sixx|Nikki_Sixx| , drummer  |Tommy_Lee|Tommy_Lee| , lead guitarist  |Mick_Mars|Mick_Mars|  and lead singer  |Vince_Neil|Vince_Neil| . Mötley Crüe has sold over 100 million albums worldwide.    They have also achieved seven platinum or multi-platinum certifications, nine Top 10 albums on the  |Billboard_200|Billboard_200|  chart , twenty-two Top 40 mainstream rock hits, and six Top 20 pop singles.   The band had experienced several short term lineup changes in the 1990s and 2000s that included vocalist  |John_Corabi|John_Corabi|  and drummers  |Randy_Castillo|Randy_Castillo|  and  |Samantha_Maloney|Samantha_Maloney| , both of whom filled in for Lee during his split from the band from 1999 to 2004.     The members of Mötley Crüe have often been noted for their  |hedonistic|Hedonism|  lifestyles and the  |androgynous|Androgynous|  persona they maintained. Following the hard rock and heavy metal origins on their first two albums,  Too Fast for Love  and  Shout at the Devil  , the release of their third album  Theatre of Pain  saw the band joining  |the_first_wave_of_glam_metal|Glam_Metalfirst_Wave| .   The band has also been known for their elaborate live performances, which features flame thrower guitars, roller coaster drum kits, and heavy use of pyrotechnics. Mötley Crües most recent studio album,  Saints of Los Angeles , was released on June 24, 2008. What was planned to be the bands final show took place on New Years Eve, December 31, 2015. The concert was filmed for a theatrical and  |Blu-ray|Blu-Ray|  release in 2016.       After two-and-a-half years of inactivity, Neil announced in September 2018 that Mötley Crüe had reunited and was working on new material.   On March 22, 2019, the band released four new songs on the  |soundtrack|The_Dirt_Soundtrack|  for their  |Netflix|Netflix|  biopic  The Dirt , based on the bands New York Times best-selling autobiography. The soundtrack went to Number 1 on the  |iTunes|Itunes|  All Genres Album Chart,  Number 3 on  Billboard  Top Album and Digital Album sales chart,  Number 10 on  |Billboard_Top_200|Billboard_200| , and Top 10 worldwide.  The autobiography returned to  |New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list|The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_List|  at Number 6 on Nonfiction Print and Number 8 on Nonfiction Combined Print & E-Book.          Too Fast for Love |London|London|  and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and vocalist/guitarist  |Greg_Leon|Greg_Leon| .  Lee had previously worked with Leon in a band called Suite 19  and the trio practiced together for some time; Leon eventually decided not to continue with them. Sixx and Lee then began a search for new members and soon met guitarist Bob Deal, better known as Mick Mars, after answering an advertisement that he placed in  The Recycler  that read: Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player available . Mars auditioned for Sixx and Lee, and was subsequently hired. Although a lead vocalist named ODean was auditioned,   Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at  |Charter_Oak_High_School|Charter_Oak_High_School|  in  |Covina,_California|Covina,_California| ,  and the two had performed in different bands on the  |garage_band|Garage_Band|  circuit. Upon seeing him perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, Mars suggested they have Neil join the band. At first Neil refused the offer, but as the other members of Rock Candy became involved in outside projects, Neil grew anxious to try something else. Lee asked another time, Neil was hired on April 1, 1981, and the band played their first gig at the Starwood nightclub on April 24.       The newly formed band did not yet have a name. Sixx has said that he told his bandmates that he was thinking about calling the band Christmas . The other members were not very receptive to that idea. Then, while trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident that occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group a motley looking crew . He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as Mottley Cru. After modifying the spelling slightly, Mötley Crüe was eventually selected as the bands name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of  |metal_umlauts|Metal_Umlaut| , supposedly inspired by the German beer  |Löwenbräu|Löwenbräu| , which the members were drinking at the time.  Other than the periods of February 1992 to September 1996 and from March 1999 to September 2004, the line up of Neil, Sixx, Lee, and Mars remained the same.      The band soon met its first manager, Allan Coffman, the thirty-eight-year-old brother-in-law of a friend of Marss driver.  The bands first release was the single Stick to Your Guns/Toast of the Town , which was released on its own record label,  |Leathür_Records|Leathür_Records| , which had a pressing and distribution deal with Greenworld Distribution in  |Torrance,_California|Torrance,_California| . In November 1981, its debut album  Too Fast for Love  was self-produced and released on Leathür, selling 20,000 copies. Coffmans assistant  |Eric_Greif|Eric_Greif|  set up a tour of Canada,   . Retrieved October 2, 2009. while Coffman and Greif used Mötley Crües success in the Los Angeles club scene to negotiate with several record labels, eventually signing a recording contract with  |Elektra_Records|Elektra_Records|  in early 1982. The debut album was then re-mixed by producer  |Roy_Thomas_Baker|Roy_Thomas_Baker|  and re-released on August 20, 1982—two months after its Canadian  |Warner_Music_Group|Warner_Music_Group|  release using the original Leathür mixes—to coincide with the tour.       During the Crüesing Through Canada Tour 82 , there were several widely publicized incidents. First, the band was arrested and then released at  |Edmonton_International_Airport|Edmonton_International_Airport|  for wearing their spiked stage wardrobe through customs, and for Neil arriving with a small carry-on filled with porn magazines ; both were staged  |PR|Public_Relations|  stunts. Customs eventually had the confiscated items destroyed. Second, while playing Scandals Disco in  |Edmonton|Edmonton| , a spurious bomb threat against the band made the front page of the  Edmonton Journal   on June 9, 1982; Lee and assistant band manager Greif were interviewed by police as a result. This too ended up being a staged PR stunt perpetrated by Greif. Lastly, Lee threw a television set from an upper story window of the Sheraton Caravan Hotel. Canadian rock magazine Music Express noted that the band was banned for life from the city. Despite the tour ending prematurely in financial disaster, it was the basis for the bands first international press.    In 1983, the band changed management from Coffman to Doug Thaler and  |Doc_McGhee|Doc_Mcghee| . McGhee is best known for managing  |Bon_Jovi|Bon_Jovi|  and later  |Kiss|Kiss| , starting with their reunion tour in 1996. Greif subsequently sued all parties in a Los Angeles Superior Court action that dragged on for several years, and coincidentally later re-surfaced as manager of Sixxs former band,  |London|London| . Coffman himself was sued by several investors to whom he had sold stock in the band , including  |Michigan|Michigan| -based Bill Larson. Coffman eventually declared bankruptcy, as he had mortgaged his home at least three times to cover band expenses.       The band became rapidly successful in the United States after playing at the  |US_Festival|Us_Festival|  and also with the aid of the new medium of  |MTV|Mtv| . Their second album,  Shout at the Devil , was released in September 1983.  The album represented the bands mainstream breakthrough and would eventually be certified 4x platinum.  They then gained the attention of heavy metal legend  |Ozzy_Osbourne|Ozzy_Osbourne|  and found themselves as the opening act for Osbourne on his 1984  |Bark_at_the_Moon_Tour|Bark_At_The_Moon_Tour| . The band members were well known for their backstage antics, outrageous clothing, extreme high-heeled boots, heavily applied make-up, and seemingly endless abuse of alcohol and drugs as well.      The band members also had their share of scrapes with the law. On December 8, 1984, Neil was driving home from a liquor run in his  |De_Tomaso_Pantera|De_Tomaso_Pantera|  which ended in a head-on collision; his passenger,  |Hanoi_Rocks|Hanoi_Rocks|  drummer  |Nicholas_Razzle_Dingley|Razzle| , was killed.  Neil, charged with a  |DUI|Driving_Under_The_Influence|  and  |vehicular_manslaughter|Manslaughtervehicular_Or_Intoxication_Manslaughter| , was sentenced to 30 days in jail and subsequently sued for $2,500,000. The short jail term was negotiated by his lawyers, enabling Neil to tour and pay the civil suit.  The bands third album  Theatre of Pain  was released in June 1985 and dedicated in Dingleys honor, and it started a new  |glam_metal|Glam_Metal|  phase in the bands style. Harrison 2011, p. 40. The band would later release two  |box_sets|Box_Set|  titled  |Music_to_Crash_Your_Car_To|Mötley_Crüe_Discography|  .      The bands fourth album,  Girls, Girls, Girls , was released in May 1987 and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200.  Sixx has said in interviews that he believes the album would have debuted at number 1 if not for behind the scenes maneuvering by  |Whitney_Houstons|Whitney_Houston|  record label.      On December 23, 1987, Sixx suffered a heroin overdose. He was declared legally dead on the way to the hospital, but the paramedic, who was a Crüe fan,  |revived|Cardiopulmonary_Resuscitation|  Sixx with two shots of adrenaline.  His two minutes in death were the inspiration for the song  |Kickstart_My_Heart|Kickstart_My_Heart|  , which peaked at No.  16 on the Mainstream U.S. chart, and which was featured on the 1989 U.S. number one album  Dr. Feelgood . From 1986 to 1987, Sixx kept a daily diary of his heroin addiction and eventually entered rehab in January 1988. In 2006, Sixx published his diaries as a best selling novel:  The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star , and in 2007, Sixxs side project band  |Sixx:A.M.|Sixx:A.M.|  released  The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack  as a musical parallel to the novel.      In 1988, controversy again hit the band in the form of a lawsuit by Matthew Trippe. Trippe claimed that Sixx was hospitalized in 1983 after a car crash involving drugs and that he had been hired as Sixxs  |doppelgänger|Doppelgänger| . The suit was regarding the loss of royalties from his time in Mötley Crüe and the case was not closed until 1993 when Trippe dropped his charges and disappeared from public view.      Their decadent lifestyles almost shattered the band until managers Thaler and McGhee pulled an intervention and refused to allow the band to tour in Europe, fearing that some would come back in bodybags . Shortly after, all the band members except for Mars underwent drug rehabilitation; Mars cleaned up on his own.     After finding sobriety in 1989, Mötley Crüe reached its peak popularity with the release of their fifth album, the  |Bob_Rock|Bob_Rock| -produced  Dr. Feelgood , on September 1, 1989. On October 14 of that year, it became a No.  1 album and stayed on the charts for 114  weeks after its release. The band members each stated in interviews that, due in no small part to their collective push for sobriety, Dr. Feelgood was their most solid album musically to that point, and indeed, it was their best selling album to date. The title track and Kickstart My Heart were both nominated for Grammys in the Best Hard Rock Category.  The band did find some success at the  |American_Music_Awards|American_Music_Award| , as Dr. Feelgood was nominated twice for Favorite Hard Rock/Metal Award, losing once to  |Guns_N_Roses|Guns_N_Roses|   Appetite for Destruction , but winning the following year, beating out  |Aerosmiths|Aerosmith|   Pump  and  |Poisons|Poison|   Flesh & Blood . Mötley Crüe was also nominated twice for Favorite Hard Rock/Metal Artist.      In 1989, McGhee was fired after the band alleged he had broken several promises that he made in relation to the  |Moscow_Music_Peace_Festival|Moscow_Music_Peace_Festival| , including giving his other band,  |Bon_Jovi|Bon_Jovi| , advantages in terms of slot placement. Thaler then assumed the role of sole band manager.      In April 1990, Lee suffered a concussion during a mishap involving a rappelling drum kit stunt during a live concert in  |New_Haven,_Connecticut|New_Haven,_Connecticut| .      On October 1, 1991, the bands first compilation album,  Decade of Decadence 81-91 , was released. It peaked at No.  2 on the  |Billboard_200|Billboard_200|  album chart. It was reportedly designed as just something for the fans while the band worked on the next all new album.        After Decade of Decadence, Neil left in February 1992, at a time when other bands in the 1980s  |glam_metal|Glam_Metal|  scene  broke up amid the advent of  |grunge|Grunge| . Controversy persists over whether Neil was fired or quit. Sixx has long maintained that Neil quit. However, Neil insists that he was fired. Any band has its little spats, Neil observed in 2000, and this one basically just stemmed from a bunch of fuck yous in a rehearsal studio. It went from I quit to Youre fired ... It was handled idiotically. The management just let one of the biggest bands in the world break up.      In the running for the vacant frontman position was  |Kik_Tracee|Kik_Tracee|  vocalist  |Stephen_Shareaux|Stephen_Shareaux| .   Ultimately Neil was replaced by  |John_Corabi|John_Corabi|  . Although Mötleys  |self-titled|Mötley_Crüe|  March 1994 release made the Billboard top ten , the album was a commercial failure. It also prompted negative reactions from many fans due to Neils absence and its sound. Corabi suggested the band work with Neil, believing the latter would always be seen as the voice of the band. This eventually resulted in his own firing in 1996.  Corabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with Mötley Crüe. Corabi said: my record was the first record that they had done that didnt go platinum, didnt make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked .      The band reunited with Neil in 1997,  after their current manager, Allen Kovac, and Neils manager, Bert Stein, set up a meeting between Neil, Lee, and Sixx. Agreeing to leave their egos at the door, the band released  Generation Swine . Although it debuted at No.  4, and in spite of a live performance at the American Music Awards, the album was a commercial failure, due in part to lack of support from their label.  The band soon left Elektra and created their own  |Mötley_Records|Mötley_Records| .      In 1998, Mötleys contractual ties with Elektra had expired, putting the band in total control of their future, including the ownership of the master recordings of all of their albums. Announcing the end of their relationship with Elektra, the band became one of the few groups to own and control their publishing and music catalog. They are one of a only handful of artists to own the masters to their material and reportedly did so by being the biggest pain they could be until Elektra got fed up and handed over the rights in order to get the band off their label. In 1999, the band rereleased all their albums, dubbed as Crücial Crüe . These limited-edition digital remasters included demos, plus live, instrumental, and previously unreleased tracks.  Mötley released their compilation  Greatest Hits  in late 1998, featuring two new songs, Bitter Pill and Enslaved. In 1999 the band released  Supersonic and Demonic Relics , an updated version of Decade of Decadence featuring the original songs from that album and several previously unreleased B-sides and remixes.       In 1999, Lee quit to pursue a solo career, due to increasing tensions with Neil. All we got was a call from his attorney saying he wasnt coming back, recalled the singer. He wasnt into rock n roll anymore. He even said that rock is dead ... It all happened during a void in Mötley. We werent even rehearsing, so it was no big deal.      Lee was replaced by former  |Ozzy_Osbourne|Ozzy_Osbourne|  drummer and longtime friend of the band  |Randy_Castillo|Randy_Castillo| . The band released  New Tattoo  in July 2000. Before the ensuing tour commenced, Castillo became ill with what was later determined to be cancer. The band brought in former  |Hole|Hole|  drummer  |Samantha_Maloney|Samantha_Maloney|  for the Maximum Rock tour with  |Megadeth|Megadeth|   as Castillo concentrated on his health. However, he lost his fight with cancer on March 26, 2002.  Soon after, the band went on hiatus.      While the band was on hiatus, Sixx played in side projects  |58|58|  and  |Brides_of_Destruction|Brides_Of_Destruction| .  Neil was featured on the first season of VH1s reality show  The Surreal Life ,  and had his own special titled Remaking Vince Neil , which focused on his solo career. Mars, who suffers from a hereditary form of arthritis which causes extensive spinal pain called  |ankylosing_spondylitis|Ankylosing_Spondylitis| ,  went into seclusion in 2001 dealing with health issues. Lee went on to form  |Methods_of_Mayhem|Methods_Of_Mayhem|   and also performed as a solo artist during this time.      A 2001 autobiography titled  The Dirt  presented Mötley as the worlds most notorious rock band. The book made the top ten on  The New York Times Best Seller list  and spent ten weeks there, and would return to the list after the film adaptation was released in spring 2019.           A promoter in England, Mags Revell, began clamoring for a Mötley Crüe reunion, ostensibly presenting himself as the voice of anxious fans waiting for more from the band. After meeting with management several times, in September 2004, Sixx announced that he and Neil had returned to the studio and had begun recording new material. In December 2004, the four original members announced a reunion tour, staging an announcement event in which they arrived at the Hollywood Palladium in a hearse.  The tour began on February 14, 2005, in  |San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico|San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico| .  The resulting compilation album,  Red, White & Crüe , was released in February 2005. It features the band members favorite original songs plus three new tracks,  |If_I_Die_Tomorrow|If_I_Die_Tomorrow|  ,  |Sick_Love_Song|Sick_Love_Song|  , and a cover of  |the_Rolling_Stones|The_Rolling_Stones|  classic  |Street_Fighting_Man|Street_Fighting_Man|  . A small controversy was caused when it was suggested that neither Lee nor Mars played on the new tracks . However, a  |VH1|Vh1|  documentary of the bands reunion later showed that Lee did indeed play on some of the tracks. The Japanese release of Red, White & Crüe includes an extra new track titled Im a Liar . Red, White & Crüe charted at No.  6 and has since gone platinum.      On New Years Eve 2004 the band appeared on a live episode of  The Tonight Show . Neil yelled an obscenity during the performance, leading to an  |FCC|Fcc|  investigation.  The  |NBC|Nbc|  network responded by banning the band, leading to the band subsequently suing the network, claiming they were being unfairly punished.  The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court and the band made several subsequent appearances on the network.      In 2005, Mötley Crüe was involved in an animation-comedy spoof Disaster!,  which was written by Paul Benson and Matt Sullivan and which was used as the introduction film to concerts on their Carnival of Sins tour.      In 2006, Mötley Crüe went on the  |Route_of_All_Evil_Tour|Route_Of_All_Evil_Tour| , co-headlining with  |Aerosmith|Aerosmith|  and taking performers from  |Lucent_Dossier_Experience|Lucent_Dossier_Experience|  on the road with them. This was another well-attended tour following the Carnival of Sins tour of 2005. In June 2007, Mötley Crüe set out on a small European tour. A lawsuit was filed by Neil, Mars and Sixx against  |Carl_Stubner|Carl_Stubner| , Lees manager. The three sued him for contracting for Lee to appear on two unsuccessful reality shows the band claim hurt its image.  It was later reported on Motley.com that the lawsuit had been settled.      Saints of Los Angeles Other litigation between the parties also ensued in Nevada. In July 2009, lawyers for both sides announced that the disputes had been amicably resolved through a global settlement .      Mötley Crües ninth studio album, titled  Saints of Los Angeles , was released in Japan on June 17, 2008, and in America on June 24, 2008. The album was originally titled The Dirt, as it was loosely based on the bands autobiography of the same name, but the title was later changed. In the US, the album was released by  |Eleven_Seven_Music|Eleven_Seven_Music| . Eleven Seven also took over US distribution of their back catalog.      In mid-2008, Mötley Crüe headlined the popular  |Crüe_Fest|Crüe_Fest|  music festival, which included opening acts  |Buckcherry|Buckcherry| ,  |Papa_Roach|Papa_Roach| ,  |Trapt|Trapt| , and  |Sixx:A.M.|Sixx:A.M.|       The Dirt, a movie based on the book written by Mötley Crüe and  |Neil_Strauss|Neil_Strauss|  was announced in 2009 but it was not released until 2019.          iTunes picked  |Saints_of_Los_Angeles|Saints_Of_Los_Angeles|  in their Best of 2008 in the Rock category as the number one song; the song was also nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Hard Rock Performance category.

Additionally, the entire  Dr. Feelgood  album was released as downloadable content in Rock Band, excluding T.n.T. . The song Saints of Los Angeles was also briefly available for purchase exclusively through Rock Band, making Motley Crue the first band to release a single exclusively through a video game.      The band played at the  |Download_Festival|Download_Festival|  at  |Donington_Park|Donington_Park|  , playing on the second stage on Friday night.

During the Australian leg of The Tour with Kiss, a rumor was circulated that the members of Mötley Crüe had discussed the bands retirement and had also agreed upon when it would be, supposedly being sooner than most had anticipated.     On January 28, 2014, at the conference inside Beachers Madhouse Theater in Hollywood, Mötley Crüe announced the full details of their retirement, including a tour initially spanning 70 North American dates, with  |Alice_Cooper|Alice_Cooper|  playing as a special guest. The tour commenced in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 2, 2014. The band members had signed a cessation of touring agreement , which prevented them from touring under the Mötley Crüe name beyond the end of 2015. The tour also served to promote the country-music album  Nashville Outlaws: A Tribute to Mötley Crüe , which was released in mid-2014, and their movie The Dirt, based on the book  The Dirt , due for release in 2015 by  |Focus_Features|Focus_Features|  and directed by  |Jeff_Tremaine|Jeff_Tremaine| .    Rockcellarmagazine.com . Retrieved on April 11, 2014.      In a later interview, Sixx talked about the possibility of releasing new music, saying that We have music written, its not put together yet . He also speculated that the band would release it in a song-by-song format as opposed to a full-length album format, elaborating with Its hard, to be honest with you, to spend six nine months to write eleven songs—all those lyrics ... everything ... the vocals, the guitars, the bass, the sonics, the mixing, the mastering, the artwork. ... You put it out and nothing because now people cherry-pick songs. So we go, Why dont we write songs and find vehicles to get one, two or four songs to ten million people rather than eleven songs to a hundred thousand people.  However, Sixx later announced that the band will not be releasing another album before their retirement.     During the tour, they played a new song All Bad Things over the speakers throughout the venue before they took the stage.
