      Microscopium  is a minor  |constellation|Constellation|  in the  |southern_celestial_hemisphere|Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere| , one of twelve created in the 18th century by French  |astronomer|Astronomer| |_Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille|Nicolas_Louis_De_Lacaille|  and one of several depicting scientific instruments. The name is a  |Latin|Latin| ised form of the  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|  word for  |microscope|Microscope| . Its  |stars|Star|  are faint and hardly visible from most of the non-tropical  |Northern_Hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| .     The constellations brightest star is  |Gamma_Microscopii|Gamma_Microscopii|  of  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  4.68, a yellow giant 2.5 times the Suns mass located 223 ± 8  light-years distant. It passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly disturbing the outer Solar System. Two star systems— |WASP_7|Wasp_7|  and  |HD_205739|Hd_Nbsp_205739| —have been determined to have  |planets|Exoplanet| , while two others—the young  |red_dwarf|Red_Dwarf|  star  |AU_Microscopii|Au_Microscopii|  and the sunlike  |HD_202628|Hd_202628| —have  |debris_disks|Debris_Disk| . AU Microscopii and the binary red dwarf system  |AT_Microscopii|At_Microscopii|  are probably a wide triple system and members of the  |Beta_Pictoris_moving_group|Beta_Pictoris_Moving_Group| . Nicknamed Speedy Mic ,  |BO_Microscopii|Bo_Microscopii|  is a star with an extremely fast rotation period of 9  hours, 7  minutes.       Microscopium is a small constellation bordered by  |Capricornus|Capricornus|  to the north,  |Piscis_Austrinus|Piscis_Austrinus|  and  |Grus|Grus|  to the east,  |Sagittarius|Sagittarius|  to the west, and  |Indus|Indus|  to the south, touching on  |Telescopium|Telescopium|  to the southwest. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is Mic.  The official constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments . In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between −27.45° and −45.09°.  The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude  |45°N|45Th_Parallel_North| .   Given that its brightest stars are of fifth magnitude, the constellation is invisible to the naked eye in areas with  |polluted|Light_Pollution|  skies.                   French astronomer  |Nicolas_Louis_de_Lacaille|Nicolas_Louis_De_Lacaille|  charted and designated ten stars with the  |Bayer_designations|Bayer_Designation| |_Alpha|Alpha_Microscopii|  through to  |Iota|Iota_Microscopii|  in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi turned out to be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it  |Nu_Microscopii|Nu_Microscopii| .  |Francis_Baily|Francis_Baily|  considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 Catalogus Britannicus, John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii,  |HR_8076|2_Piscis_Austrini| ,  |HR_8110|3_Piscis_Austrini|  and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellations borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to  |apparent_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|   6.5.     Depicting the eyepiece of the microscope is  |Gamma_Microscopii|Gamma_Microscopii| ,  which—at magnitude of  4.68—is the brightest star in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow  |giant|Giant_Star|  of  |spectral_type|Stellar_Classificationspectral_Types|  G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun.  Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 223 ± 8 light years from Earth.  At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the  |Oort_cloud|Oort_Cloud| .   |Alpha_Microscopii|Alpha_Microscopii|  is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90.  Located 400 ± 30 light-years away from Earth,  it has swollen to 17.5  times the diameter of the Sun.  Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5  cm telescopes,   though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system.  |Epsilon_Microscopii|Epsilon_Microscopii|  lies 166 ± 5 light-years away,  and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V.   |Theta_1_|Theta1_Microscopii|  and  |Theta_2_Microscopii|Theta2_Microscopii|  make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class  |magnetic_spectrum_variable_stars|Alpha²_Canum_Venaticorum_Variable|  with strong metallic lines, similar to  |Cor_Caroli|Cor_Caroli| . They mark the constellations specimen slide.     Many notable objects are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. AX Microscopii, better known as  |Lacaille_8760|Lacaille_8760| , is a  |red_dwarf|Red_Dwarf|  which lies only 12.9  light-years from the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| . At magnitude 6.68, it is the brightest red dwarf in the sky.   |BO_Microscopii|Bo_Microscopii|  is a rapidly rotating star that has 80% the diameter of the Sun. Nicknamed Speedy Mic , it has a rotation period of 9  hours 7  minutes.  An active star, it has prominent  |stellar_flares|Solar_Flare|  that average 100  times stronger than those of the Sun, and are emitting energy mainly in the X-ray and ultraviolet bands of the spectrum.  It lies 218 ± 4 light-years away from the Sun.   |AT_Microscopii|At_Microscopii|  is a binary star system, both members of which are flare star red dwarfs. The system lies close to and may form a very wide triple system with  |AU_Microscopii|Au_Microscopii| ,  a young star which appears to be a  |planetary_system|Planetary_System|  in the making with a  |debris_disk|Debris_Disk| . The three stars are candidate members of the  |Beta_Pictoris_moving_group|Beta_Pictoris_Moving_Group| , one of the nearest  |associations_of_stars|Stellar_Kinematics|  that share a common motion through space.      The  |Astronomical_Society_of_Southern_Africa|Astronomical_Society_Of_Southern_Africa|  in 2003 reported that observations of four of the  |Mira_variables|Mira_Variable|  in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete.  Two of them— |R|R_Microscopii|  and  |S_Microscopii|S_Microscopii| —are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers,  and the other two,  |U|U_Microscopii|  and  |RY_Microscopii|Ry_Microscopii| , are more difficult still. Another red giant,  |T_Microscopii|T_Microscopii| , is a  |semiregular_variable|Semiregular_Variable_Star|  that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days.  Of apparent magnitude 11,  |DD_Microscopii|Dd_Microscopii|  is a  |symbiotic_star|Symbiotic_Star|  system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and  |white_dwarf|White_Dwarf|  in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low  |metallicity|Metallicity| . Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the  |galactic_halo|Galactic_Halo|  of the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way| .       |HD_205739|Hd_205739|  is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22  times as massive and 2.3  times as luminous as the Sun. It has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 280  days that was discovered by the  |radial_velocity|Methods_Of_Detecting_Extrasolar_Planetsradial_Velocity|  method.   |WASP_7|Wasp_7|  is a star of spectral type F5V with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, about 1.28  times as massive as the Sun. Its  |hot_Jupiter|Hot_Jupiter|  planet— |WASP_7b|Wasp_7B| —was discovered by  |transit_method|Methods_Of_Detecting_Extrasolar_Planetstransit_Method|  and found to orbit the star every 4.95  days.   |HD_202628|Hd_202628|  is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its inner edge is sharply defined, indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158  AU from the star.           Describing Microscopium as totally unremarkable , astronomer  |Patrick_Moore|Patrick_Moore|  concluded there was nothing of interest for amateur observers.   |NGC_6925|Ngc_6925|  is a  |barred_spiral_galaxy|Barred_Spiral_Galaxy|  of apparent magnitude 11.3 which is lens-shaped, as it lies almost edge-on to observers on Earth, 3.7 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Microscopii.   |SN_2011ei|Sn_2011Ei| , a  |Type_II_Supernova|Supernovatype_Ii|  in NGC 6925, was discovered by Stu Parker in  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  in July 2011.   |NGC_6923|Ngc_6923|  lies nearby and is a magnitude fainter still.  The  |Microscopium_Void|Microscopium_Void|  is a roughly rectangular region of relatively empty space, bounded by incomplete sheets of galaxies from other voids.  The  |Microscopium_Supercluster|Microscopium_Supercluster|  is an overdensity of galaxy clusters that was first noticed in the early 1990s. The component Abell clusters  |3695|Abell_3695|  and  |3696|Abell_3696|  are likely to be gravitationally bound, while the relations of Abell clusters  |3693|Abell_3693|  and  |3705|Abell_3705|  in the same field are unclear.           The  |Microscopids|Microscopids|  are a minor  |meteor_shower|Meteor_Shower|  that appear from June to mid-July.        The stars that comprise Microscopium are in a region previously considered the hind feet of Sagittarius, a neighbouring constellation.   |John_Ellard_Gore|John_Ellard_Gore|  wrote that  |al_Sufi|Al_Sufi|  seems to have reported that  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  had seen the stars but he did not pinpoint their positions.  Microscopium itself was introduced in 1751–52 by Lacaille with the French name le Microscope,   after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the  |Cape_of_Good_Hope|Cape_Of_Good_Hope| . He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the  |Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere|Southern_Celestial_Hemisphere|  not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the  |Age_of_Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment| . Commemorating the  |compound_microscope|Optical_Microscopecompound_Microscope| ,  the Microscopes name had been Latinised by Lacaille to Microscopium by 1763.
