      In  |linguistics|Linguistics| , conjugation  is the creation of derived forms of a  |verb|Verb|  from its  |principal_parts|Principal_Parts|  by  |inflection|Inflection|  . Verbs may inflect for  |grammatical_categories|Grammatical_Category|  such as  |person|Grammatical_Person| ,  |number|Grammatical_Number| ,  |gender|Grammatical_Gender| ,  |tense|Grammatical_Tense| ,  |aspect|Grammatical_Aspect| ,  |mood|Grammatical_Mood| ,  |voice|Grammatical_Voice| ,  |case|Grammatical_Case| ,  |possession|Possession| ,  |definiteness|Definiteness| ,  |politeness|Politeness| ,  |causativity|Causative| ,  |clusivity|Clusivity| ,  |interrogativity|Interrogative| ,  |transitivity|Transitivity| ,  |valency|Valency| ,  |polarity|Affirmation_And_Negation| ,  |telicity|Telicity| ,  |volition|Volition| ,  |mirativity|Mirativity| ,  |evidentiality|Evidentiality| ,  |animacy|Animacy| , associativity,   |pluractionality|Pluractionality| , and  |reciprocity|Reciprocal| . Verbs may also be affected by  |agreement|Agreement| ,  |polypersonal_agreement|Polypersonal_Agreement| ,  |incorporation|Incorporation| ,  |noun_class|Noun_Class| ,  |noun_classifiers|Noun_Classifier| , and  |verb_classifiers|Verb_Classifier| .   |Agglutinative|Agglutinative|  and  |polysynthetic_languages|Polysynthetic_Language|  tend to have the most complex conjugations albeit some  |fusional_languages|Fusional_Language|  such as  |Archi|Archi_Language|  can also have extremely complex conjugation. Typically the principal parts are the  |root|Root|  and/or several modifications of it . All the different forms of the same verb constitute a  |lexeme|Lexeme| , and the  |canonical|Canon|  form of the verb that is conventionally used to represent that lexeme is called a  |lemma|Lemma| .     The term conjugation is applied only to the inflection of verbs, and not of other parts of speech . Also it is often restricted to denoting the formation of  |finite_forms|Finite_Verb|  of a verb â€“ these may be referred to as conjugated forms, as opposed to  |non-finite_forms|Non-Finite_Verb| , such as the  |infinitive|Infinitive|  or  |gerund|Gerund| , which tend not to be marked for most of the grammatical categories.     Conjugation is also the traditional name for a group of verbs that share a similar conjugation pattern in a particular language . For example,  |Latin|Latin|  is said to have four conjugations of verbs. This means that any  |regular|Regular_Verb|  Latin verb can be conjugated in any person, number, tense, mood, and voice by knowing which of the four conjugation groups it belongs to, and its principal parts. A verb that does not follow all of the standard conjugation patterns of the language is said to be an  |irregular_verb|Irregular_Verb| . The system of all conjugated variants of a particular verb or class of verbs is called a verb paradigm; this may be presented in the form of a conjugation table.        |Indo-European_languages|Indo-European_Languages|  usually  |inflect|Inflection|  verbs for several grammatical categories in complex  |paradigms|Inflectional_Paradigm| , although some, like English, have simplified verb conjugation to a large extent. Below is the conjugation of the verb to be in the present tense , in  |English|English_Language| ,  |German|German_Language| ,  |Yiddish|Yiddish_Language| ,  |Dutch|Dutch_Language| ,  |Afrikaans|Afrikaans| ,  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language| ,  |Faroese|Faroese_Language| ,  |Swedish|Swedish_Language| ,  |Norwegian|Norwegian_Language| ,  |Latvian|Latvian_Language| ,  |Bulgarian|Bulgarian_Language| ,  |Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian| ,  |Polish|Polish_Language| ,  |Slovenian|Slovenian_Language| ,  |Macedonian|Macedonian_Language| ,  |Urdu|Urdu|  or  |Hindi|Hindi| ,  |Persian|Persian_Language| ,  |Latin|Latin| ,  |French|French_Language| ,  |Italian|Italian_Language| ,  |Spanish|Spanish_Language| ,  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language| ,  |Russian|Russian_Language| ,  |Albanian|Albanian_Language| ,  |Armenian|Armenian_Language| ,  |Irish|Irish_Language| ,  |Ukrainian|Ukrainian_Language| ,  |Ancient_Attic_Greek|Ancient_Attic_Greek|  and  |Modern_Greek|Modern_Greek| . This is usually the most irregular verb. The similarities in corresponding verb forms may be noticed. Some of the conjugations may be disused, like the English  thou -form, or have additional meanings, like the English  you -form, which can also stand for second person singular or be  |impersonal|Generic_You| .
