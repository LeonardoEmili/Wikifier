      RuneQuest is a  |fantasy|Fantasy| |_role_playing_game|Role_Playing_Game|  created by  |Steve_Perrin|Steve_Perrin| , set in  |Greg_Staffords|Greg_Stafford|  mythical world of  |Glorantha|Glorantha| , and first published in 1978 by  |Chaosium|Chaosium| . RuneQuest is notable for its system, designed around  |percentile_dice|Percentile_Dice|  and with an early implementation of  |skill|Skill|  rules, which became the basis of numerous other games. There have been several editions of the game.       In 1975, game designer Greg Stafford released the fantasy board game  White Bear and Red Moon  , produced and marketed by  |Chaosium|Chaosium| , a game publishing company set up by Stafford specifically for the release of the game. In 1978, Chaosium published the first edition of RuneQuest, a role playing game set in the world of  |Glorantha|Glorantha|  from White Bear and Red Moon. A second edition, with various minor revisions, was released in 1980. RuneQuest quickly established itself as the second most popular fantasy role-playing game, after  Dungeons & Dragons .       In order to increase distribution and marketing of the game, Chaosium made a deal with  |Avalon_Hill|Avalon_Hill| , who published a third edition in 1984. Under the agreement struck, Avalon Hill took ownership of trademark for RuneQuest, while all Glorantha-related content required approval by Chaosium, who also retained the copyright of the rules text. In an attempt to also have a setting they could release freely, Avalon Hill also supported a new default setting, Fantasy Earth, based on fantasy interpretations of several eras of earths pre-modern history, including viking and ninja supplements. Later Avalon Hill published generic fantasy material.      A proposed fourth edition developed by Avalon Hill, titled RuneQuest: Adventures in Glorantha, was intended to return the tight RuneQuest/Glorantha relationship, but it was shelved mid-project in 1994 after Stafford refused permission, unhappy with Avalon Hills stewardship of the third edition. In response, Avalon Hill, as owners of the trademark, began development of a mechanically unrelated game originally titled RuneQuest: Slayers. However, when Avalon Hill was acquired by  |Hasbro|Hasbro|  in 1998, the project was canceled despite being near completion. The copyrights to the rules reverted to the authors, who released it for free as  RuneSlayers .     In 1998, Following the financial failure of the collectible card game  Mythos , Stafford, along with fellow shareholder Sandy Petersen, left the management of Chaosium . Stafford had formed a subsidiary company,  |Issaries_Inc_|Issaries_Inc_| , to manage the Glorantha property and took ownership of that company with him. He partnered with  |Robin_D_Laws|Robin_D_Laws|  to publish an all-new game system set in Glorantha called  Hero Wars  in 2000. It was later renamed  HeroQuest  in 2003 after the rights to that name, along with the RuneQuest trademark, were acquired from Hasbro by Issaries.      |Mongoose_Publishing|Mongoose_Publishing|  released a new edition of RuneQuest in August 2006 under a license from Issaries. This required that Mongoose recreate much of the function of prior editions without reusing the prior texts . The new rules were developed by a team led by Mongoose co-founder  |Matthew_Sprange|Matthew_Sprange| , and were released under the  |Open_Game_License|Open_Game_License| . The official setting takes place during the Second Age of Glorantha . In January 2010, Mongoose published a much-revised edition written by  |Pete_Nash|Pete_Nash|  and  |Lawrence_Whitaker|Lawrence_Whitaker|  called RuneQuest II, known as MRQ2 by fans.     In May 2011, Mongoose Publishing announced that they had parted company with Issaries. , May 23, 2011 In July 2011, The Design Mechanism, a company formed by Nash and Whitaker, announced that they had entered a licensing agreement with Issaries,  and would be producing a 6th edition of RuneQuest. RuneQuest 6th edition, released in July 2012, is largely an expansion of the Mongoose RuneQuest II rules aimed at providing rules that can be adapted to many fantasy or historical settings, and do not contain any specifically Gloranthan content .     In 2013, Stafford outright sold the Glorantha setting and RuneQuest and HeroQuest trademarks to  |Moon_Design_Publications|Moon_Design_Publications| , which had published the second edition of HeroQuest under license in 2009; Moon Design maintained Design Mechanisms RuneQuest license. In June 2015, following a series of financial issues at Chaosium, Stafford and Petersen retook control of the company. They in turn arranged a merger with Moon Design, which saw the Moon Design management team take over Chaosium. Shortly thereafter a new edition of RuneQuest, subtitled Roleplaying in Glorantha was announced. It is based on the Chaosium 2nd edition, drawing upon ideas from later editions.  They also successfully raised funds through  |Kickstarter|Kickstarter|  to produce a hardcover reprint of the 2nd edition and PDFs of its supplements as RuneQuest Classic.  The new edition of the game, officially referred to as RQG for short, was previewed on  |Free_RPG_Day|Free_Rpg_Day|  2017 with the release of a quickstart module.  The PDF of the full rules were released in May 2018, with the printed book to follow later that year.           As with most RPGs, players begin by making a  |player_character|Player_Character| . Player characters are devised through a number of dice rolls to represent physical, mental and spiritual characteristics.     Characters in RuneQuest gain power as they are used in play, but not to the degree that characters do in other fantasy RPGs. It is still possible for a weak character to slay a strong one through luck, tactics, or careful planning.       Both combat and non-combat actions use a percentile roll-under system to determine success of actions. The game features mechanics for critical hits and fumbling. For example, if a character has climbing at 35% and his player rolls 25 on a D100, the character has succeeded. However, a nuanced range of results existed in every die roll. If a die roll was 1/5 of the necessary percentile roll or less, it was a special success, and if it was 1/20 of the necessary roll or less it was a critical success. Very high rolls on the other hand, could be fumbles or spectacular failures if they were in the top 1/20 of possible failed rolls.       The games combat system was designed in an attempt to recreate designer Steve Perrins experience with live-action combat. Perrin experienced mock medieval combat through the  |Society_for_Creative_Anachronism|Society_For_Creative_Anachronism| . The player rolls against the characters combat skill. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the characters skill level, they have hit their target. The defender has the chance to roll to avoid the blow or parry it.     The RuneQuest combat system has a subsystem for hit location. Successful attacks are normally allocated randomly to a part of the targets body. In RuneQuest, a hit against a characters leg, weapon arm, or head has specific effects on the games mechanics and narrative. This was a unique part of the games combat system and helped to separate it from the more abstracted, hit-point-based combat of competitors such as Dungeons & Dragons.       Rules for skill advancement also use percentile dice. In a departure from the level-based advancement of Dungeons & Dragons, RuneQuest allowed characters to improve their abilities directly; the player needs to roll higher than the characters skill rating. For the climber example used earlier, the player would need to roll greater than 35 on a D100 in order to advance the characters skill. Thus, the better the character is at a skill the more difficult it is to improve.       Characters in RuneQuest are not divided into magic using and non-magic using characters. At the time of the games release, this was an unorthodox mechanic. Although all characters have access to magic, for practical  |gameplay_purposes|Game_Balance|  a characters magical strength is proportional to his or her connection to the divine or natural skill at sorcery. The exact divisions of magic vary from edition to edition, but most contain divisions such as Common Magic, Sorcery, Divine Magic, Spirit Magic, and Enchantments.       The RuneQuest rule book contained a large selection of fantasy monsters and their physical stats. As well as traditional fantasy staples , the book featured original creatures such as the goat-headed creatures called Broo. Some of its traditional fantasy creatures differed notably from the versions from other games , for example, Elves are humanoid plant life. Unlike other fantasy RPGs of the time, RuneQuest encouraged the use of monsters as player characters.          With the exception of the third and sixth editions, which still offered it as an option, the default setting for RuneQuest has been the world of  |Glorantha|Glorantha| . The well-developed background of the game offered a breadth of material for players and game masters to draw from. At a time when many RPG settings were cobbled together, RuneQuest offered players a vibrant living world, giving them a much more developed  |fictional_world|Fictional_World|  with established geography, history, and religion.       The original rules contained a map of an area called Dragon Pass, a region offered as the default setting for adventures. It is an extended upland, with not one but several passes through the surrounding mountains, each leading to different regions. This, together with the regional history, has led to a melting pot area, with unusually-high variety and concentrations of non-Human species, particularly for a largely-rural setting. The original RuneQuest game was set during a period of invasion, offering further opportunities for game scenarios.       One of the areas adjacent to Dragon Pass, touched upon in the original rulebook, was the Plains of Prax. It is an arid, even blasted region, hostile to all but the native peoples whose founding god, Waha, created the Survival Covenant by which they live. The tribes are Beast-Riders, each riding a different species ; the Great Tribes are: Bison, High Llama, Sable, Impala, and Morokanth . The Praxian tribes are inspired by ancient Mongol, Bedouin, Native American, and other nomadic tribal cultures.       A key element of RuneQuest flavor is a characters affiliation with a cult . Characters begin as lay members and progress through a series of membership levels, such as initiate or Rune Lord. This system offers narrative and mechanical benefits to players who chose to have their characters join a cult.     The basic rules described a handful of original and mythological gods. These were greatly expanded upon in the supplements  Cults of Prax  and Cults of Terror.       Supplements published for RuneQuest second edition include  |Plunder|Plunder| ,  |Runemasters|Runemasters| ,  |Foes|Foes| ,  The Gateway Bestiary ,  Griffin Mountain ,  City of Lei Tabor ,  Cults of Prax  and  Cults of Terror .       Dana Holm reviewed RuneQuest in  The Space Gamer  No. 19.  Holm commented that Since this game contains a logical system, almost anything can be added to the matrix it presents. A gem of a game. You wont be disappointed.      |Greg_Costikyan|Greg_Costikyan|  reviewed RuneQuest in  Ares Magazine  1, rating it a 7 out of 9.  Costikyan commented that RuneQuest is the most playable and elegant fantasy role-playing designed to date. Its only drawback is that it does not cover enough ground for a full-scale role-playing campaign, and is, perhaps, a bit simpler than experienced frpers would desire.     Forrest Johnson reviewed the 1980 boxed edition of RuneQuest in  The Space Gamer  No. 35.  Johnson commented that An experienced gamer, who probably bought the rules separately has no need of this edition. However, it might be of use to a newcomer.     In a 1996 reader poll conducted by Arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, RuneQuest was ranked 5th.      RuneQuest was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best.  |Jennell_Jaquays|Jennell_Jaquays|  commented, After RuneQuest and Glorantha, detailed fantasy worlds would become the norm, not the exception. Dragon Pass paved the way for TSRs Faerûn, better known as the Forgotten Realms, and Krynn, setting for the Dragonlance saga. But few would ever achieve the elegant but approachable rules complexity of the original RuneQuest or instill a fervent loyalty in fans that would span decades.        Chaosium reused the rules system developed in RuneQuest to form the basis of several other games. In 1980 the core of the RuneQuest system was published in a simplified form edited by Greg Stafford and  |Lynn_Willis|Lynn_Willis|  as  Basic Role-Playing . BRP is a  |generic_role_playing_game_system|Generic_Role_Playing_Game_System| , derived from the two first RuneQuest editions. It was used for many Chaosium role-playing games that followed RuneQuest, including:      Stormbringer     Call of Cthulhu     Worlds of Wonder     Superworld     ElfQuest     Ringworld     Pendragon     Hawkmoon     Nephilim      The science-fiction roleplaying game  Other Suns  by  |Fantasy_Games_Unlimited|Fantasy_Games_Unlimited| , 1983, used the Basic Role-Playing system as well.     Minor modifications of the BRP rules were introduced in every one of those games, to suit the flavor of each games universe.  Pendragon  used a 1-20 scale and 1d20 roll instead of a percentile scale and 1d100.   Prince Valiant: The Story-Telling Game  , which used coin tosses instead of dice rolls, is the only Chaosium-published role-playing game that does not use any variant of the BRP system.     In 2004, Chaosium released a print-on-demand version of the 3rd edition RuneQuest rules with the trademarks removed under the titles Basic Roleplaying Players Book, Basic Roleplaying Magic Book, and Basic Roleplaying Creatures Book. That same year, Chaosium began preparing a new edition of Basic Roleplaying, which was released in 2008 as a single, comprehensive 400 page book, incorporating material from many of their previous BRP system games.   The book offers many optional rules, as well as genre-specific advice for fantasy, horror, and science-fiction, but contains no setting-specific material.     After losing the license to use the RuneQuest name and Glorantha setting, Mongoose Publishing announced the release of a new series of books which are fully compatible with the RuneQuest II ruleset under the title of Legend. Legend was released in late 2011 under the  |Open_Gaming_License|Open_Gaming_License| . Mongoose titles for RuneQuest II were re-released as Legend-compatible books.  Similarly, after the announcement of the Chaosium/Moon Design merger, The Design Mechanism announced that RuneQuest 6th edition would continue to be published under the name Mythras.
