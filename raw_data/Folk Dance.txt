A folk dance is developed by people that reflect the life of the people of a certain country or region. Not all ethnic dances are folk dances. For example,  |ritual_dances|Ritual_Dance|  or dances of ritual origin are not considered to be folk dances. Ritual dances are usually called Religious dances because of their purpose.   The terms ethnic and traditional are used when it is required to emphasize the cultural roots of the dance. In this sense, nearly all folk dances are ethnic ones. If some dances, such as  |polka|Polka| , cross ethnic boundaries and even cross the boundary between folk and ballroom dance , ethnic differences are often considerable enough to mention.     They share some or all of the following attributes:     Dances are usually held at folk dance gatherings or social functions by people with little or no professional training, often to traditional music.   Dances not generally designed for public performance or the stage, though they may later be arranged and set for stage performances.   Execution dominated by an inherited tradition from various international cultures rather than innovation .   New dancers often learn informally by observing others or receiving help from others.   More controversially, some people define folk dancing as dancing for which there is no governing body or dancing for which there are no competitive or professional institutions. The term folk dance is sometimes applied to dances of historical importance in European culture and history; typically originating before the 20th century. For other cultures the terms ethnic dance or traditional dance are sometimes used, although the latter terms may encompass  |ceremonial_dances|Ceremonial_Dance| .     There are a number of modern dances, such as hip hop dance, that evolve spontaneously, but the term folk dance is generally not applied to them, and the terms street dance or vernacular dance are used instead. The term folk dance is reserved for dances which are to a significant degree bound by tradition and originated in the times when the distinction existed between the dances of common folk and the dances of the modern ballroom dances originated from folk ones.

Most country dances and ballroom dances originated from folk dances, with gradual refinement over the years.     People familiar with folk dancing can often determine what country a dance is from even if they have not seen that particular dance before.

For example, the  |German|Germany|  and  |Austria|Austria| n  |schuhplattling_dance|Schuhplattler|  consists of slapping the body and shoes in a fixed pattern, a feature that few other countries dances have.
