   Erbium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Er and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  68. A silvery-white solid metal when artificially isolated, natural erbium is always found in chemical combination with other elements. It is a  |lanthanide|Lanthanide| , a  |rare_earth_element|Rare_Earth_Element| , originally found in the  |gadolinite|Gadolinite|  mine in  |Ytterby|Ytterby|  in  |Sweden|Sweden| , from which it got its name.     Erbiums principal uses involve its pink-colored Er 3+ ions, which have optical fluorescent properties particularly useful in certain laser applications. Erbium-doped glasses or crystals can be used as optical amplification media, where Er 3+ ions are optically pumped at around 980 or  and then radiate light at  in stimulated emission. This process results in an unusually mechanically simple  |laser|Laser| |_optical_amplifier|Optical_Amplifier|  for signals transmitted by fiber optics. The  wavelength is especially important for  |optical_communications|Optical_Communications|  because standard single mode  |optical_fibers|Optical_Fibers|  have minimal loss at this particular wavelength.     In addition to optical fiber amplifier-lasers, a large variety of medical applications rely on the erbium ions  emission  when lit at another wavelength, which is highly absorbed in water in tissues, making its effect very superficial. Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is helpful in  |laser_surgery|Laser_Surgery| , and for the efficient production of steam which produces enamel ablation by common types of  |dental_laser|Dental_Laser| .              A  |trivalent|Valence|  element, pure erbium  |metal|Metal|  is malleable , soft yet stable in air, and does not  |oxidize|Oxidation|  as quickly as some other  |rare_earth_metals|Rare_Earth_Metals| . Its  |salts|Salt|  are rose-colored, and the element has characteristic sharp  |absorption_spectra|Absorption_Spectra|  bands in  |visible_light|Visible_Light| ,  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet| , and near  |infrared|Infrared| . Otherwise it looks much like the other rare earths. Its  |sesquioxide|Sesquioxide|  is called  |erbia|Erbia| . Erbiums properties are to a degree dictated by the kind and amount of impurities present. Erbium does not play any known biological role, but is thought to be able to stimulate  |metabolism|Metabolism| .      Erbium is  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic|  below 19  K,  |antiferromagnetic|Antiferromagnetic|  between 19 and 80 K and  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetic|  above 80  K.      Erbium can form propeller-shaped atomic clusters Er 3 N, where the distance between the erbium atoms is 0.35  nm. Those clusters can be isolated by encapsulating them into  |fullerene|Fullerene|  molecules, as confirmed by  |transmission_electron_microscopy|Transmission_Electron_Microscopy| .        Erbium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form  |erbium_oxide|Erbium_Oxide| |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  to form solutions containing hydrated Er ions, which exist as rose red 3+ hydration complexes:      :2 Er + 3 H 2 SO 4 → 2 Er 3+ + 3  + 3 H 2          Naturally occurring erbium is composed of 6 stable  |isotopes|Isotope| , , , , , , and , with  being the most abundant . 29  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  have been characterized, with the most stable being  with a  |half_life|Half_Life|  of ,  with a half-life of ,  with a half-life of ,  with a half-life of , and  with a half-life of . All of the remaining  |radioactive|Radioactive|  isotopes have half-lives that are less than , and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 4 minutes. This element also has 13  |meta_states|Meta_State| , with the most stable being  with a half-life of .      The isotopes of erbium range in  |atomic_weight|Atomic_Weight|  from   to  . The primary  |decay_mode|Decay_Mode|  before the most abundant stable isotope, , is  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture| , and the primary mode after is  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| . The primary  |decay_products|Decay_Product|  before  are element 67  isotopes, and the primary products after are element 69  isotopes.       Erbium  was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  by  |Carl_Gustaf_Mosander|Carl_Gustaf_Mosander|  in 1843.  Note: The first part of this article, which does NOT concern erbium, is a translation of: C. G. Mosander   Förhandlingar vid de Skandinaviske naturforskarnes tredje möte  vol. 3, pp. 387–398. Mosander was working with a sample of what was thought to be the single metal oxide  |yttria|Yttria| , derived from the mineral  |gadolinite|Gadolinite| . He discovered that the sample contained at least two metal oxides in addition to pure yttria, which he named  |erbia|Erbia|  and  |terbia|Terbia|  after the village of Ytterby where the gadolinite had been found. Mosander was not certain of the purity of the oxides and later tests confirmed his uncertainty. Not only did the yttria contain yttrium, erbium, and terbium; in the ensuing years, chemists, geologists and spectroscopists discovered five additional elements:  |ytterbium|Ytterbium| ,  |scandium|Scandium| ,  |thulium|Thulium| ,  |holmium|Holmium| , and  |gadolinium|Gadolinium| .      Erbia and terbia, however, were confused at this time. A spectroscopist mistakenly switched the names of the two elements during spectroscopy. After 1860, terbia was renamed erbia and after 1877 what had been known as erbia was renamed terbia. Fairly pure Er 2  |O|Oxygen|  3 was independently isolated in 1905 by  |Georges_Urbain|Georges_Urbain|  and  |Charles_James|Charles_James| . Reasonably pure erbium metal was not produced until 1934 when  |Wilhelm_Klemm|Wilhelm_Klemm|  and  |Heinrich_Bommer|Heinrich_Bommer|  reduced the  |anhydrous|Anhydrous| |_chloride|Chloride|  with  |potassium|Potassium|  vapor.  It was only in the 1990s that the price for Chinese-derived erbium oxide became low enough for erbium to be considered for use as a colorant in art glass.            The concentration of erbium in the Earth crust is about 2.8  mg/kg and in the sea water 0.9  ng/L.  This concentration is enough to make erbium about 45th in  |elemental_abundance_in_the_Earths_crust|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust| .     Like other rare earths, this element is never found as a free element in nature but is found bound in  |monazite|Monazite|  sand ores. It has historically been very difficult and expensive to separate rare earths from each other in their ores but  |ion_exchange|Ion_Exchange|  chromatography methods Early paper on the use of displacement ion-exchange chromatography to separate rare earths:  developed in the late 20th century have greatly brought down the cost of production of all rare-earth metals and their  |chemical_compounds|Chemical_Compound| .     The principal commercial sources of erbium are from the minerals  |xenotime|Xenotime|  and  |euxenite|Euxenite| , and most recently, the ion adsorption clays of southern China; in consequence, China has now become the principal global supplier of this element. In the high-yttrium versions of these ore concentrates, yttrium is about two-thirds of the total by weight, and erbia is about 4–5%. When the concentrate is dissolved in acid, the erbia liberates enough erbium ion to impart a distinct and characteristic pink color to the solution. This color behavior is similar to what Mosander and the other early workers in the lanthanides would have seen in their extracts from the gadolinite minerals of Ytterby.       Crushed minerals are attacked by hydrochloric or  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  that transforms insoluble rare-earth oxides into soluble chlorides or sulfates. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with caustic soda to pH 3–4.  |Thorium|Thorium|  precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with  |ammonium_oxalate|Ammonium_Oxalate|  to convert rare earths into their insoluble  |oxalates|Oxalate| . The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  that excludes one of the main components,  |cerium|Cerium| , whose oxide is insoluble in HNO 3 . The solution is treated with  |magnesium_nitrate|Magnesium_Nitrate|  to produce a crystallized mixture of  |double_salts|Double_Salt|  of rare-earth metals. The salts are separated by  |ion_exchange|Ion_Exchange| . In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Erbium metal is obtained from its oxide or salts by heating with  |calcium|Calcium|  at  under argon atmosphere.          Erbiums everyday uses are varied. It is commonly used as a  |photographic_filter|Filter| , and because of its resilience it is useful as a metallurgical additive.       A large variety of medical applications utilize erbium ions  emission , which is highly absorbed in water . Such shallow tissue deposition of laser energy is necessary for laser surgery, and the efficient production of steam for laser enamel ablation in dentistry.     Erbium-doped  |optical_silica_glass_fibers|Optical_Fibers|  are the active element in  |erbium_doped_fiber_amplifiers|Erbium_Doped_Fiber_Amplifier|  , which are widely used in  |optical_communications|Optical_Communications| .  The same fibers can be used to create fiber  |lasers|Lasers| . In order to work efficiently, erbium-doped fiber is usually co-doped with glass modifiers/homogenizers, often aluminum or phosphorus. These dopants help prevent clustering of Er ions and transfer the energy more efficiently between excitation light and the signal. Co-doping of optical fiber with Er and Yb is used in  |high_power_Er_Yb_fiber_lasers|Erbium_Ytterbium_Laser| . Erbium can also be used in  |erbium_doped_waveguide_amplifiers|Erbium_Doped_Waveguide_Amplifier| .       When added to  |vanadium|Vanadium|  as an  |alloy|Alloy| , erbium lowers hardness and improves workability.  An erbium- |nickel|Nickel|  alloy Er 3 Ni has an unusually high specific heat capacity at liquid-helium temperatures and is used in  |cryocoolers|Cryocoolers| ; a mixture of 65% Er 3  |Co|Cobalt|  and 35% Er 0.9  |Yb|Ytterbium|  0.1 Ni by volume improves the specific heat capacity even more.          |Erbium_oxide|Erbium_Oxide|  has a pink color, and is sometimes used as a colorant for  |glass|Glass| ,  |cubic_zirconia|Cubic_Zirconia|  and  |porcelain|Porcelain| . The glass is then often used in  |sunglasses|Sunglasses|  and cheap  |jewelry|Jewelry| . Stwertka, Albert. A Guide to the Elements, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 162.        Erbium is used in  |nuclear|Nuclear_Power|  technology in neutron-absorbing  |control_rods|Control_Rod| .        Erbium does not have a biological role, but erbium salts can stimulate  |metabolism|Metabolism| . Humans consume 1 milligram of erbium a year on average. The highest concentration of erbium in humans is in the  |bones|Bone| , but there is also erbium in the human  |kidneys|Kidneys|  and  |liver|Liver| .       Erbium is slightly toxic if ingested, but erbium compounds are not toxic. Metallic erbium in dust form presents a fire and explosion hazard.
