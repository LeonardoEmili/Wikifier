          Rurik , according to the 12th-century  Primary Chronicle , was a  |Varangian|Varangians|  chieftain of the  |Rus|Rus|  who in the year 862 gained control of  |Ladoga|Staraya_Ladoga| , and built the  |Holmgard|Holmgard|  settlement near  |Novgorod|Novgorod| . He is the founder of the  |Rurik_dynasty|Rurik_Dynasty| , which ruled the Kievan Rus and its successor states, including the  |Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow|Grand_Duchy_Of_Moscow|  and the  |Tsardom_of_Russia|Tsardom_Of_Russia| , until the 17th century. Christian Raffensperger and Norman W. Ingham, Rurik and the First Rurikids,  The American Genealogist , 82 , 1–13, 111–19.            The only information about Rurik is contained in the 12th-century  Primary Chronicle  written by one  |Nestor|Nestor_The_Chronicler| , which states that  |Chuds|Chud| , Eastern  |Slavs|Early_Slavs| ,  |Merias|Merias| ,  |Veses|Vepsians| , and  |Krivichs|Krivichs|  ...drove the Varangians back beyond the sea, refused to pay them tribute, and set out to govern themselves . Afterwards the tribes started fighting each other and decided to invite the Varangians, led by Rurik, to reestablish order. Rurik came in 860-862 along with his brothers  |Sineus_and_Truvor|Sineus_And_Truvor|  and a large retinue.     According to the Primary Chronicle, Rurik was one of  |the_Rus|Rus| , a  |Varangian|Varangian|  tribe likened by the chronicler to Danes, Swedes, Angles, and  |Gotlanders|Gotlander| . Sineus established himself at Beloozero , on the shores of lake Beloye, and Truvor at Izborsk . Truvor and Sineus died shortly after the establishment of their territories, and Rurik consolidated these lands into his own territory.     According to the entries in the Radzivil and  |Hypatian_Chronicles|Hypatian_Chronicles|  Ipat’ievskaia letopis’ 1962:14; Radzivilovskaia letopis’ 1989:16 under the years 862–864, Rurik’s first residence was in Ladoga. He later moved his seat of power to  |Novgorod|Novgorod| , a fort built not far from the source of the  |Volkhov_River|Volkhov_River| . The meaning of this place name in medieval Russian is new fortification, while the current meaning developed later.     Rurik remained in power until his death in 879. On his deathbed, Rurik bequeathed his realm to  |Oleg|Oleg_Of_Novgorod| , who belonged to his kin, and entrusted to Olegs hands his son  |Igor|Igor_Of_Kiev| , for he was very young. His successors  moved the capital to  |Kiev|Kiev|  and founded the state of  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus| , which persisted until the  |Mongol_invasion|Mongol_Invasion_Of_Russia|  in 1240. A number of extant princely families are patrilineally descended from Rurik, although the last  |Rurikid|Rurikid|  to rule Russia,  |Vasily_IV|Vasily_Iv| , died in 1612.         In the 20th century, archaeologists partly corroborated the chronicles version of events.   It was discovered that the settlement of  |Ladoga|Staraja_Ladoga| , whose foundation has been ascribed to Rurik, was actually established in the mid-9th century, although doubt is now cast on this by the  |dendrochronological|Dendrochronology|  evidence that Ladoga existed by the mid-8th century.  |Earthenware|Earthenware| , household utensils, and types of buildings from the period of Ruriks purported foundation correspond to patterns then prevalent in  |Jutland|Jutland| . but mostly the excavations denied most of the chronicles data about Ruriks arrival when it was apparent that the old settlement stretched to the mid-8th century and the excavated objects were mostly of  |Finno-Ugric|Finno-Ugric_Peoples|  and  |Slavic|Slavic_People|  origin, dated to the mid-8th century, which showed the settlement was not Scandinavian from the beginning.                 The name Rurik is accepted to be a form of the Old Norse name  Hrærekr . This has been taken as evidence that Rurik was in some way ethnically Scandinavian. Omeljan Pritsak, Rus , in https://books.google.es/books?idd-XiZO8V4qUC Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia, ed. by Phillip Pulsiano , pp. 555-56. The only similarly named figure described in the Carolingian  Annales Fuldenses  and  Annales Bertiniani  was  |Rorik_of_Dorestad|Rorik_Of_Dorestad|  , a  |Germanic_king|Germanic_King|  from the royal  |Scylding|Scylding|  house of  |Haithabu|Haithabu|  in the  |Jutland_Peninsula|Jutland_Peninsula| . Since the 19th century, there have been attempts to identify him with the Rurik of Russian chronicles.     Rorik of Dorestad was a member of one of two competing families reported in the  |Frank|Frankish_Empire| ish chroniclers as having ruled the nascent Danish kingdom at  |Hedeby|Hedeby| , and was likely nephew of king  |Harold_Klak|Harold_Klak| . He is mentioned as receiving lands in  |Friesland|Friesland|  from  |Emperor_Louis_I|Louis_The_Pious| . This was not enough for him, and he started to plunder neighbouring lands: he took  |Dorestad|Dorestad|  in 850, attacked Hedeby in 857, and looted  |Bremen|Bremen|  in 859, yet his own lands were ravaged in his absence. The Emperor was enraged and stripped him of all his possessions in 860. After that, Rorik disappears from the Western sources for a considerable period of time, while only two years later, in 862, the Russian chronicles Rurik arrives in the eastern Baltic, builds the fortress of Ladoga, and later moves to Novgorod.     Rorik of Dorestad reappeared in Frankish chronicles in 870, when his Friesland  |demesne|Demesne|  was returned to him by  |Charles_the_Bald|Charles_The_Bald| ; in 882 Rorik of Dorestad is mentioned as dead . The Russian chronicle places the death of Rurik of Novgorod at 879, a three year gap prior than the Frankish chronicles. According to Western sources, the ruler of Friesland was converted to Christianity by the Franks. This may have parallels with the  |Christianization_of_the_Rus|Christianization_Of_The_Rus_Khaganate| , as reported by  |Patriarch_Photius|Photios_I_Of_Constantinople|  in 867.     The idea of identifying the Rurik of Nestors chronicle with Rorik of Dorestad of the Carolingian chronicles was revived by the anti-Normanists  |Boris_Rybakov|Boris_Rybakov|  and Anatoly H. Kirpichnikov in the mid-20th century, Kirpichnikov, Anatoly H. Сказание о призвании варягов. Анализ и возможности источника . Первые скандинавские чтения, СПб; 1997; ch. 7–18. while modern scholars like  |Alexander_Nazarenko|Alexander_Nazarenko|  object to it. Nazarenko, Alexander. Rjurik и   Riis Th., Rorik , Lexikon des Mittelalters, VII; Munich, 1995; pp. 880, 1026. The hypothesis of their identity currently lacks support among scholars,  Interview with Igor Danilevsky. though support for a Normannic origin of the Rus has increased.       In  |Estonia|Estonia| n folklore there is a tale of three brothers, who were born as sons of a  |peasant|Peasant| , but through great bravery and courageousness later became all rulers in foreign countries. The brothers were called Rahurikkuja , Siniuss and Truuvaar , names given to them by their childhood friend, a blue snake. Kampmaa, Mihkel.  Sakala, no 20, 09.06.1890             The Rurik dynasty  went on to rule the  |Kievan_Rus|Kievan_Rus| , and ultimately the  |Tsardom_of_Russia|Tsardom_Of_Russia| , until 1598, and numerous noble Russian and Ruthenian families claim a male-line descent from Rurik.  |Vasily_Tatishchev|Vasily_Tatishchev|  claimed that Rurik was of  |Wend|Wends| ish extraction and went so far as to name Ruriks wife, Efanda of Norway ; mother, Umila; his maternal grandfather,  |Gostomysl|Gostomysl| ; and a cousin,  |Vadim|Vadim_Of_Novgorod|  .
