Most of the Peninsula is occupied by  |San_Mateo_County|San_Mateo_County_California| , between San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, and including the cities and towns of  |Atherton|Atherton_California| ,  |Belmont|Belmont_California| ,  |Brisbane|Brisbane_California| ,  |Burlingame|Burlingame_California| ,  |Colma|Colma_California| ,  |Daly_City|Daly_City_California| ,  |East_Palo_Alto|East_Palo_Alto_California| ,  |El_Granada|El_Granada_California| ,  |Foster_City|Foster_City_California| ,  |Hillsborough|Hillsborough_California| ,  |Half_Moon_Bay|Half_Moon_Bay_California| ,  |La_Honda|La_Honda_California| ,  |Loma_Mar|Loma_Mar_California| ,  |_Los_Altos|Los_Altos_California| ,  |Menlo_Park|Menlo_Park_California| ,  |Millbrae|Millbrae_California| ,  |Mountain_View|Mountain_View_California| ,  |Pacifica|Pacifica_California| ,  |Palo_Alto|Palo_Alto_California| ,  |Pescadero|Pescadero_California| ,  |Portola_Valley|Portola_Valley_California| ,  |Redwood_City|Redwood_City_California| ,  |San_Bruno|San_Bruno_California| ,  |San_Carlos|San_Carlos_California| ,  |San_Mateo|San_Mateo_California| ,  |South_San_Francisco|South_San_Francisco_California| ,  |Sunnyvale|Sunnyvale_California| , and  |Woodside|Woodside_California| .     Whereas the term peninsula technically refers to the entire geographical San Franciscan Peninsula, in local jargon, The Peninsula does not include the city of San Francisco.        In 1795, Governor  |Diego_de_Borica|Diego_De_Borica|  gave  |José_Darío_Argüello|José_Darío_Argüello|  a  |Spanish_land_grant|Ranchos_Of_California|  known as  |Rancho_de_las_Pulgas|Rancho_De_Las_Pulgas| .  This rancho was the largest grant on the peninsula consisting of .     As a local  |geographic|Geographic|  term, the area referred to as The Peninsula is distinct from that denoted by The City , and refers to the portion south of San Francisco. The appellation may date to the period, prior to 1856, when the City of San Francisco and the County of San Francisco were separate entities, the latter then coextensive with contemporary San Mateo County and San Francisco City-County. The City-County owns several disjunct properties along the whole of the Peninsula ; thus, most of the larger communities in San Mateo County are de facto suburbs of San Francisco, with the neighboring communities of Pacifica, Daly City, Broadmoor, Colma, South San Francisco, Half Moon Bay, San Bruno, and Brisbane being immediate suburbs. The remaining suburban area of the Peninsula is on the east side of the  |Santa_Cruz_Mountains|Santa_Cruz_Mountains| , along  |San_Francisco_Bay|San_Francisco_Bay| ; the west and south-central portions of the Peninsula are mostly rural, unincorporated and unorganised areas.     A substantial portion of  |Silicon_Valley|Silicon_Valley|  is located on the peninsula. In Silicon Valley are the headquarters of some of the largest tech companies in the world, such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Apple. Over the last decade or so there has been an influx of immigration into the Bay Area from places like India and China to work in the technology industry. There are well over 6,600 tech startups in the Valley and new ones are created every day. Price, Robert. History. Roadmap To Silicon Valley. Roadmaptosiliconvalley.org. Web. 21 May 2014.       The east side of the peninsula is a densely populated and largely urban and suburban area that includes portions of Silicon Valley. It forms a commuter area between San Francisco to the north and  |San_Jose|San_Jose_California|  to the south. A number of major thoroughfares run north-south:  |El_Camino_Real|El_Camino_Real|   and  |US_101|U_S_Route_101_In_California|  on the east side along the bay,  |Interstate_280|Interstate_280|  down the center,  |Skyline_Boulevard|Skyline_Boulevard|   along the crest of the  |Santa_Cruz_Mountains|Santa_Cruz_Mountains| , and  |SR_1|California_State_Route_1|  on the west along the Pacific, and  |SR_85|California_State_Route_85|  which forms the southern end of the Peninsula. The  |Caltrain|Caltrain|  commuter rail line runs roughly parallel to the El Camino Real and Highway 101 corridors.             |Interstate_80|Interstate_80| |_Interstate_280|Interstate_280| |_Interstate_380|Interstate_380| |_U_S_Route_101|U_S_Route_101_In_California| |_State_Route_1|California_State_Route_1| |_State_Route_9|California_State_Route_9| |_State_Route_35|California_State_Route_35| |_State_Route_82|California_State_Route_82| |_State_Route_84|California_State_Route_84| |_State_Route_85|California_State_Route_85| |_State_Route_92|California_State_Route_92| |_State_Route_109|California_State_Route_109| |_State_Route_114|California_State_Route_114| |_State_Route_237|California_State_Route_237|         The bridges in the Peninsula include the  |Dumbarton_Bridge|Dumbarton_Bridge| , the  |San_Francisco_Oakland_Bay_Bridge|San_Francisco_Oakland_Bay_Bridge| , the  |San_Mateo_Hayward_Bridge|San_Mateo_Hayward_Bridge|  and the  |Golden_Gate_Bridge|Golden_Gate_Bridge| .
