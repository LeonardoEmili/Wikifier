A rerun or repeat is a rebroadcast of an episode of a radio or television  |program|Broadcast_Programming| . There are two types of reruns â€“ those that occur during a  |hiatus|Hiatus| , and those that occur when a program is  |syndicated|Broadcast_Syndication| . Reruns can also be, as the case with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside its  |timeslot|Dayparting|  .       In the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , the word repeat refers only to a single episode; rerun or rerunning is the preferred term for an entire series/season. A repeat is a single episode of a series that is broadcast outside its original timeslot on the same channel/network. The episode is usually the repeat of the scheduled episode that was broadcast in the original timeslot earlier the previous week. It allows viewers who werent able to watch the show in its timeslot to catch up before the next episode is broadcast. The term rerun can also be used in some respects as a synonym for  reprint , the equivalent term for print items; this is especially true for print items that are part of ongoing series . In South Africa, reruns of the daily soap opera  |7de_Laan|7De_Laan| , and others, are called an Omnibus. The Omnibus is a weekly rerun that is broadcast on a Sunday afternoon on the original channel/network. It only broadcasts the past weeks episodes back to back.     When used to refer to the rebroadcast of a single episode,  |Lucille_Ball|Lucille_Ball|  and  |Desi_Arnaz|Desi_Arnaz|  are generally credited as the inventors of the rerun; it was first utilized for the American television series  I Love Lucy  during Balls pregnancy. Prior to I Love Lucy rerunning its episodes during the summer, shows typically went on a summer hiatus and were replaced with summer replacements, generally lower-priority programs; this strategy has seen increased use in the 21st century as fewer episodes have been produced each season and in-season reruns have increased.  |Rod_Serlings|Rod_Serling|  1955 teleplay  Patterns  was credited with proving reruns viability; buoyed by strong  |word_of_mouth|Word_Of_Mouth| , the rerun of Patterns drew more viewers than the first run as people who had missed the first airing a month prior tuned in to catch the re-airing. Gould, Jack. TV: Twice-Told Tale . New York Times, February 11, 1955. p. 31. ProQuest Historical Newspapers, New York Times       In the  |United_States|United_States| , most television shows from the late 1940s and early 1950s were performed live, and in many cases they were never recorded. However, television networks in the United States began making  |kinescope|Kinescope|  recordings of shows broadcast live from the  |East_Coast|East_Coast_Of_The_United_States| . This allowed the show to be broadcast later for the  |West_Coast|West_Coast_Of_The_United_States| . These kinescopes, along with pre-filmed shows, and later,  |videotape|Videotape| , paved the way for extensive reruns of syndicated television series.        In the United States, currently running shows will rerun older episodes from the same season to fill the time slot with the same program during the off-season period when no new episodes are being made. Shows will tend to start rerunning episodes after the November  |sweeps_period|Sweeps|  . and usually show only reruns from mid-December until mid-January or even February  |sweeps|Sweeps|  This winter phase is also used to try out new shows that did not make it onto the fall schedule to see how they fare with the public. These series usually run six to 13 episodes. If they do well with the public, they may get a renewal for a half or full season in the new schedule. Shows that are already popular will return from February sweeps until the end of the season with only limited reruns used.     The number of episodes per season, originally well over 30 episodes during the 1950s and 1960s, dropped below 26 in the 1970s.  |Specials|Television_Special|  typically pad out the remainder of the schedule.        Often, if a  |television_special|Television_Special|  such as  Peter Pan  or a network television broadcast of a classic film like  The Wizard of Oz  is especially well-received, it will be rerun from time to time. Before the  |VCR|Vcr|  era, this would be the only opportunity audiences had of seeing a program more than once.     Seasonal programming such as  How the Grinch Stole Christmas ,  The Ten Commandments ,  Its A Wonderful Life  or the  |Charlie_Brown_television_specials|List_Of_Peanuts_Media|  are normally re-shown each year, in  |the_appropriate_timeframe|Holiday_Season| .       A television program goes into  |syndication|Broadcast_Syndication|  when many episodes of the program are sold as a package. Generally the buyer is either a  |cable_channel|Cable_Channel|  or an owner of local television stations. Often, programs are not particularly profitable until they are sold for syndication. Since local television stations often need to sell more commercial airtime than  |network_affiliates|Network_Affiliate| , syndicated shows are usually edited to make room for extra commercials. Often about  |100_episodes|100_Episodes|  are required for a weekly series to be rerun in daily syndication . Very popular series running more than four seasons may start daily reruns of the first seasons, while production and airings continue of the current seasons episodes; until approximately the early 1980s, shows that aired in syndication while still in production had the reruns aired under an alternate name  to differentiate the reruns from the first-run episodes.     Few people anticipated the long life that a popular television series would eventually see in syndication, so most performers signed contracts that limited residual payments to about six repeats. After that, the actors received nothing and the production company would keep 100% of any income until the copyright expired; many shows did not even have their copyrights renewed and others were  |systematically_destroyed_to_recycle_valuable_film|Wiping| , such was the lack of awareness of the potential for revenue from them. This situation went unchanged until the mid-1970s, when contracts for new shows extended  |residual_payments|Residual|  for the performers, regardless of the number of reruns, while tape recycling effectively came to an end and the  |Copyright_Act_of_1976|Copyright_Act_Of_1976|  extended copyright terms to much longer lengths, eliminating the need for renewal.     Once a series is no longer performing well enough to be sold in syndication, it may still remain in barter syndication, in which television stations are offered the program for free in exchange for a requirement to air additional advertisements bundled with the free program during other shows .  |The_Program_Exchange|The_Program_Exchange|  was once the most prominent barter syndicator in United States television, offering mostly older series from numerous network libraries. Barter syndicated series may be seen on smaller, independent stations with small budgets or as short-term filler on larger stations; they tend not to be as widely syndicated as programs syndicated with a rights fee.       With the growing availability of  |cable|Cable_Television|  and  |satellite_television|Satellite_Television|  channels as well as over-the-air  |digital_subchannels|Digital_Subchannel| , combined with a growing body of available post-syndication programming, a handful of specialty channels have been built solely or primarily to run former network programming which otherwise would no longer be in syndication. Branded as classic television , these often carry reruns of programming dating back to the  |monochrome|Monochrome|  television era and are promoted as nostalgia. The corresponding  |radio_format|Radio_Format|  would be that of an  |oldies|Oldies| ,  |classic_rock|Classic_Rock| ,  |classic_hits|Classic_Hits|  or  |adult_standards|Adult_Standards|  station. Depending on the programs chosen for a classic network, running the format can be very inexpensive, due to many shows beginning to fall into the  |public_domain|Public_Domain| .     On cable and satellite, channels that devote at least some of their program schedule to post-syndication reruns include  |Nick_at_Nite|Nick_At_Nite| ,  |TV_Land|Tv_Land| ,  |TBS|Tbs| ,  |USA_Network|Usa_Network| ,  |WGN_America|Wgn_America| ,  |Pop|Pop| ,  |Discovery_Family|Discovery_Family| ,  |Game_Show_Network|Game_Show_Network| ,  |Boomerang|Boomerang| ,  |Nicktoons|Nicktoons| ,  |INSP|The_Inspiration_Network| ,  |RFD_TV|Rfd_Tv| , and the  |Hallmark_Channel|Hallmark_Channel| .  |Equity_Media_Holdings|Equity_Media_Holdingsretro_Television_Network_Stations|  had been using  |low_power_television_stations|Low_Power_Broadcasting|  to carry its own  |Retro_Television_Network|Retro_Television_Network|  in various markets; those stations were, as a result of Equity going bankrupt, sold to religious broadcaster  |Daystar_Television_Network|Daystar| . Since the early 2010s, the growth of  |digital_subchannel|Digital_Subchannel|  networks has allowed for increasing specialization of these classic networks: in addition to general-interest program networks such as  |MeTV|Metv| ,  |Logo_TV|Logo_Tv| ,  |Retro_TV|Retro_Television_Network|  and  |Antenna_TV|Antenna_Tv| , there exist networks solely for sitcoms ,  |game_shows|Game_Show|  , black-oriented programs , childrens programming , true crime and court programming , and feature films .     Traditionally, shows most likely to be rerun in this manner are  |scripted_comedies|Situation_Comedy|  and dramas. Such shows are more likely to be considered  |evergreen_content|Evergreen|  that can be rerun for a long period of time without losing its cultural relevance.  |Game_shows|Game_Show| ,  |variety_shows|Variety_Show| ,  |Saturday_morning_cartoons|Saturday_Morning_Cartoon|  and, to a lesser extent,  |newsmagazines|Newsmagazine| ,  |tabloid_talk_shows|Tabloid_Talk_Show|  and  |late_night_talk_shows|Late_Night_Talk_Show|  have been seen less commonly in reruns; game shows can quickly become dated because of  |inflation|Inflation| , while talk shows often draw humor from contemporary events. Most variants of  |reality_television|Reality_Television|  have proven to be a comparative failure in reruns, due to a number of factors ; some self-contained and personality-driven reality shows have been successfully rerun. Reruns of sports broadcasts, which face many of the same issues reality shows face, have found a  |niche|Niche_Market| , and networks such as  |MSG_Network|Msg| ,  |ESPN_Classic|Espn_Classic|  and  |NFL_Network|Nfl_Network|  currently have a significant portion of programming time devoted to reruns of live sportscasts.       With the rise of the  |DVD|Dvd|  video format,  |box_sets|Box_Set|  featuring season or series runs of  |television_series|Television_Series|  have become an increasingly important retail item. Some view this development as a rising new idea in the industry of reruns as an increasingly major revenue source in themselves instead of the standard business model as a draw for audiences for advertising. While there were  |videotape|Videotape|  releases of television series before DVD, the formats limited content capacity, large size and reliance on mechanical winding made it impractical as a widespread retail item. Many series which continue to air first-run episodes  may release DVD sets of the prior season between the end of that season and the beginning of the next.     Some television programs that are released on DVD may not have all of the seasons released, either due to poor overall sales or prohibitive costs for obtaining rights to music used in the program; one such incidence is  Perfect Strangers , which has seldom been in wide syndication since the late 1990s primarily due to lack of demand, which had only a DVD set of the first and second seasons released due to the expensiveness of relicensing songs used in later seasons of the series that are performed by the shows  |two_lead|Balki_Bartokomous| |_characters|Larry_Appleton| .  In some cases, series whose later season releases have been held up for these reasons may have the remaining seasons made available on DVD, often after a distributor that does not hold syndication rights to the program  secures the rights for future DVD releases.        TV Guide  originally used the term rerun to designate rebroadcast programs, but abruptly changed to repeat in the early 1970s.     Other TV listings services and publications, including local newspapers, would often indicate reruns as ; since the early 2000s, many listing services only provide a notation if an episode is new , with reruns getting no notation.       In the United Kingdom, most drama and comedy series run for shorter seasons â€“ typically six, seven or thirteen episodes â€“ and are then replaced by others. An exception is  |soap_operas|Soap_Opera| , which are either on all year round , or are on for a season similar to the American format.     As in the U.S., fewer new episodes are made during the summer. Until recently it was also common practice for the  |BBC|British_Broadcasting_Corporation| ,  |ITV|Itv|  and  |Channel_4|Channel_4|  to repeat classic shows from their archives, but this has more or less dried up in favor of newer formats like  |reality|Reality_Television|  shows, except on the BBC where older BBC shows, especially  |sitcoms|Situation_Comedy|  like  Dads Army  and  Fawlty Towers , are frequently repeated.     Syndication did not exist as such in United Kingdom until the arrival of  |satellite|Sky_Television_Plc| , cable and later, from 1998 on, digital television, although it could be argued that many ITV programs up to the early 1990s, particularly imported programming was syndicated in the sense that each ITV region bought some programs independently of the ITV Network, and in particular many programs out of prime time made by smaller ITV stations were part-networked where some regions would show them and others would not. Nowadays there are many channels in the UK  which repackage and rebroadcast classic programming from both sides of the  |Atlantic|Atlantic_Ocean| . Some of these channels, like their U.S. counterparts, make commercial timing cuts; others get around this by running shows in longer time slots, and critics of timing cuts see no reason why all channels should not do the same.      Early on in the history of British television, agreements with the actors union  |Equity|British_Actors_Equity_Association|  and other trade bodies limited the number of times a single program could be broadcast, usually only twice, and these showings were limited to within a set time period such as five years. This was due to the unions fear that the channels filling their schedules with repeats could put actors and other production staff out of work as fewer new shows would be made. It also had the unintentional side effect of causing many programs to be  |junked|Wiping|  after their repeat rights had expired, as they were considered to be of no further use by the broadcasters. Although these agreements changed during the 1980s and beyond, it is still expensive to repeat archive television series on British  |terrestrial_television|Terrestrial_Television| .
