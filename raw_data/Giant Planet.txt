        A giant planet is any massive  |planet|Planet| . They are usually primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials , rather than  |rock|Rock|  or other  |solid|Solid|  matter, but  |massive_solid_planets|Massive_Solid_Planet|  can also exist. There are four known giant planets in the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| |Jupiter|Jupiter| ,  |Saturn|Saturn| ,  |Uranus|Uranus|  and  |Neptune|Neptune| . Many  |extrasolar|Exoplanet|  giant planets have been identified orbiting other  |stars|Star| .     Giant planets are also sometimes called jovian planets, after Jupiter . They are also sometimes known as  |gas_giants|Gas_Giant| . However, many astronomers now apply the latter term only to Jupiter and Saturn, classifying Uranus and Neptune, which have different compositions, as  |ice_giants|Ice_Giant| .    Both names are potentially misleading: all of the giant planets consist primarily of fluids above their  |critical_points|Critical_Point| , where distinct gas and liquid phases do not exist. The principal components are  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and  |helium|Helium|  in the case of Jupiter and Saturn, and  |water|Water| ,  |ammonia|Ammonia|  and  |methane|Methane|  in the case of Uranus and Neptune.     The defining differences between a  |very_low-mass_brown_dwarf|Brown_Dwarflow-Mass_Brown_Dwarfs_Versus_High-Mass_Planets|  and a gas giant  are debated.  One school of thought is based on formation; the other, on the physics of the interior. Part of the debate concerns whether brown dwarfs must, by definition, have experienced  |nuclear_fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  at some point in their history.       The term gas giant was coined in 1952 by the science fiction writer  |James_Blish|James_Blish|  and was originally used to refer to all giant planets. Arguably it is something of a misnomer, because throughout most of the volume of these planets the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous form.  Other than the upper layers of the atmosphere and solids in the core, all matter is above the  |critical_point|Critical_Point_Pure_Substances:_Vapor–Liquid_Critical_Point| , where there is no distinction between liquids and gases. Fluid planet would be a more accurate term. Jupiter also has  |metallic_hydrogen|Metallic_Hydrogen|  near its center, but much of its volume is hydrogen, helium, and traces of other gases above their critical points. The observable atmospheres of all these planets  are quite thin compared to their radii, only extending perhaps one percent of the way to the center. Thus the observable portions are gaseous .     The rather misleading term has caught on because planetary scientists typically use rock, gas, and ice as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds commonly found as planetary constituents, irrespective of what  |phase|Phase_Of_Matter|  the matter may appear in. In the outer Solar System, hydrogen and helium are referred to as gases; water, methane, and ammonia as ices; and silicates and metals as rock. When deep planetary interiors are considered, it may not be far off to say that, by ice astronomers mean  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and  |carbon|Carbon| , by rock they mean  |silicon|Silicon| , and by gas they mean hydrogen and helium. The many ways in which Uranus and Neptune differ from Jupiter and Saturn have led some to use the term only for the planets similar to the latter two. With this terminology in mind, some astronomers have started referring to Uranus and Neptune as  |ice_giants|Ice_Giant|  to indicate the predominance of the ices in their interior composition.      The alternative term jovian planet refers to the Roman god  |Jupiter|Jupiter| —the genitive form of which is Jovis, hence Jovian—and was intended to indicate that all of these planets were similar to Jupiter.     Objects large enough to start  |deuterium|Deuterium| |fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|   are called  |brown_dwarfs|Brown_Dwarf| , and these occupy the mass range between that of large giant planets and the lowest-mass  |stars|Star| . The 13-Jupiter-mass  cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the  value is somewhere in between.  The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on the mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of  |helium|Helium|  and deuterium present. , David S. Spiegel, Adam Burrows, John A. Milsom The  |Extrasolar_Planets_Encyclopaedia|Extrasolar_Planets_Encyclopaedia|  includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, and the  |Exoplanet_Data_Explorer|Exoplanet_Data_Explorer|  up to 24 Jupiter masses.          A giant planet is a massive  |planet|Planet|  and has a thick atmosphere of  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  and  |helium|Helium| . They may have a dense molten core of rocky elements, or the core may have completely dissolved and dispersed throughout the planet if the planet is hot enough. , Hugh F. Wilson, Burkhard Militzer, 2011 In traditional giant planets such as  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  and  |Saturn|Saturn|  hydrogen and helium constitute most of the mass of the planet, whereas they only make up an outer envelope on  |Uranus|Uranus|  and  |Neptune|Neptune| , which are instead mostly composed of  |water|Water| ,  |ammonia|Ammonia| , and  |methane|Methane|  and therefore increasingly referred to as  |ice_giants|Ice_Giant|  .     Extrasolar giant planets that orbit very close to their stars are the  |exoplanets|Exoplanet|  that are easiest to detect. These are called  |hot_Jupiters|Hot_Jupiter|  and  |hot_Neptunes|Hot_Neptune|  because they have very high surface temperatures. Hot Jupiters were, until the advent of space-borne telescopes, the most common form of exoplanet known, due to the relative ease of detecting them with ground-based instruments.     Giant planets are commonly said to lack solid surfaces, but it is more accurate to say that they lack surfaces altogether since the gases that constitute them simply become thinner and thinner with increasing distance from the planets centers, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the interplanetary medium. Therefore, landing on a giant planet may or may not be possible, depending on the size and composition of its core.                 Gas giants consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The Solar Systems gas giants,  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  and  |Saturn|Saturn| , have heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of their mass. The Interior of Jupiter, Guillot et al., in Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere, Bagenal et al., editors, Cambridge University Press, 2004 Gas giants are thought to consist of an outer layer of  |molecular_hydrogen|Molecular_Hydrogen| , surrounding a layer of liquid  |metallic_hydrogen|Metallic_Hydrogen| , with a probable molten core with a rocky composition.     Jupiter and Saturns outermost portion of the hydrogen atmosphere has many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia. The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet, and is referred to as metallic because the very high pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor. The core is thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures and pressures that their properties are poorly understood.            Ice giants have distinctly different interior compositions from gas giants. The Solar Systems ice giants,  |Uranus|Uranus|  and  |Neptune|Neptune| , have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that extends from the cloud tops down to about 80% or 85% of their radius. Below this, they are predominantly icy , i.e. consist mostly of water, methane, and ammonia. There is also some rock and gas, but various proportions of ice–rock–gas could mimic pure ice, so that the exact proportions are unknown.      Uranus and Neptune have very hazy atmospheric layers with small amounts of methane, giving them aquamarine colors; light blue and ultramarine respectively. Both have magnetic fields that are sharply inclined to their axes of rotation.     Unlike the other giant planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt that causes its seasons to be severely pronounced. The two planets also have other subtle but important differences. Uranus has more hydrogen and helium than Neptune despite being less massive overall. Neptune is therefore denser and has much more internal heat and a more active atmosphere. The  |Nice_model|Nice_Model| , in fact, suggests that Neptune formed closer to the  |Sun|Sun|  than Uranus did, and should therefore have more heavy elements.          |Massive_solid_planets|Exoplanetmassive_Solid_Planets|  can also exist. For example,  |Kepler-10c|Kepler-10C|  is composed of mostly of rock with possibly up to 20% high-pressure water ice, but does have a hydrogen-dominated envelope.     Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars , where the  |protoplanetary_disk|Protoplanetary_Disk|  would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high  |UV_radiation|Uv_Radiation|  and  |winds|Stellar_Wind|  that could  |photoevaporate|Photoevaporation|  the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.    For comparison, Neptunes mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the  |IAUs|Iau|  working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.                Because of the limited  |techniques_currently_available|Methods_Of_Detecting_Exoplanets|  to detect  |exoplanets|Exoplanet| , many of those found to date have been of a size associated, in the Solar System, with giant planets. Because these large planets are inferred to share more in common with Jupiter than with the other giant planets, some have claimed that jovian planet is a more accurate term for them. Many of the exoplanets are much closer to their parent stars and hence much hotter than the giant planets in the Solar System, making it possible that some of those planets are a type not observed in the Solar System. Considering the relative  |abundances_of_the_elements_in_the_universe|Abundance_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  it would be surprising to find a predominantly rocky planet more massive than Jupiter. On the other hand, models of planetary-system formation have suggested that giant planets would be inhibited from forming as close to their stars as many of the extrasolar giant planets have been observed to orbit.       The bands seen in the  |atmosphere_of_Jupiter|Atmosphere_Of_Jupiter|  are due to counter-circulating streams of material called zones and belts, encircling the planet parallel to its equator. The zones are the lighter bands, and are at higher altitudes in the atmosphere. They have an internal updraft and are high-pressure regions. The belts are the darker bands, are lower in the atmosphere, and have an internal downdraft. They are low-pressure regions. These structures are somewhat analogous to the high and low-pressure cells in Earths atmosphere, but they have a very different structure—latitudinal bands that circle the entire planet, as opposed to small confined cells of pressure. This appears to be a result of the rapid rotation and underlying symmetry of the planet. There are no oceans or landmasses to cause local heating and the rotation speed is much higher than that of Earth.     There are smaller structures as well: spots of different sizes and colors. On Jupiter, the most noticeable of these features is the  |Great_Red_Spot|Great_Red_Spot|.
