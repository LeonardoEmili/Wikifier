      Leo  is one of the  |constellations|Constellation|  of the  |zodiac|Zodiac| , lying between  |Cancer|Cancer|  the crab to the west and  |Virgo|Virgo|  the maiden to the east. Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for  |lion|Lion| , and to the  |ancient_Greeks|Ancient_Greeks|  represented the  |Nemean_Lion|Nemean_Lion|  killed by the mythical Greek hero  |Heracles|Heracles|  meaning Glory of Hera  as one of his  |twelve_labors.|Twelve_Labours|  Its symbol is  |20px|Image:Leo.Svg|  . One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd-century astronomer  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy| , Leo remains one of the 88 modern constellations today, and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouching lion it depicts. The lions mane and shoulders also form an  |asterism|Asterism|  known as The Sickle, which to modern observers may resemble a backwards question mark.                 Leo contains many bright stars, many of which were individually identified by the ancients. There are four stars of first or second magnitude, which render this constellation especially prominent:    |Regulus|Regulus| , designated  |Alpha_Leonis|Alpha_Leonis| , is a blue-white  |main-sequence|Main-Sequence|  star of magnitude 1.34, 77.5 light-years from Earth. It is a  |double_star|Double_Star|  divisible in binoculars, with a secondary of magnitude 7.7. Its traditional name means the little king .    |Beta_Leonis|Beta_Leonis| , called Denebola, is at the opposite end of the constellation to Regulus. It is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.23, 36 light-years from Earth. The name Denebola means the lions tail .   Algieba,  |Gamma_Leonis|Gamma_Leonis| , is a  |binary_star|Binary_Star|  with a third optical component; the primary and secondary are divisible in small telescopes and the tertiary is visible in binoculars. The primary is a gold-yellow  |giant_star|Giant_Star|  of magnitude 2.61 and the secondary is similar but at magnitude 3.6; they have a period of 600 years and are 126 light-years from Earth. The unrelated tertiary,  |40_Leonis|40_Leonis| , is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 4.8. Its traditional name, Algieba, means the forehead .    |Delta_Leonis|Delta_Leonis| , called Zosma, is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.58, 58 light-years from Earth.    |Epsilon_Leonis|Epsilon_Leonis|  is a  |yellow_giant|Yellow_Giant|  of magnitude 3.0, 251 light-years from Earth.  |Zeta_Leonis|Zeta_Leonis| , called Adhafera, is an optical triple star. The brightest and only star designated Zeta Leonis, is a  |white_giant|White_Giant|  star of magnitude 3.65, 260 light-years from Earth. The second-brightest,  |39_Leonis|39_Leonis| , is widely spaced to the south and of magnitude 5.8.  |35_Leonis|35_Leonis|  is to the north and of magnitude 6.0.    |Iota_Leonis|Iota_Leonis|  is a  |binary_star|Binary_Star|  divisible in medium amateur telescopes; they are divisible in small amateur telescopes at their widest in the years 2053–2063. To the unaided eye, Iota Leonis appears to be a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 4.0. The system, 79 light-years from Earth, has components of magnitude 4.1 and 6.7 with a period of 183 years.    |Tau_Leonis|Tau_Leonis|  is a double star visible in binoculars. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 5.0, 621 light-years from Earth. The secondary is a star of magnitude 8.  |54_Leonis|54_Leonis|  is a binary star 289 light-years from Earth, divisible in small telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.5 and the secondary is a blue-white star of magnitude 6.3.     The other named stars in Leo are  |Mu_Leonis|Mu_Leonis| , Rasalas ; and  |Theta_Leonis|Theta_Leonis| , Chertan or Coxa .      Leo is also home to one bright  |variable_star|Variable_Star| , the  |red_giant|Red_Giant| |R_Leonis|R_Leonis| . It is a  |Mira_variable|Mira_Variable|  with a minimum magnitude of 10 and normal maximum magnitude of 6; it periodically brightens to magnitude 4.4. R Leonis, 330 light-years from Earth, has a period of 310 days and a diameter of 450  |solar_diameters|Solar_Diameter| .     The star  |Wolf_359|Wolf_359|  , one of the  |nearest_stars|List_Of_Nearest_Stars|  to Earth at 7.8  |light-years|Light-Year|  away, is in Leo. Wolf 359 is a  |red_dwarf|Red_Dwarf|  of magnitude 13.5; it periodically brightens by one magnitude or less because it is a  |flare_star|Flare_Star| .  |Gliese_436|Gliese_436| , a faint star in Leo about 33 light-years away from the Sun, is orbited by a transiting Neptune-mass  |extrasolar_planet|Extrasolar_Planet| .      The  |carbon_star|Carbon_Star|  CW Leo  is the brightest star in the night sky at the infrared N-band .     The star  |SDSS_J102915+172927|Sdss_J102915+172927|  is a population II star in the  |galactic_halo|Galactic_Halo|  seen in Leo. It is about 13 billion years old, making it one of the oldest stars in the Galaxy. It has the lowest  |metallicity|Metallicity|  of any known star.     Modern astronomers, including  |Tycho_Brahe|Tycho_Brahe|  in 1602, excised a group of stars that once made up the tuft of the lions tail and used them to form the new constellation  |Coma_Berenices|Coma_Berenices|  , although there was precedent for that designation among the ancient Greeks and Romans. L. Phil Simpson Guidebook to the Constellations: Telescopic Sights, Tales, and Myths, p. 235 .       Leo contains many bright  |galaxies|Galaxy| ;  |Messier_65|Messier_65| ,  |Messier_66|Messier_66| ,  |Messier_95|Messier_95| ,  |Messier_96|Messier_96| ,  |Messier_105|Messier_105| , and  |NGC_3628|Ngc_3628|  are the most famous, the first two being part of the  |Leo_Triplet|Leo_Triplet| .     The  |Leo_Ring|Leo_Ring| , a cloud of hydrogen, helium gas, is found in orbit of two galaxies found within this constellation.M66 is a spiral galaxy that is part of the Leo Triplet, whose other two members are M65 and NGC 3628. It is at a distance of 37 million light-years and has a somewhat distorted shape due to gravitational interactions with the other members of the Triplet, which are pulling stars away from M66. Eventually, the outermost stars may form a dwarf galaxy orbiting M66.  Both M65 and M66 are visible in large binoculars or small telescopes, but their concentrated nuclei and elongation are only visible in large amateur instruments.        M95 and M96 are both  |spiral_galaxies|Spiral_Galaxies|  20 million light-years from Earth. Though they are visible as fuzzy objects in small telescopes, their structure is only visible in larger instruments. M95 is a  |barred_spiral_galaxy|Barred_Spiral_Galaxy| . M105 is about a degree away from the M95/M96 pair; it is an  |elliptical_galaxy|Elliptical_Galaxy|  of the 9th magnitude, also about 20 million light-years from Earth.      |NGC_2903|Ngc_2903|  is a  |barred_spiral_galaxy|Barred_Spiral_Galaxy|  discovered by  |William_Herschel|William_Herschel|  in 1784. It is very similar in size and shape to the Milky Way and is located 25 million light-years from Earth. In its core, NGC 2903 has many hotspots , which have been found to be near regions of  |star_formation|Star_Formation| . The star formation in this region is thought to be due to the presence of the dusty bar, which sends shock waves through its rotation to an area with a diameter of 2,000 light-years. The outskirts of the galaxy have many young  |open_clusters|Open_Cluster| .     Leo is also home to some of the largest structures in the observable universe. Some of the structures found in the constellation are the  |Clowes–Campusano_LQG|Clowes–Campusano_Lqg| ,  |U1.11|U1.11| ,  |U1.54|U1.54| , and the  |Huge-LQG|Huge-Lqg| , which are all  |large_quasar_groups|Large_Quasar_Group| ; the latter being the second largest structure known  .       The  |Leonids|Leonids|  occur in November, peaking on November 14–15, and have a  |radiant|Radiant|  close to  |Gamma_Leonis|Gamma_Leonis| . Its parent body is  |Comet_Tempel-Tuttle|Comet_Tempel-Tuttle| , which causes significant outbursts every 35 years. The normal peak rate is approximately 10 meteors per hour.     The  |January_Leonids|January_Leonids|  are a minor shower that peaks between January 1 and 7.           Leo was one of the earliest recognized constellations, with archaeological evidence that the Mesopotamians had a similar constellation as early as 4000 BCE. The Persians called Leo Ser or Shir; the Turks, Artan; the Syrians, Aryo; the Jews, Arye; the Indians, Simha, all meaning lion .      Some mythologists believe that in Sumeria, Leo represented the monster  |Humbaba|Humbaba| , who was killed by  |Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh| . Tamra Andrews Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky .     In Babylonian astronomy, the constellation was called UR.GU.LA, the Great Lion ; the bright star  |Regulus|Regulus|  was known as the star that stands at the Lions breast. Regulus also had distinctly regal associations, as it was known as the King Star. Babylonian Star-lore by Gavin White, Solaria Publications, 2008 page 140,      In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Leo was identified as the  |Nemean_Lion|Nemean_Lion|  which was killed by  |Heracles|Heracles|  during the first of his  |twelve_labours|Labours_Of_Hercules| .   The Nemean Lion would take women as hostages to its lair in a cave, luring warriors from nearby towns to save the damsel in distress, to their misfortune.  The Lion was impervious to any weaponry; thus, the warriors clubs, swords, and spears were rendered useless against it. Realizing that he must defeat the Lion with his bare hands, Hercules slipped into the Lions cave and engaged it at close quarters. When the Lion pounced, Hercules caught it in midair, one hand grasping the Lions forelegs and the other its hind legs, and bent it backwards, breaking its back and freeing the trapped maidens. Zeus commemorated this labor by placing the Lion in the sky.     The Roman poet  |Ovid|Ovid|  called it Herculeus Leo and Violentus Leo. Bacchi Sidus  was another of its titles, the god  |Bacchus|Dionysus|  always being identified with this animal. However,  |Manilius|Marcus_Manilius|  called it Jovis et Junonis Sidus .          , the Sun appears in the constellation Leo from August 10 to September 10. In  |tropical_astrology|Tropical_Astrology| , the Sun is considered to be in the sign  |Leo|Leo|  from July 23 to August 22, and in  |sidereal_astrology|Sidereal_Astrology| , from August 16 to September 17.            Leo is commonly represented as if the sickle-shaped  |asterism|Asterism|  of stars is the back of the Lions head. The sickle is marked by six stars:  |Epsilon_Leonis|Epsilon_Leonis| ,  |Mu_Leonis|Mu_Leonis| ,  |Zeta_Leonis|Zeta_Leonis| ,  |Gamma_Leonis|Gamma_Leonis| ,  |Eta_Leonis|Eta_Leonis| , and  |Alpha_Leonis|Regulus| . The lions tail is marked by  |Beta_Leonis|Beta_Leonis|  and the rest of his body is delineated by  |Delta_Leonis|Delta_Leonis|  and  |Theta_Leonis|Theta_Leonis| .           |H.A._Rey|H.A._Rey|  has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars, which graphically shows a  |lion|Lion|  walking. The stars  |delta_Leonis|Delta_Leonis| ,  |gamma_Leonis|Gamma_Leonis| ,  |eta_Leonis|Eta_Leonis| , and  |theta_Leonis|Theta_Leonis|  form the body of the lion, with gamma Leonis being of the second magnitude and delta Leonis and theta Leonis being of the third magnitude. The stars gamma Leonis,  |zeta_Leonis|Zeta_Leonis| ,  |mu_Leonis|Mu_Leonis| ,  |epsilon_Leonis|Epsilon_Leonis| , and  |eta_Leonis|Eta_Leonis|  form the lions  |neck|Neck| , with epsilon Leonis being of the third magnitude. The stars mu Leonis,  |kappa_Leonis|Kappa_Leonis| ,  |lambda_Leonis|Lambda_Leonis| , and epsilon Leonis form the  |head|Head|  of the lion. Delta Leonis and  |beta_Leonis|Beta_Leonis|  form the lions  |tail|Tail| |Denebola|Denebola| , is the bright tip of the tail with a magnitude of two. The stars  |theta_Leonis|Theta_Leonis| ,  |iota_Leonis|Iota_Leonis| , and  |sigma_Leonis|Sigma_Leonis|  form the left hind  |leg|Leg|  of the lion, with sigma Leonis being the foot. The stars theta Leonis and  |rho_Leonis|Rho_Leonis|  form the right hind leg, with rho Leonis being the foot. The stars  |eta_Leonis|Eta_Leonis|  and  |Alpha_Leonis|Alpha_Leonis|  mark the lions heart, with alpha Leonis, also known as  |Regulus|Regulus| , being the bright star of magnitude one. The stars eta Leonis and  |omicron_Leonis|Omicron_Leonis|  form the right front foot of the Lion. H. A. Rey, The Stars   A New Way To See Them. Enlarged World-Wide Edition.
