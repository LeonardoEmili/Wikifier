In fact, every compact orientable surface is realizable as a Riemann surface. Thus compact Riemann surfaces are characterized topologically by their genus: 0, 1, 2, .... On the other hand, the genus does not characterize the complex structure. For example, there are uncountably many non-isomorphic compact Riemann surfaces of genus 1 .       Non-compact surfaces are more difficult to classify. As a simple example, a non-compact surface can be obtained by puncturing a closed manifold. On the other hand, any open subset of a compact surface is itself a non-compact surface; consider, for example, the complement of a ": null

In general the topological type of M is determined by the four subspaces of E that are limit points of infinitely many handles and infinitely many projective planes, limit points of only handles, and limit points of neither  .
