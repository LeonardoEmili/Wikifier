The history of science and technology  is a field of  |history|History|  which examines how understanding of the natural world and ability to manipulate it  have changed over the centuries. This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.      |Histories_of_science|Historiography_Of_Science|  were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with  |William_Whewell|William_Whewell| , as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  historian  |Boris_Hessen|Boris_Hessen| , was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After  |World_War_II|World_War_&_Nbsp;Ii| , extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by  |Thomas_Kuhn|Thomas_Kuhn| , the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise.     Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the  |Scientific_Revolution|Scientific_Revolution| , though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the  |Greeks|Ancient_Greece| ,  |Egyptians|Ancient_Egypt| ,  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| ns,  |Chinese|History_Of_Science_And_Technology_In_China| ,  |Indians|Science_And_Technology_In_Ancient_India| .

Academic study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by  |George_Sarton|George_Sarton|  at Harvard with his book Introduction to the History of Science and the  |Isis_journal|Isis|  . Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.
