Starting in the 1960s, a general consensus emerged among biblical scholars that Philippians was not written as one unified letter, but is rather a compilation of fragments from three separate letters from Paul to the church in Philippi.  According to Philip Sellew, Philippians contains the following letter fragments:   Letter A consists of Philippians 4:10-20. It is a short thank-you note from Paul to the Philippian church, regarding gifts they had sent him. Letter B consists of Philippians 1:1-3:1, and may also include 4:4-9 and 4:21-23.   Letter C consists of Philippians 3:2-4:1, and may also include 4:2-3. It is a testament to Pauls rejection of all worldly things for the sake of the gospel of Jesus.    In support of the idea that Philippians is a composite work, scholars point to the abrupt shifts in tone and topic within the text.

Nevertheless, a number of scholars continue to argue for the unity of Philippians.

Paul assures the Philippians that his imprisonment is actually helping to spread the Christian message, rather than hindering it. He also expresses gratitude for the devotion and heroism of Epaphroditus, who the Philippian church had sent to visit Paul and bring him gifts. Some time during his visit with Paul, Epaphroditus apparently contracted some life-threatening debilitating illness. But he recovers before being sent back to the Philippians.

In Chapter 4, Paul urges the Philippians to resolve conflicts within their fellowship. In the latter part of the chapter , Paul expresses his gratitude for the gifts that the Philippians had sent him, and assures them that God will reward them for their generosity.     Throughout the epistle there is a sense of optimism. Paul is hopeful that he will be released, and on this basis he promises to send Timothy to the Philippians for ministry, and expects to also pay them a personal visit.       Chapter 2 of the epistle contains a famous poem describing the nature of Christ and his act of redemption:      Due to its unique poetic style, scholars agree that this passage constitutes an early Christian poem that was composed by someone else prior to Pauls writings, as early as the 40s AD. While the passage is often called a hymn, some scholars believe this to be an inappropriate name since it does not have a rhythmic or metrical structure in the original Greek.       The Christ poem is significant because it strongly suggests that there were very early Christians who understood Jesus to be a pre-existent celestial being, who chose to take on human form, rather than a human who was later exalted to a divine status.      Importantly, while the author of the poem did believe that Jesus existed in heaven before his physical incarnation, this does not necessarily mean that he was believed to be equal to ": null

If harpagmon is rendered as something to be exploited, as it is in many Christian Bible translations, then the implication is that Christ was already equal to God prior to his incarnation. But Bart Ehrman and others have argued that the correct translation is in fact something to be grasped after, implying that Jesus was not equal to God before his resurrection. Outside of this passage, harpagmon and related words were almost always used to refer to something that a person doesnt yet possess but tries to acquire.     It is widely agreed by interpreters, however, that the Christ poem depicts Jesus as equal to God after his resurrection.
