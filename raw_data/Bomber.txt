           A bomber is a  |combat_aircraft|Combat_Aircraft|  designed to attack ground and naval targets by dropping  |air_to_ground_weaponry|Air_To_Ground_Weaponry|  , firing  |torpedoes|Aerial_Torpedo|  and bullets, or deploying  |air_launched_cruise_missiles|Air_Launched_Cruise_Missile| .                  |Strategic_bombing|Strategic_Bombing|  is done by  |heavy_bombers|Heavy_Bomber|  primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against  |strategic_targets|Strategic_Target|  such as supply bases, bridges, factories, shipyards, and cities themselves, to diminish the enemys ability to wage war by limiting access to resources through crippling infrastructure or reducing industrial output. Current examples include the strategic  |nuclear_armed|Nuclear_Bomb|  bombers:  |B_2_Spirit|B_2_Spirit| ,  |B_52_Stratofortress|B_52_Stratofortress| ,  |Tupolev_Tu_95|Tupolev_Tu_95|  Bear, and  |Tupolev_Tu_22M|Tupolev_Tu_22M|  Backfire; historically notable examples are the:  |Gotha_G_IV|Gotha_G_Iv| ,  |Avro_Lancaster|Avro_Lancaster| ,  |Heinkel_He_111|Heinkel_He_111| ,  |Junkers_Ju_88|Junkers_Ju_88| ,  |Boeing_B_17_Flying_Fortress|Boeing_B_17_Flying_Fortress| ,  |Consolidated_B_24_Liberator|Consolidated_B_24_Liberator| ,  |Boeing_B_29_Superfortress|Boeing_B_29_Superfortress| , and  |Tupolev_Tu_16|Tupolev_Tu_16|  Badger.           |Tactical_bombing|Tactical_Bombing| , aimed at countering enemy military activity and in supporting offensive operations, is typically assigned to smaller aircraft operating at shorter ranges, typically near the troops on the ground or against enemy shipping. This role is filled by tactical bomber class, which crosses and blurs with various other aircraft categories:  |light_bombers|Light_Bomber| ,  |medium_bombers|Medium_Bomber| ,  |dive_bombers|Dive_Bomber| ,  |interdictors|Interdictor| ,  |fighter_bombers|Fighter_Bomber| ,  |attack_aircraft|Attack_Aircraft| ,  |multirole_combat_aircraft|Multirole_Combat_Aircraft| , and others.     Current examples:  |Xian_JH_7|Xian_Jh_7| , Dassault-Breguet  |Mirage_2000D|Dassault_Mirage_2000N_2000D| , and the  |Panavia_Tornado_IDS|Panavia_Tornado| |_Ilyushin_Il_2|Ilyushin_Il_2|  Shturmovik,  |Junkers_Ju_87|Junkers_Ju_87|  Stuka,  |Republic_P_47_Thunderbolt|Republic_P_47_Thunderbolt| ,  |Hawker_Typhoon|Hawker_Typhoon|  and  |Mikoyan_MiG_27|Mikoyan_Mig_27| .       The first use of an air-dropped bomb was carried out by Italian Second Lieutenant  |Giulio_Gavotti|Giulio_Gavotti|   on 1 November 1911 during the  |Italo_Turkish_war_in_Libya|Italo_Turkish_War| . although his plane was not designed for the task of bombing, and his improvised attack on Ottoman positions at Ainzzarra had little impact. These picric acid-filled steel spheres were nicknamed ballerinas from the fluttering fabric ribbons attached.           In 1912, during the  |First_Balkan_War|First_Balkan_War| ,  |Bulgarian_Air_Force|Bulgarian_Air_Force| |_pilot|Aviator| |_Christo_Toprakchiev|Christo_Toprakchiev|  suggested the use of aircraft to drop bombs  on Turkish positions.  |Captain|Captain| |_Simeon_Petrov|Simeon_Petrov|  developed the idea and created several  |prototypes|Prototype|  by adapting different types of grenades and increasing their payload.      On 16 October 1912, observer  |Prodan_Tarakchiev|Prodan_Tarakchiev|  dropped two of those bombs on the  |Turkish|Turkey|  railway station of Karağaç  from an  |Albatros|Albatros_Flugzeugwerke|  F.2 aircraft piloted by  |Radul_Milkov|Radul_Milkov| , for the first time in this campaign.  This is deemed to be the first use of an aircraft as a bomber. I.Borislavov, R.Kirilov: The Bulgarian Aircraft, Vol.I: From Bleriot to Messerschmitt. Litera Prima, Sofia, 1996        The first heavier-than-air aircraft purposely designed for bombing were the  |Italian|Italy| |_Caproni_Ca_30|Caproni_Ca_30|  and  |British|United_Kingdom| |_Bristol_T_B_8|Bristol_T_B_8| , both of 1913.  The Bristol T.B.8 was an early  |British|United_Kingdom|  single  |engined|Piston_Engine| |_biplane|Biplane|  built by the  |Bristol_Aeroplane_Company|Bristol_Aeroplane_Company| . They were fitted with a prismatic  |Bombsight|Bombsight|  in the front  |cockpit|Cockpit|  and a cylindrical bomb carrier in the lower forward fuselage capable of carrying twelve 10  lb bombs, which could be dropped singly or as a salvo as required.      The aircraft was purchased for use both by the  |Royal_Naval_Air_Service|Royal_Naval_Air_Service|  and the  |Royal_Flying_Corps|Royal_Flying_Corps|  , and three T.B.8s, that were being displayed in  |Paris|Paris|  during December 1913 fitted with bombing equipment, were sent to France following the outbreak of war. Under the command of  |Charles_Rumney_Samson|Charles_Rumney_Samson| , a bombing attack on  |German|Germany|  gun batteries at  |Middelkerke|Middelkerke| ,  |Belgium|Belgium|  was executed on 25 November 1914.       The dirigible, or airship, was developed in the early 20th century. Early airships were prone to disaster, but slowly the airship became more dependable, with a more rigid structure and stronger skin. Prior to the outbreak of war,  |Zeppelins|Zeppelin| , a larger and more streamlined form of  |airship|Airship|  designed by German Count  |Ferdinand_von_Zeppelin|Ferdinand_Von_Zeppelin| , were outfitted to carry bombs to attack targets at long range. These were the first long range, strategic bombers. Although the German air arm was strong, with a total of 123 airships by the end of the war, they were vulnerable to attack and engine failure, as well as navigational issues. German airships inflicted little damage on all 51 raids, with 557 Britons killed and 1,358 injured. The German Navy lost 53 of its 73 airships, and the German Army lost 26 of its 50 ships.           The Caproni Ca 30 was built by  |Gianni_Caproni|Gianni_Caproni|  in  |Italy|Italy| . It was a twin-boom  |biplane|Biplane|  with three 67  kW  |Gnome_rotary_engines|Gnome_Rotary_Engine|  and first flew in October  |1914|1914_In_Aviation| . Test flights revealed power to be insufficient and the engine layout unworkable, and Caproni soon adopted a more conventional approach installing three 81  kW  |Fiat_A_10s|Fiat_A_10| . The improved design was bought by the  |Italian_Army|Italian_Army|  and it was delivered in quantity from August  |1915|1915_In_Aviation| .     While mainly used as a  |trainer|Trainer| , Avro 504s were also briefly used as bombers at the start of the  |First_World_War|World_War_I|  by the  |Royal_Naval_Air_Service|Royal_Naval_Air_Service|  when they were used for raids on the German airship sheds. Mason, Francis K. The British Bomber since 1914. London: Putnam Aeronautical Books, 1994. . p.21               Bombing raids and interdiction operations were mainly carried out by French and British forces during the War as the  |German_air_arm|Luftstreitkräfte|  was forced to concentrate its resources on a defensive strategy. Notably, bombing campaigns formed a part of the British offensive at the  |Battle_of_Neuve_Chapelle|Battle_Of_Neuve_Chapelle|  in 1915, with  |Royal_Flying_Corps|Royal_Flying_Corps|  squadrons attacking German railway   stations in an attempt to hinder the logistical supply of the  |German_army|German_Army| . The early, improvised attempts at bombing that characterized the early part of the war slowly gave way to a more organized and systematic approach to strategic and tactical bombing, pioneered by various air power strategists of the  |Entente|Allies_Of_World_War_I| , especially Major  |Hugh_Trenchard|Hugh_Trenchard| ; he was the first to advocate that there should be ... sustained attacks with a view to interrupting the enemys railway communications ... in conjunction with the main operations of the Allied Armies.     When the war started, bombing was very crude yet by the end of the war long-range bombers equipped with complex mechanical bombing computers were being built,   designed to carry large loads to destroy enemy industrial targets. The most important bombers used in World War I were the French  |Breguet_14|Breguet_14| , British  |de_Havilland_DH_4|De_Havilland_Dh_4| , German  |Albatros_C_III|Albatros_C_Iii|  and Russian    |Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets|Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets| . The  |Russian|Russian_Empire| |_Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets|Sikorsky_Ilya_Muromets| , was the first four-engine bomber to equip a dedicated strategic bombing unit during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . This heavy bomber was unrivaled in the early stages of the war, as the Central Powers had no comparable aircraft until much later.     Long range bombing raids were carried out at night by multi-engine  |biplanes|Biplane|  such as the  |Gotha_G_IV|Gotha_G_Iv|  and later the  |Handley_Page_Type_O|Handley_Page_Type_O| ; the majority of bombing was done by single-engined biplanes with one or two crew members flying short distances to attack enemy lines and immediate hinterland. As the effectiveness of a bomber was dependent on the weight and accuracy of its bomb load, ever larger bombers were developed starting in World War I, while considerable money was spent developing suitable bombsights.               With engine power as a major limitation, combined with the desire for accuracy and other operational factors, bomber designs tended to be tailored to specific roles. By the start of the war this included:      |dive_bomber|Dive_Bomber|  — specially strengthened for vertical diving attacks for greater accuracy.  |light_bomber|Light_Bomber| ,  |medium_bomber|Medium_Bomber|  and  |heavy_bomber|Heavy_Bomber|  — subjective definitions based on size.  |torpedo_bomber|Torpedo_Bomber|  — specialized aircraft armed with torpedoes.  |ground_attack_aircraft|Ground_Attack_Aircraft|  — aircraft used against targets on a battlefield such as troop or tank concentrations.   night bomber — specially equipped to operate at night when opposing defences are limited.   maritime patrol — long range bombers that were used against enemy shipping, particularly submarines.     Bombers are not intended to attack other aircraft although most were fitted with defensive weapons. World War II saw the beginning of the widespread use of high speed bombers which dispensed with defensive weapons to be able to attain higher speed, such as with the  |de_Havilland_Mosquito|De_Havilland_Mosquito| , a philosophy that continued with many Cold War bombers.     Some smaller designs have been used as the basis for  |night_fighters|Night_Fighter| , and a number of fighters, such as the  |Hawker_Hurricane|Hawker_Hurricane|  were used as ground attack aircraft, replacing earlier conventional light bombers that proved unable to defend themselves while carrying a useful bomb load.            At the start of the Cold War, bombers were the only means of carrying  |nuclear|Nuclear_Warfare|  weapons to enemy targets, and had the role of  |deterrence|Deterrence_Theory| . With the advent of guided air-to-air missiles, bombers needed to avoid interception. High-speed and high-altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. Designs such as the  |English_Electric_Canberra|English_Electric_Canberra|  could fly faster or higher than contemporary fighters. When surface-to-air missiles became capable of hitting high-flying bombers, bombers were flown at low altitudes to evade radar detection and interception.     Once stand off nuclear weapon designs were developed, bombers did not need to pass over the target to make an attack; they could fire and turn away to escape the blast. Nuclear strike aircraft were generally finished in bare metal or  |anti_flash_white|Anti_Flash_White|  to minimize absorption of  |thermal_radiation|Thermal_Radiation|  from the  |flash|Effects_Of_Nuclear_Explosions|  of a  |nuclear_explosion|Nuclear_Explosion| . The need to drop conventional bombs remained in conflicts with non-nuclear powers, such as the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  or  |Malayan_Emergency|Malayan_Emergency| .          The development of large strategic bombers stagnated in the later part of the Cold War because of spiraling costs and the development of the  |Intercontinental_ballistic_missile|Intercontinental_Ballistic_Missile|  – which was felt to have similar deterrent value while being impossible to intercept. Because of this, the United States Air Force  |XB_70_Valkyrie|Xb_70_Valkyrie|  program was cancelled in the early 1960s; the later  |B_1B_Lancer|B_1_Lancer|  and  |B_2_Spirit|B_2_Spirit|  aircraft entered service only after protracted political and development problems. Their high cost meant that few were built and the 1950s-designed B-52s are projected to remain in use until the 2040s. Similarly, the Soviet Union used the intermediate-range  |Tu_22M|Tupolev_Tu_22M|  Backfire in the 1970s, but their  |Mach_3|Mach_Number|  bomber project stalled. The Mach 2  |Tu_160_Blackjack|Tu_160|  was built only in tiny numbers, leaving the 1950s Tupolev Tu-16 and  |Tu_95|Tupolev_Tu_95|  Bear heavy bombers to continue being used into the 21st century.        The  |British|United_Kingdom|  strategic bombing force largely came to an end when the  |V_bomber|V_Bomber|  force was phased out; the last of which left service in 1983. The French  |Mirage_IV|Mirage_Iv|  bomber version was retired in 1996, although the Mirage 2000N and the Rafale have taken on this role. The only other nation that fields strategic bombing forces is  |China|China| , which has a number of  |Xian_H_6s|Xian_H_6| .            At present, the U.S. and Russia are involved in developing replacements for their legacy bomber fleets, the USAF with the  |Northrop_Grumman_B_21|Northrop_Grumman_B_21|  and the Russian Air Force with the  |PAK_DA|Pak_Da| . A 1999 USAF report calls for the US bomber fleet to remain in service until the late 2030s-early 2040s, and the B-21 is scheduled to reach deployment in the 2020s. Tirpak, John A.  . Air Force Magazine, June 1999. Retrieved December 30, 2015   The U.S. is also considering another  |bomber_in_2037|2037_Bomber| . The B-21, however, required to provide an answer to the fifth generation defense systems . Also, it has been chosen to be able to stand against rising superpowers and other countries with semi-advanced military capability. Finally, a third reason is the role of long-term air support for areas with a low threat level , the latter referred to as close air support for the global  |war_on_terror|War_On_Terror|  . The B-21 would thus be able to stay for extended periods on a same location .        Occasionally, military aircraft have been used to bomb  |ice_jams|Ice_Jam|  with limited success as part of an effort to clear them.
