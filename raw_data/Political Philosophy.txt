         Political philosophy, also known as political theory, is the study of topics such as  |politics|Politics| ,  |liberty|Liberty| ,  |justice|Justice| ,  |property|Property| ,  |rights|Rights| ,  |law|Law| , and the enforcement of laws by  |authority|Authority| |government_legitimate|The_Purpose_Of_Government| , what rights and freedoms it should protect, what form it should take, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.     Political theory also engages questions of a broader scope, tackling the political nature of phenomena and categories such as  |identity|Identity| ,  |culture|Cultural_Studies| ,  |sexuality|Queer_Theory| ,  |race|Critical_Race_Theory| ,  |wealth|Political_Economy| ,  |human_nonhuman_relations|Critical_Animal_Studies| ,  |ecology|Ecosophy| ,  |religion|Political_Theology| , and more.     Political philosophy is a branch of  |philosophy|Philosophy| , Strauss, Leo . An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10. but it has also been a major part of  |political_science|Political_Science| , within which a strong focus has historically been placed on both the history of political thought and contemporary political theory .     In the Oxford Handbook in Political Theory , the field is described as: an interdisciplinary endeavor whose center of gravity lies at the humanities end of the happily still undisciplined discipline of political science ... For a long time, the challenge for the identity of political theory has been how to position itself productively in three sorts of location: in relation to the academic disciplines of political science, history, and philosophy; between the world of politics and the more abstract, ruminative register of theory; between canonical political theory and the newer resources  on which political theorists increasingly draw.                    |Indian_political_philosophy|Indian_Political_Philosophy|  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between nation and state religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. Mantranga, the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive .      |Chanakya|Chanakya|  was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The  Arthashastra  provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.  Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.  Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.   An example of a  |code_of_law|Code_Of_Law|  in ancient India is the  |Manusmṛti|Manusmṛti|  or  |Laws_of_Manu|Manu_Smriti| .                Chinese political philosophy dates back to the  |Spring_and_Autumn_period|Spring_And_Autumn_Period| , specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the  |Warring_States_period|Warring_States_Period| . The major philosophies during the period,  |Confucianism|Confucianism| ,  |Legalism|Legalism| ,  |Mohism|Mohism| ,  |Agrarianism|School_Of_Agrarianism|  and  |Taoism|Taoism| , each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as  |Confucius|Confucius| ,  |Mencius|Mencius| , and  |Mozi|Mozi| , focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical,  |meritocratic|Meritocracy|  government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly  |authoritarian|Authoritarian|  government based on  |draconian|Wikt_Draconian|  punishments and laws.  |Mohism|Mohism|  advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on  |frugality|Frugality|  and  |ascetism|Ascetism| . The Agrarians advocated a peasant  |utopian|Utopian| |_communalism|Communalism|  and  |egalitarianism|Egalitarianism| .  Taoism advocated a proto- |anarchism|Anarchism| . Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the  |Qin_Dynasty|Qin_Dynasty| , but was replaced by State Confucianism in the  |Han_Dynasty|Han_Dynasty| . Prior to Chinas adoption of  |communism|Communism| , State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.        Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of  |ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| , where political philosophy dates back to at least  |Plato|Plato| .  Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into five categories of descending stability and morality:  |monarchy|Monarchy| ,  |timocracy|Timocracy| ,  |oligarchy|Oligarchy| ,  |democracy|Democracy|  and  |tyranny|Tyranny| . One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Platos Republic, which was followed by  |Aristotles|Aristotle|   Nicomachean Ethics  and  |Politics|Politics| .  Roman political philosophy was influenced by the  |Stoics|Stoics|  and the Roman statesman  |Cicero|Cicero| .                 The early  |Christian_philosophy|Christian_Philosophy|  of  |Augustine_of_Hippo|Augustine_Of_Hippo|  was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the  |Stoicism|Stoicism|  and theory of  |justice|Justice|  of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying  |mercy|Mercy|  as a  |moral_example|Moral_Example| . Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the  |City_of_God|City_Of_God|  or the City of Man . Augustines  City of God  is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on  |Earth|Earth| .              |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  meticulously dealt with the varieties of  |philosophy_of_law|Philosophy_Of_Law| . According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:     Eternal law    |Divine_positive_law|Divine_Law| |_Natural_law|Natural_Law|    Human law      Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of  |canon_law|Canon_Law| . There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.     Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the  |Natural_Law_tradition|Natural_Law| .                The rise of  |Islam|Islam| , based on both the  |Quran|Quran|  and  |Muhammad|Muhammad|  strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region.  |Early_Islamic_philosophy|Early_Islamic_Philosophy|  emphasized an inexorable link between  |science|Science|  and  |religion|Religion| , and the process of  |ijtihad|Ijtihad|  to find  |truth|Truth| —in effect all philosophy was  |political|Political_Aspects_Of_Islam|  as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the rationalist  |Mutazilite|Mutazilite|  philosophers, who held a more  |Hellenic|Hellenistic_Philosophy|  view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the  |Caliphate|Caliphate| . By the late ancient period, however, the traditionalist  |Asharite|Asharite|  view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.        |Islamic_political_philosophy|Islamic_Philosophy| , was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of  |Islam|Islam| —i.e., the  |Quran|Quran|  and the  |Sunnah|Sunnah| , the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam:  |al_Kindi|Al_Kindi|  ,  |al_Farabi|Al_Farabi|  ,  |İbn_Sina|Avicenna|  ,  |Ibn_Bajjah|Ibn_Bajjah|  and  |Ibn_Rushd|Averroes|  . The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah ,  |sultan|Sultan| ,  |ummah|Ummah| , cemaa -and even the core terms of the Quran—i.e.,  |ibadah|Ibadah|  , din , rab and  |ilah|Ilah|  —is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other  |jurists|Fiqh|  and  |ulama|Ulema|  posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the  |Khawarij|Kharijites|  in the very early years of  |Islamic_history|Muslim_History|  on  |Khilafa|Caliphate|  and  |Ummah|Ummah| , or that of  |Shia_Islam|Shia_Islam|  on the concept of  |Imamah|Imamah|  are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the  |Ehl_i_Sunna|Sunni_Islam|  and  |Shia|Shia_Islam|  in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however.  |Aristotleanism|Aristotelianism|  flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the  |peripatetic|Peripatetic_School|  philosophers who implemented the ideas of  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occur because of certain rules , not because god interfered directly .        Other notable political philosophers of the time include  |Nizam_al_Mulk|Nizam_Al_Mulk| , a Persian scholar and  |vizier|Vizier|  of the Seljuq Empire who composed the  Siyasatnama , or the Book of Government in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs , as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy. In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the  |Turkmens|Turkmens|  who were coming from the north .          The 14th-century  |Arab|Arab|  scholar  |Ibn_Khaldun|Ibn_Khaldun|  is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist  |Ernest_Gellner|Ernest_Gellner|  considered Ibn Khalduns definition of  |government|Government| , ...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself, the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.         |Medieval|Medieval|  political philosophy in Europe was heavily influenced by Christian thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite  |Islamic|Islamic|  thinking in that the  |Roman_Catholics|Roman_Catholic|  thought subordinating  |philosophy|Philosophy|  to  |theology|Theology|  did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.  Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St.  |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  who helped reintroduce  |Aristotles|Aristotle|  works, which had only been transmitted to  |Catholic|Catholic|  Europe through  |Muslim|Muslim|  Spain, along with the commentaries of  |Averroes|Averroes| . Aquinass use of them set the agenda, for  |scholastic|Scholasticism|  political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| .      Some medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in his  Summa Theologica , developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown. Others, like  |Nicole_Oresme|Nicole_Oresme|  in his  Livre de Politiques , categorically denied this right to overthrow an unjust ruler.     The  |Magna_Carta|Magna_Carta| , viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justices sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.        During the  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , the academic field was wholly  |scholastic|Scholasticism|  and therefore Christian in nature.         One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was  |Niccolò_Machiavellis|Niccolò_Machiavelli|   The Prince , written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavellis death. That work, as well as  The Discourses , a rigorous analysis of  |classical_antiquity|Classical_Antiquity| , did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority  interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.  Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the  |Republic_of_Florence|Republic_Of_Florence|  rather than the  |oligarchy|Oligarchy|  of the di  |Medici|Medici|  family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a  |pragmatic|Pragmatism|  and somewhat  |consequentialist|Consequentialist|  view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power.  |Thomas_Hobbes|Thomas_Hobbes| , well known for his theory of the  |social_contract|Social_Contract| , goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the  |English_Renaissance|English_Renaissance| . Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.        During the  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  period, new theories emerged about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies , and the  |Haitian_Revolution|Haitian_Revolution| . These new theories led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as  |Thomas_Hobbes|Thomas_Hobbes| ,  |John_Locke|John_Locke| ,  |Montesquieu|Montesquieu|  and  |Jean_Jacques_Rousseau|Jean_Jacques_Rousseau| .     These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of state and government. It was decided that state would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term government would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in  |political_science|Political_Science| , although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and  |cultural_anthropologists|Cultural_Anthropology|  have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of  |natural_order|Natural_Order|  was not introduced, the  |social_sciences|Social_Sciences|  could not evolve independently of  |theistic|Theistic|  thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.      Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the  |guild|Guild|  was subordinated to the theory of  |free_trade|Free_Trade| , and  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by  |Protestant|Protestant|  churches subordinate to each  |nation_state|Nation_State| , which also preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was  |François_Marie_Arouet_de_Voltaire|François_Marie_Arouet_De_Voltaire| , a representative figure of the enlightenment. After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.      In the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the  |New_World|New_World|  and the advanced civilizations of the  |Aztec|Aztec| ,  |Maya|Maya_Civilization| ,  |Inca|Inca| ,  |Mohican|Mohican| , Delaware,  |Huron|Wyandot_People|  and especially the  |Iroquois|Iroquois| . The  |Iroquois|Iroquois|  philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States: for example,  |Benjamin_Franklin|Benjamin_Franklin|  was a great admirer of some of the methods of the  |Iroquois_Confederacy|Iroquois_Confederacy| , and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.           |John_Locke|John_Locke|  in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work  Two Treatises of Government . In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir  |Robert_Filmers|Robert_Filmer|  paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the  |divine_right_of_kings|Divine_Right_Of_Kings|  became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotles dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinass preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from  |original_sin|Original_Sin| , Locke believes mans mind comes into this world as  |tabula_rasa|Tabula_Rasa| . For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.       The  |Marxist|Karl_Marx|  critique of capitalism—developed with  |Friedrich_Engels|Friedrich_Engels| —was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The  |industrial_revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  produced a parallel revolution in political thought.  |Urbanization|Urbanization|  and  |capitalism|Capitalism|  greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the  |socialist_movement|History_Of_Socialism|  began to form. In the mid-19th century,  |Marxism|Marxism|  was developed, and  |socialism|Socialism|  in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin| ,  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong| ,  |Ho_Chi_Minh|Ho_Chi_Minh| , and  |Fidel_Castro|Fidel_Castro| . Though  |Hegels|Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel|  philosophy of history is similar to  |Immanuel_Kants|Immanuel_Kant| , and  |Karl_Marxs|Karl_Marx|  theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kants view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegels dialectic, which was standing on its head , the right side up again .  Unlike Marx who believed in  |historical_materialism|Historical_Materialism| , Hegel believed in the  Phenomenology of Spirit .  By the late 19th century,  |socialism|Socialism|  and  |trade_unions|Trade_Union|  were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of  |anarchism|Anarchism| , with thinkers such as  |Mikhail_Bakunin|Mikhail_Bakunin| ,  |Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon|Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon|  or  |Peter_Kropotkin|Peter_Kropotkin| , and  |syndicalism|Syndicalism|  also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world,  |anti_imperialism|Anti_Imperialism|  and  |pluralism|Pluralism|  began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.      |World_War_I|World_War_I|  was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The  |Russian_Revolution_of_1917|Russian_Revolution_Of_1917|  brought  |communism|Communism| —and in particular the political theory of  |Leninism|Leninism| , but also on a smaller level  |Luxemburgism|Luxemburgism|  —on the world stage. At the same time,  |social_democratic|Social_Democracy|  parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of  |universal_suffrage|Universal_Suffrage| .        From the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  until 1971, when  |John_Rawls|John_Rawls|  published  A Theory of Justice , political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and  |behavioralism|Behavioralism| . In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with  |Marxism|Marxism|  dominating the field. This was the time of  |Jean_Paul_Sartre|Jean_Paul_Sartre|  and  |Louis_Althusser|Louis_Althusser| , and the victories of  |Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong|  in China and  |Fidel_Castro|Fidel_Castro|  in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the  |New_Left|New_Left| . A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including  |Karl_Popper|Karl_Popper| ,  |Friedrich_Hayek|Friedrich_Hayek| ,  |Leo_Strauss|Leo_Strauss| ,  |Hannah_Arendt|Hannah_Arendt| ,  |Isaiah_Berlin|Isaiah_Berlin| ,  |Eric_Voegelin|Eric_Voegelin|  and  |Judith_Shklar|Judith_Shklar| —encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.      |Communism|Communism|  remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s.  |Colonialism|Colonialism|  and  |racism|Racism|  were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a  |pragmatic|Pragmatism|  approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how to apply  |utilitarianism|Utilitarianism|  to problems of political policy, or how to apply economic models  to political issues. The rise of  |feminism|Feminism| ,  |LGBT_social_movements|Lgbt_Social_Movements|  and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as  |African_Americans|African_Americans|  and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist,  |postcolonial|Postcolonial| , and  |multicultural|Multicultural|  thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the  |social_contract|Social_Contract|  by philosophers  |Charles_W_Mills|Charles_W_Mills|  in his book  The Racial Contract  and  |Carole_Pateman|Carole_Pateman|  in her book  The Sexual Contract  that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.     In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of  |John_Rawlss|John_Rawls|   A Theory of Justice  in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a  |thought_experiment|Thought_Experiment| , the  |original_position|Original_Position| , in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice.  |Robert_Nozicks|Robert_Nozick|  1974 book  Anarchy, State, and Utopia , which won a  |National_Book_Award|National_Book_Award| , responded to Rawls from a  |libertarian|Libertarianism|  perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints. David Lewis Schaefer, ,  |The_New_York_Sun|The_New_York_Sun| , April 30, 2008.     Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the  |Frankfurt_School|Frankfurt_School| , thinkers like  |Herbert_Marcuse|Herbert_Marcuse| ,  |Theodor_W_Adorno|Theodor_W_Adorno| ,  |Max_Horkheimer|Max_Horkheimer| , and  |Jürgen_Habermas|Jürgen_Habermas|  combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on  |structuralism|Structuralism|  and on a return to  |Hegel|Hegel|  . Within the structuralist line are thinkers such as  |Gilles_Deleuze|Gilles_Deleuze| ,  |Michel_Foucault|Michel_Foucault| ,  |Claude_Lefort|Claude_Lefort| , and  |Jean_Baudrillard|Jean_Baudrillard| . The  |Situationists|Situationist_International|  were more influenced by Hegel;  |Guy_Debord|Guy_Debord| , in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of  |commodity_fetishism|Commodity_Fetishism|  to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.     Another debate developed around the criticisms of liberal political theory made by  |Michael_Walzer|Michael_Walzer| ,  |Michael_Sandel|Michael_Sandel|  and  |Charles_Taylor|Charles_Taylor| . The  |liberal|Liberalism| - |communitarian|Communitarian|  debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective. These and other communitarians  argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of  |social_capital|Social_Capital| .     A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of  |deliberative_democracy|Deliberative_Democracy| . The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in Germany, but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as  |Jane_Mansbridge|Jane_Mansbridge| , Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson. Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, Democracy and Disagreement . Also see Gutmann and Thompson, Why Deliberative Democracy? .     A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are  |republicanism|Republicanism|  and the  |capability_approach|Capability_Approach| . The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from  |Isaiah_Berlins|Isaiah_Berlin|  positive and negative forms of liberty, namely liberty as non-domination. Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as non-interference, non-domination entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian  |Quentin_Skinner|Quentin_Skinner| , jurist  |Cass_Sunstein|Cass_Sunstein| , and political philosopher  |Philip_Pettit|Philip_Pettit| . The capability approach, pioneered by economists  |Mahbub_ul_Haq|Mahbub_Ul_Haq|  and  |Amartya_Sen|Amartya_Sen|  and further developed by legal scholar  |Martha_Nussbaum|Martha_Nussbaum| , understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.     Another important strand of contemporary political theory in North America draws on thinkers such as  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche| ,  |Michel_Foucault|Michel_Foucault| ,  |Jacques_Derrida|Jacques_Derrida| , and  |Gilles_Deleuze|Gilles_Deleuze| , among others, to develop critiques and articulate alternatives to the sufficiency of the  |liberal|Liberalism| - |communitarian|Communitarianism|  debate and  |republicanism|Republicanism|  discourse. Since the 1990s, these political theorists, broadly engaging the  |genealogical_approach|Genealogy|  , |_deconstruction|Deconstruction|  , and  |_weak_ontology|Weak_Ontology|  , have expanded the scope of political theory and issued a variety of arguments on topics such as  |pluralism|Pluralism| ,  |agonism|Agonism| ,  |gender_performativity|Performativity| , secularism   , and more recently the Anthropocene  and the non-human turn  . The works of  |Judith_Butler|Judith_Butler| ,  |William_E_Connolly|William_E_Connolly| ,  |Wendy_Brown|Wendy_Brown| ,  |Jane_Bennett|Jane_Bennett| , and  |Bonnie_Honig|Bonnie_Honig|  have been highly pertinent in this regard.       A larger  |list_of_political_philosophers|List_Of_Political_Philosophers|  is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most  |canonical|Archetype|  or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.    |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  Treatise on Law , Aquinas contends that Gods gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.    |Aristotle|Aristotle|  Politics  as an extension of his  Nicomachean Ethics .
