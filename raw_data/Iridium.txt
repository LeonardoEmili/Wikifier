                 Iridium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Ir and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white  |transition_metal|Transition_Metal|  of the  |platinum_group|Platinum_Group| , iridium is the second-densest metal  with a density of  as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. At room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, iridium has a calculated density  higher than osmium measured the same way. It is the most  |corrosion|Corrosion| -resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000  °C. Although only certain molten salts and  |halogens|Halogen|  are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.     Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural  |platinum|Platinum| .  |Smithson_Tennant|Smithson_Tennant| , the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess  |Iris|Iris| , personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is  |one_of_the_rarest_elements|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  in  |Earths_crust|Crust_Earths_Crust| , with annual production and consumption of only three  |tonnes|Tonne| . 191 Ir and 193 Ir are the only two naturally occurring  |isotopes|Isotope|  of iridium, as well as the only  |stable_isotopes|Stable_Isotope| ; the latter is the more abundant.     The most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with  |chlorine|Chlorine| , though iridium also forms a number of  |organometallic_compounds|Organometallic_Compound|  used in industrial  |catalysis|Catalysis| , and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance  |spark_plugs|Spark_Plug| ,  |crucibles|Crucible|  for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the  |chloralkali_process|Chloralkali_Process| . Iridium radioisotopes are used in some  |radioisotope_thermoelectric_generators|Radioisotope_Thermoelectric_Generator| .     Iridium is found in meteorites in much higher abundance than in the Earths crust.  For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the  |Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Boundary|  gave rise to the  |Alvarez_hypothesis|Alvarez_Hypothesis|  that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the  |extinction_of_dinosaurs_and_many_other_species_66_million_years_ago|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Extinction_Event| . Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean|  suggested the  |Eltanin_impact|Eltanin_Impact|  of about 2.5 million years ago.     It is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and  |tendency|Goldschmidt_Classificationsiderophile_Elements|  of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.              A member of the  |platinum_group|Platinum_Group| |metals|Metal| , iridium is white, resembling  |platinum|Platinum| , but with a slight yellowish cast. Because of its  |hardness|Hardness| , brittleness, and very high  |melting_point|Melting_Point| , solid iridium is difficult to machine, form, or work; thus  |powder_metallurgy|Powder_Metallurgy|  is commonly employed instead. It is the only metal to maintain good mechanical properties in air at temperatures above . It has the 10th highest  |boiling_point_among_all_elements|List_Of_Elements_By_Boiling_Point|  and becomes a  |superconductor|Superconductor|  at temperatures below 0.14   |K|Kelvin| .      Iridiums  |modulus_of_elasticity|Modulus_Of_Elasticity|  is the second-highest among the metals, only being surpassed by  |osmium|Osmium| . This, together with a high  |shear_modulus|Shear_Modulus|  and a very low figure for  |Poissons_ratio|Poissons_Ratio|  , indicate the high degree of  |stiffness|Stiffness|  and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridiums high cost, a number of applications have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.     The measured  |density|Density|  of iridium is only slightly lower than that of osmium, the  |densest_metal|List_Of_Elements_By_Density|  known.   Some ambiguity occurred regarding which of the two elements was denser, due to the small size of the difference in density and difficulties in measuring it accurately,  but, with increased accuracy in factors used for calculating density  |X_ray_crystallographic|X_Ray_Crystallography|  data yielded densities of 22.56  g/cm 3 for iridium and 22.59  g/cm 3 for osmium.        Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known: it is not attacked by almost any  |acid|Acid| ,  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| , molten metals, or silicates at high temperatures. It can, however, be attacked by some molten  |salts|Salt| , such as  |sodium_cyanide|Sodium_Cyanide|  and  |potassium_cyanide|Potassium_Cyanide| ,  as well as  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and the  |halogens|Halogen|    at higher temperatures.  Iridium also reacts directly with  |sulfur|Sulfur|  at atmospheric pressure to yield  |iridium_disulfide|Iridium_Disulfide| .                Iridium forms compounds in  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  between −3 and +9; the most common oxidation states are +3 and +4. Well-characterized examples of the high +6 oxidation state are rare, but include  and two mixed oxides  and .   In addition, it was reported in 2009 that  |iridium_oxide|Iridium_Oxide|   was prepared under matrix isolation conditions by UV irradiation of an iridium-peroxo complex. This species, however, is not expected to be stable as a bulk solid at higher temperatures.  The highest oxidation state , which is also the highest recorded for any element, is only known in one cation, ; it is only known as gas-phase species and is not known to form any  |salts|Salt| .      |Iridium_dioxide|Iridium_Oxide| , , a blue black solid, is the only well-characterized oxide of iridium. A  |sesquioxide|Sesquioxide| , , has been described as a blue-black powder which is oxidized to  by . The corresponding disulfides, diselenides, sesquisulfides, and sesquiselenides are known, and  has also been reported. Iridium also forms iridates with oxidation states +4 and +5, such as  and , which can be prepared from the reaction of  |potassium_oxide|Potassium_Oxide|  or  |potassium_superoxide|Potassium_Superoxide|  with iridium at high temperatures.      Although no  |binary|Binary_Compound| |hydrides|Hydride|  of iridium,  are known, complexes are known that contain  and , where iridium has the +1 and +3 oxidation states, respectively.  The ternary hydride  is believed to contain both the  and the 18-electron  anion.      No monohalides or dihalides are known, whereas trihalides, , are known for all of the halogens. For oxidation states +4 and above, only the  |tetrafluoride|Iridium_Fluoride| ,  |pentafluoride|Iridium_Fluoride|  and  |hexafluoride|Iridium_Hexafluoride|  are known. Iridium hexafluoride, , is a volatile and highly reactive yellow solid, composed of octahedral molecules. It decomposes in water and is reduced to , a crystalline solid, by iridium black. Iridium pentafluoride has similar properties but it is actually a  |tetramer|Tetramer| , , formed by four corner-sharing octahedra. Iridium metal dissolves in molten alkali-metal cyanides to produce the  ion.        Hexachloroiridic acid, , and its ammonium salt are the most important iridium compounds from an industrial perspective. They are involved in the purification of iridium and used as precursors for most other iridium compounds, as well as in the preparation of  |anode|Anode|  coatings. The  ion has an intense dark brown color, and can be readily reduced to the lighter-colored  and vice versa.  |Iridium_trichloride|Iridium_Chloride| , , which can be obtained in anhydrous form from direct oxidation of iridium powder by  |chlorine|Chlorine|  at 650  °C, or in hydrated form by dissolving  in  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| , is often used as a starting material for the synthesis of other Ir compounds. Another compound used as a starting material is ammonium hexachloroiridate, . Iridium complexes are  |diamagnetic|Diamagnetic|   and generally have an  |octahedral_molecular_geometry|Octahedral_Molecular_Geometry| .      |Organoiridium_compounds|Organoiridium_Compound|  contain iridium– |carbon|Carbon|  bonds where the metal is usually in lower oxidation states. For example, oxidation state zero is found in  |tetrairidium_dodecacarbonyl|Tetrairidium_Dodecacarbonyl| , , which is the most common and stable binary  |carbonyl|Metal_Carbonyl|  of iridium. In this compound, each of the iridium atoms is bonded to the other three, forming a tetrahedral cluster. Some organometallic Ir compounds are notable enough to be named after their discoverers. One is  |Vaskas_complex|Vaskas_Complex| , , which has the unusual property of binding to the  |dioxygen_molecule|Dioxygen_Molecule| , .  Another one is  |Crabtrees_catalyst|Crabtrees_Catalyst| , a  |homogeneous_catalyst|Homogeneous_Catalyst|  for  |hydrogenation|Hydrogenation|  reactions.  These compounds are both  |square_planar|Square_Planar| , d 8 complexes, with a total of 16  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron| , which accounts for their reactivity.      An iridium-based organic  |LED|Led|  material has been documented, and found to be much brighter than  |DPA|9_10_Diphenylanthracene|  or  |PPV|Poly| , so could be the basis for flexible OLED lighting in the future. . furuyametals.co.jp          Iridium has two naturally occurring, stable  |isotopes|Isotope| , 191 Ir and 193 Ir, with  |natural_abundances|Natural_Abundance|  of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively. At least 37  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  have also been synthesized, ranging in  |mass_number|Mass_Number|  from 164 to 202.  |_192_Ir|Iridium_192| , which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a  |half_life|Half_Life|  of 73.827  days, and finds application in  |brachytherapy|Brachytherapy|  and in industrial  |radiography|Radiography| , particularly for nondestructive testing of welds in steel in the oil and gas industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day— 188 Ir, 189 Ir, and 190 Ir. Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of  |β_decay|Beta_Decayβ_Decay| ,  |α_decay|Alpha_Decay| , and  |proton_emission|Proton_Emission| , with the exception of 189 Ir, which decays by  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture| . Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by  |β_−_decay|Beta_Decayβ_Decay| , although 192 Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path.  All known isotopes of iridium were discovered between 1934 and 2008, with the most recent discoveries being 200–202 Ir.      At least 32  |metastable_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  have been characterized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 197. The most stable of these is 192m2 Ir, which decays by  |isomeric_transition|Isomeric_Transition|  with a half-life of 241  years, making it more stable than any of iridiums synthetic isotopes in their ground states. The least stable isomer is 190m3 Ir with a half-life of only 2  µs. The isotope 191 Ir was the first one of any element to be shown to present a  |Mössbauer_effect|Mössbauer_Effect| . This renders it useful for  |Mössbauer_spectroscopy|Mössbauer_Spectroscopy|  for research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.            The discovery of iridium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group.  |Native|Native_Metal|  platinum used by ancient Ethiopians  and by South American cultures  always contained a small amount of the other platinum group metals, including iridium. Platinum reached Europe as platina , found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the  |department_of_Chocó|Department_Of_Chocó|  in  |Colombia|Colombia| .  The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.        Chemists who studied platinum dissolved it in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia|   to create soluble salts. They always observed a small amount of a dark, insoluble residue.  |Joseph_Louis_Proust|Joseph_Louis_Proust|  thought that the residue was  |graphite|Graphite| . The French chemists  |Victor_Collet_Descotils|Victor_Collet_Descotils| ,  |Antoine_François_comte_de_Fourcroy|Antoine_François_Comte_De_Fourcroy| , and  |Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin|Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin|  also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.     In 1803, British scientist  |Smithson_Tennant|Smithson_Tennant|  analyzed the insoluble residue and concluded that it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene, from the Greek word  ptēnós, winged .   Tennant, who had the advantage of a much greater amount of residue, continued his research and identified the two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue, iridium and osmium. He obtained dark red crystals  by a sequence of reactions with  |sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  and  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| . He named iridium after Iris , the Greek winged goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods, because many of the  |salts|Salt|  he obtained were strongly colored. Iridium literally means of rainbows .  Discovery of the new elements was documented in a letter to the  |Royal_Society|Royal_Society|  on June 21, 1804.         British scientist  |John_George_Children|John_George_Children|  was the first to melt a sample of iridium in 1813 with the aid of the greatest galvanic battery that has ever been constructed . The first to obtain high-purity iridium was  |Robert_Hare|Robert_Hare|  in 1842. He found it had a density of around 21.8  g/cm 3 and noted the metal is nearly immalleable and very hard. The first melting in appreciable quantity was done by  |Henri_Sainte_Claire_Deville|Henri_Sainte_Claire_Deville|  and  |Jules_Henri_Debray|Jules_Henri_Debray|  in 1860. They required burning more than 300  liters of pure  and  gas for each kilogram of iridium.     These extreme difficulties in melting the metal limited the possibilities for handling iridium.  |John_Isaac_Hawkins|John_Isaac_Hawkins|  was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880,  |John_Holland|John_Holland|  and  |William_Lofland_Dudley|William_Lofland_Dudley|  were able to melt iridium by adding  |phosphorus|Phosphorus|  and patented the process in the United States; British company  |Johnson_Matthey|Johnson_Matthey|  later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium at a number of  |World_Fairs|Worlds_Fair| . The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in  |thermocouples|Thermocouple|  was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000  °C.     In Munich, Germany in 1957  |Rudolf_Mössbauer|Rudolf_Mössbauer| , in what has been called one of the landmark experiments in twentieth-century physics ,  discovered the resonant and  |recoil|Atomic_Recoil| -free emission and absorption of  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Ray|  by atoms in a solid metal sample containing only 191 Ir.  This phenomenon, known as the  |Mössbauer_effect|Mössbauer_Effect|  , and developed as  |Mössbauer_spectroscopy|Mössbauer_Spectroscopy| , has made important contributions to research in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, metallurgy, and mineralogy.  Mössbauer received the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  in 1961, at the age 32, just three years after he published his discovery.  In 1986  |Rudolf_Mössbauer|Rudolf_Mössbauer|  was honored for his achievements with the Albert Einstein Medal and the Elliot Cresson Medal.             Iridium is one of the nine least abundant stable elements in Earths crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001   |ppm|Parts_Per_Million|  in crustal rock;  |platinum|Platinum|  is 10 times more abundant,  |gold|Gold|  is 40 times more abundant, and  |silver|Silver|  and  |mercury|Mercury|  are 80 times more abundant.  |Tellurium|Tellurium|  is about as abundant as iridium. In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in  |meteorites|Meteorite| , with concentrations of 0.5  ppm or more. The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and  |siderophilic|Goldschmidt_Classification|  character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into  |Earths_core|Earths_Core|  when the planet was still molten.      Iridium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural  |alloys|Alloy| ; especially the iridium–osmium alloys,  |osmiridium|Osmiridium|  , and  |iridosmium|Iridosmium|  .  In the  |nickel|Nickel|  and  |copper|Copper|  deposits, the platinum group metals occur as  |sulfides|Sulfide|  ,  |tellurides|Telluride|  ,  |antimonides|Antimonide|  , and  |arsenides|Arsenide|  . In all of these compounds, platinum is exchanged by a small amount of iridium and osmium. As with all of the platinum group metals, iridium can be found naturally in alloys with raw nickel or  |raw_copper|Native_Copper| .  A number of iridium-dominant minerals, with iridium as the species-forming element, are known. They are exceedingly rare and often represent the iridium analogues of the above-given ones. The examples are irarsite and cuproiridsite, to mention some.          Within Earths crust, iridium is found at highest concentrations in three types of geologic structure: igneous deposits , impact craters, and deposits reworked from one of the former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the  |Bushveld_igneous_complex|Bushveld_Igneous_Complex|  in  |South_Africa|South_Africa| ,  though the large copper–nickel deposits near  |Norilsk|Norilsknorilsk_Talnakh_Nickel_Deposits|  in  |Russia|Russia| , and the  |Sudbury_Basin|Sudbury_Basin|  in  |Canada|Canada|  are also significant sources of iridium. Smaller reserves are found in the United States. Iridium is also found in secondary deposits, combined with platinum and other platinum group metals in  |alluvial|Alluvium|  deposits. The alluvial deposits used by  |pre_Columbian|Pre_Columbian|  people in the  |Chocó_Department|Chocó_Department|  of  |Colombia|Colombia|  are still a source for platinum-group metals.  As of 2003, world reserves have not been estimated.                 The  |Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary|Cretaceous–Paleogene_Boundary|  of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal border between the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  and  |Paleogene|Paleogene|  periods of  |geological_time|Geologic_Time_Scale| , was identified by a thin  |stratum|Stratum|  of  |iridium_rich_clay|Iridium_Anomaly| . A team led by  |Luis_Alvarez|Luis_Walter_Alvarez|  proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an  |asteroid|Asteroid|  or  |comet|Comet|  impact.  Their theory, known as the  |Alvarez_hypothesis|Alvarez_Hypothesis| , is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian  |dinosaurs|Dinosaur| . A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under what is now the  |Yucatán_Peninsula|Yucatán_Peninsula|  .   Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of  |volcanic|Volcano|  origin instead, because  |Earths|Earth|  core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as  |Piton_de_la_Fournaise|Piton_De_La_Fournaise| , in the island of  |Réunion|Réunion| , are still releasing iridium.                    Iridium is also obtained commercially as a by-product from  |nickel|Nickel|  and  |copper|Copper|  mining and processing. During  |electrorefining_of_copper|Copper_Extraction_Techniqueselectrorefining|  and nickel, noble metals such as silver, gold and the  |platinum_group_metals|Platinum_Group_Metal|  as well as  |selenium|Selenium|  and  |tellurium|Tellurium|  settle to the bottom of the cell as anode mud, which forms the starting point for their extraction. To separate the metals, they must first be brought into solution. Several separation methods are available depending on the nature of the mixture; two representative methods are fusion with  |sodium_peroxide|Sodium_Peroxide|  followed by dissolution in  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| , and dissolution in a mixture of  |chlorine|Chlorine|  with  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| .     After the mixture is dissolved, iridium is separated from the other platinum group metals by precipitating  |ammonium_hexachloroiridate|Ammonium_Hexachloroiridate|   or by extracting  with organic amines.  The first method is similar to the procedure Tennant and Wollaston used for their separation. The second method can be planned as continuous  |liquid–liquid_extraction|Liquid–Liquid_Extraction|  and is therefore more suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or  sponge  that can be treated using  |powder_metallurgy|Powder_Metallurgy|  techniques.       Iridium prices have fluctuated over a considerable range. With a relatively small volume in the world market , the iridium price reacts strongly to instabilities in production, demand,  |speculation|Speculation| , hoarding, and politics in the producing countries.   As a substance with rare properties, its price has been particularly influenced by changes in modern technology:   The gradual decrease between 2001 and 2003 has been related to an oversupply of Ir crucibles used for industrial growth of large single crystals.    Likewise the prices above 1000 & 8239;USD/oz between 2010 and 2014 have been explained with the installation of production facilities for single crystal  |sapphire|Corundumsynthetic_Corundum|  used in  |LED|Led|  backlights for TVs.            The demand for iridium surged from 2.5 tonnes in 2009 to 10.4 tonnes in 2010, mostly because of electronics-related applications that saw a rise from 0.2 to 6 tonnes – iridium  |crucibles|Crucible|  are commonly used for growing large high-quality single crystals, demand for which has increased sharply. This increase in iridium consumption is predicted to saturate due to accumulating stocks of crucibles, as happened earlier in the 2000s. Other major applications include spark plugs that consumed 0.78 tonnes of iridium in 2007, electrodes for the  |chloralkali_process|Chloralkali_Process|  and chemical catalysts .           The high melting point, hardness and corrosion resistance of iridium and its alloys determine most of its applications. Iridium and mostly iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored  |spinnerets|Spinneret| , through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as  |rayon|Rayon| .  Osmium–iridium is used for  |compass|Compass|  bearings and for balances.      Their resistance to arc erosion makes iridium alloys ideal for electrical contacts for  |spark_plugs|Spark_Plug| ,  and iridium-based spark plugs are particularly used in aviation.     Pure iridium is extremely brittle, to the point of being hard to weld because the heat-affected zone cracks, but it can be made more ductile by addition of small quantities of  |titanium|Titanium|  and  |zirconium|Zirconium|  .      Corrosion and heat resistance makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts are made of an iridium alloy, and an iridium– |titanium|Titanium|  alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The  |Vickers_hardness|Vickers_Hardness|  of pure platinum is 56  HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium can reach over 500  HV.       Devices that must withstand extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature  |crucibles|Crucible|  made of iridium are used in the  |Czochralski_process|Czochralski_Process|  to produce oxide single-crystals  for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers.   The crystals, such as  |gadolinium_gallium_garnet|Gadolinium_Gallium_Garnet|  and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100  °C.     Iridium compounds are used as  |catalysts|Catalysis|  in the  |Cativa_process|Cativa_Process|  for  |carbonylation|Carbonylation|  of  |methanol|Methanol|  to produce  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid| .      The radioisotope  |iridium_192|Iridium_192|  is one of the two most important sources of energy for use in industrial  |γ_radiography|Industrial_Radiographyradioisotope_Sources|  for  |non_destructive_testing|Non_Destructive_Testing|  of  |metals|Metal| .   Additionally, 192 Ir is used as a source of  |gamma_radiation|Gamma_Radiation|  for the treatment of cancer using  |brachytherapy|Brachytherapy| , a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Specific treatments include high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, bilary duct brachytherapy, and intracavitary cervix brachytherapy.     In February 2019, medical scientists announced that iridium attached to  |albumin|Albumin| , creating a  |photosensitized_molecule|Photosensitizer| , can penetrate  |cancer_cells|Cancer_Cells|  and, after being irradiated with light , destroy the cancer cells.       Iridium is a good catalyst for the decomposition of  |hydrazine|Hydrazine|  , and this is used in practice in low-thrust rocket engines; there are more details in the  |monopropellant_rocket|Monopropellant_Rocket|  article.          An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium was used in 1889 to construct the  |International_Prototype_Metre|International_Prototype_Metre|  and  |kilogram|Kilograminternational_Prototype_Kilogram|  mass, kept by the  |International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures|Bureau_International_Des_Poids_Et_Mesures|  near  |Paris|Paris| . The meter bar was replaced as the definition of the fundamental unit of length in 1960 by a line in the  |atomic_spectrum|Atomic_Spectrum|  of  |krypton|Kryptonmetric_Role| , The definition of the meter was changed again in 1983. The meter is currently defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of  of a second.  but the kilogram prototype remained the international standard of mass  |until_20_May_2019|2019_Redefinition_Of_Si_Base_Units| , when the kilogram was redefined in terms of the  |Planck_constant|Planck_Constant| . General section citations: Recalibration of the U.S. National Prototype Kilogram, R.S.Davis, Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards, 90, No. 4,  1985 ; and The Kilogram and Measurements of Mass and Force, Z.J.Jabbour et al., J. Res. Natl. Inst. Stand. Technol. 106, 2001,        Iridium is often used as a coating for non-conductive materials in preparation for observation in  |scanning_electron_microscopes|Scanning_Electron_Microscopes|  .   The addition of a 2-20  nm layer of iridium helps especially organic materials survive electron beam damage and reduces static charge build up within the target area of the SEM beams focal point.    A coating of iridium also increases the signal to noise ratio associated with secondary electron emission which is essential to using SEMs for X-Ray spectrographic composition analysis.   While other metals can be used for coating objects for SEM use, Iridium is the preferred coating when samples will be studied with a wide variety of imaging parameters.      Iridium has been used in the  |radioisotope_thermoelectric_generators|Radioisotope_Thermoelectric_Generator|  of unmanned spacecraft such as the  Voyager ,  Viking ,  Pioneer ,  Cassini ,  Galileo , and  New Horizons . Iridium was chosen to encapsulate the  |plutonium_238|Plutonium_238|  fuel in the generator because it can withstand the operating temperatures of up to 2000  °C and for its great strength.     Another use concerns X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes.  The mirrors of the  |Chandra_X_ray_Observatory|Chandra_X_Ray_Observatory|  are coated with a layer of iridium 60   |nm|Nanometer|  thick. Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under  |high_vacuum|Vacuum|  on a base layer of  |chromium|Chromium| .      Iridium is used in  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics|  for the production of  |antiprotons|Antiproton| , a form of  |antimatter|Antimatter| . Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although  |tungsten|Tungsten|  may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the  |shock_waves|Shock_Wave|  induced by the temperature rise due to the incident beam.          |Carbon–hydrogen_bond_activation|C_H_Bond_Activation|  is an area of research on reactions that cleave  |carbon–hydrogen_bonds|Carbon–Hydrogen_Bond| , which were traditionally regarded as unreactive. The first reported successes at activating C–H bonds in  |saturated_hydrocarbons|Saturated_Hydrocarbon| , published in 1982, used organometallic iridium complexes that undergo an  |oxidative_addition|Oxidative_Addition|  with the hydrocarbon.     Iridium complexes are being investigated as catalysts for  |asymmetric_hydrogenation|Asymmetric_Hydrogenation| . These catalysts have been used in the synthesis of  |natural_products|Natural_Product|  and able to hydrogenate certain difficult substrates, such as unfunctionalized alkenes, enantioselectively .       Iridium forms a variety of  |complexes|Complex|  of fundamental interest in triplet harvesting.               Iridium–osmium alloys were used in  |fountain_pen|Fountain_Pen| |nib_tips|Nib_Nib_Tipping| . The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold. Since 1944, the famous  |Parker_51|Parker_51|  fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy . The tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called iridium , although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as ruthenium, osmium and tungsten have taken its place.      An iridium–platinum alloy was used for the  |touch_holes|Touch_Hole|  or vent pieces of  |cannon|Cannon| . According to a report of the  |Paris_Exhibition_of_1867|Exposition_Universelle| , one of the pieces being exhibited by  |Johnson_and_Matthey|Johnson_And_Matthey|  has been used in a Withworth gun for more than 3000 rounds, and scarcely shows signs of wear yet. Those who know the constant trouble and expense which are occasioned by the wearing of the vent-pieces of cannon when in active service, will appreciate this important adaptation .      The pigment iridium black, which consists of very finely divided iridium, is used for painting  |porcelain|Porcelain|  an intense black; it was said that all other porcelain black colors appear grey by the side of it .        Iridium in bulk metallic form is not biologically important or hazardous to health due to its lack of reactivity with tissues; there are only about 20   |parts_per_trillion|Parts_Per_Notation|  of iridium in human tissue. Like most metals, finely divided iridium powder can be hazardous to handle, as it is an irritant and may ignite in air.    Very little is known about the toxicity of iridium compounds, because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.     A radioisotope of iridium, , is dangerous, like other radioactive isotopes. The only reported injuries related to iridium concern accidental exposure to radiation from  used in  |brachytherapy|Brachytherapy| .  High-energy gamma radiation from  can increase the risk of cancer. External exposure can cause burns,  |radiation_poisoning|Radiation_Poisoning| , and death. Ingestion of 192 Ir can burn the linings of the stomach and the intestines.  192 Ir, 192m Ir, and 194m Ir tend to deposit in the  |liver|Liver| , and can pose health hazards from both  |gamma|Gamma_Radiation|  and  |beta|Beta_Particle|  radiation.
