     The geography of Antarctica is dominated by its  |south_polar_location|Polar_Region|  and, thus, by  |ice|Ice| . The  |Antarctic|Antarctica| |continent|Continent| , located in the  |Earths|Earth| |southern_hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere| , is centered asymmetrically around the  |South_Pole|South_Pole|  and largely south of the  |Antarctic_Circle|Antarctic_Circle| . It is washed by the  |Southern_Ocean|Southern_Ocean|  or, depending on definition, the southern  |Pacific|Pacific_Ocean| ,  |Atlantic|Atlantic_Ocean| , and  |Indian_Oceans|Indian_Ocean| . It has an area of more than 14 million  km².     Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the  |Antarctic_ice_sheet|Antarctic_Ice_Sheet| , the worlds largest  |ice_sheet|Ice_Sheet|  and also its largest reservoir of  |fresh_water|Fresh_Water| . Averaging at least 1.6  km thick, the ice is so massive that it has  |depressed_the_continental_bedrock|Post-Glacial_Rebound|  in some areas more than 2.5  km below sea level;  |subglacial_lakes|Subglacial_Lake|  of liquid water also occur .  |Ice_shelves|Ice_Shelf|  and  |rises|Ice_Rise|  populate the ice sheet on the periphery.     In September 2018, researchers at the  |National_Geospatial-Intelligence_Agency|National_Geospatial-Intelligence_Agency|  released a  of Antarctica, named the  |Reference_Elevation_Model_of_Antarctica|Reference_Elevation_Model_Of_Antarctica|  .              Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by  |Transantarctic_Mountains|Transantarctic_Mountains|  close to the neck between the  |Ross_Sea|Ross_Sea|  and the  |Weddell_Sea|Weddell_Sea| .  |Western_Antarctica|Western_Antarctica|  and  |Eastern_Antarctica|Eastern_Antarctica|  correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the  |Greenwich_meridian|Prime_Meridian| . This usage has been regarded as  |Eurocentric|Eurocentrism|  by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica are sometimes preferred.     Lesser Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this  |ice_sheet|Ice_Sheet| , because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.       Volcanoes that occur underneath glacial ice sheets are known by the term  |Glaciovolcanism|Glaciovolcanism|  , or  |subglacial_volcanoes|Subglacial_Volcano| . An article published in 2017 claims that researchers from Edinburgh University recently discovered 91 new volcanoes below the Antarctic ice sheet, adding to the 47 volcanoes that were already known  . As of today, there have been 138 possible volcanoes identified in  |West_Antarctica|West_Antarctica| . van Wyk de Vries, M., Bingham, R. G. & Hein, A. S. A new volcanic province: an inventory of subglacial volcanoes in West Antarctica. Geol. Soc. Lond. Spec. Publ. 461 . There is limited knowledge about West Antarctic Volcanoes due to the presence of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which heavily covers the  |West_Antarctic_Rift_System|West_Antarctic_Rift_System|  -- a likely hub for volcanic activity.  Researchers find it difficult to properly identify volcanic activity due to the comprehensive ice covering.      |East_Antarctica|East_Antarctica|  is significantly larger than West Antarctica, and similarly remains widely unexplored in terms of its volcanic potential. While there are some indications that there is volcanic activity under the  |East_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet|East_Antarctic_Ice_Sheet| , there is not a significant amount of present information on the subject.     Mount Erebus is one of the most notable sites in the study of Antarctic Volcanism, in that it is the southernmost historically active volcanic site on the planet.       |Deception_Island|Deception_Island|  is another active Antarctic volcano. It is one of the most protected areas in the Antarctic, given its situation between the  |South_Shetland_Islands|South_Shetland_Islands|  and the  |Antarctic_Peninsula|Antarctic_Peninsula| . As the most active volcano in the Antarctic peninsula, it has been studied closely since its initial discovery in 1820.     There are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that are   considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or   recent tephra deposits:    |Mount_Melbourne|Mount_Melbourne|  , a stratovolcano;    |Mount_Berlin|Mount_Berlin|  , a stratovolcano;   Mount Kauffman , a stratovolcano; and    |Mount_Hampton|Mount_Hampton|  , a volcanic caldera.     Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.    |Mount_Erebus|Mount_Erebus|  , a stratovolcano on    |Ross_Island|Ross_Island|  with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.   On the opposite side of the continent,    |Deception_Island|Deception_Island|    , a volcanic caldera with 10 known   and 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.    |Buckle_Island|Buckle_Island|  in the  |Balleny_Islands|Balleny_Islands|  ,    |Penguin_Island|Penguin_Island|  ,    |Paulet_Island|Paulet_Island|  , and    |Lindenberg_Island|Lindenberg_Island|  are also   considered to be active. In 2017, the researchers of  |Edinburgh_University|Edinburgh_University|  discovered 91 underwater volcanoes under  |West_Antarctica|West_Antarctica| .        |Glaciovolcanism|Glaciovolcanism| |Glaciovolcanism|Glaciovolcanism|  is “the interactions of magma with ice in all its forms, including snow, firn and any meltwater.” Smellie, 2000. Subglacial eruptions. InEncyclopaedia of Volcanoes. Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 403-418. Smellie, 2006. The relative importance of supraglacial versus subglacial meltwater escape in basaltic subglacial tuya eruptions: an important unresolved conundrum. Earth-Science Reviews, 74, 241-268. It defines a special field of volcanic that is specifically centered around ice and ice melt. This field of science is less than 100 years old, and thus continuously makes new discoveries. Glaciovolcanism is characterized by three kinds of eruptions:  |sub-glacial_eruptions,|Subglacial_Eruption|  supraglacial volcanism, and ice-marginal volcanism.      The study of glaciovolcanism is vital to the understanding of ice sheet formation. It is also a valuable tool to predict volcanic hazards, such as the ash hazard following the  |Eyjafjallajökull|Eyjafjallajökull|  eruption in Iceland.       The  |Marie_Byrd_Land_is|Marie_Byrd_Land|  an incredibly large portion of West Antarctica, consisting of the Area below the  |Antarctic_Peninsula|Antarctic_Peninsula| . The Marie Byrd land is a large formation of volcanic rock, characterized by 18 exposed and subglacial volcanoes. 16 of the 18 volcanoes are entirely covered by the antarctic ice sheet. Winberry, J. P. & Anandakrishnan, S. Crustal structure of the West Antarctic rift system and Marie Byrd Land hotspot. Geology 32, 977–980 . There have been no eruptions recorded from any of the volcanoes in this area, however scientists believe that some of the volcanoes may be potentially active.         Scientists and researchers debate whether or not the 138 identified possible volcanoes are active or  |dormant.|Dormant_Volcano|  It is very hard to definitively say, given that many of these volcanic structures are buried underneath several kilometers of ice. LeMasurier, W. E. Neogene extension and basin deepening in the West Antarctic rift inferred from comparisons with the East African rift and other analogs. Geology 36, 247–250 . However, ash layers within the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Iverson, N. A. et al. The first physical evidence of subglacial volcanism under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Sci. Rep. 7, 11457 . , as well as deformations in the ice surface Behrendt, J. C., Finn, C. A., Blankenship, D. D. & Bell, R. E. Aeromagnetic evidence for a volcanic caldera complex beneath the divide of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Geophys. Res. Lett. 25, 4385–4388 . indicate that the West Antarctic Rift System could be active and contain erupting volcanoes. Additionally, seismic activity in the region hints at magma movement beneath the crust, a sign of volcanic activity. Winberry, J. P. & Anandakrishnan, S. Crustal structure of the West Antarctic rift system and Marie Byrd Land hotspot. Geology 32, 977–980 . Despite this, however, there is not yet definitive evidence of presently active volcanoes.      |Subglacial_volcanism|Subglacial_Volcanism|  is often characterized by ice melt and subglacial water. King, E. C., Woodward, J. & Smith, A. M. Seismic evidence for a water-filled canal in deforming till beneath Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica. Geophys. Lett. 31 . Though there are other sources of subglacial water, such as geothermal heat, it almost always is a condition of volcanism. Scientists remain uncertain about the presence of water underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, with some claiming to have found evidence indicating the existence.       In West Antarcticas Marie Byrd Land, volcanoes are typically composed of alkaline and basaltic lava. Sometimes, the volcanoes are entirely basaltic in composition. Due to the geographic similarity of the Marie Byrd Land, it is believed that the volcanoes in the West African Rift System are also composed of basalt.      Above-ice basaltic volcanoes, also known as subaerial basaltic volcanoes, generally form in tall, broad cone shapes.  Since they are formed from repeated piling of liquid magma sourced from the center, they spread widely and grow upwards relatively slowly.  However, West Antarctic Volcanoes form underneath ice sheets, and are thus categorized as subglacial volcanoes. Subglacial volcanoes that are  |monogenetic|Monogenetic_Volcanic_Field|  are far more narrow, steeper, flat topped structures.  |Polygenetic|Polygenetic_Volcanic_Field|  subglacial volcanoes have a wider variety of shapes and sizes due to being made up of many different eruptions. Often, they look more cone shaped, like  |statovolcanoes|Stratovolcano| .                Recently, in 2017, a study found evidence of subglacial volcanic activity within the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This activity poses a threat to the stability of the Ice Sheet, as volcanic activity leads to increased melting.  This could possibly plunge the West Antarctic Ice Sheet into a positive feedback loop of rising temperatures and increased melting.                There are three vast canyons that run for hundreds of kilometers, cutting through tall mountains. None of the canyons are visible at the snow-covered surface of the continent since they are buried under hundreds of meters of ice. The largest of the canyons is called Foundation Trough and is over 350km long and 35km wide. The Patuxent Trough is more than 300km long and over 15km wide, while the Offset Rift Basin is 150km long and 30km wide. These three troughs all lie under and cross the so-called ice divide - the high ice ridge that runs all the way from the South Pole out towards the coast of West Antarctica.                 |West_Antarctica|West_Antarctica|  is the smaller part of the continent, , divided into:        |Antarctic_Peninsula|Antarctic_Peninsula| |Graham_Land|Graham_Land| |Palmer_Land|Palmer_Land| |Queen_Elizabeth_Land|Queen_Elizabeth_Land| |Ellsworth_Land|Ellsworth_Land| |English_Coast|English_Coast| |Bryan_Coast|Bryan_Coast| |Eights_Coast|Eights_Coast| |Marie_Byrd_Land|Marie_Byrd_Land| |Walgreen_Coast|Walgreen_Coast| |Bakutis_Coast|Bakutis_Coast| |Hobbs_Coast|Hobbs_Coast| |Ruppert_Coast|Ruppert_Coast| |Saunders_Coast|Saunders_Coast| |King_Edward_VII_Land|King_Edward_Vii_Land| |Shirase_Coast|Shirase_Coast| |Scotia_Sea|Scotia_Sea| |Weddell_Sea|Weddell_Sea| |Bellingshausen_Sea|Bellingshausen_Sea| |Amundsen_Sea|Amundsen_Sea|        Larger ice shelves are:    |Filchner-Ronne_Ice_Shelf|Filchner-Ronne_Ice_Shelf| |Larsen_Ice_Shelf|Larsen_Ice_Shelf| |Abbot_Ice_Shelf|Abbot_Ice_Shelf| |Getz_Ice_Shelf|Getz_Ice_Shelf| |Sulzberger_Ice_Shelf|Sulzberger_Ice_Shelf| |Ross_Ice_Shelf|Ross_Ice_Shelf|    For all ice shelves see  |List_of_Antarctic_ice_shelves|List_Of_Antarctic_Ice_Shelves| .
