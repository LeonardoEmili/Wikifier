|Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  built extermination camps  during  |the_Holocaust|The_Holocaust|  in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , to systematically murder millions of  |Jews|Jews| . Others were murdered at the death camps as well, including  |Poles|Poles| , homosexuals,  |Soviet_POWs|German_Mistreatment_Of_Soviet_Prisoners_Of_War| , and  |Roma|Romani_People| . The victims of death camps were primarily killed  |by_gassing|Gas_Chambernazi_Germany| , either in permanent installations constructed for this specific purpose, or by means of  |gas_vans|Nazi_Gas_Van| . Some  |Nazi_camps|Nazi_Camps| , such as  |Auschwitz|Auschwitz|  and  |Majdanek|Majdanek| , served a dual purpose before the  |end_of_the_war_in_1945|End_Of_World_War_Ii_In_Europe| |extreme_work_under_starvation_conditions|Extermination_Through_Labour| .  Also in:       The idea of mass extermination with the use of stationary facilities to which the victims were  |taken_by_train|Holocaust_Trains| , was the result of earlier Nazi experimentation with chemically manufactured poison gas during the secretive  |Aktion_T4|Aktion_T4|  euthanasia programme against hospital patients with mental and physical disabilities.   The technology was adapted, expanded, and applied in wartime to unsuspecting victims of many ethnic and national groups; the Jews were the primary target, accounting for over 90 percent of the extermination camp death toll.

Extermination camps were also set up by the  |fascist|Fascism| |Ustaše|Ustaše|  regime of the  |Independent_State_of_Croatia|Independent_State_Of_Croatia| , a  |puppet_state|Puppet_State|  of Germany, which carried out genocide between 1941 and 1945 against  |Serbs|Serbs| , Jews,  |Roma|Romani_People|  and its  |Croat|Croats|  and  |Bosniak_Muslim|Bosniak|  political opponents.              After the  |invasion_of_Poland|Invasion_Of_Poland|  in September 1939, the secret  |Aktion_T4|Aktion_T4| |euthanasia|Involuntary_Euthanasia|  programme  – the systematic murder of German, Austrian and Polish hospital patients with mental or physical disabilities  – was initiated by the  SS  in order to eliminate  |life_unworthy_of_life|Life_Unworthy_Of_Life|  , a Nazi designation for people who had no  |right_to_life|Right_To_Life| .   In 1941, the experience gained in the secretive killing of these hospital patients led to the creation of extermination camps for the implementation of the Final Solution. By then, the  |Jews|Jews|  were already  |confined_to_new_ghettos|Jewish_Ghettos_In_German-Occupied_Poland|  and interned in  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps|  along with other targeted groups, including Roma, and the Soviet POWs. The Nazi Endlösung der Judenfrage , based on the systematic killing of Europes Jews by gassing, began during  |Operation_Reinhard|Operation_Reinhard| ,  after the onset of the  |Nazi-Soviet_war|Operation_Barbarossa|  of June 1941. The adoption of the gassing technology by Nazi Germany was preceded by a wave of hands-on killings carried out by the SS  Einsatzgruppen ,  who followed the  |Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht|  army during  |Operation_Barbarossa|Operation_Barbarossa|  on the Eastern Front.      The camps designed specifically for the mass gassings of Jews were established in the months following the  |Wannsee_Conference|Wannsee_Conference|  chaired by  |Reinhard_Heydrich|Reinhard_Heydrich|  in January 1942 in which the principle was made clear that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated. Responsibility for the logistics were to be executed by the programme administrator,  |Adolf_Eichmann|Adolf_Eichmann| .      On 13 October 1941, the  |SS_and_Police_Leader|Ss_And_Police_Leader| |Odilo_Globocnik|Odilo_Globocnik|  stationing in  |Lublin|Lublin_Reservation|  received an oral order from  Reichsführer-SS   |Heinrich_Himmler|Heinrich_Himmler|   – anticipating the  |fall_of_Moscow|Battle_Of_Moscow|   – to start immediate construction work on the killing centre at  |Bełżec|Bełżec_Extermination_Camp|  in the  |General_Government|General_Government|  territory of occupied Poland. Notably, the order preceded the Wannsee Conference by three months,  but the gassings at  |Kulmhof|Kulmhof|  north of  |Łódź|Łódź|  using  |gas_vans|Nazi_Gas_Van|  began already in December, under Sturmbannführer  |Herbert_Lange|Herbert_Lange| .  The camp at Bełżec was operational by March 1942, with leadership brought in from Germany under the guise of  |Organisation_Todt|Organisation_Todt|   . By mid-1942, two more death camps had been built on Polish lands for Operation Reinhard:  |Sobibór|Sobibór_Extermination_Camp|  under the command of Hauptsturmführer  |Franz_Stangl|Franz_Stangl| , and  |Treblinka|Treblinka|  under Obersturmführer  |Irmfried_Eberl|Irmfried_Eberl|  from  |T4|Action_T4| , the only doctor to have served in such a capacity.  Also in:   |Auschwitz_concentration_camp|Auschwitz_Concentration_Camp|  was fitted with brand new gassing bunkers in March 1942.   |Majdanek|Majdanek_Concentration_Camp|  had them built in September.             The Nazis distinguished between extermination and concentration camps, although the terms extermination camp  and death camp  were interchangeable, each referring to camps whose primary function was  |genocide|Genocide| . Todeslagers were designed specifically for the systematic killing of people delivered en masse by the  |Holocaust_trains|Holocaust_Trains| . The executioners did not expect the prisoners to survive more than a few hours beyond arrival at  |Belzec|Belzec_Extermination_Camp| ,  |Sobibór|Sobibór| , and  |Treblinka|Treblinka| .  The Reinhard extermination camps were under Globocniks direct command; each of them was run by 20 to 35 men from the  SS-Totenkopfverbände  branch of the  Schutzstaffel , augmented by about one hundred  |Trawnikis|Trawnikis|   –  |auxiliaries|Hiwi|  mostly from Soviet Ukraine, and up to one thousand  Sonderkommando  slave labourers each.  The Jewish men, women and children were delivered from  |the_ghettos|Ghettos_In_Nazi-Occupied_Europe|  for special treatment in an atmosphere of terror by  |uniformed_police_battalions|Ordnungspolizeipolice_Battalions|  from both, Orpo and  |Schupo|Schutzpolizei| .      Death camps differed from concentration camps located in Germany proper, such as  |Bergen-Belsen|Bergen-Belsen_Concentration_Camp| ,  |Oranienburg|Oranienburg| ,  |Ravensbrück|Ravensbrück_Concentration_Camp| , and  |Sachsenhausen|Sachsenhausen| , which were prison camps set up prior to World War II for people defined as undesirable. From March 1936, all  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps|  were managed by the  SS-Totenkopfverbände  , who operated extermination camps from 1941 as well.  An  |SS_anatomist|Schutzstaffel| , Dr.  |Johann_Kremer|Johann_Kremer| , after witnessing the gassing of victims at  |Birkenau|Birkenau| , wrote in his diary on 2 September 1942:  |Dantes_Inferno|Inferno|  seems to me almost a comedy compared to this. They dont call Auschwitz the camp of annihilation for nothing!  The distinction was evident during the  |Nuremberg_trials|Nuremberg_Trials| , when  |Dieter_Wisliceny|Dieter_Wisliceny|   was asked to name the extermination camps, and he identified  |Auschwitz|Auschwitz_Concentration_Camp|  and  |Majdanek|Majdanek|  as such. Then, when asked, How do you classify the camps  |Mauthausen|Mauthausen-Gusen_Concentration_Camp| ,  |Dachau|Dachau_Concentration_Camp| , and  |Buchenwald|Buchenwald_Concentration_Camp| ? , he replied, They were normal concentration camps, from the point of view of the department of Eichmann. Overy, Richard. Interrogations, p. 356–357. Penguin 2002.           Irrespective of round-ups for extermination camps, the Nazis abducted millions of foreigners  |for_slave_labour|Forced_Labour_Under_German_Rule_During_World_War_Ii|  in  |other_types_of_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Campstypes_Of_Camps| ,  which provided perfect cover for the extermination programme.  Prisoners represented about a quarter of the total workforce of the Reich, with mortality rates exceeding 75 percent due to starvation, disease, exhaustion, executions, and physical brutality.          In the early years of World War II, the Jews were primarily sent to forced labour camps and ghettoised, but  |from_1942_onward|Wannsee_Conference|  they were deported to the extermination camps under the guise of resettlement . For political and logistical reasons, the most infamous  |Nazi_German|Nazi_German|  killing factories were built in  |occupied_Poland|Occupied_Poland| , where most of the intended victims lived; Poland had the greatest  |Jewish_population|Polish_Jews|  in  |Nazi-controlled_Europe|German-Occupied_Europe| . , Jewish Virtual Library.. Retrieved 28 July 2009. On top of that, the new death camps outside the prewar borders of the Third Reich proper could be kept secret from the German civil populace.       thu   During the initial phase of the Final Solution , gas van s producing poisonous exhaust fumes were developed in the occupied Soviet Union and at the Chełmno extermination camp in occupied Poland , before being used elsewhere. The killing method was based on experience gained by the SS during the secretive  |Aktion_T4|Aktion_T4|  programme of involuntary euthanasia . There were two types of death chambers operating during the Holocaust.     Unlike at Auschwitz, where the cyanide-based Zyklon-B was used to exterminate trainloads of prisoners under the guise of relocation , the camps at Treblinka , Bełżec , and Sobibór , built during Operation Reinhard , used lethal exhaust fumes produced by large internal combustion engine s. The three killing centres of Einsatz Reinhard were constructed predominantly for the extermination of Polands Jews trapped in the Nazi ghettos . At first, the victims bodies were buried with the use of crawler excavator s, but they were later exhumed and incinerated in open-air pyres to hide the evidence of genocide in what became known as Sonderaktion 1005 .     Whereas the Auschwitz II and Majdanek camps were parts of a labor camp complex, the Chełmno and Operation Reinhard death camps were built exclusively for the rapid extermination of entire communities of people within hours of their arrival. All were constructed near branch line s that linked to the Polish railway system, with staff members transferring between locations. These camps had almost identical design: they were several hundred metres in length and width, and were equipped with only minimal staff housing and support installations not meant for the unlucky hordes crammed into the railway transports . Arad 1999, p. 37.     The Nazis deceived the victims upon their arrival, telling them that they were at a temporary transit stop, and would soon continue to German Arbeitslagers farther to the east. Selected able-bodied prisoners delivered to the death camps were not immediately killed, but instead were pressed into labor units called  |Sonderkommandos|Sonderkommando|   .
