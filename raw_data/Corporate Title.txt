     Corporate titles or business titles are given to company and organization officials to show what duties and responsibilities they have in the organization. Such titles are used by publicly and privately held for-profit  |corporations|Corporation| . In addition, many  |non-profit|Non-Profit|  organizations, educational institutions,  |partnerships|Partnership| , and  |sole_proprietorships|Sole_Proprietorship|  also confer corporate titles.          There are considerable variations in the composition and responsibilities of corporate titles.     Within the corporate office or corporate center of a company, some companies have a  |chairman|Chairman|  and  |chief_executive_officer|Chief_Executive_Officer|  as the top-ranking executive, while the number two is the president and  |chief_operating_officer|Chief_Operating_Officer|  ; other companies have a president and CEO but no official deputy. Typically, senior managers are higher than  |vice_presidents|Vice_President| , although many times a senior officer may also hold a vice president title, such as executive vice president and  |chief_financial_officer|Chief_Financial_Officer|  . The  |board_of_directors|Board_Of_Directors|  is technically not part of management itself, although its chairman may be considered part of the corporate office if he or she is an executive chairman.     A corporation often consists of different businesses, whose senior executives report directly to the CEO or COO, but depends on the form of the business. If organized as a  |division|Division|  then the top manager is often known as an  |executive_vice_president|Vice_Presidenthierarchy_Of_Vice_Presidents| . If that business is a  |subsidiary|Subsidiary|  which has considerably more independence, then the title might be chairman and CEO.     In many countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, there is a separate executive board for day-to-day business and  |supervisory_board|Supervisory_Board|  for control purposes. In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between  |management|Management|  by the executive board and  |governance|Governance|  by the supervisory board. This seemingly allows for clear lines of authority. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political  |cabinet|Cabinet|  from the management  |civil_service|Civil_Service| .     In the United States and other countries that follow a single-board corporate structure, the board of directors is often equivalent to the European or Asian supervisory board, while the functions of the executive board may be vested either in the board of directors or in a separate committee, which may be called an operating committee ,  management committee , executive committee , or executive council , or executive board  composed of the division/subsidiary heads and senior officers that report directly to the CEO.         State laws in the United States traditionally required certain positions to be created within every corporation, such as  |president|President| ,  |secretary|Company_Secretary|  and  |treasurer|Treasurer| . Today, the approach under the  Model Business Corporation Act , which is employed in many states, is to grant companies discretion in determining which titles to have, with the only mandated organ being the board of directors.      Some states that do not employ the MBCA continue to require that certain offices be established. Under the law of  |Delaware|Delaware| , where most large US corporations are established, stock certificates must be signed by two officers with titles specified by law .  Every corporation incorporated in  |California|California|  must have a chairman of the board or a president , as well as a secretary and a chief financial officer.       |Limited_liability_company|Limited_Liability_Company|  -structured companies are generally run directly by their members, but the members can agree to appoint officers such as a CEO or to appoint managers to operate the company.      American companies are generally led by a CEO. In some companies, the CEO also has the title of president . In other companies, a president is a different person, and the primary duties of the two positions are defined in the companys bylaws . Many companies also have a CFO, a  |chief_operating_officer|Chief_Operating_Officer|  and other senior positions such as  |chief_information_officer|Chief_Information_Officer|  ,  |chief_business_officer|Chief_Business_Officer|  ,  |chief_marketing_officer|Chief_Marketing_Officer|  , etc. that report to the president and CEO as senior vice presidents of the company. The next level, which are not executive positions, is middle management and may be called vice presidents ,  |directors|Director|  or managers , depending on the size and required managerial depth of the company.          In British English, the title of  |managing_director|Managing_Director|  is generally synonymous with that of chief executive officer.  Managing directors do not have any particular authority under the Companies Act in the UK, but do have  |implied_authority|Implied_Authority|  based on the general understanding of what their position entails, as well as any authority expressly delegated by the board of directors.          In Japan, corporate titles are roughly standardized across companies and organizations; although there is variation from company to company, corporate titles within a company are always consistent, and the large companies in Japan generally follow the same outline.  These titles are the formal titles that are used on business cards.  Korean corporate titles are similar to those of Japan.     Legally, Japanese and Korean companies are only required to have a board of directors with at least one representative director.   In Japanese, a company director is called a torishimariyaku and a  |representative_director|Representative_Director|  is called a daihyo torishimariyaku . The equivalent Korean titles are isa and daepyo-isa . These titles are often combined with lower titles, e.g. senmu torishimariyaku or jomu torishimariyaku for Japanese executives who are also board members. Most Japanese companies also have  |statutory_auditors|Statutory_Auditor| , who operate alongside the board of directors in supervisory roles.     The typical structure of executive titles in large companies includes the following:               The top management group, comprising jomu/sangmu and above, is often referred to collectively as senior management .     Some Japanese and Korean companies have also adopted American-style titles, but these are not yet widespread and their usage varies. For example, although there is a Korean translation for chief operating officer , not many companies have yet adopted it with an exception of a few multi-national companies such as Samsung and CJ , while the CFO title is often used alongside other titles such as bu-sajang or Jŏnmu .     Since the late 1990s, many Japanese companies have introduced the title of shikko yakuin or officer , seeking to emulate the separation of directors and officers found in American companies. In 2002, the statutory title of shikko yaku was introduced for use in companies that introduced a three-committee structure in their board of directors. The titles are frequently given to bucho and higher-level personnel. Although the two titles are very similar in intent and usage, there are several legal distinctions: shikko yaku make their own decisions in the course of performing work delegated to them by the board of directors, and are considered managers of the company rather than employees, with a legal status similar to that of directors. Shikko yakuin are considered employees of the company that follow the decisions of the board of directors, although in some cases directors may have the shikko yakuin title as well.         The highest-level executives in senior management usually have titles beginning with chief and ending with officer , forming what is often called the C-Suite or CxO, where x is a variable that could be any functional area; not to be confused with CXO . The traditional three such officers are CEO, COO, and CFO. Depending on the management structure, titles may exist instead of, or be blended/overlapped with, other traditional executive titles, such as  |president|President| , various designations of vice presidents , and general managers or directors of various divisions ; the latter may or may not imply membership of the board of directors.     Certain other prominent positions have emerged, some of which are sector-specific. For example, chief audit executive , chief procurement officer and chief risk officer positions are often found in many types of financial services companies. Technology companies of all sorts now tend to have a chief technology officer to manage technology development. A CIO oversees information technology matters, either in companies that specialize in IT or in any kind of company that relies on it for supporting infrastructure.     Many companies now also have a CMO, particularly mature companies in competitive sectors, where brand management is a high priority. A chief value officer is introduced in companies where business processes and organizational entities are focused on the creation and maximization of value. A chief administrative officer may be found in many large complex organizations that have various departments or divisions. Additionally, many companies now call their top diversity leadership position the chief diversity officer . However, this and many other nontraditional and lower-ranking titles are not universally recognized as corporate officers, and they tend to be specific to particular organizational cultures or the preferences of employees.       Chairman of the board – presiding officer of the corporate board of directors. The chairman influences the board of directors, which in turn elects and removes the officers of a corporation and oversees the human, financial, environmental and technical operations of a corporation.   The CEO may also hold the title of chairman , resulting in an executive chairman. In this case, the board frequently names an independent member of the board as a lead director.   Executive chairman – the chairmans post may also exist as an office separate from that of CEO, and it is considered an executive chairman if that titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as Steve Case of AOL Time Warner and Douglas Flint of HSBC . In particular, the group chairmanship of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Prior to the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBCs chairman essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBCs chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairman oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.   Non-executive chairman – also a separate post from the CEO, unlike an executive chairman, a non-executive chairman does not interfere in day-to-day company matters. Across the world, many companies have separated the roles of chairman and CEO, often resulting in a non-executive chairman, saying that this move improves corporate governance.   Chief business officer is a corporate senior executive who assumes full management responsibility for the companys deal making, provides leadership and executes a deal strategy that will allow the company to fulfill its scientific/technology mission and build shareholder value, provides managerial guidance to the companys product development staff as needed.   Chief of staff is a corporate director level manager who has overall responsibility for the staff activity within the company who often would have responsibility of hiring and firing of the highest level managers and sometimes directors. They can work with and report directly to managing directors and the chief executive officer.   Commissioner   Financial control officer , FCO or FC, also comptroller or controller – supervises accounting and financial reporting within an organization   Director or member of a board of directors – high-level official with a fiduciary responsibility of overseeing the operation of a corporation and elects or removes officers of a corporation; nominally, directors, other than the chairman are usually not considered to be employees of the company per se, although they may receive compensation, often including benefits; in publicly held companies. A board of directors is normally made up of members  who are a mixture of corporate officials who are also management employees of the company and persons who are not employed by the company in any capacity . In privately held companies, the board of directors often only consists of the statutory corporate officials, and in sole proprietorship and partnerships, the board is entirely optional, and if it does exist, only operates in an advisory capacity to the owner or partners. Non-profit corporations’ governing board members may be called directors like most for-profit corporations, or an alternative like trustees, governors, etc.   Director – a manager of managers within an organization who is often responsible for a major business function and who sometimes reports to a vice president . Often used with name of a functional area; finance director, director of finance, marketing director, and so on. Not to be confused with a member of the board of directors, who is also referred to as a director. This is a middle management and not an executive level position, unless it is in the banking industry. Alternatively, a manager of managers is often referred to as a senior manager or as an associate vice president , depending upon levels of management, and industry type.   President – legally recognized highest titled corporate officer, and usually a member of the board of directors. There is much variation; often the CEO also holds the title of president, while in other organizations if there is a separate CEO, the president is then second highest-ranking position. In such a case the president is often the COO and is considered to be more focused upon daily operations compared to the CEO, who is supposed to be the visionary. If the corporate president is not the COO , then many division heads report directly to the CEO themselves, with the president taking on special assignments from the CEO.   Secretary or company secretary – legally recognized titled corporate officer who reports to the board of directors and is responsible for keeping the records of the board and the company. This title is often concurrently held by the treasurer in a dual position called secretary-treasurer; both positions may be concurrently held by the CFO. Note, however, that the secretary has a reporting line to the board of directors, regardless of any other reporting lines conferred by concurrent titles.   Treasurer – legally recognized corporate officer entrusted with the fiduciary responsibility of caring for company funds. Often this title is held concurrently with that of secretary in a dual role called secretary-treasurer. It can also be held concurrently with the title of CFO or fall under the jurisdiction of one, though the CFO tends to oversee the finance department instead, which deals with accounting and audits, while the treasurer deals directly with company funds. Note, however, that the treasurer has a reporting line to the board of directors, regardless of any other reporting lines conferred by concurrent titles.   Superintendent   Owner   Partner – Used in many different ways. This may indicate a co-owner as in a legal partnership or may be used in a general way to refer to a broad class of employees or temporary/contract workers who are often assigned field or customer service work. Associate is often used in a similar way.   Vice chair or vice chairman – officer of the board of directors who may stand in for the chairman in his or her absence. However, this type of vice chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one . An unrelated definition of vice chair describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than executive vice president. Sometimes, EVPs report to the vice chair, who in turn reports directly to the CEO , other vice chairs have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with EVPs. Executive vice chairman are usually not on the board of directors. Royal Bank of Canada previously used vice chairs in their inner management circle until 2004 but have since renamed them as group heads.               Supervisor   Foreman   General manager or GM   Manager   Of Counsel – A lawyer working on a part-time or temporary basis for a company or law firm.   Vice president – Middle or upper manager in a corporation. They often appear in various hierarchical layers such as executive vice president, senior vice president, associate vice president, or assistant vice president, with EVP usually considered the highest and usually reporting to the CEO or president. Many times, corporate officers such as the CFO, COO, CIO, CTO, secretary, or treasurer will concurrently hold  .
