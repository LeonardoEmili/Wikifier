        Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to manufacture  |semiconductor_devices|Semiconductor_Devices| , typically the  |metal_oxide_semiconductor|Metal_Oxide_Semiconductor|  devices used in the  |integrated_circuit|Integrated_Circuit|  chips that are present in everyday  |electrical|Electrical|  and  |electronic|Electronics|  devices. It is a multiple-step sequence of  |photolithographic|Photolithography|  and chemical processing steps  during which  |electronic_circuits|Electronic_Circuits|  are gradually created on a  |wafer|Wafer|  made of pure  |semiconducting|Semiconducting|  material.  |Silicon|Silicon|  is almost always used, but various  |compound_semiconductors|Compound_Semiconductor|  are used for specialized applications.     The entire manufacturing process, from start to packaged chips ready for shipment, takes six to eight weeks and is performed in highly specialized facilities referred to as  |foundries_or_fabs|Semiconductor_Fabrication_Plant| . In more advanced semiconductor devices, such as modern  |14|14_Nanometer| / |10|10_Nanometer| / |7_nm|7_Nanometer|  nodes, fabrication can take up to 15 weeks with 11–13 weeks being the industry average.  Production in advanced fabrication facilities is completely automated, and carried out in a hermetically sealed, nitrogen environment to improve yield with  |FOUPs|Foup|  and automated material handling systems taking care of the transport of wafers from machine to machine.     By industry standard, each generation of the semiconductor manufacturing process, also known as technology node, is designated by the process’s minimum feature size. Technology nodes, also known as process technologies or simply nodes , are typically indicated by the size in  |nanometers|Nanometers|   of the processs  |gate|Gate|  length. Since 2009, however, node has become a commercial name for marketing purposes that indicates new generations of process technologies, without any relation to gate length, metal pitch or gate pitch.    For example,  |GlobalFoundries|Globalfoundries| |_7_nm|7_Nbsp_Nm|  process is similar to  |Intels|Intel| |_10_nm|10_Nbsp_Nm|  process, thus the conventional notion of a process node has become blurred.  Additionally, TSMC and Samsungs 10  nm processes are only slightly denser than Intels 14  nm in transistor density. They are actually much closer to Intels 14  nm process than they are to Intels 10  nm process .       As of 2019,  |14_nanometer|14_Nanometer|  and  |10_nanometer|10_Nanometer|  chips are in mass production by Intel,  |UMC|United_Microelectronics_Corporation| , TSMC, Samsung,  |Micron|Micron_Technology| ,  |SK_Hynix|Sk_Hynix| ,  |Toshiba_Memory|Toshiba_Memory|  and GlobalFoundries, with  |7_nanometer|7_Nanometer|  process chips in mass production by  |TSMC|Tsmc|  and  |Samsung|Samsung| , although their 7nanometer node definition is similar to  |Intels|Intel|  10 nanometer process. The  |5_nanometer|5_Nanometer|  process began being produced by Samsung in 2018.  As of 2019, the node with the highest  |transistor_density|Transistor_Density|  is TSMCs 5nanometer N5 node,  with a density of 171.3million transistors per square millimeter.  In 2019, Samsung and TSMC announced plans to produce  |3_nanometer|3_Nanometer|  nodes. GlobalFoundries has decided to stop development of new nodes beyond 12 nanometers in order to save resources, as it has determined that setting up a new fab would be beyond the companys financial abilities.             The first  |MOSFET|Mosfet| |semiconductor_devices|Semiconductor_Device|  were fabricated by Egyptian engineer  |Mohamed_Atalla|Mohamed_Atalla|  and Korean engineer  |Dawon_Kahng|Dawon_Kahng|  at  |Bell_Labs|Bell_Labs|  between 1959 and 1960.  There were originally two types of MOSFET technology,  |PMOS|Pmos_Logic|   and  |NMOS|Nmos_Logic|  .  Both types were developed by Atalla and Kahng when they originally invented the MOSFET, fabricating both PMOS and NMOS devices with a 20 |µm|Μm|  process.     An improved type of MOSFET technology,  |CMOS|Cmos| , was developed by  |Chih_Tang_Sah|Chih_Tang_Sah|  and  |Frank_Wanlass|Frank_Wanlass|  at  |Fairchild_Semiconductor|Fairchild_Semiconductor|  in 1963.   CMOS was commercialised by  |RCA|Rca|  in the late 1960s. RCA used CMOS for its  |4000_series_integrated_circuits|4000_Series_Integrated_Circuits|  in 1968, starting with a 20µm process before gradually scaling to a  |10_µm_process|10_Nbsp_Μm_Process|  over the next several years.      Semiconductor device manufacturing has since spread from  |Texas|Texas|  and  |California|California|  in the 1960s to the rest of the world, including  |Asia|Asia| ,  |Europe|Europe| , and the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| . It is a global business today. The leading semiconductor manufacturers typically have facilities all over the world.  |Samsung|Samsung| , the worlds largest manufacturer of semiconductors, has facilities in South Korea and the US.  |Intel|Intel| , the second largest manufacturer, has facilities in Europe and Asia as well as the US.  |TSMC|Tsmc| , the worlds largest  |pure_play_foundry|Foundry_Model| , has facilities in Taiwan, China, Singapore, and the US.  |Qualcomm|Qualcomm|  and  |Broadcom|Broadcom|  are among the biggest  |fabless|Fabless|  semiconductor companies, outsourcing their production to companies like TSMC.  They also have facilities spread in different countries.         This is a list of processing techniques that are employed numerous times throughout the construction of a modern electronic device; this list does not necessarily imply a specific order.

As devices became more integrated,  |cleanrooms|Cleanroom|  must become even cleaner. Today, fabrication plants are  |pressurized|Pressurization|  with filtered air to remove even the smallest particles, which could come to rest on the wafers and contribute to defects. The workers in a semiconductor fabrication facility are required to wear  |cleanroom_suits|Cleanroom_Suit|  to protect the devices from human  |contamination|Contamination| . To prevent oxidation and to increase yield, FOUPs and semiconductor capital equipment may have a pure nitrogen environment with ISO class 1 levels of dust.          A typical  |wafer|Wafer|  is made out of extremely  |pure_silicon|Siliconproduction|  that is  |grown|Crystal_Growth|  into  |mono_crystalline|Monocrystalline_Silicon|  cylindrical  |ingots|Ingot|   up to 300  mm in diameter using the  |Czochralski_process|Czochralski_Process| . These ingots are then sliced into wafers about 0.75  mm thick and polished to obtain a very regular and flat surface.       In semiconductor device fabrication, the various processing steps fall into four general categories: deposition, removal, patterning, and modification of electrical properties.   Deposition is any process that grows, coats, or otherwise transfers a material onto the wafer. Available technologies include  |physical_vapor_deposition|Physical_Vapor_Deposition|  ,  |chemical_vapor_deposition|Chemical_Vapor_Deposition|  ,  |electrochemical_deposition|Electroplating|  ,  |molecular_beam_epitaxy|Molecular_Beam_Epitaxy|  and more recently,  |atomic_layer_deposition|Atomic_Layer_Deposition|  among others. Deposition can be understood to include  |oxide|Oxide|  layer formation, by  |thermal_oxidation|Thermal_Oxidation|  or, more specifically,  |LOCOS|Locos| .   Removal is any process that removes material from the wafer; examples include etch processes  and  |chemical_mechanical_planarization|Chemical_Mechanical_Planarization|  .   Patterning is the shaping or altering of deposited materials, and is generally referred to as  |lithography|Photolithography| . For example, in conventional lithography, the wafer is coated with a chemical called a  photoresist ; then, a machine called a  stepper  focuses, aligns, and moves a  |mask|Photomask| , exposing select portions of the wafer below to short wavelength light; the exposed regions are washed away by a developer solution. After etching or other processing, the remaining photoresist is removed by  |plasma_ashing|Plasma_Ashing| .   Modification of electrical properties has historically entailed  |doping|Semiconductor_Doping|  transistor sources and drains . These doping processes are followed by  |furnace_anneal|Furnace_Anneal| ing or, in advanced devices, by  |rapid_thermal_anneal|Rapid_Thermal_Anneal| ing ; annealing serves to activate the implanted dopants. Modification of electrical properties now also extends to the reduction of a materials  |dielectric_constant|Dielectric_Constant|  in  |low_k_insulators|Low_Κ_Dielectric|  via exposure to  |ultraviolet_light|Ultraviolet_Light|  in UV processing . Modification is frequently achieved by  |oxidation|Oxidation| , which can be carried out to create semiconductor-insulator junctions, such as in the local oxidation of  |silicon|Silicon|   to fabricate  |metal_oxide_field_effect_transistors|Mosfet| .   Modern chips have up to eleven metal levels produced in over 300 sequenced processing steps.            FEOL processing refers to the formation of the  |transistors|Transistor|  directly in the  |silicon|Silicon| . The raw wafer is engineered by the growth of an ultrapure, virtually defect-free silicon layer through  |epitaxy|Epitaxy| . In the most advanced  |logic_devices|Logic_Device| , prior to the silicon epitaxy step, tricks are performed to improve the performance of the transistors to be built. One method involves introducing a straining step wherein a silicon variant such as  |silicon_germanium|Silicon_Germanium|  is deposited. Once the epitaxial silicon is deposited, the  |crystal_lattice|Crystal_Lattice|  becomes stretched somewhat, resulting in improved electronic mobility. Another method, called  silicon on insulator  technology involves the insertion of an insulating layer between the raw silicon wafer and the thin layer of subsequent silicon epitaxy. This method results in the creation of transistors with reduced  |parasitic_effects|Parasitic_Element| .       Front-end surface engineering is followed by growth of the  |gate_dielectric|Gate_Dielectric|  , patterning of the gate, patterning of the source and drain regions, and subsequent implantation or diffusion of dopants to obtain the desired complementary electrical properties. In  |dynamic_random_access_memory|Dynamic_Random_Access_Memory|  devices, storage  |capacitors|Capacitors|  are also fabricated at this time, typically stacked above the access transistor .              Once the various semiconductor devices have been created, they must be interconnected to form the desired electrical circuits. This occurs in a series of wafer processing steps collectively referred to as BEOL . BEOL processing involves creating metal interconnecting wires that are isolated by dielectric layers. The insulating material has traditionally been a form of SiO 2 or a  |silicate_glass|Silicate_Glass| , but recently new  |low_dielectric_constant|Low_K|  materials are being used , typically providing dielectric constants around 2.7 , although materials with constants as low as 2.2 are being offered to chipmakers.            Historically, the metal wires have been composed of  aluminum . In this approach to wiring , blanket films of aluminum are deposited first, patterned, and then etched, leaving isolated wires. Dielectric material is then deposited over the exposed wires. The various metal layers are interconnected by etching holes  in the insulating material and then depositing  |tungsten|Tungsten|  in them with a  |CVD|Chemical_Vapor_Deposition|  technique; this approach is still used in the fabrication of many memory chips such as  |dynamic_random_access_memory|Dynamic_Random_Access_Memory|  , because the number of interconnect levels is small .     More recently, as the number of interconnect levels for logic has substantially increased due to the large number of transistors that are now interconnected in a modern  |microprocessor|Microprocessor| , the timing delay in the wiring has become so significant as to prompt a change in wiring material  and a change in dielectric material . This performance enhancement also comes at a reduced cost via  |damascene|Copper_Interconnectpatterning|  processing, which eliminates processing steps. As the number of interconnect levels increases, planarization of the previous layers is required to ensure a flat surface prior to subsequent lithography. Without it, the levels would become increasingly crooked, extending outside the depth of focus of available lithography, and thus interfering with the ability to pattern. CMP  is the primary processing method to achieve such planarization, although dry etch back is still sometimes employed when the number of interconnect levels is no more than three.         The highly serialized nature of wafer processing has increased the demand for  |metrology|Metrology|  in between the various processing steps. For example, thin film metrology based on  |ellipsometry|Ellipsometry|  or  |reflectometry|Reflectometry|  is used to tightly control the thickness of gate oxide, as well as the thickness,  |refractive_index_and_extinction_coefficient|Refractive_Index_And_Extinction_Coefficient_Of_Thin_Film_Materials|  of photoresist and other coatings. Wafer test metrology equipment is used to verify that the wafers havent been damaged by previous processing steps up until testing; if too many  |dies|Die|  on one wafer have failed, the entire wafer is scrapped to avoid the costs of further processing.  |Virtual_metrology|Virtual_Metrology|  has been used to predict wafer properties based on statistical methods without performing the physical measurement itself.

Once the front-end process has been completed, the semiconductor devices are subjected to a variety of electrical tests to determine if they function properly. The proportion of devices on the wafer found to perform properly is referred to as the yield. Manufacturers are typically secretive about their yields, but it can be as low as 30%.  |Process_variation|Process_Variation|  is one among many reasons for low yield.  , ACM Computing Surveys, 2015     The fab  |tests_the_chips_on_the_wafer|Wafer_Testing|  with an electronic tester that presses tiny probes against the chip. The machine marks each bad chip with a drop of dye. Currently, electronic dye marking is possible if wafer test data is logged into a central computer database and chips are binned according to the predetermined test limits. The resulting binning data can be graphed, or logged, on a wafer map to trace manufacturing defects and mark bad chips. This map can also be used during wafer assembly and packaging.     Chips are also tested again after packaging, as the bond wires may be missing, or analog performance may be altered by the package. This is referred to as the final test .     Usually, the fab charges for testing time, with prices in the order of cents per second. Testing times vary from a few milliseconds to a couple of seconds, and the test software is optimized for reduced testing time. Multiple chip testing is also possible, because many testers have the resources to perform most or all of the tests in parallel.     Chips are often designed with testability features such as  |scan_chains|Scan_Chain|  or a  |built_in_self_test|Built_In_Self_Test|  to speed testing, and reduce testing costs. In certain designs that use specialized analog fab processes, wafers are also laser-trimmed during testing, in order to achieve tightly-distributed resistance values as specified by the design.     Good designs try to test and statistically manage  corners  . Most designs cope with at least 64 corners.          Once tested, a wafer is typically reduced in thickness in a process also known as backlap ,  backfinish or wafer thinning  before the wafer is scored and then broken into individual dice, a process known as  |wafer_dicing|Wafer_Dicing| . Only the good, unmarked chips are packaged.            Plastic or ceramic packaging involves mounting the die, connecting the die pads to the pins on the package, and sealing the die. Tiny wires are used to connect the pads to the pins. In the old days, wires were attached by hand, but now specialized machines perform the task. Traditionally, these wires have been composed of gold, leading to a  |lead_frame|Lead_Frame|  of  |solder|Solder| -plated copper;  |lead|Lead|  is poisonous, so lead-free lead frames are now mandated by  |RoHS|Restriction_Of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive| .      |Chip_scale_package|Chip_Scale_Package|  is another packaging technology. A plastic  |dual_in_line_package|Dual_In_Line_Package| , like most packages, is many times larger than the actual die hidden inside, whereas CSP chips are nearly the size of the die; a CSP can be constructed for each die before the wafer is diced.     The packaged chips are retested to ensure that they were not damaged during packaging and that the die-to-pin interconnect operation was performed correctly. A laser then etches the chips name and numbers on the package.          Many toxic materials are used in the fabrication process. CNET. “.” April 25, 2002. Retrieved November 9, 2015. These include:     poisonous elemental  |dopants|Dopants| , such as  |arsenic|Arsenic| ,  |antimony|Antimony| , and  |phosphorus|Phosphorus| .   poisonous compounds, such as  |arsine|Arsine| ,  |phosphine|Phosphine| , and  |silane|Silane| .   highly reactive liquids, such as  |hydrogen_peroxide|Hydrogen_Peroxide| , fuming  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| ,  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid| , and  |hydrofluoric_acid|Hydrofluoric_Acid| .     It is vital that workers should not be directly exposed to these dangerous substances. The high degree of automation common in the IC fabrication industry helps to reduce the risks of exposure. Most fabrication facilities employ exhaust management systems, such as wet scrubbers, combustors, heated absorber cartridges, etc., to control the risk to workers and to the environment.
