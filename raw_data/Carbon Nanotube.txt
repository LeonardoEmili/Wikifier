              Carbon nanotubes  are tubes made of carbon with diameters typically measured in  |nanometers|Nanometers| .     Carbon nanotubes often refers to single-wall carbon nanotubes  with diameters in the range of a nanometer. They were discovered independently by Iijima and  and Bethune et al. In carbon arc chambers similar to those used to produce  |fullerenes|Fullerene| . Single-wall carbon nanotubes are one of the  |allotropes_of_carbon|Allotropes_Of_Carbon| , intermediate between  |fullerene|Fullerene|  cages and flat  |graphene|Graphene| .     Although not made this way, single-wall carbon nanotubes can be thought of as cutouts from a two-dimensional  |hexagonal_lattice|Hexagonal_Tiling|  of carbon atoms rolled up along one of the  |Bravais_lattice|Bravais_Lattice|  vectors of the hexagonal lattice to form a hollow cylinder. In this construction, periodic boundary conditions are imposed over the length of this roll up vector to yield a lattice with helical symmetry of seamlessly bonded carbon atoms on the cylinder surface.     Carbon nanotubes also often refer to multi-wall carbon nanotubes  consisting of nested single-wall carbon nanotubes. If not identical, these tubes are very similar to Oberlin, Endo and Koyamas long straight and parallel carbon layers cylindrically rolled around a hollow tube. Multi-wall carbon nanotubes are also sometimes used to refer to double- and triple-wall carbon nanotubes.     Carbon nanotubes can also refer to tubes with an undetermined carbon-wall structure and diameters less than 100 nanometers. Such tubes were discovered by Radushkevich and Lukyanovich. While  |nanotubes_of_other_compositions|Nanotube|  exist, most research has been focused on the carbon ones. Therefore, the carbon qualifier is often left implicit in the acronyms, and the names are abbreviated NT, SWNT, and MWNT.     Carbon nanotubes can exhibit remarkable  |electrical_conductivity|Electrical_Conductivity| . They also have exceptional  and  |thermal_conductivity|Thermal_Conductivity| , because of their  |nanostructure|Nanostructure|  and  |strength|Bond_Strength|  of the bonds between carbon atoms. In addition, they can be chemically modified. These properties are expected to be valuable in many areas of technology, such as  |electronics|Electronics| ,  |optics|Optics| ,  |composite_materials|Composite_Materials|  ,  |nanotechnology|Nanotechnology| , and other applications of  |materials_science|Materials_Science| .     Individual carbon nanotubes naturally align themselves into ropes held together by relatively weak  |van_der_Waals_forces|Van_Der_Waals_Force| . The length of a carbon nanotube produced by common production methods is often not reported, but is much larger than its diameter. Although rare, nanotubes half a meter long have been created, with a length-to-diameter ratio of more than 100,000,000:1. For many purposes, the length of carbon nanotubes can be assumed to be infinite.     Rolling up a hexagonal lattice along different directions to form different single-wall carbon nanotubes shows that all of these tubes have helical and translational symmetry along the tube axis and many also have nontrivial rotational symmetry about this axis. In addition, most are  |chiral|Chiral| , meaning the tube and its mirror image cannot be superimposed. This construction also allows single-wall carbon nanotubes to be labeled by a pair of small integers.     A special group of achiral single-wall carbon nanotubes are  |metal|Metal| lic, but all the rest are either small or moderate band gap  |semiconductors|Semiconductor| . These electrical properties, however, do not depend of whether the tube is rolled up above or below the graphene plane and hence are the same for a tube and its mirror image.            |cylindrical|Cylinder|  surface, whose vertices are the positions of the carbon atoms. Since the length of the carbon-carbon bonds is fairly fixed, there are constraints on the diameter of the cylinder and the arrangement of the atoms on it.                 In the study of nanotubes, one defines a zigzag path on a graphene-like lattice as a  |path|Path|  that turns 60 degrees, alternating left and right, after stepping through each bond. It is also conventional to define an armchair path as one that makes two left turns of 60 degrees followed by two right turns every four steps.     On some carbon nanotubes, there is a closed zigzag path that goes around the tube. One says that the tube is of the zigzag type or configuration, or simply is a zigzag nanotube. If the tube is instead encircled by a closed armchair path, it is said to be of the armchair type, or an armchair nanotube.          An infinite nanotube that is of the zigzag type consists entirely of closed zigzag paths, connected to each other.     n,m |int_backgrou|Int_Backgrou| |mred_dotsblue_do|Mred_Dotsblue_Do| n,mk,0k,kn,m−2m,n+mn,m1,2−2,3−3,1−1,−22,−33,−1k,00,kn,m .
