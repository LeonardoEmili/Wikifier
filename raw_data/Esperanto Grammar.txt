    Esperanto  is a  |constructed_language|Constructed_Language| . It is designed to have a highly regular grammar, and as such is considered an easy language to learn.     Each part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with ‑o; adjectives with ‑a; present‑tense indicative verbs with ‑as, and so on.     It is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 meaning words , though more exist in the language. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded.     Reference grammars include the  Plena Analiza Gramatiko   by  |Kálmán_Kalocsay|Kálmán_Kalocsay|  and  |Gaston_Waringhien|Gaston_Waringhien| , and the  Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko   by  |Bertilo_Wennergren|Bertilo_Wennergren| .       Esperanto has an  |agglutinative|Agglutinative_Language| |morphology|Morphology| , no  |grammatical_gender|Grammatical_Gender| , and simple  |verbal|Grammatical_Conjugation|  and  |nominal_inflections|Noun_Case| . Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, of which the  |indicative|Indicative_Mood|  has three  |tenses|Grammatical_Tense| , and are  |derived|Inflectionvs._Derivation|  for several  |aspects|Lexical_Aspect| , but do not agree with the  |grammatical_person|Grammatical_Person|  or  |number|Grammatical_Number|  of their  |subjects|Subject| .  |Nouns|Noun|  and  |adjectives|Adjective|  have two  |cases|Noun_Case| ,  |nominative|Nominative_Case| / |oblique|Oblique_Case|  and  |accusative|Accusative_Case| / |allative|Allative_Case| , and two  |numbers|Grammatical_Number| ,  |singular|Grammatical_Number|  and  |plural|Plural| ; the adjectival form of  |personal_pronouns|Personal_Pronoun|  behaves like a  |genitive_case|Genitive_Case| . Adjectives generally  |agree|Agreement|  with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating  |direct_objects|Direct_Object| , the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and  |adverbs|Adverb|  for showing the destination of a motion, or for replacing certain  |prepositions|Preposition| ; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible  |word_order|Word_Order|  that reflects  |information_flow|Information_Flow|  and other  |pragmatic|Pragmatics|  concerns, as in  |Russian|Russian_Language| ,  |Greek|Greek_Language| , and  |Latin|Latin| .            Esperanto uses the  |Latin_alphabet|Latin_Alphabet|  with six additional lettersĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭand does not use the letters q, w, x, or y.     Zamenhof suggested  |Italian|Italian_Language|  as a model for  |Esperanto_pronunciation|Esperanto_Pronunciation| .       Esperanto has a single  |definite_article|Definite_Article| , la, which is invariable. It is similar to English the .     La is used:     :For identifiable, countable objects:   ::Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon.   ::: I found a bottle and took off the lid.   :For representative individuals:   ::La gepardo estas la plej rapida el la bestoj.   ::: The cheetah is the fastest of the animals.   ::La abeloj havas felon, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi.   ::: Bees have fur, but theyre no good for petting.   :For adjectives used as nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages:   ::la blua   ::: the blue one   ::la angla   ::: English   :For  |possessive_pronouns|Possessive_Pronoun| , when definite:   ::La mia bluas, la via ruĝas.   ::: Mine is blue, yours is red .     The article is also used for  |inalienable_possession|Inalienable_Possession|  of body parts and  |kin_terms|Kinship_Terminology| , where English would use a  |possessive_adjective|Possessive_Adjective| Ili tranĉis la manon.   :: They cut their hands.     The article la, like the  |demonstrative_adjective|Demonstrative_Adjective|  tiu , occurs at the beginning of the  |noun_phrase|Noun_Phrase| .     There is no grammatically required  |indefinite_article|Indefinite_Article| homo means either human being or a human being , depending on the context, and similarly the plural homoj means human beings or some human beings . The words iu and unu  may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but theyre closer in meaning to some and a certain than to English a . This use of unu corresponds to English a when the a indicates a specific individual. Sergio Pokrovskij , in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo       The suffixes ‑o, ‑a, ‑e, and ‑i indicate that a word is a  |noun|Noun| ,  |adjective|Adjective| ,  |adverb|Adverb| , and  |infinitive|Infinitive| |verb|Verb| , respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word vidi are vida , vide , and vido .     Each  |root_word|Root_Word|  has an inherent  |part_of_speech|Part_Of_Speech| ‑o indicates an abstraction: parolo from the verbal root paroli ; belo from the adjectival root bela ; whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix ‑areĝa , from the nominal root reĝo ; parola . The various verbal endings mean to be  when added to an adjectival root: beli ; and with a nominal root they mean to act as the noun, to use the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: reĝi . There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in -e are derived: bele . Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a  |prepositional_phrase|Prepositional_Phrase| parole ; vide ; reĝe .     The meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, brosi is based on a nominal root , whereas kombi is based on a verbal root . Change the suffix to -o, and the similar meanings of brosi and kombi diverge: broso is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas kombo is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal kombi to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix -ilo is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: kombilo . On the other hand, changing the nominal root broso to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, brosi . For the name of the action, the suffix -ado will change a derived verb back to a noun: brosado . Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root requires the suffix -eco, as in infaneco , but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal -o: belo . Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as beleco are acceptable and widely used.     A limited number of basic adverbs do not end with -e, but with an undefined part-of-speech ending -aŭ. Not all words ending in -aŭ are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in -aŭ have other functions, such as hodiaŭ today or ankoraŭ yet, still About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as nun now , tro too, too much , not counting the adverbs among the  |correlatives|Table_Of_Correlatives| .      Other parts of speech occur as bare roots, without special suffixes. These are the prepositions , conjunctions , interjections , numerals , and pronouns . There are also several grammatical  |particles|Grammatical_Particle|  that fit neatly into no category, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as ne , ankaŭ , nur , eĉ .       A suffix -j following the noun or adjective suffixes -o or -a makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a  |countable_noun|Countable_Noun|  is understood to be singular.  |Direct_objects|Direct_Object|  take an  |accusative_case|Accusative_Case|  suffix -n, which goes after any plural suffix.      Adjectives  |agree|Agreement|  with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns that they  |modify|Grammatical_Modifier|  are plural, and accusative if the nouns that they modify are accusative. Compare bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn . This requirement allows for free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in  |subject–object–verb|Subject–Object–Verb|  or  |verb–subject–object|Verb–Subject–Object|  clauses:     :la knabino feliĉan knabon kisis   :la knabino feliĉa knabon kisis .     Agreement clarifies the  |syntax|Syntax|  in other ways also. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular:   :ruĝaj domo kaj aŭto   :ruĝa domo kaj aŭto .     A  |predicative_adjective|Predicative_Adjective|  does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:   :mi farbis la pordon ruĝan   :mi farbis la pordon ruĝa .       There are three types of  |pronouns|Pronoun|  in Esperanto:  |personal|Personal_Pronoun|  ,  |demonstrative|Demonstrative|  , and  |relative|Relative_Pronoun| / |interrogative|Interrogative_Word|  .   According to the fifth rule  of the Fundamento de Esperanto          The Esperanto  personal pronoun  system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of a  |reflexive_pronoun|Reflexive_Pronoun| .         Zamenhof introduced the singular second-person pronoun ci to be used in translations from languages where the  |T–V_distinction|T–V_Distinction|  is important, and added it in the Dua Libro in 1888 clarifying that this word is only found in the dictionary; in the language itself it is hardly ever used . It has never been widely used, even by Zamenhof himself, who didnt include it as a pronoun in the 5th rule of the Fundamento and in his 28th Lingva Respondo, published in 1908, recommended to use only vi. The normal usage is to use vi regardless of number or formality. However, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ci in practical speech.     Personal pronouns take the  |accusative|Accusative|  suffix -n as nouns do: min , lin , ŝin .  |Possessive_adjectives|Possessive_Adjective|  are formed with the adjectival suffix -a: mia , ĝia , nia . These agree with their noun like any other  |adjective|Adjective| ni salutis liajn amikojn . Esperanto does not have separate forms for the  |possessive_pronouns|Possessive_Pronoun| ; this sense is generally indicated with the definite article: la mia .     The  |reflexive_pronoun|Reflexive_Pronoun|  is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:   :li lavis sin he washed   :ili lavis sin they washed   :li lavis lin he washed him   :li manĝis sian panon he ate his bread   :li manĝis lian panon he ate his bread .     The indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject it with a passive verb,   :oni diras, ke ... One says that... , meaning: they say that ... or its said that ...   With impersonal verbs where there is actually no item or being that is doing an action, no pronoun is used:   :pluvas rains; is raining; its raining .     The rain is falling by itself, therefore the subject pronoun is omitted.     Ĝi is mostly used with items that have physical bodies. Zamenhof proposed that this pronoun can also be used as an  |epicene|Wikt:Epicene|  third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesnt wish to clarify the gender. Respondo 23, La Revuo, 1901, Aŭgusto However, this proposal is not generally accepted.     In popular usage its usually only used when referring to children:   :La infano estas ploranta, ĉar ĝi volas manĝi the child is crying, because it wants to eat .   When speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun tiu to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but its not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence   :Iu ĵus diris, ke tiu malsatas Someone just said that that thing/person is hungry ,   the word tiu would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking , and so cannot be used in place of ĝi, li or ŝi.       The  |demonstrative|Demonstrative_Pronoun|  and  |relative_pronouns|Relative_Pronoun|  form part of the  |correlative_system|Table_Of_Correlatives| , and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in -o and -u . Their accusative case is formed in -n, but the genitive case ends in -es, which is the same for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases lia domo and ties domo with the plural liaj domoj and ties domoj , and with the accusative genitive lian domon and ties domon. An unofficial but widely recognized accusative preposition na has become popular with some Esperantists on the internet and may be used in such situations, especially when there is no following noun . The purposefully ambiguous preposition je may be so used as well , though normally the -es words are simply not inflected for case.       Although Esperanto  |word_order|Word_Order|  is fairly free,  |prepositions|Preposition|  must come at the beginning of a  |noun_phrase|Noun_Phrase| . Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various  |cases|Case|  , in Esperanto all prepositions govern the  |nominative|Nominative| por Johano . The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is replaced by the accusative.     Prepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition je should be used:   :ili iros je la tria de majo .     Alternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:   :ili iros la trian de majo.     Note that although la trian is in the accusative, de majo is still a  |prepositional_phrase|Prepositional_Phrase| , and so the noun majo remains in the nominative case.     A frequent use of the accusative is in place of al to indicate the direction or goal of motion . It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:   :la kato ĉasis la muson en la domo    :la kato ĉasis la muson en la domon .     The accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:   :li iris al sia hejmo   :li iris hejmen     Both por and pro often translate English for. However, they distinguish for a goal  and for a cause por your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote pro your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.     The preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps de, which corresponds to English of, from, off, and  bylibro de Johano    :li venis de la butiko    :mordita de hundo      However, English of corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: de, el , and da :   :tablo el ligno    :glaso da vino    :listo da kondiĉoj de la kandidatoj    The last of these,  da , is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly. Sergio Pokrovskij, 2007.  , in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo. See the entry for  |da_at_Wiktionary|Wikt:Daesperanto| .     Occasionally a new preposition is coined. Because a bare  |root|Root|  may indicate a preposition or  |interjection|Interjection| , removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from fari we get the preposition far .       All verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses, all of which are in the  |indicative_mood|Indicative_Mood| . The other moods are the  |infinitive|Infinitive| ,  |conditional|Conditional_Mood| , and  |jussive|Jussive_Mood| . No  |aspectual|Grammatical_Aspect|  distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of  |Aktionsart|Lexical_Aspect|  are common.     Verbs do not change form according to their  |subject|Subject| . I am, we are, and he is are simply mi estas, ni estas, and li estas, respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: pluvas ; estas muso en la domo .     Most verbs are inherently  |transitive|Transitive_Verb|  or  |intransitive|Intransitive_Verb| . As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes -ig-  and -iĝ- akvo bolas je cent gradoj   :ni boligas la akvon .       The tenses have characteristic vowels. A indicates the present tense, i the past, and o the future.          The verbal forms may be illustrated with the root esper- :   :esperi   :esperas   :esperis   :esperos   :esperu   :esperus     A verb can be made emphatic with the particle ja : mi ja esperas , mi ja esperis .       As in English, Esperanto  |present_tense|Present_Tense|  may be used for generic statements such as birds fly .     The Esperanto  |future|Future_Tense|  is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English when I see you the verb see is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required:  kiam mi vidos vin.     Esperanto tense is  |relative|Relative_Tense| . This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a  |subordinate_verb|Subordinate_Clause|  is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, John said that he would go is in Esperanto Johano diris, ke li iros ; this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now , but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.       The  |conditional_mood|Conditional_Mood|  is used for such expressions as se mi povus, mi irus and se mi estus vi, mi irus .     The  |jussive_mood|Jussive_Mood| , is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the  |imperative|Imperative_Mood|  and  |subjunctive|Subjunctive| Iru!   :Mi petis, ke li venu.   :Li parolu.   :Ni iru.   :Benu ĉi tiun domaĉon.   :Mia filino belu!       The verb esti is both the  |copula|Copula|  and the existential verb. As a copula linking two  |noun_phrases|Noun_Phrase| , it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with esti can be semantically important: compare hundoj estas personoj and personoj estas hundoj .      This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry. However, the reverse is not true, as this does not change the inherent part of speech: Morti does not have the same meaning as esti morta .        |Participles|Participle|  are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:   three aspects: past , present , and future   times   two  |voices|Grammatical_Voice| |active|Active_Voice|  and  |passive|Passive_Voice|    The participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: i, a, o. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing  |voice|Grammatical_Voice| , with either nt or t following the vowel .       The basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb fali . Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are falonta . As they drop, they are falanta . After they hit the ground, they are falinta .     Active and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb haki . Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is hakonta and the tree is hakota . While swinging the axe, he is hakanta and the tree hakata . After the tree has fallen, he is hakinta and the tree hakita .     Adjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:   :ili ŝparis la arbojn hakotajn .       Compound tenses are formed with the  |adjectival_participles|Adjectival_Participle|  plus esti as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense:   Present  |progressive|Continuous_Aspect| mi estas kaptanta , mi estas kaptata   Present  |perfect|Perfect| mi estas kaptinta , mi estas kaptita   Present  |prospective|Prospective_Aspect| mi estas kaptonta , mi estas kaptota     These are not used as often as their English equivalents. For I am going to the store , you would normally use the simple present mi iras in Esperanto.     The tense and mood of esti can be changed in these compound tenses:   :mi estis kaptinta   :mi estus kaptonta   :mi estos kaptanta .     Although such  |periphrastic|Periphrastic|  constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting esti + adjective into a verb is often seen for adjectival participles:     :mi estas kaptinta or mi kaptintas   :mi estis kaptinta or mi kaptintis     The active synthetic forms are:        Infinitive and jussive forms are also found. There is a parallel passive paradigm. A few of these forms, notably -intus and -atas, entered common usage, but most of them are very rare because they are difficult to understand. Bertilo Wennergren, Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko,        Participles may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix -a with -e or -o. This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.     A nominal participle indicates one who participates in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, esperinto is a hoper , or one who had been hoping.        |Adverbial_participles|Adverbial_Participle|  are used with subjectless clauses:   :Kaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golen .       Occasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel u . Timothy Reagan Language Matters: Reflections on Educational Linguistics, p. 167 If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been  |spiked|Tree_Spiking|  and so couldnt be cut down after all, he would be hakunta and the tree hakuta .     This can also be illustrated with the verb prezidi . Just after the recount of the  |2000_United_States_presidential_election|U.S._Presidential_Election,_2000| |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  was still prezidanto of the United States,   president-elect  |George_W._Bush|George_W._Bush|  was declared prezidonto ,   the previous president  |George_H._W._Bush|George_H._W._Bush|  was a prezidinto , and   the contending candidate  |Al_Gore|Al_Gore|  was prezidunto . This example is somewhat artificial, because the customary word for president is the tense-neutral word prezidento. Prezidanto is typically used for the presidents of organizations other than sovereign countries, and prezidinto is used for former presidents in such contexts.     The tense-neutral word prezidento is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb prezidi.       A statement is made negative by using ne or one of the negative   |correlatives|Table_Of_Correlatives| . Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:     : Mi ne faris ion ajn. I didnt do anything.     Two negatives within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being a positive sentence.     : Mi ne faris nenion. Mi ja faris ion. It is not the case that I did nothing. I did do something.     The word ne comes before the word it negates:   : Mi ne skribis tion   : Ne mi skribis tion   : Mi skribis ne tion     The latter will frequently be reordered as ne tion mi skribis depending on the flow of information.            Wh questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative   |correlatives|Table_Of_Correlatives| . They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:     :Li scias, kion vi faris   :Kion vi faris?   :Vi faris kion?      Yes/no questions are marked with the conjunction ĉu :     :Mi ne scias, ĉu li venos   :Ĉu li venos?     Such questions can be answered jes or ne in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or ĝuste or malĝuste in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:     :Ĉu vi ne iris?   :— Ne, mi ne iris ; — Jes, mi iris   :— Ĝuste, mi ne iris ; — Malĝuste, mi iris     Note that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.       Basic Esperanto  |conjunctions|Grammatical_Conjunction|  are kaj , aŭ , nek , se , ĉu , sed , anstataŭ , krom , kiel , ke . Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify:     :Mi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon   :Estis nek hele nek agrable   :ĉu pro kaprico, ĉu pro natura lingvo-evoluo   :Li volus, ke ni iru     However, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from  |Don_Harlow|Don_Harlow| Li traktis min kiel princon   :Li traktis min kiel princo        |Interjections|Interjection|  may be derived from bare affixes or roots: ek! , from the perfective prefix; um , from the indefinite/undefined suffix; fek! , from feki .          Esperanto  |derivational_morphology|Morphology|  uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes . These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root vid- regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: see , sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.           The cardinal  |numerals|Numeral|  are:     :nul   :unu   :du   :tri   :kvar   :kvin   :ses   :sep   :ok   :naŭ   :dek   :cent   :mil     These are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, unu  is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning a certain , and in such cases it may take the plural affix -j, just as the demonstrative pronoun tiu does:   :unuj homoj   : certain people ;   :ili kuris unuj post la aliaj   : they ran some after others .   In such use unu is irregular in that it doesnt take the accusative affix -n in the singular, but does in the plural:   :ian unu ideon   : some particular idea ,   but   :unuj objektoj venis en unujn manojn, aliaj en aliajn manojn   : some objects came into certain hands, others into other hands .   Additionally, when counting off, the final u of unu may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:   :Un! Du! Tri! Kvar!       At numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots miliono and miliardo are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A  billion  in most English-speaking countries is different from a billion in most other countries . The international root biliono is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix -iliono to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix -iliardo:  at Reta Vortaro     :10 6 : miliono   :10 9 : miliardo    :10 12 : duiliono   :10 15 : duiliardo    :10 18 : triiliono   :10 21 : triiliardo    :etc.     Note that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: mil homojn but milionon da homoj .       Numerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added . Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix -a, quantities with the nominal suffix -o, multiples with -obl-, fractions with ‑on‑, collectives with ‑op‑, and repetitions with the root ‑foj‑.     :sescent sepdek kvin   :tria    :trie   :dudeko   :duobla   :kvarono   :duope   :dufoje     The particle po is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently, the  |logogram|Logogram| |@|@|  is not used :   :mi donis al ili po tri pomojn or pomojn mi donis al ili po tri .     Note that particle po forms a phrase with the numeral tri and is not a preposition for the noun phrase tri pomojn, so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.       Comparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives tiel ... kiel , the adverbial roots pli and plej , the antonym prefix mal-, and the preposition ol :     :mi skribas tiel bone kiel vi   :tiu estas pli bona ol tiu   :tio estas la plej bona   :la mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via     Implied comparisons are made with tre and tro .     Phrases like The more people, the smaller the portions and All the better! are translated using ju and des in place of the :   :Ju pli da homoj, des malpli grandaj la porcioj   :Des pli bone!       Esperanto has a fairly  |flexible_word_order|Free_Word_Order| . However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle ne generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause :   :mi ne iris I didnt go   :mi ne iris, mi revenis I didnt go, I came back   :ne mi iris or iris ne mi it wasnt me who went   :mi iris ne al la butiko sed hejmen I went not to the shop but home.   However, when the entire clause is negated, the ne may be left till last:   :mi iris ne I went not.     The last order reflects a typical  |topic–comment|Topic–Comment|   order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. For example, yet another order, ne iris mi, would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and mi is given as an example of one who did not go.     Compare: Sergio Pokrovskij , in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo     :Pasintjare mi feriis en Italujo   ::Last year I vacationed in Italy   :En Italujo mi feriis pasintjare   ::I vacationed in Italy last year   :En Italujo pasintjare mi feriis   ::In Italy last year I went on vacation   :En Italujo pasintjare feriis mi   ::       Within a noun phrase, either the order adjective–noun or noun–adjective may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with numeral–noun and demonstrative–noun being the norm, as in English.   :blua ĉielo a blue sky   :tiu ĉielo that sky   :tiu blua ĉielo that blue sky   :sep bluaj ĉieloj seven blue heavens     Adjective–noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective–noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:   :homo malgrandanima kaj ege avara a petty and extremely greedy person   :vizaĝo plena de cikatroj a face full of scars   :ideo fantazia sed tamen interesa a fantastic but still interesting idea     Adjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:   :okazis io stranga something strange happened   :ne ĉio brilanta estas diamanto not everything shiny is a diamond   Changing the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative nenio nothing:   :li manĝis nenion etan he ate nothing little   :li manĝis etan nenion he ate a little nothing     With multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun–numeral–:   :miaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj my two great friends.     However, the article la precedes a noun phrase:   :la blua ĉielo the blue sky     In  |prepositional_phrases|Prepositional_Phrase| , the preposition is required to come at the front of the noun phrase , though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:   :al la ĉielo to the sky or ĉielen skywards, never ĉielo al        |Constituent_order|Constituent_Order|  within a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.     The default order is  |subject–verb–object|Subject–Verb–Object| , though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:   :la hundo ĉasis la katon the dog chased/hunted the cat   :la katon ĉasis la hundo   :ĉasis la hundo la katon   :ĉasis la katon la hundo   :la hundo la katon ĉasis   :la katon la hundo ĉasis   The expectation of a topic–comment order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in la katon ĉasis la hundo, the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in la hundo la katon ĉasis, the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in ĉasis la hundo la katon, the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.     Context is required to tell whether   :la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardeno   means the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with   :la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno   ::The dog chased the cat, which was in the garden   and   :en la ĝardeno, la hundo ĉasis la katon   ::In the garden, the dog chased the cat.     Of course, if it chases the cat into the garden, the case of garden would change:   :la hundo ĉasis la katon en la ĝardenon, en la ĝardenon la hundo ĉasis la katon, etc.     Within copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions.  |Copulas|Copula|  are words such as esti be, iĝi become, resti remain, and ŝajni seem, for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun. John Wells, 1978, Lingvistikaj aspektoj de Esperanto, p 42 ff     Generally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:   :sovaĝa estas la vento wild is the wind, la vento estas sovaĝa the wind is wild   However, la vento sovaĝa estas is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as the wild wind is, leaving the reader to ask, is what?.       In the sentence above, la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu estis en la ĝardeno the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden, the  |relative_pronoun|Relative_Pronoun|  kiu which is restricted to a position after the noun cat. In general,  |relative_clauses|Relative_Clause|  and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.      |Attributive|Attributive|  prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives  as well as la kato en la ĝardeno the cat in the garden in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither la de Johano libro nor la en la ĝardeno kato is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both ĉasis en la ĝardeno and en la ĝardeno ĉasis are acceptable for chased in the garden.     Relative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a  |relative_pronoun|Relative_Pronoun|  such as kiu which:   :fuĝis la kato, kiun ĝi ĉasis the cat which it chased fled   :mi vidis la hundon, kiu ĉasis la katon I saw the dog which chased the cat   Note that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs. This is parallel to the rather archaic distinction in English between who and whom. Other sequences of case are possible, though with different readings: fuĝis la hundo, kiu ĉasis ĝin the dog which chased it fled; mi vidis la katon, kiun la hundo ĉasis I saw the cat, which the dog chased. However, they do agree in number:   :fuĝis la katoj, kiujn ĝi ĉasis the cats which it chased fled     Other word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:   :fuĝis la kato, kiun ĉasis ĝi the cat which it chased fled   :vidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon ĉasis I saw the dog which chased the cat        |Coordinate_clauses|Coordinate_Conjunction|  allow flexible word order, but tend to be  |iconic|Iconicity| . For example, in   :la hundo ĉasis la katon kaj la kato fuĝis the dog chased the cat and the cat fled,   the inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:   :la kato fuĝis, kaj la hundo ĉasis ĝin the cat fled, and the dog chased it   This distinction is lost in  |subordinate_clauses|Subordinate_Clause|  such as the relative clauses in the previous section:   :la hundo ĉasis la katon, kiu fuĝis the dog chased the cat which fled   In written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both typically have a comma in Esperanto.     Non-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the  |conjunction|Grammatical_Conjunction|  ke that, as in,   :Mi estas certa, ke vi havos brilan sukceson I am certain that you will have a brilliant success.       Esperantos vocabulary,  |syntax|Syntax| , and  |semantics|Semantics|  derive predominantly from Indo-European national languages. Roots are typically  |Romance|Romance_Languages|  or  |Germanic|Germanic_Languages|  in origin. The semantics shows a significant  |Slavic|Slavic_Languages|  influence.     It is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperantos  |agglutinative_morphology|Agglutination|  based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of  |ablaut|Ablaut|  , which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is song sing sang sung. However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as cat, cats and walk, walked do in English.  Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their weak inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as pli, plej, plu , tre, tro , and in the verbal morphemes ‑as, ‑anta, ‑ata; ‑is, ‑inta, ‑ita; ‑os, ‑onta, ‑ota; and ‑us.     Other features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the -o suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo‑European languages such as Russian. For example, Russian neuter and feminine nouns end in singular -o and -a, adjectives in -oje and -aja, adverbs in -o and -e, etc.; cf. also Provençal la fenestro , which is identical to Esperanto la fenestro. More pertinent is the accusative plural in -jn. Esperanto is superficially similar to the non‑Indo‑European  |Hungarian|Hungarian_Language|  and  |Turkish|Turkish_Language|  languages—that is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed non-European elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are accidental.     East Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as la ĉielo bluas for la ĉielo estas blua and mia filino belu! for the mia filino estu bela! mentioned above.       The  |Pater_noster|The_Lords_Prayer| , from the  |first_Esperanto_publication|Unua_Libro|  in 1887, illustrates many of the grammatical points presented above:     : Patro nia, kiu estas en la ĉieloj,   : sanktigata estu Via nomo.   : Venu Via regno,   : fariĝu Via volo,   : kiel en la ĉielo, tiel ankaŭ sur la tero.   : Nian panon ĉiutagan donu al ni hodiaŭ.   : Kaj pardonu al ni niajn ŝuldojn,   : kiel ankaŭ ni pardonas al niaj ŝuldantoj.   : Kaj ne konduku nin en tenton,   : sed liberigu nin de la malbono.   :    : Amen.     The morphologically complex words  are:   :   :   :   :   :   : .
