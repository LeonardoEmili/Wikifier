     John Sigismund  was a  |Prince_elector|Prince_Elector|  of the  |Margraviate_of_Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg|  from the  |House_of_Hohenzollern|House_Of_Hohenzollern| . He became the  |Duke_of_Prussia|Duchy_Of_Prussia|  through his marriage to  |Duchess_Anna|Anna_Duchess_Of_Prussia| , the eldest daughter of  |Duke_Albert_Frederick_of_Prussia|Albert_Frederick_Duke_Of_Prussia|  who died without sons. Their marriage resulted in the creation of  |Brandenburg_Prussia|Brandenburg_Prussia| .            John Sigismund was born in  |Halle_an_der_Saale|Halle_Saxony_Anhalt|  to  |Joachim_III_Frederick_Elector_of_Brandenburg|Joachim_Iii_Frederick_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| , and his first wife  |Catherine_of_Brandenburg_Küstrin|Catherine_Of_Brandenburg_Küstrin| . He succeeded his father as  |Margrave_of_Brandenburg|Margrave_Of_Brandenburg|  in 1608. In 1611, John Sigismund traveled from  |Königsberg|Königsberg|  to  |Warsaw|Warsaw| , where on 16 November 1611 he gave  |feudal_homage|Homage|  to  |Sigismund_III_Vasa|Sigismund_Iii_Vasa| ,  |King_of_Poland|King_Of_Poland|  . He officially became Duke of Prussia in 1618, although he had served as regent on behalf of the mentally-disturbed  |Albert_Frederick_Duke_of_Prussia|Albert_Frederick_Duke_Of_Prussia| , for several years prior. John Sigismund died in the following year.     John Sigismund gave the Reichshof  |Castrop|Castrop|  to his teacher and educator Carl Friedrich von Bordelius, whereas he received the territories of  |Cleves|Duchy_Of_Cleves| ,  |Mark|County_Of_Mark| , and  |Ravensberg|County_Of_Ravensberg|  in the  |Treaty_of_Xanten|Treaty_Of_Xanten|  in 1614.         John Sigismunds most significant action was his conversion from  |Lutheranism|Lutheranism|  to  |Calvinism|Calvinism| , after he had earlier equalized the rights of Catholics and Protestants in the Duchy of Prussia under pressure from the King of Poland. He was probably won over to Calvinism during a visit to  |Heidelberg|Heidelberg|  in 1606, but it was not until 1613 that he publicly took  |communion|Eucharist|  according to the Calvinist rite. The vast majority of his subjects in Brandenburg, including his wife  |Anna_of_Prussia|Anna_Duchess_Of_Prussia| , remained deeply Lutheran, however. After the Elector and his Calvinist court officials drew up plans for mass conversion of the population to the new faith in February 1614, as provided for by the rule of  Cuius regio, eius religio  within the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , there were serious protests, with his wife backing the Lutherans. Resistance was so strong that in 1615, John Sigismund backed down and relinquished all attempts at forcible conversion. Instead, he allowed his subjects to be either Lutheran or Calvinist according to the dictates of their own consciences. Henceforward, Brandenburg-Prussia would be a bi-confessional state.
