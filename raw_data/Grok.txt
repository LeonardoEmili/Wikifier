   Grok  is a  |neologism|Neologism|  coined by American writer  |Robert_A_Heinlein|Robert_A_Heinlein|  for his 1961  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction|  novel  Stranger in a Strange Land . While the  Oxford English Dictionary  summarizes the meaning of grok as to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with and to empathize or communicate sympathetically ; also, to experience enjoyment , Heinleins concept is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that the books major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term . The concept of grok garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the books initial publication. The term and aspects of the underlying concept have become part of communities as diverse as  |polyamory|Polyamory|   and  |computer_science|Computer_Science| .     grok in Stranger in a Strange LandStranger, the word grok was used first without any explicit definition on page 22 and continued to be used without being explicitly defined until page 253 . He notes that this first  |intensional_definition|Intensional_Definition|  is simply to drink , but that this is only a metaphor much as English I see often means the same as I understand . Critics have bridged this absence of explicit definition by citing passages from Stranger that illustrate the term. A selection of these passages follows:                              Robert A. Heinlein originally  |coined|Neologism|  the term grok in his 1961 novel  Stranger in a Strange Land  as a  |Martian|Martian|  word that could not be defined in Earthling terms, but can be associated with various literal meanings such as water , to drink , life , or to live , and had a much more profound figurative meaning that is hard for terrestrial culture to understand because of its assumption of a singular reality.     According to the book, drinking water is a central focus on  |Mars_where_it_is_scarce|Water_On_Mars| . Martians use the merging of their bodies with water as a simple example or symbol of how two entities can combine to create a new reality greater than the sum of its parts. The water becomes part of the drinker, and the drinker part of the water. Both grok each other. Things that once had separate realities become entangled in the same experiences, goals, history, and purpose. Within the book, the statement of  |divine|Divinity| |_immanence|Immanence|  verbalized between the main characters,  |Thou_Art_God|Thou_Art_God|  , is logically derived from the concept inherent in the term grok.     Heinlein describes Martian words as guttural and jarring . Martian speech is described as sounding like a bullfrog fighting a cat . Accordingly, grok is generally pronounced as a guttural gr terminated by a sharp k with very little or no vowel sound .    |William_Tenn|William_Tenn|  suggests Heinlein in creating the word might have been influenced by Tenns very similar concept of griggo, earlier introduced in Tenns story  |Venus_and_the_Seven_Sexes|Venus_And_The_Seven_Sexes|  . In his later afterword to the story, Tenn says Heinlein considered such influence very possible .           Uses of the word in the decades after the 1960s are more concentrated in  |computer_culture|Cyberculture| , such as a 1984 appearance in  InfoWorld  |Jargon_File|Jargon_File| , which describes itself as a Hackers Dictionary and has been published under that name three times, puts grok in a programming context:          The entry existed in the very earliest forms of the Jargon File, dating from the early 1980s. A typical tech usage from the Linux Bible, 2005 characterizes the  |Unix|Unix| |_software_development|Software_Development|  philosophy as one that can make your life a lot simpler once you grok the idea .     The book  Perl Best Practices  defines grok as understanding a portion of computer code in a profound way. It goes on to suggest that to re-grok code is to reload the intricacies of that portion of code into ones memory after some time has passed and all the details of it are no longer remembered. In that sense, to grok means to load everything into memory for immediate use. It is analogous to the way a processor  |caches|Cpu_Cache|  memory for short term use, but the only implication by this reference was that it was something that a human would do.     The main web page for  |cURL|Curl| , an open source tool and programming library, describes the function of cURL as cURL groks URLs .     The book  Cyberia  covers its use in this subculture extensively:          The  |keystroke_logging|Keystroke_Logging|  software used by the NSA for its remote intelligence gathering operations is named GROK.     One of the most powerful parsing filters used in  |ElasticSearch|Elasticsearch|  softwares logstash component is named grok.           |Tom_Wolfe|Tom_Wolfe| , in his book  The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test  , describes a characters thoughts during an  |acid_trip|Psychedelic_Experience|      In his counterculture Volkswagen repair manual, How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive: A Manual of Step-by-Step Procedures for the Compleat Idiot , dropout aerospace engineer  |John_Muir|John_Muir|  instructs prospective used VW buyers to grok the car before buying.      The word was used numerous times by  |Robert_Anton_Wilson|Robert_Anton_Wilson|  in his works  The Illuminatus! Trilogy  and  Schr√∂dingers Cat Trilogy .     The term inspired actress Mayim Bialiks womens lifestyle site,  |Grok_Nation|Grok_Nation| .
