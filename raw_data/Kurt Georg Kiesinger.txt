After the war, he was interned and spent 18 months in the  |Ludwigsburg_camp|Stalag_V_A|  before being released as a case of mistaken identity. Munzinger-Online, s.v.Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Accessed 2010-10-16     During the controversies of 1966, the magazine  Der Spiegel  unearthed a Memorandum dated 7 November 1944 in which two colleagues denounced to  |SS|Schutzstaffel|  chief  |Heinrich_Himmler|Heinrich_Himmler|  a conspiracy including Kiesinger that was allegedly propagating defeatism. They accused Kiesinger specifically of hampering anti-Jewish actions within his department.       Kiesinger joined the Christian Democratic Union in 1946. From 1946 he gave private lessons to law students, and in 1948 he resumed his practice as a lawyer. In 1947 he also became unpaid secretary-general of CDU in  |Württemberg_Hohenzollern|Württemberg_Hohenzollern| .     In the  |federal_election_in_1949|1949_West_German_Federal_Election|  he was elected to the  |Bundestag|Bundestag| . In 1951 he became a member of the CDU executive board. During that time, he became known for his rhetorical brilliance, as well as his in-depth knowledge of foreign affairs. However, despite the recognition he enjoyed within the Christian Democrat parliamentary faction, he was passed over during various cabinet reshuffles. Consequently, he decided to switch from federal to state politics.       Kiesinger became Minister President of the state of  |Baden_Württemberg|Baden_Württemberg|  on 17 December 1958, an office in which he served until 1 December 1966. As Minister President he founded two universities, the  |University_of_Konstanz|University_Of_Konstanz|  and the  |University_of_Ulm|University_Of_Ulm| .          In 1966 following the collapse of the existing  |CDU_CSU|Cdu_Csu| - |FDP|Free_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  coalition, Kiesinger was elected to replace  |Ludwig_Erhard|Ludwig_Erhard|  as Chancellor, heading a new CDU/CSU- |SPD|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  alliance. The government formed by Kiesinger remained in power for nearly three years with the SPD leader  |Willy_Brandt|Willy_Brandt|  as Deputy Federal Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Kiesinger reduced tensions with the Soviet bloc nations establishing diplomatic relations with  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| ,  |Romania|Romania|  and  |Yugoslavia|Socialist_Federal_Republic_Of_Yugoslavia|  but he opposed any major conciliatory moves. A number of progressive reforms were also realised during Kiesingers time as Chancellor. Pension coverage was extended in 1967 via the abolition of the income-ceiling for compulsory membership. In education, student grants were introduced, together with a university building programme, while a constitutional reform of 1969 empowered the federal government to be involved with the Länder in educational planning through joint planning commission. Vocational training legislation was also introduced, while a reorganisation of unemployment insurance promoted retraining schemes, counselling and advice services and job creation places. In addition, under the “Lohnfortzahlunggesetz” of 1969, employers had to pay all employees’ wages for the first 6 weeks of sickness. The Federal Republic of Germany: The End of an era edited by Eva Kolinsky In August 1969,  the Landabgaberente was introduced.      One of his low points as Chancellor was in 1968 when Nazi-hunter  |Beate_Klarsfeld|Beate_Klarsfeld| , who campaigned with her husband  |Serge_Klarsfeld|Serge_Klarsfeld|  against Nazi criminals, publicly slapped him in the face during the 1968 Christian Democrat convention, while calling him a  |Nazi|Nazism| . She did so in French and – whilst being dragged out of the room by two ushers – repeated her words in German saying Kiesinger! Nazi! Abtreten! Kiesinger, holding his left cheek, did not respond. Up to his death he refused to comment on the incident and in other opportunities he denied explicitly that he had been opportunistic by joining the NSDAP in 1933 . During his period as Chancellor, he made  |Carl_Schmitt|Carl_Schmitt|  his regular intellectual companion . Other prominent critics included the writers  |Heinrich_Böll|Heinrich_Böll|  and  |Günter_Grass|Günter_Grass|  .       After the election of 1969, the SPD preferred to form a coalition with the FDP, ending the uninterrupted post-war reign of the CDU chancellors. Kiesinger was succeeded as Chancellor by  |Willy_Brandt|Willy_Brandt| . Kiesinger continued to head the CDU/CSU in opposition until July 1971 and remained a member of the Bundestag until 1980. Of his memoirs only part one  was completed, covering the years up to 1958. He died in  |Tübingen|Tübingen|  on 9 March 1988, four weeks before his 84th birthday. After a  |requiem_mass|Requiem_Mass|  in  |Stuttgarts|Stuttgart|  St. Eberhard Church, his funeral procession was followed by protesters who wanted his former membership in the  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party|  remembered.       1 December 1966 – 21 October 1969  |CDU|Christian_Democratic_Union_Of_Germany| |SPD|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany| CDUCDU |CSU|Christian_Social_Union_Of_Bavaria| SPDSPDCDUCSUSPDSPDCDUSPDCDUSPDCSUCDUSPD |rman_politici|Rman_Politici| SPDCDU CDUCDUSPDCDUSPD .
