Job laments the day of his birth; he would like to die, but even that is denied to him. His three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him. The friends do not waver in their belief that Jobs suffering is a punishment for sin, for God causes no one to suffer innocently, and they advise him to repent and seek Gods mercy. Job responds with scorn: his interlocutors are miserable comforters , . since a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.     Jobs responses represent one of the most radical restatements of Israelite theology in the Hebrew Bible.  He moves away from the pious attitude as shown in the prologue and began to berate God for the disproportionate wrath against him. He sees God as, among others, intrusive and suffocating ; unforgiving and obsessed with destroying a human target ; angry ; fixated on punishment ; and hostile and destructive . He then shifts his focus from the injustice that he himself suffers to Gods governance of the world. He suggests that the wicked have taken advantage of the needy and the helpless, who remain in significant hardship, but God does nothing to punish them .            The dialogues of Job and his friends are followed by a poem on the inaccessibility of wisdom: Where is wisdom to be found? it asks, and concludes that it has been hidden from man . Job contrasts his previous fortune with his present plight, an outcast, mocked and in pain. He protests his innocence, lists the principles he has lived by, and demands that God answer him. ": null

Wisdom means both a way of thinking and a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, as well as the ability to apply it to life. It is attainable in part through human effort and in part as a gift from God, but never in its entirety – except by God. The three books share attitudes and assumptions but differ in their conclusions: Proverbs makes confident statements about the world and its workings that are flatly contradicted by Job and Ecclesiastes. Wisdom literature from Sumeria and Babylonia can be dated to the second millennium BCE. Several texts from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt offer parallels to Job, and while it is impossible to tell whether the author of Job was influenced by any of them, their existence suggests that he was the recipient of a long tradition of reflection on the existence of inexplicable suffering.            Job is an investigation of the problem of divine justice. This problem, known in theology as the ": null
    },
    {
        "problem of evil": "Problem Of Evil"
    },
    {
        ", can be rephrased as a question: Why do the righteous suffer?  The conventional answer in ancient Israel was that God rewards virtue and punishes sin . This assumes a world in which human choices and actions are morally significant, but experience demonstrates that suffering is frequently unmerited.     The biblical concept of righteousness was rooted in the covenant-making God who had ordered creation for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern for the poor and needy . Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy. The Satan raises the question of whether there is such a thing as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all Gods servants.     The book begins with the frame narrative, giving the reader an omniscient Gods eye perspective which introduces Job as a man of exemplary faith and piety, blameless and upright , who fears God and shuns evil . The contrast between the frame and the poetic dialogues and monologues, in which Job never learns of the opening scenes in heaven or of the reason for his suffering, creates a sense of dramatic irony between the divine view of the Adversarys wager, and the human view of Jobs suffering without any reason .     In the poetic dialogues Jobs friends see his suffering and assume he must be guilty, since God is just. Job, knowing he is innocent, concludes that God must be unjust. He retains his piety throughout the story , but makes clear from his first speech that he agrees with his friends that God should and does reward righteousness. Elihu rejects the arguments of both parties: Job is wrong to accuse God of injustice, as God is greater than human beings, and nor are the friends correct; for suffering, far from being a punishment, may rescue the afflicted from their affliction and make them more amenable to revelation – literally, open their ears .     Chapter 28, the Hymn to Wisdom, introduces another theme, divine wisdom. The hymn does not place any emphasis on retributive justice, stressing instead the inaccessibility of wisdom. Wisdom cannot be invented or purchased, it says; God alone knows the meaning of the world, and he grants it only to those who live in reverence before him. God possesses wisdom because he grasps the complexities of the world – a theme which looks forward to Gods speech in chapters 38–41 with its repeated refrain Where were you when...?      When God finally speaks he neither explains the reason for Jobs suffering nor defends his justice. The first speech focuses on his role in maintaining order in the universe: the list of things that God does and Job cannot do demonstrates divine wisdom because order is the heart of wisdom. Job then confesses his lack of wisdom, meaning his lack of understanding of the workings of the cosmos and of the ability to maintain it. The second speech concerns Gods role in controlling ": null

Jobs reply to Gods final speech is longer than his first and more complicated. The usual view is that he admits to being wrong to challenge God and now repents in dust and ashes , but the Hebrew is difficult, and an alternative understanding is that Job says he was wrong to repent and mourn and does not retract any of his arguments. In the concluding part of the frame narrative God restores and increases his prosperity, indicating that the divine policy on retributive justice remains unchanged.            In the ": null
