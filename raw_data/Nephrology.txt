Nephrology  is a  |specialty|Specialty|  of  |medicine|Medicine|  and  |pediatric_medicine|Pediatric_Medicine|  that concerns itself with the  |kidneys|Kidney| : the study of normal  |kidney_function|Renal_Function|  and  |kidney_disease|Kidney_Disease| , the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney disease, from diet and medication to  |renal_replacement_therapy|Renal_Replacement_Therapy|  .     Nephrology also studies  |systemic|Systemic_Disease|  conditions that affect the kidneys, such as  |diabetes|Diabetes|  and  |autoimmune_disease|Autoimmune_Disease| ; and systemic diseases that occur as a result of kidney disease, such as  |renal_osteodystrophy|Renal_Osteodystrophy|  and  |hypertension|Hypertension| . A physician who has undertaken additional training and become certified in nephrology is called a nephrologist.     The term nephrology was first used in about 1960. Before then, the specialty was usually referred to as kidney medicine. https://www.science.org.au/learning/general-audience/history/interviews-australian-scientists/professor-priscilla-kincaid-smith Professor Priscilla Kincaid-Smith, nephrologist,  |Australian_Academy_of_Science|Australian_Academy_Of_Science| , Interview by Dr Max Blythe in 1998.       Nephrology concerns the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases, including  |electrolyte_disturbances|Electrolyte_Disturbance|  and  |hypertension|Hypertension| , and the care of those requiring  |renal_replacement_therapy|Renal_Replacement_Therapy| , including  |dialysis|Dialysis|  and  |renal_transplant|Renal_Transplant|  patients. Many diseases affecting the kidney are systemic disorders not limited to the organ itself, and may require special treatment. Examples include acquired conditions such as systemic vasculitides and  |autoimmune_diseases|Autoimmune_Diseases|  , as well as  |congenital|Congenital_Nephrotic_Syndrome|  or genetic conditions such as  |polycystic_kidney_disease|Polycystic_Kidney_Disease| .     Patients are referred to nephrology specialists after a urinalysis, for various reasons, such as  |acute_kidney_failure|Acute_Kidney_Failure| ,  |chronic_kidney_disease|Chronic_Kidney_Disease| ,  |hematuria|Hematuria| ,  |proteinuria|Proteinuria| ,  |kidney_stones|Kidney_Stone| ,  |hypertension|Hypertension| , and disorders of acid/base or  |electrolytes|Electrolyte| .       A nephrologist is a  |physician|Physician|  who specializes in the care and treatment of kidney disease. Nephrology requires additional training to become an  |expert|Expert|  with advanced skills. Nephrologists may provide care to people without kidney problems and may work in  |general_internal_medicine|General_Medicine| ,  |transplant_medicine|Organ_Transplant| ,  |immunosuppression_management|Immunosuppression| ,  |intensive_care_medicine|Intensive_Care| ,  |clinical_pharmacology|Clinical_Pharmacology| ,  |perioperative_medicine|Perioperative_Medicine| , or pediatric nephrology.     Nephrologists may further sub-specialise in  |dialysis|Dialysis| ,  |kidney_transplantation|Organ_Transplant| ,  |chronic_kidney_disease|Chronic_Kidney_Disease| , cancer-related kidney diseases , procedural nephrology or other non-nephrology areas as described above.     Procedures a nephrologist may perform include native kidney and transplant  |kidney_biopsy|Renal_Biopsy| ,  |dialysis|Dialysis|  access insertion ,  |fistula|Fistula|  management , and .           Nephrology training in Australia and New Zealand typically includes completion of a medical degree ,  |internship|Internship|  , Basic Physician Training , successful completion of the  |Royal_Australasian_College_of_Physicians|Royal_Australasian_College_Of_Physicians|  written and clinical examinations, and Advanced Physician Training in Nephrology . The training pathway is overseen and accredited by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Increasingly, nephrologists may additionally complete of a post-graduate degree  in a nephrology research interest . Finally, all Australian and New Zealand nephrologists participate in career-long professional and personal development through the  |Royal_Australasian_College_of_Physicians|Royal_Australasian_College_Of_Physicians|  and other bodies such as the  and the .       In the United Kingdom, nephrology is a subspecialty of general medicine. A nephrologist has completed medical school, foundation year posts and  |core_medical_training|Core_Medical_Training|  and passed the  |Membership_of_the_Royal_College_of_Physicians|Membership_Of_The_Royal_College_Of_Physicians|  exam before competing for a National Training Number in renal medicine. The typical subspecialty training is five years and leads to a  |Certificate_of_Completion_of_Training|Certificate_Of_Completion_Of_Training|  in both renal medicine and general medicine. Subspecialty trainees often interrupt their clinical training to obtain research degrees .       Nephrology training can be accomplished through one of two routes. The first pathway is through an internal medicine pathway leading to an Internal Medicine/Nephrology specialty, and sometimes known as adult nephrology . The second pathway is through  |Pediatrics|Pediatrics|  leading to a speciality in Pediatric Nephrology. In the  |United_States|United_States| , after  |medical_school|Medical_School|  adult nephrologists complete a three-year  |residency|Residency|  in internal medicine followed by a two-year  |fellowship|Fellowship|  in nephrology. Complementary to an adult nephrologist, a pediatric nephrologist will complete a three-year pediatric residency after medical school or a four-year Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics residency. This is followed by a three-year fellowship in Pediatic Nephrology. Once training is satisfactorily completed, the physician is eligible to take the  |American_Board_of_Internal_Medicine|American_Board_Of_Internal_Medicine|  or  |American_Osteopathic_Board_of_Internal_Medicine|American_Osteopathic_Board_Of_Internal_Medicine|  nephrology examination. Nephrologists must be approved by one of these boards. To be approved, the physician must fulfill the requirements for education and training in nephrology in order to qualify to take the boards examination. If a physician passes the examination, then he or she can become a nephrology specialist. Typically, nephrologists also need two to three years of training in an  |ACGME|Acgme|  or  |AOA|American_Osteopathic_Association|  accredited fellowship in nephrology. Nearly all programs train nephrologists in  |continuous_renal_replacement_therapy|Hemofiltration| ; fewer than half in the United States train in the provision of  |plasmapheresis|Plasmapheresis| .  Only pediatric trained physicians are able to train in pediatric nephrology, and internal medicine trained physicians may enter general nephrology fellowships.        |History|History|  and  |physical_examination|Physical_Examination|  are central to the diagnostic workup in nephrology. The history typically includes the present illness, family history, general medical history, diet, medication use, drug use and occupation. The physical examination typically includes an assessment of volume state, blood pressure, heart, lungs, peripheral arteries, joints, abdomen and  |flank|Latus| .     Examination of the urine  allows a direct assessment for possible kidney problems, which may be suggested by appearance of blood in the urine , protein in the urine , pus cells in the urine  or cancer cells in the urine. A 24-hour urine collection can be used to quantify daily protein loss , urine output,  |creatinine_clearance|Creatinine_Clearance|  or electrolyte handling by the  |renal_tubules|Renal_Tubules| .     Basic blood tests can be used to check the concentration of  |hemoglobin|Hemoglobin| ,  |platelets|Platelets| , sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate,  |urea|Urea| ,  |creatinine|Creatinine| , calcium, magnesium or phosphate in the blood. All of these may be affected by kidney problems. The serum creatinine concentration can be used to estimate the function of the kidney, called the  |creatinine_clearance|Creatinine_Clearance|  or estimated  |glomerular_filtration_rate|Glomerular_Filtration_Rate|  . More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as infections , autoimmune conditions ,  |paraproteinemias|Paraproteinemias|   and metabolic diseases .     Structural abnormalities of the kidneys are identified with imaging tests. These may include  |Medical_ultrasonography_ultrasound|Medical_Ultrasonography| ,  |computed_axial_tomography_|Computed_Axial_Tomography| ,  |scintigraphy|Scintigraphy|  ,  |angiography|Angiography|  or  |magnetic_resonance_imaging_|Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging| .     In certain circumstances, less invasive testing may not provide a certain diagnosis. Where definitive diagnosis is required, a  |biopsy|Biopsy|  of the kidney  may be performed. This typically involves the insertion, under  |local_anaesthetic|Local_Anaesthetic|  and ultrasound or CT guidance, of a  |core_biopsy|Core_Biopsy|  needle into the kidney to obtain a small sample of kidney tissue. The kidney tissue is then examined under a microscope, allowing direct visualization of the changes occurring within the kidney. Additionally, the pathology may also  |stage|Staging|  a problem affecting the kidney, allowing some degree of  |prognostication|Prognosis| . In some circumstances, kidney biopsy will also be used to monitor response to treatment and identify early  |relapse|Relapse| .       Treatments in nephrology can include  |medications|Medications| ,  |blood_products|Blood_Products| , surgical interventions ,  |renal_replacement_therapy|Renal_Replacement_Therapy|   and  |plasma_exchange|Plasma_Exchange| . Kidney problems can have significant impact on quality and length of life, and so psychological support, health education and advanced care planning play key roles in nephrology.      |Chronic_kidney_disease|Chronic_Kidney_Disease|  is typically managed with treatment of causative conditions , avoidance of substances toxic to the kidneys ,  |antihypertensives|Antihypertensives| , diet and weight modification and planning for  |end_stage_kidney_failure|End_Stage_Kidney_Failure| . Impaired kidney function has systemic effects on the body. An  |erythropoetin_stimulating_agent|Erythropoetin|  may be required to ensure adequate production of  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cells| ,  |activated_vitamin_D|Calcitriol|  supplements and  |phosphate_binders|Phosphate_Binders|  may be required to counteract the effects of kidney failure on  |bone_metabolism|Renal_Osteodystrophy| , and blood volume and  |electrolyte_disturbance|Electrolyte_Disturbance|  may need correction.      |Auto_immune|Auto_Immune|  and  |inflammatory|Inflammation|  kidney disease, such as  |vasculitis|Vasculitis|  or  |transplant_rejection|Transplant_Rejection| , may be treated with  |immunosuppression|Immunosuppression| . Commonly used agents are  |prednisone|Prednisone| ,  |mycophenolate|Mycophenolate| ,  |cyclophosphamide|Cyclophosphamide| ,  |ciclosporin|Ciclosporin| ,  |tacrolimus|Tacrolimus| ,  |everolimus|Everolimus| ,  |thymoglobulin|Thymoglobulin|  and  |sirolimus|Sirolimus| . Newer, so-called  |biologic_drugs|Biologic_Medical_Product|  or  |monoclonal_antibodies|Monoclonal_Antibodies| , are also used in these conditions and include  |rituximab|Rituximab| ,  |basiliximab|Basiliximab|  and  |eculizumab|Eculizumab| . Blood products including  |intravenous_immunoglobulin|Intravenous_Immunoglobulin|  and a process known as  |plasma_exchange|Plasma_Exchange|  can also be employed.     When the kidneys are no longer able to sustain the demands of the body, end-stage kidney failure is said to have occurred. Without  |renal_replacement_therapy|Renal_Replacement_Therapy| , death from  |kidney_failure|Kidney_Failure|  will eventually result.  |Dialysis|Dialysis|  is an artificial method of replacing some kidney function to prolong life.  |Renal_transplantation|Renal_Transplantation|  replaces kidney function by inserting into the body a healthier kidney from an  |organ_donor|Organ_Donor|  and inducing  |immunologic_tolerance|Immunologic_Tolerance|  of that organ with  |immunosuppression|Immunosuppression| . At present,  |renal_transplantation|Renal_Transplantation|  is the most effective treatment for end-stage kidney failure although its worldwide availability is limited by lack of availability of donor organs.     Most kidney conditions are  |chronic_conditions|Chronic_Condition|  and so long term followup with a nephrologist is usually necessary.       The worlds first society of nephrology was the French Societe de Pathologie Renale. Its first president was Jean Hamburger, and its first meeting was in Paris in February 1949. In 1959, Hamburger also founded the Société de Néphrologie, as a continuation of the older society. The UKs Renal Association was founded in 1950; the second society of nephrologists. Its first president was Arthur Osman. Its first meeting was on 30 March 1950 in London. The Società di Nefrologia Italiana was founded in 1957 and was the first national society to incorporate the phrase nephrologia into its name.     The word nephrology appeared for the first time in a conference, on 1–4 September 1960 at the Premier Congrès International de Néphrologie in Evian and Geneva, the first meeting of the International Society of Nephrology . The first day was in Geneva and the next three were in Evian, France. The early history of the ISN is described by Robinson and Richet  in 2005 and the later history by Barsoum  in 2011. The ISN is the largest global society representing medical professionals engaged in advancing kidney care worldwide.     In the USA, founded in 1964, the  |National_Kidney_Foundation|National_Kidney_Foundation|  is a national organization representing patients and professionals who treat kidney diseases. Founded in 1966, the  |American_Society_of_Nephrology|American_Society_Of_Nephrology|  is the world’s largest professional society devoted to the study of kidney disease. The  |American_Nephrology_Nurses_Association|American_Nephrology_Nurses_Association|  , founded in 1969, promotes excellence in and appreciation of nephrology nursing to make a positive difference for patients with kidney disease. The  |American_Association_of_Kidney_Patients|American_Association_Of_Kidney_Patients|  is a non-profit, patient-centric group focused on improving the health and well-being of CKD and  |dialysis|Dialysis|  patients. The  |National_Renal_Administrators_Association|National_Renal_Administrators_Association|  , founded in 1977, is a national organization that represents and supports the independent and community-based dialysis providers. The  |American_Kidney_Fund|American_Kidney_Fund|  directly provides financial support to patients in need, as well as participating in health education and prevention efforts. ASDIN is the main organization of interventional nephrologists. Other organizations include CIDA, VASA etc. which deal with dialysis vascular access. The  |Renal_Support_Network|Renal_Support_Network|  is a nonprofit, patient-focused, patient-run organization that provides non-medical services to those affected by chronic kidney disease .     In the United Kingdom, the  |UK_National_Kidney_Federation|Uk_National_Kidney_Federation|  and British Kidney Patient Association  represents patients, and the  |Renal_Association|Renal_Association|  represents renal physicians and works closely with the  |National_Service_Framework|National_Service_Framework| .
