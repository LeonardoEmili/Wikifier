Since a  hadd  punishment for zina requires testimony from four witnesses to the actual act of penetration or a confession from the accused repeated four times, the legal criteria for the prescribed harsh punishments of homosexual acts were very difficult to fulfill. The debates of classical jurists are to a large extent theoretical, since homosexual relations have always been tolerated in pre-modern Islamic societies. While it is difficult to ascertain to what extent the legal sanctions were enforced in different times and places, historical record suggests that the laws were invoked mainly in cases of rape or other exceptionally blatant infringement on public morals . Documented instances of prosecution for homosexual acts are rare, and those which followed legal procedure prescribed by Islamic law are even rarer.          In Kecia Alis book, she cites that contemporary scholars disagree sharply about the Quranic perspective on same-sex intimacy. One scholar represents the conventional perspective by arguing that the Quran is very explicit in its condemnation of homosexuality leaving scarcely any loophole for a theological accommodation of homosexuality in Islam. Another scholar argues that the Quran does not address homosexuality or homosexuals explicitly. Overall, Ali says that there is no one Muslim perspective on anything. Kecia Ali, Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Quran, Hadith and Jurisprudence  , xvi, 103.     Many Muslim scholars have followed a dont ask, dont tell policy in regards to homosexuality in Islam, by treating the subject with passivity.      Mohamed El-Moctar El-Shinqiti, director of the Islamic Center of South Plains in Texas, has argued that homosexuality is a grievous sin... no legal punishment is stated in the Quran for homosexuality... it is not reported that Prophet Muhammad has punished somebody for committing homosexuality... there is no authentic hadith reported from the Prophet prescribing a punishment for the homosexuals...

He acknowledged that while Islamic law iterations prohibits pre- and extra-marital as well as same-sex sexual activity, it does not attempt to regulate feelings, emotions and urges, but only its translation into action that authorities had declared unlawful . Kutty, who teaches comparative law and legal reasoning, also wrote that many Islamic scholars  have even argued that homosexual tendencies themselves were not haram but had to be suppressed for the public good . He claimed that this may not be what the LGBTQ community wants to hear , but that, it reveals that even classical Islamic jurists struggled with this issue and had a more sophisticated attitude than many contemporary Muslims . Kutty, who in the past wrote in support of allowing Islamic principles in dispute resolution, also noted that most Muslims have no problem extending full human rights to those—even Muslims—who live together in sin . He argued that it therefore seems hypocritical to deny fundamental rights to same-sex couples. Moreover, he concurred with Islamic legal scholar Mohamed Fadel  in arguing that this is not about changing Islamic marriage , but about making sure that all citizens have access to the same kinds of public benefits .     Some modern day Muslim scholars, such as Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, argue for a different interpretation of the Lot narrative focusing not on the sexual act but on the infidelity of the tribe and their rejection of Lots Prophethood. According to Kugle, where the Quran treats same-sex acts, it condemns them only so far as they are exploitive or violent. More generally, Kugle notes that the Quran refers to four different levels of personality. One level is genetic inheritance. The Quran refers to this level as ones physical stamp that determines ones temperamental nature including ones sexuality. One the basis of this reading of the Quran, Kugle asserts that homosexuality is caused by divine will, so homosexuals have no rational choice in their internal disposition to be attracted to same-sex mates.  Kugle argues that if the classical commentators had seen sexual orientation as an integral aspect of human personality, they would have read the narrative of Lot and his tribe as addressing male rape of men in particular and not as addressing homosexuality in general. Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, Homosexuality in Islam: Critical Reflection on Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims , 54. Kugle furthermore reads the Quran as holding a positive assessment of diversity. Under this reading, Islam can be described as a religion that positively assesses diversity in creation and in human societies, allowing gay and lesbian Muslims to view homosexuality as representing the natural diversity in sexuality in human societies. Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, Sexuality, diversity and ethics in the agenda of progressive Muslims in Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism, ed. Omid Safi , 194-195. A critique of Kugles approach, interpretations and conclusions was published in 2016 by Mobeen Vaid.      In a 2012 book, Aisha Geissinger  Aisha Geissinger writes that there are apparently irreconcilable Muslim standpoints on same-sex desires and acts, all of which claim interpretative authenticity. One of these standpoints results from queer-friendly interpretations of the Lot story and the Quran. The Lot story is interpreted as condemning rape and inhospitality rather than todays consensual same-sex relationships. Aisha Geissinger, Islam and Discourses of Same-Sex Desire in Queer Religion, Volume 1, eds., Donald L. Boisvert and Jay Emerson Johnson , 70. 83.     In their book Islamic Law and Muslim Same-Sex Unions, Junaid Jahangir and Hussein Abdullatif argue that interpretations which view the Quranic narrative of the people of Lot and the derived classical notion of liwat as applying to same-sex relationships reflect the sociocultural norms and medical knowledge of societies that produced those interpretations. They further argue that the notion of liwat is compatible with the Quranic narrative, but not with the contemporary understanding of same-sex relationships based on love and shared responsibilities.      Abdessamad Dialmy  Abdessamad Dialmy in his 2010 article, Sexuality and Islam, addressed sexual norms defined by the sacred texts . He wrote that sexual standards in Islam are paradoxical. The sacred texts allow and actually are an enticement to the exercise of sexuality. However, they also discriminate . . . between heterosexuality and homosexuality. Islams paradoxical standards result in the current back and forth swing of sexual practices between repression and openness. Dialmy sees a solution to this back and forth swing by a reinterpretation of repressive holy texts. The European Journal of Contraception & Reproductive Health Care .       Societies in Islam have recognized both erotic attraction and sexual behavior between members of the same sex . However, their attitudes about them have often been contradictory: severe religious and legal sanctions against homosexual behavior and at the same time celebratory expressions of erotic attraction.

It was expected that many or most mature men would be sexually attracted to both women and adolescent boys , and men were expected to wish to play only an active role in homosexual intercourse once they reached adulthood. However, any confident assessment of the actual incidence of homosexual behavior remains elusive. Preference for homosexual over heterosexual relations was regarded as a matter of personal taste rather than a marker of homosexual identity in a modern sense. While playing an active role in homosexual relations carried no social stigma beyond that of licentious behavior, seeking to play a passive role was considered both unnatural and shameful for a mature man. Following Greek precedents, the Islamic medical tradition regarded as pathological only this latter case, and showed no concern for other forms of homosexual behavior.        During the early period, growth of a beard was considered to be the conventional age when an adolescent lost his homoerotic appeal, as evidenced by poetic protestations that the author still found his lover beautiful despite the growing beard.

Before that time, Ottoman societal norms accepted homoerotic relations as normal, despite condemnation of homosexuality by religious scholars. The Ottoman Sultanic law  tended to equalize the treatment of hetero- and homosexuals. Dream interpretation literature accepted homosexuality as natural, and  karagoz , the principal character of popular puppet theater, engaged in both active and passive gay sex. However, in the 19th century, Ottoman society started to be influenced by European ideas about sexuality as well as the criticism leveled at the Ottoman society by European authors for its sexual and gender norms, including homosexuality. This criticism associated the weakness of the Ottoman state and corruption of the Ottoman government with Ottoman sexual corruption. By the 1850s, these ideas were prompting embarrassment and self-censorship among the Ottoman public regarding traditional attitudes toward sex in general and homosexuality in particular.

With reference to the Muslim world more broadly, Tilo Beckers writes that the modern rejection and criminalization of homosexuality in Islam gained momentum through the exogenous effects of European colonialism. . . .

Although contemporary Islamist movements decry homosexuality as a form of Western decadence, the current prejudice against it among Muslim publics stems from an amalgamation of traditional Islamic legal theory with popular notions that were imported from Europe during the colonial era, when Western military and economic superiority made Western notions of sexuality particularly influential in the Muslim world.      In some Muslim-majority countries, current anti-LGBT laws were enacted by European colonial powers or Soviet organs and retained following independence.   The 1860 ": null

Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle has argued that, while Muslims commemorate the early days of Islam when they were oppressed as a marginalized few, many of them now forget their history and fail to protect Muslims who are gay, transgender and lesbian. Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle, Living Out Islam: Voices of Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Muslims , 21-22.            While friendship between men and boys is often described in sexual ways in classical Islamic literature, Khaled El-Rouayheb and Oliver Leaman have argued that it would be misleading to conclude from this that homosexuality was widespread in practice. Such literature tended to use transgressive motifs alluding to what is forbidden, in particular homosexuality and wine. Greek homoerotic motifs may have accurately described practices in ancient Greece, but in their Islamic adaptations they tended to play a satirical or metaphorical rather than descriptive role. At the same time, many miniatures, especially from Ottoman Turkey, contain explicit depictions of pederasty, suggesting that the practice enjoyed a certain degree of popularity. A number of pre-modern texts discuss the possibility of sexual exploitation faced by young boys in educational institutions and warn teachers to take precautions against it.     In modern times, despite the formal disapproval of religious authority, the segregation of women in Muslim societies and the strong emphasis on male virility leads adolescent males and unmarried young men to seek sexual outlets with boys younger than themselves—in one study in Morocco, with boys in the age-range 7 to 13.

They believe one has to avoid getting buggered precisely in order not to acquire a taste for it and thus become addicted.  Not all sodomy is homosexual: one Moroccan sociologist, in a study of sex education in his native country, notes that for many young men heterosexual sodomy is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes likewise report the demand for anal penetration from their clients. Dialmy, pp. 32 and 35, footnote 34     In regards to homosexual intercourse, it is the enjoyment that is considered bad, rather than simply the penetration.

The Muslim community as a whole, worldwide, has become polarized on the subject of homosexuality. Some Muslims say that no good Muslim can be gay, and traditional schools of Islamic law consider homosexuality a grave sin.

Especially, it is young Muslims who are increasingly speaking out in support of gay rights .

The Trust suggests that the majority of individuals who are homeless due to religious out casting are either Christian or Muslim.

During March of 2019, British Muslim parents began protesting Parkfield Community School, a town where more than a third of the children are Muslim, due to the school’s implementation of a “No Outsiders” sex-education program. The aim of this program was to provide students with lessons on same-sex relationships. The protest led to the school backing down by no longer following through with the “No Outsider” program. Regardless of this, the school’s minister emphasized that the school tries express equality.               The coming together of human rights discourses and sexual orientation struggles has resulted in an abundance of social movements and organizations concerned with gender and sexual minority oppression and discrimination.

        " sounded a pessimistic note about the future: In my lifetime I do not see Islam drafting a uniform edict that homosexuality is permissible. Following is material from two chapters dealing with the present.     Rusmir Musić in a chapter Queer Visions of Islam said that Queer Muslims struggle daily to reconcile their sexuality and their faith. Musić began to study in college whether or not my love for somebody of the same gender disgusts God and whether it will propel me to hell. The answer, for me, is an unequivocal no. Furthermore, Musić wrote, my research and reflection helped me to imagine my sexuality as a gift from a loving, not hateful, God. Rusmir Musić, Queer Visions of Islam in Islam and Homosexuality, ed. Samar Habib, , pp. 327-328.     Marhuq Fatima Khan in a chapter Queer, American, and Muslim: Cultivating Identities and Communities of Affirmation, says that Queer Muslims employ a few narratives to enable them to reconcile their religious and sexual identities. They fall into three broad categories: God Is Merciful; That Is Just Who I Am; and Its Not Just Islam. Marhuq Fatima Khan, Queer, American, and Muslim: Cultivating Identities and Communities of Affirmation in Islam and Homosexuality, ed. Samar Habib, , 356-358.     Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism,  asserts that Islam does not address homosexuality. In Fugles reading, the Quran holds a positive assessment of diversity. It respects diversity in physical appearance, constitution, stature, and color of human beings as a natural consequence of Divine wisdom in creation. Therefore, Islam can be described as a religion that positively assesses diversity in creation and in human societies. Furthermore, in Kugles reading, the Quran implies that some people are different in their sexual desires than others. Thus, homosexuality can be seen as part of the natural diversity in sexuality in human societies. This is the way gay and lesbian Muslims view their homosexuality.      In addition to the Quran, Kugle refers to the benediction of ": null

    {
        " which says. praise be to God, the marvels of whose creation are not subject to the arrows of accident. For Kugle, this benediction implies that if sexuality is inherent in a persons personality, then sexual diversity is a part of creation, which is never accidental but is always marvelous. Kugle also refers to a rich archive of same-sex sexual desires and expressions, written by or reported about respected members of society: literati, educated elites, and religious scholars. Given these writings, Kugle concludes that one might consider Islamic societies to provide a vivid illustration of a homosexual-friendly environment. This evoked from medieval and early modern Christian Europeans accusations that Muslim were engaging openly in same-sex practices.      Kugle goes a step further in his argument and asserts that if some Muslims find it necessary to deny that sexual diversity is part of the natural created world, then the burden of proof rests on their shoulders to illustrate their denial from the Quranic discourse itself.

Regarding the Quran, Ali says that modern scholars disagree about what it says about same-sex intimacy. Some scholars argue that the Quran does not address homosexuality or homosexuals explicitly. Kecia Ali, Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Quran, Hadith and Jurisprudence  Ts , xvi, 103.     Regarding homosexuality, Ali, says that the belief that exclusively homosexual desire is innate in some individuals has been adopted even among some relatively conservative Western Muslim thinkers. 100 Homosexual Muslims believe their homosexuality to be innate and view their sexual orientation as God-given and immutable. 123 She observes that queer and trans people are sometimes treated as defective or deviant, and she adds that it is vital not to assume that variation implies imperfection or disability. Kecia Ali, Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Quran, Hadith and Jurisprudence  , 100, 123, 206.

Kecia Ali, Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Quran, Hadith and Jurisprudence  , 105-106. Ali states that some scholars claim that Islamic societies were homosexual-friendly in history. , 100.     In an article Same-sex Sexual Activity and Lesbian and Bisexual Women Ali elaborates on homosexuality as an aspect of medieval Muslim culture. She says that same-sex sexual expression has been a more or less recognized aspect of Muslim societies for many centuries. There are many explicit discussions of same-sex sexual activity in medieval Arabic literature.  Accessed October 1, 2016. Ali states there is a lack of focus in medieval tradition on female same-sex sexual activity, where the Quran mainly focuses male/male sex. With female same-sex sexual activity there is more focus on the punishment for the acts and the complications with the dower, compare to men where there is a focus on punishment but also the needs to ablutions and the affect of the act on possible marriage decisions. , 101.
