              Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini  was an Italian  |opera|Opera| |_composer|Composer|  who has been called the greatest composer of Italian opera after  |Verdi|Giuseppe_Verdi|  .     Puccinis early work was rooted in traditional late-19th-century romantic Italian opera. Later, he successfully developed his work in the realistic  verismo  style, of which he became one of the leading exponents.     Puccinis most renowned works are  La bohème  ,  Tosca  ,  Madama Butterfly  , and  Turandot  , all of which are among the  |important_operas|List_Of_Important_Operas|  played as standards.             Puccini was born Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini in  |Lucca|Lucca| , Italy in 1858. He was one of nine children of Michele Puccini and Albina Magi. The Puccini family was established in Lucca as a local musical dynasty by Puccinis great-great-grandfather – also named  |Giacomo|Giacomo_Puccini|  .   This first Giacomo Puccini was maestro di cappella of the Cattedrale di San Martino in Lucca.  He was succeeded in this position by his son, Antonio Puccini, and then by Antonios son  |Domenico|Domenico_Puccini| , and Domenicos son Michele . Each of these men studied music at Bologna, and some took additional musical studies elsewhere. Domenico Puccini studied for a time under  |Giovanni_Paisiello|Giovanni_Paisiello| . Each composed music for the church. In addition, Domenico composed several operas, and Michele composed one opera. Puccinis father Michele enjoyed a reputation throughout northern Italy, and his funeral was an occasion of public mourning, at which the then-famed composer  |Giovanni_Pacini|Giovanni_Pacini|  conducted a Requiem.      With the Puccini family having occupied the position of maestro di cappella for 124 years by the time of Micheles death, it was anticipated that Micheles son Giacomo would occupy that position as well when he was old enough. However, when Michele Puccini died in 1864, his son Giacomo was only six years old, and thus not capable of taking over his fathers job. As a child, he nevertheless participated in the musical life of the  |Cattedrale_di_San_Martino|Lucca_Cathedral| , as a member of the boys choir and later as a substitute organist.     Puccini was given a general education at the seminary of San Michele in Lucca, and then at the seminary of the cathedral. One of Puccinis uncles, Fortunato Magi, supervised his musical education. Puccini got a diploma from the Pacini School of Music in Lucca in 1880, having studied there with his uncle Fortunato, and later with Carlo Angeloni, who had also instructed  |Alfredo_Catalani|Alfredo_Catalani| . A grant from  |Queen_Margherita|Margherita_Of_Savoy| , and assistance from another uncle, Nicholas Cerù, provided the funds necessary for Puccini to continue his studies at the  |Milan_Conservatory|Milan_Conservatory| , where he studied composition with  |Stefano_Ronchetti_Monteviti|Stefano_Ronchetti_Monteviti| ,  |Amilcare_Ponchielli|Amilcare_Ponchielli| , and  |Antonio_Bazzini|Antonio_Bazzini| . Puccini studied at the conservatory for three years, sharing a room with  |Pietro_Mascagni|Pietro_Mascagni| . In 1880, at the age of 21, Puccini composed his  Mass , which marks the culmination of his familys long association with  |church_music|Christian_Music|  in his native Lucca.       Puccini wrote an orchestral piece called the Capriccio sinfonico as a thesis composition for the Milan Conservatory. Puccinis teachers Ponchielli and Bazzini were impressed by the work, and it was performed at a student concert at the conservatory on 14 July 1883, conducted by  |Franco_Faccio|Franco_Faccio| . Puccinis work was favorably reviewed in the Milanese publication Perseveranza, and thus Puccini began to build a reputation as a young composer of promise in Milanese music circles.     Le VilliCapriccio sinfonico, Ponchielli and Puccini discussed the possibility that Puccinis next work might be an opera. Ponchielli invited Puccini to stay at his villa, where Puccini was introduced to another young man named  |Ferdinando_Fontana|Ferdinando_Fontana| . Puccini and Fontana agreed to collaborate on an opera, for which Fontana would provide the  |libretto|Libretto| . The work,  Le Villi , was entered into a competition sponsored by the Sozogno music publishing company in 1883 . Although it did not win, Le Villi was later staged at the  |Teatro_Dal_Verme|Teatro_Dal_Verme| , premiering on 31 May 1884.  |G_Ricordi_Co_|Casa_Ricordi|  music publishers assisted with the premier by printing the libretto without charge. Fellow students from the Milan Conservatory formed a large part of the orchestra. The performance was enough of a success that Casa Ricordi purchased the opera. Revised into a two-act version with an intermezzo between the acts, Le Villi was performed at  |La_Scala|La_Scala|  in Milan, on 24 January 1885. However, Ricordi did not publish the score until 1887, hindering further performance of the work.     Edgar |Giulio_Ricordi|Giulio_Ricordi| , head of  |G_Ricordi_Co_|Casa_Ricordi|  music publishers, was sufficiently impressed with Le Villi and its young composer that he commissioned a second opera, which would result in  Edgar . Work was begun in 1884 when Fontana began working out the scenario for the libretto. Puccini finished primary composition in 1887 and orchestration in 1888.  Edgar premiered at  |La_Scala|La_Scala|  on 21 April 1889 to a lukewarm response. The work was withdrawn for revisions after its third performance. In a Milanese newspaper, Giulio Ricordi published a defense of Puccinis skill as a composer, while criticizing Fontanas libretto. A revised version met with success at the  |Teatro_del_Giglio|Teatro_Del_Giglio|  in Puccinis native Lucca on 5 September 1891. In 1892, further revisions reduced the length of the opera from four acts to three, in a version that was well received in Ferrara and was performed in Turin and in Spain. Puccini made further revisions in 1901 and 1905, but the work never achieved popularity. Without the personal support of Ricordi, Edgar might have cost Puccini his career. Puccini had eloped with his former piano student, the married Elvira Gemignani, and Ricordis associates were willing to turn a blind eye to his life style as long as he was successful. When Edgar failed, they suggested to Ricordi that he should drop Puccini, but Ricordi said that he would stay with him and continued his allowance until his next opera.     Manon Lescaut Manon Lescaut , Puccini announced that he would write his own libretto so that no fool of a librettist  could spoil it. Ricordi persuaded him to accept  |Ruggero_Leoncavallo|Ruggero_Leoncavallo|  as his librettist, but Puccini soon asked Ricordi to remove him from the project. Four other librettists were then involved with the opera, as Puccini constantly changed his mind about the structure of the piece. It was almost by accident that the final two,  |Luigi_Illica|Luigi_Illica|  and  |Giuseppe_Giacosa|Giuseppe_Giacosa| , came together to complete the opera.     Manon Lescaut premiered at the  |Teatro_Regio|Teatro_Regio|  in Turin on 2 February 1893.  By coincidence, Puccinis first enduringly popular opera appeared within a week of the premiere of Verdis last opera,  Falstaff , which was first performed on 9 February 1893. In anticipation of the premiere,  La Stampa  wrote that Puccini was a young man concerning whom great hopes had a real basis . Because of the failure of Edgar, however, a failure of Manon Lescaut could have jeopardized Puccinis future as a composer. Although Giulio Ricordi, head of Casa Ricordi, was supportive of Puccini while Manon Lescaut was still in development, the Casa Ricordi board of directors was considering cutting off Puccinis financial support. Phillips-Matz, p. 64 In any event, Manon Lescaut was Puccinis first and only uncontested triumph, acclaimed by critics and public alike.  After the London premiere in 1894,  |George_Bernard_Shaw|George_Bernard_Shaw|  pronounced: Puccini looks to me more like the heir of Verdi than any of his rivals.      Manon Lescaut was a great success and established Puccinis reputation as the most promising rising composer of his generation, and the most likely successor to Verdi as the leading exponent of the Italian operatic tradition.    Illica and Giacosa returned as librettists for Puccini for his next three operas, probably his greatest successes:  La bohème ,  Tosca  and  Madama Butterfly .            La bohèmeManon Lescaut was  La bohème , a four-act opera based on the 1851 book by  |Henri_Murger|Henri_Murger| ,  La Vie de Bohème . La bohème premiered in  |Turin|Turin|  in 1896, conducted by  |Arturo_Toscanini|Arturo_Toscanini| . Budden p. 494 Within a few years, it had been performed throughout many of the leading opera houses of Europe, including Britain, as well as in the United States.  It was a popular success, and remains one of the most frequently performed operas ever written.     The libretto of the opera, freely adapted from Murgers episodic novel, combines comic elements of the impoverished life of the young protagonists with the tragic aspects, such as the death of the young seamstress Mimí. Puccinis own life as a young man in Milan served as a source of inspiration for elements of the libretto. During his years as a conservatory student and in the years before Manon Lescaut, he experienced poverty similar to that of the bohemians in La bohème, including chronic shortage of necessities like food, clothing and money to pay rent. Although Puccini was granted a small monthly stipend by the Congregation of Charity in Rome , he frequently had to pawn his possessions to cover basic expenses.  Early biographers such as Wakeling Dry and Eugenio Checchi, who were Puccinis contemporaries, drew express parallels between these incidents and particular events in the opera. Checchi cited a diary kept by Puccini while he was still a student, which recorded an occasion in which, as in Act 4 of the opera, a single herring served as a dinner for four people. Puccini himself commented: I lived that Bohème, when there wasnt yet any thought stirring in my brain of seeking the theme of an opera .      Puccinis composition of La bohème was the subject of a public dispute between Puccini and fellow composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo. In early 1893, the two composers discovered that they were both engaged in writing operas based on Murgers work. Leoncavallo had started his work first, and he and his music publisher claimed to have priority on the subject . Puccini responded that he started his own work without having any knowledge of Leoncavallos project, and wrote: Let him compose. I will compose. The audience will decide. Puccinis opera premiered a year before that of Leoncavallo, and has been a perennial audience favorite, while Leoncavallos version quickly faded into obscurity.     ToscaLa bohème was  Tosca  , arguably Puccinis first foray into  verismo , the realistic depiction of many facets of real life including violence. Puccini had been considering an opera on this theme since he saw the play Tosca by  |Victorien_Sardou|Victorien_Sardou|  in 1889, when he wrote to his publisher,  |Giulio_Ricordi|Giulio_Ricordi| , begging him to get Sardous permission for the work to be made into an opera: I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music. Phillips-Matz, pp. 106–07        The music of Tosca employs musical signatures for particular characters and emotions, which have been compared to Wagnerian leitmotivs, and some contemporaries saw Puccini as thereby adopting a new musical style influenced by Wagner. Others viewed the work differently. Rejecting the allegation that Tosca displayed Wagnerian influences, a critic reporting on the 20 February 1900 Torino premiere wrote: I dont think you could find a more Puccinian score than this.        On 25 February 1903, Puccini was seriously injured in a car crash during a nighttime journey on the road from Lucca to Torre del Lago. The car was driven by Puccinis chauffeur and was carrying Puccini, his future wife Elvira, and their son Antonio. It went off the road, fell several metres, and flipped over. Elvira and Antonio were flung from the car and escaped with minor injuries. Puccinis chauffeur, also thrown from the car, suffered a serious fracture of his femur. Puccini was pinned under the vehicle, with a severe fracture of his right leg and with a portion of the car pressing down on his chest. A doctor living near the scene of the crash, together with another person who came to investigate, saved Puccini from the wreckage.  The injury did not heal well, and Puccini remained under treatment for months. During the medical examinations that he underwent it was also found that he was suffering from a form of diabetes. Phillips-Matz p. 123 The accident and its consequences slowed Puccinis completion of his next work, Madama Butterfly.     Madama Butterfly Madama Butterfly , premiered at  |La_Scala|La_Scala|  on 17 February 1904 with  |Rosina_Storchio|Rosina_Storchio|  in the title role. It was initially greeted with great hostility . When Storchios  |kimono|Kimono|  accidentally lifted during the performance, some in the audience started shouting: The butterfly is pregnant and There is the little Toscanini . The latter comment referred to her well publicised affair with  |Arturo_Toscanini|Arturo_Toscanini| .  This version was in two acts; Version 1 .  |G_Ricordi_C_|Casa_Ricordi| |Boosey_Co_|Boosey_Hawkes|  Buenos Aires: Breyer Hermanos. This version was withdrawn after the opening night. See  after its disastrous premiere, Puccini withdrew the opera, revising it for what was virtually a second premiere at Brescia in May 1904 Phillips-Matz p. 146 and performances in Buenos Aires, London, the USA and Paris. In 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version, Version 5, the Standard Version . 1907 G. Ricordi & C.: New York – Milan – Rome – Naples – Palermo – London – Paris – Leipsig – Buenos Ayres – S. Paulo. See  which has become known as the standard version . Today, the standard version of the opera is the version most often performed around the world. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed as well, and has been recorded.           After 1904, Puccinis compositions were less frequent. In 1906 Giacosa died and, in 1909, there was scandal after Puccinis wife, Elvira, falsely accused their maid Doria Manfredi of having an affair with Puccini. Finally, in 1912, the death of Giulio Ricordi, Puccinis editor and publisher, ended a productive period of his career.     La fanciulla del West La fanciulla del West , based on a play by  |David_Belasco|David_Belasco| , in 1910. This was commissioned by, and first performed at, the  |Metropolitan_Opera|Metropolitan_Opera|  in New York on 10 December 1910 with Met stars  |Enrico_Caruso|Enrico_Caruso|  and  |Emmy_Destinn|Emmy_Destinn|  for whom Puccini created the leading roles of Dick Johnson and Minnie. Toscanini, then the musical director of the Met, conducted. Smith, p. 544 This was the first world premiere of an opera at the Met. Randall & Davis, p. 42 The premiere was a great success.  However, the compositional style employed in the opera, with few stand-alone arias, was criticized at the time  . Some contemporaries also criticized the opera for failing to achieve an American tone.   However, the opera has been acclaimed for its incorporation of advanced harmonic language and rhythmic complexity into the Italian operatic form.  In addition, one aria from the opera,  Chella mi creda , has become a staple of compilation albums by operatic tenors. It is said that during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , Italian soldiers sang this aria to maintain their spirits.  The 2008 Italian film, Puccini e la fanciulla , is based on the period of his life when he was composing the opera.     La rondine La rondine , to a libretto by  |Giuseppe_Adami|Giuseppe_Adami|  in 1916 after two years of work, and it was premiered at the  |Grand_Théâtre_de_Monte_Carlo|Opéra_De_Monte_Carlo|  on 27 March 1917. The opera had been originally commissioned by Viennas  |Carltheater|Carltheater| ; however, the outbreak of  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  prevented the premiere from being given there. Moreover, the firm of Ricordi had declined the score of the opera  – Giulio Ricordis son Tito was then in charge and he described the opera as bad  |Lehár|Franz_Lehár|  . Phillips-Matz p. 245 It was taken up by their rival, Lorenzo Sonzogno, who arranged the first performance in neutral  |Monaco|Monaco| . Gavin Plumley, Puccinis Bittersweet Operetta , San Francisco Opera program, Nov/Dec 2007, pp. 30–31 The composer continued to work at revising this, the least known of his mature operas, until his death.     La rondine was initially conceived as an operetta, but Puccini eliminated spoken dialogue, rendering the work closer in form to an opera. A modern reviewer described La rondine as a continuous fabric of lilting waltz tunes, catchy pop-styled melodies, and nostalgic love music, while characterizing the plot as recycling characters and incidents from works like La traviata and Die Fledermaus.      Il tritticoIl tabarro, Suor Angelica, and Gianni Schicchi Il trittico  premiered in New York. This work is composed of three one-act operas, each concerning the concealment of a death: a horrific episode  in the style of the Parisian  |Grand_Guignol|Grand_Guignol| , a sentimental tragedy , and a comedy .     Turandot Turandot , Puccinis final opera, was left unfinished, and the last two scenes were completed by  |Franco_Alfano|Franco_Alfano|  based on the composers sketches. The libretto for Turandot was based on a play of the same name by  |Carlo_Gozzi|Carlo_Gozzi| .  The music of the opera is heavily inflected with  |pentatonic|Pentatonic_Scale|  motifs, intended to produce an Asiatic flavor to the music. Turandot contains a number of memorable stand-alone arias, among them  Nessun dorma .       The libretto of Edgar was a significant factor in the failure of that opera. Thereafter, especially throughout his middle and late career, Puccini was extremely selective, and at times indecisive, in his choice of subject matter for new works. Puccini was deeply involved in the process of writing the libretto itself, requiring many iterative revisions of his libretti in terms of both structure and text. Puccinis relationships with his librettists were at times very difficult. His publisher, Casa Ricordi, was frequently required to mediate disputes and impasses between them. Phillips-Matz     Puccini explored many possible subjects that he ultimately rejected only after a significant amount of effort—such as the creation of a libretto—had been put into them. Phillips-Matz, passim Among the subjects that Puccini seriously considered, but abandoned, were: Cristoforo Sly, Anima Allegra , Two Little Wooden Shoes  , the life of  |Marie_Antoinette|Marie_Antoinette| , Margherita da Cortona, and Conchita . Some of these abandoned subjects were taken up and turned into operas by other composers. For example,  |Franco_Vittadini|Franco_Vittadini|  made an opera of Anima Allegra, Mascagnis opera Lodoletta is derived from Two Little Wooden Shoes, and  |Riccardo_Zandonai|Riccardo_Zandonai|  eventually wrote  Conchita .       From 1891 onwards, Puccini spent most of his time, when not traveling on business, at  |Torre_del_Lago|Torre_Del_Lago| , a small community about fifteen miles from Lucca situated between the Ligurian Sea and  |Lake_Massaciuccoli|Lake_Massaciuccoli| , just south of  |Viareggio|Viareggio| . Torre del Lago was the primary place for Puccini to indulge his love of hunting. I love hunting, I love cars: and for these things, in the isolation of Torre del Lago, I keep the faith.      By 1900, he had acquired land and built a villa on the lake, now known as the Villa Museo Puccini . He lived there until 1921, when pollution produced by peat works on the lake forced him to move to Viareggio, a few kilometres north. After his death, a  |mausoleum|Mausoleum|  was created in the Villa Puccini and the composer is buried there in the chapel, along with his wife and son who died later.     The Villa Museo was owned by his granddaughter,  |Simonetta_Puccini|Simonetta_Puccini| , until her death, and is open to the public. An annual  |Festival_Puccini|Festival_Puccini|  is held at Torre del Lago.            In the autumn of 1884, Puccini began a relationship with a married woman named Elvira Gemignani in Lucca. Elviras husband, Narciso Gemignani, was an unrepentant womanizer , and Elviras marriage was not a happy one. Elvira became pregnant by Puccini, and their son, Antonio , was born in Monza. Elvira left Lucca when the pregnancy began to show, and gave birth elsewhere to avoid gossip. Elvira, Antonio and Elviras daughter by Narciso, Fosca , began to live with Puccini shortly afterwards. Narciso was killed by the husband of a woman that Narciso had an affair with, dying on 26 February 1903, one day after  |Puccinis_car_accident|Automobile_Accident_And_Near_Death| . Only then, in early 1904, were Puccini and Elvira able to marry, and to legitimize Antonio.     The marriage between Puccini and Elvira was also troubled by infidelity, as Puccini had frequent affairs himself, including with well-known singers such as  |Maria_Jeritza|Maria_Jeritza| ,  |Emmy_Destinn|Emmy_Destinn| ,  |Cesira_Ferrani|Cesira_Ferrani| , and  |Hariclea_Darclée|Hariclea_Darclée| . In 1906, while attending the opening of  Madama Butterfly  in Budapest, Puccini fell in love with Blanke Lendvai, the sister of Hungarian composer  |Ervin_Lendvai|Erwin_Lendvai|  . Phillips-Matz, p. 160 Blanke and Puccini exchanged love letters until 1911, when he started an affair with German aristocrat Baroness Josephine van Stangel, which lasted for six years. Phillips-Matz, p. 223     In 1909, Puccinis wife Elvira publicly accused Doria Manfredi, a maid working for the Puccini family, of having an affair with the composer. After being publicly accused of adultery, Doria Manfredi committed suicide. An autopsy determined, however, that Doria had died a virgin, refuting the allegations made against her. Elvira Puccini was prosecuted for slander, and was sentenced to more than five months in prison, although a payment to the Manfredi family by Puccini spared Elvira from having to serve the sentence. Some music critics and interpreters of Puccinis work have speculated that the psychological effects of this incident on Puccini interfered with his ability to complete compositions later in his career, and also influenced the development of his characters such as Liù , a slave girl who dies tragically by suicide.   Weaver, p. 375     According to documents found in the possession of a descendant of the Manfredi family, Nadia Manfredi, in 2007, Puccini was actually having an affair with Giulia Manfredi, Dorias cousin. Press reports at the time when these documents were discovered alleged that Nadia Manfredi was Puccinis granddaughter, by a son, Antonio Manfredi, born to Giulia.         Unlike  |Wagner|Richard_Wagner|  and  |Verdi|Giuseppe_Verdi| , Puccini was not active in politics. Puccini biographer  |Mary_Jane_Phillips_Matz|Mary_Jane_Phillips_Matz|  wrote: Throughout this entire period Puccinis interest in politics was close to zero, as it had been all his life, so far as one can judge. He seemed almost indifferent to everything from mayoral elections in Viareggio to cabinet appointments in Rome. Another biographer speculates that Puccini may have been—if he had a political philosophy—a monarchist.      Puccinis indifference to politics caused him problems during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| . Puccinis long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization. Puccini was also criticized during the war for his work on La rondine under a 1913 commission contract with an Austrian theater after Italy and Austria-Hungary became opponents in the war in 1914 . Puccini did not participate in the public war effort, but privately rendered assistance to individuals and families affected by the war.     In 1919, Puccini was commissioned to write music to an ode by  honoring Italys victories in World War I. The work, Inno a Roma , was to premiere on 21 April 1919, during a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of Rome. The premiere was delayed to 1 June 1919, when it was played at the opening of a gymnastics competition. Weaver, p. 301 Although not written for the fascists, Inno a Roma was widely played during Fascist street parades and public ceremonies.   prepared by San Francisco Opera Company     Puccini had some contact with  |Benito_Mussolini|Benito_Mussolini|  and the  |Italian_Fascist_Party|National_Fascist_Party|  in the year preceding his death. In 1923 the Fascist Party in Viareggio made Puccini an honorary member and sent him a membership card. However, evidence that Puccini was actually a member of the Fascist party is ambiguous. Wilson , 192 The Italian Senate has traditionally included a small number of members appointed in recognition of their cultural contributions to the nation. Puccini hoped to attain this honor, which had been granted to Verdi, and undertook to use his connections to bring about the appointment. While honorary senators could vote, there is no indication that Puccini sought the appointment for this purpose. Puccini also wished to establish a national theater in Viareggio, a project which would require government support. Puccini met with Mussolini twice, in November and December 1923, seeking support for the theater project. While the theater project never came to fruition, Puccini was named Senator  a few months before his death.     At the time Puccini met with Mussolini, Mussolini had been prime minister for approximately a year, but his party had not yet taken full control of the Italian Parliament through the violence and irregularities of the  |1924_general_election|Italian_General_Election_1924| . Puccini was no longer alive when Mussolini announced the end of representative government, and the beginning of a fascist dictatorship, in his speech before the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1925.          A  |chain_smoker|Chain_Smoking|  of  |Toscano_cigars|Toscano|  and cigarettes, Puccini began to complain of chronic sore throats towards the end of 1923. A diagnosis of  |throat_cancer|Head_And_Neck_Cancer|  led his doctors to recommend a new and experimental  |radiation_therapy|Radiation_Therapy|  treatment, which was being offered in  |Brussels|Brussels| . Puccini and his wife never knew how serious the cancer was, as the news was revealed only to his son.     Puccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, aged 65, from complications after the treatment; uncontrolled bleeding led to a  |heart_attack|Myocardial_Infarction|  the day after surgery. News of his death reached Rome during a performance of La bohème. The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played  |Chopins|Frédéric_Chopin| |_Funeral_March|Piano_Sonata_No_2|  for the stunned audience.  He was buried in  |Milan|Milan| , in Toscaninis family tomb, but that was always intended as a temporary measure. In 1926 his son arranged for the transfer of his fathers remains to a specially created chapel inside the Puccini villa at Torre del Lago.       Most broadly, Puccini wrote in the style of the late-Romantic period of classical music .  Music historians also refer to Puccini as a component of the  giovane scuola  , a cohort of composers who came onto the Italian operatic scene as Verdis career came to an end, such as Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and others mentioned below. Puccini is also frequently referred to as a  verismo  composer.      Puccinis career extended from the end of the Romantic period into the modern period. He consciously attempted to update his style to keep pace with new trends, but did not attempt to fully adopt a modern style. One critic, Anthony Davis has stated: Loyalty toward nineteenth-century Italian-opera traditions and, more generally, toward the musical language of his Tuscan heritage is one of the clearest features of Puccinis music. Davis also identifies, however, a stylistic pluralism in Puccinis work, including influences from the German symphonic tradition, French harmonic and orchestrational traditions, and, to a lesser extent, aspects of Wagnerian chromaticism . In addition, Puccini frequently sought to introduce music or sounds from outside sources into his operas, such as his use of Chinese folk melodies in Turandot.     All of Puccinis operas have at least one set piece for a lead singer that is separate enough from its surroundings that it can be treated as a distinct aria, and most of his works have several of these. At the same time, Puccinis work continued the trend away from operas constructed from a series of set pieces, and instead used a more through-composed or integrated construction. His works are strongly melodic. In orchestration, Puccini frequently doubled the vocal line in unison or at octaves in order to emphasize and strengthen the melodic line.     Verismo is a style of Italian opera that began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagnis Cavalleria rusticana, peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s. Verismo in Stanley Sadie The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians, London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19, p. 670,  The style is distinguished by realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of everyday life, especially the life of the contemporary lower classes. It by and large rejects the historical or mythical subjects associated with  |Romanticism|Romanticism| . Cavalleria rusticana, Pagliacci, and Andrea Chénier are uniformly considered to be verismo operas. Puccinis career as a composer is almost entirely coincident in time with the verismo movement. Only his Le Villi and Edgar preceded Cavalleria rusticana. Some view Puccini as essentially a verismo composer, while others, although acknowledging that he took part in the movement to some degree, do not view him as a pure verismo composer.  In addition, critics differ as to the degree to which particular operas by Puccini are, or are not, properly described as verismo operas. Two of Puccinis operas, Tosca and Il tabarro, are universally considered to be verismo operas.  Puccini scholar  |Mosco_Carner|Mosco_Carner|  places only two of Puccinis operas other than Tosca and Il tabarro within the verismo school: Madama Butterfly, and La fanciulla del West.  Because only three verismo works  by Puccini continue to appear regularly on stage , Puccinis contribution has had lasting significance to the genre.     Both during his lifetime and in posterity, Puccinis success outstripped other Italian opera composers of his time, and he has been matched in this regard by only a handful of composers in the entire history of opera. Between 2004 and 2018, Puccini ranked third in the number of performances of his operas worldwide, as surveyed by  |Operabase|Operabase| . Three of his operas  were amongst the 10 most frequently performed operas worldwide.       |Gustav_Kobbé|Gustav_Kobbé| , the original author of The Complete Opera Book, a standard reference work on opera, wrote in the 1919 edition: Puccini is considered the most important figure in operatic Italy today, the successor of Verdi, if there is any.  Other contemporaries shared this view. Italian opera composers of the generation with whom Puccini was compared included  |Pietro_Mascagni|Pietro_Mascagni|  ,  |Ruggero_Leoncavallo|Ruggero_Leoncavallo|  ,  |Umberto_Giordano|Umberto_Giordano|  ,  |Francesco_Cilea|Francesco_Cilea|  , Baron  |Pierantonio_Tasca|Pierantonio_Tasca|  ,  |Gaetano_Coronaro|Gaetano_Coronaro|  , and  |Alberto_Franchetti|Alberto_Franchetti|  .  Only three composers, and three works, by Italian contemporaries of Puccini appear on the Operabase list of most-performed works:  Cavalleria rusticana  by Mascagni,  Pagliacci  by Ruggero Leoncavallo, and  Andrea Chénier  by Umberto Giordano. Kobbé contrasted Puccinis ability to achieve sustained success with the failure of Mascagni and Leoncavallo to produce more than merely one sensationally successful short opera . By the time of Puccinis death in 1924, he had earned $4  million from his works.      Although the popular success of Puccinis work is undeniable, and his mastery of the craft of composition has been consistently recognized, opinion among critics as to the artistic value of his work has always been divided.  |Grove_Music_Online|Grove_Music_Online|  described Puccinis strengths as a composer as follows:   Puccini succeeded in mastering the orchestra as no other Italian had done before him, creating new forms by manipulating structures inherited from the great Italian tradition, loading them with bold harmonic progressions which had little or nothing to do with what was happening then in Italy, though they were in step with the work of French, Austrian and German colleagues.     In his work on Puccini,  |Julian_Budden|Julian_Budden|  describes Puccini as a gifted and original composer, noting the innovation hidden in the popularity of works such as  |Che_gelida_manina|Che_Gelida_Manina|  . He describes the aria in musical terms , and points out that its structure was rather unheard of at the time, having three distinct musical paragraphs that nonetheless form a complete and coherent whole.  This gumption in musical experimentation was the essence of Puccinis style, as evidenced in his diverse settings and use of the  |motif|Motif|  to express ideas beyond those in the story and text.     Puccini has, however, consistently been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult.  Some have explicitly condemned his efforts to please his audience, such as this contemporary Italian critic:   He willingly stops himself at minor genius, stroking the taste of the public ... obstinately shunning too-daring innovation ... A little heroism, but not taken to great heights; a little bit of veristic comedy, but brief; a lot of sentiment and romantic idyll: this is the recipe in which he finds happiness.       Budden attempted to explain the paradox of Puccinis immense popular success and technical mastery on the one hand, and the relative disregard in which his work has been held by academics:   No composer communicates more directly with an audience than Puccini. Indeed, for many years he has remained a victim of his own popularity; hence the resistance to his music in academic circles. Be it remembered, however, that Verdis melodies were once dismissed as barrel-organ fodder. The truth is that music that appeals immediately to a public becomes subject to bad imitation, which can cast a murky shadow over the original. So long as counterfeit Puccinian melody dominated the world of sentimental operetta, many found it difficult to come to terms with the genuine article. Now that the current coin of light music has changed, the composer admired by Schoenberg, Ravel, and Stravinsky can be seen to emerge in his full stature.             Puccini wrote orchestral pieces, sacred music, chamber music, solo music for piano and organ and songs for voice and piano, most notably his 1880 mass  Messa di gloria , his Preludio Sinfonico of 1882, and his 1890 string quartet movement Crisantemi. However, he is primarily known for his operas:    Le Villi , libretto by  |Ferdinando_Fontana|Ferdinando_Fontana|      Edgar , libretto by Ferdinando Fontana     Manon Lescaut , libretto by  |Luigi_Illica|Luigi_Illica| , Marco Praga and Domenico Oliva     La bohème , libretto by Luigi Illica and  |Giuseppe_Giacosa|Giuseppe_Giacosa|     Tosca , libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa     Madama Butterfly , libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa    La fanciulla del West , libretto by Guelfo Civinini and Carlo Zangarini     La rondine , libretto by  |Giuseppe_Adami|Giuseppe_Adami|      Il trittico     Il tabarro , libretto by Giuseppe Adami    Suor Angelica , libretto by  |Giovacchino_Forzano|Giovacchino_Forzano|   Gianni Schicchi , libretto by Giovacchino Forzano    Turandot , libretto by  |Renato_Simoni|Renato_Simoni|  and  |Giuseppe_Adami|Giuseppe_Adami|         Founded in 1996 in Lucca, the Centro di studi Giacomo Puccini embraces a wide range of approaches to the study of Puccinis work. In the USA, the American Center for Puccini Studies specializes in the presentation of unusual performing editions of composers works and introduces neglected or unknown Puccini pieces. It was founded in 2004 by the singer and director Harry Dunstan.
