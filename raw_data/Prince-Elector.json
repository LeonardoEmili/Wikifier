Fürst  is German for prince, but while the German language distinguishes between the head of a principality  and the son of a monarch , English uses prince for both concepts. Fürst itself is related to English first and is thus the foremost person in his realm. Note that prince derives from Latin princeps, which carried the same meaning.       Electors were reichsstände , enjoying precedence over the other princes. They were, until the 18th century, exclusively entitled to be addressed with the title Durchlaucht . In 1742, the electors became entitled to the superlative Durchläuchtigste , while other princes were promoted to Durchlaucht.

The Elector of Bavaria replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, but when the latter was granted a new electorate in 1648, there was a dispute between the two as to which was vicar. In 1659, both purported to act as vicar, but the other vicar recognised the Elector of Bavaria.

The deliberations were held at the city hall, but voting occurred in the cathedral. In Frankfurt, a special electoral chapel, or Wahlkapelle, was used for elections. Under the Golden Bull, a majority of electors sufficed to elect a king, and each elector could cast only one vote. Electors were free to vote for whomsoever they pleased , but dynastic considerations played a great part in the choice. Electors drafted a  Wahlkapitulation , or electoral capitulation, which was presented to the king-elect. The capitulation may be described as a contract between the princes and the king, the latter conceding rights and powers to the electors and other princes. Once an individual swore to abide by the electoral capitulation, he assumed the office of King of the Romans.
