         An electronic calculator is typically a portable  |electronic|Electronics|  device used to perform  |calculations|Calculation| , ranging from basic  |arithmetic|Arithmetic|  to complex  |mathematics|Mathematics| .     The first  |solid_state_electronic|Solid_State_Electronics|  calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the  |Intel_4004|Intel_4004| , the first  |microprocessor|Microprocessor| , was developed by  |Intel|Intel|  for the Japanese calculator company  |Busicom|Busicom| . They later became used commonly within the  |petroleum_industry|Petroleum_Industry|  .     Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away,  |credit_card_sized|Iso_Iec_7810|  models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of  |integrated_circuits|Integrated_Circuit|  reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.     Computer  |operating_systems|Operating_System|  as far back as  |early_Unix|Ancient_Unix|  have included interactive calculator  |programs|Computer_Program|  such as  |dc|Dc|  and  |hoc|Hoc| , and calculator functions are included in almost all  |personal_digital_assistant|Personal_Digital_Assistant|  type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.     In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are  |scientific_calculators|Scientific_Calculator|  which include  |trigonometric|Trigonometry|  and  |statistical|Statistics|  calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do  |computer_algebra|Computer_Algebra| .  |Graphing_calculators|Graphing_Calculator|  can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space| . , basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.     In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the worlds general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.  , Martin Hilbert and Priscila López ,  |Science|Science| , 332, 60–65; see also                 |Electronic|Electronics|  calculators contain a  |keyboard|Computer_Keyboard|  with  |buttons|Push_Button|  for  |digits|Numerical_Digit|  and  |arithmetic|Arithmetic| al operations; some even contain 00 and 000 buttons to make larger or smaller  |numbers|Number|  easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with  |key_combinations|Key_Combination| .       Calculators usually have  |liquid_crystal_displays|Liquid_Crystal_Display|  as output in place of historical  |light_emitting_diode|Light_Emitting_Diode|  displays and  |vacuum_fluorescent_displays|Vacuum_Fluorescent_Display|  ; details are provided in the section  Technical improvements .     Large-sized  |figures|Number|  are often used to improve readability; while using  |decimal_separator|Decimal_Separator|   instead of or in addition to  |vulgar_fractions|Vulgar_Fraction| . Various symbols for  |function_commands|Command|  may also be shown on the display.  |Fractions|Fraction|  such as  are displayed as decimal  |approximations|Approximation| , for example rounded to . Also, some fractions  can be difficult to recognize in  |decimal|Decimal|  form; as a result, many  |scientific|Scientific_Calculator|  calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or  |mixed_numbers|Mixed_Number| .       Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into  |computer_memory|Computer_Memory| . Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in  |variables|Variable| . The variables can also be used for constructing  |formulas|Formula| . Some models have the ability to extend  |memory|Computer_Memory|  capacity to store more numbers; the extended  |memory_address|Memory_Address|  is termed an  |array|Array_Data_Structure|  index.       Power sources of calculators are:  |batteries|Electric_Battery| ,  |solar_cells|Solar_Cell|  or  |mains_electricity|Mains_Electricity|  , turning on with a  |switch|Switch|  or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off .  |Crank|Crank| -powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.       The following keys are common to most pocket calculators. While the arrangement of the digits is standard, the positions of other keys vary from model to model; the illustration is an example.                  In general, a basic  |electronic|Electronics|  calculator consists of the following components: John Lewis, The Pocket Calculator Book.     Power source     |Keypad|Keypad|  – consists of keys used to input numbers and function commands    Display panel – displays input numbers, commands and results.  |Liquid_crystal_displays|Liquid_Crystal_Display|  ,  |vacuum_fluorescent_displays|Vacuum_Fluorescent_Display|  , and  |light_emitting_diode|Light_Emitting_Diode|  displays use  |seven_segments|Seven_Segment_Display|  to represent each  |digit|Numerical_Digit|  in a basic calculator. Advanced calculators may use  |dot_matrix|Dot_Matrix|  displays.   A printing calculator, in addition to a display panel, has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper, using a printing mechanism.   Processor  |chip|Chipset|  .           |Clock_rate|Clock_Rate|  of a processor  |chip|Chipset|  refers to the frequency at which the  |central_processing_unit|Central_Processing_Unit|  is running. It is used as an indicator of the processors speed, and is measured in clock cycles per second or the  |SI|International_System_Of_Units|  unit  |hertz_|Hertz| . For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred  |hertz|Hertz|  to the  |kilohertz|Kilohertz|  range.          A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:     To perform the calculation , one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators:         .     : When    is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;   : Next, when the  key is pressed, the  |addition|Addition|  instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or the  |status_register|Status_Register| ;   : The second number  is encoded and sent to the X register. This pushes the first number out into the Y register;   : When the  key is pressed, a message from the flag or  |status_register|Status_Register|  tells the permanent or  |non_volatile_memory|Non_Volatile_Memory|  that the operation to be done is  |addition|Addition|  ;   : The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the  |ALU|Arithmetic_Logic_Unit|  and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non-volatile memory;   : The answer, 34 is sent back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the  |binary_decoder|Binary_Decoder|  unit into a decimal number , and then shown on the display panel.     Other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions.            Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD rather than a  |floating_point_representation|Floating_Point_Representation| . BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical  |seven_segment_displays|Seven_Segment_Display|  to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary.     The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.       Where calculators have added functions , software  |algorithms|Algorithm|  are required to produce high precision results. Sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator  |chip|Chipset| , with acceptable calculation time.           The fundamental difference between a calculator and  |computer|Computer|  is that a computer can be  |programmed|Computer_Programming|  in a way that allows the  |program|Computer_Program|  to take different  |branches_according_to_intermediate_results|Branch_On_Condition| , while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions  built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as  |programmable_calculators|Programmable_Calculator|  have  |programming|Computer_Programming|  functions, sometimes with support for  |programming_languages|Programming_Language|  .     For instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement  |floating_point|Floating_Point|  mathematics with code in  |read_only_memory|Read_Only_Memory|  , and compute  |trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Function|  with the  |CORDIC|Cordic|  algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication.  |Bit_serial|Serial_Communication|  logic designs are more common in calculators whereas  |bit_parallel|Parallel_Communication|  designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes  |chip|Chipset|  complexity, but takes many more  |clock_cycles|Clock_Signal| . This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the  |Z80|Zilog_Z80| ,  |MC68000|Motorola_68000| , and  |ARM|Arm_Architecture|  architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.                   The first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones , pebbles, and  |counting_boards|Counting_Board| , and the  |abacus|Abacus| , known to have been used by  |Sumer|Sumer| ians and  |Egyptians|Ancient_Egypt|  before 2000  BC.  Except for the  |Antikythera_mechanism|Antikythera_Mechanism|  , development of computing tools arrived near the start of the 17th century: the  |geometric_military_compass|Sector|  ,  |logarithms|Logarithm|  and  |Napier_bones|Napier_Bones|  , and the  |slide_rule|Slide_Rule|  .        In 1642, the  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  saw the invention of the  |mechanical_calculator|Mechanical_Calculator|  , a device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four  |arithmetic|Arithmetic|  operations with minimal human intervention. Pascal and Leibnitz, in the seventeenth century, and Diderot at a later period, endeavored to construct a machine which might serve as a substitute for human intelligence in the combination of figures    |Pascals_calculator|Pascals_Calculator|  could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickards machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation.  Schickard and Pascal were followed by  |Gottfried_Leibniz|Gottfried_Leibniz|  who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the  |stepped_reckoner|Stepped_Reckoner| , inventing in the process his  |leibniz_wheel|Leibniz_Wheel| , but who couldnt design a fully operational machine. In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry  There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century. see  |Mechanical_calculatorCalculating_clocks_unsuccessful_mechanical_calculators|Mechanical_Calculatorcalculating_Clocks_Unsuccessful_Mechanical_Calculators|         The 18th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first by  |Poleni|Giovanni_Poleni|  with the first fully functional calculating clock and four-operation machine, but these machines were almost always one of the kind.  |Luigi_Torchi|Luigi_Torchi|  invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834: this was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White . Denis Roegel:  In: IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, October–December 2016, pp. 92-93. Retrieved 2018-05-06. It was not until the 19th century and the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  that real developments began to occur. Although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the 19th century, the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible. The  |Arithmometer|Arithmometer| , invented in 1820 as a four-operation mechanical calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later, by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold  plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers and Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100  |comptometers|Comptometer| .       It wasnt until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine, developed by James L. Dalton in the  |United_States|United_States| .     In 1921,  |Edith_Clarke|Edith_Clarke|  invented the Clarke calculator , a simple graph-based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions. This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for  |inductance|Inductance|  and  |capacitance|Capacitance|  in  |power_transmission_lines|Power_Transmission_Lines| .      The  |Curta|Curta|  calculator was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its portability. This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.       The first  |mainframe|Mainframe_Computer|  computers, using firstly  |vacuum_tubes|Vacuum_Tube|  and later  |transistors|Transistor|  in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. This technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators.     The  |Casio|Casio|  Computer Company, in  |Japan|Japan| , released the Model 14-A calculator in 1957, which was the worlds first all-electric compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on  |relay|Relay|  technology, and was built into a desk.        In October 1961, the worlds first all-electronic desktop calculator, the British  |Bell_Punch|Bell_Punch| /Sumlock Comptometer  |ANITA|Sumlock_Anita_Calculator|   was announced. Simple and Silent , Office Magazine, December 1961, p1244 Anita der erste tragbare elektonische Rechenautomat Büromaschinen Mechaniker, November 1961, p207 This machine used  |vacuum_tubes|Vacuum_Tube| , cold-cathode tubes and  |Dekatrons|Dekatron|  in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode  |_Nixie_|Nixie_Tube|  tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical  |comptometers|Comptometer|  of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later  |Sharp|Sharp_Corporation|  CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly  due to its large tube system.  Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names Plus and Sumlock , and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British  |Pilot_ACE|Pilot_Ace|  computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.     The tube technology of the ANITA was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured  |Friden|Friden_Inc_|  EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a   |cathode_ray_tube|Cathode_Ray_Tube|  , and introduced  |Reverse_Polish_Notation|Reverse_Polish_Notation|  to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced:  |Sharp|Sharp_Corporation|  introduced the  |CS_10A|Cs_10A| , which weighed  and cost 500,000 yen , and  |Industria_Macchine_Elettroniche|Industria_Macchine_Elettroniche|  of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it .          There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including  |Canon|Canon_Inc_| ,  |Mathatronics|Mathatronics| ,  |Olivetti|Olivetti| ,  |SCM|Scm_Corporation|  ,  |Sony|Sony| ,  |Toshiba|Toshiba| , and  |Wang|Wang_Laboratories| . The early calculators used hundreds of  |germanium_transistors|Bipolar_Junction_Transistorgermanium_Transistors| , which were cheaper than  |silicon_transistors|Transistorsemiconductor_Material| , on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were  |CRT|Cathode_Ray_Tube| , cold-cathode  |Nixie_tubes|Nixie_Tube| , and  |filament_lamps|Filament_Lamp| . Memory technology was usually based on the  |delay_line_memory|Delay_Line_Memory|  or the  |magnetic_core_memory|Magnetic_Core_Memory| , though the Toshiba Toscal BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of  |dynamic_RAM|Dynamic_Ram|  built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.     The  |Olivetti|Olivetti| |_Programma_101|Programma_101|  was introduced in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company . The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.        Another calculator introduced in 1965 was  |Bulgarias|Peoples_Republic_Of_Bulgaria| |_ELKA_6521|Elkaelka_6521| ,  , Clockwiser. Retrieved Oct 2013.  . Retrieved October 2013. developed by the Central Institute for Calculation Technologies and built at the Elektronika factory in  |Sofia|Sofia| . The name derives from ELektronen KAlkulator, and it weighed around . It is the first calculator in the world which includes the  |square_root|Square_Root|  function. Later that same year were released the  |ELKA_22|Elka_22|   . Retrieved Oct 2013.  ,  . Retrieved Oct 2013. and the ELKA 25, with an in-built printer. Several other models were developed until the first pocket model, the  |ELKA_101|Elka_101| , was released in 1974. The writing on it was in  |Roman_script|Roman_Script| , and it was exported to western countries.  ,  , Clockwiser. Retrieved Oct 2013. , Vintage Calculators. Retrieved Oct 2013.     The  |Monroe_Epic|Monroe_Epic|  programmable calculator came on the market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any conditional branch logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.     The first handheld calculator was a prototype called Cal Tech , whose development was led by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1967. It could add, multiply, subtract, and divide, and its output device was a paper tape. Texas Instruments press release, 15 August 2002. All Things Considered, NPR, 30 September 2007. Audio interview with one of the inventors.         The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistor s on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer integrated circuit s and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of semiconductor development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: Canon Inc. with Texas Instruments , Hayakawa Electric with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics , Busicom with Mostek and Intel , and General Instrument with Sanyo .           By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the Sanyo ICC-0081 Mini Calculator , the Canon Pocketronic, and the Sharp QT-8B micro Compet . The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the Cal-Tech project which had been started at Texas Instruments in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the Cal-Tech project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.     Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the Sharp EL-8 , also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds , had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable NiCad batteries, and initially sold for US $395.     However, integrated circuit development efforts culminated in early 1971 with the introduction of the first calculator on a chip , the MK6010 by Mostek , Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line , Electronics, February 1, 1971, p19 followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology , led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.     In 1971 Pico Electronics . and General Instrument also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.     The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the Busicom LE-120A HANDY , which was marketed early in 1971. The one-chip calculator is here, and its only the beginning , Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34. Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an LED display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit , the Mostek MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries. Using four AA-size cells the LE-120A measures .     The first European-made pocket-sized calculator, DB 800 is made in May 1971 by Digitron in Buje , Croatia with four functions and an eight-digit display and special characters for a negative number and a warning that the calculation has too many digits to display.     The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B , measuring , came out in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red LED display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function Sinclair Executive became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring and weighing . It retailed for around £79 . By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than £5 .     The first Soviet Union made pocket-sized calculator, the Elektronika B3-04 was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the start of 1974.     One of the first low-cost calculators was the Sinclair Cambridge , launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 , or £5 less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of transcendental function s. Ken Shirriff, 2013. See in particular the section Limited performance and accuracy . For more coverage of Shirriffs results, see     Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard had been developing a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule . The $395 HP-35 , along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used reverse Polish notation , also called postfix notation. A calculation like 8 plus 5 is, using RPN, performed by pressing , , , and ; instead of the algebraic infix notation : , , , . It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.     The first Soviet scientific pocket-sized calculator the B3-18 was completed by the end of 1975.     In 1973, Texas Instruments introduced the SR-10 ,  an algebraic entry programmable calculators were produced in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio . These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the HP-65 , in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced  |continuous_memory|Continuous_Memory| , i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first  |alphanumeric|Alphanumeric| , programmable, expandable calculator, the HP-41 C. It could be expanded with random access memory and read-only memory modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printer s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces .     The first Soviet programmable desktop calculator ISKRA 123 , powered by the power grid, was released at the start of the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika  |B3_21|B3_21| , was developed by the end of 1976 and released at the start of 1977. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasnt backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation . Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities , people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure game s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator was used in Soviet spacecraft program as a backup of the board computer.     This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to synthetic programming of the American HP-41 , which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine  |Nauka_i_Zhizn|Nauka_I_Zhizn|  , featured special columns, dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, named yeggogology . The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word YEGGOG which, unsurprisingly, is translated to Error .     A similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the HP-41 , which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than B3-34 .       thu   Through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent display s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal display s were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A HANDY  calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 , Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.     A more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by Sharp Inc with the Sharp EL-805, which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharps Calculator On Substrate technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.     thu   In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, twisted nematic LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.     There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first calculator on a chip integrated circuit s in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs, especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.     The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of CMOS technology. Appearing in the Sharp EL-801 in 1972, the transistor s in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The LED and VFD displays often required added driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.     With this low power consumption came the possibility of using solar cell s as the power source, realised around 1978 by calculators such as the Royal Solar 1, Sharp EL-8026, and Teal Photon  .
