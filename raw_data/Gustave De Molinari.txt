Born in  |Liège|Liège| ,  |Wallonia|Wallonia| , Molinaris critique of the  |state|Sovereign_State|  sometimes resulted in him opposing causes and events which might seemingly be aligned with his overall critique of  |power|Power|  and  |privilege|Privilege| . An example of this was the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  which Molinari believed to be far more about the trade interests of Northern industrialists than about  |slavery|Slavery_In_The_United_States| , although he did not deny that  |abolitionism|Abolitionism_In_The_United_States|  was a part of the picture.     According to  |Ralph_Raico|Ralph_Raico| , Molinari never relented in his last work published a year before his death in 1912, writing: The American Civil War had not been simply a humanitarian crusade to free the slaves. The war ruined the conquered provinces, but the Northern plutocrats pulling the strings achieved their aim: the imposition of a vicious protectionism that led ultimately to the regime of trusts and produced the billionaires.  |Raico_Ralph|Ralph_Raico|  .  |Mises_Institute|Mises_Institute| .
