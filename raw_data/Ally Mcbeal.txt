           Ally McBeal is an American  |legal|Legal_Drama| |comedy-drama|Comedy-Drama| |television_series|Television_Series| , originally aired on  |Fox|Fox_Broadcasting_Company|  from September 8, 1997, to May 20, 2002. Created by  |David_E._Kelley|David_E._Kelley| , the series stars  |Calista_Flockhart|Calista_Flockhart|  in the  |title_role|Ally_Mcbeal|  as a lawyer working in the fictional  |Boston|Boston| |law_firm|List_Of_Fictional_Law_Firms|  Cage and Fish, with other lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric, humorous, and dramatic. The series received critical acclaim in its early seasons, winning the  |Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Television_Series_–_Musical_or_Comedy|Golden_Globe_Award_For_Best_Television_Series_&_Nbsp;–_Musical_Or_Comedy|  in 1997 and 1998, and also winning the  |Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Comedy_Series|Primetime_Emmy_Award_For_Outstanding_Comedy_Series|  in 1999.       The series, set in the fictional  |Boston|Boston| |law_firm|List_Of_Fictional_Law_Firms|  Cage and Fish, begins with main character  |Allison_Marie_Ally_McBeal|Ally_Mcbeal|  joining the firm co-owned by her law school classmate Richard Fish  after leaving her previous job due to sexual harassment. On her first day, Ally is horrified to find that she will be working alongside her ex-boyfriend Billy Thomas   whom she has never gotten over. To make things worse, Billy is now married to fellow lawyer Georgia , who later joins Cage and Fish. The triangle among the three forms the basis for the main plot for the shows first three seasons.     Although ostensibly a legal drama, the main focus of the series was the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, often using legal proceedings as  |plot_devices|Plot_Device|  to contrast or reinforce a characters drama. For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might provide a backdrop for Allys decision to break up with a boyfriend. Legal arguments were also frequently used to explore multiple sides of various social issues.     Cage and Fish , the fictional law firm where most of the characters work, is depicted as a highly sexualized environment symbolized by its unisex restroom. Lawyers and secretaries in the firm routinely date, flirt with, or have a romantic history with each other and frequently run into former or potential romantic interests in the courtroom or on the street outside.     The series had many offbeat and frequently surreal running gags and themes, such as Allys tendency to immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive, Richard Fishs  |wattle|Wattle|  fetish and humorous mottos , Johns gymnastic dismounts out of the offices unisex bathroom stalls, or the dancing twins at the bar, that ran through the series. The show also used vivid, dramatic  |fantasy|Fantasy|  sequences for Allys and other characters wishful thinking; of particular note is the early internet sensation the  |dancing_baby|Dancing_Baby| .     The series also featured regular visits to a local bar where singer  |Vonda_Shepard|Vonda_Shepard|  regularly performed . Star contemporary singers also performed in the bar at the end of the shows, including acts such as  |Barry_White|Barry_White|  and  |Anastacia|Anastacia| . The series also took place in the same  |continuity|Continuity|  as David E. Kelleys legal drama  The Practice  , as the two shows crossed over with one another on occasion, a very rare occurrence for two shows that aired on different networks.     Ultimately, in the last installment of the fifth and final season, Bygones , Ally decided to resign from Cage & Fish, leave Boston, and return to New York City.       Fox canceled Ally McBeal after five seasons. In addition to being the lowest-rated season of Ally McBeal and the grounds for the shows cancelation, the fifth season was also the only season of the show that failed to win any Emmy or Golden Globe awards.                            In Australia, Ally McBeal was aired by the  |Seven_Network|Seven_Network|  from 1997 to 2002. In 2010, it was aired repeatedly by  |Network_10|Network_10| .     The Practice   Seymore Walsh, a stern judge often exasperated by the eccentricities of the Cage & Fish lawyers and played by actor Albert Hall, was also a recurring character on The Practice. In addition, Judge Jennifer Cone appears on The Practice episode Line of Duty , while Judge Roberta Kittelson, a recurring character on The Practice, has a featured guest role in the Ally McBeal episode Do you Wanna Dance?     Most of the primary Practice cast members guest starred in the Ally McBeal episode The Inmates , in a storyline that concluded with the Practice episode Axe Murderer , featuring Calista Flockhart and Gil Bellows reprising their Ally characters. What is unusual about this continuing storyline is that Ally McBeal and The Practice aired on different networks. Bobby Donnell, the main character of The Practice played by  |Dylan_McDermott|Dylan_Mcdermott| , was featured heavily in both this crossover and another Ally McBeal episode, These are the Days .     Regular Practice cast members  |Lara_Flynn_Boyle|Lara_Flynn_Boyle|  and  |Michael_Badalucco|Michael_Badalucco|  each had a cameo in Ally McBeal but it is unclear whether they were playing the same characters they play on The Practice.         Upon premiering in 1997, the show was an instant hit, averaging around 11 million viewers per episode. The shows second season saw an increase in ratings and soon became a top 20 show, averaging around 13 million viewers per episode. The shows ratings began to decline in the third season, but stabilized in the fourth season after  |Robert_Downey_Jr.|Robert_Downey_Jr.|  joined the regular cast as Allys boyfriend Larry Paul, and a fresher aesthetic was created by new art director Matthew DeCoste. However, Downeys character was written out after the end of the season due to the actors troubles with drug addiction.      The first two seasons, as well as the fourth, remain the most critically acclaimed and saw the most awards success at the Emmys, SAG Awards and the Golden Globes. In 2007, Ally McBeal placed 48 on  Entertainment Weekly  2007 New TV Classics list.               Ally McBeal received some criticism from TV critics and feminists who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women  because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts,  and emotional instability. Perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the June 29, 1998, cover story of Time magazine, which juxtaposed McBeal with three pioneering feminists  and asked Is Feminism Dead?  In episode 12 of the second season of the show, Ally talks to her co-worker John Cage about a dream she had, saying You know, I had a dream that they put my face on the cover of Time magazine as the face of feminism.             Ally McBeal was a heavily music-oriented show.  |Vonda_Shepard|Vonda_Shepard| , a virtually unknown musician at the time, was featured continually on the show. Her song Searchin My Soul became the shows theme song. Many of the songs Shepard performed were established hits with lyrics that paralleled the events of the episode, including  |Both_Sides_Now|Both_Sides_Now|  ,  |Hooked_on_a_Feeling|Hooked_On_A_Feeling|  and  |Tell_Him|Tell_Him|  . Besides recording background music for the show, Shepard frequently appeared at the ends of episodes as a musician performing at a local  |piano_bar|Piano_Bar|  frequented by the main characters. On rare occasions, her character would have conventional dialogue. A portion of Searchin My Soul was played at the beginning of each episode, but the song was never played in its entirety.     Several of the characters had a musical  |leitmotif|Leitmotif|  that played when they appeared. John Cages was  |Youre_the_First,_the_Last,_My_Everything|Youre_The_First,_The_Last,_My_Everything|  , Ling Woos was the  |Wicked_Witch_of_the_West|Wicked_Witch_Of_The_West|  theme from  The Wizard of Oz , and Ally McBeal herself picked  |Tell_Him|Tell_Him|  , when told by a psychiatrist that she needed a theme.     Due to the popularity of the show and Shepards music, a soundtrack titled  Songs from Ally McBeal  was released in 1998, as well as a successor soundtrack titled  Heart and Soul: New Songs from Ally McBeal  in 1999. Two compilation albums from the show featuring Shepard were also released in 2000 and 2001. A Christmas album was also released under the title Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas.  The album received positive reviews, and Shephards version of  |Kay_Starrs|Kay_Starr|  Christmas song  |The_Man_with_the_Bag|The_Man_With_The_Bag|  , received considerable airplay during the holiday season.
