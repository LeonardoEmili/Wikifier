                           In  |fiction|Fiction|  and less frequently in  |non-fiction|Nonfiction| , satire is a  |genre|Genre|  of  |literature|Literature|  and  |performing_arts|Performing_Art| , in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive  |social_criticism|Social_Criticism| , using  |wit|Wit|  to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.     A feature of satire is strong  |irony|Irony|  or  |sarcasm|Sarcasm| — in satire, irony is militant   —but  |parody|Parody| ,  |burlesque|Burlesque| ,  |exaggeration|Exaggeration| , juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and  |double_entendre|Double_Entendre|  are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This militant irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of the very things the satirist wishes to attack.     Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including  |internet_memes|Internet_Meme| , literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.         The word satire comes from the  |Latin|Latin_Language|  word satur and the subsequent phrase  lanx satura . Satur meant full but the juxtaposition with lanx shifted the meaning to miscellany or medley : the expression lanx satura literally means a full dish of various kinds of fruits .      The word satura as used by  |Quintilian|Quintilian| , however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed  |hexameter|Hexameter|  form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as satire.  Quintilian famously said that satura, that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin . He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be  |Aristophanes_Old_Comedy|Aristophanes_Old_Comedy| . The first critic to use the term satire in the modern broader sense was  |Apuleius|Apuleius| .     To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:        The word satire derives from satura, and its origin was not influenced by the  |Greek_mythological|Greek_Mythology|  figure of the  satyr .  In the 17th century, philologist  |Isaac_Casaubon|Isaac_Casaubon|  was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time. Antonia Szabari Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France              |Laughter|Laughter|  is not an essential component of satire; in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be funny at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily satirical , even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and  |burlesque|Burlesque| .     Even light-hearted satire has a serious after-taste : the organizers of the  |Ig_Nobel_Prize|Ig_Nobel_Prize|  describe this as first make people laugh, and then make them think .        Satire and  |irony|Irony|  in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of  |social_study|Social_Study| . They provide the keenest insights into a groups  |collective_psyche|Collective_Unconscious| , reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the societys structures of power. Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or  |anthropology|Anthropology| .  In a prominent example from  |ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece| , philosopher  |Plato|Plato| , when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of  |Aristophanes|Aristophanes| .     Historically, satire has satisfied the popular  |need|Need|  to  |debunk|Debunk|  and  |ridicule|Ridiculous|  the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of  |power|Power| . Satire confronts  |public_discourse|Public_Discourse|  and the  |collective_imaginary|Collective_Imaginary| , playing as a public opinion counterweight to power , by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satires job is to expose problems and contradictions, and its not obligated to solve them.  |Karl_Kraus|Karl_Kraus|  set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.     For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions. The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension. Institutions like the  |ritual_clowns|Ritual_Clown| , by giving expression to the  |antisocial_tendencies|Antisocial_Tendencies| , represent a  |safety_valve|Safety_Valve|  which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the  |collective_imaginary|Collective_Imaginary| , which are jeopardized by the  |repressive_aspects_of_society|Social_Repression| .     The state of  |political_satire|Political_Satire|  in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it, and the state of  |civil_liberties|Civil_Liberties|  and  |human_rights|Human_Rights| . Under  |totalitarian_regimes|Totalitarianism|  any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  where the  |dissidents|Dissidents| , such as  |Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn|Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn|  and  |Andrei_Sakharov|Andrei_Sakharov|  were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the  |USSR|Soviet_Union|  was allowed, the most prominent satirist being  |Arkady_Raikin|Arkady_Raikin| , political satire existed in the form of  |anecdotes|Anecdote|   that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially  |Brezhnev|Brezhnev| , famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.       Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric modes . Corum  David Worcester  p.16          Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or  |Menippean|Menippean_Satire| .        Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist  |Horace|Horace|  , playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece .  Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of gently the absurdities and follies of human beings .      It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satires sympathetic tone is common in modern society.      A Horatian satirists goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile. A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways.  |Alexander_Pope|Alexander_Pope|  has been established as an author whose satire heals with morals what it hurts with wit .  Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.     Examples of Horatian satire:     The  |Ig_Nobel_Prizes|Ig_Nobel_Prize| .   .   .   The  |Savoy_Operas|Savoy_Operas|  of  |Gilbert_and_Sullivan|Gilbert_And_Sullivan| .   .   .   .   .   .    |More,_Thomas|Thomas_More| ,  Utopia  .   .   .   .            Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist  |Juvenal|Juvenal|  , is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent .  Juvenals satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.     Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.     A Juvenal satirists goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.  A Juvenal satirist mocks societal structure, power, and civilization  by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponents reputation and/or power.  |Jonathan_Swift|Jonathan_Swift|  has been established as an author who borrowed heavily from Juvenals techniques in of contemporary English society .     Examples of Juvenalian satire:   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   , an adaptation of .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .       See  |Menippean_satire|Menippean_Satire| .       In the  |history_of_theatre|History_Of_Theatre|  there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on  |politics|Politics|  and relevant issue, between satire and  |grotesque|Grotesque|  on one side, and  |jest|Jest|  with  |teasing|Teasing|  on the other.  |Max_Eastman|Max_Eastman|  defined the  |spectrum|Spectrum|  of satire in terms of degrees of biting , as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and kidding at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target.   |Nobel_laureate|Nobel_Prize_In_Literature|  satirical playwright  |Dario_Fo|Dario_Fo|  pointed out the difference between satire and teasing .  Teasing is the  |reactionary|Reactionary|  side of the  |comic|Comic| ; it limits itself to a shallow  |parody|Parody|  of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a  |subversive|Subversive|  character, and a  |moral|Moral|  dimension which draws judgement against its targets.   Fo formulated an  |operational|Operational_Definition|  criterion to tell real satire from sfottò, saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing.  Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.     Teasing  is an ancient form of simple  |buffoonery|Buffoonery| , a form of comedy without satires subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an  |impersonation|Impressionist|  of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes,  |tics|Tic| , physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with  |irony|Irony| ; it never harms the targets conduct,  |ideology|Ideology|  and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension.  Sfottò directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him.   |Hermann_Göring|Hermann_Göring|  propagated  |jests|Jest|  and jokes against himself, with the aim of humanizing his image.         Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of  |Aristophanes|Aristophanes| , the primary topics of literary satire have been  |politics|Politics| ,  |religion|Religion|  and  |sex|Sex| . Ferdie Addis Qual è il tuo tallone da killer ?  This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually  |taboo|Taboo| . Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire. Satire which targets the  |clergy|Clergy|  is a type of  |political_satire|Political_Satire| , while  |religious_satire|Religious_Satire|  is that which targets  |religious_beliefs|Religious_Belief| . Satire on sex may overlap with  |blue_comedy|Blue_Comedy| ,  |off-color_humor|Off-Color_Humor|  and  |dick_jokes|Dick_Joke| .      |Scatology|Scatology|  has a long literary association with satire, as it is a classical mode of the  |grotesque|Grotesque| , the  |grotesque_body|Grotesque_Body|  and the satiric grotesque.  |Shit|Shit|  plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes  |death|Death| , the turd being the ultimate dead object . The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human  |excrement|Excrement| , exposes their inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness . The  |ritual_clowns|Ritual_Clown|  of  |clown_societies|Clown_Societies| , like among the  |Pueblo_Indians|Pueblo_Indians| , have ceremonies with  |filth-eating|Coprophagia| . In other cultures,  |sin-eating|Sin-Eating|  is an  |apotropaic|Apotropaic_Magic|  rite in which the sin-eater , Donald Alexander Mackenzie Myths of Pre-Columbian America  Patrick Marnham Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera  by ingesting the food provided, takes upon himself the sins of the departed . Satire about death overlaps with  |black_humor|Black_Humor|  and  |gallows_humor|Gallows_Humor| .     Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners. Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire.  |Comedy_of_manners|Comedy_Of_Manners| , sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes. Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.     Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible  |tones|Tone| :  |wit|Wit| ,  |ridicule|Ridicule| ,  |irony|Irony| ,  |sarcasm|Sarcasm| ,  |cynicism|Cynicism| , the  |sardonic|Sardonic|  and  |invective|Invective| .       Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In  |preliterate_cultures|Preliterate_Culture|  it manifests itself in  |ritual|Ritual_Clown|  and folk forms, as well as in  |trickster|Trickster|  tales and  |oral_poetry|Oral_Poetry| .     It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance,  |cartoon_strips|Cartoon_Strip| , and  |graffiti|Graffiti| . Examples are  |Dada|Dada|  sculptures,  |Pop_Art|Pop_Art|  works, music of  |Gilbert_and_Sullivan|Gilbert_And_Sullivan|  and  |Erik_Satie|Erik_Satie| ,  |punk|Punk_Rock|  and  |rock_music|Rock_Music| . In modern  |media_culture|Media_Culture| ,  |stand-up_comedy|Stand-Up_Comedy|  is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into  |mass_media|Mass_Media| , challenging  |mainstream|Mainstream|  discourse.  |Comedy_roasts|Roast| , mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.                    One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire,  |The_Satire_of_the_Trades|The_Satire_Of_The_Trades| ,  is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The texts apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck  think that the context was meant to be serious.     The  |Papyrus_Anastasi_I|Papyrus_Anastasi_I|   contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the readers meagre knowledge and achievements.       The Greeks had no word for what later would be called satire , although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the  |Greek_playwright|Greek_Comedy| |Aristophanes|Aristophanes|  one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and  |societal_commentary|Societal_Commentary| ,  particularly for the  |political_satire|Political_Satire|  by which he criticized the powerful  |Cleon|Cleon|  . He is also notable for the persecution he underwent.    Aristophanes plays turned upon images of filth and disease. His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian  |Menander|Menander| . His early play Drunkenness contains an attack on the politician  |Callimedon|Callimedon| .     The oldest form of satire still in use is the  |Menippean_satire|Menippean_Satire|  by  |Menippus_of_Gadara|Menippus| . His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of  |diatribe|Wikt:Diatribe| . As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.       The first Roman to discuss satire critically was  |Quintilian|Quintilian| , who invented the term to describe the writings of  |Gaius_Lucilius|Gaius_Lucilius| . The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are  |Horace|Horace|  and  |Juvenal|Satires_Of_Juvenal| , who wrote during the early days of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| . Other important satirists in ancient  |Latin|Latin|  are Gaius Lucilius and  |Persius|Persius| . Satire in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized  |Augustus|Augustus| , he used  |veil|Veil| ed ironic terms. In contrast,  |Pliny|Pliny_The_Elder|  reports that the 6th-century-BC poet  |Hipponax|Hipponax|  wrote satirae that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.      In the 2nd century AD,  |Lucian|Lucian|  wrote  True History , a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by  |Ctesias|Ctesias| ,  |Iambulus|Iambulus| , and  |Homer|Homer| . He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like  Indica  and  The Odyssey .            Medieval  |Arabic_poetry|Arabic_Poetry|  included the satiric genre hija. Satire was introduced into  |Arabic_prose_literature|Arabic_Literature|  by the  |Afro-Arab|Afro-Arab|  author  |Al-Jahiz|Al-Jahiz|  in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as  |anthropology|Anthropology| ,  |sociology|Sociology_In_Medieval_Islam|  and  |psychology|Psychology_In_Medieval_Islam| , he introduced a satirical approach, based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in hija, satirical poetry.  For example, in one of his  |zoological|Zoology|  works, he satirized the preference for longer  |human_penis_size|Human_Penis_Size| , writing: If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the  |mule|Mule|  would belong to the  |Quraysh|Quraysh|  . Another satirical story based on this preference was an  Arabian Nights  tale called Ali with the Large Member .      In the 10th century, the writer  |Thaalibi|Thaalibi|  recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulafs  |wide_breadth_of_knowledge|Polymath|  and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return. An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as a transgressor of the  |Sharia|Sharia|  and later Arabic poets in turn using the term Farazdaq-like as a form of political satire.     The terms  |comedy|Comedy|  and satire became synonymous after  |Aristotles|Aristotle|   Poetics  was translated into  |Arabic|Arabic_Language|  in the  |medieval_Islamic_world|Islamic_Golden_Age| , where it was elaborated upon by  |Islamic_philosophers|Early_Islamic_Philosophy|  and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil  |Al-Farabi|Al-Farabi| ,  |Avicenna|Avicenna| , and  |Averroes|Averroes| . Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from  |Greek_drama|Greek_Drama| tic representation and instead identified it with  |Arabic_poetic|Arabic_Poetry|  themes and forms, such as hija . They viewed comedy as simply the art of reprehension , and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the  |Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century|Latin_Translations_Of_The_12Th_Century| , the term comedy thus gained a new semantic meaning in  |Medieval_literature|Medieval_Literature| .       |Ubayd_Zakani|Ubayd_Zakani|  introduced satire in  |Persian_literature|Persian_Literature|  during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving  |homosexual|Homosexual|  practices. He wrote the Resaleh-ye Delgosha, as well as Akhlaq al-Ashraf and the famous humorous fable Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh , which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of  |Persian_literature|Persian_Literature| . Between 1905 and 1911,  |Bibi_Khatoon_Astarabadi|Bibi_Khatoon_Astarabadi|  and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.       In the  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages| , examples of satire were the songs by  |Goliards|Goliard|  or  |vagants|Clerici_Vagantes|  now best known as an anthology called  |Carmina_Burana|Carmina_Burana|  and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer  |Carl_Orff|Carl_Orff| . Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages|  and the birth of modern  |vernacular_literature|Vernacular_Literature|  in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by  |Chaucer|Chaucer| . The disrespectful manner was considered unchristian and ignored, except for the moral satire, which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are Livre des Manières by  , and some of Chaucers  Canterbury Tales . Sometimes  |epic_poetry|Epic_Poetry|  was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.          Direct  |social_commentary|Social_Commentary|  via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of  |François_Rabelais|François_Rabelais|  tackled more serious issues .     Two major satirists of  |Europe|Europe|  in the  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  were  |Giovanni_Boccaccio|Giovanni_Boccaccio|  and  |François_Rabelais|François_Rabelais| . Other examples of Renaissance satire include  Till Eulenspiegel ,  Reynard the Fox ,  |Sebastian_Brants|Sebastian_Brant|   Narrenschiff  ,  |Erasmuss|Erasmus|   Moriae Encomium  ,  |Thomas_Mores|Thomas_More|   Utopia  , and  Carajicomedia  .     The Elizabethan writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan satire therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French Huguenot Isaac Casaubon pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilians writing and presented the original meaning of the term , and the sense of wittiness became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the amendment of vices .     In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of Hall s Virgidemiarum, six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although Donne had already circulated satires in manuscript, Halls was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model. The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeths reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Halls — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.       Satire  has played a prominent role in Indian and Hindi literature , and is counted as one of the ras of literature in ancient books. With the commencement of printing of books in local language in the nineteenth century and especially after Indias freedom, this grew. Many of the works of Tulsi Das , Kabir , Munshi Premchand , village ministrels, Hari katha singers, poets, Dalit singers and current day stand up Indian comedians incorporate satire, usually ridiculing authoritarians, fundamentalists and incompetent people in power. In India, it has usually been used as a means of expression and an outlet for common people to express their anger against authoritarian entities. A popular custom in Northern India of Bura na mano Holi hai continues, in which comedians on the stage roast local people of importance .       thu     The Age of Enlightenment , an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the Tory and Whig parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the Scriblerus Club , which included Alexander Pope , Jonathan Swift , John Gay , John Arbuthnot , Robert Harley , Thomas Parnell , and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke . This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship . In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting juvenal satire. Weinbrot, Howard D. Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...     Jonathan Swift was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his  |A_Modest_Proposal|A_Modest_Proposal|  Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the problem of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book  |Gullivers_Travels|Gullivers_Travels|  he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. John Dryden wrote an influential essay entitled A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical  |Mac_Flecknoe|Mac_Flecknoe|  was written in response to a rivalry with Thomas Shadwell and eventually inspired Alexander Pope to write his satirical  |The_Rape_of_the_Lock|The_Rape_Of_The_Lock| . Other satirical works by Pope include the  |Epistle_to_Dr_Arbuthnot|Epistle_To_Dr_Arbuthnot| .     Alexander Pope was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the  |Iliad|Iliad| . Famous throughout and after the long 18th century , Pope died in 1744. Pope, in his The Rape of the Lock, is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. The Rape of the Lock assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the Iliad, which Pope was translating at the time of writing The Rape of the Lock. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.     Daniel Defoe pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his  |The_True-Born_Englishman|The_True-Born_Englishman|  which mocks xenophobic patriotism, and  |The_Shortest-Way_with_the_Dissenters|The_Shortest-Way_With_The_Dissenters| —advocating religious toleration by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.     The pictorial satire of William Hogarth is a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th-century England. The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, James Gillray from London. With his satirical works calling the king , prime ministers and generals to account, Gillrays wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent cartoonist of the era.     Ebenezer Cooke , author of The Sot-Weed Factor , was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. Benjamin Franklin and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nations culture through its sense of the ridiculous.       thu   Several satiric papers competed for the publics attention in the Victorian era and Edwardian period, such as  |Punch|Punch|  and  |Fun|Fun|  .     Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the Savoy Opera s of Gilbert and Sullivan . In fact, in  |The_Yeomen_of_the_Guard|The_Yeomen_Of_The_Guard| , a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilberts own intent:   : I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,   :The upstart I can wither with a whim;   :He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,   :But his laughter has an echo that is grim!     Novelists such as Charles Dickens often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.     Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, Sidney Godolphin Osborne was the most prominent writer of scathing Letters to the Editor of the London Times . Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the Junius letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfathers satiric Letters to the Editor path. Osbornes satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from Parliament s then Home Secretary Sir James Graham . Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British governments and landlords mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the New Poor Laws and was passionate on the subject of Great Britains botched response to the Irish Famine and its mistreatment of soldiers during the Crimean War .     Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, Mark Twain grew to become Americans greatest satirist: his novel  |Huckleberry_Finn|Adventures_Of_Huckleberry_Finn|  is set in the antebellum South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the sinful temptation that leads him to help a runaway slave . In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.     Twains younger contemporary Ambrose Bierce gained notoriety as a cynic , pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the American Civil War , which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierces most famous work of satire is probably  |The_Devils_Dictionary|The_Devils_Dictionary|  , in which the definitions mock cant, hypocrisy and received wisdom .       Karl Kraus is considered the first major European satirist since Jonathan Swift . Knight, Charles A. Literature of Satire In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as Aldous Huxley and George Orwell , which under the inspiration of Zamyatin s Russian 1921 novel  |We|We| , made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Anatoly Lunacharsky wrote ‘Satire attains its greatest significance when a newly evolving class creates an ideology considerably more advanced than that of the ruling class, but has not yet developed to the point where it can conquer it. Herein lies its truly great ability to triumph, its scorn for its adversary and its hidden fear of it. Herein lies its venom, its amazing energy of hate, and quite frequently, its grief, like a black frame around glittering images. Herein lie its contradictions, and its power.’ David King & Cathy Porter Blood & Laughter: Caricatures from the 1905 Revolution Jonathan Cape 1983 p.31 Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken , used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogism s in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist Sinclair Lewis was known for his satirical stories such as  |Main_Street|Main_Street|  ,  |Babbitt|Babbitt|  ,  |Elmer_Gantry|Elmer_Gantry|  , and  |It_Cant_Happen_Here|It_Cant_Happen_Here|  , and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film  |The_Great_Dictator|The_Great_Dictator|  by Charlie Chaplin is itself a parody of Adolf Hitler ; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the concentration camps . Chaplin My Autobiography, p.392, quotation:     thu in The Great Dictator . Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the concentration camps .

As they challenged the taboo s and conventional wisdom of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as  |sick_comedians|Sick_Comedian|  . In the same period, Paul Krassner s magazine  |The_Realist|The_Realist|  began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the counterculture ; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon , the Vietnam War , the Cold War and the War on Drugs . This baton was also carried by the original National Lampoon magazine, edited by Doug Kenney and Henry Beard and featuring blistering satire written by Michael ODonoghue , P.J. ORourke , and Tony Hendra , among others. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/funny-pages-how-the-national-lampoon-made-american-humor.html Prominent satiric stand-up comedian George Carlin acknowledged the influence The Realist had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian. Sullivan, James Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin George Carlin  to Murder At the Conspiracy Convention     A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the satire boom , led by such luminaries as Peter Cook , Alan Bennett , Jonathan Miller , and Dudley Moore , whose stage show  |Beyond_the_Fringe|Beyond_The_Fringe|  was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States.

Departing from traditional Hollywood farce and screwball , director and comedian Jerry Lewis used satire in his self-directed films  |The_Bellboy|The_Bellboy|  ,  |The_Errand_Boy|The_Errand_Boy|  and  |The_Patsy|The_Patsy|  to comment on celebrity and the star-making machinery of Hollywood.   The film  |Dr._Strangelove|Dr._Strangelove|  starring Peter Sellers was a popular satire on the Cold War .       Contemporary popular usage of the term satire is often very imprecise. While satire often uses caricature and parody , by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.     thu from the British satirical puppet show Spitting Image   Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as  |Mock_the_Week|Mock_The_Week|  and  |Have_I_Got_News_for_You|Have_I_Got_News_For_You|  . It is found on radio quiz shows such as  |The_News_Quiz|The_News_Quiz|  and  |The_Now_Show|The_Now_Show|  . One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show  |Spitting_Image|Spitting_Image|  was a satire of the royal family , politics, entertainment, sport and British culture of the era.

Australian Chris Lilley produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries  and his work is often described as complex social satire.     thu satirically impersonated an opinionated and self-righteous television commentator on his Comedy Central program in the U.S.   Stephen Colbert s television program,  |The_Colbert_Report|The_Colbert_Report|  , is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. Colberts character is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and unwittingly uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.     The American sketch comedy television show  |Saturday_Night_Live|Saturday_Night_Live|  is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures Hillary Clinton Retrieved August 15, 2015 and of Sarah Palin .     Other political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful Polish Beer-Lovers Party and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog and Brian Miner .     In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist was the late Sir Terry Pratchett , author of the internationally best-selling  |Discworld|Discworld|  book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is Chris Morris , co-writer and director of  |Four_Lions|Four_Lions| .     In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. Stephen Leacock was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including  |CODCO|Codco| ,  |The_Royal_Canadian_Air_Farce|The_Royal_Canadian_Air_Farce| ,  |This_Is_That|This_Is_That| , and  |This_Hour_Has_22_Minutes|This_Hour_Has_22_Minutes|  deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like  |History_Bites|History_Bites|  present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization  |Canada_News_Network|Canada_News_Network|  provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter Nancy White uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on CBC Radio .     Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. Al Capp s satirical comic strip  |Lil_Abner|Lil_Abner|  was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in Time, centred on Capps portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, We dont think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables. Walt Kelly s  |Pogo|Pogo|  was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of Senator Joe McCarthy , caricatured in his comic strip as Simple J. Malarky . Garry Trudeau , whose comic strip  |Doonesbury|Doonesbury|  focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character Mark Slackmeyer lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the exquisite agony of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.     thu   Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and caricature ; for instance, the popular animated series The Simpsons and South Park both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.     News satire is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print , Not Your Homepage, radio , television  and the web . Other satires are on the list of satirists and satires . Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the Internet meme character Miranda Sings .     In an interview with  |Wikinews|Wikinews| , Sean Mills, President of  |The_Onion|The_Onion| , said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. Its whatever affects that person , said Mills. So its like, I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and thats not funny to me. Or someone else can say, Cancers hilarious, but dont talk about rape because my cousin got raped. Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it. An interview with The Onion , David Shankbone,  |Wikinews|Wikinews| , November 25, 2007.     Zhou Libo , a comedian from Shanghai , is the most popular satirist in China. His humour has interested middle-class people and has sold-out shows ever since his rise to fame.     Paweł Kuczyński is a polish artist that has been awarded many prices for his works on political satyre. His topics range from the absurdity of war to the absorbing power of todays technology.       Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, reprising previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice. Griffin, Dustin H. Satire: A Critical Reintroduction Exaggeration is one of the most common satirical techniques. Claridge, Claudia Hyperbole in English: A Corpus-based Study of Exaggeration Contrarily diminution is also a satirical technique.       For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions. In Germany and Italy satire is protected by the constitution.     Since satire belongs to the realm of art and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere freedom of information of journalistic kind. In some countries a specific right to satire is recognized and its limits go beyond the right to report of journalism and even the right to criticize . Satire benefits not only of the protection to freedom of speech , but also to that to culture , and that to scientific and artistic production.         In September 2017 The Juice Media received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the Coat of Harms based on the Australian Coat of Arms , no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public. Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to Australian parliament to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 . If successfully passed those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment.     As of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment Bill 2017 was before the Australian Senate with the third reading moved May 10, 2018.

Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.       Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his persona .       Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swifts purpose in  |A_Modest_Proposal|A_Modest_Proposal| , assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.       Some critics of Mark Twain see Huckleberry Finn as racist and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire . This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire  |Till_Death_Us_Do_Part|Till_Death_Us_Do_Part| . The character of Alf Garnett was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, little Englander that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of anti-hero to people who actually agreed with his views.      The Australian satirical television comedy show  |The_Chasers_War_on_Everything|The_Chasers_War_On_Everything|  has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the target of its attacks. The Make a Realistic Wish Foundation sketch , which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to charities , was widely interpreted as an attack on the Make a Wish Foundation , or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. Prime Minister of the time Kevin Rudd stated that The Chaser team should hang their heads in shame . He went on to say that I didnt see that but its been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale. Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.       The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the romantic movement that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day. Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study. For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.       thu   Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes censorship in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, Aristophanes was persecuted by the demagogue Cleon .       In 1599, the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft , whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in England , issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the Bishops Ban of 1599 , ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by John Marston , Thomas Middleton , Joseph Hall , and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queens Privy Council , and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.     The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the Martin Marprelate controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey , two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.       In 2005, the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many fatalities in the Near East . It was not the first case of Muslim protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any countrys flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the freedom of speech , and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an International Holocaust Cartoon Competition , which was immediately responded to by Jews with an Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest .     In 2006 British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen released  |Borat:_Cultural_Learnings_of_America_for_Make_Benefit_Glorious_Nation_of_Kazakhstan|Borat| , a mockumentary that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was antisemitic , and the government of Kazakhstan boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.     In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist Jonathan Shapiro came under fire for depicting then-president of the ANC Jacob Zuma in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of Lady Justice which is held down by Zuma loyalists. The cartoon was drawn in response to Zumas efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of rape in May 2006. In February 2009, the South African Broadcasting Corporation , viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC, shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro, and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast. Apartheid South Africa also had a long history of censorship.

Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on Have I Got News for You regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties. BBC. Retrieved June 18, 2015       Satire is occasionally prophetic: the jokes precede actual events.
