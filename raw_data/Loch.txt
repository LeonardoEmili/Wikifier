           Loch  is the  |Irish|Irish_Language| ,  |Scottish_Gaelic|Scottish_Gaelic|  and  |Scots|Scots_Language|  word for a  |lake|Lake|  or for a sea  |inlet|Inlet| . It is  |cognate|Cognate|  with the  |Manx|Manx_Language|  lough,  |Cornish|Cornish_Language|  logh, and one of the  |Welsh|Welsh_Language|  words for lake, llwch.     In  |English_English|English_English|  and  |Hiberno_English|Hiberno_English| , the  |anglicised|Anglicisation|  spelling lough is commonly found in place names; in  |Lowland_Scots|Scots_Language|  and  |Scottish_English|Scottish_English| , the spelling loch is always used.     Some lochs could also be called  |firths|Firth| ,  |fjords|Fjord| ,  |estuaries|Estuary| ,  |straits|Strait|  or  |bays|Bay| . Sea-inlet lochs are often called sea lochs or sea loughs. Many loughs are connected to stories of  |lake_bursts|Lake_Burst| , signifying their mythical origin.                   This name for a body of water is  |Insular_Celtic|Insular_Celtic_Languages|  The current form has currency in the following languages:  |Scottish_Gaelic|Scottish_Gaelic| ,  |Irish|Irish_Language| ,  |Manx|Manx_Language| , and has been borrowed into  |Lowland_Scots|Scots_Language| ,  |Scottish_English|Scottish_English| ,  |Irish_English|Irish_English|  and  |Standard_English|Standard_English| . in origin and is applied to most lakes in   Scotland and to many sea inlets in the west and north of Scotland. The word is  |Indo_European|Indo_European_Languages|  in origin; cf.  |Latin|Latin|  lacus.      |Lowland_Scots|Scots_Language|  orthography, like Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Irish, represents  with ch, so the word was borrowed with identical spelling.     English borrowed the word separately from a number of loughs in the previous  |Cumbric|Cumbric|  language areas of  |Northumbria|Northumbria|  and  |Cumbria|Cumbria| . Earlier forms of English included the sound  as gh . However, by the time Scotland and England joined under a single parliament, English had lost the  sound. This form was therefore used when the English settled Ireland. The Scots convention of using ch remained, hence the modern Scottish English loch.     Likewise, in the Insular Celtic languages, the representation of , is lu in  |Old_Welsh|Old_Welsh|  and llw in  |Middle_Welsh|Middle_Welsh|  such as in todays Welsh placenames  |Llanllwchaiarn|Llanllwchaiarn| ,  |Llwchwr|Llwchwr| ,  |Llyn_Cwm_Llwch|Llyn_Cwm_Llwch| ,  |Amlwch|Amlwch| ,  |Maesllwch|Glasbury| , the Goidelic lo being taken into Scottish Gaelic by the gradual replacement of much  |Brittonic|Brittonic_Languages|  orthography with  |Goidelic|Goidelic_Languages|  orthography in Scotland.     Many of the loughs in Northern England have also previously been called meres such as the Black Lough in  |Northumberland|Northumberland| .  However, reference to the latter as loughs , rather than as lakes, inlets and so on, is unusual.     Some lochs in Southern Scotland have a Brythonic rather than Goidelic etymology, such as  |Loch_Ryan|Loch_Ryan|  where the Gaelic loch has replaced a  |Cumbric|Cumbric|  equivalent of Welsh llwch.  The same is perhaps the case for water bodies in  |Northern_England|Northern_England|  named with Low or Lough or otherwise it represents a borrowing of the Brythonic word into the Northumbrian dialect of Old English.     Although there is no strict size definition, a small loch is often known as a lochan .     Perhaps the most famous Scottish loch is  |Loch_Ness|Loch_Ness| , although there are other large examples such as  |Loch_Awe|Loch_Awe| ,  |Loch_Lomond|Loch_Lomond|  and  |Loch_Tay|Loch_Tay| .     Examples of sea lochs in Scotland include  |Loch_Long|Loch_Long| ,  |Loch_Fyne|Loch_Fyne| ,  |Loch_Linnhe|Loch_Linnhe| , and  |Loch_Eriboll|Loch_Eriboll| .       Some new  |reservoirs|Reservoir|  for  |hydroelectric|Hydroelectricity|  schemes have been given names faithful to the names for natural bodies of waterâ€”for example, the Loch Sloy scheme, and Lochs  |Laggan|Loch_Laggan|  and  |Treig|Loch_Treig|  . Other expanses are simply called reservoirs, e.g.  |Blackwater_Reservoir|Blackwater_Reservoir|  above  |Kinlochleven|Kinlochleven| .       Scotland has very few bodies of water called lakes. The  |Lake_of_Menteith|Lake_Of_Menteith| , an  |Anglicisation|Anglicisation|  of the  |Scots|Scots_Language|  Laich o Menteith meaning a low-lying bit of land in Menteith , is applied to the loch there because of the similarity of the sounds of the words laich and lake. Until the 19th century the body of water was known as the Loch of Menteith.  The  |Lake_of_the_Hirsel|Lake_Of_The_Hirsel| ,  |Pressmennan_Lake|Pressmennan_Lake|  and Lake Louise are man-made bodies of water in Scotland known as lakes.     The word loch is sometimes used as a  |shibboleth|Shibboleth|  to identify natives of England, because the fricative  sound is used in Scotland whereas most English people pronounce the word like lock .       As loch is a common Gaelic word, it is found as the root of several  |Manx|Manx_Language|  place names.     The United States naval port of  |Pearl_Harbor|Naval_Station_Pearl_Harbor| , on the south coast of the main  |Hawaii|Hawaii| an island of  |Oahu|Oahu| , is one of a complex of sea inlets. Several are named as lochs, including South East Loch, Merry Loch, East Loch, Middle Loch and West Loch.      |Loch_Raven_Reservoir|Loch_Raven_Reservoir|  is a reservoir in Baltimore County, Maryland.      |Brenton_Loch|Brenton_Loch|  in the  |Falkland_Islands|Falkland_Islands|  is a sea loch, near  |Lafonia|Lafonia| ,  |East_Falkland|East_Falkland| .     In the Scottish settlement of  |Glengarry_County|Glengarry_County_Ontario|  in present-day  |Eastern_Ontario|Eastern_Ontario| , there is a lake called Loch Garry.  Loch Garry was named by those who settled in the area,  |Clan_MacDonell_of_Glengarry|Clan_Macdonell_Of_Glengarry| , after the well-known loch their clan is from,  |Loch_Garry|Loch_Garry|  in Scotland. Similarly, lakes named  |Loch_Broom|Loch_Broom| ,  |Big_Loch|Big_Loch| ,  |Greendale_Loch|Greendale_Loch| , and  |Loch_Lomond|Loch_Lomond|  can be found in  |Nova_Scotia|Nova_Scotia| , along with  |Loch_Leven|Loch_Leven_Newfoundland_And_Labrador|  in  |Newfoundland|Newfoundland| , and  |Loch_Leven|Loch_Leven_Saskatchewan|  in  |Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan| .      |Loch_Fyne|Loch_Fyne|  is a  |fjord|Fjord|  in  |Greenland|Greenland|  named by  |Douglas_Clavering|Douglas_Clavering| .
