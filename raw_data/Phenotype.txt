                 In  |genetics|Genetics| , the phenotype  of an organism is the composite of the  |organisms|Organism|  observable characteristics or  |traits|Trait| . The term covers the organisms  |morphology|Morphology|  or physical form and structure, its  |development|Developmental_Biology| al processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its  |behavior|Behavior| , and the products of behavior. An organisms phenotype results from two basic factors: the  |expression|Gene_Expression|  of an organisms genetic code, or its  |genotype|Genotype| , and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called  |polymorphic|Polymorphism| . A well-documented example of polymorphism is  |Labrador_Retriever_coloring|Labrador_Retriever_Coat_Colour_Genetics| ; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown.  |Richard_Dawkins|Richard_Dawkins|  in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book  The Extended Phenotype  suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as  |caddis-fly|Caddis_Fly|  larvae cases and  |beaver_dams|Beaver_Dam|  as extended phenotypes .      |Wilhelm_Johannsen|Wilhelm_Johannsen|  proposed the  |genotype-phenotype_distinction|Genotype-Phenotype_Distinction|  in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organisms  |heredity|Heredity|  and what that heredity produces.   The distinction resembles that proposed by  |August_Weismann|August_Weismann|  , who distinguished between  |germ_plasm|Germ_Plasm|  and  |somatic_cells|Somatic_Cell|  .     The genotype-phenotype distinction should not be confused with  |Francis_Cricks|Francis_Crick| |central_dogma_of_molecular_biology|Central_Dogma_Of_Molecular_Biology| , a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from  |DNA|Dna|  to protein, and not the reverse.          The term phenotype has sometimes been incorrectly used as a shorthand for phenotypic difference from  |wild_type|Wild_Type| , bringing the statement that a mutation has no phenotype.      Despite its seemingly straightforward definition, the concept of the phenotype has hidden subtleties. It may seem that anything dependent on the  |genotype|Genotype|  is a phenotype, including molecules such as RNA and proteins. Most  |molecules|Molecules|  and structures coded by the genetic material are not visible in the appearance of an organism, yet they are observable  and are thus part of the phenotype; human  |blood_groups|Human_Blood_Group_Systems|  are an example. It may seem that this goes beyond the original intentions of the concept with its focus on the organism in itself. Either way, the term phenotype includes inherent traits or characteristics that are observable or traits that can be made visible by some technical procedure. A notable extension to this idea is the presence of organic molecules or metabolites that are generated by organisms from chemical reactions of enzymes.     Another extension adds behavior to the phenotype, since behaviors are observable characteristics. Behavioral phenotypes include cognitive, personality, and behavioral patterns. Some behavioral phenotypes may characterize psychiatric disorders  or syndromes.                 Phenotypic variation  is a fundamental prerequisite for  |evolution|Evolution|  by  |natural_selection|Natural_Selection| . It is the living organism as a whole that contributes to the next generation, so natural selection affects the genetic structure of a population indirectly via the contribution of phenotypes. Without phenotypic variation, there would be no evolution by natural selection.      The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship:     :genotype + environment → phenotype     A more nuanced version of the relationship is:     :genotype + environment + genotype & environment interactions → phenotype     Genotypes often have much flexibility in the modification and expression of phenotypes; in many organisms these phenotypes are very different under varying environmental conditions . The plant  Hieracium umbellatum  is found growing in two different  |habitats|Habitat|  in Sweden. One habitat is rocky, sea-side  |cliffs|Cliff| , where the plants are bushy with broad leaves and expanded  |inflorescences|Inflorescence| ; the other is among  |sand_dunes|Dune|  where the plants grow prostrate with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. These habitats alternate along the coast of Sweden and the habitat that the seeds of Hieracium umbellatum land in, determine the phenotype that grows.      An example of random variation in  Drosophila  flies is the number of  |ommatidia|Ommatidia| , which may vary between left and right eyes in a single individual as much as they do between different genotypes overall, or between  |clones|Cloning|  raised in different environments.     The concept of phenotype can be extended to variations below the level of the gene that affect an organisms fitness. For example,  |silent_mutations|Silent_Mutations|  that do not change the corresponding amino acid sequence of a gene may change the frequency of  |guanine|Guanine| - |cytosine|Cytosine|  base pairs . These base pairs have a higher thermal stability  than  |adenine|Adenine| - |thymine|Thymine| , a property that might convey, among organisms living in high-temperature environments, a selective advantage on variants enriched in GC content.             |Richard_Dawkins|Richard_Dawkins|  described a phenotype that included all effects that a gene has on its surroundings, including other organisms, as an extended phenotype, arguing that An animals behavior tends to maximize the survival of the genes for that behavior, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.  For instance, an organism such as a  |beaver|Beaver|  modifies its environment by building a  |beaver_dam|Beaver_Dam| ; this can be considered an expression of its  |genes|Gene| , just as its  |incisor|Incisor|  teeth are—which it uses to modify its environment. Similarly, when a bird feeds a  |brood_parasite|Brood_Parasite|  such as a  |cuckoo|Cuckoo| , it is unwittingly extending its phenotype; and when genes in an  |orchid|Orchid|  affect  |orchid_bee|Orchid_Bee|  behavior to increase pollination, or when genes in a  |peacock|Peacock|  affect the copulatory decisions of peahens, again, the phenotype is being extended. Genes are, in Dawkinss view, selected by their phenotypic effects.      Other biologists broadly agree that the extended phenotype concept is relevant, but consider that its role is largely explanatory, rather than assisting in the design of experimental tests.           Although a phenotype is the ensemble of observable characteristics displayed by an organism, the word  phenome  is sometimes used to refer to a collection of traits, while the simultaneous study of such a collection is referred to as  phenomics .   Phenomics is an important field of study because it can be used to figure out which genomic variants affect phenotypes which then can be used to explain things like health, disease, and evolutionary fitness.  Phenomics forms a large part of the  |Human_Genome_Project|Human_Genome_Project|       Phenomics has widespread applications in the agricultural industry. With an exponentially growing population and inconsistent weather patterns due to global warming, it has become increasingly difficult to cultivate enough crops to support the world’s population. Advantageous genomic variations, like drought and heat resistance, can be identified through the use of phenomics to create more durable GMOs.       Phenomics is also a crucial stepping stone towards personalized medicine, particularly drug therapy. This application of phenomics has the greatest potential to avoid testing drug therapies that will prove to be ineffective or unsafe.
