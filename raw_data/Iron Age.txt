      The Iron Age is the final epoch of the  |three_age_division|Three_Age_System|  of the  |prehistory|Prehistory|  and  |protohistory|Protohistory|  of  |humanity|Homo_Sapiens| . It was preceded by the  |Stone_Age|Stone_Age|   and the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| . The concept has been mostly applied to  |Europe|Iron_Age_Europe|  and the  |Ancient_Near_East|Ancient_Near_East| , and, by analogy, also to other parts of the  |Old_World|Old_World| .     The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration. It is defined by archaeological convention, and the mere presence of some  |cast|Cast_Iron|  or  |wrought_iron|Wrought_Iron|  is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture; rather, the Iron Age begins locally when the production of iron or  |steel|Steel|  has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their  |bronze|Bronze|  equivalents become widespread. Milisauskas, Sarunas , European Prehistory: A Survey, 2002, Springer, , 9780306467936,  For example,  |Tutankhamuns_meteoric_iron_dagger|Tutankhamuns_Meteoric_Iron_Dagger|  comes from the Bronze Age. In the  |Ancient_Near_East|Ancient_Near_East| , this transition takes place in the wake of the so-called  |Bronze_Age_collapse|Bronze_Age_Collapse| , in the 12th century BC. The technology soon spread throughout the  |Mediterranean_Basin|Mediterranean_Basin|  region and to  |South_Asia|South_Asia| . Its further spread to  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| ,  |Eastern_Europe|Eastern_Europe| , and  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe|  is somewhat delayed, and  |Northern_Europe|Northern_Europe|  is reached still later, by about 500 BC.     The Iron Age is taken to end, also by convention, with the beginning of the  |historiographical_record|Historiographical_Record| .   This usually does not represent a clear break in the archaeological record; for the Ancient Near East the establishment of the  |Achaemenid_Empire|Achaemenid_Empire|  c. 550 BC  is usually taken as a cut-off date, and in Central and Western Europe the  |Roman_conquests|Roman_Empire|  of the 1st century BC serve as marking for the end of the Iron Age. The  |Germanic_Iron_Age|Germanic_Iron_Age|  of Scandinavia is taken to end c. 800 AD, with the beginning of the  |Viking_Age|Viking_Age| .     In South Asia , the Iron Age is taken to begin with the ironworking  |Painted_Gray_Ware|Painted_Gray_Ware|  culture and to end with the reign of  |Ashoka|Ashoka|  . The use of the term Iron Age in the archaeology of South, East and Southeast Asia is more recent, and less common, than for western Eurasia; at least in China prehistory had ended before iron-working arrived, so the term is infrequently used. The  |Sahel|Sahel|   and  |Sub_Saharan_Africa|Sub_Saharan_Africa|  are outside of the three-age system, there being no Bronze Age, but the term Iron Age is sometimes used in reference to early cultures practicing ironworking such as the  |Nok_culture|Nok_Culture|  of Nigeria.            The three-age system was introduced in the first half of the 19th century for the archaeology of Europe in particular, and by the later 19th century expanded to the archaeology of the Ancient Near East. Its name harks back to the mythological  |Ages_of_Man|Ages_Of_Man|  of  |Hesiod|Hesiod| . As an archaeological era it was first introduced for Scandinavia by  |Christian_Jürgensen_Thomsen|Christian_Jürgensen_Thomsen|  in the 1830s. By the 1860s, it was embraced as a useful division of the earliest history of mankind in general  .
