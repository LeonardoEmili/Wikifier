                     is a 1996  |action_game|Action_Game|  developed by  |Sonic_Team|Sonic_Team|  and published by  |Sega|Sega|  for the  |Sega_Saturn|Sega_Saturn| . The story follows teenagers Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, who enter Nightopia, a  |dream_world|Dream_World|  where all dreams take place. With the help of Nights, an exiled Nightmaren , they begin a journey to stop the evil ruler Wizeman from destroying Nightopia and consequently the real world. Players control Nights flying through Elliot and Clariss dreams to gather enough energy to defeat Wizeman and save Nightopia. The game is presented in  |3D|3D_Computer_Graphics|  and imposes  |time_limits|Time_Limit|  on every level, in which the player must accumulate points to proceed.     Development began after the release of  Sonic & Knuckles  in 1994, although the concept originated during the development of  Sonic the Hedgehog 2  two years prior. Development was led by Sonic Team veterans  |Yuji_Naka|Yuji_Naka| ,  |Naoto_Ohshima|Naoto_Ohshima| , and  |Takashi_Iizuka|Takashi_Iizuka| . Naka began the project with the main idea revolving around flight, and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that could fly like a bird. Ohshima designed Nights as an  |androgynous|Androgynous|  character. The team conducted research on dreaming and  |REM_sleep|Rem_Sleep| , and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts  |Carl_Jung|Carl_Jung|  and  |Sigmund_Freud|Sigmund_Freud| . An analogue controller, the Saturn 3D controller, was designed alongside the game and included with some retail copies.     Nights into Dreams received acclaim for its graphics, gameplay, soundtrack, and atmosphere. It has appeared on several lists of the  |greatest_games_of_all_time|List_Of_Video_Games_Considered_The_Best| . An abbreviated Christmas-themed version, Christmas Nights, was released in December 1996. The game was  |ported|Porting|  to the  |PlayStation_2|Playstation_2|  in 2008 in Japan and a high-definition version was released worldwide for  |PlayStation_3|Playstation_3| ,  |Xbox_360|Xbox_360| , and  |Windows|Windows|  in 2012. A sequel,  Nights: Journey of Dreams , was released for the  |Wii|Wii|  in 2007.          Nights into Dreams is split into seven  |levels|Level| , referred to as Dreams . The levels are distributed between the two teenage characters: three are unique to Claris, three to Elliot, and each play through an identical final seventh level, Twin Seeds . Initially, only Claris Spring Valley and Elliots Splash Garden levels are available, and successful completion of one of these unlocks the next level in that characters path. Previously completed stages may be revisited to improve the players  |high_scores|High_Score| ; a grade between A and F is given to the player upon completion, but a C grade in all the selected characters levels must be achieved to unlock the relevant Twin Seeds stage for that character. Points are accumulated depending on how fast the player completes a level, and extra points are awarded when the player flies through rings.     Each level is split up into four Mares set in Nightopia and a  |boss_fight|Boss_Fight|  which takes place in Nightmare. In each level, players initially control Claris or Elliot, who immediately have their Ideyas of hope, wisdom, intelligence and purity stolen from them by Wizemans minions, leaving behind only their Ideya of courage.  The goal of each Mare is to recover one of the stolen Ideya by collecting 20 blue chips and delivering them to the cage holding the Ideyas, which overloads and releases the orb it holds. If the player walks around the landscape for too long, they are pursued by a sentient  |alarm_clock|Alarm_Clock|  which awakens the character and end the level if it comes into contact with the player.  The majority of the gameplay centres on flying sequences, which are triggered by walking into the Ideya Palace near the start of each level so that the character merges with the imprisoned Nights. Once the flying sequence is initiated, the time limit begins.      In the flying sections, the player controls Nights flight along a predetermined route through each Mare, resembling that of a 2D  |platformer|Platform_Game| . The player has only a limited period of time available before Nights falls to the ground and transforms back into Claris or Elliot, and each collision with an enemy subtracts five seconds from the time remaining.  The players time is replenished each time they return an Ideya to the Ideya Palace. While flying, Nights can use a Drill Dash to travel faster, as well as defeat certain reverie enemies scattered throughout the level.  Grabbing onto certain enemies causes Nights to spin around, which launches both Nights and the enemy in the direction the boost was initiated. Various acrobatic manoeuvres can be performed, including the Paraloop , whereby flying around in a complete circle and connecting the trail of stars left in Nights wake causes any items within the loop to be attracted towards Nights. The game features a  |combo|Combo|  system known as Linking , whereby actions such as collecting items and flying through rings are worth more points when performed in quick succession.  |Power_ups|Power_Up|  may be gained by flying through several predetermined rings, indicated by a bonus barrel. The power-ups include a speed boost, point multiplier and an air pocket.     The player receives a grade based on their score at the end of each Mare, and an overall grade for the level after clearing all four Mares. Nights is then transported to Nightmare for a boss fight against one of Wizemans Level Two Nightmarens. Each boss fight has a time limit, and the game ends if the player runs out of time during the battle. Upon winning the boss fight, the player is awarded a score multiplier based on how quickly the boss was defeated, which is then applied to the score earned in the Nightopia section to produce the players final score for that Dream. The game also features a  |multiplayer|Multiplayer_Video_Game|  mode, which allows two players to battle each other by using a  |splitscreen|Split_Screen| . One player controls Nights, whereas the other controls Reala. The winner is determined by the first player to defeat the other, which is accomplished by hitting or paralooping the other player three times.     The game features an  |artificial_life|Artificial_Life|  system known as A-Life ,  which involves entities called Nightopians and keeps track of their moods. It is possible to have them  |mate|Mating|  with other Nightopians, which creates hybrids known as Superpians .   The more the game is played, the more inhabitants appear, and environmental features and aesthetics change. The A-Life system features an evolving music engine, allowing  |tempo|Tempo| ,  |pitch|Pitch| , and  |melody|Melody|  to alter depending on the state of Nightopians within the level.  The feature runs from the Sega Saturns internal clock, which alters features in the A-Life system depending on the time.           Every night, all human dreams are played out in Nightopia and Nightmare, the two parts of the  |dream_world|Dream_World| . In Nightopia, distinct aspects of dreamers personalities are represented by luminous coloured spheres known as Ideya . The evil ruler of Nightmare, Wizeman the Wicked, is stealing this dream energy from sleeping visitors in order to gather power and take control of Nightopia and eventually the real world. To achieve this, he creates five beings called Nightmaren :  |jester|Jester| -like, flight-capable beings, which include Jackle, Clawz, Gulpo, Gillwing and Puffy as well as many minor maren. He also creates two Level One Nightmaren:  |Nights|Nights|  and Reala. However, Nights rebels against Wizemans plans, and is punished by being imprisoned inside an Ideya palace, a container for dreamers Ideya.        One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two teenagers from the city of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends. He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court. Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage. She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds. Standing in front of the judges, she is overcome by  |stage_fright|Stage_Fright|  and does not perform well, which causes her to lose all hopes of getting the role. When they go to sleep that night, both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events. They escape into Nightopia and find that they both possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage, the only type that Wizeman cannot steal.     Once in Nightopia, they discover and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin a journey to stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia and the world of Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a  |billboard|Billboard| . Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.            The concept for Nights originated during the development of  Sonic the Hedgehog 2  in 1992, but development did not begin until after the release of  Sonic & Knuckles  in late 1994.  Programming began in April 1995 and total development spanned six months. The development team consisted of staff who worked on previous Sonic the Hedgehog games:  |Yuji_Naka|Yuji_Naka|  was lead programmer and producer, while  |Naoto_Ohshima|Naoto_Ohshima|  and  |Takashi_Iizuka|Takashi_Iizuka|  were director and lead designer, respectively.  Naka and Ohshima felt they had spent enough time with the Sonic franchise and were eager to work on new concepts.  According to Naka, the initial development team consisted of seven people, and grew to 20 as programmers arrived.      Sonic the Hedgehog creator and project director Ohshima created the character of Nights based on his inspirations from travelling around Europe and western Asia. He came to the conclusion that the character should resemble an angel and fly like a bird. Naka originally intended to make Nights into Dreams a slow-paced game, but as development progressed the gameplay pace gradually increased, in similar vein to Sonic games. The initial concept envisioned the flying character in a rendered 2D sprite art, with side-scrolling features similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. The team were hesitant to switch the game from 2D to 3D, as Naka was sceptical that appealing characters could be created with polygons, in contrast to traditional pixel sprites, which  |Sonic_Teams|Sonic_Team|  designers found more expressive . According to Izuka, the game design and story took two years to finalise. The games difficulty was designed with the intent that young and inexperienced players would be able to complete the game, while more experienced players would be compelled by the replay value.      The game was developed using  |Silicon_Graphics|Silicon_Graphics|  workstations for graphical designs and Sega Saturn emulators running on  |Hewlett_Packard|Hewlett_Packard|  machines for programming. There were problems during early stages of development because of a lack of games to use as reference; the team had to redesign the Spring Valley level numerous times and build everything from scratch . The team used the Sega Graphics Library operating system, said by many developers to make programming for the Saturn dramatically easier, only sparingly, instead creating the game almost entirely with custom libraries.  Because the Sonic Team offices did not include soundproof studios, team members recorded sound effects at night. According to Naka, every phrase in the game has a meaning; for example, abayo is Japanese slang for goodbye . The team felt that the global market would be less resistant to a game featuring full 3D CGI cut scenes than 2D  |anime|Anime| . Norihiro Nishiyama, the designer of the in-game movies, felt that the 3D cutscenes were a good method to show the different concepts of dreaming and waking up. Naka said that the movies incorporate realism to make it more difficult for the player to disambiguate the boundary between dreams and reality.     The development took longer than expected because of the teams inexperience with Saturn hardware and uncertainty about using the full 560 megabyte space on the CD-ROM. The team initially thought that the game would consume around 100 megabytes of data, and at one point considered releasing it on two separate discs. Iizuka said that the most difficult part of development was finding a way of handling the contradiction of using 2D sidescroller controls in a fully 3D game. Naka limited the games flying mechanic to invisible 2D tracks because early  |beta|Beta_Release|  testing revealed that the game was too difficult to play in full 3D. The standard Saturn gamepad was found to be insufficient to control Nights in flight, so the team developed the Saturn analog controller to be used with the game. It took about six months to develop, and the team went through a large number of ideas for alternate controllers, including one shaped like a Nights doll.     Iizuka said that the game was inspired by anime and  |Cirque_du_Soleils|Cirque_Du_Soleil|  Mystère theatrical performance.  The development team researched dream sequences and  |REM_sleep|Rem_Sleep| , including the works of the psychoanalysts  |Carl_Jung|Carl_Jung| ,  |Sigmund_Freud|Sigmund_Freud|  and Friedrich Holtz. Iizuka analysed Jungs theories of dream archetypes and spent a considerable amount of time studying dreams and theories associated with them. Naka said that the main protagonist, Nights, is reflective of Jungs analytical  |shadow|Shadow|  theory, whereas the two central characters, Claris and Elliot, were inspired by Jungs  |animus_and_anima|Animus_And_Anima| .          Nights into Dreams was introduced alongside an optional  |gamepad|Gamepad| , the Saturn 3D controller, included with some copies of the game.  It features an  |analogue_stick|Analogue_Stick|  and analogue triggers designed specifically for the game  to make movement easier. Sonic Team noted the successful twinning of the  |Nintendo_64_controller|Nintendo_64_Controller|  with  Super Mario 64  , and realised that the default Saturn controller was better suited to arcade games than Nights into Dreams. During development, director  |Steven_Spielberg|Steven_Spielberg|  visited the Sonic Team studio and became the first person outside the team to play the game. Naka asked him to use an experimental version of the Saturn 3D controller, and it was jokingly referred to as the Spielberg controller throughout development. Because the Nights character was testing very young in  |focus_groups|Focus_Group| , Sega used a nighttime scene for the cover art to give the game a more mature look.  The game was marketed with a budget of $10  million, which included television and print advertisements in the United States.  In the US, the game was advertised with the  |slogan|Advertising_Slogan|  Prepare to fly.          Christmas Nights    , or Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams..., is a Christmas-themed two-level game of Nights into Dreams that was released in December 1996.  It was introduced in Japan as part of a Christmas Sega Saturn bundle; elsewhere it was given away with the purchase of Saturn games such as  Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition  or issues of Sega Saturn Magazine and  Next Generation Magazine . In the United Kingdom, Christmas Nights was not included with the Sega Saturn Magazine until December 1997. In a 2007 interview, Iizuka stated that Christmas Nights was created to increase Saturn console sales. Development began in July 1996 and took three to four months, according to Naka.     Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris during the holiday season following their adventures with Nights. Realizing that the Christmas Star is missing from the Twin Seeds  |Christmas_tree|Christmas_Tree| , the pair travel to Nightopia to find it, where they reunite with Nights and retrieve the Christmas Star from Gillwings lair.     Christmas Nights contains the full version of Claris Spring Valley dream level from Nights into Dreams, playable as both Claris and Elliot. The Saturns internal clock changes elements according to the date and time:  December activates Christmas Nights mode, replacing item boxes with Christmas presents, greenery with snow and gumdrops,  rings with wreaths,  and Ideya captures with Christmas trees; Nightopians wear  |elf|Elf|  costumes, and the music is replaced with a rendition of  |Jingle_Bells|Jingle_Bells|  and an  |a_cappella|A_Cappella|  version of the Nights theme song. During the Winter Nights period, the Spring Valley weather changes according to the hour. Other changes apply on New Years Day; on  |April_Fools_Day|April_Fools_Day| , Reala replaces Nights as the playable character.      The game features several unlockable bonuses, such as being able to play the games soundtrack, observe the status of the A-life system, experiment with the games music mixer,  |time_attack|Time_Attack|  one Mare,  or play as Segas mascot  |Sonic_the_Hedgehog|Sonic_The_Hedgehog|  in the minigame Sonic the Hedgehog: Into Dreams. Sonic may only play through Spring Valley on foot, and must defeat the boss: an inflatable  |Dr_Robotnik|Dr_Robotnik| . The music is a remixed version of Final Fever , the final boss battle music from the Japanese and European version of  Sonic CD  .  In the HD version of Nights, the Christmas Nights content is playable after the game has been cleared once.           Sonic Team made a prototype Saturn sequel with the title Air Nights for the Saturn, and began development for the Dreamcast.  In August 1999, Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development;  by December 2000, however, it had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel,  but later said he was interested in using Nights into Dreams to reinforce Segas identity .  Aside from a  |handheld_electronic_game|Handheld_Electronic_Game|  released by  |Tiger_Electronics|Tiger_Electronics|   and small  |minigames|Minigames|  featured in several Sega games, no sequel was released for a Sega console.     On 1 April 2007, a sequel,  Nights: Journey of Dreams , was announced for the  |Wii|Wii| .   The game was first previewed on Portuguese publication Maxi Consolas, after the release of short reveals from the  Official Nintendo Magazine  and Game Reactor.  The sequel is a Wii exclusive, making use of the  |Wii_Remote|Wii_Remote| . The gameplay involves the use of various masks,  and features a multiplayer mode for two players in addition to  |Nintendo_Wi_Fi_Connection|Nintendo_Wi_Fi_Connection|  online functions.  The game was developed by  |Sega_Studio_USA|Sega_Studio_Usa| , with Iizuka, one of the designers of the original game, serving as producer.  It was released in Japan and the United States in December 2007, and in Europe and Australia on 18 January 2008.  In 2010, Iizuka said that he would be interested in making a third Nights into Dreams game.

In February 1998,  |Archie_Comics|Archie_Comics|  adapted Nights into Dreams into a three-issue comic book  |miniseries|Miniseries|   to test whether a Nights comic would sell well in North America.  The first miniseries was loosely based on the game, with Nights identified as male despite the characters androgynous design. The company later released a second three-issue miniseries, continuing the story of the first, but the series did not gain enough sales to warrant an ongoing series. It was later added to a list of guest franchises featured in Archie Comics Worlds Unite crossover between its  Sonic the Hedgehog  and  Mega Man  comics.
