There are over 1000 known compositions by Bach. Nearly all of them are listed in the  , which is the best known and most widely used catalogue of Bachs compositions.          The earliest lists of Bachs compositions are given by  |his_biographers|Biographies_Of_Johann_Sebastian_Bach| , starting from  |his_obituary|Bachs_Nekrolog|  which gives a list of instrumental  |works_printed_during_the_composers_lifetime|List_Of_Compositions_By_Johann_Sebastian_Bach_Printed_During_His_Lifetime|  , followed by a list which groups other types of compositions he wrote. The  |first_separately_published_biography_of_the_composer|Johann_Sebastian_Bach:_His_Life,_Art,_And_Work| , by  |Johann_Nikolaus_Forkel|Johann_Nikolaus_Forkel| , follows the same setup: its ninth chapter first lists printed works , followed by a rough overview of the unpublished ones. In the first half of the 19th century more works were published, so the next biographies had more elaborate appendices listing printed works, referring to these works by publisher, and the number or page number given to the works in these publications. So, for example, the  |Prelude_and_Fugue_in_E-flat_major|Prelude_And_Fugue_In_E_Flat_Major,_Bwv_552|  can be indicated as  |C._F._Peters|C._F._Peters|  Vol. III No. 1 , or any of the variants          In the second half of the 19th century the  |Bach-Gesellschaft|Bach-Gesellschaft|  published all of Bachs works in around 50 volumes, the so-called  |Bach_Gesellschaft_Ausgabe|Bach_Gesellschaft_Ausgabe|  .  This offered a unique identification of all of Bachs known works, a system that was quickly adopted, for instance by the biographers:  |Philipp_Spitta|Philipp_Spitta|  used it complementarily to the Peters edition numbering for the BG volumes that had appeared when he was writing  |his_Bach-biography|Spittas_Johann_Sebastian_Bach|  in the second half of the 19th century , and Terry used it in the third Appendix to his 20th-century translation of Forkels biography.  |Johann_Nikolaus_Forkel|Johann_Nikolaus_Forkel|  translated by  |Charles_Sanford_Terry|Charles_Sanford_Terry| .  New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe; London: Constable. 1920.      But there was still a lot of confusion: some authors preferred to list Bachs works according to  |Novellos|Novello_&_Co|  editions, or  |Augeners|Augener_&_Co.| , or  |Schirmers|G._Schirmer_Inc.| ,... giving rise to various conversion tables at the end of books on Bachs compositions .       In 1900 the BG published its last volume, and dissolved itself, as its primary goal, publishing all of Bachs known works, was accomplished. The BG was succeeded by the  |Neue_Bachgesellschaft|Neue_Bachgesellschaft|  , with a new set of goals . Occasionally however the NBG published newly discovered works, or variants not published in the BGA. For instance the 1740s version of  O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht  was published in NBG XVII 1 in 1916 .          In 1950 the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis was published, allocating a unique number to every known composition by Bach.  |Wolfgang_Schmieder|Wolfgang_Schmieder| , the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following BG for the collation :  |Wolfgang_Schmieder|Wolfgang_Schmieder|  . Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach. Leipzig: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1950. Unaltered up unto its eighth printing in 1986.       |Kantaten|Bwv_Chapter_1| , BWV 1–224    |Motetten|Bwv_Chapter_2| , BWV 225–231    |Messen,_Messensätze,_Magnificat|Bwv_Chapter_3| , BWV 232–243    |Passionen,_Oratorien|Bwv_Chapter_4| , BWV 244–249    |Vierstimmige_Choräle|Bwv_Chapter_5| , BWV 250–438    |Lieder,_Arien,_Quodlibet|Bwv_Chapter_6| , BWV 439–524    |Werke_für_Orgel|Bwv_Chapter_7| , BWV 525–771    |Werke_für_Klavier|Bwv_Chapter_8| , BWV 772–994    |Werke_für_Laute|Bwv_Chapter_9| , BWV 995–1000    |Kammermusik|Bwv_Chapter_10| , BWV 1001–1040    |Orchesterwerke|Bwv_Chapter_11| , BWV 1041–1071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos and Overtures    |Kanons|Bwv_Chapter_12| , BWV 1072–1078    |Musikalisches_Opfer,_Kunst_der_Fuge|Bwv_Chapter_13| , BWV 1079–1080     For instance, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major now became  |BWV_552|Bwv_552| , situated in the range of the works for organ. In contrast to other catalogues such as the  |Köchel_catalogue|Köchel_Catalogue|  for  |Mozarts|Mozart|  compositions there is no attempt at chronological organization in the BWV numbering, for instance  |BWV_992|Bwv_992|  is an early composition by Bach. Exceptionally BWV numbers are also indicated as Schmieder numbers .  at      Another consequence of the ordering principles of the BWV was that it tore known collections apart, for instance  |Clavier-Übung_III|Clavier-Übung_Iii|  was partly in the organ compositions range , with the four duets listed among the keyboard compositions .       The Anhang , i.e. Appendix, of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:    |I_–_lost_works,_or_works_of_which_only_a_tiny_fraction_had_survived|Bwv_Anhang| |II_–_works_of_dubious_authenticity|Bwv_Anhang_Ii| |III_–_works_that_were_once_attributed_to_Bach,_but_for_which_it_had_been_established_they_were_not_composed_by_him|Bwv_Anhang_Iii|    Within each section of the Anhang the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.          Schmieder published the BWVs second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the Anhang. A strict numerical collation was abandoned to insert additions, or when for another reason compositions were regrouped. For example,  |BWV_11|Bwv_11| , formerly listed as a Cantata, was moved to the fourth chapter of the main catalogue as an Oratorio. Rather than renumbering a composition, an arrow indicated where the composition was inserted:  meaning BWV  11, inserted after BWV  249b . Similarly,  meant  |BWV_1083|Bwv_&_Nbsp;1083| , inserted after BWV  243a . Also authenticity discriminations, based on new research, could lead to such repositionings within the catalogue, e.g.  became  indicating it was now considered a spurious work. Thematisch-systematisches Verzeichnis der musikalischen Werke von Johann Sebastian Bach: Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, überarbeitete und erweiterte Ausgabe. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1990.  –      In 1998  |Alfred_Dürr|Alfred_Dürr|  and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV 2a , contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.  |Alfred_Dürr|Alfred_Dürr| , Yoshitake Kobayashi , Kirsten Beißwenger. Bach Werke Verzeichnis: Kleine Ausgabe, nach der von Wolfgang Schmieder vorgelegten 2. Ausgabe. Preface in English and German. Wiesbaden: Breitkopf & Härtel, 1998.  –      New additions to BWV 2 /BWV 2a included:    |BWV_1081–1126|Additions_To_The_Main_Catalogue| |BWV_Anh._190–213|Additions_To_The_Anhang|      A few exceptions to the principle that compositions werent renumbered were when a composition from the Anhang could be recovered and/or authenticated as Bachs, so that it deserved a place in the main catalogue, in which case it was given a number above 1080. So, for example, BWV  Anh.  205 → BWV  1121 .  at      Other renumberings and additional numbers involved alternative or earlier versions of basically the same composition, which were indicated by adding a lower case letter to the BWV number. Examples:    |BWV_243a|Bwv_243A|  major version of the 1733 Magnificat in D major  |BWV_243|Bwv_243| |BWV_1071|Bwv_1071|  renumbered to  |BWV_1046a|Bwv_1046A| |BWV_Anh._198|Bwv_Anh._198|  renumbered to  |BWV_149/1a|Bwv_149/1A|       Some versions were completely removed from the catalogue, e.g.  |BWV_655b|Bwv_655B|  and  |c|Bwv_655C|      Slashes indicate movements: e.g.  |BWV_149|Bwv_&_Nbsp;149| /1 indicates the first movement of the Cantata BWV  149. Another example: the  |Agnus_Dei|Mass_In_B_Minor_Structureagnus_Dei|  of the  |Mass_in_B_minor|Mass_In_B_Minor|  can be indicated as BWV  232/22 , or alternatively as BWV  232 IV /4 .        |Numbers_above_BWV_1126|21St_Century|  were added in the 21st century.       An upper case R added to a BWV number indicates a  |reconstructed_version|Reconstructions| , that is a conjectured earlier version of a known composition. One of such reconstructions, the Concerto for oboe and violin, as published in NBA VII/7 p.  75, based on the double harpsichord concerto BWV 1060, is known as  |BWV_1060R|Bwv_1060R| .       As of mid-2018 the  |Bach_digital|Bd|  website started to implement the new numbers of the 3rd edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, which had been announced for publication in that year.  at  |Bach_Archive|Bach_Archive|  website For example, the Leipzig version of the  |Christ_lag_in_Todes_Banden_cantata|Bwv_4|  used to be BWV  4 in previous versions of the catalogue, and, in BWV 3 , has become  |BWV_4.2|Bwv_&_Nbsp;4.2| . Work  at the  |Bach_digital|Bd|  website, as updated 6 July 2018.          In the meantime, the  |New_Bach_Edition|New_Bach_Edition|  was being published,  at  offering a new system to refer to Bachs works, e.g. , which is Series  IV, Volume  4, p.  2 and p.  105 , for BWV  552.          Some years after the completion of the NBA in 2007 its publisher  |Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter|  joined with the  |Bach_Archive|Bach_Archive|  again to publish revised editions of some of Bachs scores. These revised editions, aligning with the NBA editions , but outside that group of publications, were published under the name Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works – Revised Edition , in short: New Bach Edition – Revised , abbreviated as NBArev. Where the original NBA editions were exclusively in German, the volumes of the Revised series have their introductions both in German and English. Its first volume, NBArev 1, was a new edition of the  |Mass_in_B_minor|Mass_In_B_Minor| , appearing in 2010.  at the  |Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter|  website       The Bach Compendium , a catalogue covering Bachs vocal works, was published in 1985.  |Hans-Joachim_Schulze|Hans-Joachim_Schulze|  and  |Christoph_Wolff|Christoph_Wolff| . Bach Compendium: Analytisch-bibliographisches Repertorium der Werke Johann Sebastian Bachs, Vol. 1 . Leipzig 1985ff. Occasionally works that have no BWV number can be identified by their BC number, e.g. BC  C  8 for  |Der_Gerechte_kömmt_um|Der_Gerechte_Kömmt_Um|  an arrangement attributed to Bach on stylistic grounds, however unmentioned in the BWV.  at        Bachs Notenbibliothek is a list of works Bach had at his disposition. Works of other composers which were arranged by Bach and/or which he copied for performance usually have a BNB number. Kirsten Beißwenger . Johann Sebastian Bachs Notenbibliothek. Kassel: Bärenreiter.        The  |Berlin_State_Library|Berlin_State_Library|  holds an important collection of composition manuscripts relating to Bach. Some versions of works are best known by their principal manuscript in the SBB, for instance  , or according to the abbreviations used at the Bach-digital website .               Apart from indicating his first published keyboard composition as Opus 1, Bach didnt use  |opus_numbers|Opus_Number| , so Bachs works cant be listed by opus number. Lists following publication chronologies are for example implied in the first list in Bachs obituary, and BG numbers – overall lists covering all of Bachs compositions in order of first publication are however not a way Bachs compositions are usually presented.     Listing Bachs works according to their time of composition cant be done comprehensively: for many works the period in which they were composed is a very wide range. For Bachs larger vocal works research has led to some more or less generally accepted chronologies, covering most of these works: a catalogue in this sense is Philippe Zwangs list giving a chronological number to the cantatas BWV 1–215 and 248–249.  at  This list was published in 1982 as Guide pratique des cantates de Bach in Paris, . A revised edition was published in 2005 .          Various catalogues with works by other composers have intersections with collections of works associated with Bach:  at    ;BR-WFB BR :  |Bach-Repertorium|Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bachworks_List|  numbers for works by  |Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach|Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach| , e.g. BWV  970 BR  A49   :Other BRs:   :BR-CPEB |Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach|Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach|    :BR-JCFB |Johann_Christoph_Friedrich_Bach|Johann_Christoph_Friedrich_Bach|    ;Fk F :  |Falck_catalogue|Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bachworks_List|  numbers for works by  |Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach|Wilhelm_Friedemann_Bach| , e.g. BWV  970 F  25/2   ;H :  |Helm|List_Of_Compositions_By_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach|  numbers for works by  |Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach|Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach| , e.g. BWV  1036 H  569   ;HWV : Works by  |George_Frideric_Handel|George_Frideric_Handel| , e.g. BWV  Anh.  106  |HWV|Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|   605   ;TWV : Compositions by  |Georg_Philipp_Telemann|Georg_Philipp_Telemann| , e.g. BWV  824  |TWV|Georg_Philipp_Telemannpartial_List_Of_Works|   32:14   ;Warb W :  |Warburton|List_Of_Compositions_By_Johann_Christian_Bach|  numbers for works by  |Johann_Christian_Bach|Johann_Christian_Bach| , e.g.  W  A22    ;Wq :  |Wotquenne|List_Of_Compositions_By_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach|  numbers for works by  |Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach|Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach| , e.g. BWV  1036 Wq  145       There are over 1500 works that feature in a catalogue of works by Bach, like the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, and/or in a collection of works associated with Bach . Of these around a thousand are original compositions by Bach, that is: more than a mere copy or transcription of an earlier work by himself or another composer.           :See also  Legend to the table  below        |Mass_in_B_minor|Mass_In_B_Minor| ;  |Kyrie–Gloria_Masses|Kyrie–Gloria_Masses,_Bwv_233–236| ; separate Mass movements  St Matthew Passion ;  St John Passion ;  St Mark Passion ;  St Luke Passion  Christmas Oratorio ;  Easter Oratorio   |tributed_to_Keiserattributed_to_Keis|Tributed_To_Keiserattributed_To_Keis|  not set by Bach, apart from using some parts of this text in his St Matthew Passionusually for SATB choirmost prominently in the  |chorale_cantatas|Chorale_Cantata|   separate   doubtfuldoubtfulWeddingincompletestrophic aria rediscovered in 2005                .
