              The  |mythology|Mythology|  of pre-Christian  |Ireland|Ireland|  was preserved in a highly-conservative oral tradition. With the arrival of Christianity, the first manuscripts were written in Ireland, preserving many of these tales in  |medieval_Irish_literature|Medieval_Irish_Literature| . Though the Christian influence is also seen in these manuscripts, this literature represents the most extensive and best preserved of all the branches of  |Celtic_mythology|Celtic_Mythology| . Although many of the manuscripts have not survived and much more material was probably never committed to writing, there is enough remaining to enable the identification of distinct, if overlapping, cycles: the  |Mythological_Cycle|Mythological_Cycle| , the  |Ulster_Cycle|Ulster_Cycle| , the  |Fenian_Cycle|Fenian_Cycle|  and the  |Historical_Cycle|Historical_Cycle| . There are also a number of extant mythological texts that do not fit into any of the cycles, and many recorded  |folk_tales|Folklore|  that continued as the oral tradition ran parallel to the manuscript tradition which, while not strictly mythological, feature personages from one or more of these four cycles.     Today some of the best known tales are of  |Tír_na_nÓg|Tír_Na_Nóg| ,  |Fionn_MacCumhaill|Fionn_Mac_Cumhaill| ,  |Na_Fianna|Fianna| ,  |The_Aos_Sí_/_Aes_Sídhe|Aos_Sí| ,  |Sétanta|Cú_Chulainn| ,  |The_Tuatha_Dé_Danann|Tuatha_Dé_Danann| , the  |Children_of_Lir|Children_Of_Lir| ,  |Táin_Bó_Cúailnge|Táin_Bó_Cúailnge|  &  |the_Salmon_of_Knowledge|Salmon_Of_Knowledge| .       Depending on the sources, the importance of gods and goddesses in Irish mythology varies. The geographical tales,  |Dindshenchas|Dindsenchas| , emphasize the importance of female divinities and powerful ancestors, while the historical tradition focuses on the colonizers, inventors, or male warriors with the female characters only intervening in episodes.     The primal and ancestral goddesses are connected to the land, the waters, sovereignty, and often seen as the oldest ancestors of the people in the region or nation. They are maternal figures caring for the earth itself as well as their descendants, but also fierce defenders, teachers and warriors. More personalized deities may be connected to cultural qualities such as, in the case of  |Brigid|Brigid| , poetry, smith craft, and healing.  Some of the female figures associated with the  |druids|Druids|  are prophetic, especially when foretelling death and doom.  |Zoomorphism|Zoomorphism|  is an important feature for many Irish deities. Badb Catha, for instance, is the Raven of Battle ,  and in the  Táin Bó Cúailnge ,  |The_Morrígan|The_Morrígan|  changes into an eel, a wolf and a cow.       The Celtic goddesses are not divided by singular qualities such as love goddess , but are more of the nature of well-rounded humans, who have areas of special interests or skills. In this way, they do not correspond directly to other pantheons such as those of the Greeks or Romans.      The mother of the  |Tuatha_Dé_Danann|Tuatha_Dé_Danann|  is generally considered to be  |Anu|Anu|  or  |Danu|Danu| .     A number of the goddesses are associated with sacred sites where seasonal festivals are held. They include  |Macha|Macha|  of  |Eamhain_Mhacha|Eamhain_Mhacha| ,  |Carman|Carman| , and  |Tailtiu|Tailtiu| , among others.     Warrior Goddesses are often depicted as a triad, and connected with sovereignty and sacred animals. The animals may be associated with carnage, such as wolves and crows, or the abundance of the land, such as cattle. They guard the battlefield and those who do battle, and according to the stories in the  Táin Bó Cúailnge , some of these goddesses may be the instigators and directors of the entire war themselves. Kinsella, Thomas. The Tain. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1970. . The main goddesses of battle are  |The_Morrígan|The_Morrígan| ,  |Macha|Macha| , and  |Badb|Badb| .  Other warrior women are seen in the role of training warriors in the Fianna bands, such as  |Liath_Luachra|Liath_Luachra| , one of the women who trained the hero  |Fionn_mac_Cumhaill|Fionn_Mac_Cumhaill| . Nagy, Joseph Falaky . The Wisdom of the Outlaw - The Boyhood Deeds of Finn in Gaelic Narrative Tradition. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.       The Irish Gods are divided into four main groups. Group one encompasses the older gods of  |Gaul|Gaul|  and Britain. The second group is the main focus of much of the mythology and surrounds the native Irish gods with their homes in burial mounds . The third group are the gods that dwell in the sea and the fourth group includes stories of the Otherworld. The gods that appear most often are  |Dagda|The_Dagda|  and  |Lug|Lugh| . Some scholars have argued that the stories of these gods align with the Greek stories and gods.        |Druids|Druid|  were held in high esteem by the community as religious leaders, teachers, and skilled members of various professions.       Heroes in Irish mythology can be found in two distinct groups. There is the lawful hero who exists within the boundaries of the community, protecting their people from outsiders. Within the kin-group or  túath , heroes are human and gods are not.     The  |Fianna|Fianna|  warrior bands are seen as outsiders, connected with the wilderness, youth, and liminal states. They are considered outsiders who protect the community from other outsiders; though they may winter with a settled community, they spend the summers living wild, training adolescents and providing a space for war-damaged veterans. They live under the authority of their own leaders, or may be somewhat anarchic, and may follow other deities or spirits than the settled communities.        The three main manuscript sources for Irish mythology are the late 11th/early 12th century  Lebor na hUidre  which is in the library of the  |Royal_Irish_Academy|Royal_Irish_Academy| , the early 12th century  Book of Leinster  in the  |Library|Trinity_College_Library,_Dublin|  of  |Trinity_College,_Dublin|Trinity_College,_Dublin| , and the  |Bodleian_Library,_MS_Rawlinson_B_502|Bodleian_Library,_Ms_Rawlinson_B_502|  , housed in the  |Bodleian_Library|Bodleian_Library|  at  |Oxford_University|Oxford_University| . Despite the dates of these sources, most of the material they contain predates their composition. It is the oldest surviving manuscript written entirely in the Irish language.  The stories in this manuscript are a part of the Ulster Cycle of Irish Mythology.     Other important sources include a group of four manuscripts originating in the west of Ireland in the late 14th or early 15th century: The Yellow Book of Lecan , The Great Book of Lecan , and The Book of Ballymote . The first is these is housed in Trinity College as well as three others are in the Royal Academy. The Yellow Book of Lecan is composed of sixteen parts and includes the legends of Fionn Mac Cumhail, selections of legends of Irish Saints, and the earliest known version of the  Táin Bó Cúailnge  . This is one of Europes oldest epics written in a vernacular language. Other 15th-century manuscripts, such as The Book of Fermoy also contain interesting materials, as do such later syncretic works such as  |Geoffrey_Keatings|Geoffrey_Keating|  Foras Feasa ar Éirinn  , particularly as these later compilers and writers may have had access to manuscript sources that have since disappeared.     When using these sources, it is, as always, important to question the impact of the circumstances in which they were produced. Most of the manuscripts were created by Christian  |monks|Monk| , who may well have been torn between the desire to record their native culture and their religious hostility to pagan beliefs resulting in some of the gods being  |euhemerised|Wiktionary:Euhemerize| . Many of the later sources may also have formed part of a propaganda effort designed to create a history for the people of Ireland that could bear comparison with the mythological descent of their British invaders from the founders of Rome that was promulgated by  |Geoffrey_of_Monmouth|Geoffrey_Of_Monmouth|  and others. There was also a tendency to rework Irish genealogies to fit into the known schema of Greek or Biblical genealogy.     It was once unquestioned that medieval Irish literature preserved truly ancient traditions in a form virtually unchanged through centuries of  |oral_tradition|Oral_Tradition|  back to the ancient  |Celts|Celts|  of Europe.  |Kenneth_Jackson|Kenneth_H._Jackson|  famously described the Ulster Cycle as a window on the Iron Age , and Garret Olmsted has attempted to draw parallels between  Táin Bó Cuailnge , the Ulster Cycle epic, and the iconography of the  |Gundestrup_Cauldron|Gundestrup_Cauldron| . However, this nativist position has been challenged by revisionist scholars who believe that much of it was created in Christian times in deliberate imitation of the  |epics|Epic_Poetry|  of  |classical_literature|Classical_Literature|  that came with  |Latin|Latin|  learning. The revisionists would indicate passages apparently influenced by the  |Iliad|Iliad|  in Táin Bó Cuailnge, and the existence of Togail Troí, an Irish adaptation of  |Dares_Phrygius|Dares_Phrygius|  De excidio Troiae historia, found in the Book of Leinster, and note that the material culture of the stories is generally closer to the time of the stories composition than to the distant past. A consensus has emerged which encourages the critical reading of the material.          The  |Mythological_Cycle|Mythological_Cycle| , comprising stories of the former gods and origins of the Irish, is the least well preserved of the four cycles. It is about the principal people who invaded and inhabited the island. The people include Cessair and her followers, The Formorians, The Partholinians, The Nemedians, The Firbolgs, the  |Tuatha_Dé_Danann|Tuatha_Dé_Danann| , and the Milesians. The most important sources are the  Metrical Dindshenchas  or Lore of Places and the  Lebor Gabála Érenn  or Book of Invasions. Other manuscripts preserve such mythological tales as  The Dream of Aengus ,  The Wooing Of Étain  and  Cath Maige Tuireadh , The Battle of Magh Tuireadh. One of the best known of all Irish stories, Oidheadh Clainne Lir, or  The Tragedy of the Children of Lir , is also part of this cycle.        Lebor Gabála Érenn is a pseudo-history of Ireland, tracing the ancestry of the Irish back to before  |Noah|Noah| . It tells of a series of invasions or takings of Ireland by a succession of peoples, the fifth of whom was the people known as the  |Tuatha_Dé_Danann|Tuatha_Dé_Danann|  , who were believed to have inhabited the island before the arrival of the  |Gaels|Gaels| , or  |Milesians|Milesians| . They faced opposition from their enemies, the  |Fomorians|Fomorians| , led by  |Balor|Balor|  of the Evil Eye. Balor was eventually slain by  |Lugh_Lámfada|Lugh|  at the second battle of Magh Tuireadh. With the arrival of the Gaels, the Tuatha Dé Danann retired underground to become the  |fairy|Fairy|  people of later myth and legend.     The Metrical Dindshenchas is the great  |onomastics|Onomastic|  work of early Ireland, giving the naming legends of significant places in a sequence of poems. It includes a lot of important information on Mythological Cycle figures and stories, including the Battle of Tailtiu, in which the Tuatha Dé Danann were defeated by the Milesians.     It is important to note that by the Middle Ages the Tuatha Dé Danann were not viewed so much as gods as the shape-shifting magician population of an earlier  |Golden_Age|Golden_Age|  Ireland. Texts such as Lebor Gabála Érenn and Cath Maige Tuireadh present them as kings and heroes of the distant past, complete with death-tales. However, there is considerable evidence, both in the texts and from the wider Celtic world, that they were once considered  |deities|Deity| .     Even after they are displaced as the rulers of Ireland, characters such as  |Lugh|Lugh| , the  |Mórrígan|Mórrígan| ,  |Aengus|Aengus|  and  |Manannán_Mac_Lir|Manannán_Mac_Lir|  appear in stories set centuries later, betraying their immortality. A poem in the Book of Leinster lists many of the Tuatha Dé, but ends Although enumerates them, he does not worship them .  |Goibniu|Goibniu| ,  |Creidhne|Creidhne|  and  |Luchta|Luchta|  are referred to as Trí Dé Dána , and the  |Dagdas|Dagda|  name is interpreted in  |medieval|Medieval|  texts as the good god .  |Nuada|Nuada|  is  |cognate|Cognate|  with the  |British|Prehistoric_Britain|  god  |Nodens|Nodens| ;  |Lugh|Lugh|  is a reflex of the pan- |Celt|Celt| ic deity  |Lugus|Lugus| , the name of whom may indicate Light ;  |Tuireann|Tuireann|  may be related to the  |Gaulish|Gaulish| |Taranis|Taranis| ;  |Ogma|Ogma|  to  |Ogmios|Ogmios| ; the  |Badb|Badb|  to  |Catubodua|Catubodua| .             The  |Ulster_Cycle|Ulster_Cycle|  is traditionally set around the first century CE, and most of the action takes place in the provinces of  |Ulster|Ulster|  and  |Connacht|Connacht| . It consists of a group of heroic tales dealing with the lives of  |Conchobar_mac_Nessa|Conchobar_Mac_Nessa| , king of Ulster, the great hero  |Cú_Chulainn|Cú_Chulainn| , who was the son of Lug , and of their friends, lovers, and enemies. These are the  |Ulaid|Ulaid| , or people of the North-Eastern corner of Ireland and the action of the stories centres round the royal court at  |Emain_Macha|Emain_Macha|  , close to the modern town of  |Armagh|Armagh| . The Ulaid had close links with the Irish colony in  |Scotland|Scotland| , and part of Cú Chulainns training takes place in that colony.     The cycle consists of stories of the births, early lives and training, wooings, battles, feastings, and deaths of the heroes and reflects a warrior society in which warfare consists mainly of single combats and wealth is measured mainly in cattle. These stories are written mainly in prose. The centrepiece of the Ulster Cycle is the  Táin Bó Cúailnge . Other important Ulster Cycle tales include  The Tragic Death of Aifes only Son ,  Bricrius Feast , and  The Destruction of Da Dergas Hostel . The Exile of the Sons of Usnach, better known as the tragedy of  |Deirdre|Deirdre|  and the source of plays by  |John_Millington_Synge|John_Millington_Synge| ,  |William_Butler_Yeats|William_Butler_Yeats| , and  |Vincent_Woods|Vincent_Woods| , is also part of this cycle.     This cycle is, in some respects, close to the mythological cycle. Some of the characters from the latter reappear, and the same sort of shape-shifting magic is much in evidence, side by side with a grim, almost callous realism. While we may suspect a few characters, such as  |Medb|Medb|  or  |Cú_Roí|Cú_Roí| , of once being deities, and Cú Chulainn in particular displays superhuman prowess, the characters are mortal and associated with a specific time and place. If the Mythological Cycle represents a Golden Age, the Ulster Cycle is Irelands  |Heroic_Age|Heroic_Age| .          Like the Ulster Cycle, the  |Fenian_Cycle|Fenian_Cycle| , also referred to as the Ossianic Cycle, is concerned with the deeds of Irish heroes. The stories of the Fenian Cycle appear to be set around the 3rd century and mainly in the provinces of  |Leinster|Leinster|  and  |Munster|Munster| . They differ from the other cycles in the strength of their links with the Gaelic-speaking community in Scotland and there are many extant Fenian texts from that country. They also differ from the Ulster Cycle in that the stories are told mainly in  |verse|Meter|  and that in tone they are nearer to the tradition of romance than the tradition of epic. The stories concern the doings of  |Fionn_mac_Cumhaill|Fionn_Mac_Cumhaill|  and his band of soldiers, the  |Fianna|Fianna| .        The single most important source for the Fenian Cycle is the  Acallam na Senórach  , which is found in two 15th-century manuscripts, the  Book of Lismore  and Laud 610, as well as a 17th-century manuscript from  |Killiney|Killiney| ,  |County_Dublin|County_Dublin| . The text is dated from linguistic evidence to the 12th century. The text records conversations between  |Caílte_mac_Rónáin|Caílte_Mac_Rónáin|  and  |Oisín|Oisín| , the last surviving members of the Fianna, and  |Saint_Patrick|Saint_Patrick| , and consists of about 8,000 lines. The late dates of the manuscripts may reflect a longer oral tradition for the Fenian stories.     The Fianna of the story are divided into the Clann Baiscne, led by Fionn mac Cumhaill , and the Clann Morna, led by his enemy,  |Goll_mac_Morna|Goll_Mac_Morna| . Goll killed Fionns father,  |Cumhal|Cumhal| , in battle and the boy Fionn was brought up in secrecy. As a youth, while being trained in the art of poetry, he accidentally burned his thumb while cooking the Salmon of Knowledge, which allowed him to suck or bite his thumb to receive bursts of stupendous wisdom. He took his place as the leader of his band and numerous tales are told of their adventures. Two of the greatest of the Irish tales,  Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne   and Oisín in Tír na nÓg  form part of the cycle. The Diarmuid and Grainne story, which is one of the few Fenian prose tales, is a probable source of  Tristan and Iseult .     The world of the Fenian Cycle is one in which professional warriors spend their time hunting, fighting, and engaging in adventures in the spirit world. New entrants into the band are expected to be knowledgeable in poetry as well as undergo a number of physical tests or ordeals. Most of the poems are attributed to being composed by Oisín. This cycle creates a bridge between pre-Christian and Christian times.          It was part of the duty of the medieval Irish bards, or court  |poets|Irish_Poetry| , to record the history of the family and the genealogy of the king they served. This they did in poems that blended the mythological and the historical to a greater or lesser degree. The resulting stories form what has come to be known as the  |Historical_Cycle|Historical_Cycle|  or Cycles of the Kings, or more correctly Cycles, as there are a number of independent groupings.     The kings that are included range from the almost entirely mythological  |Labraid_Loingsech|Labraid_Loingsech| , who allegedly became High King of Ireland around 431 BC, to the entirely historical  |Brian_Boru|Brian_Boru| . However, the greatest glory of the Historical Cycle is the  Buile Shuibhne  , a 12th-century tale told in verse and prose. Suibhne, king of  |Dál_nAraidi|Dál_Naraidi| , was cursed by St Ronan and became a kind of half-man, half bird, condemned to live out his life in the woods, fleeing from his human companions. The story has captured the imaginations of contemporary Irish poets and has been translated by  |Trevor_Joyce|Trevor_Joyce|  and  |Seamus_Heaney|Seamus_Heaney| .           The adventures, or  echtrae , are a group of stories of visits to the  |Irish_Other_World|Celtic_Otherworld|  . The most famous, Oisin in Tir na nÓg belongs to the Fenian Cycle, but several free-standing adventures survive, including The Adventure of Conle,  The Voyage of Bran mac Ferbail , and The Adventure of Lóegaire .       The voyages, or  immrama , are tales of sea journeys and the wonders seen on them that may have resulted from the combination of the experiences of fishermen combined and the Other World elements that inform the adventures. Of the seven immrama mentioned in the manuscripts, only three have survived: the  Voyage of Mael Dúin , the  Voyage of the Uí Chorra , and the  Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla . The Voyage of Mael Duin is the forerunner of the later  Voyage of St. Brendan . While not as ancient, later 8th century AD works, that influenced European literature, include  |The_Vision_of_Adamnán|The_Vision_Of_Adamnán| .          During the first few years of the 20th Century,  |Herminie_T._Kavanagh|Herminie_T._Kavanagh|  wrote down many Irish folk tales which she published in magazines and in two books. Twenty-six years after her death, the tales from her two books, Darby OGill and the Good People, and Ashes of Old Wishes were made into the film  |Darby_OGill_and_the_Little_People|Darby_Ogill_And_The_Little_People| .
