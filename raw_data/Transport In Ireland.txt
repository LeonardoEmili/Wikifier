      Most of the  transport system in Ireland  is in public hands, either side of the  |Irish_border|Republic_Of_Ireland–United_Kingdom_Border| . The  |Irish_road_network|Roads_In_Ireland|  has evolved separately in the two jurisdictions into which Ireland is divided, while the  |Irish_rail_network|Rail_Transport_In_Ireland|  was mostly created prior to the  |partition_of_Ireland|Partition_Of_Ireland| .     In the  Republic of Ireland , the  |Minister_for_Transport|Minister_For_Transport,_Tourism_And_Sport| , acting through the  |Department_of_Transport|Department_Of_Transport,_Tourism_And_Sport| , is responsible for the States road network,  |rail_network|Rail_Transport| , public transport, airports and several other areas. Although some sections of road have been built using private or  |public-private_funds|Public-Private_Partnership| , and are operated as  |toll_roads|Toll_Road| , they are owned by the  |Government_of_Ireland|Government_Of_Ireland| . The rail network is also  |state-owned|Government-Owned_Corporation|  and operated, while the government currently still owns the main airports. Public transport is mainly in the hands of a  |statutory_corporation|Statutory_Corporation| ,  |Córas_Iompair_Éireann|Córas_Iompair_Éireann|  , and its subsidiaries, Bus Átha Cliath ,  |Bus_Éireann|Bus_Éireann|  , and  |Iarnród_Éireann|Iarnród_Éireann|  .     On 1 November 2005, the Irish government published the  |Transport_21|Transport_21|  plan which includes €18bn for improved roads and €16bn for improved rail, including the  |Western_Railway_Corridor|Western_Railway_Corridor|  and the  |Dublin_Metro|Dublin_Metro| .     The Republic of Irelands transport sector is responsible for 21% of the states greenhouse gas emissions.      In  Northern Ireland , the road network and railways are in state ownership. The  |Department_for_Infrastructure|Department_For_Infrastructure|  is responsible for these and other areas . Two of the three main airports in Northern Ireland are privately operated and owned. The exception is  |City_of_Derry_Airport|City_Of_Derry_Airport| , which is owned and funded by  |Derry_City_Council|Derry_City_Council| . A statutory corporation, the  |Northern_Ireland_Transport_Holding_Company|Northern_Ireland_Transport_Holding_Company|   operates public transport services through its three subsidiaries –  |NI_Railways|Ni_Railways|  Company Limited,  |Ulsterbus|Ulsterbus|  Limited, and  |Citybus_Limited|Metro|  .          ;Total    :  |broad_gauge|Irish_Gauge|    : ;  electrified;  double track; some additions and removals since 1997     :  |standard_gauge|Standard_Gauge|    : ;  electrified;  double track; additional track under construction     :  |narrow_gauge|Narrow_Gauge_Railway|    :      Irelands  |railways|Rail_Transportation|  are in State ownership, with  |Iarnród_Éireann|Iarnród_Éireann|  operating services in the Republic and  |NI_Railways|Ni_Railways|  operating services in Northern Ireland. The two companies co-operate in providing the joint  |Enterprise|Enterprise|  service between  |Dublin|Dublin|  and  |Belfast|Belfast| .  |InterCity|Intercity|  services are provided between Dublin and the major towns and cities of the Republic, and in Ulster along the  |Belfast–Derry_railway_line|Belfast–Derry_Railway_Line| . Suburban railway networks operate in Dublin,  |Dublin_Suburban_Rail|Dublin_Suburban_Rail| , and Belfast,  |Belfast_Suburban_Rail|Belfast_Suburban_Rail| , with limited local services being offered in, or planned for,  |Cork|Cork| ,  |Limerick|Limerick| , and  |Galway|Galway| .     The rail network in Ireland was developed by various private companies during the 19th century, with some receiving government funding. The network reached its greatest extent by 1920. A  |broad_gauge|Broad_Gauge|  of 1600mm  was agreed as  |the_standard|Irish_Gauge|  for the island, although there were also hundreds of kilometres of 914mm  |narrow_gauge_railways|Narrow_Gauge_Railways| .     Many lines in the west were decommissioned in the 1930s under  |Éamon_de_Valera|Éamon_De_Valera| , with a further large cull in services by both CIÉ and the  |Ulster_Transport_Authority|Ulster_Transport_Authority|  during the 1960s, leaving few working lines in the northern third of the island. There is a campaign to bring some closed lines back into service, in particular the Limerick- |Sligo|Sligo|  line , to facilitate economic regeneration in the west, which has lagged behind the rest of the country. There is also a move to restore service on the Dublin to  |Navan|Navan|  line, and smaller campaigns to re-establish the rail links between  |Sligo|Sligo|  and  |Enniskillen|Enniskillen| / |Omagh|Omagh| /Derry and Mullingar and  |Athlone|Athlone| /Galway. Under the Irish governments  |Transport_21|Transport_21|  plan, the Cork to  |Midleton|Midleton|  rail link was reopened in 2009. The re-opening of the  |Navan|Navan| - |Clonsilla|Clonsilla|  rail link and the  |Western_Rail_Corridor|Western_Rail_Corridor|  are amongst future projects as part of the same plan.      Public transport services in Northern Ireland are sparse in comparison with those of the rest of Ireland or Great Britain. A large railway network was severely curtailed in the 1950s and 1960s.  Current services includes suburban routes to  |Larne|Larne| , Newry and  |Bangor|Bangor,_Northern_Ireland| , as well as services to Derry. There is also a branch from  |Coleraine|Coleraine|  to  |Portrush|Portrush| .      Since 1984 an electrified train service run by Iarnród Éireann has linked Dublin with its coastal suburbs. Running initially between  |Bray|Bray,_County_Wicklow|  and  |Howth|Howth| , the  |Dublin_Area_Rapid_Transit|Dublin_Area_Rapid_Transit|  system was extended from  |Bray|Bray,_County_Wicklow|  to  |Greystones|Greystones|  in 2000 and further extended from  |Howth_Junction|Howth_Junction|  to  |Malahide|Malahide_Railway_Station| . In 2004 a  |light_rail|Light_Rail|  system, Luas, was opened in Dublin serving the central and western suburbs, run by  |Veolia|Veolia|  under franchise from the  |Railway_Procurement_Agency|Railway_Procurement_Agency| . The construction of the Luas system caused much disruption in Dublin. Plans to construct a  |Dublin_Metro|Dublin_Metro|  service including underground lines were mooted in 2001, but stalled in the financial crisis at the end of that decade.     Ireland has one of the largest dedicated  |freight|Freight|  railways in Europe, operated by  |Bord_na_Móna|Bord_Na_Móna|  totalling nearly .                ;Total –    :South:  including  of motorway   :North:  including  of motorway   ::paved – , unpaved –      Irelands roads link Dublin with all the major cities . Driving is on the left. Signposts in the Republic of Ireland are shown in kilometres and speed limits in kilometres per hour. Distance and speed limit signs in Northern Ireland use imperial units in common with the rest of the United Kingdom.     Historically, land owners developed most roads and later  |Turnpike_Trusts|Turnpike_Trusts|  collected tolls so that as early as 1800 Ireland had a  road network.  In 2005 the Irish Government launched  |Transport_21|Transport_21| , a plan envisaging the investment of €34 billion in transport infrastructure from 2006 until 2015.  Several road projects were progressed but the economic crisis that began in 2008–09 has prevented its full implementation.     Between 2011 and 2015,  |diesel_cars|Diesel_Engine|  constituted 70% of new cars.  In 2015, 27 new cars per 1,000 inhabitants were registered in Ireland, the same as the EU average.        Irelands first  |mail_coach|Mail_Coach|  services were contracted with the government by  |John_Anderson|John_Anderson|  with William Bourne in 1791 who also paid to improve the condition of the roads.  The system of mail coaches, carriages and bians was further developed by  |Charles_Bianconi|Charles_Bianconi| , based in Clonmel, from 1815 as a fore-runner of the modern Irish  |public_transportation|Public_Transportation|  system.      State-owned  |Bus_Éireann|Bus_Éireann|  currently provides most bus services in the Republic of Ireland, outside Dublin, including an express coach network connecting most cities in Ireland, along with local bus services in the provincial cities. Bus Átha Cliath , a sister company of  |Bus_Éireann|Bus_Éireann| , provides most of the bus services in Dublin, with  |some_other_operators|Public_Transport_Operators_In_Dublinbus|  providing a number of routes. These include  |Aircoach|Aircoach| , a subsidiary of  |FirstGroup|Firstgroup|  which provides services to  |Dublin_Airport|Dublin_Airport|  from Dublin city centre, South Dublin City, Greystones and Bray. They also operate two intercity express non-stop services service between Dublin Airport, Dublin City Centre, and  |Cork|Cork|  and also a non-stop route between Belfast City Centre, Dublin Airport and Dublin City. Other operators such as Irish Citylink and GoBus.ie compete on the Dublin-Galway route.  |Matthews_Coaches|Matthews_Coaches|  run a direct service from  |Bettystown|Bettystown| ,  |Laytown|Laytown|  and  |Julianstown|Julianstown|  to Dublin whilst Dublin Coach operate services to Portlaoise and Limerick.  |JJ_Kavanagh_and_Sons|Jj_Kavanagh_And_Sons|  also operates regular services on the Portlaoise/Limerick route as well as offering services to  |Waterford|Waterford| ,  |Carlow|Carlow| ,  |Kilkenny|Kilkenny| ,  |Clonmel|Clonmel|  and a selection of regional towns and villages in the south.     Some private rural operators exist, such as Halpennys in  |Blackrock|Blackrock,_County_Louth| , County Louth, which was the first private bus operator to run a public service in Ireland,  |Bus_Feda|Bus_Feda|  , which operates twice daily routes from  |Ranafast|Ranafast| ,  |County_Donegal|County_Donegal|  to Galway and back.      In Northern Ireland  |Ulsterbus|Ulsterbus|  provides the bus network, with its sister company  |Metro|Metro|  providing services in Belfast. Both are part of state-owned  |Translink|Translink| . Tiger Coaches operates a very late night bus service on Friday and Saturday nights between Belfast and Lisburn.  report on launch of Tiger Coaches service     Private hire companies such as Flynns  or Eirebus  Irish Private Coach Travel offer groups travelling throughout Ireland with options ranging from cars to 56 passenger coaches and many run route between airports, Pavilions Shopping Centre, National Convention Centre and the 3Arena.     Cross-border services are run primarily by a partnership of Ulsterbus and Bus Éireann with some services run across the border exclusively by one of the two companies .  |Aircoach|Aircoach| , a private operator, does however operate a competing Dublin to Belfast Express service via Dublin Airport.                  ;Total –    :     |Grand_Canal|Waterway_Grand_Canal| |Waterway_Royal_Canal|Waterway_Royal_Canal| |Shannon–Erne_Waterway|Shannon–Erne_Waterway| |Waterway_River_Barrow|Waterway_River_Barrow|        Natural gas transmission network  .

Ireland has major ports in  |Dublin|Dublin_Port| ,  |Belfast|Port_Of_Belfast| ,  |Cork|Cork_Harbour| ,  |Rosslare|Rosslare_Europort| ,  |Derry|Londonderry_Port|  and  |Waterford|Port_Of_Waterford| . Smaller ports exist in Arklow, Ballina, Drogheda, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Foynes, Galway, Larne, Limerick, New Ross, Sligo, Warrenpoint and Wicklow.     Ports in the Republic of Ireland handled 2.8 million travellers crossing  |the_sea_between_Ireland_and_Great_Britain|Irish_Sea|  in 2014, a decrease of 1 million passengers movements since 2003.  This has been steadily dropping for a number of years , probably as a result of  |low_cost_airlines|Low-Cost_Carrier| . Ferry connections between  |Britain|Great_Britain|  and Ireland via the Irish Sea include the routes from  |Fishguard|Fishguard|  and  |Pembroke|Pembroke,_Pembrokeshire|  to Rosslare,  |Stranraer|Stranraer|  to Belfast and Larne, and  |Cairnryan|Cairnryan|  to Larne; the  |Swansea|Swansea|  to Cork route has closed. There is also a connection between  |Liverpool|Liverpool|  and Belfast via the  |Isle_of_Man|Isle_Of_Man| . The worlds largest car ferry,  Ulysses , is operated by  |Irish_Ferries|Irish_Continental|  on the Dublin–Holyhead route.     In addition, there are ferries from Rosslare and Dublin to Cherbourg and Roscoff in France.     The vast majority of heavy goods trade is done by sea. Northern Irish ports handle 10 megatonnes of goods trade with Britain annually, while ports in the south handle 7.6 Mt, representing 50% and 40% respectively of total trade by weight.

All provide services to Great Britain and continental Europe, while Belfast International, Cork, Dublin and Shannon also offer transatlantic services.   The London to Dublin air route is the ninth busiest international air route in the world, and also the busiest international air route in Europe, with 14,500 flights between the two in 2017.  In 2015, 4.5 million people took the route, at that time, the worlds second-busiest.   |Aer_Lingus|Aer_Lingus|  is the flag carrier of Ireland, although  |Ryanair|Ryanair|  is the countrys largest airline. Ryanair is Europes largest low-cost carrier,  the second largest in terms of passenger numbers, and the worlds largest in terms of international passenger numbers.  For several decades until 2007 Shannon was a mandatory  |stopover|Shannon_Airportshannon_Stopover|  for transatlantic routes to the United States.  In recent years it has opened a pre-screening service allowing passengers to pass through US immigration services before departing from Ireland.     There are also several smaller regional airports:  |George_Best_Belfast_City_Airport|George_Best_Belfast_City_Airport| ,  |City_of_Derry_Airport|City_Of_Derry_Airport| ,  |Galway_Airport|Galway_Airport| ,  |Kerry_Airport|Kerry_Airport|  ,  |Sligo_Airport|Sligo_Airport|  ,  |Waterford_Airport|Waterford_Airport|  and  |Donegal_Airport|Donegal_Airport|  .
