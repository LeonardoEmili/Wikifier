           The Tetraodontidae are a  |family|Family|  of primarily marine and  |estuarine_fish|Estuarine_Fish|  of the  |order|Order| |_Tetraodontiformes|Tetraodontiformes| . The family includes many familiar species which are variously called pufferfish, puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies, honey toads, sugar toads, and sea squab.  They are  |morphologically|Morphology|  similar to the closely related  |porcupinefish|Porcupinefish| , which have large external spines . The scientific name refers to the four large teeth, fused into an upper and lower plate, which are used for crushing the hard shells of  |crustaceans|Crustacean|  and  |mollusks|Mollusk| , their natural prey.     The majority of pufferfish species are  |toxic|Toxic|  and some are among the most poisonous  |vertebrates|Vertebrate|  in the world. In certain species, the internal organs, such as the liver, and sometimes their skin, contain  |tetrodotoxin|Tetrodotoxin|  and are highly toxic to most animals when eaten; nevertheless, the meat of some species is considered a delicacy in  |Japan|Japan|  ,  |Korea|Korea|  , and  |China|China|   when prepared by specially trained chefs who know which part is safe to eat and in what quantity. Other pufferfish species with nontoxic flesh, such as the  |northern_puffer|Northern_Puffer| , Sphoeroides maculatus, of  |Chesapeake_Bay|Chesapeake_Bay| ,  are considered a delicacy elsewhere.     The species  Torquigener albomaculosus  was called by  |David_Attenborough|David_Attenborough|  the greatest artist of the animal kingdom due to the males unique habit of wooing females by creating nests in sand composed of complex geometric designs.        The Tetraodontidae contain at least 200 species of puffers in 29 genera:        Amblyrhynchotes  Troschel, 1856    Arothron  Müller, 1841    Auriglobus  Kottelat, 1999    Canthigaster  Swainson, 1839    Carinotetraodon  Benl, 1957    Chelonodon  Müller, 1841    Chonerhinos  Bleeker, 1854    Colomesus  Gill, 1884    Contusus  Whitley, 1947      Dichotomyctere  Duméril, 1855      Ephippion  Bibron, 1855    Feroxodon  Su, Hardy et Tyler, 1986    Guentheridia  Gilbert et Starks, 1904    Javichthys  Hardy, 1985    Leiodon  Swainson, 1839    Lagocephalus  Swainson, 1839    Marilyna  Hardy, 1982    Monotrete  Bibron, 1855    Omegaphora  Whitley, 1934    Pelagocephalus  Tyler & Paxton, 1979    Polyspina  Hardy, 1983    Pao  Kottelat, 2013    Reicheltia  Hardy, 1982    Sphoeroides  Anonymous, 1798    Takifugu  Abe, 1949    Tetractenos  Hardy, 1983    Tetraodon  Linnaeus, 1758    Torquigener  Whitley, 1930    Tylerius  Hardy, 1984            Arothron stellatus   Canthigaster valentini   Carinotetraodon irrubesco   Colomesus asellus   Ephippion guttifer   Lagocephalus lagocephalus   Omegaphora cyanopunctata   Sphoeroides spengleri   Takifugu rubripes   Tetractenos glaber   Tetraodon mbu          They are typically small to medium in size, although a few species can reach lengths greater than .        They are most diverse in the  |tropics|Tropical_Zone| , relatively uncommon in the  |temperate_zone|Temperate_Zone| , and completely absent from  |cold_waters|Polar_Region| .       Most pufferfish species live in marine or  |brackish|Brackish|  waters, but some can enter fresh water. About 35 species spend their entire lifecycles in fresh water. These fresh water species are found in disjunct tropical regions of South America , Africa  and Southeast Asia .

Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences 43: 1-16.       The puffers unique and distinctive natural defenses help compensate for its slow locomotion. It moves by combining  |pectoral|Pectoral_Fin| ,  |dorsal|Dorsal_Fin| ,  |anal|Anal_Fin| , and  |caudal_fins|Caudal_Fin| . This makes it highly maneuverable, but very slow, and therefore a comparatively easy predation target. Its tail fin is mainly used as a rudder, but it can be used for a sudden evasive burst of speed that shows none of the care and precision of its usual movements. The puffers excellent eyesight, combined with this speed burst, is the first and most important defense against predators.          The pufferfishs secondary defense mechanism, used if successfully pursued, is to fill its extremely elastic  |stomach|Stomach|  with water until it is much larger and almost  |spherical|Sphere|  in shape. Even if they are not visible when the puffer is not inflated, all puffers have pointed spines, so a hungry predator may suddenly find itself facing an unpalatable, pointy ball rather than a slow, tasty fish. Predators that do not heed this warning may die from choking, and predators that do manage to swallow the puffer may find their stomachs full of  |tetrodotoxin|Tetrodotoxin|  , making puffers an unpleasant, possibly lethal, choice of prey. This  |neurotoxin|Neurotoxin|  is found primarily in the  |ovaries|Ovary|  and  |liver|Liver| , although smaller amounts exist in the  |intestines|Intestines|  and  |skin|Skin| , as well as trace amounts in muscle. It does not always have a lethal effect on large predators, such as sharks, but it can kill humans.     Larval pufferfish are  |chemically_defended|Chemical_Defense|  by the presence of TTX on the surface of skin, which causes predators to spit them out.      Not all puffers are necessarily poisonous; the flesh of the  |northern_puffer|Northern_Puffer|  is not toxic  and it is considered a delicacy in North America.   Takifugu oblongus , for example, is a  fugu  puffer that is not poisonous, and toxin level varies widely even in fish that are. A puffers neurotoxin is not necessarily as toxic to other animals as it is to humans, and puffers are eaten routinely by some species of fish, such as  |lizardfish|Lizardfish|   and  |sharks|Shark| .      Puffers are able to move their eyes independently, and many species can change the color or intensity of their patterns in response to environmental changes. In these respects, they are somewhat similar to the terrestrial  |chameleon|Chameleon| . Although most puffers are drab, many have bright colors and distinctive markings, and make no attempt to hide from predators. This is likely an example of  |honestly_signaled|Honest_Signal| |_aposematism|Aposematism| .       |Dolphins|Dolphin|  have been filmed expertly handling pufferfish amongst themselves in an apparent attempt to get high or enter a trance-like state.        Many marine puffers have a  |pelagic|Pelagic| , or open-ocean, life stage. Spawning occurs after males slowly push females to the water surface or join females already present. The eggs are spherical and buoyant. Hatching occurs after roughly four days. The fry are tiny, but under magnification have a shape usually reminiscent of a pufferfish. They have a functional mouth and eyes, and must eat within a few days. Brackish-water puffers may breed in bays in a similar manner to marine species, or may breed more similarly to the freshwater species, in cases where they have moved far enough upriver.     Reproduction in freshwater species varies quite a bit. The  |dwarf_puffers|Dwarf_Pufferfish|  court with males following females, possibly displaying the crests and keels unique to this subgroup of species. After the female accepts his advances, she will lead the male into plants or another form of cover, where she can release eggs for fertilization. The male may help her by rubbing against her side. This has been observed in captivity, and they are the only commonly captive-spawned puffer species.     Target-group puffers have also been spawned in aquariums, and follow a similar courting behavior, minus the crest/keel display. However, eggs are laid on a flat piece of slate or other smooth, hard material, to which they adhere. The male will guard them until they hatch, carefully blowing water over them regularly to keep the eggs healthy. His parenting is finished when the young hatch, and the fry are on their own.     Information on breeding of specific species is very limited.  T. nigroviridis , the green-spotted puffer, has recently been artificially spawned under captive conditions. It is believed to spawn in bays in a similar manner to saltwater species, as their sperm was found to be motile only at full marine salinities, but actual wild breeding has never been observed.  Xenopterus naritus  has been reported to be first breed artificially in Sarawak, Northwestern Borneo in June 2016, which the main purpose is for development in aquaculture of the species.      In 2012, males of the species  Torquigener albomaculosus  were documented carving large geometric, circular structures in the seabed sand in  |Amami_Ōshima|Amami_Ōshima| , Japan. The structures serve to attract females and provide a safe place for them to lay their eggs.         A pufferfishs diet can vary depending on its environment. Traditionally, their diet consists mostly of algae and small invertebrates. They can survive on a completely vegetarian diet if their environment is lacking resources, but prefer an omnivorous food selection. Larger species of pufferfish are able to use their beak-like front teeth to break open clams, mussels, as well as other shellfish. Some species of pufferfish have also been known to enact various hunting techniques ranging from ambush to open water hunting.   |White_spotted_puffer|White_Spotted_Puffer| |_Striped_puffer|Arothron_Manilensis| |_skin_pattern|Patterns_In_Nature|  of the  |giant_or_mbu_puffer|Giant_Puffer|             The tetraodontids have been estimated to diverge from  |diodontids|Diodontid|  between 89 and 138 million years ago. The four major clades diverged during the  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  between 80 and 101 million years ago. The oldest known pufferfish genus is  Eotetraodon , from the  |Lutetian|Lutetian|  epoch of Middle  |Eocene|Eocene|  Europe, with fossils found in  |Monte_Bolca|Monte_Bolca|  and the  |Caucasus_Mountains|Caucasus_Mountains| . The Monte Bolca species, E. pygmaeus, coexisted with several other tetraodontiforms, including an extinct species of diodontid, primitive  |boxfish|Boxfish|  , and other, totally extinct forms, such as  Zignoichthys  and the  |spinacanthids|Spinacanthidae| .   The extinct genus,  Archaeotetraodon  is known from  |Miocene|Miocene| -aged fossils from Europe.               Pufferfish can be lethal if not served properly. Puffer poisoning usually results from consumption of incorrectly prepared puffer soup,  fugu chiri , or occasionally from raw puffer meat,  sashimi fugu . While chiri is much more likely to cause death, sashimi fugu often causes intoxication, light-headedness, and numbness of the lips. Pufferfish  |tetrodotoxin|Tetrodotoxin|  deadens the tongue and lips, and induces dizziness and vomiting, followed by numbness and prickling over the body, rapid heart rate, decreased  |blood_pressure|Blood_Pressure| , and muscle  |paralysis|Paralysis| . The toxin paralyzes the  |diaphragm|Thoracic_Diaphragm|  muscle and stops the person who has ingested it from breathing. People who live longer than 24 hours typically survive, although possibly after a  |coma|Coma|  lasting several days.     The source of tetrodotoxin in puffers has been a matter of debate, Lehman, Elizabeth M. . https://books.google.com/books?idmShBpFb-ziAC & printsecfrontcovervonepage & qcontroversial & ffalse Egg Toxicity and Egg Predation in Rough-Skinned Newts. . Proquest Dissertations and Theses database. UMI No: 3229594. pp. 32–33. but it is increasingly accepted that bacteria in the fishs intestinal tract are the source.       |Saxitoxin|Saxitoxin| , the cause of  |paralytic_shellfish_poisoning|Paralytic_Shellfish_Poisoning|  and  |red_tide|Red_Tide| , can also be found in certain puffers.         In September 2012, the  |Bureau_of_Fisheries_and_Aquatic_Resources|Bureau_Of_Fisheries_And_Aquatic_Resources|  in the  |Philippines|Philippines|  issued a warning not to eat puffer fish, after local fishermen died upon consuming puffer fish for dinner. The warning indicated that puffer fish toxin is 100 times more potent than  |cyanide|Cyanide| .          Pufferfish, called pakpao in  |Thailand|Thailand| , are usually consumed by mistake. They are often cheaper than other fish, and because they contain inconsistent levels of toxins between fish and season, there is little awareness or monitoring of the danger. Consumers are regularly hospitalized and some even die from the poisoning.         Cases of neurological symptoms, including numbness and tingling of the lips and mouth, have been reported to rise after the consumption of puffers caught in the area of  |Titusville_Florida|Titusville_Florida| , U.S. The symptoms generally resolve within hours to days, although one affected individual required  |intubation|Intubation|  for 72 hours.  As a result, Florida banned the harvesting of puffers from certain bodies of water.        Treatment is mainly supportive and consists of intestinal decontamination with  |gastric_lavage|Gastric_Lavage|  and  |activated_charcoal|Activated_Charcoal| , and life-support until the toxin is metabolized. Case reports suggest  |anticholinesterases|Anticholinesterase|  such as  |edrophonium|Edrophonium|  may be effective.
