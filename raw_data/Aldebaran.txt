                                      Aldebaran , designated α Tauri , is a  |red_giant_star|Red_Giant_Star|  about 65  |light-years|Light-Year|  from the Sun in the  |zodiac|Zodiac| |constellation|Constellation| |Taurus|Taurus| . It is the brightest  |star|Star|  in Taurus and generally the  |fourteenth-brightest_star|List_Of_Brightest_Stars|  in the night sky, though it varies slowly in brightness between magnitude 0.75 and 0.95. Aldebaran hosts a planet several times the size of  |Jupiter|Jupiter| , named .     Aldebaran is a red giant, cooler than the sun with a surface temperature of , but its radius is about 44 times  |the_suns|Solar_Radius| , so it is over 400 times as  |luminous|Solar_Luminosity| . It spins slowly and takes 520 days to complete a rotation.     The planetary exploration probe  |Pioneer_10|Pioneer_10|  is heading in the general direction of the star and should make its closest approach in about two million years.       The traditional name Aldebaran derives from the Arabic al Dabarān, meaning the follower , because it seems to follow the  |Pleiades|Pleiades| . In 2016, the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union| |Working_Group_on_Star_Names|Iau_Working_Group_On_Star_Names|  approved the proper name Aldebaran for this star.     Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus and so has the  |Bayer_designation|Bayer_Designation|  α Tauri, Latinised as Alpha Tauri. It has the  |Flamsteed_designation|Flamsteed_Designation|  87 Tauri as the 87th star in the constellation of approximately 7th magnitude or brighter, ordered by  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension| . It also has the  |Bright_Star_Catalogue|Bright_Star_Catalogue|  number 1457, the  |HD|Henry_Draper_Catalogue|  number 29139, and the  |Hipparcos|Hipparcos|  catalogue number 21421, mostly seen in scientific publications.     It is a variable star listed in the  |General_Catalogue_of_Variable_Stars|General_Catalogue_Of_Variable_Stars| , but it is listed using its Bayer designation and does not have a separate  |variable_star_designation|Variable_Star_Designation| .     Aldebaran and several nearby stars are included in double star catalogues such as the  |Washington_Double_Star_Catalog|Washington_Double_Star_Catalog|  as WDS  04359+1631 and the  |Aitken_Double_Star_Catalogue|Aitken_Double_Star_Catalogue|  as ADS  3321. It was included with an 11th magnitude companion as a double star as H  IV  66 in the  |Herschel_Catalogue_of_Double_Stars|Herschel_Catalogue_Of_Double_Stars|  and Σ  II  2 in the  |Struve_Double_Star_Catalog|Struve_Double_Star_Catalog| , and together with a 14th magnitude star as β  550 in the  |Burnham_Double_Star_Catalogue|Burnham_Double_Star_Catalogue| .          Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find in the  |night_sky|Night_Sky| , partly due to its brightness and partly due to being near one of the more noticeable  |asterisms|Asterism|  in the sky. Following the three stars of  |Orions_belt|Orions_Belt|  in the opposite direction to  |Sirius|Sirius| , the first bright star encountered is Aldebaran.      The star is, by chance, in the line of sight between the Earth and the  |Hyades|Hyades| , so it has the appearance of being the brightest member of the  |open_cluster|Open_Cluster| , but the cluster that forms the bulls-head-shaped asterism is more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.      Aldebaran is 5.47 degrees south of the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic|  and so can be  |occulted|Occultation|  by the  |Moon|Moon| . Such occultations occur when the Moons  |ascending_node|Ascending_Node|  is near the  |autumnal_equinox|Autumnal_Equinox| . A series of 49 occultations occurred starting on 29 January 2015 and ending at 3 September 2018. Each event was visible from points in the  |northern_hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere|  or close to the  |equator|Equator| ; people in e.g. Australia or  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  can never observe an Aldebaran occultation since it is too far south of the ecliptic. A reasonably accurate estimate for the diameter of Aldebaran was obtained during the occultation of 22 September 1978. Aldebaran is in  |conjunction|Conjunction|  with the Sun around June 1 of each year.        With a near- |infrared|Infrared| |J_band|J_Band| |magnitude|Magnitude|  of −2.1, only  |Betelgeuse|Betelgeuse|  ,  |R_Doradus|R_Doradus|  , and  |Arcturus|Arcturus|  are brighter at that wavelength.          On 11 March AD  509, a lunar  |occultation|Occultation|  of Aldebaran was observed in  |Athens|Athens| ,  |Greece|Greece| . English astronomer  |Edmund_Halley|Edmund_Halley|  studied the timing of this event, and in 1718 concluded that Aldebaran must have changed position since that time, moving several minutes of arc further to the north. This, as well as observations of the changing positions of stars  |Sirius|Sirius|  and  |Arcturus|Arcturus| , led to the discovery of  |proper_motion|Proper_Motion| . Based on present day observations, the position of Aldebaran has shifted 7′ in the last 2000 years; roughly a quarter the diameter of the  |full_moon|Full_Moon| . Due to  |precession_of_the_equinoxes|Precession_Of_The_Equinoxes| , 5,000 years ago the  |vernal_equinox|Vernal_Equinox|  was close to Aldebaran.     English astronomer  |William_Herschel|William_Herschel|  discovered a faint companion to Aldebaran in 1782; an 11th magnitude star at an  |angular_separation|Angular_Separation|  of 117 |″|Arc_Second| . This star was shown to be itself a close  |double_star|Double_Star|  by  |S._W._Burnham|Sherburne_Wesley_Burnham|  in 1888, and he discovered an additional 14th magnitude companion at an angular separation of 31″. Follow on measurements of proper motion showed that Herschels companion was diverging from Aldebaran, and hence they were not physically connected. However, the companion discovered by Burnham had almost exactly the same proper motion as Aldebaran, suggesting that the two formed a wide  |binary_star|Binary_Star|  system.     Working at his private observatory in  |Tulse_Hill|Tulse_Hill| ,  |England|England| , in 1864  |William_Huggins|William_Huggins|  performed the first studies of the spectrum of Aldebaran, where he was able to identify the lines of nine elements, including  |iron|Iron| ,  |sodium|Sodium| ,  |calcium|Calcium| , and  |magnesium|Magnesium| . In 1886,  |Edward_C._Pickering|Edward_Charles_Pickering|  at the  |Harvard_College_Observatory|Harvard_College_Observatory|  used a photographic plate to capture fifty  |absorption_lines|Absorption_Line|  in the spectrum of Aldebaran. This became part of the  |Draper_Catalogue|Henry_Draper_Catalogue| , published in 1890. By 1887, the photographic technique had improved to the point that it was possible to measure a stars  |radial_velocity|Radial_Velocity|  from the amount of  |Doppler_shift|Doppler_Shift|  in the spectrum. By this means, the recession velocity of Aldebaran was estimated as  , using measurements performed at  |Potsdam_Observatory|Potsdam_Observatory|  by  |Hermann_C._Vogel|Hermann_Carl_Vogel|  and his assistant  |Julius_Scheiner|Julius_Scheiner| .     Aldebaran was observed using an interferometer attached to the  |Hooker_Telescope|Hooker_Telescope|  at the  |Mount_Wilson_Observatory|Mount_Wilson_Observatory|  in 1921 in order to measure its  |angular_diameter|Angular_Diameter| , but it was not resolved in these observations.     The extensive history of observations of Aldebaran led to it being included in the list of 33 stars chosen as benchmarks for the  |Gaia_mission|Gaia_Mission|  to calibrate derived stellar parameters. It had previously been used to calibrate instruments on board the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope| .            Aldebaran is listed as the  |spectral_standard|Stellar_Classification|  for  |type_K5+_III_stars|K-Type_Giant| . Its spectrum shows that it is a  |giant_star|Giant_Star|  that has evolved off the  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  band of the  |Hertzsprung–Russell_diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell_Diagram|  after exhausting the  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  at its core. The collapse of the centre of the star into a degenerate  |helium|Helium|  core has ignited a shell of hydrogen outside the core and Aldebaran is now on the  |red_giant_branch|Red_Giant_Branch|  .     The  |effective_temperature|Effective_Temperature|  of Aldebarans  |photosphere|Photosphere|  is . It has a surface gravity of , typical for a giant star, but around 25 times lower than the Earths and 700 times lower than the suns. Its  |metallicity|Metallicity|  is about 30% lower than the suns.     Measurements by the  |Hipparcos|Hipparcos|  satellite and other sources put Aldebaran around  away. Asteroseismology has determined that it is about 16% more massive than the  |Sun|Sun| , yet it shines with 518 times the Suns luminosity due to the expanded radius. The angular diameter of Aldebaran has been measured many times. The value adopted as part of the Gaia benchmark calibration is . It is 44 times the  |diameter_of_the_Sun|Solar_Radius| , approximately 61 million kilometres.     Aldebaran is a slightly  |variable_star|Variable_Star| , assigned to the  |slow_irregular|Slow_Irregular_Variable|  type LB. The  |General_Catalogue_of_Variable_Stars|General_Catalogue_Of_Variable_Stars|  indicates variation between apparent magnitude 0.75 and 0.95 from historical reports. Modern studies show a smaller amplitude, with some showing almost no variation. Hipparcos photometry shows an amplitude of only about 0.02 magnitudes and a possible period around 18 days. Intensive ground-based photometry showed variations of up to 0.03 magnitudes and a possible period around 91 days. Analysis of observations over a much longer period still find a total amplitude likely to be less than 0.1 magnitudes, and the variation is considered to be irregular.     The  |photosphere|Photosphere|  shows abundances of  |carbon|Carbon| ,  |oxygen|Oxygen| , and  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  that suggest the giant has gone through its first  |dredge-up|Dredge-Up|  stage—a normal step in the evolution of a star into a red giant during which material from deep within the star is brought up to the surface by  |convection|Convection_Zone| . With its slow rotation, Aldebaran lacks a  |dynamo|Dynamo_Theory|  needed to generate a  |corona|Corona|  and hence is not a source of  |hard_X-ray_emission|X-Ray_Astronomy| . However, small scale  |magnetic_fields|Stellar_Magnetic_Field|  may still be present in the lower atmosphere, resulting from convection turbulence near the surface. The measured strength of the magnetic field on Aldebaran is 0.22   |Gauss|Gauss| . Any resulting soft X-ray emissions from this region may be attenuated by the  |chromosphere|Chromosphere| , although ultraviolet emission has been detected in the  |spectrum|Stellar_Spectrum| . The star is currently losing mass at a rate of   with a velocity of . This  |stellar_wind|Stellar_Wind|  may be generated by the weak magnetic fields in the lower atmosphere.     Beyond the chromosphere of Aldebaran is an extended molecular outer atmosphere where the temperature is cool enough for molecules of gas to form. This region lies at about 2.5 times the radius of the star and has a temperature of about . The spectrum reveals lines of  |carbon_monoxide|Carbon_Monoxide| ,  |water|Water| , and  |titanium_oxide|Titanium_Oxide| . Outside the MOLSphere, the stellar wind continues to expand until it reaches the  |termination_shock|Termination_Shock|  boundary with the hot, ionized  |interstellar_medium|Interstellar_Medium|  that dominates the  |Local_Bubble|Local_Bubble| , forming a roughly spherical  |astrosphere|Astrosphere|  with a radius of around 1,000  AU, centered on Aldebaran.       Five faint stars appear close to Aldebaran in the sky. These  |double_star|Double_Star|  components were given upper-case  |Latin_letter|Latin-Script_Alphabet|  designations more or less in the order of their discovery, with the letter A reserved for the primary star. Some characteristics of these components, including their position relative to Aldebaran, are shown in the table.          Some surveys, for example  |Gaia_Data_Release_2|Gaia_Data_Release_2| , have indicated that Alpha Tauri B may have about the same  |proper_motion|Proper_Motion|  and  |parallax|Parallax|  as Aldebaran and thus may be a  |physical_binary|Binary_Star|  system. These measurements are difficult, since the dim B component appears so close to the bright primary star, and the margin of error is too large to establish a physical relationship between the two. So far neither the B component, nor anything else, has been unambiguously shown to be physically associated with Aldebaran. A spectral type of M2.5 has been published for Alpha Tauri B.     Alpha Tauri CD is a  |binary_system|Binary_Star|  with the C and D component stars gravitationally bound to and co-orbiting each other. These co-orbiting stars have been shown to be located far beyond Aldebaran and are members of the Hyades star cluster. As with the rest of the stars in the cluster they do not physically interact with Aldebaran in any way.            In 1993 radial velocity measurements of Aldebaran,  |Arcturus|Arcturus|  and  |Pollux|Pollux|  showed that Aldebaran exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a  |substellar_companion|Substellar_Companion| . The measurements for Aldebaran implied a companion with a minimum mass 11.4 times that of  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  in a 643-day orbit at a separation of  in a mildly  |eccentric|Eccentricity|  orbit. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion.     In 2015 a study showed stable long-term evidence for both a planetary companion and stellar activity. An  |asteroseismic|Asteroseismic|  analysis of the residuals to the planet fit has determined that Aldebaran  b has a minimum mass of   |Jupiter_mass|Jupiter_Mass| es.          Aldebaran was originally نير الضبران , meaning the bright one of the follower . al Dabarān then applied to the whole of the  |lunar_mansion|Lunar_Mansion|  containing the Hyades. It is assumed that what it was following is the  |Pleiades|Pleiades| . A variety of transliterated spellings have been used, with the current Aldebaran becoming standard relatively recently.       This easily seen and striking star in its suggestive  |asterism|Asterism|  is a popular subject for ancient and modern myths.     Mexican culture: For the  |Seris|Seri_People|  of northwestern Mexico, this star provides light for the seven women giving birth . It has three names: , , and  . The lunar month corresponding to October is called  Aldebarans path .   Aboriginal culture: in the Clarence River of northeastern  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales| , this star is the Ancestor Karambal, who stole another mans wife. The womans husband tracked him down and burned the tree in which he was hiding. It is believed that he rose to the sky as smoke and became the star Aldebaran.          In  |Hindu_astronomy|Hindu_Astronomy|  it is identified as the  |lunar_mansion_Rohini|Rohini|  and as one of the twenty-seven daughters of  |Daksha|Daksha|  and the wife of the god  |Chandra|Chandra|  .            In  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  it has been called  Lampadias, literally torch-like or -bearer .      In  |Chinese|Chinese_Astronomy| ,  , meaning  Net , refers to an  |asterism|Asterism|  consisting Aldebaran,  |ε_Tauri|Epsilon_Tauri| ,  |δ_3_Tauri|Delta3_Tauri| ,  |δ_1_Tauri|Delta1_Tauri| ,  |γ_Tauri|Gamma_Tauri| ,  |71_Tauri|71_Tauri|  and  |λ_Tauri|Lambda_Tauri| . Consequently, the  |Chinese_name|Chinese_Star_Names|  for Aldebaran itself is  , the Fifth Star of Net .          The name Aldebaran or Alpha Tauri has been adopted many times, including    |Aldebaran_Rock|Aldebaran_Rock|  in Antarctica   United States Navy stores ship  and Italian frigate  |Aldebaran|Italian_Frigate_Aldebaran| |Aldebaran|Aldebaran| |Aldebaran_Robotics|Aldebaran_Robotics| |AlphaTauri|Alphatauri|      The star also appears in  |works_of_fiction|Aldebaran_In_Fiction|  such as  Far From the Madding Crowd  and  Down and Out in Paris and London . It is frequently seen in  |science_fiction|Science_Fiction| , including the  Lensman series  and  Fallen Dragon . As the brightest star in a Zodiac constellation, it is also given  |great_significance|Stars_In_Astrologyaldebaran|  within  |astrology|Astrology| .     Aldebaran regularly features in  |conspiracy_theories|Conspiracy_Theory|  as one of the origins of  |extraterrestrial_aliens|List_Of_Alleged_Extraterrestrial_Beings| , often linked to  |Nazi_UFOs|Nazi_Ufos| . A well-known example is the German conspiracy theorist  |Axel_Stoll|Axel_Stoll| , who considered the star the home of the  |Aryan_race|Aryannazism_And_White_Supremacy|  and the target of expeditions by the  |Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht| .
