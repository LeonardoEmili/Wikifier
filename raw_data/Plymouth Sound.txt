            Plymouth Sound, or locally just The Sound, is a  |bay|Headlands_And_Bays|  on the  |English_Channel|English_Channel|  at  |Plymouth|Plymouth|  in England.     Its southwest and southeast corners are  |Penlee_Point|Penlee_Point_Rame|  in  |Cornwall|Cornwall|  and  |Wembury_Point|Wembury_Point|  in  |Devon|Devon| , a distance of about 3  |nautical_miles|Nautical_Mile|  . Its northern limit is  |Plymouth_Hoe|Plymouth_Hoe|  giving a north-south distance of nearly 3 nautical miles .     The Sound has three water entrances. The marine entrance is from the  |English_Channel|English_Channel|  to the south, with a deep-water channel to the west of the  |Plymouth_Breakwater|Plymouth_Breakwater| . There are two freshwater inlets: one, from the northwest, is from the  |River_Tamar|River_Tamar|  via the  |Hamoaze|Hamoaze|  and  |Devonport_Dockyard|Hmnb_Devonport| , the largest naval dockyard in western Europe. The other, at northeast, is from the  |River_Plym|River_Plym|  disgorging into its narrow  |estuary|Estuary| ,  |Cattewater|Cattewater|  harbour between  |Mount_Batten|Mount_Batten|  and the  |Royal_Citadel|The_Citadel_Plymouth_England| .     In addition to ships of the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy| , large commercial vessels, including ferries to France and Spain use the Sound from  |Millbay_Docks|Millbay_Docks| . Fishing vessels use it from  |Sutton_Harbour|Sutton_Harbour|  beside the old town of Plymouth, called the  |Barbican|Barbican_Plymouth| . There are  |marinas|Marina|  at Sutton Harbour, Mount Wise in the Hamoaze and at  |Turnchapel|Turnchapel| . Waterborne traffic in the Sound is controlled by the  |Queens_Harbour_Master|Queens_Harbour_Master|  for Plymouth.       In the centre of the Sound, midway between  |Bovisand|Bovisand|  Bay and  |Cawsand_Bay|Cawsand_Bay| , is  |Plymouth_Breakwater|Plymouth_Breakwater| , which creates a  |harbour|Harbour|  protecting anchored ships from the frequent south-western storms. The  |breakwater|Breakwater|  is around  long, stands in around 11 metres / 36 feet of water and was built by  |John_Rennie|John_Rennie|  and  |Joseph_Whidbey|Joseph_Whidbey|  starting in 1812. The breakwater has a   |lighthouse|Lighthouse|  on its western end and a  beacon with a spherical cage on top at the eastern end. It is said that the cage is a lifesaving device designed to keep wrecked sailors from drowning in the huge waves of a storm on the low-lying breakwater.      |Drakes_Island|Drakes_Island|  is 400 metres long and around 100 metres wide and situated at the north of the Sound. It was fortified to defend Drakes Channel, the only deep-water route to Devonport. The Bridge is a shallow reef that links Drakes Island and the Cornish mainland. At low water the depth of the Bridge can be less than one metre but at high water it can rise to 5 metres. In  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  this natural barrier was supplemented by other obstructions to prevent  |submarines|Submarine|  and small ships attacking the naval base.         |Mount_Batten|Mount_Batten| , a former  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force| |_flying_boat|Flying_Boat|  and  |search_and_rescue|Search_And_Rescue|  base, is located at the northeast corner of the Sound.  |T_E_Lawrence|T_E_Lawrence|  was stationed here as Aircraftman Shaw.     Over the years, the Sound has been defended by Drakes Island,  |Picklecombe_Fort|Picklecombe_Fort| ,  |Cawsand_Fort|Cawsand_Fort| , the  |Breakwater_Fort|Plymouth_Breakwaterplymouth_Breakwater_Fort| ,  |Fort_Bovisand|Fort_Bovisand| ,  |Staddon_Fort|Staddon_Fort|  and  |Stamford_Fort|Stamford_Fort| .     A  |harbour|Harbour|  and  |reservoir|Reservoir|  were built at Bovisand before the  |fort|Fort|  existed to supply  |men_o_war|Men_O_War|  anchored in the Sound with fresh water. Joseph Whidbey supervised the building of the Breakwater from  |Bovisand_Lodge|Bovisand_Lodge| , from which there is a view down the full length of the breakwater.     The  Titanic  was supposed to have docked here briefly on its return voyage to Britain, and the ship had a painting of Plymouth Sound on board.       The English Fleet assembled in 1355: by Edward of Woodstock, the  |Black_Prince|Black_Prince| ,  |Duke_of_Cornwall|Duke_Of_Cornwall| , departed to the  |Battle_of_Poitiers|Battle_Of_Poitiers| |_Pelican|Golden_Hind|  15 November 1577: departed on  |Sir_Francis_Drakes|Francis_Drake|  circumnavigation    |The_Mayflower|The_Mayflower|  1620, bearing the  |Pilgrim_Fathers|Pilgrim_Fathers| |_submarine|Submarine|  fatality in history occurred in the Sound in June 1774, when a  |carpenter|Carpenter|  named  |John_Day|John_Day|  perished north of Drakes Island while testing a wooden diving chamber attached to the sloop Maria.    Following his surrender to Captain  |Frederick_Maitland|Frederick_Lewis_Maitland|  of  off  |Rochefort|Rochefort_Charente_Maritime|  in 1815,  |Napoleon|Napoleon|  was taken to Plymouth Sound where he remained on board, 26 July â€“ 4 August, while his future was decided.  This event caused a local and national sensation as thousands took to the water; several paintings in Londons  |National_Maritime_Museum|National_Maritime_Museum|  document the event, such as the one shown here.   On 27 December 1831,  set off from anchorage in the Barn Pool, under  |Mount_Edgecumbe|Mount_Edgcumbe_Country_Park|  on the west side of Plymouth Sound, on her  |second_survey_voyage|Second_Voyage_Of_Hms_Beagle| , captained by  |Robert_FitzRoy|Robert_Fitzroy|  with  |Charles_Darwin|Charles_Darwin|  on board.

A  |Short_Sunderland|Short_Sunderland|  flying boat crashed in March 1942 between the Breakwater Fort and the breakwater lighthouse killing five passengers.   In February 1943, a  |Lancaster|Avro_Lancaster|  bomber hit the cable of a  |barrage_balloon|Barrage_Balloon|  and crashed without survivors on the return from a raid on the  |U_boat|U_Boat|  pens at  |Lorient|Lorient| .
