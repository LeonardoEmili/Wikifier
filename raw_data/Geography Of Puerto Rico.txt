     The geography of Puerto Rico consists of an  |archipelago|Archipelago|  located between the  |Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean_Sea|  and the North  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean| , east of the  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic| , west of the  |Virgin_Islands|Virgin_Islands|  and north of  |Venezuela|Venezuela| . The main island of Puerto Rico is the smallest and most eastern of the  |Greater_Antilles|Greater_Antilles| . With an area of , it is the  |third_largest_island_in_the_United_States|List_Of_Islands_Of_The_United_States_By_Area|  and the  |82nd_largest_island_in_the_world|List_Of_Islands_By_Area| . Various smaller  |islands_and_cays|List_Of_Islands_Of_Puerto_Rico| , including  |Vieques|Vieques,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Culebra|Culebra,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Mona|Mona,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Desecheo|Desecheo_Island| , and  |Caja_de_Muertos|Caja_De_Muertos,_Puerto_Rico|  comprise the remainder of the archipelago with only Culebra and Vieques being inhabited year-round. Mona is uninhabited through large parts of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.     The mainland measures some  by  , slightly larger than the  |U.S._state|U.S._State|  of  |Rhode_Island|Rhode_Island| . It is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south regions of the island. Some popular beaches on the north-west side of the island are Jobos Beach, Marias Beach, Domes Beach and Sandy Beach. The main mountainous range is called  La Cordillera Central  . The highest elevation point of Puerto Rico,  |Cerro_de_Punta|Cerro_De_Punta|  ,  is located in this range. Another important peak is  |El_Yunque|El_Yunque,_Puerto_Rico| , located in the  |Sierra_de_Luquillo|Sierra_De_Luquillo|  at the  |El_Yunque_National_Forest|El_Yunque_National_Forest| , with a maximum elevation of . The  |capital|Capital| ,  |San_Juan|San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico| , is located on the main islands north coast.       The archipelago of Puerto Rico is located between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, east of the Dominican Republic and west of the Virgin Islands. Located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, Puerto Rico was key to the Spanish Empire since the early years of exploration, conquest and colonization of the New World.        The  |topography|Topography|  of the main island is divided into three major regions: the mountainous region, which includes the  Cordillera Central ,  Sierra de Luquillo , Sierra de Cayey and Sierra Bermeja, the coastal plains and the northern  |karst|Karst_Topography|  region. The Cordillera Central extends through the entire island, dividing it into the northern and southern region. The mountain region accounts for approximately 60% of the land area.     The archipelago of  |Culebra|Culebra,_Puerto_Rico| , located east of Puerto Rico, north of  |Vieques|Vieques| , and west of the Virgin Islands, is composed of the main island of Culebra and 28 uninhabited islets.  Mainly mountainous, the island of Culebra possesses renowned beaches.          Located in the  |tropics|Tropics| , Puerto Rico enjoys an average temperature of  throughout the year. The seasons do not change very drastically. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than the rest of the island. The highest temperature record was in the Town of  |San_German|San_German|  with  and the minimum registration is  in  |Aibonito|Aibonito| . The dry season spans from November to May while the wet season coincides with the Atlantic hurricane season from June to November.          Puerto Rico has lakes    and more than  |50_rivers|List_Of_Puerto_Rico_Rivers| . Most of these rivers are born in the Cordillera Central, Puerto Ricos principal mountain range located across the center of the island. The rivers in the north of the island are bigger and with higher flow capacity than those of the south. The south is thus drier and hotter than the north. These rivers make up 60  |watersheds_throughout_the_island|Drainage_Basin| , where over 95% of the runoff goes back to sea.             As of 1998, . 239  |plants|Plant| , 16  |birds|Bird|  and 39  |amphibians|Amphibian| / |reptiles|Reptile|  have been discovered that are  |endemic|Endemism|  to the archipelago of Puerto Rico. The majority of these are found on the main island. The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride are the  |Coquís|Coquí|  , small frogs easily recognized by the sound from which they get their name.  |El_Yunque_National_Forest|El_Yunque_National_Forest| , a  |tropical_rainforest|Puerto_Rican_Moist_Forests| , is home to the majority of species of Coquí. It is also home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic, and 50 bird species, including the  |critically_endangered|Critically_Endangered| |Puerto_Rican_amazon|Puerto_Rican_Amazon|  .          Forests of Puerto Rico are well represented by the flora of the Luquillo Experimental Forest , a  |Long_Term_Ecological_Research_Network|Long_Term_Ecological_Research_Network|  site managed by the  |United_States_Forest_Service|United_States_Forest_Service|  and  |University_of_Puerto_Rico|University_Of_Puerto_Rico| . At this site, there are four main life zones, delineated on the basis of temperature and precipitation , in the Luquillo Mountains: subtropical wet and subtropical rain forests are found at low and mid elevations, lower montane rain and lower montane wet forests at high elevations. There is also an area of subtropical moist forest at low elevations on the southwest slope.     Tabonuco forest, so named for the dominant tabonuco tree , covers lower slopes to about . In well-developed stands the larger trees exceed  in height, there is a fairly continuous  |canopy|Canopy|  at , and the shaded  |understory|Understory|  is moderately dense. Tabonuco trees are especially large on ridges, where they are firmly rooted in the rocky substrate and connected by root grafts with each other. There are about 168 tree species in the tabonuco forest.     The Colorado forest, named for the large Colorado tree , begins above the tabonuco forest and extends up to about . Its canopy reaches only about . Soils are saturated and root mats above the soil are common. There are some 53 tree species in this forest type. At this same elevation, but in especially steep and wet areas, is palm forest, heavily dominated by the sierra palm . Patches of palm forest are also found in saturated  |riparian_areas|Riparian_Zone|  in the tabonuco forest. The palm forest reaches about 15 m in height.     At the highest elevations is  |dwarf_forest|Elfin_Forest| , a dense forest as short as , on saturated soils. Here the trees are covered with  |epiphytic|Epiphyte| |moss|Moss| es and vascular plants, especially  |bromeliads|Bromeliad| , and these also cover large areas of the ground. Ascending the Luquillo Mountains through these forest types, the average tree height and diameter, number of tree species, and basal area tend to decrease, while stem density increases.     There are more than 89 tree species in the LEF. The most common are Prestoea acuminata,  Casearia arborea , Dacryodes excelsa,  Manilkara bidentata ,  Inga laurina , and  Sloanea berteroana . Common shrub species are  Palicourea croceoides ,  Psychotria berteriana , and  Piper glabrescens .  |Grass|Grass| es,  |ferns|Fern| , and  |forbs|Forb|  are frequent on the ground, especially in canopy gaps; epiphytes are fairly common, and vines are uncommon.       |Puerto_Rican_dry_forests|Puerto_Rican_Dry_Forests|  are dominated by plants in the families  |Rubiaceae|Rubiaceae| ,  |Euphorbiaceae|Euphorbiaceae| , and  |Myrtaceae|Myrtaceae| . In this regard they are similar to  |Jamaican_dry_forests|Jamaican_Dry_Forests| , but differ sharply from dry forests on the mainland of  |South|South_America|  and  |Central_America|Central_America| , which are dominated by  |Fabaceae|Fabaceae|  and  |Bignoniaceae|Bignoniaceae| .

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.     Mario Javier Fernandez-Vega is a Puerto Rican forester who uses  |silvicultural|Silviculture|  techniques. Fernandez is currently developing cutting edge forestry methods known as the Borincano Model . The model capitalizes on the diversity of ecological niches in Puerto Rican forests and native disturbance regimes to formulate practices uniquely suited to the forests of the territory. About his model Fernandez has been known to comment, Soy de aquí como el coquí I am from here just like the Coquí, a common patriotic axiom that is used to demonstrate their native ties to the island. Although incorrect, many believe that the Coquí and its unique vocalizations are indigenous to the island of Puerto Rico. In fact however, there are thriving populations of Coquís that, like the people of Puerto Rico, have been transported to the island of Hawaii. The Coquí is viewed as an ecological menace in Hawaii where its song of co kee co kee is found to be an irritant by many. Needless to say that efforts to eradicate its presence in Hawaii is not a popular issue among Puerto Ricans.           Puerto Rico is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south. The main mountain range is called  |La_Cordillera_Central|Cordillera_Central|  . The highest elevation in Puerto Rico,  |Cerro_de_Punta|Cerro_De_Punta|  , . is located in this range. Another important peak is  |El_Yunque|El_Yunque,_Puerto_Rico| , one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the  |El_Yunque_National_Forest|El_Yunque_National_Forest| , with an elevation of .           Puerto Rico is composed of  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  to  |Eocene|Eocene| |volcanic|Volcanic|  and  |plutonic|Plutonic|  rocks, which are overlain by younger  |Oligocene|Oligocene|  to recent  |carbonates|Carbonate|  and other  |sedimentary_rocks|Sedimentary_Rock| . Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern Oligocene to recent carbonates. The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old  and are located at  |Sierra_Bermeja|Sierra_Bermeja|  in the southwest part of the island. These rocks may represent part of the  |oceanic_crust|Oceanic_Crust|  and are believed to come from the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean|  realm. Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American  |plates|Tectonic_Plate| . This means that it is currently being deformed by the  |tectonic|Tectonics|  stresses caused by the interaction of these plates. These stresses may cause  |earthquakes|Earthquakes|  and  |tsunamis|Tsunami| . These  |seismic|Seismic|  events, along with  |landslides|Landslide| , represent some of the most dangerous  |geologic_hazards|Geologic_Hazards|  in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11, 1918, with seismic moment estimated at 7.5 on the  |moment_magnitude_scale|Moment_Magnitude_Scale| .  It originated off the coast of Aguadilla and was accompanied by a tsunami.      Lying about  north of Puerto Rico in the Atlantic Ocean at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates is the  |Puerto_Rico_Trench|Puerto_Rico_Trench| , the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic. The trench is  long and about  wide. At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Depth, it is 27,493 ft deep, or about .             As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico does not have any first-order administrative divisions as defined by the  |U.S._Government|U.S._Government| , but there are 78  |municipalities|Municipalities|  at the second level. Municipalities are further subdivided into  barrio s, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a  |mayor|Mayor|  and a municipal legislature elected for a 4-year term.       The first municipality of Puerto Rico, San Juan, was founded in 1521. In the 16th century two more municipalities were established,  |Coamo|Coamo|  and  |San_Germán|San_Germán|  . Three more municipalities were established in the 17th century. These were  |Arecibo|Arecibo|  ,  |Aguada|Aguada,_Puerto_Rico|  and  |Ponce|Ponce,_Puerto_Rico|  . The 18th and 19th century saw an increase in settlement in Puerto Rico with 30 municipalities being established in the 18th century and 34 more in the 19th century. Only six municipalities were founded in the 20th century with the last,  |Florida|Florida,_Puerto_Rico| , being founded in 1971.  .         Under Spanish rule, as of the 1880s, Puerto Rico was subdivided into regional districts  that contained smaller  |ayuntamientes|Ayuntamiento|  :    Aguadilla district    Ayuntamientes: Aguada,  |Aguadilla|Aguadilla,_Puerto_Rico| , Isabella, Lares, Moca, Rincon, San Sebastian    Arecibo district    Ayuntamientes: Arecibo, Barceloneta, Camuy, Ciales, Hatillo, Manati, Morovi, Quebradillas, Utuado   Bayamon district    Ayuntamientes:  |Bayamón|Bayamón,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Carolina|Carolina,_Puerto_Rico| , Corozal, Dorado, Loiza, Naranjito, Rio Grande, Rio Piedras, Toa Alta,  |Toa_Baja|Toa_Baja,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Trujillo_Alto|Trujillo_Alto,_Puerto_Rico| , Vega Alta,  |Vega_Baja|Vega_Baja,_Puerto_Rico|    Capital: San Juan   Guayama district    Ayuntamientes: Aguas Buenas, Arroyo,  |Caguas|Caguas,_Puerto_Rico| , Cayey, Cidra,  |Guayama|Guayama,_Puerto_Rico| , Gurabo, Hato Grande, Juncos, Sabana del Palmar, Salinas   Humacao district    Ayuntamientes: Ceiba, Fajardo,  |Humacao|Humacao,_Puerto_Rico| , Luquillo, Maunabo, Naguabo, Patillas, Piedras, Vieques, Yabucoa   Mayagüez district    Ayuntamientes: Anasco, Cabo Rojo, Hormigueros, Lajas, Las Marias, Maricao,  |Mayagüez|Mayagüez,_Puerto_Rico| , Sabana Grande, San German   Ponce district    Ayuntamientes: Adjuntas, Aibonito, Barranquitas, Barros, Coamo, Guayanilla,  |Juana_Diaz|Juana_Díaz,_Puerto_Rico| .
