It is also a founding member of  |Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation|Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation|   and the  |East_Asia_Summit|East_Asia_Summit| .     On January 1, 2007,  |South_Korean_Foreign_Minister|Ministry_Of_Foreign_Affairs| |Ban_Ki-moon|Ban_Ki-Moon|  assumed the post of  |UN_Secretary-General|United_Nations_Secretary-General| , serving in that post until December 31, 2016.               Inter-Korean relations may be divided into five periods. The first stage was between 1972 and 1973; the second stage was  |Pyongyang|Pyongyang|  North Koreas delivery of relief goods to South Korea after a typhoon caused devastating floods in 1984 and the third stage was the exchange of home visits and performing artists in 1985. The fourth stage, activated by Nordpolitik under Roh, was represented by expanding public and private contacts between the two Koreas. The fifth stage was improved following the 1997 election of  |Kim_Dae-jung|Kim_Dae-Jung| . His  |Sunshine_Policy|Sunshine_Policy|  of engagement with North Korea set the stage for the historic June 2000  |Inter-Korean_summit|Inter-Korean_Summit| .     The possibility of  |Korean_reunification|Korean_Reunification|  has remained a prominent topic. However, no peace treaty has yet been signed with the North. In June 2000, a historic first North Korea-South Korea summit took place, part of the South Koreas continuing  |Sunshine_Policy|Sunshine_Policy|  of engagement. Since then, regular contacts have led to a cautious thaw. President Kim was awarded the  |Nobel_Peace_Prize|Nobel_Peace_Prize|  in 2000 for the policy.     With that policy, continued by the following administration of president  |Roh_Moo-hyun|Roh_Moo-Hyun| , economic ties between the two countries have increased, humanitarian aid has been sent to North Korea and some divided families have been briefly reunited.  |Military|Military|  ties remain fraught with tension, however, and in 2002 a brief naval skirmish left four South Korean sailors dead, leaving the future of the Sunshine policy uncertain. The North Korea cut off talks but the South remained committed to the policy of reconciliation and relations began to thaw again. The resurgence of the  |nuclear|Nuclear_Weapon|  issue two years later would again cast relations in doubt, but South Korea has sought to play the role of intermediary rather than antagonist, and economic ties at the time seemed to be growing again.     Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by  |North_Korean_missile_tests|North_Korean_Missile_Tests|  in  |1993|1993_North_Korean_Missile_Test| ,  |1998|1998_North_Korean_Missile_Test| ,  |2006|2006_North_Korean_Nuclear_Test|  and  |2009|2009_North_Korean_Nuclear_Test| . , relationships between North Korea and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles,  Ended its former agreements with South Korea  and threatened South Korea and  |the_United_States|The_United_States|  not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned.    As of 2009 North Korea and South Korea are still opposed and share a heavily fortified border.      On May 27, 2009 North Korea media declared that the armistice is no longer valid due to the South Korean governments pledge to definitely join the  |Proliferation_Security_Initiative|Proliferation_Security_Initiative| . To further complicate and intensify strains between the two nations, the  |sinking_of_the_South_Korean_warship_Cheonan|Roks_Cheonan_Sinking|  in March 2010, killing 46 seamen, is as of May 20, 2010 claimed by a team of researchers around the world  to have been caused by a North Korean torpedo, which the North denies. South Korea agreed with the findings from the research group and president  |Lee_Myung-bak|Lee_Myung-Bak|  declared in May 2010 that  |Seoul|Seoul|  would cut all trade with North Korea as part of measures primarily aimed at striking back at North Korea diplomatically and financially.   As a result of this, North Korea severed all ties and completely abrogated the previous pact of non aggression. , by Jonathan Thatcher, Reuters, 25-05-2010     In November 2010, Unification Ministry officially declared the Sunshine Policy a failure, thus bringing the policy to an end.

Active South Korean-Chinese people-to-people contacts have been encouraged. Academics, journalists and particularly families divided between South Korea and the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s.

South Korea had long been an ally of  |Taiwan|Taiwan| . Diplomatic ties between Seoul and  |Taipei|Taipei|  were nevertheless severed in 1992. Formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and  |Beijing|Beijing|  on August 24, 1992.     In 2004 the  |PRC|Prc|  government began the  |Northeast_Project|Northeast_Project|  This sparked a massive uproar in South Korea when the project was widely publicized.      After the  |KORUS_FTA|Korus_Fta|   was finalized on June 30, 2007 the  |Chinese|China|  government has immediately begun seeking an  |FTA|Free_Trade_Agreement|  agreement with South Korea.  The  |FTA|Free_Trade_Agreement|  between Korea and  |China|China|  are under discussion South Korea has been running a  |trade_surplus|Trade_Surplus|  with  |China|China|  which hit a record US$32.5 billion in 2009.             On 23 August 1992, the  |Taiwan|Taiwan| ese government  severed diplomatic relations with South Korea in advance of its announcement of formal recognition of the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  based in  |Beijing|Beijing| ,  |China|China| . The  |Yonhap_News|Yonhap_News|  said in 2002 that since then relations between the two  |governments|Governments|  have been in a rut .                   The relation between South Korea and  |Japan|Japan|  has both political conflicts and economic intimacies. Examples of conflicts include the  |East_sea_naming_dispute|Sea_Of_Japan_Naming_Dispute| , visits by successive Japanese  |Prime_Ministers|Prime_Ministers|  to the  |Yasukuni_Shrine|Yasukuni_Shrine|  and the disputed ownership of  |Dokdo|Dokdo|  of the  |island|Island|  Korea.     On January 18, 1952 The first president of South Korea  |Syngman_Rhee|Syngman_Rhee|  declared that the vicinity of  |Dokdo|Dokdo|  was a territory of South Korea . Subsequently, some 3,000  |Japanese|Japanese_People|  fishermen who conducted fishery operations in this vicinity were captured. This incident, called the  |Dai_Ichi_Daihoumaru_Ship_case|Dai_Ichi_Daihoumaru_Ship_Case|  strained relations between South Korea and Japan.     June 22, 1965, The president in South Korea  |Park_Chung-hee|Park_Chung-Hee|  concluded the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and South Korea As a result, Japan considered South Korea to be the legitimate successor of its rule over the  |Korean_Peninsula|Korean_Peninsula| .     South Koreas trade with  |Japan|Japan|  was US$892.1 million in 2008, with a surplus of nearly US$327.1 million on the Japanese side.   Japanese and South Koreans firms often had interdependent relations, which gave Japan advantages in South Koreas growing market.     In 1996  |FIFA|Fifa|  announced that the South Korea-Japan would jointly host the  |2002_FIFA_World_Cup|2002_Fifa_World_Cup| . The next few years would see leaders of both countries meet to warm relations in preparations for the games.  The year 2005 was designated as the Japan-South Korea Friendship Year .     However, the  |Liancourt_Rocks|Liancourt_Rocks|  controversy erupted again when Japans  |Shimane_prefecture|Shimane_Prefecture|  declared Takeshima Day , inciting mass demonstrations in South Korea.               Both countries established diplomatic relations on March 26, 1990. South Korea has an embassy in  |Ulaanbaatar|Ulaanbaatar| |Mongolia|Mongolia| .    |Mongolia|Mongolia|  has an embassy in Seoul.               According to a 2013  |BBC_World|Bbc_World|  Service Poll, 3% of South Koreans view the  |Democratic_Peoples_Republic_of_Koreas|Democratic_Peoples_Republic_Of_Korea|  influence positively, with 91% expressing a negative view.    BBC  A 2015 government-sponsored poll revealed that 41% of South Koreans consider North Korea to be an enemy, with negative views being more prevalent among younger respondents.  Still, in a 2017 poll, 58% of South Koreans said they dont expect another war to break out with North Korea.             Since the establishment of diplomatic ties on 3 March 1949, the relationship between the  |Philippines|Philippines|  and South Korea has flourished. The Philippines was one of the first countries that extended diplomatic recognition to South Korea. This was cemented with the  |Philippine|Philippine|  governments deployment of the  |Philippine|Philippine|  Expeditionary Force to Korea  to help South Korea against the  |invasion|Invasion|  of the  |communist|Communist|  North during the  |Korean_War|Korean_War|  in the 1950s. After the war, the Philippines provided development assistance to South Korea and helped the country rebuild itself.     Since then, the Philippiness relations with South Korea have evolved with South Korea becoming one of the Philippiness most important bilateral partners aside from the United States,  |China|China|  and Japan. The  |Philippine|Philippine|  government seeks to cultivate strategic ties with South Korea given its increasing presence in the country. In the coming years, the Philippines anticipates to benefit from exploring unprecedented opportunities from South Korea that shall contribute significantly to the countrys trade and economy, defense and security, and society and culture.                 In the 1980s South Korean president  |Roh_Tae_Woos|Roh_Tae_Woo| |Nordpolitik|Nordpolitik|  and  |Mikhail_Gorbachevs|Mikhail_Gorbachev|  New Thinking were both attempts to reverse their nations recent histories.  |Gorbachev|Gorbachev|  had signaled  |Soviet|Soviet|  interest in improving relations with all countries in the  |Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific|  region including South Korea as explained in his July 1986  |Vladivostok|Vladivostok|  and August 1988  |Krasnoyarsk|Krasnoyarsk|  speeches.     In initiating  |Nordpolitik|Nordpolitik|  Rohs confidential  |foreign_policy|Foreign_Policy|  adviser was rumored to have visited  |Moscow|Moscow| |Russia|Russia|  to consult with Soviet policymakers.  |Kim_Young_Sam|Kim_Young_Sam|  visited  |Moscow|Moscow| |Russian_Federation|Russian_Federation|  from June 2 to June 10, 1989 as the  |Kremlin|Kremlin|  announced that it would allow some 300,000 Soviet-South Koreans who had been on the Soviet  |island|Island|  of  |Sahkalin|Sahkalin|  since the end of  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  to return permanently to South Korea.  |Moscow|Moscow|  even arranged Kims meeting with the  |North_Korea|North_Korea| n  |ambassador|Ambassador|  to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  In June 1990, Roh held his first summit with president  |Gorbachev|Gorbachev|  in  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco| , United States.     South Korea and the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  established diplomatic relations on September 30, 1990. These relations continued by the  |Russian_Federation|Russian_Federation|  on December 27, 1991.  |Russia|Russia| n president  |Vladimir_Putin|Vladimir_Putin|  visited Seoul in February 2001 while South Korean president  |Roh_Moo-hyun|Roh_Moo-Hyun|  visited  |Moscow|Moscow| |Russia|Russia|  in September 2004.        |Russian_Federal_Space_Agency|Russian_Federal_Space_Agency|  and the  |Korean_Astronaut_Program|Korean_Astronaut_Program|  cooperated together to send South Koreas first astronaut into space.  |Yi_So-Yeon|Yi_So-Yeon|  became the first South Korean national as well as the third woman to be the first national in space on 8 April 2008 when  |Soyuz_TMA-12|Soyuz_Tma-12|  departed from  |Baikonur_Cosmodrome|Baikonur_Cosmodrome| .

The United States engaged in the decolonization of Korea from Japan after World War II. After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established. Upon the onset of the  |Korean_War|Korean_War| , U.S. forces were sent to defend South Korea against invasion by North Korea and later China. Following the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a Mutual Defense Treaty , under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a response from both.      In 1968, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| . The  |U.S._Eighth_Army|Us_Eighth_Army| ,  |Seventh_Air_Force|Seventh_Air_Force| , and  |U.S._Naval_Forces_Korea|Commander_Naval_Forces_Korea|  are stationed in South Korea. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Koreas industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.      Since the late 1980s, the country has instead sought to establish an American partnership, which has made the Seoul   |Washington|Washington,_D.C.|  relationship subject to severe strains. Trade had become a serious source of friction between the two countries. In 1989, the United States was South Koreas largest and most important trading partner and South Korea was the seventh-largest market for United States goods and the second largest market for its agricultural products.     From  |Roh_Tae-woos|Roh_Tae-Woo|  administration to  |Roh_Moo_Hyuns|Roh_Moo_Hyun|  administration, South Korea sought to establish a U.S. partnership, which has made the Seoul   |Washington|Washington,_D.C.|  relationship subject to some strains. In 2007, a  |free_trade_agreement|Free_Trade_Agreement|  known as the  |Republic_of_Korea-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement|Republic_Of_Korea-United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement|  was reportedly signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation has been repeatedly delayed, pending further approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries.     The relations between the United States and South Korea have greatly strengthened under the  |Lee_Myung-bak|Lee_Myung-Bak|  administration. At the  |2009_G-20_London_summit|2009_G-20_London_Summit| , U.S. President Barack Obama called South Korea one of Americas closest allies and greatest friends.          However, some  |anti-American_sentiment_in_South_Korea|Anti-American_Sentiment_In_South_Korea|  still exists; The United States alleged role in the May 1980 Gwangju uprising was a pressing South Korean political issue of the 1980s. Even after a decade, some Gwangju citizens and other South Koreans still blamed the United States for its perceived involvement in the bloody uprising. In 2008, the  |protests_against_U.S._beef|2008_Us_Beef_Protest_In_South_Korea|  was a center of a major controversy that year.     In a June 2010 open letter from  |President_of_South_Korea|President_Of_South_Korea| |Lee_Myung-bak|Lee_Myung-Bak|  published in the Los Angeles Times, he expressed gratitude for the 37,000 Americans who were killed in the Korean War defending South Korea, saying that they fought for the freedom of South Koreans they did not even know. He stated that thanks to their sacrifices, the peace and democracy of the South Korean state was protected. On this significant occasion, all Koreans pay tribute to the heroes fallen in defense of freedom and democracy. I firmly believe that future generations in both countries will further advance the strong the Republic of Korea- |the_United_States_of_America|The_United_States_Of_America|  alliance into one befitting the spirit of the new age.     The U.S. states that The Alliance is adapting to changes in the 21st Century security environment. We will maintain a robust defense posture, backed by allied capabilities which support both nations security interests We will continue to deepen our strong bilateral economic, trade and investment relations In the Asia-Pacific region we will work jointly with regional institutions and partners to foster prosperity, keep the peace, and improve the daily lives of the people of the region The  |United_States|United_States|  and South Korea will work to achieve our common Alliance goals through strategic cooperation at every level. U.S. Government       The  |European_Union|European_Union|  and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a  |free_trade_agreement|Free_Trade_Agreement|  for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority  |FTA|Free_Trade_Agreement|  partner in 2006. The  |free_trade_agreement|Free_Trade_Agreement|  has been approved in September 2010, following  |Italys|Italy|  conditional withdrawal of its veto of the  |free_trade_agreement|Free_Trade_Agreement| .  The compromise made by  |Italy|Italy|  was that  |free_trade_agreement|Free_Trade_Agreement|  would take provisional effect on July 1, 2011. South Korea is the EUs eighth largest trade partner and the EU has become South Koreas second largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded €65 billion in 2008 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 7.5% between 2004 and 2008.      The EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962 and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into South Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in South Korea market due to stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its  |FTA|Free_Trade_Agreement|  with South Korea The EU is seeking to improve this situation.
