                    Her Majestys Most Honourable Privy Council, commonly known as the Privy Council of the United Kingdom or simply the Privy Council, is a  |formal_body_of_advisers|Privy_Council|  to the  |Sovereign|British_Monarchy|  of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| . Its membership mainly comprises  |senior_politicians|Politics_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  who are current or former members of either the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  or the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords| .     The Privy Council formally advises the sovereign on the exercise of the  |Royal_Prerogative|Royal_Prerogative_In_The_United_Kingdom| , and corporately  it issues  |executive_instruments|Executive|  known as  |Orders_in_Council|Order_In_Council| , which among other powers enact  |Acts_of_Parliament|Act_Of_Parliament| . The Council also holds the delegated authority to issue  |Orders_of_Council|Order_Of_Council| , mostly used to regulate certain public institutions. The Council advises the sovereign on the issuing of  |Royal_Charters|Royal_Charter| , which are used to grant special status to incorporated bodies, and  |city|City_Status_In_The_United_Kingdom|  or  |borough|Borough|  status to local authorities. Otherwise, the Privy Councils powers have now been largely replaced by its executive committee, the  |Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom| .     Certain judicial functions are also performed by the Queen-in-Council, although in practice its actual work of hearing and deciding upon cases is carried out day-to-day by the  |Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council|Judicial_Committee_Of_The_Privy_Council| . The Judicial Committee consists of  |senior_judges|List_Of_Lords_Justices_Of_Appeal|  appointed as Privy Counsellors: predominantly  |Justices|Justice_Of_The_Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  of the  |Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and  |senior_judges|Senior_Judge|  from the  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| . The Privy Council formerly acted as the  |High_Court_of_Appeal|Supreme_Court|  for the entire  |British_Empire|British_Empire|  , and continues to hear  |appeals|Appeal|  from the  |Crown_Dependencies|Crown_Dependencies| , the  |British_Overseas_Territories|British_Overseas_Territories| , and some independent Commonwealth  |states|Member_States_Of_The_Commonwealth_Of_Nations| .          The  |Privy_Council|Privy_Council|  of the United Kingdom was preceded by the Privy Council of Scotland and the Privy Council of England. The key events in the formation of the modern Privy Council are given below:     In  |Anglo_Saxon_England|Anglo_Saxon_England| ,  |Witenagemot|Witenagemot|  was an early equivalent to the  |Privy_Council_of_England|Privy_Council_Of_England| . During the reigns of the  |Norman_monarchs|Norman_Conquest| , the  |English_Crown|English_Crown|  was advised by a  |royal_court|Royal_Court|  or  curia regis , which consisted of  |magnates|Magnate| ,  |ecclesiastics|Ecclesiastic|  and  |high_officials|Law_Officers_Of_The_Crown| . The body originally concerned itself with advising the sovereign on legislation, administration and justice. Dicey, pp. 6–7. Later, different bodies assuming distinct functions evolved from the court. The courts of law took over the business of dispensing  |justice|Justice| , while  |Parliament|Parliament_Of_England|  became the supreme legislature of the kingdom. Dicey, p. 24. Nevertheless, the Council retained the power to hear legal disputes, either in the first instance or on appeal. Dicey, pp. 12–14. Furthermore, laws made by the sovereign on the advice of the Council, rather than on the advice of Parliament, were accepted as valid. Gay, p. 2. Powerful sovereigns often used the body to circumvent the Courts and Parliament. For example, a committee of the Council—which later became the  |Court_of_the_Star_Chamber|Star_Chamber| —was during the 15th century permitted to inflict any punishment except death, without being bound by normal  |court_procedure|Trial| . Maitland, pp. 262–3. During  |Henry_VIIIs|Henry_Viii_Of_England|  reign, the sovereign, on the advice of the Council, was allowed to enact laws by mere proclamation. The legislative pre-eminence of Parliament was not restored until after Henry VIIIs death. Maitland, p. 253. Though the royal Council retained legislative and judicial responsibilities, it became a primarily administrative body. Goodnow, p. 123 The Council consisted of forty members in 1553, Maitland, p. 256. but the sovereign relied on a smaller committee, which later evolved into the modern  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom| .     By the end of the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War| , the monarchy, House of Lords, and Privy Council had been abolished. The remaining  |parliamentary_chamber|Chambers_Of_Parliament| , the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_England| , instituted a  |Council_of_State|English_Council_Of_State|  to execute laws and to direct administrative policy. The forty-one members of the Council were elected by the House of Commons; the body was headed by  |Oliver_Cromwell|Oliver_Cromwell| ,  de facto  military dictator of the nation. In 1653, however, Cromwell became  |Lord_Protector|Lord_Protector| , and the Council was reduced to between thirteen and twenty-one members, all elected by the Commons. In 1657, the Commons granted Cromwell even greater powers, some of which were reminiscent of those enjoyed by monarchs. The Council became known as the  |Protectors_Privy_Council|Protectors_Privy_Council| ; its members were appointed by the Lord Protector, subject to Parliaments approval.      In 1659, shortly before the  |restoration_of_the_monarchy|English_Restoration| , the Protectors Council was abolished.  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_England|  restored the Royal Privy Council, but he, like previous  |Stuart|House_Of_Stuart|  monarchs, chose to rely on a small group of advisers. Warshaw, p. 7. Under  |George_I|George_I_Of_Great_Britain|  even more power transferred to this committee. It now began to meet in the absence of the sovereign, communicating its decisions to him after the fact.     Thus, the British Privy Council, as a whole, ceased to be a body of important confidential advisers to the sovereign; the role passed to a committee of the Council, now known as the  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom| . Gay and Rees, pp. 2–3.       According to the  Oxford English Dictionary , the definition of the word  privy  in Privy Council is an obsolete meaning of or pertaining exclusively to a particular person or persons, ones own ;  hence the Council is personal to the sovereign. It is closely related to the word  private , and derives from the  |French|French_Language|  word  privé .          The sovereign, when acting on the Councils advice, is known as the  King-in-Council  or  Queen-in-Council .  The members of the Council are collectively known as The Lords of Her Majestys Most Honourable Privy Council e.g.  . e.g.  The chief officer of the body is the  |Lord_President_of_the_Council|Lord_President_Of_The_Council| , who is the fourth highest  |Great_Officer_of_State|Great_Officer_Of_State| , H.  Cox, p. 388. a  |Cabinet_member|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and normally, either the Leader of the House of Lords or of the House of Commons.  Another important official is the  |Clerk|Clerk_Of_The_Privy_Council| , whose signature is appended to all orders made in the Council. Brazier, p. 199, note 109.     Both Privy Counsellor and Privy Councillor may be correctly used to refer to a member of the Council. The former, however, is preferred by the  |Privy_Council_Office|Privy_Council_Office| ,  emphasising English usage of the term Counsellor as one who gives  |counsel|Counsel|  , as opposed to one who is a member of a council . A Privy Counsellor is traditionally said to be sworn of the Council after being received by the sovereign.      The sovereign may appoint anyone a Privy Counsellor, Blackstone, I. 174. but in practice appointments are made only on the advice of  |Her_Majestys_Government|Her_Majestys_Government| . The majority of appointees are senior politicians, including Ministers of the Crown, the few most senior figures of the  |Loyal_Opposition|Her_Majestys_Most_Loyal_Opposition| , the Parliamentary leader of the third-largest party, a couple of the most senior figures in the devolved British governments and senior politicians from Commonwealth countries. Besides these, the Council includes a very few members of the  |Royal_Family|British_Royal_Family|  , a few dozen judges from British and Commonwealth countries, a few clergy and a small number of senior civil servants.     There is no statutory limit to its membership: Gay, p. 3. at January 2012, there were about 600 members;  they had risen in number to over 650 by June 2015.      However, the members have no automatic right to attend all Privy Council meetings, and only some are summoned regularly to meetings .     The  |Church_of_Englands|Church_Of_England|  three senior  |bishops|Bishop|  – the  |Archbishop_of_Canterbury|Archbishop_Of_Canterbury| , the  |Archbishop_of_York|Archbishop_Of_York|  and the  |Bishop_of_London|Bishop_Of_London|   – become Privy Counsellors upon appointment. Senior members of the Royal Family may also be appointed, but this is confined to the current consort and heir apparent and consort.  |Prince_Philip|Prince_Philip|  is at present the most senior member by length of service, and he is the only current Privy Counsellor not appointed by the  |reigning_monarch|Elizabeth_Ii| , having been sworn of the Council by  |her_father|George_Vi| . The  |Private_Secretary_to_the_Sovereign|Private_Secretary_To_The_Sovereign|  is always appointed a Privy Counsellor,  as are the  |Lord_Chamberlain|Lord_Chamberlain| , the  |Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons|Speaker_Of_The_House_Of_Commons| , and the  |Lord_Speaker|Lord_Speaker| .  |Justices|Justice_Of_The_Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  of the  |Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_Kingdom| ,  judges of the  |Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales|Court_Of_Appeal_Of_England_And_Wales| ,  senior judges of the  |Inner_House_of_the_Court_of_Session|Court_Of_Session|   and the  |Lord_Chief_Justice_of_Northern_Ireland|Lord_Chief_Justice_Of_Northern_Ireland|   also join the Privy Council ex officio.     The balance of Privy Counsellors is largely made up of  |politicians|Politician| . The Prime Minister,  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom| |_ministers|Minister|  and the  |Leader_of_HM_Opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition|  are traditionally sworn of the Privy Council upon appointment. Leaders of major  |parties|Political_Parties_In_The_United_Kingdom|  in the House of Commons,  |First_Ministers|First_Minister|  of the  |devolved_assemblies|Devolution| ,  some senior  |Ministers|Minister|  outside Cabinet, and on occasion other respected senior parliamentarians are appointed Privy Counsellors.     Because Privy Counsellors are bound by  |oath|Oath|  to keep matters discussed at Council meetings secret, the appointment of the Leaders of Opposition Parties as Privy Counsellors allows the Government to share confidential information with them on Privy Council terms . This usually only happens in special circumstances, such as in matters of  |national_security|National_Security| . For example,  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  met  |Iain_Duncan_Smith|Iain_Duncan_Smith|  and  |Charles_Kennedy|Charles_Kennedy|   on Privy Council terms to discuss the  |evidence_for_Iraqs_weapons_of_mass_destruction|September_Dossier| .      Although the Privy Council is primarily a British institution, officials from some other  |Commonwealth_realms|Commonwealth_Realm|  are also appointed. By 2000, the most notable instance was New Zealand, whose  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_New_Zealand| , senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed Privy Counsellors.  However, appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued. The  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_New_Zealand| , the  |Speaker|Speaker_Of_The_New_Zealand_House_Of_Representatives| , the  |Governor_General|Governor_General_Of_New_Zealand|  and the  |Chief_Justice_of_New_Zealand|Chief_Justice_Of_New_Zealand|  are still accorded the  |style|Style|   Right Honourable , but without membership of the Council.  Until the late 20th century, the Prime Ministers and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed Privy Counsellors.   Canada also has its own Privy Council, the  |Queens_Privy_Council_for_Canada|Queens_Privy_Council_For_Canada|  . Prime Ministers of some other Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as their sovereign continue to be sworn of the Council.          It was formerly regarded by the Privy Council as criminal, and possibly  |treason|Treason| ous, to disclose the  |oath|Oath|  administered to Privy Counsellors as they take office.  However, the oath was officially made public by the  |Blair_Government|Blair_Ministry|  in a written parliamentary answer in 1998, as follows.  It had also been read out in full in the House of Lords during debate by  |Lord_Rankeillour|James_Hope_1St_Baron_Rankeillour|  on 21 December 1932.           A form of this oath dates back to at least 1570. Joseph Robson Tanner, Tudor Constitutional Documents: A.D. 1485-1603, with an Historical Commentary , p. 225.      |Privy_counsellors|Privy_Counsellor|  can choose to  |affirm|Affirmation_In_Law|  their allegiance in similar terms, should they prefer not to take a religious oath.  At the induction ceremony, the order of precedence places  |Anglicans|Anglicans|   before others.      The initiation ceremony for newly appointed privy counsellors is held in private, and typically requires kneeling on a stool before the sovereign and then  |kissing_hands|Kissing_Hands| . , BBC News . , Guardian . According to The Royal Encyclopaedia |republicanism|Republicanism_In_The_United_Kingdom| ;  |Tony_Benn|Tony_Benn|  said in his diaries that he kissed his own thumb, rather than the Queens hand, while  |Jeremy_Corbyn|Jeremy_Corbyn|  reportedly did not kneel. Not all members of the privy council go through the initiation ceremony; appointments are frequently made by an  |Order_in_Council|Order_In_Council| , although it is rare for a party leader to use such a course.        Membership is conferred for life. Formerly, the death of a monarch  brought an immediate dissolution of the Council, as all  |Crown_appointments|Royal_Prerogative_In_The_United_Kingdom|  automatically lapsed. Blackstone, I. 176. By the 18th century, it was enacted that the Council would not be dissolved until up to six months after the demise of the Crown. The most recent enactment deferring dissolution was the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 .  as originally enacted. . Section VIII provided, ... the Privy Council of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors for the Kingdom of Great Britain, shall not be determined or dissolved by the death or demise of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors; but such Privy Council shall continue and act as such by the space of six months next after such demise, unless sooner determined by the next successor to whom the imperial Crown of this realm is limited and appointed to go, remain, and descend; ... Despite becoming obsolete in 1901, this section remained on the statute book until it was repealed by the Statute Law Act 1973 , section 1 and Schedule 1 part I. By convention, however, the sovereign would reappoint all members of the Council after its dissolution. H.  Cox, p. 389. See, for example, the proclamation following the accession of  |Queen_Victoria|Victoria_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  on the death of  |William_IV|William_Iv_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  In practice, therefore, membership continued without a break. In 1901, the  |law|Law_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  was changed to ensure that Crown Appointments became wholly unaffected by any succession of monarch. The Demise of the Crown Act 1901 ,  , . Section 1 provides, The holding of any office under the Crown, whether within or without His Majestys dominions, shall not be affected, nor shall any fresh appointment thereto be rendered necessary, by the demise of the Crown. The act came into force within six months of the death of Victoria and section 1 ensured that no offices were vacated on the subsequent accession of Edward VII. See also commentary in Appendix 2 of the report that preceded the 1973 Act:  .     The sovereign, however, may remove an individual from the Privy Council. Former MP  |Elliot_Morley|Elliot_Morley|  was expelled on 8 June 2011, following his  |conviction|Conviction|  on charges of false accounting in connection with the  |British_parliamentary_expenses_scandal|United_Kingdom_Parliamentary_Expenses_Scandal| .   Before this, the last individual to be expelled from the Council against his will was  |Sir_Edgar_Speyer_Bt_|Edgar_Speyer| , who was removed on 13 December 1921   for collaborating with the enemy  |German_Empire|German_Empire| , during the  |First_World_War|World_War_I| .     Individuals can choose to resign, sometimes to avoid expulsion. Three members voluntarily left the Privy Council in the 20th century:  |John_Profumo|John_Profumo| , who resigned on 26 June 1963;    |John_Stonehouse|John_Stonehouse| , who resigned on 17 August 1976  and  |Jonathan_Aitken|Jonathan_Aitken| , who resigned on 25 June 1997  following allegations of  |perjury|Perjury| .       So far, three Privy Counsellors have resigned in the 21st century, coincidentally all in the same year. On 4 February 2013,  |Chris_Huhne|Chris_Huhne|  announced that he would voluntarily leave the Privy Council after pleading guilty to  |perverting_the_course_of_justice|Perverting_The_Course_Of_Justice| .   |Lord_Prescott|John_Prescott|  stood down on 6 July 2013, in protest against delays in the introduction of press regulation, expecting others to follow.   |Denis_MacShane|Denis_Macshane|  resigned on 9 October 2013, before a High Court hearing at which he pleaded guilty of false accounting and was subsequently imprisoned.           Meetings of the Privy Council are normally held once each month wherever the sovereign may be in residence at the time.  The  |quorum|Quorum| , according to the Privy Council Office, is three,  though some statutes provide for other quorums .     The sovereign attends the meeting, though his or her place may be taken by two or more  |Counsellors_of_State|Counsellors_Of_State| . Gay and Rees, p. 4.  Under the Regency Acts 1937 to 1953,   |Counsellors_of_State|Counsellor_Of_State|  may be chosen from among the sovereigns spouse and the four individuals next in the line of succession who are over 21 years of age . Customarily the sovereign remains standing at meetings of the Privy Council, so that no other members may sit down, thereby keeping meetings short. The  |Lord_President|Lord_President_Of_The_Council|  reads out a list of Orders to be made, and the sovereign merely says Approved . Brazier, p. 199.     Few Privy Counsellors are required to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors, usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of  |Lord_President_of_the_Council|Lord_President_Of_The_Council| , currently  |Jacob_Rees_Mogg|Jacob_Rees_Mogg|  ,  invariably presides.  Under Britains modern conventions of  |parliamentary_government|Parliamentary_Government|  and  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy| , every order made in Council is drafted by a  |Government_Department|Civil_Service|  and has already been approved by the  |Minister|Minister|  responsible – thus actions taken by the  |Queen_in_Council|Queen_In_Council|  are formalities required for validation of each measure.     Full meetings of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces his or her own engagement ; or when there is a  |demise_of_the_Crown|Demise_Of_The_Crown| , either by the death or abdication of the  |monarch|Monarch| . A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when  |George_Prince_of_Wales|George_Iv_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  was sworn in as  |Prince_Regent|Prince_Regent|  by  |Act_of_Parliament|Regency_Acts| .  The  |current_statutes_regulating_the_establishment_of_a_regency|Regency_Acts|  in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any  |regents|Prince_Regent|  to swear their oaths before the Privy Council. Regency Act 1937, Sect. 2.2 and 4.1.     In the case of a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council – together with the  |Lords_Spiritual|Lords_Spiritual| , the  |Lords_Temporal|Lords_Temporal| , the  |Lord_Mayor|Lord_Mayor_Of_The_City_Of_London|  and  |Aldermen|Court_Of_Aldermen|  of the  |City_of_London|City_Of_London|  as well as representatives of  |Commonwealth_realms|Commonwealth_Realm|  – makes a proclamation declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the  |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland| , as required by law. It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an  |allocution|Allocution|  to the Privy Council on that occasion, and this Sovereigns Speech is formally published in The London Gazette . Any such Special Assembly of the Privy Council, convened to proclaim the accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarchs statutory oath, is known as an  |Accession_Council|Accession_Council| . The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952: as  |Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii|  was abroad when the last  |demise_of_the_Crown|Demise_Of_The_Crown|  took place, the Accession Council met twice, once to proclaim the sovereign , and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain, to receive from her the oath required by statute .  The Times , 7 February 1952, p. 6; The Times, 8 February 1952, p. 6.       The sovereign exercises executive authority by making  |Orders_in_Council|Order_In_Council|  upon the advice of the Privy Council. Orders-in-Council, which are drafted by the  |government|Her_Majestys_Government|  rather than by the sovereign, are secondary legislation and are used to make government regulations and to make government appointments. Furthermore, Orders-in-Council are used to grant  |Royal_Assent|Royal_Assent|  for  |Measures_of_the_National_Assembly_for_Wales|Measures_Of_The_National_Assembly_For_Wales| ,   dated 9 July 2008, approving The NHS Redress Measure 2008, the first Measure to be passed by the Assembly on 6 May 2008. Office of Public Sector Information. and  |laws|Law|  passed by the  |legislatures|Legislature|  of  |British|The_Crown| |_Crown_dependencies|Crown_Dependency| .      Distinct from Orders-in-Council are  |Orders_of_Council|Order_Of_Council| |Acts_of_Parliament|Act_Of_Parliament| , and most commonly are used for the regulation of  |public_institutions|Institute| .     The sovereign also grants  |Royal_Charters|Royal_Charter|  on the advice of the Privy Council. Charters bestow special status to  |incorporated_bodies|Incorporation| ; they are used to grant  |_chartered_|List_Of_British_Professional_Bodieschartered|  status to certain  |professional|Professional_Association| , educational or charitable bodies, and sometimes also  |city|City_Status_In_The_United_Kingdom|  and  |borough|Borough|  status to towns.  The Privy Council therefore deals with a wide range of matters, which also includes university and  |livery_company|Livery_Company|  statutes, Gay and Rees, p. 5.  |churchyards|Churchyard| , H.  Cox, p. 393. coinage and the dates of  |bank_holidays|Bank_Holiday| . The Privy Council formerly had sole power to grant academic degree-awarding powers and the title of university,  but following the  |Higher_Education_and_Research_Act_2017|Higher_Education_And_Research_Act_2017|  these powers have been given to the  |Office_for_Students|Office_For_Students|  for educational institutions in England.  |Higher_Education_and_Research_Act_2017|Higher_Education_And_Research_Act_2017|  .           The Privy Council comprises a number of Standing Committees:       |Baronetage_Committee|Standing_Council_Of_The_Baronetage| |_Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom| |_Committee_for_the_Affairs_of_Jersey_and_Guernsey|Politics_Of_Jersey| |_Committee_for_the_Purposes_of_the_Crown_Office_Act_1877|Letters_Patent| |_Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council|Judicial_Committee_Of_The_Privy_Council| |_Scottish_Universities_Committee|Ancient_Universities_Of_Scotland| |_Universities_Committee|Universities_In_The_United_Kingdom|      The Baronetage Committee was established by a 1910  |Order_in_Council|Order_In_Council| , during  |Edward_VIIs|Edward_Vii|  reign, to scrutinise all succession claims to be placed on the  |Roll_of_Baronets|Official_Roll_Of_The_Baronetage| .     The Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey recommends approval of  |Channel_Islands|Channel_Islands|  legislation.     The Committee for the purposes of the  |Crown_Office_Act_1877|Great_Seal_Of_The_Realm|  consists of the  |Lord_Chancellor|Lord_Chancellor|  and  |Lord_Privy_Seal|Lord_Privy_Seal|  as well as a  |Secretary_of_State|Secretary_Of_State| . The Committee, which last met in 1988, is concerned with the design and usage of  |wafer_seals|Seal| .     The Scottish Universities Committee considers proposed amendments to the statutes of Scotlands four ancient universities. The Universities Committee, which last met in 1995, considers  |petitions|Petition|  against statutes   made by Oxford and Cambridge Universities and their colleges.     The  |Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council|Judicial_Committee_Of_The_Privy_Council| , N.  Cox, Abolition or Retention of the Privy Council, Sect.  2. consists of senior judges who are Privy Counsellors. Gay and Rees, p. 6. The decision of the Committee is presented in the form of advice to the monarch, but in practice it is always followed by the sovereign , who formally approves the recommendation of the Judicial Committee. Maitland, p. 463.     Within the United Kingdom, the Judicial Committee hears appeals from  |ecclesiastical_courts|Ecclesiastical_Courts| , the  |Court_of_Admiralty|Admiralty_Court|  of the  |Cinque_Ports|Cinque_Ports| ,  |prize_courts|Prize_Court|  and the Disciplinary Committee of the  |Royal_College_of_Veterinary_Surgeons|Royal_College_Of_Veterinary_Surgeons| , appeals against schemes of the  |Church_Commissioners|Church_Commissioners|  and appeals under certain Acts of Parliament .  The Crown-in-Council was formerly the  |Supreme_Appeal_Court|Court_Of_Appeal|  for the entire  |British_Empire|British_Empire| , Iwi, p. 128. but a number of Commonwealth countries have now abolished the right to such appeals. N.  Cox, Abolition or Retention of the Privy Council, Sect.  11. The Judicial Committee continues to hear appeals from several Commonwealth countries, from  |British_Overseas_Territories|British_Overseas_Territories| ,  |Sovereign_Base_Areas|Sovereign_Base_Area|  and  |Crown_dependencies|Crown_Dependencies| . The Judicial Committee had direct jurisdiction in cases relating to the  |Scotland_Act_1998|Scotland_Act_1998| , the  |Government_of_Wales_Act_1998|Government_Of_Wales_Act_1998|  and the  |Northern_Ireland_Act_1998|Northern_Ireland_Act_1998| , but this was transferred to the new  |Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in 2009.     In addition to the Standing Committees,  ad hoc  Committees are notionally set up to consider and report on Petitions for  |Royal_Charters_of_Incorporation|Royal_Charter|  and to approve changes to the  |bye_laws|Bye_Law|  of  |bodies|Corporate_Body|  created by Royal Charter.     Committees of Privy Counsellors are occasionally established to examine specific issues. Such Committees are independent of the   Privy Council Office and therefore do not report directly to the Lord President of the Council. Examples of such Committees include:   the  |Butler_Committee|Butler_Review|  – operation of the intelligence services in the runup to military intervention in Iraq   the Chilcot Committee – for the  |Chilcot_Inquiry|Chilcot_Inquiry|  on the use of intercept materials   the  |Gibson_Committee|Peter_Gibson|  of enquiry set up in 2010 – to consider whether the  |UK_security_services|Uk_Security_Services|  were complicit in torture of detainees.         The  |Civil_Service|Civil_Service|  is formally governed by  |Privy_Council_Orders|List_Of_Privy_Council_Orders| , as an exercise of the  |Royal_prerogative|Royal_Prerogative| . One such order implemented HM Governments ban of  |GCHQ|Government_Communications_Headquarters|  staff from joining a Trade Union.   Another, the Civil Service Order in Council 1997, permitted the Prime Minister to grant up to three  |political_advisers|Special_Advisers_In_The_United_Kingdom|  management authority over some Civil Servants.      In the 1960s, the Privy Council made an order to evict the 2,000 inhabitants of the 65-island  |Chagos_Archipelago|Chagos_Archipelago|  in the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| , in preparation for the establishment of a joint United States–United Kingdom military base on the largest outlying island,  |Diego_Garcia|Diego_Garcia| , some  distant. In 2000 the  |Court_of_Appeal|Court_Of_Appeal_Of_England_And_Wales|  ruled the  |1971_Immigration_Ordinance|Immigration_Act_1971|  preventing resettlement unlawful. In 2004, the Privy Council, under  |Jack_Straws|Jack_Straw|  tenure, overturned the ruling. In 2006 the  |High_Court_of_Justice|High_Court_Of_Justice|  found the Privy Councils decision to be unlawful.  |Sir_Sydney_Kentridge|Sydney_Kentridge|  described the treatment of the  |Chagossians|Chagossians|  as outrageous, unlawful and a breach of accepted moral standards : Justice Kentridge stated that there was no known  |precedent|Precedent|  for the lawful use of prerogative powers to remove or exclude an entire population of British subjects from their homes and place of birth ,    |BBC_Radio_4|Bbc_Radio_4| —, 12 May 2009           |BBC|Bbc| —, 11 May 2006   and the Court of Appeal were persuaded by this argument, but the  |Law_Lords|Law_Lords|   found its decision to be flawed and overturned the ruling by a 3–2 decision thereby upholding the terms of the Ordinance.          The Privy Council as a whole is termed  |The_Most_Honourable|The_Most_Honourable|  whilst its members individually, the Privy Counsellors, are entitled to be  |styled|Style| |_The_Right_Honourable|The_Right_Honourable|  .      Each Privy Counsellor has the right of personal access to the sovereign. Peers were considered to enjoy this right individually; members of the House of Commons possess the right collectively. In each case, personal access may only be used to tender advice on  |public_affairs|Public_Policy| . N.  Cox, Peerage Privileges, pp. 25–6.     Only Privy Counsellors can signify royal consent to the examination of a  |Bill|Bill|  affecting the rights of the Crown. Hayter, Sect.  7.177.     Members of the Privy Council are privileged to be given advance notice of any  |prime_ministerial|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  decision to commit  |HM_Armed_Forces|Hm_Armed_Forces|  in  |enemy_action|Military_Operation| .      Privy Counsellors have the right to sit on the steps of the Sovereigns Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a privilege which was shared with  |heirs_apparent|Heirs_Apparent|  of those  |hereditary_peers|Hereditary_Peerage|  who were to become members of the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords|  before Labours partial  |Reform_of_the_Lords|House_Of_Lords_Act_1999|  in 1999, diocesan bishops of the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England|  yet to be  |Lords_Spiritual|Lords_Spiritual| , retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the  |Dean_of_Westminster|Dean_Of_Westminster| ,  |Peers_of_Ireland|Peerage_Of_Ireland| , the  |Clerk_of_the_Crown_in_Chancery|Clerk_Of_The_Crown_In_Chancery| , and the  |Gentleman_Usher_of_the_Black_Rod|Black_Rod| . Hayter, Sect.  1.37. While Privy Counsellors have the right to sit on the steps of the Sovereigns Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| ,  |Theresa_May|Theresa_May| , and  |David_Lidington|David_Lidington| , who watched the opening of the debate of the  |European_Union_Bill_2017|European_Union_Bill_2017|  in the House of Lords.      Privy Counsellors are accorded a formal rank of  |precedence|Order_Of_Precedence_In_England_And_Wales| , if not already having a higher one. Blackstone, I. 318. At the beginning of each new Parliament, and at the discretion of the  |Speaker|Speaker_Of_The_House_Of_Commons| , those members of the House of Commons who are Privy Counsellors usually take the oath of allegiance before all other members except the Speaker and the  |Father_of_the_House|Father_Of_The_House|  .  Should a Privy Counsellor rise to speak in the House of Commons at the same time as another  |Honourable_Member|Member_Of_Parliament| , the Speaker usually gives priority to the Right Honourable Member.  This parliamentary custom, however, was discouraged under  |New_Labour|New_Labour|  after 1998, despite the Government not being supposed to exert influence over the Speaker.      All those sworn of the Privy Council are accorded the style The Right Honourable , but some nobles automatically have higher styles:  |non_royal_dukes|Duke|  are styled  |The_Most_Noble|The_Most_Noble|  and marquesses,  |The_Most_Honourable|The_Most_Honourable|  . Modern custom as recommended by  Debretts  is to use the post-nominal letters PC in a social style of address for  |peers|Peerage|  who are Privy Counsellors. For  |commoners|Commoner| , The Right Honourable is sufficient identification of their status as a Privy Counsellor and they do not use the post-nominal letters PC .   The  |Ministry_of_Justice|Ministry_Of_Justice|  revises current practice of this convention from time to time.        The Privy Council is one of the four principal councils of the sovereign. The other three are the courts of law, the  Commune Concilium  and the  Magnum Concilium  . All are still in existence, or at least have never been formally abolished, but the Magnum Concilium has not been summoned since 1640 and was considered defunct even then. Blackstone, I. Chapter 5.     Several other Privy Councils have advised the sovereign. England and Scotland once had separate Privy Councils . The  |Acts_of_Union_1707|Acts_Of_Union_1707|  united the two countries into the  |Kingdom_of_Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain|  and in 1708 the  |Parliament_of_Great_Britain|Parliament_Of_Great_Britain|  abolished the Privy Council of Scotland.   Thereafter there was one Privy Council of Great Britain sitting in London.   |Ireland|Kingdom_Of_Ireland| , on the other hand, continued to have a separate Privy Council even after the  |Act_of_Union_1800|Act_Of_Union_1800| . The  |Privy_Council_of_Ireland|Privy_Council_Of_Ireland|  was abolished in 1922, when  |the_southern_part_of_Ireland|Southern_Ireland|  separated from the United Kingdom; it was succeeded by the  |Privy_Council_of_Northern_Ireland|Privy_Council_Of_Northern_Ireland| , which became dormant after the suspension of the  |Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland|Parliament_Of_Northern_Ireland|  in 1972. No further appointments have been made since then, and only three appointees were still living as of November 2017.       |Canada|Canada|  has had its own Privy Council—the  |Queens_Privy_Council_for_Canada|Queens_Privy_Council_For_Canada| —since 1867.  While the Canadian Privy Council is specifically for Canada , the Privy Council discussed above is not for the United Kingdom ; in order to clarify the ambiguity where necessary, the latter was traditionally referred to as the Imperial Privy Council. Equivalent organs of state in other Commonwealth realms, such as Australia and New Zealand, are called  |Executive_Councils|Executive_Council| .
