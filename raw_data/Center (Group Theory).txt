   In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , the center of a  |group|Group| , , is the  |set|Set|  of elements that  |commute|Commutative|  with every element of . It is denoted , from German  Zentrum , meaning center. In  |set_builder_notation|Set_Builder_Notation| ,     :.     The center is a  |normal_subgroup|Normal_Subgroup| , . As a subgroup, it is always  |characteristic|Characteristic_Subgroup| , but is not necessarily  |fully_characteristic|Fully_Characteristic_Subgroup| . The  |quotient_group|Quotient_Group| , , is  |isomorphic|Group_Isomorphism|  to the  |inner_automorphism|Inner_Automorphism|  group, .     A group  is abelian if and only if . At the other extreme, a group is said to be centerless if  is  |trivial|Trivial_Group| ; i.e., consists only of the  |identity_element|Identity_Element| .     The elements of the center are sometimes called central.       The center of G is always a  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of . In particular:    contains the  |identity_element|Identity_Element|  of , because it commutes with every element of , by definition: , where  is the identity;   If  and  are in , then so is , by associativity:  for each ; i.e.,  is closed;   If  is in , then so is  as, for all  in ,  commutes with .     Furthermore, the center of  is always a  |normal_subgroup|Normal_Subgroup|  of . Since all elements of  commute, it is closed under  |conjugation|Conjugate_Closure| .       By definition, the center is the set of elements for which the  |conjugacy_class|Conjugacy_Class|  of each element is the element itself; i.e., .     The center is also the  |intersection|Intersection|  of all the  |centralizers|Centralizer_And_Normalizer|  of each element of . As centralizers are subgroups, this again shows that the center is a subgroup.       Consider the map, , from  to the  |automorphism_group|Automorphism_Group|  of  defined by , where  is the automorphism of  defined by   :.     The function,  is a  |group_homomorphism|Group_Homomorphism| , and its  |kernel|Kernel|  is precisely the center of , and its image is called the  |inner_automorphism_group|Inner_Automorphism_Group|  of , denoted . By the  |first_isomorphism_theorem|First_Isomorphism_Theorem|  we get,   :.     The  |cokernel|Cokernel|  of this map is the group  of  |outer_automorphisms|Outer_Automorphism| , and these form the  |exact_sequence|Exact_Sequence|    :.       second center, third center, etc.equivalently,  .
