The Adamic language is, according to  |Jewish|Jews|  tradition  and some  |Christians|Christians| , the language spoken by  |Adam|Adam|   in the  |Garden_of_Eden|Garden_Of_Eden| . It is variously interpreted as either the language used by  |God|God|  to address Adam , or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things , as in the  |second_Genesis_creation_myth|Genesis_Creation_Narrative|  .     In the Middle Ages, various Jewish commentators held that Adam spoke Hebrew, a view also addressed in various ways by the late medieval Italian poet  |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri| . In the early modern period, some authors continued to discuss the possibility of an Adamic language, some continuing to hold to the idea that it was Hebrew, while others such as John Locke were more skeptical. More recently, a variety of Mormon authors have expressed various opinions about the nature of the Adamic language.            Traditional Jewish exegesis such as  |Midrash|Midrash|   says that Adam spoke the  |Hebrew_language|Hebrew_Language|  because the names he gives Eve – Isha  and Chava – only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast,  |Kabbalism|Kabbalism|  assumed an eternal Torah which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus,  |Abraham_Abulafia|Abraham_Abulafia|  in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in  |Paradise|Paradise|  had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then-current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew. Umberto Eco, The Search for the Perfect Language , p. 32 f.      |Umberto_Eco|Umberto_Eco|  notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adams descendants until the  |confusion_of_tongues|Confusion_Of_Tongues|  , or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel . Umberto Eco, The Search for the Perfect Language , 7–10.      |Dante_Alighieri|Dante_Alighieri|  addresses the topic in his  De vulgari eloquentia  . He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable. Mazzocco, p. 159 He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing  |the_serpent|Serpents_In_The_Bible| , and not to Adam. mulierem invenitur ante omnes fuisse locutam. Umberto Eco, The Search for the Perfect Language , p. 50.     In his  Divine Comedy  , however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam. Mazzocco, p. 170 This had the consequence that it could no longer be regarded as immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes  that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition,  El , must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as  I . Paradiso 26.133f.; Mazzocco, p. 178f.            Elizabethan scholar  |John_Dee|John_Dee|  makes references to an  |occult|Occult|  or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of  |spirit_medium|Spirit_Medium| |Edward_Kelley|Edward_Kelley| . Dees journals did not describe the language as  |Enochian|Enochian|  , instead preferring Angelical , the Celestial Speech , the Language of Angels , the First Language of God-Christ , the Holy Language , or Adamical because, according to Dees Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dees assertion that the  |Biblical_Patriarch|Biblical_Patriarch| |Enoch|Enoch|  had been the last human to know the language.     Dutch physician, linguist, and humanist  |Johannes_Goropius_Becanus|Johannes_Goropius_Becanus|  theorized in Origines Antwerpianae that  |Antwerp|Antwerp| ian  |Brabantic|Brabantic| , spoken in the region between the  |Scheldt|Scheldt|  and  |Meuse|Meuse|  Rivers, was the original language spoken in Paradise. Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words. Since Brabantic has a higher number of short words than do Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, Goropius reasoned that it was the older language.  His work influenced that of  |Simon_Stevin|Simon_Stevin|  , who espoused similar ideas in Uytspraeck van de weerdicheyt der Duytse tael , a chapter in  De Beghinselen Der Weeghconst  .       By the 17th century, the existence and nature of the alleged Adamic language was commonly discussed amongst European Jewish and Christian mystics and primitive linguists.   |Robert_Boyle|Robert_Boyle|  was skeptical that Hebrew was the language best capable of describing the nature of things, stating:   I could never find, that the Hebrew names of animals, mentioned in the beginning of Genesis, argued a clearer insight into their natures, than did the names of the same or some other animals in Greek, or other languages .      |John_Locke|John_Locke|  expressed similar skepticism in his  An Essay Concerning Human Understanding  .            |Joseph_Smith|Joseph_Smith| , founder of the  |Latter_Day_Saint_movement|Latter_Day_Saint_Movement| , in his  |revision_of_the_Bible|Joseph_Smith_Translation_Of_The_Bible| , declared the Adamic language to have been pure and undefiled .  |Book_of_Moses|Book_Of_Moses|  . Some  |Latter_Day_Saints|Latter_Day_Saints|  believe it to be the language of  |God|God| .   |Glossolalia|Glossolalia| , or speaking in tongues, was commonplace in the early years of the movement, and it was commonly believed that the incomprehensible language spoken during these incidents was the language of Adam. However, this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted. Copeland, Lee. Speaking in Tongues in the Restoration Churches , Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol 24, No. 1     Some other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including  |Brigham_Young|Brigham_Young| , Brigham Young,  ,  Millennial Star , vol. 25, no. 28, p. 439 , cited in  History of the Church  1 |Orson_Pratt|Orson_Pratt| ,  Journal of Discourses    . and  |Elizabeth_Ann_Whitney|Elizabeth_Ann_Whitney| ,  Womans Exponent    . claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by  |revelation|Revelation| . Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the pure language spoken of by  |Zephaniah|Zephaniah| |Zephaniah|Book_Of_Zephaniah|   and that it will be restored as the  |universal_language|Universal_Language|  of humankind at the end of the world.  |Oliver_Cowdery|Oliver_Cowdery| , ,  Evening and Morning Star , vol. 2, no. 18, p. 142 .  |Bruce_R._McConkie|Bruce_R._Mcconkie|  .

An 1832 handwritten page from the  |Joseph_Smith_Papers|Joseph_Smith_Papers| , titled A Sample of the Pure Language , and reportedly dictated by Smith to Br.

Some believe that the Pay Lay Ale sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase pe le-El , mouth to God . Pay Lay Ale was identified in the temple ceremony as words from the pure Adamic language .
