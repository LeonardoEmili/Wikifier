              An armored fighting vehicle  is an armed  |combat_vehicle|Combat_Vehicle|  protected by  |armour|Vehicle_Armour| , generally combining  |operational_mobility|Operational_Mobility|  with  |offensive|Offensive|  and  |defensive|Defense|  capabilities. AFVs can be wheeled or  |tracked|Continuous_Track| .  |Main_battle_tanks|Main_Battle_Tank| ,  |armoured_cars|Armored_Car| , armoured  |self-propelled_guns|Self-Propelled_Gun| , and  |armoured_personnel_carriers|Armoured_Personnel_Carrier|  are all examples of AFVs.     Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. The classifications are not absolute; two countries may classify the same vehicle differently, and the criteria change over time. For example, relatively lightly armed  |armoured_personnel_carriers|Armoured_Personnel_Carrier|  were largely superseded by  |infantry_fighting_vehicles|Infantry_Fighting_Vehicle|  with much heavier armament in a similar role.     Successful designs are often adapted to a wide variety of applications. For example, the  |MOWAG_Piranha|Mowag_Piranha| , originally designed as an  |APC|Armored_Personnel_Carrier| , has been adapted to fill numerous roles such as a  |mortar_carrier|Mortar_Carrier| ,  |infantry_fighting_vehicle|Infantry_Fighting_Vehicle| , and  |assault_gun|Assault_Gun| .                 The concept of a highly mobile and protected fighting unit has been around for centuries; from  |Hannibals|Hannibal|  war elephants to  |Leonardos|Leonardo_Da_Vinci|  contraptions, military strategists endeavoured to maximize the mobility and survivability of their soldiers.     Armoured fighting vehicles were not possible until  |internal_combustion_engines|Internal_Combustion_Engine|  of sufficient power became available at the start of the  |20th_century|20Th_Century| .             Modern armoured fighting vehicles represent the realization of an ancient concept - that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower. Armies have deployed war machines and cavalries with rudimentary armour in battle for millennia. Use of these animals and engineering designs sought to achieve a balance between the conflicting  |paradox|Paradox| ical needs of mobility, firepower and protection.           |Siege_engines|Siege_Engine| , such as  |battering_rams|Battering_Ram|  and  |siege_towers|Siege_Tower| , would often be armoured in order to protect their crews from enemy action.  |Polyidus_of_Thessaly|Polyidus_Of_Thessaly|  developed a very large movable siege tower, the  helepolis , as early as 340 BC, and Greek forces used such structures in the  |Siege_of_Rhodes|Siege_Of_Rhodes|  .     The idea of a protected fighting vehicle has been known since antiquity. Frequently cited is  |Leonardo_da_Vincis|Leonardo_Da_Vinci|  15th-century sketch of a  |mobile,_protected_gun-platform|Leonardo_Da_Vincis_Fighting_Vehicle| ; the drawings show a conical, wooden shelter with apertures for cannons around the circumference. The machine was to be mounted on four wheels which would be turned by the crew through a system of  |hand_cranks|Hand_Crankhand-Powered_Cranks|  and  |cage_gears|Gearcage_Gear| . Leonardo claimed: I will build armored wagons which will be safe and invulnerable to enemy attacks. There will be no obstacle which it cannot overcome.  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name DCMB / ref name DCMB  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref name T27  /ref ref  /ref  ref name Brasseys  /ref  ref name Brasseys /  ref name morale effect  /ref ref name McNab Gulf War  /ref  |--Bhishma?-|--Bhishma?-|  ref  /ref  ref .
