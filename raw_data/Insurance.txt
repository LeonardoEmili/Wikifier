           Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of  |risk_management|Risk_Management| , primarily used to  |hedge|Hedge|  against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.     An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or  |underwriter|Underwriter| . A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurers promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an  |insurable_interest|Insurable_Interest|  established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.     The insured receives a  |contract|Contract| , called the  |insurance_policy|Insurance_Policy| , which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a  |claims_adjuster|Claims_Adjuster| . The insurer may  |hedge|Hedge|  its own risk by taking out  |reinsurance|Reinsurance| , whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.                 Methods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced by  |Chinese|China|  and  |Babylonia|Babylonia| n traders as long ago as the  |3rd|3Rd_Millennium_Bc|  and  |2nd|2Nd_Millennium_Bc| |millennia|Millennium|  BC, respectively. See, e.g., Vaughan, E. J., 1997, Risk Management, New York: Wiley. Chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessels capsizing. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous  |Code_of_Hammurabi|Code_Of_Hammurabi| , c. 1750 BC, and practiced by early  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean_Sea|  sailing  |merchants|Merchant| . If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lenders guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen, or lost at sea.     Circa 800 BC, the inhabitants of  |Rhodes|Rhodes|  created the  |general_average|General_Average| . This allowed groups of merchants to pay to insure their goods being shipped together. The collected premiums would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during transport, whether due to storm or sinkage.      Separate insurance contracts were invented in  |Genoa|Genoa|  in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from  |Genoa|Genoa|  in 1347, and in the next century maritime insurance developed widely and premiums were intuitively varied with risks. J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal , 274-277. These new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful in  |marine_insurance|Marine_Insurance| .       Insurance became far more sophisticated in  |Enlightenment_era|Enlightenment_Era| |Europe|Europe| , and specialized varieties developed.         |Property_insurance|Property_Insurance|  as we know it today can be traced to the  |Great_Fire_of_London|Great_Fire_Of_London| , which in 1666 devoured more than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in Sir  |Christopher_Wrens|Christopher_Wren|  inclusion of a site for the Insurance Office in his new plan for London in 1667. Dickson : 4 A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681,  |economist|Economics| |Nicholas_Barbon|Nicholas_Barbon|  and eleven associates established the first fire insurance company, the Insurance Office for Houses , at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes. Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by his Insurance Office. Dickson : 7     At the same time, the first insurance schemes for the  |underwriting|Underwriting|  of  |business_ventures|Business_Venture|  became available. By the end of the seventeenth century, Londons growing importance as a center for trade was increasing demand for  |marine_insurance|Marine_Insurance| . In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd opened  |a_coffee_house|Lloyds_Coffee_House| , which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance market  |Lloyds_of_London|Lloyds_Of_London|  and several related shipping and insurance businesses.         The first  |life_insurance|Life_Insurance|  policies were taken out in the early 18th century. The first company to offer life insurance was the  |Amicable_Society_for_a_Perpetual_Assurance_Office|Amicable_Society_For_A_Perpetual_Assurance_Office| , founded in London in 1706 by  |William_Talbot|William_Talbot|  and  |Sir_Thomas_Allen|Allen_Baronets| . Anzovin, Steven, Famous First Facts 2000, item 2422, H. W. Wilson Company,  p. 121 The first life insurance company known of record was founded in 1706 by the Bishop of Oxford and the financier Thomas Allen in London, England. The company, called the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, collected annual premiums from policyholders and paid the nominees of deceased members from a common fund. Amicable Society, The charters, acts of Parliament, and by-laws of the corporation of the Amicable Society for a perpetual assurance office, Gilbert and Rivington, 1854, p. 4  |Edward_Rowe_Mores|Edward_Rowe_Mores|  established the  |Society_for_Equitable_Assurances_on_Lives_and_Survivorship|The_Equitable_Life_Assurance_Society|  in 1762.     It was the worlds first  |mutual_insurer|Mutual_Insurer|  and it pioneered age based premiums based on  |mortality_rate|Mortality_Rate|  laying the framework for scientific insurance practice and development and the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently based.      In the late 19th century accident insurance began to become available.  The first company to offer accident insurance was the Railway Passengers Assurance Company, formed in 1848 in England to insure against the rising number of fatalities on the nascent  |railway|Railway|  system.     By the late 19th century governments began to initiate national insurance programs against sickness and old age.  |Germany|History_Of_Germany|  built on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s Chancellor  |Otto_von_Bismarck|Otto_Von_Bismarck|  introduced old age pensions, accident insurance and medical care that formed the basis for Germanys  |welfare_state|Welfare_State| . E. P. Hennock, The Origin of the Welfare State in England and Germany, 1850–1914: Social Policies Compared Hermann Beck, Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia, 1815-1870 In Britain more extensive legislation was introduced by the  |Liberal|Liberal_Party|  government in the  |1911_National_Insurance_Act|1911_National_Insurance_Act| . This gave the British working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment.  The National Archives, 2013. Retrieved 30 June 2013. This system was greatly expanded after the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  under the influence of the  |Beveridge_Report|Beveridge_Report| , to form the first modern  |welfare_state|Welfare_State| . Bentley B. Gilbert, British social policy, 1914-1939       Insurance involves  |pooling|Pooling|  funds from many insured entities to pay for the losses that some may incur. The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an  |insurable_risk|Insurable_Risk| , the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a  |financial_intermediary|Financial_Intermediary|  is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry, but individual entities can also  |self-insure|Self-Insurance|  through saving money for possible future losses. Gollier C. . . The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory.            Risk which can be insured by private companies typically shares seven common characteristics: This discussion is adapted from Mehr and Camack Principles of Insurance , 6th edition, 1976, pp 34 – 37.     Large number of similar exposure units |law_of_large_numbers|Law_Of_Large_Numbers|  in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include  |Lloyds_of_London|Lloyds_Of_London| , which is famous for ensuring the life or health of actors, sports figures, and other famous individuals. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different premium rates.   Definite loss |Fire|Fire| ,  |automobile_accidents|Traffic_Collision| , and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory.  |Occupational_disease|Occupational_Disease| , for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.   Accidental lossLarge lossAffordable premium.   Calculable lossLimited risk of catastrophically large losses |independent|Independence|  and non-catastrophic, meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base.  |Capital|Capital|  constrains insurers ability to sell  |earthquake_insurance|Earthquake_Insurance|  as well as wind insurance in  |hurricane|Tropical_Cyclone|  zones. In the United States,  |flood_risk|Flood_Insurance|  is insured by the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurers capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the  |reinsurance|Reinsurance|  market.       When a company insures an individual entity, there are basic legal requirements and regulations. Several commonly cited legal principles of insurance include: Irish Brokers Association.  .    |Indemnity|Indemnity|  – the insurance company indemnifies, or compensates, the insured in the case of certain losses only up to the insureds interest.   Benefit insurance – as it is stated in the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, the insurance company does not have the right of recovery from the party who caused the injury and is to compensate the Insured regardless of the fact that Insured had already sued the negligent party for the damages    |Insurable_interest|Insurable_Interest|  – the insured typically must directly suffer from the loss. Insurable interest must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved. The concept requires that the insured have a stake in the loss or damage to the life or property insured. What that stake is will be determined by the kind of insurance involved and the nature of the property ownership or relationship between the persons. The requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes insurance from  |gambling|Gambling| .    |Utmost_good_faith|Good_Faith|  –  the insured and the insurer are bound by a  |good_faith|Good_Faith|  bond of honesty and fairness. Material facts must be disclosed.   Contribution – insurers which have similar obligations to the insured contribute in the indemnification, according to some method.   Subrogation – the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue recoveries on behalf of the insured; for example, the insurer may sue those liable for the insureds loss. The Insurers can waive their subrogation rights by using the special clauses.   Causa proxima, or  |proximate_cause|Proximate_Cause|  – the cause of loss must be covered under the insuring agreement of the policy, and the dominant cause must not be  |excluded|Exclusion_Clause|    Mitigation – In case of any loss or casualty, the asset owner must attempt to keep loss to a minimum, as if the asset was not insured.          To indemnify means to make whole again, or to be reinstated to the position that one was in, to the extent possible, prior to the happening of a specified event or peril. Accordingly,  |life_insurance|Life_Insurance|  is generally not considered to be indemnity insurance, but rather contingent insurance . There are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured:   A reimbursement policy   A pay on behalf or on behalf of policy C. Kulp & J. Hall, Casualty Insurance, Fourth Edition, 1968, page 35   An indemnification policy     From an insureds standpoint, the result is usually the same: the insurer pays the loss and claims expenses.     If the Insured has a reimbursement policy, the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be reimbursed by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including, with the permission of the insurer, claim expenses. However, bankruptcy of the insured with a reimbursement policy does not relieve the insurer. Certain types of insurance, e.g., workers compensation and personal automobile liability, are subject to statutory requirements that injured parties have direct access to coverage.     Under a pay on behalf policy, the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything. Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of pay on behalf language which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim.     Under an indemnification policy, the insurance carrier can generally either reimburse or pay on behalf of , whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling process.     An entity seeking to transfer risk becomes the insured party once risk is assumed by an insurer, the insuring party, by means of a  |contract|Contract| , called an  |insurance_policy|Insurance_Policy| . Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: identification of participating parties , the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage , and  |exclusions|Exclusion_Clause|  . An insured is thus said to be  |indemnified|Indemnity|  against the loss covered in the policy.     When insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims – in theory for a relatively few claimants – and for  |overhead|Overhead|  costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses , the remaining margin is an insurers  |profit|Profit| .       Policies typically include a number of exclusions, including typically:    |Nuclear_exclusion_clause|Nuclear_Exclusion_Clause| , excluding damage caused by nuclear and radiation accidents    |War_exclusion_clause|War_Exclusion_Clause| , excluding damage from acts of war or terrorism         Insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.     Insurance can influence the probability of losses through  |moral_hazard|Moral_Hazard| ,  |insurance_fraud|Insurance_Fraud| , and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically used  |moral_hazard|Moral_Hazard|  to refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference.  Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures—particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes—because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation, such as through  |building_codes|Building_Code| . Kunreuther H. . . Journal of Risk and Uncertainty.       According to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows:   Co-insurance – risks shared between insurers   Dual insurance – having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk   Self-insurance – situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselves   Reinsurance – situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer, called the reinsurer              The business model is to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses, and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept. Profit can be reduced to a simple equation:   :Profit  |earned_premium|Cancellation|  + investment income – incurred loss – underwriting expenses.     Insurers make money in two ways:   Through  |underwriting|Underwriting| , the process by which insurers select the risks to insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those risks   By  |investing|Investment|  the premiums they collect from insured parties     The most complicated aspect of the insurance business is the  |actuarial_science|Actuarial_Science|  of ratemaking of policies, which uses  |statistics|Statistics|  and  |probability|Probability|  to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk. After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process.     At the most basic level, initial ratemaking involves looking at the  |frequency|Frequency|  and  |severity|Wikt:Severity|  of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils. Thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss data, bring the loss data to  |present_value|Present_Value| , and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy. Brown RL. . . ACTEX Publications.  |Loss_ratios|Loss_Ratio|  and expense loads are also used. Rating for different risk characteristics involves at the most basic level comparing the losses with loss relativities —a policy with twice as many losses would therefore be charged twice as much. More complex  |multivariate_analyses|Multivariate_Analysis|  are sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results. Other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses.     Upon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurers  |underwriting_profit|Underwriting_Profit|  on that policy. Underwriting performance is measured by something called the combined ratio , which is the ratio of expenses/losses to premiums.  A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. A company with a combined ratio over 100% may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings.     Insurance companies earn  |investment|Investment|  profits on float . Float, or available reserve, is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims. Insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them until claims are paid out. The  |Association_of_British_Insurers|Association_Of_British_Insurers|  has almost 20% of the investments in the  |London_Stock_Exchange|London_Stock_Exchange| .  . Abi.org.uk. Retrieved on 18 July 2013. In 2007, U.S. industry profits from float totaled $58 billion. In a 2009 letter to investors, Warren Buffett wrote, we were paid $2.8 billion to hold our float in 2008.      In the  |United_States|United_States| , the underwriting loss of  |property|Property_Insurance|  and  |casualty_insurance|Casualty_Insurance|  companies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance industry insiders, most notably  |Hank_Greenberg|Maurice_R._Greenberg| , do not believe that it is forever possible to sustain a profit from float without an underwriting profit as well, but this opinion is not universally held. Reliance on float for profit has led some industry experts to call insurance companies investment companies that raise the money for their investments by selling insurance.      Naturally, the float method is difficult to carry out in an  |economically_depressed|Depression|  period.  |Bear_markets|Bear_Market|  do cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards, so a poor economy generally means high insurance premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known as the  |underwriting,_or_insurance,_cycle|Insurance_Cycle| . Fitzpatrick, Sean,  10 Conn. Ins. L.J. 255 .       Claims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the actual product paid for. Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or through  |brokers_or_agents|Insurance_Broker| . The insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry form, such as those produced by  |ACORD|Acord| .     Insurance company claims departments employ a large number of  |claims_adjusters|Claims_Adjuster|  supported by a staff of  |records_management|Records_Management|  and  |data_entry_clerks|Data_Entry_Clerk| . Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience. The adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract, and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim, and authorizes payment.     The policyholder may hire their own  |public_adjuster|Public_Adjuster|  to negotiate the settlement with the insurance company on their behalf. For policies that are complicated, where claims may be complex, the insured may take out a separate insurance policy add-on, called loss recovery insurance, which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claim.     Adjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is a third party involved, the  |plaintiff|Plaintiff| , who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as a  |deep_pocket|Deep_Pocket| . The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured , monitor litigation that may take years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judge.     If a claims adjuster suspects under-insurance, the  |condition_of_average|Condition_Of_Average|  may come into play to limit the insurance companys exposure.     In managing the claims handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims overpayment leakages. As part of this balancing act,  |fraudulent_insurance_practices|Insurance_Fraud|  are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome. Disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation .       Insurers will often use  |insurance_agents|Agency|  to initially market or underwrite their customers. Agents can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, meaning that they can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to improved and personalized service. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities to market their products.         Any risk that can be quantified can potentially be insured. Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that exist. A single policy that may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below. For example,  |vehicle_insurance|Vehicle_Insurance|  would typically cover both the property risk and the liability risk . A  |home_insurance|Home_Insurance|  policy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owners belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owners property.      |Business|Business|  insurance can take a number of different forms, such as the various kinds of professional liability insurance, also called professional indemnity , which are discussed below under that name; and the  |business_owners_policy|Business_Owners_Policy|  , which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners insurance packages the coverages that a homeowner needs.              Auto insurance protects the policyholder against financial loss in the event of an incident involving a vehicle they own, such as in a  |traffic_collision|Traffic_Collision| .     Coverage typically includes:   Property coverage, for damage to or theft of the car   Liability coverage, for the legal responsibility to others for bodily injury or property damage   Medical coverage, for the cost of treating injuries, rehabilitation and sometimes lost wages and funeral expenses            Gap insurance covers the excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where your insurance company does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the companys specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put low  |down_payments|Down_Payment| , have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.               Health insurance policies cover the cost of medical treatments. Dental insurance, like medical insurance, protects policyholders for dental costs. In most developed countries, all citizens receive some health coverage from their governments, paid through taxation. In most countries, health insurance is often part of an employers benefits.         |Disability_insurance|Disability_Insurance|  policies provide financial support in the event of the policyholder becoming unable to work because of disabling illness or injury. It provides monthly support to help pay such obligations as  |mortgage_loans|Mortgage_Loan|  and  |credit_cards|Credit_Card| . Short-term and long-term disability policies are available to individuals, but considering the expense, long-term policies are generally obtained only by those with at least six-figure incomes, such as doctors, lawyers, etc. Short-term disability insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months, paying a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities.   Long-term disability insurance covers an individuals expenses for the long term, up until such time as they are considered permanently disabled and thereafter Insurance companies will often try to encourage the person back into employment in preference to and before declaring them unable to work at all and therefore totally disabled.    |Disability_overhead_insurance|Business_Overhead_Expense_Disability_Insurance|  allows business owners to cover the overhead expenses of their business while they are unable to work.    |Total_permanent_disability_insurance|Total_Permanent_Disability_Insurance|  provides benefits when a person is permanently disabled and can no longer work in their profession, often taken as an adjunct to life insurance.    |Workers_compensation|Workers_Compensation|  insurance replaces all or part of a workers  |wages|Wage|  lost and accompanying medical expenses incurred because of a job-related injury.          Casualty insurance insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property. It is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified, such as auto, workers compensation, and some liability insurances.   Crime insurance is a form of casualty insurance that covers the policyholder against losses arising from the  |criminal_acts|Criminal_Act|  of third parties. For example, a company can obtain crime insurance to cover losses arising from  |theft|Theft|  or  |embezzlement|Embezzlement| .    |Terrorism_insurance|Terrorism_Insurance|  provides protection against any loss or damage caused by  |terrorist|Terrorism|  activities. In the United States in the wake of  |9/11|September_11_Attacks| , the  |Terrorism_Risk_Insurance_Act|Terrorism_Risk_Insurance_Act|  2002 set up a federal program providing a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program was extended until the end of 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act 2007 .    |Kidnap_and_ransom_insurance|Kidnap_And_Ransom_Insurance|  is designed to protect individuals and corporations operating in high-risk areas around the world against the perils of kidnap, extortion, wrongful detention and hijacking.    |Political_risk_insurance|Political_Risk_Insurance|  is a form of casualty insurance that can be taken out by businesses with operations in countries in which there is a risk that  |revolution|Revolution|  or other  |political|Politics|  conditions could result in a loss.             Life insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedents family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured persons family, burial, funeral and other final expenses. Life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or an  |annuity|Annuity| . In most states, a person cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge.     Annuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and  |pensions|Pension|  that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a  |retiree|Retirement|  will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.     Certain life insurance contracts accumulate  |cash|Cash|  values, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities and  |endowment_policies|Endowment_Policy| , are financial instruments to accumulate or  |liquidate|Liquidation| |wealth|Wealth|  when it is needed.     In many countries, such as the United States and the UK, the  |tax_law|Tax_Law|  provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method of  |saving|Saving|  as well as protection in the event of early death.     In the United States, the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived from  |tax_deferral|Tax_Deferral|  may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables . Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles may be better alternatives for value accumulation.       Burial insurance is a very old type of life insurance which is paid out upon death to cover final expenses, such as the cost of a  |funeral|Funeral| . The  |Greeks|Ancient_Greece|  and  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  introduced burial insurance c.  600 CE when they organized  |guilds|Guild|  called benevolent societies which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  served a similar purpose, as did friendly societies during Victorian times.             Property insurance provides protection against risks to property, such as  |fire|Fire| ,  |theft|Theft|  or  |weather|Weather|  damage. This may include specialized forms of insurance such as fire insurance,  |flood_insurance|Flood_Insurance| ,  |earthquake_insurance|Earthquake_Insurance| ,  |home_insurance|Home_Insurance| , inland marine insurance or  |boiler_insurance|Boiler_Insurance| .   The term property insurance may, like casualty insurance, be used as a broad category of various subtypes of insurance, some of which are listed below:       |Aviation_insurance|Aviation_Insurance|  protects  |aircraft|Aircraft|  hulls and spares, and associated liability risks, such as passenger and third-party liability.  |Airports|Airport|  may also appear under this subcategory, including air traffic control and refuelling operations for international airports through to smaller domestic exposures.    |Boiler_insurance|Boiler_Insurance|  insures against accidental physical damage to boilers, equipment or machinery.    |Builders_risk_insurance|Builders_Risk_Insurance|  insures against the risk of physical loss or damage to property during construction. Builders risk insurance is typically written on an all risk basis covering damage arising from any cause not otherwise expressly excluded. Builders risk insurance is coverage that protects a persons or organizations insurable interest in materials, fixtures or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an insured peril.     |Crop_insurance|Crop_Insurance|  may be purchased by farmers to reduce or manage various risks associated with growing crops. Such risks include crop loss or damage caused by weather, hail, drought, frost damage, insects, or disease.  Method for providing crop insurance for a crop associated with a defined attribute  |Index-based_insurance|Index-Based_Insurance|  uses models of how climate extremes affect crop production to define certain climate triggers that if surpassed have high probabilities of causing substantial crop loss. When harvest losses occur associated with exceeding the climate trigger threshold, the index-insured farmer is entitled to a compensation payment.     |Earthquake_insurance|Earthquake_Insurance|  is a form of property insurance that pays the policyholder in the event of an  |earthquake|Earthquake|  that causes damage to the property. Most ordinary home insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage. Earthquake insurance policies generally feature a high  |deductible|Deductible| . Rates depend on location and hence the likelihood of an earthquake, as well as the  |construction_of_the_home|Earthquake_Engineering| .    |Fidelity_bond|Fidelity_Bond|  is a form of casualty insurance that covers policyholders for losses incurred as a result of fraudulent acts by specified individuals. It usually insures a business for losses caused by the dishonest acts of its employees.       |Flood_insurance|Flood_Insurance|  protects against property loss due to flooding. Many U.S. insurers do not provide flood insurance in some parts of the country. In response to this, the federal government created the  |National_Flood_Insurance_Program|National_Flood_Insurance_Program|  which serves as the insurer of last resort.    |Home_insurance|Home_Insurance| , also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowners insurance , provides coverage for damage or destruction of the policyholders home. In some geographical areas, the policy may exclude certain types of risks, such as flood or earthquake, that require additional coverage. Maintenance-related issues are typically the homeowners responsibility. The policy may include inventory, or this can be bought as a separate policy, especially for people who rent housing. In some countries, insurers offer a package which may include liability and legal responsibility for injuries and property damage caused by members of the household, including pets.     |Landlord_insurance|Landlords_Insurance|  covers residential or commercial property that is rented to tenants. It also covers the landlords liability for the occupants at the property. Most homeowners insurance, meanwhile, cover only owner-occupied homes and not liability or damages related to tenants.     |Marine_insurance|Marine_Insurance|  and marine cargo insurance cover the loss or damage of vessels at sea or on  |inland_waterways|Inland_Waterways_Of_The_United_States| , and of cargo in transit, regardless of the method of transit. When the owner of the cargo and the carrier are separate corporations, marine cargo insurance typically compensates the owner of cargo for losses sustained from fire, shipwreck, etc., but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier or the carriers insurance. Many marine insurance underwriters will include time element coverage in such policies, which extends the indemnity to cover loss of profit and other business expenses attributable to the delay caused by a covered loss.    |Renters_insurance|Renters_Insurance| , often called tenants insurance, is an insurance policy that provides some of the benefits of homeowners insurance, but does not include coverage for the dwelling, or structure, with the exception of small alterations that a tenant makes to the structure.   Supplemental natural disaster insurance covers specified expenses after a natural disaster renders the policyholders home uninhabitable. Periodic payments are made directly to the insured until the home is rebuilt or a specified time period has elapsed.    |Surety_bond|Surety_Bond|  insurance is a three-party insurance guaranteeing the performance of the principal.     |volcanic_eruptions|Volcano| .   Windstorm insurance is an insurance covering the damage that can be caused by wind events such as  |hurricanes|Tropical_Cyclone| .          Liability insurance is a very broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowners insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.       |Public_liability|Public_Liability|  insurance or general liability insurance covers a business or organization against claims should its operations injure a member of the public or damage their property in some way.    |Directors_and_officers_liability_insurance|Directors_And_Officers_Liability_Insurance|  protects an organization from costs associated with litigation resulting from errors made by directors and officers for which they are liable.   Environmental liability or environmental impairment insurance protects the insured from bodily injury, property damage and cleanup costs as a result of the dispersal, release or escape of pollutants.    |Errors_and_omissions_insurance|Professional_Liability_Insurance|  is business liability insurance for professionals such as insurance agents, real estate agents and brokers, architects, third-party administrators and other business professionals.    |Prize_indemnity_insurance|Prize_Indemnity_Insurance|  protects the insured from giving away a large prize at a specific event. Examples would include offering prizes to contestants who can make a half-court shot at a  |basketball|Basketball|  game, or a  |hole-in-one|Hole_In_One|  at a  |golf|Golf|  tournament.    |Professional_liability_insurance|Professional_Liability_Insurance| , also called  |professional_indemnity_insurance|Professional_Indemnity_Insurance|  , protects insured professionals such as architectural corporations and medical practitioners against potential negligence claims made by their patients/clients. Professional liability insurance may take on different names depending on the profession. For example, professional liability insurance in reference to the medical profession may be called  |medical_malpractice|Medical_Malpractice|  insurance.   Often a commercial insureds liability insurance program consists of several layers. The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements up to the limits of liability of the primary policy. Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insured to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured. In many instances, a commercial insured may elect to self-insure. Above the primary insurance or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection. There are a variety of types of excess insurance, including stand-alone excess policies , follow form excess insurance , and umbrella insurance policies .           Credit insurance repays some or all of a  |loan|Loan|  when the borrower is insolvent.    |Mortgage_insurance|Mortgage_Insurance|  insures the lender against default by the borrower. Mortgage insurance is a form of credit insurance, although the name credit insurance more often is used to refer to policies that cover other kinds of debt.   Many credit cards offer payment protection plans which are a form of credit insurance.    |Trade_credit_insurance|Trade_Credit_Insurance|  is business insurance over the accounts receivable of the insured. The policy pays the policy holder for covered accounts receivable if the debtor defaults on payment.    |Collateral_protection_insurance|Collateral_Protection_Insurance|  insures property held as collateral for loans made by lending institutions.       All-risk insurance is an insurance that covers a wide range of incidents and perils, except those noted in the policy. All-risk insurance is different from peril-specific insurance that cover losses from only those perils listed in the policy.  . Business.gov. Retrieved on 18 July 2013. In  |car_insurance|Car_Insurance| , all-risk policy includes also the damages caused by the own driver.     |horses|Horse|  or a number of horses under common ownership. Coverage is typically for mortality as a result of accident, illness or disease but may extend to include infertility, in-transit loss, veterinary fees, and prospective foal.    |Business_interruption_insurance|Business_Interruption_Insurance|  covers the loss of income, and the expenses incurred, after a covered peril interrupts normal business operations.    |Defense_Base_Act|Defense_Base_Act|  insurance provides coverage for civilian workers hired by the government to perform contracts outside the United States and Canada. DBA is required for all U.S. citizens, U.S. residents, U.S. Green Card holders, and all employees or subcontractors hired on overseas government contracts. Depending on the country, foreign nationals must also be covered under DBA. This coverage typically includes expenses related to medical treatment and loss of wages, as well as disability and death benefits.    |Expatriate_insurance|Expatriate_Insurance|  provides individuals and organizations operating outside of their home country with protection for automobiles, property, health, liability and business pursuits.    |Legal_expenses_insurance|Legal_Expenses_Insurance|  covers policyholders for the potential costs of legal action against an institution or an individual. When something happens which triggers the need for legal action, it is known as the event . There are two main types of legal expenses insurance:  |before_the_event_insurance|Legal_Expenses_Insurancebefore_The_Event_Insurance|  and  |after_the_event_insurance|Legal_Expenses_Insuranceafter_The_Event_Insurance| .   Livestock insurance is a specialist policy provided to, for example, commercial or hobby farms, aquariums, fish farms or any other animal holding. Cover is available for mortality or economic slaughter as a result of accident, illness or disease but can extend to include destruction by government order.   Media liability insurance is designed to cover professionals that engage in film and television production and print, against risks such as  |defamation|Defamation| .   Nuclear incident insurance covers damages resulting from an  |incident_involving_radioactive_materials|Nuclear_And_Radiation_Accidents|  and is generally arranged at the national level.     |Pet_insurance|Pet_Insurance|  insures pets against accidents and illnesses; some companies cover routine/wellness care and burial, as well.    |Pollution_insurance|Pollution_Insurance|  usually takes the form of first-party coverage for contamination of insured property either by external or on-site sources. Coverage is also afforded for liability to third parties arising from contamination of air, water, or land due to the sudden and accidental release of hazardous materials from the insured site. The policy usually covers the costs of cleanup and may include coverage for releases from underground storage tanks. Intentional acts are specifically excluded.   Purchase insurance is aimed at providing protection on the products people purchase. Purchase insurance can cover individual purchase protection,  |warranties|Warranties| ,  |guarantees|Guarantees| , care plans and even mobile phone insurance. Such insurance is normally very limited in the scope of problems that are covered by the policy.   Tax insurance is increasingly being used in corporate transactions to protect taxpayers in the event that a tax position it has taken is challenged by the IRS or a state, local, or foreign taxing authority     |Title_insurance|Title_Insurance|  provides a guarantee that title to  |real_property|Real_Property|  is vested in the purchaser or  |mortgagee|Mortgage_Law| , free and clear of  |liens|Lien|  or encumbrances. It is usually issued in conjunction with a search of the public records performed at the time of a  |real_estate|Real_Estate|  transaction.    |Travel_insurance|Travel_Insurance|  is an insurance cover taken by those who travel abroad, which covers certain losses such as medical expenses, loss of personal belongings, travel delay, and personal liabilities.    |Tuition_insurance|Tuition_Insurance|  insures students against involuntary withdrawal from cost-intensive educational institutions    |Interest_rate_insurance|Interest_Rate_Insurance|  protects the holder from adverse changes in interest rates, for instance for those with a variable rate loan or mortgage   Divorce insurance is a form of contractual liability insurance that pays the insured a cash benefit if their marriage ends in divorce.       Fraternal insurance is provided on a cooperative basis by  |fraternal_benefit_societies|Benefit_Society|  or other social organizations. Margaret E. Lynch, Editor, Health Insurance Terminology , Health Insurance Association of America, 1992,     |No-fault_insurance|No-Fault_Insurance|  is a type of insurance policy where insureds are indemnified by their own insurer regardless of fault in the incident.   Protected self-insurance is an alternative risk financing mechanism in which an organization retains the mathematically calculated cost of risk within the organization and transfers the catastrophic risk with specific and aggregate limits to an insurer so the maximum total cost of the program is known. A properly designed and underwritten Protected Self-Insurance Program reduces and stabilizes the cost of insurance and provides valuable risk management information.   Retrospectively rated insurance is a method of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts. The final premium is based on the insureds actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current years premium is based partially on the current years losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current years expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium converted loss + basic premium × tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.   Formal  |self-insurance|Self-Insurance|  is the deliberate decision to pay for otherwise insurable losses out of ones own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually used to pay for high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the companys general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.  |Reinsurance|Reinsurance|  is a type of insurance purchased by insurance companies or self-insured employers to protect against unexpected losses.  |Financial_reinsurance|Financial_Reinsurance|  is a form of reinsurance that is primarily used for capital management rather than to transfer insurance risk.    |Social_insurance|Social_Insurance|  can be many things to many people in many countries. But a summary of its essence is that it is a collection of insurance coverages , plus retirement savings, that requires participation by all citizens. By forcing everyone in society to be a policyholder and pay premiums, it ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if he/she needs to. Along the way, this inevitably becomes related to other concepts such as the justice system and the  |welfare_state|Welfare_State| . This is a large, complicated topic that engenders tremendous debate, which can be further studied in the following articles :    |National_Insurance|National_Insurance| |Social_safety_net|Social_Safety_Net| |Social_security|Social_Security| |Social_Security_debate|Social_Security_Debate| |Social_Security|Social_Security| |Social_welfare_provision|Social_Welfare_Provision| |Stop-loss_insurance|Stop-Loss_Insurance|  provides protection against catastrophic or unpredictable losses. It is purchased by organizations who do not want to assume 100% of the liability for losses arising from the plans. Under a stop-loss policy, the insurance company becomes liable for losses that exceed certain limits called deductibles.       Some communities prefer to create virtual insurance amongst themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number of  |religious|Religion|  groups, including the  |Amish|Amish|  and some  |Muslim|Muslim|  groups, depend on support provided by their  |communities|Community|  when  |disasters|Disaster|  strike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work. In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking the  |moral_hazard|Moral_Hazard|  of explicit insurance contracts.     In the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| ,  |The_Crown|The_Crown|   did not insure property such as government buildings. If a government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums. Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property companies and rented back, this arrangement is now less common and may have disappeared altogether.     In the United States, the most prevalent form of  |self-insurance|Self-Insurance|  is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage for the majority of governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts. Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a  |risk_pool|Risk_Pool| . Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates , increased benefits and subject matter expertise. Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools. Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually. Marcos Antonio Mendoza, Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions , 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 55-60              Insurance companies may sell any combination of insurance types, but are often classified into three groups:       |Life_insurance|Life_Insurance|  companies, which sell life insurance, annuities and pensions products and bear similarities to  |asset_management|Asset_Management|  businesses   Non-life or  |property|Property_Insurance| / |casualty_insurance|Casualty_Insurance|  companies, which sell other types of insurance.    |Health_insurance|Health_Insurance|  companies, which sometimes sell life insurance or  |employee_benefits|Employee_Benefits|  as well     General insurance companies can be further divided into these sub categories.   Standard lines    |Excess_lines|Excess_Lines|      In most countries, life and non-life insurers are subject to different regulatory regimes and different  |tax|Tax|  and  |accounting|Accounting|  rules. The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is very long-term in nature – coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many  |decades|Decade| . By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.          Insurance companies are generally classified as either  |mutual|Mutual_Insurance|  or proprietary companies.  Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while shareholders own proprietary insurance companies.      |Demutualization|Demutualization|  of mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century. However, not all states permit mutual holding companies.          |Reinsurance|Reinsurance|  companies are insurance companies that sell policies to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from very large losses. The reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large companies, with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well.             |Captive_insurance|Captive_Insurance|  companies may be defined as limited-purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent companys customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a pure entity ; of a mutual captive ; and of an association captive . Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.     The types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captives exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.     Captives are becoming an increasingly important component of the  |risk_management|Risk_Management|  and risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:   Heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage   Difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk   Differential coverage standards in various parts of the world   Rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience   Insufficient credit for deductibles or loss control efforts       Other possible forms for an insurance company include  |reciprocals|Reciprocal_Inter-Insurance_Exchange| , in which policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks, and Lloyds organizations.       Admitted insurance companies are those in the United States that have been admitted or licensed by the state licensing agency. The insurance they sell is called admitted insurance. Non-admitted companies have not been approved by the state licensing agency, but are allowed to sell insurance under special circumstances when they meet an insurance need that admitted companies cannot or will not meet.          There are also companies known as insurance consultants . Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. Similar to an insurance consultant, an insurance broker also shops around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.     Neither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions. Third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies. These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.         The financial stability and strength of an insurance company should be a major consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future. For that reason, the viability of the insurance carrier is very important. In recent years, a number of insurance companies have become insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage . A number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.     Insurance companies are rated by various agencies such as  |A._M._Best|A._&_Nbsp;M._Best| . The ratings include the companys financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.               Global insurance premiums grew by 2.7% in inflation-adjusted terms in 2010 to $4.3 trillion, climbing above pre-crisis levels. The return to growth and record premiums generated during the year followed two years of decline in real terms. Life insurance premiums increased by 3.2% in 2010 and non-life premiums by 2.1%. While industrialised countries saw an increase in premiums of around 1.4%, insurance markets in emerging economies saw rapid expansion with 11% growth in premium income. The global insurance industry was sufficiently capitalised to withstand the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and most insurance companies restored their capital to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2010. With the continuation of the gradual recovery of the global economy, it is likely the insurance industry will continue to see growth in premium income both in industrialised countries and emerging markets in 2011.     Advanced economies account for the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most important region in 2010, followed by North America $1.41 trillion and Asia $1.16 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the worlds population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace.    p. 2 The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China. According to  |Sam_Radwan|Sam_Radwan|  of  |ENHANCE_International_LLC|Enhance_International_Llc| , low premium penetration , an ageing population and the largest car market in terms of new sales, premium growth has averaged 15–20% in the past five years, and China is expected to be the largest insurance market in the next decade or two. Sam Radwan,  , Bloomberg Businessweek, June 2010.          In the United States, insurance is regulated by the states under the  |McCarran-Ferguson_Act|Mccarran–Ferguson_Act| , with periodic proposals for federal intervention , and a nonprofit coalition of state insurance agencies called the  |National_Association_of_Insurance_Commissioners|National_Association_Of_Insurance_Commissioners|  works to harmonize the countrys different laws and regulations.

Insurance is just a risk transfer mechanism wherein the financial burden which may arise due to some fortuitous event is transferred to a bigger entity called an Insurance Company by way of paying premiums. This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured. The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a  |risk_assessment|Risk_Assessment|  when writing the policy. As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim. If a person is financially stable and plans for lifes unexpected events, they may be able to go without insurance. However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions. Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.       An insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they might otherwise be , a concept known as  |moral_hazard|Moral_Hazard| . This insulates many from the   true costs of living with risk, negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentially maladaptive.  To reduce their own financial exposure, insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liability.     For example, life insurance companies may require higher premiums or deny coverage altogether to people who work in hazardous occupations or engage in dangerous sports. Liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from  |intentional_torts|Intentional_Tort|  committed by or at the direction of the insured. Even if a provider desired to provide such coverage, it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist, and thus it is usually illegal.          Insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business, including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may be  |advertised|Advertising|  and sold.     For example, most insurance policies in the English language today have been carefully drafted in  |plain_English|Plain_English| ; the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying. Typically, courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy.     Many institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker. While on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer , and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, in the vast majority of cases a brokers compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the brokers financial interest is tilted towards encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to shop the  |market|Market|  for the best rates and coverage possible.     Insurance may also be purchased through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys . Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.     An independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee-for-service retainer, similar to an attorney, and thus offers completely independent advice, free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents. However, such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients.       In the United States, economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, but not for high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high  |deductibles|Deductible|  and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from  |moral_hazard|Moral_Hazard| . Schindler, R. M. . .

Ringold , Chicago, IL: American Marketing Association, 147–155.        |Redlining|Redlining|  is the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination.  |Racial_profiling|Racial_Profiling|  or  |redlining|Redlining|  has a long history in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry. Gregory D. Squires   Racial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas Journal of Urban Affairs Volume 25 Issue 4 pp. 391–410, November 2003     In July 2007, The  |Federal_Trade_Commission|Federal_Trade_Commission|  released a report presenting the results of a study concerning credit-based  |insurance_scores|Insurance_Score|  in automobile insurance. The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers. , Federal Trade Commission The report was disputed by representatives of the  |Consumer_Federation_of_America|Consumer_Federation_Of_America| , the National Fair Housing Alliance, the  |National_Consumer_Law_Center|National_Consumer_Law_Center| , and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.  www.consumeraffairs.com     All states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination, often called redlining, in setting rates and making insurance available.      In determining premiums and premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location,  |credit_scores|Credit_Score| ,  |gender|Gender| ,  |occupation|Profession| ,  |marital_status|Marital_Status| , and  |education|Education|  level. However, the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully  |discriminatory|Discrimination| , and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.     An insurance underwriters job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent. Thus, discrimination against potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting. For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people . The rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss is greater in any given period of time and therefore the  |risk_premium|Risk_Premium|  must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.             New assurance products can now be protected from copying with a  |business_method_patent|Business_Method_Patent|  in the  |United_States|United_States| .     A recent example of a new insurance product that is patented is  |Usage_Based|Usage-Based_Insurance| |auto_insurance|Vehicle_Insurance| . Early versions were independently invented and patented by a major US auto insurance company,  |Progressive_Auto_Insurance|Progressive_Corporation|   and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez .     Many independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market. Independent inventors account for 70% of the new U.S. patent applications in this area.     Many insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them.  |The_Hartford|The_Hartford|  insurance company, for example, recently had to pay $80 million to an independent inventor, Bancorp Services, in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by Bancorp.     There are currently about 150 new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the United States. The rate at which patents have been issued has steadily risen from 15 in 2002 to 44 in 2006.      The first insurance patent to be granted was  including another example of an application posted was . It was posted on 6 March 2009. This patent application describes a method for increasing the ease of changing insurance companies. Bakos, Nowotarski,  , Insurance IP Bulletin, 15 December 2008.       Insurance on demand is an insurance service that provides clients with insurance protection when they need, i.e. only episodic rather than on  |24/7|24/7_Service|  basis as typically provided by traditional insurers .       Certain insurance products and practices have been described as  |rent-seeking|Rent-Seeking|  by critics. That is, some insurance products or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under  |United_States_tax_law|United_States_Tax_Law| , for example, most owners of  |variable_annuities|Annuity|  and  |variable_life_insurance|Variable_Universal_Life_Insurance|  can invest their premium payments in the  |stock_market|Stock_Market|  and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an  |estate_tax|Inheritance_Tax|  while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.       Muslim scholars have varying opinions about life insurance. Life insurance policies that earn interest are generally considered to be a form of  riba    and some consider even policies that do not earn interest to be a form of gharar . Some argue that gharar is not present due to the actuarial science behind the underwriting.    Jewish rabbinical scholars also have expressed reservations regarding insurance as an avoidance of Gods will but most find it acceptable in moderation.      Some Christians believe insurance represents a lack of faith   and there is a long history of resistance to commercial insurance in  |Anabaptist|Anabaptist|  communities  but many participate in community-based self-insurance programs that spread risk within their communities.
