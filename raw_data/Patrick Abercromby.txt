           Patrick Abercromby  was a Scottish physician and  |antiquarian|Antiquarian| , noted for being physician to  |King_James_VII_|James_Ii_Of_England|  and his fervent opposition to the  |Act_of_Union|Acts_Of_Union_1707|  between  |Scotland|Scotland|  and  |England|England| .       Patrick Abercromby was the third son of  |Alexander_Abercromby|Alexander_Abercromby|  of  |Fetterneir|Fetternear_Palace|  in  |Aberdeenshire|Aberdeenshire| , and brother of  |Francis_Abercromby|Francis_Abercromby_Lord_Glasford| , who was created  |Lord_Glasford|Lord_Glasford|  by  |King_James_II|James_Ii_Of_England| . He was born at  |Forfar|Forfar|  in 1656 apparently of a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  family.     Intending to become a doctor of medicine he entered the  |University_of_St_Andrews|University_Of_St_Andrews| , where he took his degree of M.D. in 1685, but apparently he spent most of his youthful years abroad. It has been stated that he attended the university of  |Paris|Paris| ,  |France|France| . A Discourse of Wit , sometimes assigned to him, belongs to Dr  |David_Abercromby|David_Abercromby| .       On his return to Scotland, he is found practising as a physician in  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| , where, besides his professional duties, he gave himself with characteristic zeal to the study of antiquities. He was appointed physician to James II in 1685, but the revolution deprived him of the post. Living during the agitations for the union of  |England|England|  and  |Scotland|Scotland| , he took part as a  |Jacobite|Jacobitism|  in the war of pamphlets inaugurated and sustained by prominent men on both sides of the Border, and he crossed swords with no less redoubtable a foe than  |Daniel_Defoe|Daniel_Defoe|  in his Advantages of the Act of Security compared with those of the intended Union , and A Vindication of the Same against Mr De Foe .       A minor literary work of Abercrombys was a translation of  |Jean_de_Beaugués|Jean_De_Beaugué|  Histoire de la guerre dÉcosse which appeared in 1707. But the work with which his name is permanently associated is his Martial Atchievements sic of the Scots Nation, issued in two large folios, vol. i. 1711, vol. ii. 1716. In the title-page and preface to vol. i. he disclaims the ambition of being an historian, but in vol. ii., in title-page and preface alike, he is no longer a simple biographer, but an historian. Even though, read in the light of later research, much of the first volume must necessarily be relegated to the region of the mythical, nonetheless, the historian was a laborious and accomplished reader and investigator of all available authorities, as well manuscript as printed; while the roll of names of those who aided him includes every man of note in  |Scotland|Scotland|  at the time, from  |Sir_Thomas_Craig|Sir_Thomas_Craig|  and  |Sir_George_Mackenzie|Sir_George_Mackenzie|  to  |Alexander_Nisbet|Alexander_Nisbet|  and  |Thomas_Ruddiman|Thomas_Ruddiman| .       The date of Abercrombys death is uncertain. It has been variously assigned to 1715, 1716, 1720, and 1726, and it is usually added that he left a widow in great poverty. The Memoirs of the Abercrombys, commonly attributed to him, do not appear to have been published.       Translation;  .
