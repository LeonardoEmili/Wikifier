      Camelot is a  |castle|Castle|  and  |court|Court|  associated with the legendary  |King_Arthur|King_Arthur| . Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, after the  |Lancelot_Grail|Lancelot_Grail|  cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthurs realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world.     The stories locate it somewhere in  |Great_Britain|Great_Britain|  and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its unspecified geography being perfect for  |chivalric_romance|Chivalric_Romance|  writers. Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the real Camelot have occurred since the 15th century and continue to rage today in popular works and for tourism purposes.       The names derivation is uncertain. It has numerous different spellings in medieval French Arthurian romances, including Camaalot, Camalot, Chamalot, Camehelot , Camaaloth, Caamalot, Camahaloth, Camaelot, Kamaalot, Kamaaloth, Kaamalot, Kamahaloth, Kameloth, Kamaelot, Kamelot, Kaamelot, Cameloth, Camelot and Gamalaot.

Arthurian scholar  |Ernst_Brugger|Ernst_Brugger|  suggested that it was a corruption of the site of Arthurs final battle, the  |Battle_of_Camlann|Battle_Of_Camlann| , in Welsh tradition.  |Roger_Sherman_Loomis|Roger_Sherman_Loomis|  believed it was derived from Cavalon, a place name that he suggested was a corruption of  |Avalon|Avalon|  . He further suggested that Cavalon became Arthurs capital due to confusion with Arthurs other traditional court at  |Carlion|Caerleon|  .     Others have suggested a derivation from the  |British_Iron_Age|British_Iron_Age|  and  |Romano_British|Roman_Britain|  place name  |Camulodunum|Camulodunum| , one of the first capitals of  |Roman_Britain|Roman_Britain|  and which would have significance in  |Romano_British_culture|Romano_British_Culture| . Indeed,  |John_Morris|John_Morris| , the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  and the history of  |Sub_Roman_Britain|Sub_Roman_Britain| , suggested in his book The Age of Arthur that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name Camelot of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of  |Britannia|Britannia|  in Roman times. It is unclear, however, where  |Chrétien_de_Troyes|Chrétien_De_Troyes|  would have encountered the name Camulodunum, or why he would render it as Camaalot, though  |Urban_T_Holmes|Urban_T_Holmes_Jr_|  argued in 1929 that Chrétien had access to Book 2 of  |Plinys_Natural_History|Natural_History| , where it is rendered as Camaloduno.

Given Chrétiens known tendency to create new stories and characters, being the first to mention the hero  |Lancelots|Lancelot|  love affair with Queen  |Guinevere|Guinevere|  for example, the name might also be entirely invented.       Arthurs court at Camelot is mentioned for the first time in Chrétiens poem  Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart , dating to the 1170s, though it does not appear in all the manuscripts. In the C manuscript , which might in fact contain the proper reading of Chretiens original text, Wolfgang, Lenora D., Chretiens Lancelot: Love and Philology, Reading Medieval Studies, 17 , pp. 3-17 . instead of the place name we find the  |Old_French|Old_French|  phrase con lui plot, meaning as he pleased . The other manuscripts spell the name variously as Chamalot , Camehelot , Chamaalot , and Camalot the name is missing, along with the rest of the passage containing it, in MS V Vatican, Biblioteca Vaticana, Regina 1725 |man|Man| 1991Ed.1991Ed.Perlesvaus, the Didot Perceval attributed to  |Robert_de_Boron|Robert_De_Boron| , and even the early romances of Chrétien such as  Erec and Enide  and  Yvain, the Knight of the Lion  |tiqua|Tiqua| London |mers|Mers| modern  |Colchester|Colchester| also making close to  |North_Wales|North_Wales| 1991Ed. |veli|Veli| |view_from_Tintagel_Castle|View_From_Tintagel_Castle| musicalTV seriesvideo gamemagazinemagazine .
