Therefore, I is not maximal. Conversely, if I is not maximal, then there is a right ideal J properly containing I.

The kernel of this homomorphism is a right ideal I of R, and a standard theorem states that M is isomorphic to R/I. By the above paragraph, we find that I is a maximal right ideal. Therefore, M is isomorphic to a quotient of R by a maximal right ideal.     If k is a ": null
