In  |poker|Poker| , the strength of a  |hand|Rank_Of_Hands|  is often called its value; however, in the context of  |poker_strategy|Poker_Strategy|  the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic, a bet for value. This bet is intended to increase the size of the pot, by inducing opponents to call. A bet for value is in contrast to a  bluff  or a  protection bet .     For a bet for value to be correct, a player must have a positive  |expectation|Expected_Value| , that is, he will win more than one bet for every bet he puts in the pot. Note that  |pot_odds|Poker_Strategypot_Odds_And_Poker_Probabilities|  do not matter in this situation, because the factor here is whether it is more profitable to raise or call, rather than to call or fold. Betting for value can apply to both  |made_hand|Made_Hand|  and  |drawing_hand|Draw|  situations, although in the latter situation it is less often correct, as the drawing hands chances of winning are generally lower. Many made hands will win the pot more than 50% of the time, therefore a value bet is usually correct, even  |heads_up|List_Of_Poker_Termsheads_Up| .     For example, in a game of  |Texas_hold_em|Texas_Hold_Em| , a player has 8♣ 6♠ with a flop of  9♥ 7♦ 2♣, The player has an open-ended straight draw and so has eight outs . With 47 unknown cards, the player will make the straight approximately one time for every five times he doesnt, thus a bet is profitable if six or more of his opponents will call the bet  .
