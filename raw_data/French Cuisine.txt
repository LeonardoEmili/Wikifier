                    French cuisine consists of the  |cooking|Cooking|  traditions and practices from  |France|France| .     French cuisine developed throughout the centuries influenced by the many surrounding cultures of Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, in addition to its own food traditions on the long western coastlines of the Atlantic, the Channel and of course inland. In the 14th century  |Guillaume_Tirel|Guillaume_Tirel| , a  |court|Court| |_chef|Chef|  known as Taillevent , wrote  Le Viandier , one of the earliest  |recipe|Recipe|  collections of  |medieval_France|France_In_The_Middle_Ages| . In the 17th century, chefs  |François_Pierre_La_Varenne|François_Pierre_La_Varenne|  and  |Marie_Antoine_Carême|Marie_Antoine_Carême|  spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed Frances own indigenous style.  |Cheese|French_Cheese|  and  |wine|French_Wine|  are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and  appellation dorigine contrôlée  laws.     French cuisine was made important in the 20th century by  |Auguste_Escoffier|Auguste_Escoffier|  to become the modern  |haute_cuisine|Haute_Cuisine| ; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the  |regions_of_France|Regions_Of_France|  and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks.  |Culinary_tourism|Culinary_Tourism|  and the  Guide Michelin  helped to acquaint people with the  cuisine bourgeoise  of the urban elites and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century.  |Gascon|Gascony|  cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.     Knowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and  |culinary_education|Culinary_Art| . In November 2010, French  |gastronomy|Gastronomy|  was added by the  |UNESCO|Unesco|  to its lists of the worlds  |_intangible_cultural_heritage_|Unesco_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists| .  Dallas Morning News                 In French  |medieval_cuisine|Medieval_Cuisine| , banquets were common among the  |aristocracy|Aristocracy| . Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the  |Late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages|  that the  |shortcrust|Shortcrust_Pastry|  pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of  dragée s , aged cheese and spiced wine, such as  |hypocras|Hypocras| .       The ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were  |brine|Brine| d and dried. Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during  |Lent|Lent| , the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.      Artificial freshwater ponds  held  |carp|Carp| ,  |pike|Pike| ,  |tench|Tench| ,  |bream|Bream| ,  |eel|Eel| , and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and  |squab|Squab|  being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included  |venison|Venison| ,  |wild_boar|Wild_Boar| , hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as  |tansy|Tansy| ,  |rue|Rue| ,  |pennyroyal|Mentha_Pulegium| , and  |hyssop|Hyssop| , which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and  |mace|Mace| . Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are  |cubebs|Cubeb| , long pepper ,  |grains_of_paradise|Grains_Of_Paradise| , and  |galengale|Galangal| . Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and  verjus  combined with sugar or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.      Visual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of  |leeks|Leek| . Yellow came from  |saffron|Saffron|  or egg yolk, while red came from  |sunflower|Sunflower| , and purple came from  Crozophora tinctoria  or  Heliotropium europaeum . Gold and  |silver_leaf|Metal_Leaf|  were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with  |gold_leaf|Gold_Leaf| . One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast  |swan|Swan|  or  |peacock|Peafowl|  sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being  |gilded|Gilded| . Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.      The most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was  |Guillaume_Tirel|Guillaume_Tirel| , also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to  |Philip_VI|Philip_Vi_Of_France| , then the  |Dauphin|Dauphin_Of_France|  who was son of  |John_II|John_Ii_Of_France| . The Dauphin became King  |Charles_V_of_France|Charles_V_Of_France|  in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, marmites, on it.          Paris was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as  Les Halles , la Mégisserie, those found along  Rue Mouffetard , and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the  |guild|Guild|  system, which developed in the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| . In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.      There were two groups of guilds – first, those that supplied the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers,  |pastry_cooks|Pastry_Chef| , sauce makers, poulterers, and  |caterers|Caterer| . There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the  charcutiers  and rôtisseurs . They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.  The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the  |guild|Guild|  hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks guild regulations allowed for this movement.      During the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the  |New_World|New_World| . Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show  |Catherine_de_Medici|Catherine_De_Medici|  serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.  The dish called  |cassoulet|Cassoulet|  has its roots in the New World discovery of  |haricot_beans|Haricot_Bean| , which are central to the dishs creation, but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus| .       |Haute_cuisine|Haute_Cuisine|   has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named  |La_Varenne|François_Pierre_La_Varenne| . As author of works such as Le Cuisinier françois, he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to  |roux|Roux|  using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for  |fasting|Fasting| . His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled Le Parfait confitvrier  which similarly updated and codified the emerging haute cuisine standards for desserts and pastries.      Chef  |François_Massialot|François_Massialot|  wrote Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois in 1691, during the reign of  |Louis_XIV|Louis_Xiv| . The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a  |marinade|Marinade|  is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.      The successive updates of Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to  |fish_stock|Stock| . Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois, was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal.  |Ragout|Ragout| , a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.                Shortly before the French Revolution, dishes like  |bouchées_à_la_Reine|Bouchées_À_La_Reine|  gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on  |vol_au_vent|Vol_Au_Vent|  created under the influence of Queen  |Marie_Leszczyńska|Marie_Leszczyńska| , the wife of  |Louis_XV|Louis_Xv| . This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczyńska like  |consommé_à_la_Reine|Consommé_À_La_Reine|  and  |filet_daloyau_braisé_à_la_royale|Filet_Daloyau_Braisé_À_La_Royale| . Queen Marie is also credited with introducing  |lentilles|Lentille|  to the French diet.     The  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Bread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation’s people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France.  According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup. In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there was fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708-1789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.      |Marie_Antoine_Carême|Marie_Antoine_Carême|  was born in 1784, five years before the  |Revolution|French_Revolution| . He spent his younger years working at a  pâtisserie  until he was discovered by  |Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand_Périgord|Charles_Maurice_De_Talleyrand_Périgord| , who would later cook for  |Napoleon_Bonaparte|Napoleon_Bonaparte| . Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Carême had become known for his  pièces montées , which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.       More important to Carêmes career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named  |mother_sauces|Mother_Sauce| . Often referred to as  |fonds|Fond| , meaning foundations , these base sauces,  espagnole ,  velouté , and  béchamel , are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Carême had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, soufflés appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were Le Maître dhôtel français , Le Cuisinier parisien and LArt de la cuisine française au dix-neuvième siècle .            |Georges_Auguste_Escoffier|Georges_Auguste_Escoffier|  is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of  |haute_cuisine|Haute_Cuisine|  and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s – 1890s. The  |Savoy_Hotel|Savoy_Hotel|  managed by  |César_Ritz|César_Ritz|  was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of parties called the  |brigade_system|Brigade_System| , which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations.     These five stations included the  |garde_manger|Garde_Manger|  that prepared cold dishes; the entremettier prepared starches and vegetables, the rôtisseur prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the  |saucier|Saucier|  prepared sauces and soups; and the pâtissier prepared all pastry and desserts items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on ones own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is oeufs au plat Meyerbeer , the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the rôtisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.      Escoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the  |service_à_la_russe|Service_À_La_Russe|  , which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffiers largest contribution was the publication of  Le Guide Culinaire  in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.      Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter  |fumets|White_Stock| , which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevents Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.     Expensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as  |pêche_Melba|Pêche_Melba| .  Escoffier updated Le Guide Culinaire four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the books first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an exhaustive text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day.           The 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine, especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the  |Colonial_Wars|Portuguese_Colonial_War|  Portugal was fighting in Africa. Many new dishes were introduced, as well as techniques.     This period is also marked by the appearance of the  |nouvelle_cuisine|Nouvelle_Cuisine| . The term nouvelle cuisine has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s,  |Menon|Menon|  first used the term, but the cooking of  |Vincent_La_Chapelle|Vincent_La_Chapelle|  and François Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s,  |Henri_Gault|Henri_Gault|  and  |Christian_Millau|Christian_Millau|  revived it to describe the cooking of  |Paul_Bocuse|Paul_Bocuse| ,  |Jean|Jean_Troisgros|  and  |Pierre_Troisgros|Pierre_Troisgros| ,  |Michel_Guérard|Michel_Guérard| , Roger Vergé and  |Raymond_Oliver|Raymond_Oliver| . Joyeuse encyclopédie anecdotique de la gastronomie,  |Michel_Ferracci_Porri|Michel_Ferracci_Porri|  and Maryline Paoli, Preface by Christian Millau, Ed. Normant 2012, France  These chefs were working toward rebelling against the orthodoxy of  |Escoffiers|Escoffier|  cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of  |Fernand_Point|Fernand_Point|  at the  Pyramide  in  |Vienne|Vienne| , and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau discovered the formula contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.      The first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and pâtés was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as  |espagnole|Espagnole|  and béchamel thickened with flour based roux , in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of haute cuisine dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.      Some have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.  By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.           There are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today.     A meal often consists of three courses, hors dœuvre or entrée , plat principal , fromage or dessert Basil salmon terrine   Bisque  is a smooth and creamy French  potage   Foie gras  with mustard seeds and green onions in duck  jus   Croque monsieur   Pot-au-feu  is a  cuisine classique   Steak frites   pâtisserie   Mille-feuille    |Eclair|Eclair|   Crème brûlée   Mousse au chocolat    |Café_liégeois|Café_Liégeois|                 French regional cuisine is characterized by its extreme diversity and style. Traditionally, each region of France has its own distinctive cuisine.    . Accessed July 2011.       Paris and Île-de-France are central regions where almost anything from the country is available, as all train lines meet in the city. Over 9,000 restaurants exist in Paris and almost any cuisine can be obtained here. High-quality  |Michelin_Guide|Michelin_Guide| -rated restaurants proliferate here.

The northern areas of this region, especially Nord , grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory . Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some of the best in the country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the regions  |galettes|Galette|  , called jalet  |Crème_Chantilly|Crème_Chantillycrème_Chantilly| |_Camembert|Camembert| |_Crêpe|Crêpe|  and  |Cider|Ciderfrance|  Belon oysters         High-quality fruits come from the Loire Valley and central France, including cherries grown for the liqueur  |Guignolet|Guignolet|  and the Belle Angevine pears.
