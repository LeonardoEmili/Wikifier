        ", there are many  logarithm ic identities .                  Logarithms and exponentials with the same base cancel each other. This is true because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations .     : b x  x     :   x  x     Both of the above are derived from the following two equations that define a logarithm:     : bc x  c     Substituting  in the left equation gives , and substituting  in the right gives . Finally, replace  with .         Logarithms can be used to make calculations easier. For example, two numbers can be multiplied just by using a logarithm table and adding. The first three operations below assume , and/or  so that  and . Derivations also use the log definitions  and .          Where b , x , and y are positive real numbers and b   1 . Both c and d are real numbers.     The laws result from canceling exponentials and appropriate law of indices. Starting with the first law:     xy b b b         +       The law for powers exploits another of the laws of indices:     xy y b     y       The law relating to quotients then follows:             +     -             -       Similarly, the root law is derived by rewriting the root as a reciprocal power:                   :   a      This identity is useful to evaluate logarithms on calculators. For instance, most calculators have buttons for ": null
