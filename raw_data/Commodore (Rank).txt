     Commodore is a  |naval_rank|Military_Rank|  used in many  |navies|Navy|  that is superior to a navy  |captain|Captain| , but below a  |rear_admiral|Rear_Admiral| . Non-English-speaking nations often use the rank of  |flotilla_admiral|Flotilla_Admiral| ,  |counter_admiral|Counter_Admiral| , or  |senior_captain|Senior_Captain|  as an equivalent, although counter admiral may also correspond to rear admiral.     Traditionally, commodore is the title for any officer assigned to command more than one ship at a time, even temporarily, much as captain is the traditional title for the commanding officer of a single ship even if the officers official title in the service is a lower rank. As an official rank, a commodore typically commands a  |flotilla|Flotilla|  or  |squadron|Squadron|  of ships as part of a larger  |task_force|Task_Force|  or  |naval_fleet|Naval_Fleet|  commanded by an  |admiral|Admiral| . A commodores ship is typically designated by the flying of a  |broad_pennant|Broad_Pennant| , as opposed to an admirals flag.     It is often regarded as a  |one-star_rank|One-Star_Rank|  with a  |NATO|Nato|  code of  |OF-6|Of-6|  , but whether it is regarded as a  |flag_rank|Flag_Rank|  varies between countries. Whether commodore is a  |flag_rank|Flag_Rank|  varies by country. Often, rear admiral is the first of the flag ranks . For example, it was not until 2001 that the UK made commodore a flag rank , and changed the shoulder rank insignia of the higher ranking admirals accordingly. Australia made this change in the mid-1990s, and also changed the commodore rank insignia to include a star.     It is sometimes abbreviated: as Cdre in British Royal Navy, CDRE in the US Navy, Cmdre in the Royal Canadian Navy, COMO in the Spanish Navy and in some navies speaking the Spanish language, or CMDE as used in some other Navies of several countries. The Cdre abbreviation for the OF-6 rank of commodore is sometimes confused with the Cmdr abbreviation for the OF-4 rank of  |commander|Commander|  .       The rank of commodore derives from the  |French|French_Language|  commandeur, which was one of the highest ranks in the  |orders_of_knighthood|Orders_Of_Knighthood| , and in  |military_orders|Military_Order|  the title of the knight in charge of a commande .       The  |Dutch_Navy|Dutch_Navy|  also used the rank of  commandeur  from the end of the 16th century for a variety of temporary positions, until it became a conventional permanent rank in 1955. The  |Royal_Netherlands_Air_Force|Royal_Netherlands_Air_Force|  has adopted the English spelling of commodore for an equivalent rank.     In the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy| ,  |the_position|Commodore|  was introduced in the 17th Century to combat the cost of appointing more admirals—a costly business with a fleet as large as the Royal Navys at that time.     The rank of commodore was at first a position created as a temporary title to be bestowed upon captains who commanded  |squadrons|Squadron|  of more than one vessel. In many navies, the rank of commodore was merely viewed as a  |senior_captain|Senior_Captain|  position, whereas other naval services bestowed upon the rank of commodore the prestige of  |flag_officer|Flag_Officer|  status.          In 1899, the substantive rank of commodore was discontinued in the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy| , but revived during World War II in both the U.S. Navy and  |U.S._Coast_Guard|U.S._Coast_Guard| . It was discontinued as a rank in these services during the postwar period, but as an appointment, the title commodore was then used to identify senior  |U.S._Navy_captains|Captain|  who commanded squadrons of more than one vessel or functional air wings or air groups that were not part of a carrier air wing or carrier air group. Concurrently, until the early 1980s,  |U.S._Navy|U.S._Navy|  and  |U.S._Coast_Guard|U.S._Coast_Guard|  captains selected for promotion to the rank of  |rear_admiral|Rear_Admiral|  , would wear the same insignia as rear admiral , i.e., two silver stars for collar insignia or sleeve braid of one wide and one narrow gold stripe, even though they were actually only equivalent to one-star officers and paid at the one-star rate.     To correct this inequity, the rank of commodore as a single star flag officer was reinstated by both services in the early 1980s. This immediately caused confusion with those senior U.S. Navy captains commanding destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons, functional air wings and air groups, and so on, who held the temporary title of commodore while in their major command billet. As a result of this confusion, the services soon renamed the new one-star rank as  |commodore_admiral|Commodore_Admiral|  within the first six months following the ranks reintroduction. However, this was considered an awkward title and the one-star flag rank was renamed a few months later to its current title of rear admiral , later abbreviated by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard as RDML.     The title of commodore continues to be used in the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard for those senior captains in command of organizations consisting of groups of ships or submarines organized into  |squadrons|Squadron| ; air wings or air groups of multiple  |aviation_squadrons|Squadron|  other than carrier air wings ; explosive ordnance disposal , mine warfare and special warfare  groups; Mobile Inshore Underwater Warfare groups; and construction  regiments. Although not flag officers, modern day commodores in the U.S. Navy rate a blue and white command pennant, also known as a  |broad_pennant|Broad_Pennant| , that is normally flown at their headquarters facilities ashore or from ships that they are embarked aboard when they are the senior officer present afloat .       In the Argentine Navy, the position of commodore was created in the late 1990s, and is usually, but not always, issued to senior captains holding rear-admirals positions. It is not a rank but a distinction and, as such, can be issued by the chief of staff without congressional approval. Its equivalents are colonel-major in the Army and commodore-major in the Air Force. It is usually—but incorrectly—referred to as navy commodore , to avoid confusion with the air force commodore , which is equivalent to the navys captain and armys colonel. The sleeve lace is identical to that of the Royal Navy, and wears one star on the epaulette.       The following articles deal with the rank of commodore as it is employed  |OF-6|Of-6| |one-star|One-Star_Rank|  flag officer rank in various countries.    comodoro, is a rank in the  |Argentine_Air_Force|Argentine_Air_Force| . This rank is the equivalent of a  |colonel|Colonel|  in the  |Argentine_Army|Argentine_Army| , and a colonel or  |group_captain|Group_Captain|  in other air forces of the world. The Argentine rank below commodore is the rank of vice-commodore  equivalent to a  |lieutenant-colonel|Lieutenant-Colonel|  in the Argentine Army, and a lieutenant-colonel or  |wing_commander|Wing_Commander|  in other air forces.     Commodore is a rank in the  |Royal_Netherlands_Air_Force|Royal_Netherlands_Air_Force| . It is a  |one-star_rank|One-Star_Rank|  and has essentially the same rank insignia as the British  |air_commodore|Air_Commodore| .     Many air forces use the rank of  |air_commodore|Air_Commodore| . This rank was first used by the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  and is now used in many countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Greece, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and Zimbabwe. It is the equivalent rank to the navy rank of commodore , and the army ranks of  |brigadier|Brigadier|  and  |brigadier_general|Brigadier_General| .     The German air force used the concept of a unit commodore for the commander of a wing, usually in the rank of colonel .          Commodore is also a title held by many captains as recognition of exceptional navigation ability and seagoing seniority in the Merchant Service, and by the directors of a few yacht clubs and boating associations. Commodores in command as Master aboard Merchant Marine ships wear distinctive rank and cap insignia denoting their honorific high rank position.         During wartime, a shipping  |convoy|Convoy|  will have a ranking officer—sometimes an active-duty naval  |officer|Commissioned_Officer| , at other times a  |civilian|Civilian| |master|Master_Mariner|  or retired naval officer—designated as the convoy commodore. This title is not related to the individuals military rank , but instead is the title of the senior individual responsible for the overall operation of the  |merchant_ships|Merchant_Ship|  and naval  |auxiliary_ships|Auxiliary_Ship|  that make up the convoy. The convoy commodore does not command the convoy escort forces , which are commanded by a naval officer who serves as escort commander.         The  |U.S._Coast_Guard_Auxiliary|U.S._Coast_Guard_Auxiliary|  also employs variants of the title of commodore. Members of the Auxiliary serve in the Coast Guards  |uniformed_auxiliary_service|Auxiliaries|  and they do not have military rank, but who do wear modified U.S. Coast Guard uniforms and U.S. military-style officer rank insignia to indicate office. Auxiliary members who have been elected or appointed to positions in the highest levels of the organization, similar in nature to active and reserve rear admirals and vice admirals use the term commodore . These Coast Guard Auxiliarists may permanently append the title commodore, sometimes abbreviated COMO, to their names .      In the  |Philippine_Coast_Guard_Auxiliary|Philippine_Coast_Guard_Auxiliary| —PCGA—each of the directors in command of the ten Coast Guard Auxiliary districts are commodores, as well as most of the Deputy National Directors . Commodore is abbreviated to COMMO in the PCGA.      |Vanderbilt_Universitys|Vanderbilt_University|  intercollegiate athletics teams are nicknamed the  |Commodores|Vanderbilt_Commodores|  , a reference to  |Cornelius_Vanderbilts|Cornelius_Vanderbilt|  self-appointed title .
