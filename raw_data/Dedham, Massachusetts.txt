     Dedham  is a  |town|New_England_Town|  in and the  |county_seat|County_Seat|  of  |Norfolk_County|Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts| ,  |Massachusetts|Massachusetts| ,  |United_States|United_States| . The population was 24,729 at the 2010 census. It is located on  |Bostons|Boston|  southwest border. On the northwest it is bordered by  |Needham|Needham,_Massachusetts| , on the southwest by  |Westwood|Westwood,_Massachusetts| , and on the southeast by  |Canton|Canton,_Massachusetts| . The town was first settled by European colonists in 1635.          Settled in 1635 by people from Roxbury and Watertown, Dedham was incorporated in 1636. It became the  |county_seat|County_Seat|  of  |Norfolk_County|Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts|  when the county was formed from parts of  |Suffolk_County|Suffolk_County,_Massachusetts|  on March 26, 1793. When the Town was originally incorporated, the residents wanted to name it Contentment.  The  |Massachusetts_General_Court|Massachusetts_General_Court|  overruled them and named the town after  |Dedham,_Essex|Dedham,_Essex|  in England, where some of the original inhabitants were born. The boundaries of the town at the time stretched to the Rhode Island border.     At the first public meeting on August 15, 1636, eighteen men signed the town covenant. They swore that they would in the fear and reverence of our Almighty God, mutually and severally promise amongst ourselves and each to profess and practice one truth according to that most perfect rule, the foundation whereof is ever lasting love.     They also agreed that we shall by all means labor to keep off from us all such as are contrary minded, and receive only such unto us as may be probably of one heart with us, as that we either know or may well and truly be informed to walk in a peaceable conversation with all meekness of spirit, for the edification of each other in the knowledge and faith of the Lord Jesusâ€¦ The covenant also stipulated that if differences were to arise between townsmen, they would seek arbitration for resolution and each would pay his fair share for the common good.     In November 1798,  |David_Brown|David_Brown|  led a group in Dedham protesting the federal government; they set up a  |liberty_pole|Liberty_Pole| , as people had before the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| . It carried the words, No  |Stamp_Act|Stamp_Act_1765| , No  |Sedition_Act|Alien_And_Sedition_Acts| , No  |Alien_Bills|Alien_And_Sedition_Acts| , No Land Tax, downfall to the Tyrants of America; peace and retirement to the President; Long Live the Vice President, referring to then-President  |John_Adams|John_Adams|  and Vice President  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| . Brown was arrested in  |Andover|Andover,_Massachusetts|  but because he could not afford the $4,000 bail, he was taken to  |Salem|Salem,_Massachusetts|  for trial. Brown was tried in June 1799. Although he wanted to plead guilty, Justice  |Samuel_Chase|Samuel_Chase|  urged him to name those who had helped him or subscribed to his writings in exchange for freedom. Brown refused, was fined $480, and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. It was the most severe sentence up to then imposed under the  |Alien_and_Sedition_Acts|Alien_And_Sedition_Acts| .     Dedham is home to the  |Fairbanks_House|Fairbanks_House| , the oldest surviving timber-frame house in the United States, scientifically dated to 1637. On January 1, 1643, by unanimous vote, Dedham authorized the first taxpayer-funded  |public_school|Public_School| , the seed of American education. Its first schoolmaster, Rev.  |Ralph_Wheelock|Ralph_Wheelock| , a  |Clare_College|Clare_College|  graduate, was paid 20  pounds annually to instruct the youth of the community. Descendants of these students would become presidents of  |Dartmouth_College|Dartmouth_College| ,  |Yale_University|Yale_University|  and  |Harvard_University|Harvard_University| .     The first man-made  |canal|Canal|  in North America,  |Mother_Brook|Mother_Brook| , was created in Dedham in 1639. It linked the  |Charles_River|Charles_River|  to the  |Neponset_River|Neponset_River| . Although both are slow-moving rivers, they are at different elevations. The difference in elevation made the canals current swift enough to power several local mills.     In 1818, though citizens were still taxed for the support of ministers and other public teachers of religion, Dedham set a precedent toward the  |separation_of_church_and_state|Separation_Of_Church_And_State_In_The_United_States| . Residents of the town selected a minister different than that chosen by the church members; the selection by residents was confirmed by the  |Supreme_Judicial_Court|Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court| . This decision increased support for the  |disestablishment|Disestablishmentarianism|  of the  |Congregational_churches|Congregationalism_In_The_United_States| .     The local  |Endicott_Estate|Endicott_Estate|  burned to the ground in 1904 after the local volunteer fire department, responding to three separate fires burning simultaneously, reached the Endicott fire last. By the time they arrived, only ashes remained. It is said that the estates owner, Henry Bradford Endicott  took the burning of the homestead as a divine command to rebuild . The rebuilt Endicott Estate is listed on the  |National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National_Register_Of_Historic_Places| . The estate and surrounding grounds are open to the public, upholding Henrys stepdaughter Katherines wish to use the house and property for educational, civic, social and recreational purposes.     In 1921, the historic  |Sacco_and_Vanzetti|Sacco_And_Vanzetti|  trial was held in the Norfolk County Courthouse in Dedham.  |Dedham_Pottery|Dedham_Pottery|  is a cherished class of antiques, characterized by a distinctive crackle glaze, blue-and-white color scheme, and a frequent motif of rabbits and other animals.

When the tree was finally felled, the gavel used by the  |Moderator|Moderator|  at  |Town_Meeting|Town_Meeting|  was carved out of it. Above the tree are the scales of justice, representing Dedham as the county seat and home to  |Norfolk_Countys|Norfolk_County,_Massachusetts|  courts. On the left of the tree are agricultural instruments, and on the right is a factory, showing Dedhams history first as a town of farmers and then as one with a number of mills and factories, particularly along  |Mother_Brook|Mother_Brook| . Below the tree is a banner with the word Contentment, the name of the original plantation.     The town flag is red with the seal prominent and in the center.

It hangs in the  |selectmens|Selectmen|  chambers at town hall and in the Great Hall of the  |Massachusetts_State_House|Massachusetts_State_House| .       A charter adopted in 1998 lays out the basic structure of the Town government, although it has been amended occasionally over the years. A seven-member Charter Advisory Committee, appointed in 2012, recommended six substantial changes and numerous minor changes be made to the document. The Selectmen consolidated them into six articles for Town Meetings consideration, and five were presented to the Meeting in 2013. Voters approved four of them in 2014. A version of the sixth and final proposal was adopted at the Spring 2014 Annual Town Meeting.       According to Dedhams , the administration of all the fiscal, prudential, and municipal affairs of the town, with the government thereof, shall be vested in a legislative branch, to consist of a  |representative_town_meeting|Representative_Town_Meeting| . Town Meeting is to consist of no less than 270 members, but not more than necessary to achieve an equal number coming from each precinct. There are currently seven districts, but could be as few as six or as many as nine, with lines drawn by the Board of Selectmen and the Registrars of Voters every ten years.     Votes are by voice unless members call for a standing or  |roll_call_vote|Roll_Call_Vote| , either of which can be called for by the Moderator. All Town officers are required to attend Town Meeting and multiple member bodies must send at least one representative who have all the privileges of a Member except the right to vote. If 5% of Town voters petition the Selectboard within 14 days of Town Meeting, any action taken may be submitted to voters.

Town Meeting sets its own rules and keeps a journal of proceedings. The Town Meeting may establish various ad-hoc and standing committees on which any Town Meeting Member or voter may serve.     Before each Spring Annual Town Meeting, the  |Public_Service_Recognition_Award|Public_Service_Recognition_Award|  is given to recognize citizens who have performed outstanding acts of service to the community.       Currently Town Meeting consists of 273 members, or representatives, with each of the seven districts, or precincts, electing 39. Thirteen are elected from each precinct each year and serve a three-year term. Each precinct elects from its own members a Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Secretary.

If no election is to take place within 120 days of the vacancy, then the district chairman is to call together the members of the district, and they are to elect a member who will serve until the next town election.       The Warrant at Town Meeting includes the articles to be voted on. Any elected or appointed board, committee, town officer, or any ten voters may place an article on the warrant.
