     Adoptionism, also called  |dynamic_monarchianism|Monarchianism| , is a  |Christian|Christianity| |_nontrinitarian|Nontrinitarian| |_theological_doctrine|Christian_Theology|  which holds that  |Jesus|Jesus_In_Christianity|  was adopted as the  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_God|  at his  |baptism|Baptism_Of_Jesus| , his  |resurrection|Resurrection_Of_Jesus| , or his  |ascension|Ascension_Of_Jesus| .       Adoptionism is one of two main forms of  |monarchianism|Monarchianism|  . Adoptionism denies the eternal  |pre_existence_of_Christ|Pre_Existence_Of_Christ| , and although it explicitly affirms his deity subsequent to events in his life, many classical  |trinitarians|Trinity|  claim that the doctrine implicitly denies it by denying the constant  |hypostatic_union|Hypostatic_Union|  of the eternal  |Logos|Logos|  to the human nature of Jesus. Justo L. González, Essential Theological Terms, page 139 .  Under adoptionism Jesus is currently divine and has been since his adoption, although he is not equal to the Father, per my Father is greater than I . Ed Hindson, Ergun Caner , The Popular Encyclopedia of Apologetics: Surveying the Evidence for the Truth of Christianity, page 16 .  and as such is a kind of  |subordinationism|Subordinationism| . Adoptionism is sometimes, but not always, related to  |denial_of_the_virgin_birth_of_Jesus|Denial_Of_The_Virgin_Birth_Of_Jesus| .                    The New Testament writings contain two different Christologies, namely a low or adoptionist Christology, and a high or incarnation Christology.  The low Christology or adoptionist Christology is the belief that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead,  thereby raising him to divine status.  The other early Christology is high Christology, which is the view that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being who became a human, did the Father’s will on earth, and then was taken back up into heaven whence he had originally come,  and from where he  |appeared_on_earth|Christophany| . The chronology of the development of these early Christologies is a matter of debate within contemporary scholarship. Larry Hurtado,      According to the evolutionary model  c.q. evolutionary theories,  as proposed by Bousset, followed by Brown, the Christological understanding of Christ developed over time, from a low Christology to a high Christology, Bart Ehrman, How Jesus became God, Course Guide as witnessed in the Gospels. According to the evolutionary model, the earliest Christians believed that Jesus was a human who was exalted, c.q. adopted as Gods Son, when he was resurrected, Geza Vermez , The Resurrection, p.138-139 signaling the nearness of the  |Kingdom_of_God|Kingdom_Of_God| , when all dead would be resurrected and the righteous exalted. Adoptionist concepts can be found in the  |Gospel_of_Mark|Gospel_Of_Mark| , in which the birth of Jesus and the epithet Son of God are absent in some early manuscripts, suggesting that the concept of the  |Virgin_Birth_of_Jesus|Virgin_Birth_Of_Jesus|  had not been developed or elucidated at the time Mark was written. Later beliefs shifted the exaltation to his baptism, birth, and subsequently to the idea of his eternal existence, as witnessed in the Gospel of John. Mark shifted the moment of when Jesus became the son to the  |baptism_of_Jesus|Baptism_Of_Jesus| , and later still Matthew and Luke shifted it to the moment of the  |divine_conception|Virgin_Birth_Of_Jesus| , and finally John declared that Jesus had been with God from the beginning: In the beginning was the Word .     Since the 1970s, the late datings for the development of a high Christology have been contested, and a majority of scholars argue that this High Christology existed already before the writings of Paul. This incarnation Christology or high Christology did not evolve over a longer time, but was a big bang of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul.  Larry Hurtado ,      According to Ehrman, these two Christologies existed alongside each other, calling the low Christology an adoptionist Christology, and the high Christology an incarnation Christology.        Adoptionist theology may also be reflected in canonical  |epistles|Epistle| , the earliest of which pre-date the writing of the gospels. The letters of  |Paul_the_Apostle|Paul_The_Apostle| , for example, do not mention a  |virgin_birth_of_Christ|Virgin_Birth_Of_Christ| . Paul describes Jesus as born of a woman, born under the  |law|Law_Of_Moses|  and as to his  |human_nature|Human_Nature|  was a descendant of David in the  |Epistle_to_the_Galatians|Epistle_To_The_Galatians|  and the  |Epistle_to_the_Romans|Epistle_To_The_Romans| . Many interpreters, however, take his statements in  |Philippians_2|Philippians_2|  to imply that Paul believed Jesus to have existed as equal to God before his  |incarnation|Incarnation| .      The  |Book_of_Hebrews|Book_Of_Hebrews| , a contemporary sermon by an unknown author,   describes God as saying You are my son; today I have begotten you.  The latter phrase, a quote of , could reflect an early Adoptionist view.       The 2nd-century work  |Shepherd_of_Hermas|Shepherd_Of_Hermas|  may also have taught that Jesus was a virtuous man filled with the Holy Spirit and adopted as the Son. Hermas never mentions Jesus Christ, or the Word, but only the Son of God, who is the highest angel. As holy spirit the Son dwells in the flesh; this human nature is Gods adopted son in, Patrick W. Carey, Joseph T. Lienhard , Biographical Dictionary of Christian Theologians, page 241 .   While the Shepherd of Hermas was popular and sometimes bound with the canonical scriptures, it didnt retain canonical status, if it ever had it.        |Theodotus_of_Byzantium|Theodotus_Of_Byzantium|  , a Valentinian Gnostic, was the most prominent exponent of adoptionsim. CARM,  According to  |Hippolytus_of_Rome|Hippolytus_Of_Rome|   Theodotus taught that Jesus was a man born of a virgin, according to the Council of Jerusalem, that he lived like other men, and was most pious. At his baptism in the Jordan the Christ came down upon the man Jesus, in the likeness of a dove , but Jesus was not himself  |God|God|  until after his  |resurrection|Resurrection| .       Adoptionism was declared  |heresy|Heresy_In_Christianity|  at the end of the 2nd century and was rejected by the  |Synods_of_Antioch|Synods_Of_Antioch|  and the  |First_Council_of_Nicaea|First_Council_Of_Nicaea| , which defined the  |orthodox_doctrine|Orthodoxy|  of the  |Trinity|Trinity|  and identified the man Jesus with the eternally begotten Son or  |Word_of_God|Logos|  in the  |Nicene_Creed|Nicene_Creed| .   The belief was also declared heretical by  |Pope_Victor_I|Pope_Victor_I| .            Adoptionism was also adhered to by the  |Jewish_Christians|Jewish_Christians|  known as  |Ebionites|Ebionites| , who, according to  |Epiphanius|Epiphanius_Of_Salamis|  in the 4th century, believed that Jesus was chosen on account of his  |sinless|Sinless|  devotion to the  |will_of_God|Will_Of_God| . Epiphanius of Salamis . pp. 30:3 & 30:13.     The Ebionites were a  |Jewish_Christian|Jewish_Christian|  movement that existed during the early centuries of the Christian Era.  They show strong similarities with the earliest form of Jewish Christianity, and their specific theology may have been a reaction to the  |law_free_Gentile_mission|Paul_And_Judaism| .  They regarded Jesus as the Messiah while rejecting his  |divinity|Divinity|  and his  |virgin_birth|Virgin_Birth_Of_Jesus| ,  and insisted on the necessity of following  |Jewish_law_and_rites|Halakha| .  They used the  |Gospel_of_the_Ebionites|Gospel_Of_The_Ebionites| , one of the  |Jewish–Christian_gospels|Jewish–Christian_Gospels| ; the Hebrew Book of Matthew starting at chapter 3; revered  |James_the_brother_of_Jesus|James_Brother_Of_Jesus|  ; and rejected  |Paul_the_Apostle|Paul_The_Apostle|  as an  |apostate_from_the_Law|Antinomianismsupporting_Pauline_Passages| . ,  Their name  suggests that they placed a special value on  |voluntary_poverty|Vow_Of_Poverty| .     Distinctive features of the Gospel of the Ebionites include the absence of the  |virgin_birth|Virgin_Birth_Of_Jesus|  and of the  |genealogy_of_Jesus|Genealogy_Of_Jesus| ; an  |Adoptionist|Adoptionist| |_Christology|Christology| , in which Jesus is chosen to be  |Gods_Son|Son_Of_God|  at the time of his  |Baptism|Baptism_Of_Jesus| ; the abolition of the  |Jewish_sacrifices|Korban|  by Jesus; and an advocacy of  |vegetarianism|Vegetarianism| .          Spanish Adoptionism was a theological position which was articulated in  |Umayyad|Caliphate_Of_Córdoba|  and  |Christian|Kingdom_Of_Asturias| -held regions of the  |Iberian_peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  in the 8th and 9th centuries. The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop  |Elipandus_of_Toledo|Elipandus_Of_Toledo|  that – in respect to his human nature – Christ was adoptive  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_God| . Another leading advocate of this Christology was  |Felix_of_Urgel|Felix_Of_Urgel| . In Spain, adoptionism was opposed by  |Beatus_of_Liebana|Beatus_Of_Liebana| , and in the  |Carolingian|Carolingian|  territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by  |Pope_Hadrian_I|Pope_Hadrian_I| ,  |Alcuin_of_York|Alcuin_Of_York| ,  |Agobard|Agobard| , and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt .     Despite the shared name of adoptionism the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term adoptivus of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son emptied himself of divinity and took the form of a servant , Christs human nature was adopted as divine. James Ginther, Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology, , 3.     Historically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of “ |Nestorian|Nestorianism| ” Christology. For an example of this characterization, see Adolph Harnack, ‘’History of Dogma’’, vol. 5, trans. Neil Buchanan, , 280. John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his study, The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785–820. John C. Cavadini, ‘’The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785–820’’, , 4–5.       A third wave was the revived form of  |Peter_Abelard|Peter_Abelard|  in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified Adoptionist tenets emerged from some theologians in the 14th century.  |Duns_Scotus|Duns_Scotus|  and  |Durandus_of_Saint_Pourçain|Durandus_Of_Saint_Pourçain|  admit the term Filius adoptivus in a qualified sense. In more recent times the Jesuit  |Gabriel_Vásquez|Gabriel_Vásquez| , and the Lutheran divines  |Georgius_Calixtus|Georgius_Calixtus|  and  |Johann_Ernst_Immanuel_Walch|Johann_Ernst_Immanuel_Walch| , have defended adoptionism as essentially orthodox.       A form of adoptionism surfaced in  |Unitarianism|Unitarianism|  during the 18th century as  |denial_of_the_virgin_birth|Denial_Of_The_Virgin_Birth_Of_Jesus|  became increasingly common, led by the views of  |Joseph_Priestley|Joseph_Priestley|  and others.     A similar form of adoptionism was expressed in the writings of  |James_Strang|James_Strang| , a  |Latter_Day_Saint|Latter_Day_Saint_Movement|  leader who founded the  |Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints_|Church_Of_Jesus_Christ_Of_Latter_Day_Saints|  after the  |death_of_Joseph_Smith|Death_Of_Joseph_Smith|  in 1844. In his  |Book_of_the_Law_of_the_Lord|Book_Of_The_Law_Of_The_Lord| , a purported work of ancient scripture found and translated by Strang, he offers an essay entitled Note on the Sacrifice of Christ in which he explains his unique doctrines on the subject. Jesus Christ, said Strang, was the natural-born son of  |Mary|Mary|  and  |Joseph|Saint_Joseph| , who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents  to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role. Book of the Law, pp. 157-58, note 9. Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence adopted as Gods son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the  |Transfiguration|Transfiguration_Of_Jesus| . Book of the Law, pp. 165-66. After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his  |resurrection|Resurrection_Appearances_Of_Jesus|  and  |ascension|Ascension_Of_Jesus_Christ| .
