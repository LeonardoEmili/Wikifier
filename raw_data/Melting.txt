        Melting, or  |fusion|Enthalpy_Of_Fusion| , is a physical process that results in the  |phase_transition|Phase_Transition|  of a  |substance|Chemical_Substance|  from a  |solid|Solid|  to a  |liquid|Liquid| . This occurs when the  |internal_energy|Internal_Energy|  of the solid increases, typically by the application of  |heat|Heat|  or  |pressure|Pressure| , which increases the substances  |temperature|Temperature|  to the  |melting_point|Melting_Point| . At the melting point, the ordering of  |ions|Ion|  or  |molecules|Molecule|  in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state, and the solid melts to become a liquid.     Substances in the molten state generally have reduced  |viscosity|Viscosity|  as the temperature increases. An exception to this principle is the element  |sulfur|Sulfur| , whose viscosity increases in the range of 160 °C to 180 °C due to  |polymerization|Polymerization| .      Some  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compound|  melt through  |mesophases|Mesophase| , states of partial order between solid and liquid.       From a thermodynamics point of view, at the melting point the change in  |Gibbs_free_energy|Gibbs_Free_Energy|  ∆G of the substances is zero, but there are non-zero changes in the  |enthalpy|Enthalpy|   and the  |entropy|Entropy|  , known respectively as the  |enthalpy_of_fusion|Enthalpy_Of_Fusion|   and the  |entropy_of_fusion|Entropy_Of_Fusion| . Melting is therefore classified as a  |first_order_phase_transition|Phase_Transitionmodern_Classifications| . Melting occurs when the Gibbs free energy of the liquid becomes lower than the solid for that material. The temperature at which this occurs is dependent on the ambient pressure.     Low-temperature  |helium|Helium|  is the only known exception to the general rule.   |Helium_3|Helium_3|  has a negative enthalpy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K.  |Helium_4|Helium_4|  also has a very slightly negative enthalpy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, heat must be removed from these substances in order to melt them.        Among the theoretical criteria for melting, the  |Lindemann|Frederick_Lindemann_1St_Viscount_Cherwell|   and  |Born|Max_Born|   criteria are those most frequently used as a basis to analyse the melting conditions . The Lindemann criterion states that melting occurs because of vibrational instability, e.g.  |crystals|Crystal|  melt when the average amplitude of thermal vibrations of atoms is relatively high compared with interatomic distances, e.g.  1/2  sub /sub sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  ref name Rice2008  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  sub /sub  ref  /ref math /math  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  .
