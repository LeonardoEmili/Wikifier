         Gallium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|   Ga and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|   31. Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery blue metal at  |standard_temperature_and_pressure|Standard_Conditions_For_Temperature_And_Pressure| ; however in its liquid state it becomes silvery white. If too much force is applied, the gallium may fracture  |conchoidally|Conchoidal_Fracture| . It is in  |group_13|Boron_Group|  of the periodic table, and thus has similarities to the other metals of the group,  |aluminium|Aluminium| ,  |indium|Indium| , and  |thallium|Thallium| . Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature, but as gallium compounds in trace amounts in  |zinc|Zinc|  ores and in  |bauxite|Bauxite| . Elemental gallium is a liquid at temperatures greater than , above  |room_temperature|Room_Temperature| , but below the normal human body temperature of . Hence, the metal will melt in a persons hands.     The melting point of gallium is used as a temperature reference point. Gallium alloys are used in thermometers as a non-toxic and  |environmentally_friendly|Environmentally_Friendly|  alternative to mercury, and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury. An even lower melting point of , well below the freezing point of water, is claimed for the alloy  |galinstan|Galinstan|  , but that may be the freezing point with the effect of  |supercooling|Supercooling| .     Since its discovery in 1875, gallium has been used to make  |alloys|Alloy|  with low melting points. It is also used in  |semiconductors|Semiconductor|  as a  |dopant|Dopant|  in semiconductor substrates.     Gallium is predominantly used in  |electronics|Electronics| .  |Gallium_arsenide|Gallium_Arsenide| , the primary  |chemical_compound|Chemical_Compound|  of gallium in electronics, is used in  |microwave|Microwave|  circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and  |infrared|Infrared|  circuits. Semiconducting  |gallium_nitride|Gallium_Nitride|  and  |indium_gallium_nitride|Indium_Gallium_Nitride|  produce blue and violet  |light-emitting_diodes|Light-Emitting_Diode|  and  |diode_lasers|Diode_Laser| . Gallium is also used in the production of artificial  |gadolinium_gallium_garnet|Gadolinium_Gallium_Garnet|  for jewelry. Gallium is considered a  |technology-critical_element|Technology-Critical_Element| .     Gallium has no known natural role in biology. Gallium behaves in a similar manner to  |ferric|Ferricferric_Iron_And_Life|  salts in biological systems and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and  |radiopharmaceuticals|Radiopharmacology| .          Elemental gallium is not found in nature, but it is easily obtained by  |smelting|Smelting| . Very pure gallium is a silvery blue metal that fractures  |conchoidally|Conchoidal_Fracture|  like  |glass|Glass| . Gallium liquid expands by 3.10% when it solidifies; therefore, it should not be stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the gallium changes state. Gallium shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes  |water|Properties_Of_Water| ,  |silicon|Silicon| ,  |germanium|Germanium| ,  |antimony|Antimony| ,  |bismuth|Bismuth| , and  |plutonium|Plutonium| . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 222     Gallium  |attacks|Liquid_Metal_Embrittlement|  most other metals by  |diffusing|Diffusion|  into the metal  |lattice|Crystal_Structure| . For example, it diffuses into the  |grain_boundaries|Grain_Boundary|  of  |aluminium|Aluminium| - |zinc|Zinc| |alloys|Alloy|   and  |steel|Steel| ,  making them very brittle. Gallium easily alloys with many metals, and is used in small quantities in the  |plutonium-gallium_alloy|Plutonium-Gallium_Alloy|  in the plutonium  |cores|Plutonium_Pit|  of  |nuclear_bombs|Nuclear_Weapon|  to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.      The  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  of gallium, at 302.9146  K , is just above room temperature, and is approximately the same as the average summer daytime temperatures in Earths mid-latitudes. This melting point is one of the formal temperature reference points in the  |International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990|International_Temperature_Scale_Of_1990|  established by the  |International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures|International_Bureau_Of_Weights_And_Measures|  .    The  |triple_point|Triple_Point|  of gallium, 302.9166  K , is used by the US  |National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology|National_Institute_Of_Standards_And_Technology|  in preference to the melting point.      The melting point of gallium allows it to melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong tendency to  |supercool|Supercooling|  below its  |melting_point|Melting_Point| / |freezing_point|Freezing_Point| |Seeding|Seed_Crystal|  with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium is one of the four non-radioactive metals  that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium is the only one that is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature  |thermometers|Thermometer| . It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having a low  |vapor_pressure|Vapor_Pressure|  at high temperatures. Galliums boiling point, 2673  K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the  |absolute_scale|Absolute_Scale| , the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 224 Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal  |wets|Wetting|  glass and skin, along with most other materials , making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 221 For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.          Gallium does not  |crystal|Crystal| lize in any of the simple  |crystal_structures|Crystal_Structure| . The stable phase under normal conditions is  |orthorhombic|Orthorhombic|  with 8 atoms in the conventional  |unit_cell|Unit_Cell| . Within a unit cell, each atom has only one nearest neighbor . The remaining six unit cell neighbors are spaced 27, 30 and 39  pm farther away, and they are grouped in pairs with the same distance.  Many stable and  |metastable|Metastability_In_Molecules|  phases are found as function of temperature and pressure.      The bonding between the two nearest neighbors is  |covalent|Covalent| ; hence Ga 2  |dimers|Dimer|  are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the crystal. This explains the low melting point relative to the neighbor elements, aluminium and indium. This structure is strikingly similar to that of  |iodine|Iodine|  and forms because of interactions between the single 4p electrons of gallium atoms, further away from the nucleus than the 4s electrons and the d 10 core. This phenomenon recurs with  |mercury|Mercury|  with its pseudo-noble-gas f 14 5d 10 6s 2 electron configuration, which is liquid at room temperature. Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 223 The 3d 10 electrons do not shield the outer electrons very well from the nucleus and hence the first ionisation energy of gallium is greater than that of aluminium.     The physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along the three major crystallographical axes a, b, and c , producing a significant difference between the linear and volume  |thermal_expansion|Thermal_Expansion|  coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting.           Gallium has 31 known isotopes, ranging in  |mass_number|Mass_Number|  from 56 to 86. Only two isotopes are stable and occur naturally, gallium-69 and gallium-71. Gallium-69 is more abundant: it makes up about 60.1% of natural gallium, while gallium-71 makes up the remaining 39.9%. All the other isotopes are radioactive, with gallium-67 being the longest-lived . Isotopes lighter than gallium-69 usually decay through  |beta_plus_decay|Beta_Plus_Decay|  or  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture|  to isotopes of  |zinc|Zinc| , although the lightest few decay through prompt  |proton_emission|Proton_Emission| . Isotopes heavier than gallium-71 decay through  |beta_minus_decay|Beta_Minus_Decay|  , possibly with delayed  |neutron_emission|Neutron_Emission| , to isotopes of  |germanium|Germanium| , while gallium-70 can decay through both beta minus decay and electron capture. Gallium-67 is unique among the light isotopes in having only electron capture as a decay mode, as its decay energy is not sufficient to allow positron emission.  Gallium-67 and  |gallium-68|Gallium-68|  are both used in nuclear medicine.          Gallium is found primarily in the +3  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State| . The +1 oxidation state is also found in some compounds, although it is less common than it is for galliums heavier congeners indium and thallium. For example, the very stable GaCl 2 contains both gallium and gallium and can be formulated as Ga I Ga III Cl 4 ; in contrast, the monochloride is unstable above 0  °C,  |disproportionating|Disproportionation|  into elemental gallium and gallium chloride. Compounds containing Ga–Ga bonds are true gallium compounds, such as  |GaS|Gallium_Sulfide|  and the  |dioxan|Dioxan|  complex Ga 2 Cl 4 2 . Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 240       Strong acids dissolve gallium, forming gallium salts such as  and  .  |Aqueous|Aqueous|  solutions of gallium salts contain the hydrated gallium ion, .    |Gallium_hydroxide|Gallium_Hydroxide| , , may be precipitated from gallium solutions by adding  |ammonia|Ammonia| . Dehydrating  at 100  °C produces gallium oxide hydroxide, GaO.       Alkaline  |hydroxide|Hydroxide|  solutions dissolve gallium, forming gallate salts  containing the  anion.  Gallium hydroxide, which is  |amphoteric|Amphoteric| , also dissolves in alkali to form gallate salts.  Although earlier work suggested  as another possible gallate anion,  it was not found in later work.        Gallium reacts with the  |chalcogens|Chalcogen|  only at relatively high temperatures. At room temperature, gallium metal is not reactive with air and water because it forms a  |passive|Passivation| , protective  |oxide|Oxide|  layer. At higher temperatures, however, it reacts with atmospheric  |oxygen|Oxygen|  to form  |gallium_oxide|Gallium_Oxide| , .  Reducing  with elemental gallium in vacuum at 500  °C to 700  °C yields the dark brown  |gallium_oxide|Gallium_Oxide| , .   is a very strong  |reducing_agent|Reducing_Agent| , capable of reducing  to .  It disproportionates at 800  °C back to gallium and .       |Gallium_sulfide|Gallium_Sulfide| , , has 3 possible crystal modifications.  It can be made by the reaction of gallium with  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|   at 950  °C.  Alternatively,  can be used at 747  °C:    :2  + 3  →  + 6      Reacting a mixture of alkali metal carbonates and  with  leads to the formation of thiogallates containing the  anion. Strong acids decompose these salts, releasing  in the process.  The mercury salt, , can be used as a  |phosphor|Phosphor| .      Gallium also forms sulfides in lower oxidation states, such as  |gallium_sulfide|Gallium_Sulfide|  and the green  |gallium_sulfide|Gallium_Sulfide| , the latter of which is produced from the former by heating to 1000  °C under a stream of nitrogen.      The other binary chalcogenides,  and , have the  |zincblende|Zincblende|  structure. They are all semiconductors but are easily  |hydrolysed|Hydrolysis|  and have limited utility.           Gallium reacts with ammonia at 1050  °C to form  |gallium_nitride|Gallium_Nitride| , GaN. Gallium also forms binary compounds with  |phosphorus|Phosphorus| ,  |arsenic|Arsenic| , and  |antimony|Antimony| |gallium_phosphide|Gallium_Phosphide|  ,  |gallium_arsenide|Gallium_Arsenide|  , and  |gallium_antimonide|Gallium_Antimonide|  . These compounds have the same structure as  |ZnS|Zinc_Sulfide| , and have important  |semiconducting|Semiconductor|  properties.  GaP, GaAs, and GaSb can be synthesized by the direct reaction of gallium with elemental phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony.  They exhibit higher electrical conductivity than GaN.  GaP can also be synthesized by reacting  with phosphorus at low temperatures.      Gallium forms ternary  |nitrides|Nitride| ; for example:    : +  →      Similar compounds with phosphorus and arsenic are possible:  and . These compounds are easily hydrolyzed by dilute  |acids|Acid|  and water.           Gallium oxide reacts with  |fluorinating_agents|Halogenation|  such as  |HF|Hydrogen_Fluoride|  or  to form  |gallium_fluoride|Gallium_Fluoride| , . It is an ionic compound strongly insoluble in water. However, it dissolves in  |hydrofluoric_acid|Hydrofluoric_Acid| , in which it forms an  |adduct|Adduct|  with water, . Attempting to dehydrate this adduct forms . The adduct reacts with ammonia to form , which can then be heated to form anhydrous .       |Gallium_trichloride|Gallium_Trichloride|  is formed by the reaction of gallium metal with  |chlorine|Chlorine|  gas. Unlike the trifluoride, gallium chloride exists as dimeric molecules, , with a melting point of 78  °C. Eqivalent compounds are formed with bromine and iodine,  and .      Like the other group 13 trihalides, gallium halides are  |Lewis_acids|Lewis_Acid| , reacting as halide acceptors with alkali metal halides to form salts containing  anions, where X is a halogen. They also react with  |alkyl_halides|Haloalkane|  to form  |carbocations|Carbocation|  and .      When heated to a high temperature, gallium halides react with elemental gallium to form the respective gallium halides. For example,  reacts with Ga to form   3 GaCl     At lower temperatures, the equilibrium shifts toward the left and GaCl disproportionates back to elemental gallium and . GaCl can also be produced by reacting Ga with HCl at 950  °C; the product can be condensed as a red solid.      Gallium compounds can be stabilized by forming adducts with Lewis acids. For example:   :GaCl +  →      The so-called gallium halides , , are actually adducts of gallium halides with the respective gallium halides, having the structure . For example:     :GaCl +  →        Like  |aluminium|Aluminium| , gallium also forms a  |hydride|Hydride| , , known as  gallane , which may be produced by reacting lithium gallanate  with  |gallium_chloride|Gallium_Chloride|  at −30  °C:    :3  +  → 3 LiCl + 4      In the presence of  |dimethyl_ether|Dimethyl_Ether|  as solvent,  polymerizes to . If no solvent is used, the dimer   is formed as a gas. Its structure is similar to  |diborane|Diborane| , having two hydrogen atoms bridging the two gallium centers,  unlike α- in which aluminium has a coordination number of 6.      Gallane is unstable above −10  °C, decomposing to elemental gallium and  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| .           Organogallium compounds are of similar reactivity to organoindium compounds, less reactive than organoaluminium compounds, but more reactive than organothallium compounds. Greenwoood and Earnshaw, pp. 262–5 Alkylgalliums are monomeric.  |Lewis_acid|Lewis_Acid| ity decreases in the order Al .
