He studied  |ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicology|  there with the intention of becoming a researcher in the field, due to his interest in various  |world_music|World_Music|  traditions, particularly the  |Japanese|Music_Of_Japan|  ,  |Indian|Music_Of_India|  and  |African_musical|Music_Of_Africa|  traditions.

One of Sakamotos classical influences was  |Claude_Debussy|Claude_Debussy| , who he described as his hero and stated that “ |Asian_music|Music_Of_Asia|  heavily influenced Debussy, and Debussy heavily influenced me. So, the music goes around the world and comes full circle.”      In 1975, Sakamoto collaborated with percussionist Tsuchitori Toshiyuki to release Disappointment-Hateruma.  After working as a session musician with  |Haruomi_Hosono|Haruomi_Hosono|  and  |Yukihiro_Takahashi|Yukihiro_Takahashi|  in 1977,  the trio formed the internationally successful  |electronic_music|Electronic_Music|  band  |Yellow_Magic_Orchestra|Yellow_Magic_Orchestra|  in 1978.

Sakamoto released his first solo album  Thousand Knives of Ryūichi Sakamoto  in mid-1978 with the help of  |Hideki_Matsutake|Hideki_Matsutake| —Hosono also contributed to the song Thousand Knives . The album experimented with different styles, such as Thousand Knives and The End of Asia —in which electronic music was  |fused|Fusion|  with traditional  |Japanese_music|Music_Of_Japan| —while Grasshoppers is a more  |minimalistic|Minimalistic_Music|  piano song. The album was recorded from April to July 1978 with a variety of  |electronic_musical_instruments|Electronic_Musical_Instrument| , including various synthesizers, such as the  |KORG_PS-3100|Korg_Ps-3300| , a  |polyphonic_synthesizer|Polyphonic_Synthesizer| ; the  |Oberheim_Eight-Voice|Oberheim_Polyphonic| ; the  |Moog_III-C|Moog_Synthesizer| ; the  |Polymoog|Polymoog| , the  |Minimoog|Minimoog| ; the  |Micromoog|Micromoog| ; the  |Korg_VC-10|Korg_Vc-10| , which is a vocoder; the  |KORG_SQ-10|Korg_Ms-20| , which is an  |analog_sequencer|Analog_Sequencer| ; the  |Syn-Drums|Pollard_Syndrum| , an  |electronic_drum|Electronic_Drum|  kit; and the  |microprocessor|Microprocessor| -based  |Roland_MC-8_Microcomposer|Roland_Mc-8_Microcomposer| , which is a  |music_sequencer|Music_Sequencer|  that was programmed by Matsutake and played by Sakamoto.   A version of the song Thousand Knives was released on the Yellow Magic Orchestras 1981 album  BGM .  This version was one of the earliest uses of the  |Roland_TR-808|Roland_Tr-808| |drum_machine|Drum_Machine| , for YMOs live performance of 1000 Knives in 1980 and their BGM album release in 1981.            In 1980, Sakamoto released the solo album B-2 Unit, which has been referred to as his edgiest record and is known for the electronic song Riot in Lagos ,  which is considered an early example of  |electro_music|Electro_Music|  ,  as Sakamoto anticipated the beats and sounds of electro.  Early electro and hip hop artists, such as  |Afrika_Bambaata|Afrika_Bambaata|  and  |Kurtis_Mantronik|Kurtis_Mantronik| , were influenced by the album—especially Riot in Lagos —with Mantronik citing the work as a major influence on his electro hip hop group  |Mantronix|Mantronix| .  Riot in Lagos was later included in  |Playgroups|Playgroup| |compilation_album|Compilation_Album|  Kings of Electro , alongside other significant electro compositions, such as  |Hashims|Hashim_Music|  Al-Naafyish .      According to Dusted Magazine, Sakamotos use of squelching  |bounce|Bounce_Music|  sounds and mechanical  |beats|Beat|  was later incorporated in early electro and  |hip_hop_music|Hip_Hop_Music|  productions, such as “ |Message_II|The_Message| ” , by  |Melle_Mel|Melle_Mel|  and  |Duke_Bootee|Duke_Bootee| ; “ |Magic’s_Wand|Whodini| ” , by  |Whodini|Whodini|  and  |Thomas_Dolby|Thomas_Dolby| ; Twilight 22s “Electric Kingdom” ; and Kurt Mantroniks  Mantronix: The Album  .  The 1980 release of Riot in Lagos was listed by  The Guardian  in 2011 as one of the 50 key events in the history of  |dance_music|Dance_Music| .      Among other tracks on B-2 Unit, Differencia has, according to  Fact , relentless tumbling beats and a stabbing  |bass_synth|Bass_Synth|  that foreshadows  |jungle|Oldschool_Jungle|  by nearly a decade . Some tracks on the album also foreshadow genres such as  |IDM|Intelligent_Dance_Music| ,  |broken_beat|Broken_Beat| , and  |industrial_techno|Industrial_Techno| , and the work of producers such as  |Actress|Actress|  and  |Oneohtrix_Point_Never|Oneohtrix_Point_Never| . For several tracks on the album, Sakamoto worked with UK  |reggae|Reggae|  producer  |Dennis_Bovell|Dennis_Bovell| , incorporating elements of  |afrobeat|Afrobeat|  and  |dub_music|Dub_Music| . ,  Fact      Also in 1980, Sakamoto released the single War Head/Lexington Queen , an experimental  |synthpop|Synthpop|  and electro record,  and began a long-standing collaboration with  |David_Sylvian|David_Sylvian| , when he co-wrote and performed on the  |Japan|Japan|  track Taking Islands In Africa . In the following year, Sakamoto collaborated with  |Talking_Heads|Talking_Heads|  and  |King_Crimson|King_Crimson|  guitarist  |Adrian_Belew|Adrian_Belew|  and  |Robin_Scott|Robin_Scott|  for an album titled Left-Handed Dream. Following Japans dissolution, Sakamoto worked on another collaboration with Sylvian, a single entitled  |Bamboo_Houses/Bamboo_Music|Bamboo_Houses|  in 1982. Sakamotos 1980 collaboration with  |Kiyoshiro_Imawano|Kiyoshiro_Imawano| , Ikenai Rouge Magic , topped the  |Oricon|Oricon|  singles chart.       In 1983, Sakamoto starred alongside  |David_Bowie|David_Bowie|  in director  |Nagisa_Oshimas|Nagisa_Oshima|   Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence . In addition to acting in the film, Sakamoto also composed the films musical score and again collaborated with Sylvian on the films main theme  – which became a minor hit. In a 2016 interview, Sakamoto reflected on his time acting in the film, claiming that he hung out with Bowie every evening for a month while filming on location. He remembered Bowie as straightforward and nice , while also lamenting the fact that he never mustered the courage to ask for Bowies help while scoring the films soundtrack as he believed Bowie was too concentrated on acting .      Sakamoto released a number of solo albums during the 1980s. While primarily focused on the piano and synthesizer, this series of albums included collaborations with artists such as Sylvian,  |David_Byrne|David_Byrne| ,  |Thomas_Dolby|Thomas_Dolby| ,  |Nam_June_Paik|Nam_June_Paik|  and  |Iggy_Pop|Iggy_Pop| . Sakamoto would alternate between exploring a variety of musical styles, ideas and genres—captured most notably in his 1983 album Illustrated Musical Encyclopedia —and focusing on a specific subject or theme, such as the Italian  |Futurism|Futurism|  movement .     As his solo career began to extend outside Japan in the late 1980s, Sakamotos explorations, influences and collaborators also developed further.  Beauty  features a track list that combines pop with traditional Japanese and  |Okinawan_songs|Okinawan_Music| , as well as guest appearances by  |Jill_Jones|Jill_Jones| ,  |Robert_Wyatt|Robert_Wyatt| ,  |Brian_Wilson|Brian_Wilson|  and  |Robbie_Robertson|Robbie_Robertson| .

In 1995 Sakamoto released Smoochy, described by the Sound On Sound website as Sakamotos excursion into the land of easy-listening and Latin , followed by the  1996  album, which featured a number of previously released pieces arranged for solo piano, violin and cello.  During December 1996 Sakamoto, composed the entirety of an hour-long orchestral work entitled Untitled 01 and released as the album Discord . The  |Sony_Classical|Sony_Classical|  release of Discord was sold in a  |jewel_case|Jewel_Casejewel_Case|  that was covered by a blue-colored  |slipcase|Slipcase|  made of  |foil|Metal_Leaf| , while the CD also contained a data video track. In 1998 the  |Ninja_Tune|Ninja_Tune|  record label released the Prayer/Salvation Remixes, for which prominent electronica artists such as Ashley Beedle and Andrea Parker remixed sections from the Prayer and Salvation parts of Discord.  Sakamoto collaborated primarily with guitarist David Torn and  |DJ_Spooky|Dj_Spooky| —artist  |Laurie_Anderson|Laurie_Anderson|  provides spoken word on the composition—and the recording was condensed from nine live performances of the work, recorded during a Japanese tour. Discord was divided into four parts: Grief , Anger , Prayer and Salvation ; Sakamoto explained in 1998 that he was not religious, but maybe spiritual and The Prayer is to anybody or anything you want to name. Sakamoto further explained:          In 1998, Italian ethnomusicologist  |Massimo_Milano|Massimo_Milano|  published  Ryuichi Sakamoto. Conversazioni  through the Padova, Arcana imprint. All three editions of the book were published in the  |Italian_language|Italian_Language| .  Sakamotos next album,  BTTB  —an  |acronym|Acronym|  for Back to the Basics —was a fairly opaque reaction to the prior years multilayered, lushly orchestrated Discord. The album comprised a series of original pieces on solo piano, including Energy Flow and a frenetic, four-hand arrangement of the Yellow Magic Orchestra classic Tong Poo . On the BTTB U.S. tour, he opened the show performing a brief  |avant-garde|Avant-Garde| |DJ|Turntablism|  set under the stage name DJ Lovegroove.

This debut, released on German label  |Raster-Noton|Raster-Noton| , was voted record of the year 2004 in the electronica category by British magazine  The Wire . They then released  Insen  —while produced in a similar manner to Vrioon, this album is somewhat more restrained and minimalist. They keep on collaborating and have released two more albums:  utp   and  Summvs  .      In 2005,  |Finnish|Finland|  mobile phone manufacturer  |Nokia|Nokia|  hired Sakamoto to compose ring and alert tones for their high-end phone, the  |Nokia_8800|Nokia_8800| .

Of his experience recording with Sakamoto, Frame said:                 Sakamoto began working in films, as a composer and actor, in  |Nagisa_Oshimas|Nagisa_Oshima|   Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence  , for which he composed the score,  |title_theme|Merry_Christmas_Mr._Lawrence| , and the duet  |Forbidden_Colours|Forbidden_Colours|  with  |David_Sylvian|David_Sylvian| .
