     In  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics| , every type of  |particle|Particle|  has an associated antiparticle with the same  |mass|Mass|  but with opposite  |physical_charges|Charge|  . For example, the antiparticle of the  |electron|Electron|  is the  |antielectron|Antielectron|  . While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| . The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron.     Some particles, such as the  |photon|Photon| , are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as normal matter , and the other as  antimatter .     Particle–antiparticle pairs can  |annihilate|Particle_Annihilation|  each other, producing  |photons|Photon| ; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Ray| , a process exploited in  |positron_emission_tomography|Positron_Emission_Tomography| .     The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an  |antiproton|Antiproton|  and a  |positron|Positron|  can form an  |antihydrogen|Antihydrogen| |atom|Atom| , which is believed to have the same properties as a  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  atom. This leads to the question of why the  |formation_of_matter_after_the_Big_Bang|Baryogenesis|  resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and  |antimatter|Antimatter| . The discovery of  |Charge_Parity_violation|Cp_Violation|  helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.     Because  |charge|Charge|  is  |conserved|Charge_Conservation| , it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge , or by the simultaneous creation of both a particle and its antiparticle, which can occur in  |particle_accelerators|Particle_Accelerator|  such as the  |Large_Hadron_Collider|Large_Hadron_Collider|  at  |CERN|Cern| .     Although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of  |quarks|Quark| , the  |antineutron|Antineutron|  from  |antiquarks|Quarkantiquarks| , and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as  |photons|Photon| ,  |Z_0_bosons|W_And_Z_Bosonsz_Boson| ,    |mesons|Meson| , and hypothetical  |gravitons|Graviton|  and some hypothetical  |WIMPs|Weakly_Interacting_Massive_Particle| .             In 1932, soon after the prediction of  |positrons|Positron|  by  |Paul_Dirac|Paul_Dirac| ,  |Carl_D._Anderson|Carl_D._Anderson|  found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a  |cloud_chamber|Cloud_Chamber| — a  |particle_detector|Particle_Detector|  in which moving  |electrons|Electron|  leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a  |magnetic_field|Magnetic_Field| . Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction. Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.     The  |antiproton|Antiproton|  and  |antineutron|Antineutron|  were found by  |Emilio_Segrè|Emilio_Segrè|  and  |Owen_Chamberlain|Owen_Chamberlain|  in 1955 at the  |University_of_California,_Berkeley|University_Of_California,_Berkeley| . Since then, the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments. In recent years, complete atoms of  |antimatter|Antimatter|  have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.           Solutions of the  |Dirac_equation|Dirac_Equation|  contained negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a sea of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower-energy states so that, due to the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| , no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative-energy particles could be lifted out of this  |Dirac_sea|Dirac_Sea|  to become a positive-energy particle. But, when lifted out, it would leave behind a  hole  in the sea that would act exactly like a positive-energy electron with a reversed charge. These holes were interpreted as negative-energy electrons by Paul Dirac and by mistake he identified them with  |protons|Proton|  in his 1930 paper A Theory of Electrons and Protons    However, these negative-energy electrons turned out to be  |positrons|Positron| , and not  |protons|Proton| .     This picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe—a problem of which Dirac was aware. Dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until  |Hermann_Weyl|Hermann_Weyl|  proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction   +    →    +  , where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons.  |Robert_Oppenheimer|Robert_Oppenheimer|  and  |Igor_Tamm|Igor_Tamm|  proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron, a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.     Within Diracs theory, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains. Some  |bosons|Bosons|  also have antiparticles, but since bosons do not obey the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle|  , hole theory does not work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory| , which solves both these problems by describing antimatter as negative energy states of the same underlying matter field i.e. particles moving backwards in time.                If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states, then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles. Reactions such as   +    →    +   are an example. The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair,   +    →  , cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and  |momentum|Momentum|  together in this process. However, in the Coulomb field of a nucleus the  |translational_invariance|Translational_Invariance|  is broken and single-photon annihilation may occur.    The reverse reaction is also impossible for this reason. In quantum field theory, this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the  |uncertainty_principle|Uncertainty_Principle| . This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may fluctuate into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the  |vacuum_state|Vacuum_State|  and  |renormalization|Renormalization|  of a quantum field theory. It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here, which is a complicated example of  |mass_renormalization|Mass_Renormalization| .          |Quantum_states|Quantum_State|  of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the  |charge_conjugation|C-Symmetry|  ,  |parity|P-Symmetry|  , and  |time_reversal|T-Symmetry|  operators. If  p,  ,n   denotes the quantum state of a particle with momentum p, spin J whose component in the z-direction is σ, then one has   :: CPT    p,         p,-    ,   where n c denotes the charge conjugate state, that is, the antiparticle. This behaviour under  |CPT_symmetry|Cpt_Symmetry|  is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same  |irreducible_representation|Irreducible_Representation|  of the  |Poincaré_group|Poincaré_Group| . Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then   :: T   p,         -p,-  ,   :: CP   p,         -p,  ,   :: C   p,         p,  ,   where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have   the same mass m   the same spin state J   opposite  |electric_charges|Electric_Charge|  q and -q.       :This section draws upon the ideas, language and notation of canonical quantization of a quantum field theory .     One may try to quantize an electron  |field|Field|  without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing     ::     ak e,      where we use the symbol k to denote the quantum numbers p and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy, E, and a k  denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with  |fermions|Fermion| , we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the  |Hamiltonian|Hamiltonian|      :: H  E a  ak,      then one sees immediately that the expectation value of H need not be positive. This is because E can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.     So one has to introduce the charge conjugate antiparticle field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations     :: b a    b      where k has the same p, and opposite σ and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form     ::   uk ak e+  uk b  k e,      where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes     :: H  Ek a  k ak +    E b  bk + E0,      where E 0  is an infinite negative constant. The  |vacuum_state|Vacuum_State|  is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, i.e., ak  0  and bk  0  . Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly E 0 . Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, H is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of a k  and b k  shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a  |fermion|Fermion| .     This approach is due to  |Vladimir_Fock|Vladimir_Fock| ,  |Wendell_Furry|Wendell_Furry|  and  |Robert_Oppenheimer|Robert_Oppenheimer| . If one quantizes a real  |scalar_field|Scalar_Field_Theory| , then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore, real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.      |Feynman–Stueckelberg_interpretation|Feynman–Stueckelberg_Interpretation| ,  |Feynman-Stueckelberg_interpretation|Feynman-Stueckelberg_Interpretation| ,  |Stueckelberg–Feynman_interpretation|Stueckelberg–Feynman_Interpretation| ,  |Stueckelberg-Feynman_interpretation|Stueckelberg-Feynman_Interpretation| ,  |Feynman–Stückelberg_interpretation|Feynman–Stückelberg_Interpretation| ,  |Feynman-Stückelberg_interpretation|Feynman-Stückelberg_Interpretation| ,  |Stückelberg–Feynman_interpretation|Stückelberg–Feynman_Interpretation| , and  |Stückelberg-Feynman_interpretation|Stückelberg-Feynman_Interpretation|  redirect here--  ref  /ref ref  /ref .
