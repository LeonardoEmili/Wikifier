Transport in Pakistan  is extensive and varied, and serves a population of over 191 million people. In recent years, new  |national_highways|National_Highways_Of_Pakistan|  have been built, with the addition of  |motorways|Motorways_Of_Pakistan|  which have improved trade and logistics within the country. Pakistans rail network owned by  |Pakistan_Railways|Pakistan_Railways|  is also undergoing expansion in recent years.  |Airports|Airports_Of_Pakistan|  and  |seaports|Seaports|  have been built with the addition of foreign and domestic funding.          The history of transport in modern-day Pakistan dates back to the  |Indus_Valley_Civilization|Indus_Valley_Civilisation| .     The  |Grand_Trunk_Road|Grand_Trunk_Road|  was a major road commissioned by  |Sher_Shah_Suri|Sher_Shah_Suri|  in the 16th century and used during the  |Suri|Sur_Empire|  and  |Mughal|Mughal_Empire|  periods. Trees were planted, and mosques and temples built along the road.  |Caravanserais|Caravanserai|  were built for travelers to spend the night.     Railways and Airways were developed during the  |British_Raj|British_Raj| . The first railways in Pakistan were built from 1885.                 The construction of motorways began in the early 1990s, with the idea of building a world-class road network and reducing the load on the heavily used national highways throughout the country. The  |M2|M2_Motorway|  was the first motorway completed in 1998, linking the cities of  |Islamabad|Islamabad|  and  |Lahore|Lahore| . In the past 5 years, many new motorways have opened up, including the  |M1|M1_Motorway|  and  |M4|M4_Motorway| . The  |M4|M4_Motorway|  is partially operational while half is under construction, and connects the cities of Pindi Bhatian , Faislabad and Multan via  |Gojra|Gojra| ,  |Toba_Tek_Singh|Toba_Tek_Singh| ,  |Jhang|Jhang| ,  |Shorkot|Shorkot| ,  |Pir_Mahal|Pir_Mahal|  and  |Khanewal|Khanewal| . The M3, which will connect Lahore with Multan through Abdul Hakeem and the existing M4 near  |Multan|Multan| , is under construction; it will terminate at the under-construction M5, which will lead to the Sukkhur District of Sindh. There, the M6 will start; the M6 will end at  |Hyderabad|Hyderabad| , where it will meet the existing M9 motorway to  |Karachi|Karachi| . In addition to this, the M8 in  |Baluchistan|Baluchistan|  province, the longest motorway of Pakistan, is half under construction, half operational. In central Punjab, the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway is under construction and will be operational by next year, and in KPK province, the Hakka-Dera Ismail Khan Motorway is also under construction. Swat Motorway and Hazara Motorway are two more expressways under construction in KPK province.   Total: 263,775  km   Paved: 152,033  km   Unpaved: 105,650  km   Vehicles on road: 4.2 million vehicles 250,000 commercial vehicles             During the 1990s, Pakistan began an ongoing project to rebuild all  |national_highways|National_Highways_Of_Pakistan|  throughout the country specifically to important financial, cargo and textile centers. The  |National_Highway_Authority|National_Highway_Authority|  or NHA is responsible for the maintenance of all national highways in Pakistan.   The  |Makran_Coastal_Highway|Makran_Coastal_Highway|  follows the coast of Sindh and Balochistan provinces, linking Karachi and Gwadar. Journey time has been reduced to six or seven hours with the construction of the new Coastal Highway. The highway was built as part of an overall plan to improve transport facilities in southern Balochistan.   The  |Karakoram_Highway|Karakoram_Highway|  is the highest paved international road in the world. It connects China and Pakistan across the Karakoram mountain range, through the Khunjerab Pass.   The  |Grand_Trunk_Road|Grand_Trunk_Road|  is one of South Asias oldest and longest major roads. For several centuries, it has linked the eastern and western regions of the  |South_Asia|South_Asia| , running from Bengal, across north India, into Peshawar in Pakistan.   The  |Silk_Road|Silk_Road|  is an extensive interconnected network of trade routes across the Asian continent connecting East, South, and Western Asia with the Mediterranean world, including North Africa and Europe. It passes through the midsection of Pakistan through cities: Peshawar,  |Taxila|Taxila|  and Multan.        |Provincial_Highways_of_Azad_Kashmir|Provincial_Highways_Of_Azad_Kashmir| |_Provincial_Highways_of_Balochistan|Provincial_Highways_Of_Balochistan| |_Provincial_Highways_of_Gilgit_Baltistan|Provincial_Highways_Of_Gilgit_Baltistan| |_Provincial_Highways_of_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa|Provincial_Highways_Of_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa| |_Provincial_Highways_of_Punjab|Provincial_Highways_Of_Punjab| |_Provincial_Highways_of_Sindh|Provincial_Highways_Of_Sindh|             Within cities, buses provide a significant role in commuting a large number of travellers from one city to another. Recently, large CNG buses have been put onto the streets of various cities, primarily  |Karachi|Karachi|  and  |Lahore|Lahore| , and recently  |Islamabad|Islamabad| , as the minivans which were originally used were beginning to cause large traffic problems. Private yellow and white minivans have services throughout cities in Pakistan and get commuters from one point of the city to the other at a low cost. Since 2000, however, the government has taken a comprehensive initiative to modernize the existing bus fleets and minimally impact the environment. This public-private enterprise would gradually introduce 8,000 CNG buses throughout the country and 800 buses in Karachi. This venture will ensure high standards of efficiency and cleanliness.      Inter city     Bus service in urban areas and between cities is well established with services run by both public and private sectors. Bus services like  |Daewoo_Express|Daewoo_Express| , Faisal Movers, Bilal Travels, Niazi Express, Skyways, Baloch Transport,Q Connect, Falcon Lines, Road Master, Islamabad Express, Bahawalpur Express, Waraich Buses,,Kohistan and NEW Khan Brothers have set up a modern intercity service which connects to most cities in Pakistan and runs 24 hours a day. Intercity buses tend to be more modern and well kept.     International   International bus services are also well established in Pakistan and connect to various countries:     |Quetta|Quetta| - |Zahidan|Zahidan| , Iran    |Quetta|Quetta| - |Mashad|Mashad| , Iran    |Gwadar|Gwadar| - |Zahidan|Zahidan| , Iran    |Karachi|Karachi| - |Quetta|Quetta| - |Zahidan|Zahidan| - |Tehran|Tehran| , Iran    |Peshawar|Peshawar| - |Jalalabad|Jalalabad| , Afghanistan    |Peshawar|Peshawar| - |Kabul|Kabul| , Afghanistan    |Islamabad|Islamabad| - |Dushanbe|Dushanbe| , Tajikistan    |Islamabad|Islamabad| - |Kashghar|Kashghar| , China    |Gilgit|Gilgit| - |Kashgar|Kashgar|  see  |Karakoram_Highway|Karakoram_Highwaybus_Service_Between_Gilgit_And_Kashgar| |_Lahore|Lahore| - |Delhi|Delhi| , India    |Muzaffarabad|Muzaffarabad| - |Srinagar|Srinagar| , India     Bus rapid transit    ; Without segregated lanes   The  |TransLahore|Lahore_Transport_Company|  is a bus rapid transit system in  |Lahore|Lahore| . The  |Lahore_Transport_Company|Lahore_Transport_Company|  was established in 1984 to ease the traffic conditions of Lahore and improve bus services. The Company was assigned responsibility for transport in Lahore in December 2001. A BRT fleet of 650 buses was introduced. It was named  |TransLahore|Lahore_Transport_Company| . However, the bus rapid transit system did not have dedicated lanes and had to share roads with regular traffic with no right of way. This resulted in a system that was a BRTS only in name.     ; With segregated lanes    |Lahore|Lahore| |Metrobus_|Metrobus|  Bus Service was inaugurated on Feb 10, 2013 by  |CM_Punjab_Shehbaz_Sharif|Shehbaz_Sharif| .  It consist of 27-kilometres long road track for the Metro Bus Service, from Gajumata to Shahadra, out of this track 8.5  km is elevated. It has 27 bus stations and e-ticketing and  |intelligent_transportation_system|Intelligent_Transportation_System|  are part of the MBS.    |Islamabad|Islamabad| - |Rawalpindi|Rawalpindi| |Rawalpindi_Islamabad_Metrobus_Service|Rawalpindi_Islamabad_Metrobus_Service|  is an operational bus rapid transit system which connects key areas in city of  |Rawalpindi|Rawalpindi|  and the national capital city of  |Islamabad|Islamabad| . It is  long, and has 24 stations. The project was inaugurated on 4 June 2015 by Prime Minister  |Nawaz_Sharif|Nawaz_Sharif| .     |Multan_Metrobus|Multan_Metrobus|  is an operational bus rapid transit in the city of  |Multan|Multan| . The  long BRT system connects the main commercial areas of the city.     ; Planned    |Karachi_Metrobus|Karachi_Metrobus|  is planned for city of Karachi. It will consist of 5 corridors and will have total length of about , of which the Green and Red Linea are about to go into a construction phase.   The corridors include:   :: Surjani Town to Jama Cloth Market   :: Model Colony to Regal Chowk   :: Landhi to Luck Star Hotel   :: Baldia to Shershah via Hub River Road   :: Hwaksbay to Gulbai via Mauripur   :: Orangi to Board Office .    |TransPeshawar|Transpeshawar|  is a bus rapid transit system for the city of Peshawar. The project is under the consideration of PTI led Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. PMTS will be a bus rapid transit system which will be initially constructed on one red line having length of 18.4 kilometer from Chamkani to Hayatabad area of Peshawar.    |Faisalabad|Faisalabad| |Lahore_Bus_Rapid_Transit_System|Lahore_Bus_Rapid_Transit_System| . Metro line will connect  |Faisalabad_International_Airport|Faisalabad_International_Airport|  to City Bus Terminal, passing through main hubs of the city. Construction is expected to start at the end of 2015.            Another very common form of transport, seen mainly at hotels and airports, are yellow taxis. Drivers charge according to a meter located on the dashboard of the car, but fares can be negotiated if there is no meter. The cab drivers are reliable and will take passengers to any destination required.     There are also numerous privately run services that use cars and minibuses of various types throughout Pakistan, providing a reliable and quick means of transport. Recently, the Radio Cab was introduced in Pakistan, which allows riders to call a toll-free number to get in touch with the closest taxi stand. This service is currently offered in  |Islamabad|Islamabad| ,  |Rawalpindi|Rawalpindi| ,  |Karachi|Karachi| ,  |Peshawar|Peshawar|  and  |Lahore|Lahore| . Services for  |Hyderabad|Hyderabad_Sindh|  and  |Faisalabad|Faisalabad|  are now being set up. Another local cab service was introduced in August, 2017 with the name iCAB, claiming to be the first cab service of the country with a centralized platform for all kinds of road transportation services, providing app-based services and getting stupendous response from the people of Pakistan. Launched from the capital territory, iCAB will expand its operations to overall 13 cities of the country.       Over the years, the number of cars on Pakistani roads has tripled. Traffic jams are a common scene in major cities across Pakistan. The most popular cars on Pakistani roads are the  |Suzuki_Mehran|Suzuki_Mehran| ,  |Suzuki_Cultus|Suzuki_Cultus| ,  |Suzuki_Alto|Suzuki_Alto| ,  |Suzuki_Bolan|Suzuki_Carry| ,  |Daihatsu_Coure|Daihatsu_Mira| ,  |Hyundai_Santro|Hyundai_Santro| ,  |Honda_Civic|Honda_Civic| ,  |Honda_City|Honda_City| ,  |Honda_Accord|Honda_Accord| ,  |Toyota_Corolla|Toyota_Corolla| ,  |Daihatsu_Mira|Daihatsu_Mira| ,  |Nissan_Dayz|Nissan_Dayz| , and  |Toyota_Vitz|Toyota_Vitz| .     Luxury SUVs and cars are owned by the elite in urban cities and by many large landowners in the villages and rural areas, thus making them a fairly common sight in Pakistan. The most popular models are the  |Toyota_Land_Cruiser|Toyota_Land_Cruiser| ,  |Toyota_Prado|Toyota_Prado| ,  |Land_Rover_Range_Rover|Range_Rover| , along with several  |Mercedes_Benz|Mercedes_Benz| es,  |BMWs|Bmw|  and  |Audis_|Audi|      ;Future cars   To meet future needs, students and teachers from the  |National_University_of_Science_and_Technology|National_University_Of_Sciences_And_Technology_Pakistan|  developed Pakistans first ever hybrid gasoline car, the  |Devrim_II|Devrim_Ii| , inspired by the  |Turkish|Turkey|  model Devrim.  Before that, students from  |Naval_College_Karachi|Naval_College_Karachi|  and  |Ghulam_Ishaq_Khan_Institute|Ghulam_Ishaq_Khan_Institute|  also made a successful hybrid car, but  |Devrim_II|Devrim_Ii|  is the most effective one. The current team leader of the Pak-Wheelers said,              |Auto_rickshaws|Auto_Rickshaws|  are a popular method of travelling in cities and are found in almost every city and town in Pakistan. The fare is usually negotiable before commencing a journey; however, due to the level of pollution contributed by auto-rickshaws, the government has recently begun banning older ones and replacing them with CNG auto rickshaws, which tend to be less noisy, form less pollutants and are much bigger and more comfortable. The Punjab government decided in 2005 to replace two-stroke three-wheelers with  |CNG|Compressed_Natural_Gas| -fitted four-stroke rickshaws in Lahore,  |Multan|Multan| ,  |Faisalabad|Faisalabad| ,  |Rawalpindi|Rawalpindi|  and  |Gujranwala|Gujranwala| . Three manufacturers were ordered to produce 60,000 four-stroke vehicles, but they reportedly supplied 2,000 to the government which are now plying on city roads. Similar ordinances are now being considered in other provinces of Pakistan.     A new form of transport in Pakistan is the Qing-Qi , which is a cross between a motorcycle and auto-rickshaw. It runs just like a motorcycle but has three wheels instead of two and can carry a much heavier load. It is an urban transport vehicle and is used mostly for short distances.       Motorcycling is another means of transportation in Pakistan. It is considered to be the most quickest way of getting to areas where vehicles cannot reach. There are also motorcycling operators in the cities. Some of them make use of helmet while others dont. There are also companies such as  |Bykea|Bykea|  that offer ride-hailing services with bikes or motorcycles in  |Karachi|Karachi| ,  |Lahore|Lahore| ,  |Rawalpindi|Rawalpindi|  and others.  Ride-hailing services such as  |Uber|Uber|  and  |Careem|Careem|  are also available.                       Rail services in Pakistan are provided by the state-run  |Pakistan_Railways|Pakistan_Railways| , under the supervision of the Ministry of Railways. Pakistan Railways provides an important mode of transportation in Pakistan, catering to the large-scale movement of people and freight. The railway network comprises 8,163  km  all of which is  gauge, including 293  km of electrified track. Passenger earnings comprise 50% of the total revenue. During 1999–2000 this amounted to Rs. 4.8 billion. Pakistan Railways carry 65 million passengers annually and daily operate 228 mail, express and passenger trains. Pakistan Railways also operate special trains for various occasions. The Freight Business Unit with 12,000 personnel operates over 200 freight stations on the railway network. The FBU serves the  |Port_of_Karachi|Port_Of_Karachi|  and  |Port_Qasim|Port_Qasim|  as well as in various other stations along the network and generates revenue from the movement of agricultural, industrial and imported products such as wheat, coal, fertiliser, cement and sugar. About 39% of the revenue is generated from the transportation of petroleum, 19% from imported wheat, fertiliser and rock phosphate. The remaining 42% is earned from domestic traffic. The freight rate structure is based on market trends in road transport, which is the main competitor to rail transport.       Prime Minister  |Nawaz_Sharif|Nawaz_Sharif|  said that a high-speed rail network will be built which will connect  |Peshawar|Peshawar|  to  |Karachi|Karachi|  via all major cities of  |Pakistan|Pakistan|  during his visit to  |China|China|  in June 2016. The Government is making plans for this project.         Commuter rail    The  |Karachi_Circular_Railway|Karachi_Circular_Railway| , which opened in the early 1940s, is the only functioning Mass Transit System in Pakistan. In 1976, Karachi was slated to begin work on an underground metro system, but plans have been put on hold since. The  |Lahore_Metro_Bus_System|Lahore_Metro_Bus_System|  is another rapid mass transit system which was tested by the Chief Minister of Punjab  |Shahbaz_Sharif|Shahbaz_Sharif|  on December 25, 2012. It began operation on February 11, 2013.  |Lahore_Metro|Lahore_Metro|  would be the first mass transit system of it type in  |Pakistan|Pakistan| .  |Peshawar_Metro|Peshawar_Metro|  is also planned.   On 22 May 2014,   |Pakistan|Pakistan|  and  |China|China|  signed a $1.6 billion agreement for a metro train project in  |Lahore|Lahore| .  The Government decided to build the Orange Line of  |Lahore_Metro|Lahore_Metro| . Work on the project will start in 2014 and will be completed within 27 months. The total length of the project will be 27.1  km, of which 25.4  km will be elevated and 1.7  km underground.     In  |Lahore|Lahore| ,  |Lahore_Central_Railway_Station|Lahore_Railway_Station|  is the main railway station.  |Shahdara_Bagh|Shahdara_Bagh| , Badami Bagh,  |Mughalpura|Mughalpura| , Shahdara Town,  |Lahore_Cantonment|Lahore_Cantonment| ,  |Wagah|Wagah| ,  |Walton_Cantonment|Walton_Cantonment| ,  |Kot_Lakhpat|Kot_Lakhpat| ,  |Kahna_Nau|Kahna_Nau| , Jia Bagga and  |Raiwind|Raiwind|  are other busy railway stations located in  |Lahore|Lahore| . These urban railway stations of the city are served by commuter trains of Lahore. A large number of commuters use these station to get access to the city of Lahore.      Monorail    The government of Pakistan has planned to build a monorail system in its federal capital,  |Islamabad|Islamabad| . A monorail is also planned for New Avenue in  |Gulberg_Lahore|Gulberg_Lahore|  Metro rail   The  Lahore Metro  or Lahore Rapid Mass Transit System   is a  |rapid_transit|Rapid_Transit|  metro system under construction in  |Lahore|Lahore| , the second largest city of  |Pakistan|Pakistan| . First proposed in 1991, funding was not secured, and in 2012 it was abandoned by the Punjab government in favour of the more cost–effective  |Lahore_Metro_Bus_System|Lahore_Metro_Bus_System|  which opened in February 2013. However, the Punjab Government decided to restart development on the Lahore Metro as a $1.6 billion project with Chinese assistance. The  |Orange_Line|Orange_Line| , which will be  long, ,  will be the first line of the project and is under construction.          |India|Rail_Transport_In_India|  -    |Thar_Express|Thar_Express|  to  |Karachi|Karachi|  and the more famous  |Samjhauta_Express|Samjhauta_Express|  international train from Lahore, Pakistan to Amritsar and Delhi, India. The weekly  |Thar_Express|Thar_Express|  also runs between  |Karachi|Karachi|  and  |Bhagat_Ki_Kothi|Bhagat_Ki_Kothi|  .       |Iran|Transportation_In_Iran|  -   A  railway line runs from  |Zahedan|Zahedan|  to  |Quetta|Quetta| , and a  line is finished from  |Zahedan|Zahedan|  to  |Kerman|Kerman|  in central Iran, linking with the rest of the Iranian rail network. On May 18, 2007, a MOU for rail cooperation was signed by Pakistan and Iran under which the line will be completed by December 2008. Now that the rail systems are linked up at Zahedan, there is a  |break_of_gauge|Break_Of_Gauge|  between the  |Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Railways|Islamic_Republic_Of_Iran_Railways|   tracks and Pakistan Railways Indian gauge tracks.  |Railway_Gazette_International|Railway_Gazette_International| |_Afghanistan|Transportation_In_Afghanistan|  -   Currently there is no rail link to  |Afghanistan|Transport_In_Afghanistan|  since no railway network is present in that country, however Pakistan Rail has proposed to help build an Afghan Rail Network in three phases. The first phase will stretch from the  |Chaman|Chaman|  to  |Spin_Boldak|Spin_Boldak|  in Afghanistan. The second phase will extend line to  |Kandahar|Kandahar|  and the third phase will eventually connect to  |Herat|Herat| . From there, the line will be extended to  |Khushka|Serhetabat| ,  |Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan| . The final phase would link  with Central Asian . It is not clear where the  |break_of_gauge|Break_Of_Gauge|  station will be.  The proposed line will also be connected the port town of  |Gwadar|Gwadar|  via  |Dalbadin|Dalbadin|  and  |Taftan|Taftan_Balochistan| , thus connecting the port town to Central Asia.       |China|Transportation_In_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  -   There is no link with  |China|Transport_In_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  however, on 28 February 2007 contracts were awarded for feasibility studies on a proposed line from  |Havelian|Havelian|  via the  |Khunjerab_Pass|Khunjerab_Pass|  at 4730  m above sea level, to the Chinese  |railhead|Railhead|  at  |Kashgar|Kashgar| , a distance of about 750  km.        |Turkmenistan|Transportation_In_Turkmenistan|  -   Via Afghanistan – avoiding  intervening.        |Turkey|Transportation_In_Turkey|  -   An  |Istanbul|Istanbul| - |Tehran|Tehran| - |Islamabad|Islamabad|  passenger rail service was proposed recently.  Meanwhile, a  |container_train|Container_Train|  service was launched by the former Prime Minister of Pakistan  |Yousuf_Raza_Gilani|Yousuf_Raza_Gilani|  between Islamabad and  |Istanbul|Istanbul|  on 14 August 2009. The first train carried 20  |containers|Intermodal_Container|  with a capacity of around     and will travel  from Islamabad, through  |Tehran|Tehran| ,  |Iran|Iran|  and on to Istanbul in two weeks time.  According to the  |Minister_for_Railways|Ministry_Of_Railways| |_Ghulam_Ahmad_Bilour|Ghulam_Ahmad_Bilour| , after the trial of the container train service, a passenger train will be launched.  There are also hopes the route will eventually provide a link to  |Europe|Europe|  and  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| , and carry passengers.        In  |Ghangha_Pur|Ghangha_Pur| , a   |narrow_gauge|Narrow_Gauge_Railway| |_horse_drawn_tramway|Horsecar|  is operational.  It was first opened in 1898, closed in 1998, and re-opened in 2010.                   Pakistan has  |151_airports|List_Of_Airports_In_Pakistan| .

There are 91 airports with paved runways, of which 14 have runways longer than 3,047 meters. The remaining 48 airports have unpaved runways including one airport with a runway longer than 3,047 meters. Pakistan also has eighteen  |heliports|Heliport| .            The waterway network in Pakistan is in its infancy, with  |Karachi|Karachi|  being the only major city situated next to the Arabian Sea. Still, plans are being proposed for the development of the waterways in the country along the  |Indus_River|Indus_River|  and through the Punjab as it would boost employment opportunities and the economic and social development of Pakistan.   See a list of  |dry_ports|List_Of_Dry_Ports_In_Pakistan|  and  |sea_ports|List_Of_Ports_And_Harbours_Of_The_Indian_Ocean|  in Pakistan.    |Port_of_Gwadar|Gwadar|  – Gwadar, Balochistan    |Port_of_Karachi|Port_Of_Karachi|  – Karachi , Sindh   :  |Karachi_International_Container_Terminal|Karachi_International_Container_Terminal|    :  |Pakistan_International_Container_Terminal|Pakistan_International_Container_Terminal| |_Port_Qasim|Port_Qasim|  – East Karachi, Sindh    |Port_of_Pasni|Pasni_City|  – Pasni, Balochistan       Ferry services run between Kimari and Minora Island in  |Karachi|Karachi| .    |Karachi|Karachi|  used to have a ferry connection with City of  |Mumbai|Mumbai|  in  |India|India|  until the 1960s, but it was later discontinued when both the countries went into war.   A cruise service called Gulf Dream Cruise began between  |Karachi|Karachi|  and  |Dubai|Dubai|  in 2006, but it wasnt able to go beyond its first sailing due to visa issues imposed by the  |UAE|United_Arab_Emirates|  authorities.       Length of  |pipelines|Pipeline_Transport|  for crude oil is .   Length of  |Petroleum|Petroleum|  products pipeline is .   Length of  |Natural_gas|Natural_Gas|  pipelines is .     The above information was calculated in 2009.       The  |China_Pakistan_Economic_Corridor|China_Pakistan_Economic_Corridor|  is an under-construction development program to connect  |Gwadar_Port|Gwadar_Port|  in southern Pakistan to Chinas northwestern autonomous region of  |Xinjiang|Xinjiang|  via  |highways|Highways| ,  |railways|Railway|    and pipelines to transport oil and gas. Chinese Premier  |Li_Keqiang|Li_Keqiang|  was among the first advocates of the project; since then Chinese President  |Xi_Jinping|Xi_Jinping| , formar Pakistani President  |Asif_Ali_Zardari|Asif_Ali_Zardari|  and Pakistani prime minister  |Nawaz_Sharif|Nawaz_Sharif|  have become strong supporters of the project.  When the corridor is constructed, it will serve as a primary gateway for trade between China and the Middle East and Africa; in particular, oil from the  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  could be offloaded at Gwadar, which is located just outside the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and transported to China through the  |Baluchistan|Baluchistan|  province in Pakistan. Such a link would vastly shorten the 12,000-kilometre route that Mideast oil supplies must now take to reach Chinese ports.      The project received a major boost when control of  |Gwadar|Gwadar|  was transferred to Chinas state-owned China Overseas Ports Holding in February 2013. Built by Chinese workers and opened in 2007, Gwadar is undergoing a major expansion to turn it into a full-fledged, deep-water commercial port. On 19 February 2014, the  South China Morning Post  reported that Pakistan and China have signed agreements for constructing an international airport at Gwadar, for upgrading a section of the 1,300-kilometre Karakorum Highway connecting to Islamabad, and for a fibre-optic cable to be laid from the Chinese border to the Pakistani city of  |Rawalpindi|Rawalpindi| .     According to  The Diplomat , with the development of the corridor,  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| , traditionally an economically closed region owing to its geography and lack of infrastructure, will have greater access to the sea and to the global trade network.  Pak-China Economic Corridor Secretariat was inaugurated in  |Islamabad|Islamabad|  on August 27, 2013.
