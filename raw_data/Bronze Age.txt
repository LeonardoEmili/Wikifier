      The Bronze Age is a historical  |period|Periodization|  characterized by the use of  |bronze|Bronze| , and in some areas  |proto_writing|Proto_Writing| , and other early features of urban  |civilization|Civilization| . The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the  |three_age_Stone_Bronze_Iron_system|Three_Age_Stone_Bronze_Iron_System| , as proposed in modern times by  |Christian_Jürgensen_Thomsen|Christian_Jürgensen_Thomsen| , for classifying and studying ancient societies.     An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing  |bronze|Bronze|  by  |smelting|Smelting|  its own  |copper|Copper|  and alloying with  |tin|Tin| ,  |arsenic|Arsenic| , or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time, allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage.     Whilst terrestrial  |iron|Iron|  is naturally abundant, its high melting point of  placed it out of reach of common use until the end of the second millennium BC.

Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the  |Neolithic|Neolithic|  period, with the  |Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic|  serving as a transition. Although the  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  generally followed the Bronze Age, in some areas , the Iron Age began as early as 2500 BC. . Portal.unesco.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.     Bronze Age cultures differed in their  |development_of_the_first_writing|Development_Of_The_First_Writing| . According to archaeological evidence, cultures in  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|   and  |Egypt|Egypt|   developed the earliest viable writing systems.          The overall period is characterized by widespread use of bronze, though the place and time of the introduction and development of bronze technology were not universally synchronous. Bronze was independently discovered in the  |Maykop_culture|Maykop_Culture|  of the  |North_Caucasus|North_Caucasus|  as early as the mid- |4th_millennium_BC|4Th_Millennium_Bc| , which makes them the producers of the oldest known bronze. However, the Maykop culture only had  |arsenical_bronze|Arsenical_Bronze| . Other regions developed bronze and its associated technology at different periods. Human-made tin bronze technology requires set production techniques. Tin must be mined  and smelted separately, then added to molten copper to make bronze alloy. The Bronze Age was a time of extensive use of metals and of developing trade networks . A 2013 report suggests that the earliest tin-alloy bronze dates to the mid-5th millennium BC in a  |Vinča_culture|Vinča_Culture|  site in  |Pločnik|Pločnik|  , although this culture is not conventionally considered part of the Bronze Age.  The dating of the foil has been disputed.                Western Asia and the Near East was the first region to enter the Bronze Age, which began with the rise of the  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| n civilization of  |Sumer|Sumer|  in the mid 4th millennium BC. Cultures in the ancient Near East  practiced intensive year-round agriculture, developed a writing system, invented the  |potters_wheel|Potters_Wheel| , created a centralized government, written law codes, city and nation states and empires, embarked on advanced architectural projects, introduced  |social_stratification|Social_Stratification| , economic and civil administration,  |slavery|Slavery| , and practiced organized warfare, medicine and religion.

Quote: First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero , the somewhat misleading term Sea Peoples encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset . Footnote: The modern term Sea Peoples refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from islands . The use of quotation marks in association with the term Sea Peoples in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation of the sea appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill . Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.  Quote: The thesis that a great migration of the Sea Peoples occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about the sea peoples, one Egyptologist recently remarked that although some things are unclear, eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer Volkerwanderung zu tun. Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation. the kingdom disintegrated into several independent Neo-Hittite city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BC.      |Arzawa|Arzawa|  in Western Anatolia during the second half of the  |second_millennium_BC|Second_Millennium_Bc|  likely extended along southern Anatolia in a belt that reaches from near the  |Turkish_Lakes_Region|Turkish_Lakes_Region|  to the  |Aegean|Aegean_Sea|  coast.  |Arzawa|Arzawa|  was the western neighbor  – sometimes a rival and sometimes a vassal  – of the  |Middle_and_New_Hittite_Kingdoms|Hittite_Kingdom| .     The  |Assuwa_league|Assuwa_League|  was a confederation of states in western Anatolia that was defeated by the Hittites under an earlier  |Tudhaliya_I|Tudhaliya_I| , around 1400 BC. Arzawa has been associated with the much more obscure  |Assuwa|Assuwa|  generally located to its north. It probably bordered it, and may even be an alternative term for it .

It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from  |Abydos|Abydos_Egypt|  to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period.  |Memphis|Memphis_Egypt|  in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time.

Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when the rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases:  |Heracleopolis|Herakleopolis_Magna|  in Lower Egypt and  |Thebes|Thebes_Egypt|  in Upper Egypt. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict, with the Theban kings conquering the north, resulting in the reunification of Egypt under a single ruler during the second part of the 11th Dynasty.      |Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt|Middle_Kingdom_Of_Egypt|  lasted from 2055 to 1650 BC. During this period, the  |Osiris_funerary_cult|Ancient_Egyptian_Religion|  rose to dominate Egyptian popular religion.

During the  |Second_Intermediate_Period|Second_Intermediate_Period| , Bruce G. Trigger. Ancient Egypt: a social history. 1983. p. 137. Ancient Egypt fell into disarray for a second time, between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known for the  |Hyksos|Hyksos| , whose reign comprised the 15th and 16th dynasties. The Hyksos first appeared in Egypt during the 11th Dynasty, began their climb to power in the 13th Dynasty, and emerged from the Second Intermediate Period in control of  |Avaris|Avaris|  and the  |Delta|Nile_Delta| . By the 15th Dynasty, they ruled lower Egypt, and they were expelled at the end of the 17th Dynasty.      |New_Kingdom_of_Egypt|New_Kingdom_Of_Egypt| , also referred to as the Egyptian Empire, lasted from the 16th to the 11th century BC. The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was succeeded by the  |Third_Intermediate_Period|Third_Intermediate_Period| . It was Egypts most prosperous time and marked the peak of Egypts power. The later New Kingdom, i.e. the 19th and 20th Dynasties , is also known as the  |Ramesside_period|Ramesside_Period| , after the eleven pharaohs that took the name of Ramesses.              |Elam|Elam|  was a pre-Iranic ancient civilization located to the east of Mesopotamia. In the Old Elamite period , Elam consisted of kingdoms on the  |Iranian_Plateau|Iranian_Plateau| , centered in  |Anshan|Anshan| , and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in  |Susa|Susa|  in the  |Khuzestan|Khuzestan|  lowlands.

The earliest known  |Ugarit|Ugarit|  contact with Egypt comes from a  |carnelian|Carnelian|  bead identified with the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret I, 1971–1926 BC. A  |stela|Stela|  and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found. However, it is unclear at what time these monuments got to Ugarit. In the  |Amarna_letters|Amarna_Letters| , messages from Ugarit  BC written by Ammittamru I, Niqmaddu II, and his queen, were discovered. From the 16th to the 13th century BC, Ugarit remained in constant touch with Egypt and Cyprus .     The  |Mitanni|Mitanni|  was a loosely organized state in northern Syria and south-east Anatolia from –1300 BC. Founded by an Indo-Aryan ruling class that governed a predominantly Hurrian population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of Kassite Babylon created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia. At its beginning, Mitannis major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, it had outposts centered on its capital,  |Washukanni|Washukanni| , which archaeologists have located on the headwaters of the Khabur River. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite, and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire.

The  |Arameans|Arameans|  were a Northwest Semitic semi-nomadic and pastoralist people who originated in what is now modern Syria during the Late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. Large groups migrated to Mesopotamia, where they intermingled with the native Akkadian population. The Aramaeans never had a unified empire; they were divided into independent kingdoms all across the Near East. After the Bronze Age collapse, their political influence was confined to a number of Syro-Hittite states, which were entirely absorbed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the 8th century BC.          The  |Mesopotamian_Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age_Mesopotamia|  began about 3500 BC and ended with the  |Kassite|Kassites|  period . The usual tripartite division into an Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age is not used. Instead, a division primarily based on art-historical and historical characteristics is more common.

The  |Akkadian_Empire|Akkadian_Empire|  became the dominant power in the region, and after its fall the Sumerians enjoyed a renaissance with the  |Neo_Sumerian_Empire|Neo_Sumerian_Empire| .  |Assyria|Assyria|  was extant from as early as the 25th century BC, and became a regional power with the  |Old_Assyrian_Empire|Old_Assyrian_Empire|  . The earliest mention of  |Babylon|Babylon|  appears on a tablet from the reign of  |Sargon_of_Akkad|Sargon_Of_Akkad|  in the 23rd century BC. The  |Amorite|Amorite|  dynasty established the  |city_state|City_State|  of Babylon in the 19th century BC. Over 100 years later, it briefly took over the other city-states and formed the short lived First  |Babylonia|Babylonia| n Empire during what is also called the  |Old_Babylonian_Period|First_Babylonian_Dynasty| . Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia all used the written  |East_Semitic|East_Semitic_Languages| |_Akkadian_language|Akkadian_Language|  for official use and as a spoken language. By that time, the Sumerian language was no longer spoken, but was still in religious use in Assyria and Babylonia, and would remain so until the 1st century AD. The  |Akkadian|Akkadian_Empire|  and  |Sumer|Sumer| ian traditions played a major role in later Assyrian and Babylonian culture, even though Babylonia itself was founded by non-native  |Amorites|Amorites|  and often ruled by other non-indigenous peoples, such as  |Kassites|Kassites| ,  |Arameans|Arameans|  and  |Chaldea|Chaldea| ns, as well as its Assyrian neighbours.

It is conjectured that changes in climate in this region around 2000 BC and the ensuing ecological, economic and political changes triggered a rapid and massive migration westward into northeast Europe, eastward into China and southward into  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  and  |Thailand|Thailand|     across a frontier of some 4,000 miles. This migration took place in just five to six generations and led to peoples from Finland in the west to Thailand in the east employing the same metal working technology and, in some areas, horse breeding and riding. It is further conjectured that the same migrations spread the  |Uralic|Uralic_Languages|  group of languages across Europe and Asia: some 39 languages of this group are still extant, including  |Hungarian|Hungarian_Language| ,  |Finnish|Finnish_Language|  and  |Estonian|Estonian_Language| .   However, recent genetic testings of sites in south Siberia and  |Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan|   would rather support a spreading of the bronze technology via  |Indo_European_migrations|Indo_European_Migrations|  eastwards, as this technology was well known for quite a while in western regions.                    In China, the earliest bronze artifacts have been found in the  |Majiayao_culture|Majiayao_Culture|  site .       The term Bronze Age has been transferred to the archaeology of China from that of Western Eurasia, and there is no consensus or universally used convention delimiting the Bronze Age in the context of Chinese prehistory. The archaeological term Bronze Age was first introduced for Europe in the 1830s and soon extended to the Near East. By the 1860s, there was some debate as to whether the term should be extended to China .     By convention, the Early Bronze Age in China is sometimes taken as equivalent to the  |Shang_dynasty|Shang_Dynasty|  period of Chinese prehistory , Robert L. Thorp, China in the Early Bronze Age: Shang Civilization, University of Pennsylvania Press . and the Later Bronze Age as equivalent to the  |Zhou_dynasty|Zhou_Dynasty|  period , although there is an argument to be made that the Bronze Age proper never ended in China, as there is no recognizable transition to an Iron Age . Without entering on the vexed question whether or not there ever was a bronze age in any part of the world distinguished by the sole use of that metal, it is a fact that in China and Japan to the present day, in the midst of an iron age, bronze is in constant use for cutting instruments, either alone or in combination with steel.

Monumentality in Early Chinese Art and Architecture. pp. 11, 13     Bronze  |metallurgy|Metallurgy|  in China originated in what is referred to as the  |Erlitou|Erlitou|   period, which some historians argue places it within the range of dates controlled by the  |Shang_dynasty|Shang_Dynasty| . Chang, K.C.: Studies of Shang Archaeology , pp. 6–7, 1. Yale University Press, 1982. Others believe the Erlitou sites belong to the preceding  |Xia|Xia_Dynasty|   dynasty. Chang, K.C.: Studies of Shang Archaeology , p. 1. Yale University Press, 1982. The U.S.  |National_Gallery_of_Art|National_Gallery_Of_Art|  defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the period between about 2000 BC and 771 BC, a period that begins with the Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of  |Western_Zhou|Western_Zhou_Dynasty|  rule.      The widespread use of bronze in Chinese metallurgy and culture dates to significantly later, probably due to Western influence. While there may be reason to believe that bronzework developed inside China separately from outside influence, Li-Liu; The Chinese Neolithic, Cambridge University Press, 2005.    Retrieved May 13, 2010 the discovery of Europoid  |mummies_in_Xinjiang|Tarim_Mummies|  suggests a possible route of transmission from the West beginning in the early second millennium BC.  This is, however, still just speculation since there is a lack of direct evidence. A few human mummies alone cannot provide sufficient explanation of metallurgy transmission. Furthermore, the oldest bronze objects found in China so far were discovered at the Majiayao site in Gansu rather than Xinjiang      The  |Shang_dynasty|Shang_Dynasty|  Thorp, R.L. .

While some direct information about the Shang dynasty comes from Shang-era inscriptions on bronze artifacts, most comes from oracle bones – turtle shells, cattle scapulae, or other bones – which bear glyphs that form the first significant corpus of recorded Chinese characters.     Iron is found from the  |Zhou_dynasty|Zhou_Dynasty| , but its use is minimal. Chinese literature dating to the 6th century BC attests knowledge of iron smelting, yet bronze continues to occupy the seat of significance in the archaeological and historical record for some time after this. Barnard, N.: Bronze Casting and Bronze Alloys in Ancient China , p. 14. The Australian National University and Monumenta Serica, 1961. Historian W.C. White argues that iron did not supplant bronze at any period before the end of the Zhou dynasty and that bronze vessels make up the majority of metal vessels all the way through the  |Later_Han_period|Han_Dynasty| , or to 221 BC. White, W.C.: Bronze Culture of Ancient China , p. 208. University of Toronto Press, 1956.     The Chinese bronze artifacts generally are either utilitarian, like spear points or adze heads, or  |_ritual_bronzes_|Chinese_Ritual_Bronzes| , which are more elaborate versions in precious materials of everyday vessels, as well as tools and weapons. Examples are the numerous large sacrificial tripods known as  |dings|Ding|  in Chinese; there are many other distinct shapes. Surviving identified Chinese ritual bronzes tend to be highly decorated, often with the  taotie  motif, which involves highly stylized animal faces. These appear in three main motif types: those of demons, of symbolic animals, and of abstract symbols. Erdberg, E.: Ancient Chinese Bronzes , p. 20. Siebenbad-Verlag, 1993. Many large bronzes also bear  |cast_inscriptions|Chinese_Bronze_Inscriptions|  that are the great bulk of the surviving body of early  |Chinese_writing|Chinese_Writing|  and have helped historians and archaeologists piece together the history of China, especially during the Zhou dynasty .     The bronzes of the Western Zhou dynasty document large portions of history not found in the extant texts that were often composed by persons of varying rank and possibly even social class. Further, the medium of cast bronze lends the record they preserve a permanence not enjoyed by manuscripts. Shaughnessy, E.L.: Sources of Western Zhou History , pp. xv–xvi. University of California Press, 1982. These inscriptions can commonly be subdivided into four parts: a reference to the date and place, the naming of the event commemorated, the list of gifts given to the artisan in exchange for the bronze, and a dedication. Shaughnessy, E.L. Sources of Western Zhou History , pp. 76–83. University of California Press, 1982. The relative points of reference these vessels provide have enabled historians to place most of the vessels within a certain time frame of the Western Zhou period, allowing them to trace the evolution of the vessels and the events they record. Shaughnessy, E.L. Sources of Western Zhou History , p. 107               The beginning of the Bronze Age on the peninsula is around 1000–800 BC. Carter J. Eckert, el., Korea, Old and New: History , 1990, pp. 9  Although the Korean Bronze Age culture derives from the  |Liaoning|Liaoning_Bronze_Dagger_Culture|  and Manchuria, it exhibits unique typology and styles, especially in ritual objects.      The  |Mumun_pottery_period|Mumun_Pottery_Period|  is named after the Korean name for undecorated or plain cooking and storage vessels that form a large part of the pottery assemblage over the entire length of the period, but especially 850–550 BC. The Mumun period is known for the origins of intensive agriculture and complex societies in both the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago.     The Middle Mumun pottery period culture of the southern  |Korean_Peninsula|Korean_Peninsula|  gradually adopted bronze production  after a period when Liaoning-style bronze daggers and other bronze artifacts were exchanged as far as the interior part of the Southern Peninsula . The bronze daggers lent prestige and authority to the personages who wielded and were buried with them in high-status megalithic burials at south-coastal centres such as the  |Igeum_dong_site|Igeum_Dong_Site| .  Bronze was an important element in ceremonies and as for mortuary offerings until 100.           The Japanese archipelago experienced the introduction of bronze during the beginning of the Early Yayoi period , which saw the introduction of metalworking and agricultural practices brought in by settlers arriving from the continent. Bronze and iron smelting techniques spread to the Japanese archipelago through contact with other ancient East Asian civilizations, particularly immigration and trade from the Korean peninsula and ancient Mainland China. Iron was mainly used for agricultural and other tools, whereas ritual and ceremonial artifacts were mainly made of bronze.       :Dates are approximate, consult particular article for details     ImageSize width:800 height:50   PlotArea width:720 height:25 left:65 bottom:20   AlignBars justify     Colors   id:age value:rgb   id:filler value:gray background bar   id:black value:black     Period from:-3300 till:-300   TimeAxis orientation:horizontal   ScaleMajor unit:year increment:500 start:-3300   ScaleMinor unit:year increment:100 start:-3300     PlotData   align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark: width:15 shift:     bar:India color:age   from: -3300 till: -1550 shift: text: |Bronze_Age_India|Bronze_Age_India|    from: -3300 till: -2700 text: |Early_Indus|Indus_Valley_Civilization|    from: -2700 till: -1900 text: |Mature_Harappan|Mature_Harappan|    from: -1900 till: -1550 text: |Late_Harappa|Cemetery_H_Culture|              The Bronze Age on the  |Indian_subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent|  began around 3300 BC with the beginning of the  |Indus_Valley_civilization|Indus_Valley_Civilization| . Inhabitants of the Indus Valley, the  |Harappa|Harappa| ns, developed new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, bronze, lead and tin. The Late Harappan culture, which dates from 1900–1400 BC, overlapped the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age; thus it is difficult to date this transition accurately. It has been claimed that a 6,000 year old copper  |amulet|Amulet|  manufactured in  |Mehrgarh|Mehrgarh|  in the shape of wheel spoke is the earliest example of  |lost_wax_casting|Lost_Wax_Casting|  in the world.          |Ban_Chiang|Ban_Chiang| ,  |Thailand|Thailand| ,  bronze  |artifacts|Artifact|  have been discovered dating to 2100 BC.  However, according to the radiocarbon dating on the human and pig bones in Ban Chiang, some scholars propose that the initial Bronze Age in Ban Chiang was in late 2nd millennium. In Nyaunggan,  |Burma|Burma| , bronze tools have been excavated along with ceramics and stone artifacts. Dating is still currently broad .  Ban Non Wat, excavated by Charles Higham, was a rich site with over 640 graves excavated that gleaned many complex bronze items that may have had social value connected to them.      Ban Chiang, however, is the most thoroughly documented site while having the clearest evidence of metallurgy when it comes to Southeast Asia. With a rough date range of late 3rd millennium BC to the first millennium AD, this site alone has various artifacts such as burial pottery , fragments of Bronze, copper-base bangles, and much more. Whats interesting about this site, however, isnt just the old age of the artifacts but the fact that this technology suggested on-site casting from the very beginning. The on-site casting supports the theory that Bronze was first introduced in Southeast Asia as fully developed which therefore shows that Bronze was actually innovated from a different country. Some scholars believe that the copper-based metallurgy was disseminated from northwest and central China via south and southwest areas such as Guangdong province and Yunnan province and finally into southeast Asia around 1000 BC.  Archaeology also suggests that Bronze Age metallurgy may not have been as significant a catalyst in social stratification and warfare in Southeast Asia as in other regions, social distribution shifting away from chiefdom-states to a heterarchical network.  Data analyses of sites such as Ban Lum Khao, Ban Na Di, Non Nok Tha, Khok Phanom Di, and Nong Nor have consistently led researchers to conclude that there was no forentrenched hierarchy.           Dating back to the  |Neolithic_Age|Neolithic_Age| , the first bronze drum, called the  |Dong_Son_drum|Dong_Son_Drum| , were uncovered in and around the  |Red_River_Delta|Red_River_Delta|  regions of Northern  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  and Southern China. These relate to the prehistoric  |Dong_Son_Culture|Dong_Son_Culture|  of Vietnam.      Archaeological research in Northern Vietnam indicates an increase in rates of infectious disease following the advent of metallurgy; skeletal fragments in sites dating to the early and mid-Bronze Age evidence a greater proportion of lesions than in sites of earlier periods.  There are a few possible implications of this. One is the increase contact with bacterial and/or fungal pathogens due to increased population density and land clearing/ cultivation. The other one is decreased levels of immunocompetence in the Metal age due to changes in diet caused by agriculture. The last is that there may have been an emergence of infectious disease in the Da But period that evolved into a more virulent form in the metal period.

A study in the journal  |Antiquity|Antiquity|  published in 2013 reported the discovery of a tin bronze foil from the Pločnik archaeological site securely dated to c. 4650 BC as well as 14 other artefacts from Serbia and Bulgaria dated to before 4000 BC has shown that early tin bronze was more common than previously thought, and developed independently in Europe 1500 years before the first tin bronze alloys in the Near East . The production of complex tin bronzes lasted for c. 500 years in the Balkans. The authors reported that evidence for the production of such complex bronzes disappears at the end of the 5th millennium coinciding with the collapse of large cultural complexes in north-eastern Bulgaria and Thrace in the late fifth millennium BC . Tin bronzes using cassiterite tin would be reintroduced to the area again some 1500 years later.       a , from Mycenae , Greece, 1550 BC     The Aegean Bronze Age began around 3200 BC, when civilizations first established a far-ranging trade network. This network imported tin and charcoal to Cyprus , where copper was mined and alloyed with the tin to produce bronze. Bronze objects were then exported far and wide, and supported the trade. Isotopic analysis of tin in some Mediterranean bronze artifacts suggests that they may have originated from Great Britain . Carl Waldman, Catherine Mason.

Knowledge of navigation was well developed at this time, and reached a peak of skill not exceeded until 1730 when the invention of the chronometer enabled the precise determination of longitude .     The Minoan civilization based in Knossos on the island of Crete appears to have coordinated and defended its Bronze Age trade. Illyrians are also believed to have roots in the early Bronze Age. Ancient empires valued luxury good s in contrast to staple foods , leading to famine. Lancaster, H.O. . Expectations of life: A study in the demography, statistics, and history of world mortality.

Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press Several Minoan client states lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the breadbasket of the Minoan empire, the area north of the Black Sea , also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some capacity to cultivate crops.Drought and famine in Anatolia may have also led to the Aegean Collapse by disrupting trade networks, and therefore preventing the Aegean from accessing bronze and luxury goods.     The Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the Cypriot forests causing the end of the bronze trade. Cities on the Sea., Swiny, S., Hohlfelder, R.L., & Swiny, H.W. .

These forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that charcoal production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late Bronze Age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.     The Aegean Collapse has also been attributed to the fact that as iron tools became more common, the main justification for the tin trade ended, and that trade network ceased to function as it did formerly.
