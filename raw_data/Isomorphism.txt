      In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , an isomorphism  is a  |homomorphism|Homomorphism|  or  |morphism|Morphism|   that can be reversed by an  |inverse|Inverse_Function|  morphism. Two  |mathematical_objects|Mathematical_Object|  are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them. An  automorphism  is an isomorphism whose source and target coincide. The interest of isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects cannot be distinguished by using only the properties used to define morphisms; thus isomorphic objects may be considered the same as long as one considers only these properties and their consequences.     For most  |algebraic_structures|Algebraic_Structure| , including  |groups|Group|  and  |rings|Ring| , a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is  |bijective|Bijective| .     In  |topology|Topology| , where the morphisms are  |continuous_functions|Continuous_Function| , isomorphisms are also called  homeomorphism s or bicontinuous functions. In  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis| , where the morphisms are  |differentiable_functions|Differentiable_Function| , isomorphisms are also called  diffeomorphism s.     A canonical isomorphism is a  |canonical_map|Canonical_Map|  that is an isomorphism. Two objects are said to be canonically isomorphic if there is a canonical isomorphism between them. For example, the canonical map from a finite-dimensional vector space V to its second dual space is a canonical isomorphism; on the other hand, V is isomorphic to its dual space but not canonically in general.     Isomorphisms are formalized using  |category_theory|Category_Theory| . A morphism  in a  |category|Category|  is an isomorphism if it admits a two-sided inverse, meaning that there is another morphism  in that category such that  and , where 1 X and 1 Y are the identity morphisms of X and Y respectively.             Let   be the  |multiplicative_group|Multiplicative_Group|  of  |positive_real_numbers|Positive_Real_Numbers| , and let   be the additive group of real numbers.     The  |logarithm_function|Logarithm_Function|            satisfies     x +   y for all x,y     , so it is a  |group_homomorphism|Group_Homomorphism| . The  |exponential_function|Exponential_Function|            satisfies   for all x,y     , so it too is a homomorphism.     The identities     x x and     y y show that   and   are  |inverses|Inverse_Function|  of each other. Since   is a homomorphism that has an inverse that is also a homomorphism,   is an isomorphism of groups.     Because   is an isomorphism, it translates multiplication of positive real numbers into addition of real numbers. This facility makes it possible to multiply real numbers using a  |ruler|Ruler|  and a  |table_of_logarithms|Table_Of_Logarithms| , or using a  |slide_rule|Slide_Rule|  with a logarithmic scale.       Consider the group , the integers from 0 to 5 with addition  |modulo|Modular_Arithmetic|   6. Also consider the group , the ordered pairs where the x coordinates can be 0 or 1, and the y coordinates can be 0, 1, or 2, where addition in the x-coordinate is modulo 2 and addition in the y-coordinate is modulo 3.     These structures are isomorphic under addition, under the following scheme:     : ↦ 0   : ↦ 1   : ↦ 2   : ↦ 3   : ↦ 4   : ↦ 5     or in general  mod 6.     For example, , which translates in the other system as .     Even though these two groups look different in that the sets contain different elements, they are indeed isomorphic |direct_product|Direct_Product_Of_Groups|  of two  |cyclic_groups|Cyclic_Group|    and   is isomorphic to if and only if m and n are  |coprime|Coprime| , per the  |Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese_Remainder_Theorem| .       If one object consists of a set X with a  |binary_relation|Binary_Relation|  R and the other object consists of a set Y with a binary relation S then an isomorphism from X to Y is a bijective function  such that:    :           S is  |reflexive|Reflexive_Relation| ,  |irreflexive|Irreflexive_Relation| ,  |symmetric|Symmetric_Relation| ,  |antisymmetric|Antisymmetric_Relation| ,  |asymmetric|Asymmetric_Relation| ,  |transitive|Transitive_Relation| ,  |total|Total_Relation| ,  |trichotomous|Binary_Relationrelations_Over_A_Set| , a  |partial_order|Partial_Order| ,  |total_order|Total_Order| ,  |well-order|Well-Order| ,  |strict_weak_order|Strict_Weak_Order| ,  |total_preorder|Strict_Weak_Ordertotal_Preorders|  , an  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation| , or a relation with any other special properties, if and only if R is.     For example, R is an  |ordering|Order_Theory|  ≤ and S an ordering     , then an isomorphism from X to Y is a bijective function  such that   : f   f   u   v .   Such an isomorphism is called an  order isomorphism  or an isotone isomorphism.     If , then this is a relation-preserving  |automorphism|Automorphism| .       In a  |concrete_category|Concrete_Category|  , such as the category of topological spaces or categories of algebraic objects like groups, rings, and  |modules|Module| , an isomorphism must be bijective on the  |underlying_sets|Underlying_Set| . In algebraic categories , an isomorphism is the same as a homomorphism which is bijective on underlying sets. However, there are concrete categories in which bijective morphisms are not necessarily isomorphisms .       In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , two basic isomorphisms are defined:    |Group_isomorphism|Group_Isomorphism| , an isomorphism between  |groups|Group| |Ring_isomorphism|Ring_Isomorphism| , an isomorphism between  |rings|Ring| .      Just as the  |automorphisms|Automorphism|  of an  |algebraic_structure|Algebraic_Structure|  form a  |group|Group| , the isomorphisms between two algebras sharing a common structure form a  |heap|Heap| . Letting a particular isomorphism identify the two structures turns this heap into a group.     In  |mathematical_analysis|Mathematical_Analysis| , the  |Laplace_transform|Laplace_Transform|  is an isomorphism mapping hard  |differential_equations|Differential_Equations|  into easier  |algebra|Algebra| ic equations.     In category theory, let the category C consist of two  |classes|Class| , one of objects and the other of morphisms. Then a general definition of isomorphism that covers the previous and many other cases is that an isomorphism is a morphism  that has an inverse morphism , i.e.  and . For example, a bijective  |linear_map|Linear_Map|  is an isomorphism between  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space| , and a bijective  |continuous_function|Continuous_Function|  whose inverse is also continuous is an isomorphism between  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space| , called a  |homeomorphism|Homeomorphism| .     In  |graph_theory|Graph_Theory| , an isomorphism between two graphs G and H is a  |bijective|Bijective|  map f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H that preserves the edge structure in the sense that there is an edge from  |vertex|Vertex|  u to vertex v in G if and only if there is an edge from ƒ to ƒ in H. See  |graph_isomorphism|Graph_Isomorphism| .     In mathematical analysis, an isomorphism between two  |Hilbert_spaces|Hilbert_Spaces|  is a bijection preserving addition, scalar multiplication, and inner product.     In early theories of  |logical_atomism|Logical_Atomism| , the formal relationship between facts and true propositions was theorized by  |Bertrand_Russell|Bertrand_Russell|  and  |Ludwig_Wittgenstein|Ludwig_Wittgenstein|  to be isomorphic. An example of this line of thinking can be found in Russells  Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy .     In  |cybernetics|Cybernetics| , the  |good_regulator|Good_Regulator|  or Conant–Ashby theorem is stated Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system . Whether regulated or self-regulating, an isomorphism is required between the regulator and processing parts of the system.            In certain areas of mathematics, notably category theory, it is valuable to distinguish between  equality  on the one hand and isomorphism on the other.  Equality is when two objects are exactly the same, and everything thats true about one object is true about the other, while an isomorphism implies everything thats true about a designated part of one objects structure is true about the others. For example, the sets   : A     .
