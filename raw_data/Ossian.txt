        Ossian  is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of  |epic_poems|Epic_Poem|  published by the Scottish poet  |James_Macpherson|James_Macpherson|  from 1760. Macpherson claimed to have collected  |word-of-mouth|Word-Of-Mouth|  material in  |Scottish_Gaelic|Scottish_Gaelic_Language| , said to be from ancient sources, and that the work was his translation of that material. Ossian is based on  |Oisín|Oisín| , son of Finn or  |Fionn_mac_Cumhaill|Fionn_Mac_Cumhaill| , anglicised to Finn McCool , a legendary bard who is a character in  |Irish_mythology|Irish_Mythology| . Contemporary critics were divided in their view of the works authenticity, but the consensus since is that Macpherson framed the poems himself, based on old folk tales he had collected.     The work was internationally popular, translated into all the literary languages of Europe and was highly influential both in the development of the  |Romantic_movement|Romanticism|  and the  |Gaelic_revival|Gaelic_Revival| . The contest over the authenticity of Macphersons pseudo-Gaelic productions, Curley asserts, became a seismograph of the fragile unity within restive diversity of  |imperial|British_Empire| |Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain|  in the age of  |Johnson|Samuel_Johnson| . Macphersons fame was crowned by his burial among the literary giants in  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey| .  |W.P._Ker|William_Paton_Ker| , in the Cambridge History of English Literature, observes that all Macphersons craft as a philological impostor would have been nothing without his literary skill. In The Cambridge History of English Literature, vol. 10 The Age of Johnson : The Literary Influence of the Middle Ages p. 228.          In 1760 Macpherson published the English-language text Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and translated from the Gaelic or Erse language.  Later that year, he claimed to have obtained further manuscripts and in 1761 he claimed to have found an  |epic|Epic_Poetry|  on the subject of the hero Fingal , written by Ossian. According to Macphersons prefatory material, his publisher, claiming that there was no market for these works except in English, required that they be translated. Macpherson published these translations during the next few years, culminating in a collected edition, The Works of Ossian, in 1765. The most famous of these Ossianic poems was Fingal, written in 1762.     The supposed original poems are translated into poetic prose, with short and simple sentences. The mood is  |epic|Epic_Poetry| , but there is no single narrative, although the same characters reappear. The main characters are Ossian himself, relating the stories when old and blind, his father Fingal , his dead son Oscar , and Oscars lover  |Malvina|Malvina|  , who looks after Ossian in his old age. Though the stories are of endless battles and unhappy loves , the enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and context. Okun, 328     Characters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and dying of grief, or of joy. There is very little information given on the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are hardly mentioned. The landscape is more real than the people who inhabit it. Drowned in eternal mist, illuminated by a decrepit sun or by ephemeral meteors, it is a world of greyness. Fingal is king of a region of south-west Scotland perhaps similar to the historical kingdom of  |Dál_Riata|Dál_Riata|  and the poems appear to be set around the 3rd century, with the king of the world mentioned being the Roman Emperor; Macpherson and his supporters detected references to  |Caracalla|Caracalla|  and  |Carausius|Carausius|  . , published as prefatory matter in later editions of the poems.       The poems achieved international success.  |Napoleon|Napoleon|  and  |Diderot|Diderot|  were prominent admirers and  |Voltaire|Voltaire|  was known to have written parodies of them. Howard Gaskill, https://books.google.com/books?iduDYPtqw0MHwC & pgPA140 The reception of Ossian in Europe  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson|  thought Ossian the greatest poet that has ever existed , Quoted in  and planned to learn Gaelic so as to read his poems in the original.  They were proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the  |Classical|Classical_Antiquity|  writers such as  |Homer|Homer| . The genuine remains of Ossian...are in many respects of the same stamp as the Iliad, was Thoreaus opinion. Thoreau, Henry David. Thoreau: Collected Essays and Poems. The Library of America. p. 141.  Many writers were influenced by the works, including  |Walter_Scott|Walter_Scott| , and painters and composers chose Ossianic subjects.     One poem was translated into French in 1762, and by 1777 the whole corpus. Okun, 330 In the German-speaking states  |Michael_Denis|Michael_Denis|  made the first full translation in 1768–69, inspiring the proto-nationalist poets  |Klopstock|Friedrich_Gottlieb_Klopstock|  and  |Goethe|Johann_Wolfgang_Von_Goethe| , whose own German translation of a portion of Macphersons work figures prominently in a climactic scene of  The Sorrows of Young Werther  .  Arnold M. Thor, myth to marvel; Continuum Publishing, 2011, pp92-97. Goethes associate  |Johann_Gottfried_Herder|Johann_Gottfried_Herder|  wrote an essay titled Extract from a correspondence about Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples in the early days of the  |Sturm_und_Drang|Sturm_Und_Drang|  movement.     Complete Danish translations were made in 1790, and Swedish ones in 1794–1800. In Scandinavia and Germany the Celtic nature of the setting was ignored or not understood, and Ossian was regarded as a Nordic or Germanic figure who became a symbol for nationalist aspirations. Okun, 330, 339 The French general  |Jean-Baptiste_Bernadotte|Jean-Baptiste_Bernadotte| , who was made King  |Charles_XIV_John_of_Sweden|Charles_Xiv_John_Of_Sweden|  and  |King_of_Norway|King_Of_Norway| , had already named his only son after a character from Ossian, at the suggestion of  |Napoleon|Napoleon| , the childs godfather and an admirer of Ossian;. Born in 1799, Bernadottes son later became King  |Oscar_I_of_Sweden_and_Norway|Oscar_I_Of_Sweden_And_Norway| , who was, in turn, succeeded by his sons  |Charles_XV_of_Sweden|Charles_Xv_Of_Sweden|  and  |Oscar_II|Oscar_Ii|  . Oscar being a Royal Swedish name led to its becoming also a common male first name, especially in Scandinavia but also in other European countries.      |Melchiore_Cesarotti|Melchiore_Cesarotti|  was an Italian clergyman whose translation into Italian is said by many to improve on the original, and was a tireless promoter of the poems, in  |Vienna|Vienna|  and  |Warsaw|Warsaw|  as well as Italy. It was his translation that Napoleon especially admired, and among others it influenced  |Ugo_Foscolo|Ugo_Foscolo|  who was Cesarottis pupil in the  |University_of_Padua|University_Of_Padua| .             By 1800 Ossian was translated into Spanish and Russian, with Dutch following in 1805, and Polish, Czech and Hungarian in 1827–33. The poems were as much admired in Hungary as in France and Germany; Hungarian  |János_Arany|János_Arany|  wrote Homer and Ossian in response, and several other Hungarian writers – Baróti Szabó,  |Csokonai|Mihály_Csokonai_Vitéz| ,  |Sándor_Kisfaludy|Sándor_Kisfaludy| ,  |Kazinczy|Ferenc_Kazinczy| ,  |Kölcsey|Kölcsey| ,  |Ferenc_Toldy|Ferenc_Toldy| , and Ágost Greguss, were also influenced by it.      The first partial  |Polish|Polish_Language|  translation of Ossian was made by  |Ignacy_Krasicki|Ignacy_Krasicki|  in 1793. The complete translation appeared in 1838 by  |Seweryn_Goszczyński|Seweryn_Goszczyński| .     The opera  Ossian, ou Les bardes  by  |Le_Sueur|Jean-François_Le_Sueur|  was a sell-out at the  |Paris_Opera|Paris_Opera|  in 1804, and transformed the composers career. The poems also exerted an influence on the burgeoning of  |Romantic_music|Romantic_Music| , and  |Franz_Schubert|Franz_Schubert|  in particular composed  |Lieder|Lieder|  setting many of Ossians poems. In 1829  |Felix_Mendelssohn|Felix_Mendelssohn|  was inspired to visit the Hebrides and composed the  Hebrides Overture , also known as Fingals Cave. His friend  |Niels_Gade|Niels_Gade|  devoted his first published work, the concert overture Efterklange af Ossian written in 1840, to the same subject.     The great Hungarian national poet  |Sándor_Petőfi|Sándor_Petőfi|  wrote a poem entitled Homer and Ossian, of which the first verse reads:          Likewise,  |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  was evidently positively impressed by Macphersons text when he wrote his poem Glen-Almain, the Narrow GlenThe Golden Treasury, Francis T. Palgrave.                 There were immediate disputes of Macphersons claims on both literary and political grounds. Macpherson promoted a Scottish origin for the material, and was hotly opposed by Irish historians who felt that their heritage was being appropriated. However, both Scotland and Ireland shared a common  |Gaelic|Gaels|  culture during the period in which the poems are set, and some  |Fenian|Fenian_Cycle|  literature common in both countries was composed in Scotland.      |Samuel_Johnson|Samuel_Johnson| , English author, critic, and biographer, was convinced that Macpherson was a  |mountebank|Wikt:Mountebank| , a liar, and a fraud, and that the poems were forgeries .  Johnson also dismissed the poems quality. Upon being asked, But Doctor Johnson, do you really believe that any man today could write such poetry? he famously replied, Yes. Many men. Many women. And many children. Johnson is cited as calling the story of Ossian as gross an imposition as ever the world was troubled with . Introduction of Robert Fagles translations of  |The_Iliad|The_Iliad|  and  |The_Odyssey|The_Odyssey|  In support of his claim, Johnson also called Gaelic the rude speech of a barbarous people, and said there were no manuscripts in it more than 100 years old. In reply, it was proved that the Advocates library at Edinburgh contained Gaelic manuscripts 500 years old, and one of even greater antiquity.      Scottish author  |Hugh_Blairs|Hugh_Blair|  1763 A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian upheld the works authenticity against Johnsons scathing criticism and from 1765 was included in every edition of Ossian to lend the work credibility. The work also had a timely resonance for those swept away by the emerging  |Romantic_movement|Romanticism|  and the theory of the  |noble_savage|Noble_Savage|  , and it echoed the popularity of  |Burkes|Edmund_Burke|  seminal  A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful  . J. Buchan, Crowded with Genius , , p. 163.     In 1766 the Irish antiquarian and Gaelic scholar  |Charles_OConor|Charles_Oconor|  dismissed Ossians authenticity in a new chapter Remarks on Mr. Mac Phersons translation of Fingal and Temora that he added to the second edition of his seminal history. OConor, C. Dissertations on the ancient history of Ireland http://www.exclassics.com/ossian/oconor.pdf  In 1775 he expanded his criticism in a new book, Dissertation on the origin and antiquities of the antient Scots.          Faced with the controversy, the Committee of the  |Highland_Society|Highland_Society_Of_London|  enquired after the authenticity of Macphersons supposed original. It was because of these circumstances that the so-called  |Glenmasan_manuscript|Glenmasan_Manuscript|  came to light in the late 18th century, a compilation which contains the tale Oided mac n-Uisnig. This text is a version of the Irish Longes mac n-Uislenn and offers a tale which bears some comparison to Macphersons Darthula , although it is radically different in many respects. Donald Smith cited it in his report for the Committee.      The controversy raged on into the early years of the 19th century, with disputes as to whether the poems were based on Irish sources, on sources in English, on Gaelic fragments woven into his own composition as Johnson concluded,  or largely on Scots Gaelic oral traditions and manuscripts as Macpherson claimed. Defences of the authenticity of the poems continued to be made. For example,  |Peter_Hately_Waddell|Peter_Hately_Waddell|  argued in Ossian and the Clyde that poems contained topographical references that could not have been known to Macpherson. Waddell, Peter Hately . Dictionary of National Biography. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1885–19.     In 1952, the Scottish literary scholar  |Derick_Thomson|Derick_Thomson|  investigated the sources for Macphersons work and concluded that Macpherson had collected genuine Scottish Gaelic  |ballads|Ballads| , employing scribes to record those that were preserved orally and collating manuscripts, but had adapted them by altering the original characters and ideas, and had introduced a great deal of his own.      Perhaps the strongest evidence that Macphersons Ossian was not a total fabrication is to be found in the oldest extant Scottish manuscript in Gaelic known as the  Book of the Dean of Lismore  . In the section of this manuscript which consists of heroic poetry and includes verse from as early as AD 1310, we find the names and exploits of almost all the leading protagonists in Macphersons text , together with legends and traditions associated with these characters.            Macphersons Ossian made a strong impression on  |Dugald_Buchanan|Dugald_Buchanan|  , a Perthshire poet whose celebrated Spiritual Hymns are written in a Scots Gaelic of a high quality that to some extent reflects the language of the classical Gaelic common to the bards of both Ireland and Scotland. Buchanan, taking the poems of Ossian to be authentic, was moved to revalue the genuine traditions and rich cultural heritage of the Gaels. At around the same time, he wrote to  |Sir_James_Clerk_of_Penicuik|Sir_James_Clerk,_3Rd_Baronet| , the leading antiquary of the movement, proposing that someone should travel to the Isles and Western Coast of Scotland and collect the work of the ancient and modern bards, in which alone he could find the language in its purity.     Much later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, this task was taken up by collectors such as  |Alexander_Carmichael|Alexander_Carmichael|  Carmina Gadelica, Alexander Carmichael, printed by T. & A. Constable, Edinburgh, 1900. and  |Lady_Evelyn_Stewart_Murray|Lady_Evelyn_Stewart_Murray| , Tales from Highland Perthshire, collected by Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray, translated and edited by Sylvia Robertson and Tony Dilworth, Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, Volume 20, 2009. and to be recorded and continued by the work of the  |School_of_Scottish_Studies|School_Of_Scottish_Studies|  and the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society.       Subjects from the Ossian poems were popular in the art of northern Europe, but at rather different periods depending on the country; by the time French artists began to depict Ossian, British artists had largely dropped him. Ossian was especially popular in  |Danish_art|Danish_Art| , but also found in Germany and the rest of Scandinavia.       British artists began to depict the Ossian poems early on, with the first major work a cycle of paintings decorating the ceiling the Grand Hall of  |Penicuik_House|Penicuik_House|  in  |Midlothian|Midlothian| , built by  |Sir_James_Clerk|Clerk_Baronets| , who commissioned the paintings in 1772. These were by the Scottish painter  |Alexander_Runciman|Alexander_Runciman|  and lost when the house burnt down in 1899, though drawings and  |etchings|Etching|  survive, and two pamphlets describing them were published in the 18th century. Okun, 331–334 A subject from Ossian by  |Angelica_Kauffman|Angelica_Kauffman|  was shown in the  |Royal_Academy|Royal_Academy|  exhibition of 1773, and Ossian was depicted in Elysium, part of the Irish painter  |James_Barrys|James_Barry|  magnum opus decorating the  |Royal_Society_of_Arts|Royal_Society_Of_Arts| , at the  |Adelphi_Buildings|Adelphi_Buildings|  in London . Okun, 334–335          Works on paper by  |Thomas_Girtin|Thomas_Girtin|  and  |John_Sell_Cotman|John_Sell_Cotman|  have survived, though the Ossianic landscapes by George Augustus Wallis, which the Ossian fan  |August_Wilhelm_Schlegel|August_Wilhelm_Schlegel|  praised in a letter to Goethe, seem to have been lost, as has a picture by  |J.M.W._Turner|J.M.W._Turner|  exhibited in 1802.  |Henry_Singleton|Henry_Singleton|  exhibited paintings, some of which were engraved and used in editions of the poems. Okun, 336–338     A fragment by  |Novalis|Novalis| , written in 1789, refers to Ossian as an inspired, holy and poetical singer. Schmidt, 976     The Danish painter  |Nicolai_Abildgaard|Nicolai_Abildgaard| , Director of the  |Copenhagen_Academy|Copenhagen_Academy|  from 1789, painted several scenes from Ossian, as did his pupils including  |Asmus_Jacob_Carstens|Asmus_Jacob_Carstens| . Okun, 339–341 His friend  |Joseph_Anton_Koch|Joseph_Anton_Koch|  painted a number of subjects, and two large series of illustrations for the poems, which never got properly into print; like many Ossianic works by Wallis, Carstens, Krafft and others, some of these were painted in Rome, perhaps not the best place to evoke the dim northern light of the poems. In Germany the request in 1804 to produce some drawings as illustrations so excited  |Philipp_Otto_Runge|Philipp_Otto_Runge|  that he planned a series of 100, far more than asked for, in a style heavily influenced by the linear illustrations of  |John_Flaxman|John_Flaxman| ; these remain as drawings only. Okun, 338–345 Many other German works are recorded, some as late as the 1840s; Okun, 335–346 word of the British scepticism over the Ossian poems was slow to penetrate the continent, or considered irrelevant.            In France the enthusiasm of Napoleon for the poems accounts for most artistic depictions, and those by the most famous artists, but a painting exhibited in the  |Paris_Salon|Paris_Salon|  in 1800 by  |Paul_Duqueylar|Paul_Duqueylar|   excited Les Barbus a group of primitivist artists including  |Pierre-Maurice_Quays|Pierre-Maurice_Quays|  who promoted living in the style of early civilizations as described in Homer, Ossian, and the Bible . Okun, 346–347 Quays is reported as saying: Homère? Ossian? ... le soleil? la lune? Voilà la question. En vérité, je crois que je préfère la lune. Cest plus simple, plus grand, plus primitif . . Rubin, 383 The same year Napoleon was planning the renovation of the  |Château_de_Malmaison|Château_De_Malmaison|  as a summer palace, and though he does not seem to have suggested Ossianic subjects for his painters, two large and significant works were among those painted for the reception hall, for which six artists had been commissioned.             These were  |Girodets|Anne-Louis_Girodet_De_Roussy-Trioson|  painting of 1801–02 Ossian receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes, and Ossian Evoking ghosts on the Edge of the Lora , by  |François_Pascal_Simon_Gérard|François_Gérard| . Gérards original was lost in a shipwreck after being bought by the King of Sweden after the fall of Napoleon, but survives in three replicas by the artist . One is now at Malmaison , and the  |Kunsthalle_Hamburg|Kunsthalle_Hamburg|  has another . A  |watercolour|Watercolour|  copy by  |Jean-Baptiste_Isabey|Jean-Baptiste_Isabey|  was placed as  |frontispiece|Book_Frontispiece|  to Napoleons copy of the poems. Okun, 347–348; Rubin throughout, and pp. 384–386 on the variety of titles by which the work has been known;       Duqueylar, Girodet and Gérard, like  |Johann_Peter_Krafft|Johann_Peter_Krafft|  and most of the Barbus, were all pupils of  |David|Jacques-Louis_David| , and the clearly unclassical subjects of the Ossian poems were useful for emergent French Romantic painting, marking a revolt against Davids  |Neoclassical|Neoclassicism|  choice of historical subject-matter. Davids recorded reactions to the paintings were guarded or hostile; he said of Girodets work: Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting . Honour, 184–190, 187 quoted     Girodets painting was a success de scandale when exhibited in 1802, and remains a key work in the emergence of French Romantic painting, but the specific allusions to the political situation that he intended it to carry were largely lost on the public, and overtaken by the  |Peace_of_Amiens|Peace_Of_Amiens|  with Great Britain, signed in 1802 between the completion and exhibition of the work. Okun, 349–351;   He also produced Malvina dying in the arms of Fingal , and other works.     Another pupil of David,  |Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres|Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres| , was to depict Ossianic scenes over most of his long career. He made a drawing in 1809, when studying in Rome, and in 1810 or 1811 was commisissioned to make two paintings, the Dream of Ossian and a classical scene, to decorate the bedroom Napoleon was to occupy in the  |Palazzo_Quirinale|Palazzo_Quirinale|  on a visit to Rome. In fact the visit never came off and in 1835 Ingres repurchased the work, now in poor condition.        |National_Library_of_Scotland|National_Library_Of_Scotland|  has 327 books and associated materials in its Ossian Collection. The collection was originally assembled by J. Norman Methven of Perth and includes different editions and translations of James Macphersons epic poem Ossian, some with a map of the Kingdom of Connor. It also contains secondary material relating to Ossianic poetry and the Ossian controversy. More than 200 items from the collection have been digitised.
