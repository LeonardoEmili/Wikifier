         Selenium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Se and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|   34. It is a  |nonmetal|Nonmetal|   with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| ,  |sulfur|Sulfur|  and  |tellurium|Tellurium| , and also has similarities to  |arsenic|Arsenic| . It rarely occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earths crust. Selenium – from  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|   Moon – was discovered in 1817 by  |Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius| , who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered  |tellurium|Tellurium|  .     Selenium is found in  |metal_sulfide_ores|:Category:Sulfide_Minerals| , where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are  |glassmaking|Glassmaking|  and  |pigments|Pigment| . Selenium is a  |semiconductor|Semiconductor|  and is used in  |photocells|Photocell| . Applications in  |electronics|Electronics| , once important, have been mostly replaced with  |silicon|Silicon|  semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power  |surge_protectors|Surge_Protector|  and one type of  |fluorescent|Fluorescence| |quantum_dot|Quantum_Dot| .     Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, including  |infant_formula|Infant_Formula| . It is a component of the antioxidant enzymes  |glutathione_peroxidase|Glutathione_Peroxidase|  and  |thioredoxin_reductase|Thioredoxin_Reductase|  . It is also found in three  |deiodinase|Deiodinase|  enzymes, which convert one  |thyroid_hormone|Thyroid_Hormone|  to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently requiring none.             Selenium forms several  |allotropes|Allotrope|  that interconvert with temperature changes, depending somewhat on the rate of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an  |amorphous|Amorphous_Solid| , brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads.  The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000  atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in  |CS_2|Carbon_Disulfide| . Upon heating, it softens at 50  °C and converts to gray selenium at 180  °C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of  |halogens|Halogen|  and  |amines|Amine| .      The red α, β, and γ forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying the evaporation rate of the solvent . They all have relatively low,  |monoclinic|Monoclinic|  crystal symmetries and contain nearly identical puckered Se 8 rings with different arrangements, as in  |sulfur|Sulfur| . The packing is most dense in the α form. In the Se 8 rings, the Se-Se distance is 233.5 pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 105.7°  . Other selenium allotropes may contain Se 6 or Se 7 rings.     The most stable and dense form of selenium is gray and has a hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se distance is 237.3  pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1°  . The minimum distance between chains is 343.6  pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable  |photoconductivity|Photoconductivity| . Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS 2 . It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing  |acids|Acid| . With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.        Owing to its use as a photoconductor in flat-panel x-ray detectors , the optical properties of amorphous selenium thin films have been the subject of intense research.               Selenium has seven naturally occurring  |isotopes|Isotope| . Five of these, 74 Se, 76 Se, 77 Se, 78 Se, 80 Se, are stable, with 80 Se being the most abundant . Also naturally occurring is the long-lived  |primordial_radionuclide|Primordial_Radionuclide|  82 Se, with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 9.2×10 19 years. The non-primordial radioisotope  |79_Se|Selenium-79|  also occurs in minute quantities in  |uranium|Uranium|  ores as a product of  |nuclear_fission|Nuclear_Fission| . Selenium also has numerous unstable  |synthetic_isotopes|Synthetic_Isotope|  ranging from 64 Se to 95 Se; the most stable are 75 Se with a half-life of 119.78  days and 72 Se with a half-life of 8.4  days. Isotopes lighter than the stable isotopes primarily undergo  |beta_plus_decay|Beta_Plus_Decay|  to  |isotopes_of_arsenic|Isotopes_Of_Arsenic| , and isotopes heavier than the stable isotopes undergo  |beta_minus_decay|Beta_Minus_Decay|  to  |isotopes_of_bromine|Isotopes_Of_Bromine| , with some minor  |neutron_emission|Neutron_Emission|  branches in the heaviest known isotopes.               Selenium compounds commonly exist in the  |oxidation_states|Oxidation_State|  −2, +2, +4, and +6.       Selenium forms two  |oxides|Oxide| :  |selenium_dioxide|Selenium_Dioxide|  and  |selenium_trioxide|Selenium_Trioxide|  . Selenium dioxide is formed by the reaction of elemental selenium with oxygen:   :Se 8 + 8 O 2 → 8 SeO 2      It is a  |polymer|Polymer| ic solid that forms monomeric SeO 2 molecules in the gas phase. It dissolves in water to form  |selenous_acid|Selenous_Acid| , H 2 SeO 3 . Selenous acid can also be made directly by oxidizing elemental selenium with  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|      :3 Se + 4 HNO 3 + H 2 O → 3 H 2 SeO 3 + 4 NO   Unlike sulfur, which forms a stable  |trioxide|Sulfur_Trioxide| , selenium trioxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to the dioxide above 185  °C:     :2 SeO 3 → 2 SeO 2 + O 2   Selenium trioxide is produced in the laboratory by the reaction of  |anhydrous|Anhydrous| |potassium_selenate|Potassium_Selenate|  and sulfur trioxide .       |Salts|Salt|  of selenous acid are called selenites. These include  |silver_selenite|Silver_Selenite|  and  |sodium_selenite|Sodium_Selenite|  .      |Hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  reacts with aqueous selenous acid to produce  |selenium_disulfide|Selenium_Disulfide| |dandruff|Dandruff|  agent, an inhibitor in polymer chemistry, a glass dye, and a reducing agent in  |fireworks|Fireworks| .     Selenium trioxide may be synthesized by dehydrating  |selenic_acid|Selenic_Acid| , H 2 SeO 4 , which is itself produced by the oxidation of selenium dioxide with  |hydrogen_peroxide|Hydrogen_Peroxide|  The report describes the synthesis of selenic acid.   :SeO 2 + H 2 O 2 → H 2 SeO 4     Hot, concentrated selenic acid can react with gold to form gold selenate.         |Iodides|Iodide|  of selenium are not well known. The only stable  |chloride|Chloride|  is  |selenium_monochloride|Selenium_Monochloride|  , which might be better known as selenium chloride; the corresponding  |bromide|Bromide|  is also known. These species are structurally analogous to the corresponding  |disulfur_dichloride|Disulfur_Dichloride| . Selenium dichloride is an important reagent in the preparation of selenium compounds . It is prepared by treating selenium with  |sulfuryl_chloride|Sulfuryl_Chloride|  .  Selenium reacts with  |fluorine|Fluorine|  to form  |selenium_hexafluoride|Selenium_Hexafluoride| ,  |selenium_hexafluoride|Selenium_Hexafluoride|  is more reactive and is a toxic  |pulmonary|Pulmonary|  irritant.    Some of the selenium oxyhalides, such as  |selenium_oxyfluoride|Selenium_Oxyfluoride|  and  |selenium_oxychloride|Selenium_Oxychloride|  have been used as specialty solvents.       Analogous to the behavior of other chalcogens, selenium forms  |hydrogen_selenide|Hydrogen_Selenide| , H 2 Se. It is a strongly  |odiferous|Wikt:Odiferous| , toxic, and colorless gas. It is more acidic than H 2 S. In solution it ionizes to HSe − . The selenide dianion Se 2− forms a variety of compounds, including the minerals from which selenium is obtained commercially. Illustrative selenides include  |mercury_selenide|Mercury_Selenide|  ,  |lead_selenide|Lead_Selenide|  ,  |zinc_selenide|Zinc_Selenide|  , and  |copper_indium_gallium_diselenide|Copper_Indium_Gallium_Diselenide|  . These materials are  |semiconductors|Semiconductor| . With highly electropositive metals, such as  |aluminium|Aluminium| , these selenides are prone to hydrolysis:   :Al 2 Se 3 + 3 H 2 O → Al 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 Se   Alkali metal selenides react with selenium to form polyselenides, , which exist as chains.       Tetraselenium tetranitride, Se 4 N 4 , is an explosive orange compound analogous to  |tetrasulfur_tetranitride|Tetrasulfur_Tetranitride|  .   It can be synthesized by the reaction of  |selenium_tetrachloride|Selenium_Tetrachloride|  with .      Selenium reacts with  |cyanides|Cyanide|  to yield  |selenocyanates|Potassium_Selenocyanate|    Selenium, especially in the II oxidation state, forms stable bonds to  |carbon|Carbon| , which are structurally analogous to the corresponding  |organosulfur_compounds|Organosulfur_Compounds| . Especially common are selenides , diselenides , and  |selenols|Selenol|  . Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively  |selenomethionine|Selenomethionine| ,  |diphenyldiselenide|Diphenyldiselenide| , and  |benzeneselenol|Benzeneselenol| . The  |sulfoxide|Sulfoxide|  in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides , which are intermediates in organic synthesis, as illustrated by the  |selenoxide_elimination|Selenoxide_Elimination|  reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the  |double_bond_rule|Double_Bond_Rule| , selenoketones, RR, and selenaldehydes, RH, are rarely observed.        Selenium  was discovered in 1817 by  |Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jakob_Berzelius|  and  |Johan_Gottlieb_Gahn|Johan_Gottlieb_Gahn| .  From p. 203:  Cependant, pour rappeler les rapports de cette dernière avec le tellure, je lai nommée sélénium.  Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near  |Gripsholm|Gripsholm| , Sweden, producing  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  by the  |lead_chamber_process|Lead_Chamber_Process| . The pyrite from the  |Falun_mine|Great_Copper_Mountain|  created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrites use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like  |horseradish|Horseradish|  when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from  |tellurium|Tellurium|  compounds. Hence, Berzeliuss first letter to  |Alexander_Marcet|Alexander_Marcet|  stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the  |Falun_mine|Great_Copper_Mountain|  minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to  |sulfur|Sulfur|  and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the  |Moon|Moon| .        In 1873,  |Willoughby_Smith|Willoughby_Smith|  found that the electrical resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light.   This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by  |Werner_Siemens|Werner_Siemens|  in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell was used in the  |photophone|Photophone|  developed by  |Alexander_Graham_Bell|Alexander_Graham_Bell|  in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of  |light_meters|Light_Meter|  and similar devices. Seleniums semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics.   see  |SECIS_element|Secis_Element| i.e., elementalhair-like |ner|Ner| calcium sulfate hydrateanalogous to sulfate |tallur|Tallur| SX/EW |oxidation|Oxidation|  step |reduction|Redox|  step650  t630  t200  t140  tin 100  pound lotsLi–Seα-Sealthough it was still a large end-useor are being replacedSe+24some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as  |locoweed|Locoweed| , require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil |ochemist|Ochemist| this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require seleniumGSH-PxOnly the deiodinase  |iodotyrosine_deiodinase|Iodotyrosine_Deiodinase| , which works on the last breakdown products of thyroid hormone, does not use selenium.the  |glutathione_peroxidases|Glutathione_Peroxidase| |thioredoxin_reductase|Thioredoxin_Reductase| vitamin Cincluding flavonoidsthe dominant type of plant todaythough this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needsRDAFDAincluding some  |locoweeds|Locoweed|   Stanleya  sp.
