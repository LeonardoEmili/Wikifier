   In  |chemistry|Chemistry|  and  |physics|Physics| , a nucleon is either a  |proton|Proton|  or a  |neutron|Neutron| , considered in its role as a component of an  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus| . The number of nucleons in a nucleus defines an  |isotopes|Isotope| |_mass_number_|Mass_Number| .     Until the 1960s, nucleons were thought to be  |elementary_particles|Elementary_Particle| , not made up of smaller parts. Now they are known to be  |composite_particles|Composite_Particle| , made of three  |quarks|Quark|  bound together by the so-called  |strong_interaction|Strong_Interaction| . The interaction between two or more nucleons is called  |internucleon_interaction|Internucleon_Interaction|  or  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force| , which is also ultimately caused by the strong interaction.     Nucleons sit at the boundary where  |particle_physics|Particle_Physics|  and  |nuclear_physics|Nuclear_Physics|  overlap. Particle physics, particularly  |quantum_chromodynamics|Quantum_Chromodynamics| , provides the fundamental equations that explain the properties of quarks and of the strong interaction. These equations explain quantitatively how quarks can bind together into protons and neutrons . However, when multiple nucleons are assembled into an atomic nucleus , these fundamental equations become too difficult to solve directly . Instead, nuclides are studied within  |nuclear_physics|Nuclear_Physics| , which studies nucleons and their interactions by approximations and models, such as the  |nuclear_shell_model|Nuclear_Shell_Model| . These models can successfully explain nuclide properties, as for example, whether or not a particular nuclide undergoes  |radioactive_decay|Radioactive_Decay| .     The proton and neutron are in a scheme of categories being at once  |fermions|Fermion| ,  |hadrons|Hadron|  and  |baryons|Baryon| . The proton carries a positive net  |charge|Electric_Charge|  and the neutron carries a zero net charge; the protons  |mass|Mass|  is only about 0.13% less than the neutrons. Thus, they can be viewed as two states of the same nucleon, and together form an  |isospin|Isospin|  doublet . In isospin space, neutrons can be transformed into protons via  |SU|Su|  symmetries, and vice versa. These nucleons are acted upon equally by the strong interaction, which is invariant under rotation in isospin space. According to the  |Noether_theorem|Noether_Theorem| , isospin is conserved with respect to the strong interaction.                   Protons and neutrons are best known in their role as nucleons, i.e., as the components of atomic nuclei, but they also exist as free particles. Free neutrons are unstable, with a half-life of around 13 minutes, but they have important applications . Protons not bound to other nucleons are the nuclei of hydrogen atoms when bound with an  |electron|Electron|  or—if not bound to anything—are  |ions|Ion|  or cosmic rays.     Neither the proton nor neutron is an  |elementary_particle|Elementary_Particle| , meaning each is composed of smaller parts, namely three  |quarks|Quarks|  each. A proton is composed of two  |up_quarks|Up_Quark|  and one  |down_quark|Down_Quark| , while the neutron has one up quark and two down quarks. Quarks are held together by the  |strong_force|Strong_Interaction| , or equivalently, by  |gluons|Gluon| , which mediate the strong force.     An up quark has  |electric_charge|Electric_Charge|  +    |e|Elementary_Charge| , and a down quark has charge −   e, so the summed electric charges of proton and neutron are + |e|Elementary_Charge|  and 0, respectively. The resultant coefficients are obtained by summation of the component charges: Σ +  + +  + −  +  + 1, and Σ +  + −  + −   0. Thus, the neutron has a charge of 0 , and therefore is electrically neutral; indeed, the term neutron comes from the fact that a neutron is electrically neutral.     The mass of the proton and neutron is quite similar: The proton is  or , while the neutron is  or . The neutron is roughly 0.13% heavier. The similarity in mass can be explained roughly by the slight difference in masses of up quarks and down quarks composing the nucleons. However, a detailed explanation remains an unsolved problem in particle physics.      The  |spin|Spin|  of the nucleon is , which means they are  |fermions|Fermion|  and, like electrons, are subject to the  |Pauli_exclusion_principle|Pauli_Exclusion_Principle| . No more than one nucleon, e.g. in an atomic nucleus, may occupy the same  |quantum_state|Quantum_State| . The isospin and  |spin|Spin_Quantum_Number|  quantum numbers of the nucleon have two states each, resulting in four combinations in total. An  |alpha_particle|Alpha_Particle|  is composed of four nucleons occupying all four combinations, namely it has two protons  and two neutrons and its net  |nuclear_spin|Nuclear_Spin|  is zero. In larger nuclei constituent nucleons, to avoid Pauli exclusion, are compelled to have relative  |motion|Motion|  which may also contribute to nuclear spin via the  |orbital_quantum_number|Orbital_Quantum_Number| . They spread out into  |nuclear_shells|Nuclear_Shell|  analogous to  |electron_shells|Electron_Shell|  in chemistry.     The  |magnetic_moment|Magnetic_Moment|  of a proton, denoted μ p , is , while the magnetic moment of a neutron is μ n . These parameters are also important in  |NMR_MRI|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance| .       A neutron in free state is an unstable particle, with a  |half_life|Half_Life|  around ten minutes. It undergoes  |_decay|Beta_Decay|   by turning into a proton while emitting an electron and an  |electron_antineutrino|Electron_Antineutrino| .  A proton by itself is thought to be stable, or at least its lifetime is too long to measure. This is an important discussion in particle physics, .     Inside a nucleus, on the other hand, combined protons and neutrons can be stable or unstable depending on the  |nuclide|Nuclide| , or nuclear species. Inside some nuclides, a neutron can turn into a proton as described above; the reverse can happen inside other nuclides, where a proton turns into a neutron through  |_decay|Beta_Decay| , or  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture| . And inside still other nuclides, both protons and neutrons are stable and do not change form.            Both nucleons have corresponding  |antiparticles|Antiparticle| : the  |antiproton|Antiproton|  and the  |antineutron|Antineutron| , which have the same mass and opposite charge as the proton and neutron respectively, and they interact in the same way.  In particular, antinucleons can bind into an antinucleus . So far, scientists have created  |antideuterium|Antideuterium|    and antihelium-3    nuclei.               The masses of the proton and neutron are known with far greater precision in  |atomic_mass_units|Atomic_Mass_Unit|  than in MeV/c 2 , due to the relatively poorly known value of the  |elementary_charge|Elementary_Charge| . The conversion factor used is 1 u  MeV/c 2 .   The masses of their antiparticles are assumed to be identical, and no experiments have refuted this to date. Current experiments show any percent difference between the masses of the proton and antiproton must be less than  and the difference between the neutron and antineutron masses is on the order of  MeV/c 2 .
