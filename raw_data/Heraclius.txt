                     Heraclius  was the  |Emperor|List_Of_Byzantine_Emperors|  of the  |Byzantine_Empire|Byzantine_Empire|  from 610 to 641. His rise to power began in 608, when he and his father,  |Heraclius_the_Elder|Heraclius_The_Elder| , the  |exarch_of_Africa|Exarchate_Of_Africa| , led a revolt against the unpopular usurper  |Phocas|Phocas| .     Heracliuss reign was marked by several military campaigns. The year Heraclius came to power, the empire was threatened on multiple frontiers. Heraclius immediately took charge of the  |Byzantine–Sasanian_War_of_602–628|Byzantine–Sasanian_War_Of_602–628| . The first battles of the campaign ended in defeat for the Byzantines; the Persian army fought their way to the  |Bosphorus|Bosphorus|  but  |Constantinople|Constantinople|  was protected by impenetrable walls and a strong navy, and Heraclius was able to avoid total defeat. Soon after, he initiated reforms to rebuild and strengthen the military. Heraclius drove the Persians out of  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  and pushed deep into their territory, defeating them decisively in 627 at the  |Battle_of_Nineveh|Battle_Of_Nineveh| . The Persian king  |_Khosrow_II|Khosrau_Ii|  was overthrown and executed by his son  |Kavad_II|Kavad_Ii| , who soon sued for a peace treaty, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territory. This way peaceful relations were restored to the two deeply strained empires.     Heraclius lost many of his newly-regained lands to the  |Muslim_conquests|Muslim_Conquests| . Emerging from the  |Arabian_Peninsula|Arabian_Peninsula| , the Muslims quickly conquered the  |Sasanian_Empire|Sasanian_Empire| . In 634 the Muslims marched into  |Roman_Syria|Roman_Syria| , defeating Heracliuss brother  |Theodore|Theodore|  . Within a short period of time, the Arabs conquered  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| ,  |Armenia|United_Armenia|  and  |Egypt|Diocese_Of_Egypt| .     Heraclius entered diplomatic relations with the  |Croats|Croats|  and  |Serbs|Serbs|  in the  |Balkans|Balkans| . He tried to repair the schism in the Christian church in regard to the  |Monophysites|Monophysite| , by promoting a compromise doctrine called  |Monothelitism|Monothelitism| . The  |Church_of_the_East|Church_Of_The_East|  was also involved in the process.  , Simvol 61: Syriaca-Arabica-Iranica. , pp. 280–300. Eventually this project of unity was rejected by all sides of the dispute.         Heraclius was the eldest son of  |Heraclius_the_Elder|Heraclius_The_Elder|  and Epiphania, of a family of possible  |Armenian|Armenians|  origin from  |Cappadocia|Cappadocia| ,  |Treadgold_1997|Reftreadgold1997| , p. 287. with speculative  |Arsacid|Arsacid_Dynasty_Of_Armenia|  descent.  Beyond that, there is little specific information known about his ancestry. His father was a key general during Emperor  |Maurices|Maurice|  war with  |Bahram_Chobin|Bahram_Chobin| , usurper of the  |Sasanian_Empire|Sasanian_Empire| , during 590.  |Kaegi_2003|Refkaegi2003| , pp. 24–25. After the war, Maurice appointed Heraclius the Elder to the position of  |Exarch|Exarch|  of  |Africa|Africa_Province| .             In 608, Heraclius the Elder renounced his loyalty to the Emperor  |Phocas|Phocas| , who had overthrown Maurice six years earlier. The rebels issued coins showing both Heraclii dressed as  |consuls|Consul| , though neither of them explicitly claimed the imperial title at this time.  |Mitchell_2007|Refmitchell2007| , p. 411. Heracliuss younger cousin  |Nicetas|Nicetas|  launched an overland invasion of  |Egypt|Aegyptus| ; by 609, he had defeated Phocass general  |Bonosus|Bonus|  and secured the province. Meanwhile, the younger Heraclius sailed eastward with another force via  |Sicily|Sicily|  and  |Cyprus|Cyprus| .     As he approached  |Constantinople|Constantinople| , he made contact with prominent leaders and planned an attack to overthrow  |aristocrats|Aristocracy|  in the city, and soon arranged a ceremony where he was crowned and acclaimed as Emperor. When he reached the capital, the  |Excubitors|Excubitors| , an elite Imperial Guard unit led by Phocass son-in-law  |Priscus|Priscus| , deserted to Heraclius, and he entered the city without serious resistance. When Heraclius captured Phocas, he asked him Is this how you have ruled, wretch? Phocass reply— And will you rule better? —so enraged Heraclius that he beheaded Phocas on the spot.  |Olster_1993|Refolster1993| , p. 133. He later had the genitalia removed from the body because Phocas had raped the wife of Photius, a powerful politician in the city. .     On October 5, 610, Heraclius was crowned for a second time, this time in the Chapel of St. Stephen within the  |_Great_Palace|Great_Palace_Of_Constantinople| ; at the same time he married Fabia, who took the name  |Eudokia|Fabia_Eudokia| . After her death in 612, he married his niece  |Martina|Martina|  in 613; this second marriage was considered  |incest|Incest| uous and was very unpopular.  |Kaegi_2003|Refkaegi2003| , p. 106. In the reign of Heracliuss two sons, the divisive Martina was to become the center of power and political intrigue. Despite widespread hatred for Martina in Constantinople, Heraclius took her on campaigns with him and refused attempts by  |Patriarch|Patriarch|  Sergius to prevent and later dissolve the marriage.              During his  |Balkan_Campaigns|Maurices_Balkan_Campaigns| , Emperor  |Maurice|Maurice|  and his family were murdered by  |Phocas|Phocas|  in November 602 after a mutiny.  |Gibbon_1994|Refgibbon1994| , chap. 46,   ii.902.  |Khosrow_II|Khosrow_Ii|  of the  |Sasanian_Empire|Sasanian_Empire|  had been restored to his throne by Maurice, and they had remained allies until the latters death. Thereafter, Khosrow seized the opportunity to attack the Byzantine Empire and reconquer  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| .  |Foss_1975|Reffoss1975| , p. 722. Khosrow had at his court a man who claimed to be Maurices son  |Theodosius|Theodosius| , and Khosrow demanded that the Byzantines accept this Theodosius as Emperor.          The war initially went the Persians way, partly because of Phocass brutal repression and the succession crisis that ensued as the general Heraclius sent his nephew  |Nicetas|Nicetas|  to attack  |Egypt|Egypt| , enabling his son Heraclius the younger to claim the throne in 610.  |Gibbon_1994|Refgibbon1994| , ii.906. Phocas, an unpopular ruler who is invariably described in historical sources as a tyrant , was eventually deposed by Heraclius, who sailed to Constantinople from  |Carthage|Carthage|  with an icon affixed to the prow of his ship.  |Haldon_1997|Refhaldon1997| , p. 41.  |Speck_1984|Refspeck1984| , p. 178.     By this time, the Persians had conquered Mesopotamia and the  |Caucasus|Caucasus| , and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia. A major counter-attack led by Heraclius two years later was decisively defeated outside  |Antioch|Antioch|  by  |Shahrbaraz|Shahrbaraz|  and  |Shahin|Shahin_Vahmanzadegan| , and the Roman position collapsed; the Persians devastated parts of Asia Minor and captured  |Chalcedon|Chalcedon|  across from Constantinople on the  |Bosporus|Bosporus| .  |Greatrex_Lieu_2002|Refgreatrexlieu2002| , pp. II, 194–195.     Over the following decade the Persians were able to conquer  |Palestine|Palestine|  and Egypt  |Greatrex_Lieu_2002|Refgreatrexlieu2002| , p. II, 196. and to devastate Anatolia, while the  |Avars|Avars|  and  |Slavs|Slavs|  took advantage of the situation to overrun the  |Balkans|Balkans| , bringing the Empire to the brink of destruction. In 613, the Persian army took  |Damascus|Damascus|  with the help of the  |Jews|Jew| , seized  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  in 614, damaging the  |Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre|Church_Of_The_Holy_Sepulchre|  and capturing the  |True_Cross|True_Cross| , and afterwards capturing  |Egypt|Sasanian_Conquest_Of_Egypt|  in 617 or 618.  |Gibbon_1994|Refgibbon1994| , ii.908–909. When the Sasanians reached  |Chalcedon|Chalcedon|  in 615, it was at this point, according to  |Sebeos|Sebeos| , that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was about ready to allow the Byzantine Empire to become a Persian  |client_state|Client_State| , even permitting Khosrow II to choose the emperor.  In a letter delivered by his ambassadors, Heraclius acknowledged the Persian empire as superior, described himself as Khosrow IIs obedient son, one who is eager to perform the services of your serenity in all things, and even called Khosrow II the supreme emperor.  Khosrow II nevertheless rejected the peace offer, and arrested Heraclius ambassadors.      With the Persians at the very gate of Constantinople, Heraclius thought of abandoning the city and moving the capital to Carthage, but the powerful church figure  |Patriarch_Sergius|Sergius_I_Of_Constantinople|  convinced him to stay. Safe behind the walls of Constantinople, Heraclius was able to sue for peace in exchange for an annual tribute of a thousand talents of gold, a thousand talents of silver, a thousand silk robes, a thousand horses, and a thousand virgins to the Persian King.  |Gibbon_1994|Refgibbon1994| , chap. 46, ii.914. The peace allowed him to rebuild the Empires army by slashing non-military expenditure, devaluing the currency, and melting down, with the backing of Patriarch Sergius, Church treasures to raise the necessary funds to continue the war.  |Greatrex_Lieu_2002|Refgreatrexlieu2002| , p. II, 198.       On April 5, 622, Heraclius left Constantinople, entrusting the city to Sergius and general  |Bonus|Bonus|  as regents of his son. He assembled his forces in Asia Minor, probably in  |Bithynia|Bithynia| , and, after he revived their broken morale, he launched a new counter-offensive, which took on the character of a holy war; an  |acheiropoietos|Acheiropoietos|  image of Christ was carried as a military standard.    |Theophanes_1997|Reftheophanes1997| , pp. 303.12–304.13.  |Cameron_1979|Refcameron1979| , p. 23.  |Grabar_1984|Refgrabar1984| , p. 37.          The Roman army proceeded to Armenia, inflicted a defeat on an army led by a Persian-allied Arab chief, and then won a victory over the Persians under Shahrbaraz.  |Treadgold_1997|Reftreadgold1997| , p. 294. Heraclius would stay on campaign for several years.  |Theophanes_1997|Reftheophanes1997| , pp. 304.25–306.7.  |Greatrex_Lieu_2002|Refgreatrexlieu2002| , p. II, 199. On March 25, 624 he again left Constantinople with his wife,  |Martina|Martina| , and his two children; after he celebrated  |Easter|Easter|  in Nicomedia on April 15, he campaigned in the Caucasus, winning a series of victories in Armenia against Khosrow and his generals Shahrbaraz, Shahin, and  |Shahraplakan|Shahraplakan| .  |Theophanes_1997|Reftheophanes1997| , pp. 307.19–308.25.  |Greatrex_Lieu_2002|Refgreatrexlieu2002| , pp. II, 202–205. In the same year the  |Visigoths|Visigoths|  succeeded in recapturing  |Cartagena|Cartagena_Spain| , capital of the western Byzantine province of  |Spania|Spania| , resulting in the loss of one of the few minor provinces that had been conquered by the armies of  |Justinian_I|Justinian_I| . The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, article Cartagena, p. 384. In 626 the Avars and Slavs supported by a Persian army commanded by Shahrbaraz,  |besieged_Constantinople|Siege_Of_Constantinople| , but the siege ended in failure ,  |Cameron_1979|Refcameron1979| , pp. 5–6, 20–22. while a second Persian army under Shahin suffered another crushing defeat at the hands of Heracliuss brother Theodore.          With the Persian war effort disintegrating, Heraclius was able to bring the  |Gokturks|Gokturks|  of the  |Western_Turkic_Khaganate|Western_Turkic_Khaganate| , under  |Ziebel|Ziebel| , who  |invaded_Persian_Transcaucasia|Third_Perso_Turkic_War| . Heraclius exploited divisions within the Persian Empire, keeping Shahrbaraz neutral by convincing him that Khosrow had grown jealous of him and had ordered his execution. Late in 627 he launched a winter offensive into Mesopotamia, where, despite the desertion of his Turkish allies, he defeated the Persians under  |Rhahzadh|Rhahzadh|  at the  |Battle_of_Nineveh|Battle_Of_Nineveh| .  |Treadgold_1997|Reftreadgold1997| , p. 298. Continuing south along the Tigris he sacked Khosrows great palace at  |Dastagird|Dastagird|  and was only prevented from attacking Ctesiphon by the destruction of the bridges on the Nahrawan Canal. Discredited by this series of disasters, Khosrow was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son  |Kavad_II|Kavad_Ii| , who at once sued for peace, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territories. In 629 Heraclius restored the  |True_Cross|True_Cross|  to  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  in a majestic ceremony. , passim.  |Haldon_1997|Refhaldon1997| , p. 46.     Heraclius took for himself the ancient Persian title of  |King_of_Kings|King_Of_Kings|  after his victory. Later on, starting in 629, he styled himself as  Basileus , the Greek word for sovereign , and that title was used by the Byzantine Emperors for the next 800 years. The reason Heraclius chose this title over previous Roman terms such as  |Augustus|Augustus|  has been attributed by some scholars to his  |Armenian|Armenians|  origins.  |Kouymjian_1983|Refkouymjian1983| , pp. 635–642.     Heracliuss defeat of the Persians ended a war that had been going on intermittently for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire.  |Kavad_II|Kavad_Ii|  died only months after assuming the throne, plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war.  |Ardashir_III|Ardashir_Iii| , Heracliuss ally  |Shahrbaraz|Shahrbaraz| , and Khosrows daughters  |Boran|Boran|  and  |Azarmidokht|Azarmidokht|  all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when  |Yazdgerd_III|Yazdgerd_Iii| , a grandson of Khosrow II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability. But by then the Sasanid Empire was severely disorganised, having been weakened by  |years_of_war_and_civil_strife|Sasanian_Civil_War_Of_628–632|  over the succession to the throne. .   The war had been devastating, and left the Byzantines in a much-weakened state. Within a few years both empires were overwhelmed by the onslaught of the Arabs, who had become newly united by  |Islam|Islam| , . ultimately leading to the  |Muslim_conquest_of_Persia|Muslim_Conquest_Of_Persia|  and the  |fall_of_the_Sasanian_dynasty|Fall_Of_The_Sasanian_Empire|  in 651. .                  By 629, the Islamic Prophet  |Muhammad|Muhammad|  had unified all the tribes of the  |Arabian_Peninsula|Arabian_Peninsula| , previously too divided to pose a serious military challenge to the Byzantines or the Persians. Now animated by their conversion to  |Islam|Islam| , they comprised one of the most powerful states in the region.  |Lewis_2002|Reflewis2002| , pp. 43–44. The first conflict between the Byzantines and Muslims was the  |Battle_of_Mutah|Battle_Of_Mutah|  in September 629. A small Muslim skirmishing force attacked the province of  |Arabia|Arabia_Petraea|  in response to the Muslim ambassadors death at the hands of the  |Ghassanid|Ghassanid|  Roman governor, but were repulsed. Because the engagement was a Byzantine victory, there was no apparent reason to make changes to the military organization of the region.  |Kaegi_2003|Refkaegi2003| , p. 231. Also, the Byzantines had had little battlefield experience with the Arabs, and even less with zealous soldiers united by a prophet.  |Kaegi_2003|Refkaegi2003| , p. 230. Even the  |Strategicon_of_Maurice|Strategicon_Of_Maurice| , a  |manual_of_war|Byzantine_Military_Manuals|  praised for the variety of enemies it covers, does not mention warfare against  |Arabs|Arabs|  at any length.     The following year the Muslims launched an offensive into the  |Arabah|Arabah|  south of  |Lake_Tiberias|Lake_Tiberias| , taking  |Al_Karak|Al_Karak| . Other raids penetrated into the  |Negev|Negev| , reaching as far as  |Gaza|Gaza_City| .  |Kaegi_2003|Refkaegi2003| , p. 233. The  |Battle_of_Yarmouk|Battle_Of_Yarmouk|  in 636 resulted in a crushing defeat for the larger Byzantine army; within three years, the  |Levant|Levant|  had been lost again. By the time of Heracliuss death in Constantinople, on February 11, 641, most of Egypt had fallen as well.                 Looking back at the reign of Heraclius, scholars have credited him with many accomplishments. He enlarged the Empire, and his reorganization of the government and military were great successes. His attempts at religious harmony failed, but he succeeded in returning the True Cross, one of the holiest Christian relics, to Jerusalem.       Although the territorial gains produced by his defeat of the Persians were lost to the advance of the Muslims, Heraclius still ranks among the great Roman Emperors. His reforms of the government reduced the corruption which had taken hold in Phocass reign, and he reorganized the military with great success. Ultimately, the reformed Imperial army halted the Muslims in  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  and held on to  |Carthage|Carthage|  for another 60 years, saving a core from which the empires strength could be rebuilt.  |Collins_2004|Refcollins2004| , p. 128.     The recovery of the eastern areas of the Roman Empire from the Persians once again raised the problem of religious unity centering on the understanding of the true nature of  |Christ|Christ| . Most of the inhabitants of these provinces were  |Monophysites|Monophysite|  who rejected the  |Council_of_Chalcedon|Council_Of_Chalcedon| .  |Bury_2005|Refbury2005| , p. 251. Heraclius tried to promote a compromise doctrine called  |Monothelitism|Monothelitism|  but this philosophy was rejected as  |heretical|Heresy|  by both sides of the dispute. For this reason, Heraclius was viewed as a heretic and bad ruler by some later religious writers. After the Monophysite provinces were finally lost to the Muslims, Monotheletism rather lost its raison dêtre and was eventually abandoned.     One of the most important legacies of Heraclius was changing the official language of the Empire from  |Latin|Latin|  to Greek in 620.  |Davis_1990|Refdavis1990| , p. 260. The  |Croats|Croats|  and  |Serbs|Serbs|  of  |Byzantine_Dalmatia|Byzantine_Dalmatia|  initiated diplomatic relations and dependencies with Heraclius. Kaegi, p. 319. The Serbs, who briefly lived in Macedonia, became  foederati  and were baptized at the request of Heraclius . De Administrando Imperio, ch. 32 the emperor brought elders from Rome and baptized them and taught them fairly to perform the works of piety and expounded to them the faith of the Christians. At his request,  |Pope_John_IV|Pope_John_Iv|  sent Christian teachers and missionaries to  |Duke_Porga_and_his_Croats|Porga_Of_Croatia| , who practiced  |Slavic_paganism|Slavic_Mythology| .  |Deanesly_1969|Refdeanesly1969| , p. 491. He also created the office of  |sakellarios|Sakellarios| , a comptroller of the treasury.  |Kaegi_2003|Refkaegi2003| , p. 227.     Up to the 20th century he was credited with establishing the  |Thematic_system|Theme|  but modern scholarship now points more to the 660s, under  |Constans_II|Constans_Ii| .  |Haldon_1997|Refhaldon1997| , pp. 208ff.           |Edward_Gibbon|Edward_Gibbon| , in  The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , wrote:          Heraclius was long remembered favourably by the Western church for his reputed recovery of the  |True_Cross|True_Cross|  from the Persians. As Heraclius approached the Persian capital during the final stages of the war, Khosrow fled from his favourite residence, Dastagird near  |Baghdad|Baghdad| , without offering resistance. Meanwhile, some of the Persian grandees freed Khosrows eldest son  |Kavad_II|Kavad_Ii| , who had been imprisoned by his father, and proclaimed him King on the night of February 23–24, 628.  |Thomson_1999|Refthomson1999| , p. 221. Kavad, however, was mortally ill and was anxious that Heraclius should protect his infant son Ardeshir. So, as a goodwill gesture, he sent the True Cross with a negotiator in 628. .     After a tour of the Empire, Heraclius returned the cross to  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  on March 21, 629 or 630. For Christians of Western Medieval Europe, Heraclius was the first crusader . The iconography of the emperor appeared in the sanctuary at Mont Saint-Michel , . and then it became popular, especially in France, the Italian Peninsula, and the Holy Roman Empire. . The story was included in the  Golden Legend , the famous 13th-century compendium of hagiography, and he is sometimes shown in art, as in  The History of the True Cross  sequence of  |fresco|Fresco| es painted by  |Piero_della_Francesca|Piero_Della_Francesca|  in  |Arezzo|Arezzo| , and a similar sequence on a small altarpiece by  |Adam_Elsheimer|Adam_Elsheimer|  . Both of these show scenes of Heraclius and  |Constantine_Is|Constantine_I|  mother  |Saint_Helena|Helena_Of_Constantinople| , traditionally responsible for the excavation of the cross. The scene usually shown is Heraclius carrying the cross; according to the Golden Legend, he insisted on doing this as he entered Jerusalem, against the advice of the Patriarch. At first, when he was on horseback , the burden was too heavy, but after he dismounted and removed his crown it became miraculously light, and the barred city gate opened of its own accord.     Probably because he was one of the few Eastern Roman Emperors widely known in the West, the  |Late_Antique|Late_Antiquity| |_Colossus_of_Barletta|Colossus_Of_Barletta|  was considered to depict Heraclius.     Some scholars disagree with this narrative, Professor  |Constantin_Zuckerman|Constantine_Zuckerman|  going as far as to suggest that the True Cross was actually lost, and that the wood contained in the allegedly-still-sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake. In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, the Persian general  |Shahrbaraz|Shahrbaraz| .           In  |Surah_30|Ar_Rum| , the Quran refers to the Roman-Sasanian wars as follows:     30:2 The Romans have been defeated 3 In the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome. 4 Within several years.      In Islamic and Arab histories Heraclius is the only Roman Emperor who is discussed at any length.  |El_Cheikh_1999|Refelcheikh1999| , p. 7. Owing to his role as the Roman Emperor at the time Islam emerged, he was remembered in  |Arabic_literature|Arabic_Literature| , such as the Islamic  |hadith|Hadith|  and  |sira|Prophetic_Biography| .     The  |Swahili|Swahili_Language|   Utendi wa Tambuka , an  |epic_poem|Epic_Poem|  composed in 1728 at  |Pate|Pate_Islandpate_Town|  Island  and depicting the wars between the Muslims and Byzantines from the formers point of view, is also known as Kyuo kya Hereḳali . In that work, Heraclius is portrayed as declining the Prophets request to renounce his belief in Christianity; he is therefore defeated by the Muslim forces.   at the Swahili Manuscripts Project at the  |School_of_Oriental_and_African_Studies|School_Of_Oriental_And_African_Studies|  of London.     In Muslim tradition he is seen as a just ruler of great piety, who had direct contact with the emerging Islamic forces.  |El_Cheikh_1999|Refelcheikh1999| , p. 9. The 14th-century scholar  |Ibn_Kathir|Ibn_Kathir|  went even further, stating that Heraclius was one of the wisest men and among the most resolute, shrewd, deep and opinionated of kings. He ruled the Romans with great leadership and splendor. Historians such as Nadia Maria El-Cheikh and Lawrence Conrad note that Islamic histories even go so far as claiming that Heraclius recognized Islam as the true faith and  |Muhammad|Muhammad|  as its prophet, by comparing Islam to Christianity.  |El_Cheikh_1999|Refelcheikh1999| , p. 12. . .     Islamic historians often cite a letter that they claim Heraclius wrote to Muhammad: I have received your letter with your ambassador and I testify that you are the messenger of God found in our New Testament. Jesus, son of Mary, announced you. According to the Muslim sources reported by El-Cheikh, he tried to convert the ruling class of the Empire, but they resisted so strongly that he reversed his course and claimed that he was just testing their faith in Christianity.  |El_Cheikh_1999|Refelcheikh1999| , p. 14. El-Cheikh notes that these accounts of Heraclius add little to our historical knowledge of the emperor; rather, they are an important part of Islamic  |kerygma|Kerygma| , attempting to legitimize Muhammads status as a prophet.  |El_Cheikh_1999|Refelcheikh1999| , p. 54.     Most scholarly historians view such traditions as profoundly kerygmatic and that enormous difficulties exist in using these sources for actual history. Lawrence I. Conrad. Heraclius in Early Islamic Kerygma Edited by Reinink and Stolte. Furthermore, they argue that any messengers sent by Muhammad to Heraclius would not have received an imperial audience or recognition.  Outside of Islamic sources there is no evidence to suggest Heraclius ever heard of Islam.  |Kaegi_2003|Refkaegi2003| , p. 229. and it is possible that he and his advisors actually viewed the Muslims as some special sect of Jews.          Heraclius was married twice: first to  |Fabia_Eudokia|Fabia_Eudokia| , a daughter of Rogatus, and then to his niece  |Martina|Martina| . He had two children with Fabia  and at least nine with Martina, most of whom were sickly children.  |Bellinger_Grierson_1992|Refbellingergrierson1992| , p. 385. Of Martinas children at least two were  |disabled|Disability| , which was seen as punishment for the illegality of the marriage: Fabius had a  |paralyzed|Paralysis|  neck and Theodosios was a  |deaf_mute|Deaf_Mute| . The latter married Nike, daughter of the Persian general  |Shahrbaraz|Shahrbaraz| , or daughter of Niketas, cousin of Heraclius.     Two of Heracliuss children would become Emperor:  |Heraclius_Constantine_|Constantine_Iii| , his son from Eudokia, for four months in 641, and Martinas son  |Constantine_Heraclius_|Heraklonas| , in 638–641.
