Corum Jhaelen Irsei is the name of a  |fictional|Fictional|  fantasy hero in a series of two trilogies written by author  |Michael_Moorcock|Michael_Moorcock| .       Corum is the last survivor of the Vadhagh race and an incarnation aspect of the  |Eternal_Champion|Eternal_Champion| , a being that exists in all worlds to ensure there is  |Cosmic_Balance|Law_And_Chaosthe_Cosmic_Balance|  .       The Swords TrilogyThe Knight of the Swords , The Queen of the Swords , and The King of the Swords . In the United Kingdom it has been collected as an omnibus edition titled Corum, Swords of Corum and most recently Corum: The Prince in the Scarlet Robe . In the United States the first trilogy has been published as Corum: The Coming of Chaos.       Corum is a Vadhagh, one of a race of long-lived beings with limited magical abilities dedicated to peaceful pursuits such as art and poetry. A group of Mabden led by the savage Earl Glandyth-a-Krae raid the family castle and slaughter everyone with the exception of Corum, who escapes. Arming himself, Corum attacks and kills several of the Mabden before being captured and tortured. After having his left hand cut off and right eye put out, Corum escapes by moving into another plane of existence, becoming invisible to the Mabden. They depart and Corum is found by The Brown Man, a dweller of the forest of Laar able to see Corum while out of phase. The Brown Man takes Corum to a being called Arkyn, who treats his wounds and explains he has a higher purpose.     Travelling to Moidels Castle, Corum encounters his future lover, the Margravine Rhalina, a mabden woman of the civilized land of Lwym an Esh. Having found out Corums location by torturing and killing the Brown Man of Laar, Glandyth-a-Krae marshalled his allies to Moidels Castle. Glandyth had kept Corums former hand and eye as souvenirs, and showed them to Corum to provoke a reaction. Rhalina uses sorcery to ward off an attack by Glandyth-a-Krae. Determined to restore himself, Corum and Rhalina travel to the island of Shool, a near immortal and mad sorcerer. During the journey Corum observes a mysterious giant who trawls the ocean with a net. On arrival at the island Shool takes Rhalina hostage, and then provides Corum with two  |artifacts|Magic_Item|  to replace his lost hand and eye: the Hand of Kwll and the Eye of Rhynn. The Eye of Rhynn allows Corum to see into an undead netherworld where the last beings killed by Corum exist until summoned by the Hand of Kwll.     Shool then explains that Corums ill fortune has been caused by the Chaos God  |Arioch|Arioch| , the Knight of the Swords. When Arioch and his fellow Chaos Lords conquered the Fifteen Planes, the balance between the forces of  |Law_and_Chaos|Law_And_Chaos|  tipped in favor of Chaos, and their minions - such as Glandyth-a-Krae - embarked on a bloody rampage. Shool sends Corum to Ariochs fortress to steal the Heart of Arioch, which the sorcerer intends to use to attain greater power. Corum confronts Arioch, and learns Shool is nothing more than a pawn of the Chaos God. Arioch then ignores Corum, who discovers the location of the Heart. Corum is then attacked by Arioch, but the Hand of Kwll crushes the Heart and banishes the Chaos God forever. Before fading from existence, Arioch warns Corum that he has now earned the enmity of the Sword Rulers. Corum returns to the island to rescue Rhalina, and observes Shool has become a powerless moron, and is devoured by his own creations soon afterwards. Corum learns Arkyn is in fact a Lord of Law, and that this is the first step towards Law regaining control of the Fifteen Planes.     On another five planes, the forces of Chaos - led by Xiombarg, Queen of the Swords - reign supreme and are on the verge on eradicating the last resistance from the forces of Law. The  |avatars|Avatar|  of the Bear and Dog gods plot with Earl Glandyth-a-Krae to murder Corum and return Arioch to the Fifteen Planes. Guided by Arkyn, Corum, Rhalina and companion Jhary-a-Conel cross the planes and encounter the King Without A Country, the last of his people who in turn is seeking the City in the Pyramid. The group locate the City, which is in fact a floating arsenal powered by advanced technology and inhabited by a people originally from Corums world and his distant kin.     Besieged by the forces of Chaos, the City requires certain rare minerals to continue to power their weapons. Corum and Jhary attempt to locate the minerals and also encounter Xiombarg, who learns of Corums identity. Corum slows Xiombargs forces by defeating their leader, Prince Gaynor the Damned. Xiombarg is goaded into attacking the City directly in revenge for Ariochs banishment. Arkyn provides the minerals and confronts Xiombarg, who has manifested in a vulnerable state. As Arkyn banishes Xiombarg, Corum and his allies devastate the forces of Chaos. Glandyth-a-Krae, however, escapes, and seeks revenge.     A spell - determined to have been cast by the forces of Chaos - forces the inhabitants of Corums plane to war with each other . Desperate to stop the slaughter, Corum, Rhalina and Jhary-a-Conel travel to the last five planes, ruled by Mabelode, the King of the Swords. Rhalina is taken hostage by the forces of Chaos and Corum has several encounters with the forces of Chaos, including Earl Glandyth-a-Krae.     Corum also meets two other aspects of the Eternal Champion:  |Elric|Elric|  and  |Erekosë|Erekosë| , with all three seeking the mystical city of  |Tanelorn|Tanelorn|  for their own purposes. After a brief adventure in the Vanishing Tower , the other heroes depart and Corum and Jhary arrive at their version of Tanelorn. Corum discovers one of the Lost Gods , the being Kwll, who is imprisoned and cannot be freed until whole. Corum offers Kwll his hand, on the condition that he aid them against Mabelode. Kwll accepts the terms, but reneges on the bargain until persuaded to assist. Corum is also stripped of his artificial eye, which belongs to Rhynn - actually the mysterious giant Corum had previously encountered. Kwll transports Corum and Jhary to the court of Mabelode, with the pair fleeing with Rhalina when Kwll directly challenges the Chaos God.     In a final battle Corum avenged his family by killing Glandyth-a-Krae and decimating the last of Chaos mortal forces. Kwll later located Corum and revealed that all the gods - of both Chaos and Law - have been slain in order to free humanity and allow it to shape its own destiny.     The Silver Hand TrilogyThe Bull and the Spear , The Oak and the Ram , and The Sword and the Stallion . It was titled The Prince with the Silver Hand in the United Kingdom and The Chronicles of Corum in the United States respectively. The previous trilogy hinted at a  |Celtic|Celts|  or proto-Celtic setting for the stories - the terms mabden and shefanhow occurring in these books are both  |Cornish_language|Cornish_Language|  words. The Silver Hand trilogy is more explicit in its Celtic connections, with overt borrowings from Celtic mythology.       Set eighty years after the defeat of the Sword Rulers, Corum has become despondent and alone since the death of his Mabden bride Rhalina. Plagued by voices at night, Corum believes he has gone insane until old friend  |Jhary_a_Conel|Jhary_A_Conel|  advises Corum it is in fact a summons from another world. Listening to the voices allows Corum to pass to the other world, which is in fact the distant future. The descendants of Rhalinas folk, the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich , who call Corum Corum Llew Ereint , face extinction by the Fhoi Myore . The Fhoi Myore, seven powerful but diseased and barely sentient giants, with the aid of their allies have conquered the land and plunged it into eternal winter. Allying himself with King Mannach, ruler of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich, Corum falls in love with his daughter Medhbh .     Corum also hears the prophecy of a  |seeress|Prophet| , who claims Corum should fear a brother , a harp and above all, beauty. Corum seeks the lost artifacts of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich - a sacred Bull, a spear, an oak, a ram, a sword and a stallion - which will restore the land. Corum gains new allies,  |Goffanon|Gofannon|   and Goffanons cousin and true giant Illbrec. They battle the Fhoi Myore, who themselves have allies: a returned Prince Gaynor, the wizard Calatin and his  |clone|Cloning|  of Corum, the Brothers of the Pine, the undead Ghoolegh and a host of giant  |demonic_dogs|Cŵn_Annwn| . After being instrumental in the death of two of the Fhoi Myore and restoring to his senses the enscorceled  |Amergin|Amergin_Glúingel| , the High King and Chief Druid of the Tuha-na-Cremm Croich, Corum and his allies fight a final battle in which all their foes are destroyed.     Corum decides not to return his own world, and is attacked by his clone, whom he defeats with the aid of a spell placed on his silver hand by Medhbh. Medhbh, however, attacks and wounds Corum, having been told by the being the  |Dagdah|The_Dagda|  that their world must be free of all gods and demi-gods if they are to flourish as a people. Corum is then killed with his own sword by his animated silver hand, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.
