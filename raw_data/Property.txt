        Property, in the  |abstract|Abstract_And_Concrete| , is what belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In the context of this article, it is one or more components , whether  |physical|Tangible_Property|  or  |incorporeal|Intangible_Property| , of a persons  |estate|Estate| ; or so belonging to, as in being  |owned|Ownership|  by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a  |corporation|Corporation|  or even a  |society|Society| . Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to  |consume|Consumable| , alter,  |share,_redefine|Easement| ,  |rent|Renting| ,  |mortgage|Mortgage_Law| ,  |pawn|Collateral| ,  |sell|Sales| ,  |exchange|Barter| ,  |transfer|Transfer_Payment| ,  |give_away|Gift|  or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things,    as well as to perhaps  |abandon|Lost,_Mislaid,_And_Abandoned_Property|  it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it , or at the very least exclusively keep it.     In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property:  |private_property|Private_Property| ,  |public_property|Public_Property| , and  |collective_property|Collective_Property|  .      Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each partys will with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be  |unanimous|Unanimity| , or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute.     The  |Restatement|Restatements_Of_The_Law|  of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.      In  |sociology|Sociology|  and  |anthropology|Anthropology| , property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between collective property and private property is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.  |Graeber|Graeber| , New York: Palgrave Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams.  ... one might argue that property is a social relation as well, reified in exactly the same way: when one buys a car one is not really purchasing the right to use it so much as the right to prevent others from using it-or, to be even more precise, one is purchasing their recognition that one has the right to do so. But since it is so diffuse a social relation- a contract, in effect, between the owner and everyone else in the entire world-it is easy to think of it as a thing... Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, Property in Anthropology,      Important widely recognized types of property include  |real_property|Realty|  ,  |personal_property|Personal_Property|  , private property , public property and  |intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property|  , although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced.  |Anti-copyright|Anti-Copyright|  advocates and other  |critics_of_intellectual_property|Criticism_Of_Intellectual_Property|  dispute the concept of intellectual property.. An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A  |title|Title| , or a  |right|Right|  of  |ownership|Ownership| , establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.         Often property is defined by the code of the local  |sovereignty|Sovereignty| , and protected wholly or more usually partially by such entity, the owner being responsible for any remainder of protection. The  |standards_of_proof|Standard_Of_Proof|  concerning proofs of ownerships are also addressed by the code of the local sovereignty, and such entity plays a role accordingly, typically  |somewhat_managerial|Recorder_Of_Deeds| . Some philosophers assert that property  |rights|Rights|  arise from  |social_convention|Convention| , while others find justifications for them in  |morality|Morality|  or in  |natural_law|Natural_Law| .     Various scholarly disciplines  may treat the concept more systematically, but definitions vary, most particularly when involving  |contracts|Contract| .  |Positive_law|Positive_Law|  defines such rights, and the  |judiciary|Judiciary|  can adjudicate and enforce property rights.     According to  |Adam_Smith|Adam_Smith| , the expectation of profit from improving ones stock of capital rests on private property rights.   |Capitalism|Capitalism|  has as a central assumption that property rights encourage their holders to develop the property, generate  |wealth|Wealth| , and efficiently allocate  |resources|Factors_Of_Production|  based on the operation of markets. From this has evolved the modern conception of property as a right enforced by positive law, in the expectation that this will produce more wealth and better standards of living. However, Smith also expressed a very critical view on the effects of property laws on inequality:     :: Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality … Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.       In his text The Common Law,  |Oliver_Wendell_Holmes|Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Jr.|  describes property as having two fundamental aspects. The first, possession, can be defined as control over a resource based on the practical inability of another to contradict the ends of the possessor. The second, title, is the expectation that others will recognize rights to control resource, even when it is not in possession. He elaborates the differences between these two concepts, and proposes a history of how they came to be attached to persons, as opposed to families or to entities such as the church.    |Classical_liberalism|Classical_Liberalism|  subscribes to the  |labor_theory_of_property|Labor_Theory_Of_Property| . They hold that individuals each own their own life, it follows that one must own the products of that life, and that those products can be traded in free exchange with others.     :: Every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has a right to, but himself.      :: The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property.      :: Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.     |Conservatism|Conservatism|  subscribes to the concept that freedom and property are closely linked. That the more widespread the possession of private property, the more stable and productive is a state or nation. Economic leveling of property, conservatives maintain, especially of the forced kind, is not economic progress.     :: Separate property from private possession, and Leviathan becomes master of all... Upon the foundation of private property, great civilizations are built... The conservative acknowledges that the possession of property fixes certain duties upon the possessor; he accepts those moral and legal obligations cheerfully.     |Socialisms|Socialism|  fundamental principles center on a critique of this concept, stating that the cost of defending property exceeds the returns from private property ownership, and that, even when property rights encourage their holders to develop their property or generate wealth, they do so only for their own benefit, which may not coincide with benefit to other people or to society at large.    |Libertarian_socialism|Libertarian_Socialism|  generally accepts property rights, but with a short abandonment period. In other words, a person must make continuous use of the item or else lose ownership rights. This is usually referred to as possession property or  |usufruct|Usufruct|  . Thus, in this usufruct system, absentee ownership is illegitimate and workers own the machines or other equipment that they work with.    |Communism|Communism|  argues that only collective ownership of the  |means_of_production|Means_Of_Production|  through a  |polity|Body_Politic|   will assure the minimization of unequal or unjust outcomes and the maximization of benefits, and that therefore humans should abolish private ownership of  |capital|Capital|  .     Both communism and some kinds of socialism have also upheld the notion that private ownership of capital is inherently illegitimate. This argument centers mainly on the idea that private ownership of capital always benefits one  |class|Social_Class|  over another, giving rise to domination through the use of this privately owned capital. Communists do not oppose personal property that is hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned  by members of the  |proletariat|Proletariat| . Both socialism and communism distinguish carefully between private ownership of capital and private property .       Most  |legal_systems|Legal_System|  distinguish between different types of property, especially between land  and all other forms of property—goods and  |chattels|Personal_Property| ,  |movable_property|Movable_Property|  or  |personal_property|Personal_Property| , including the  |value_of_legal_tender|Face_Value|  if not the  |legal_tender_itself|Legal_Tender| , as the  |manufacturer|Currencycontrol_And_Production|  rather than the possessor might be the owner. They often distinguish  |tangible|Tangible_Property|  and  |intangible_property|Intangible_Property| . One categorization scheme specifies three species of property: land, improvements , and personal property .     In  |common_law|Common_Law| ,  |real_property|Real_Property|   is the combination of  |interests|Rights|  in land and improvements thereto, and  |personal_property|Personal_Property|  is interest in movable property. Real property rights are rights relating to the land. These rights include ownership and usage. Owners can grant rights to persons and entities in the form of  |leases|Lease| ,  |licenses|License|  and  |easements|Easement| .     Throughout the last centuries of the  |second_millennium|2Nd_Millennium| , with the development of more complex theories of property, the concept of personal property had become divided into tangible property  and intangible property .     Treatment of intangible property is such that an article of property is, by law or otherwise by traditional conceptualization, subject to expiration even when  |inheritable|Inheritance| , which is a key distinction from tangible property. Upon expiration, the property, if of the intellectual category, becomes a part of  |public_domain|Public_Domain| , to be used by but not owned by anybody, and possibly used by more than one party simultaneously due the inapplicability of  |scarcity|Scarcity|  to intellectual property. Whereas things such as communications channels and pairs of electromagnetic spectrum band and signal transmission power can only be used by a single party at a time, or a single party in a divisible context, if owned or used at all. Thus far or usually those are not considered property, or at least not private property, even though the party bearing right of exclusive use may transfer that right to another.     In many societies the  |human_body|Human_Body|  is considered property of some kind or other. The question of the ownership and rights to ones body arise in general in the discussion of  |human_rights|Human_Rights| , including the specific issues of  |slavery|Slavery| ,  |conscription|Conscription| , rights of children under the  |age_of_majority|Age_Of_Majority| ,  |marriage|Marriage| ,  |abortion|Abortion| ,  |prostitution|Prostitution| ,  |drugs|Drugs| ,  |euthanasia|Euthanasia|  and  |organ_donation|Organ_Donation| .            Of the following, only sale and at-will sharing involve no  |encumbrance|Encumbrance| .                                  The two major justifications given for original property, or the  |homestead_principle|Homestead_Principle| , are effort and scarcity.  |John_Locke|John_Locke|  emphasized effort, mixing your labor  with an object, or clearing and cultivating virgin land.  |Benjamin_Tucker|Benjamin_Tucker|  preferred to look at the  |telos|Telos|  of property, i.e. What is the purpose of property? His answer: to solve the scarcity problem. Only when items are relatively scarce with respect to peoples desires do they become property.  For example, hunter-gatherers did not consider land to be property, since there was no shortage of land. Agrarian societies later made arable land property, as it was scarce. For something to be economically scarce it must necessarily have the exclusivity property—that use by one person excludes others from using it. These two justifications lead to different conclusions on what can be property.  |Intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property| —incorporeal things like ideas, plans, orderings and arrangements —are generally considered valid property to those who support an effort justification, but invalid to those who support a scarcity justification, since the things dont have the exclusivity property . Thus even ardent  |propertarians|Propertarian|  may disagree about IP.  By either standard, ones body is ones property.     From some  |anarchist|Anarchism|  points of view, the validity of property depends on whether the property right requires enforcement by the state. Different forms of property require different amounts of enforcement:  |intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property|  requires a great deal of state intervention to enforce, ownership of distant physical property requires quite a lot, ownership of carried objects requires very little, while ownership of ones own body requires absolutely no state intervention. Some anarchists dont believe in property at all.     Many things have existed that did not have an  |owner|Owner| , sometimes called the  |commons|Commons| . The term commons, however, is also often used to mean something quite different: general collective ownership —i.e.  |common_ownership|Common_Ownership| . Also, the same term is sometimes used by  |statists|Statism|  to mean government-owned property that the general public is allowed to access . Law in all societies has tended to develop towards reducing the number of things not having clear owners. Supporters of property rights argue that this enables better protection of scarce resources, due to the  |tragedy_of_the_commons|Tragedy_Of_The_Commons| , while critics argue that it leads to the exploitation of those resources for personal gain and that it hinders taking advantage of potential  |network_effects|Network_Effects| . These arguments have differing validity for different types of property —things that are not scarce are, for instance, not subject to the  |tragedy_of_the_commons|Tragedy_Of_The_Commons| . Some apparent critics advocate general collective ownership rather than ownerlessness.     Things that do not have owners include:  |ideas|Idea|  ,  |seawater|Seawater|  , parts of the  |seafloor|Seafloor|  , gases in  |Earths_atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere| , animals in the wild , celestial bodies and outer space, and land in  |Antarctica|Antarctica| .     The nature of children under the  |age_of_majority|Age_Of_Majority|  is another contested issue here. In ancient societies children were generally considered the property of their parents. Children in most modern societies theoretically own their own bodies but are not considered competent to exercise their rights, and their parents or  |guardians|Legal_Guardian|  are given most of the actual rights of control over them.     Questions regarding the nature of ownership of the body also come up in the issue of  |abortion|Abortion| ,  |drugs|Drugs|  and  |euthanasia|Euthanasia| .     In many ancient legal systems , religious sites  were considered property of the  |God|God|  or gods they were devoted to. However,  |religious_pluralism|Religious_Pluralism|  makes it more convenient to have religious sites owned by the  |religious_body|Religious_Body|  that runs them.      |Intellectual_property|Intellectual_Property|  and air  can be property in some senses of the word.     Ownership of land can be held separately from the ownership of rights over that land, including sporting rights,   |mineral_rights|Mineral_Rights| , development rights,  |air_rights|Air_Rights| , and such other rights as may be worth segregating from simple land ownership.          Ownership laws may vary widely among countries depending on the nature of the property of interest . Persons can own property directly. In most societies  |legal_entities|Juristic_Person| , such as  |corporations|Corporations| ,  |trusts|Trust_Law|  and nations own property.     In many countries women have limited access to property following restrictive inheritance and family laws, under which only men have actual or formal rights to own property.     In the Inca empire, the dead emperors, who were considered gods, still controlled property after death. Mckay, John P. , 2004, A History of World Societes . Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company       In 17th-century England, the legal directive that nobody may enter a home, which in the 17th-century would typically have been male owned, unless by the owners invitation or consent, was established as common law in Sir  |Edward_Coke|Edward_Coke| ’s  Institutes of the Lawes of England . For a mans house is his castle, et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium It is the origin of the famous dictum, “an Englishman’s home is his castle”.  The ruling enshrined into law what several English writers had espoused in the 16th-century. Unlike the rest of Europe the British had a proclivity towards owning their own homes. British Prime Minister  |William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham|William_Pitt,_1St_Earl_Of_Chatham|  defined the meaning of castle in 1763, The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the crown. It may be frail – its roof may shake – the wind may blow through it – the storm may enter – the rain may enter – but the King of England cannot enter.     A principle exported to the United States, under U.S. law the principal limitations on whether and the extent to which the State may interfere with property rights are set by the Constitution. The Takings clause requires that the government may take private property only for a public purpose, after exercising due process of law, and upon making just compensation. If an interest is not deemed a property right or the conduct is merely an intentional tort, these limitations do not apply and the doctrine of  |sovereign_immunity|Sovereign_Immunity|  precludes relief. See, for example,  United States v. Willow River Power Co.  ;  Schillinger v. United States , 155 U.S. 163 ; Zoltek Corp. v. United States, 442 F.3d 1345 . Moreover, if the interference does not almost completely make the property valueless, the interference will not be deemed a taking but instead a mere regulation of use. Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 . On the other hand, some governmental regulations of property use have been deemed so severe that they have been considered  |regulatory_takings|Regulatory_Taking| . See United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, 474 U.S. 121 . Moreover, conduct sometimes deemed only a nuisance or other tort has been held a taking of property where the conduct was sufficiently persistent and severe. United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 .         There exist many theories of property. One is the relatively rare  |first_possession_theory_of_property|First_Possession_Theory_Of_Property| , where ownership of something is seen as justified simply by someone seizing something before someone else does. Property . Graham Oppy. The shorter Routledge encyclopedia of philosophy. Editor  |Edward_Craig|Edward_Craig| . Routledge, 2005, p. 858 Perhaps one of the most popular is the  |natural_rights|Natural_Rights|  definition of property rights as advanced by  |John_Locke|John_Locke| . Locke advanced the theory that God granted dominion over nature to man through Adam in the book of Genesis. Therefore, he theorized that when one mixes ones labor with nature, one gains a relationship with that part of nature with which the labor is mixed, subject to the limitation that there should be enough, and as good, left in common for others.       From the RERUM NOVARUM,  |Pope_Leo_XIII|Pope_Leo_Xiii|  wrote It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor, the impelling reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and thereafter to hold it as his very own.     Anthropology studies the diverse systems of ownership, rights of use and transfer, and possession Hann, Chris http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?titleanthropology & titletypetka & yearfrom1998 & yearto2007 & database1 & pageSize20 & index14 A new double movement? Anthropological perspectives on property in the age of neoliberalism Socio-Economic Review, Volume 5, Number 2, April 2007, pp. 287–318 under the term theories of property. Western legal theory is based, as mentioned, on the owner of property being a legal person. However, not all property systems are founded on this basis.     In every culture studied ownership and possession are the subject of custom and regulation, and law where the term can meaningfully be applied. Many tribal cultures balance individual ownership with the laws of collective groups: tribes, families, associations and nations. For example, the 1839 Cherokee Constitution frames the issue in these terms:          Communal property systems describe ownership as belonging to the entire social and political unit. Such arrangements can under certain conditions erode open access resources. This development has been critiqued by the  |tragedy_of_the_commons|Tragedy_Of_The_Commons| .     Corporate systems describe ownership as being attached to an identifiable group with an identifiable responsible individual. The Roman property law was based on such a corporate system. In a well-known paper that contributed to the creation of the field of  |law_and_economics|Law_And_Economics|  in the late 1960s, the American scholar  |Harold_Demsetz|Harold_Demsetz|  described how the concept of property rights makes social interactions easier:          Different societies may have different theories of property for differing types of ownership.  |Pauline_Peters|Pauline_Peters|  argued that property systems are not isolable from the social fabric, and notions of property may not be stated as such, but instead may be framed in negative terms: for example the taboo system among Polynesian peoples.       In  |medieval|Medieval|  and  |Renaissance|Renaissance| |Europe|Europe|  the term property essentially referred to land. After much rethinking, land has come to be regarded as only a special case of the property genus. This rethinking was inspired by at least three broad features of early modern Europe: the surge of commerce, the breakdown of efforts to prohibit  |interest|Interest|  , and the development of centralized national  |monarchies|Monarchy| .        |Urukagina|Urukagina| , the king of the  |Sumer|Sumer| ian city-state  |Lagash|Lagash| , established the first laws that forbade compelling the sale of property.  |Samuel_Noah_Kramer|Samuel_Noah_Kramer| . From the Tablets of Sumer: Twenty-Five Firsts in Mans Recorded History. Indian Hills: The Falcons Wing Press, 1956.     The  |Ten_Commandments|Ten_Commandments|  shown in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 stated that the  |Israelites|Israelites|  were not to steal, but the connection between Bronze Age concepts of theft and modern concepts of property is suspect.      |Aristotle|Aristotle| , in Politics, advocates private property.   He argues that self-interest leads to neglect of the commons. at which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an individual.  This bears some similarities to the over-use argument of Garrett Hardins  |Tragedy_of_the_Commons|Tragedy_Of_The_Commons|  .     In addition he says that when property is common, there are natural problems that arise due to differences in labor: If they do not share equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will necessarily complain of those who labor little and receive or consume much. But indeed there is always a difficulty in men living together and having all human relations in common, but especially in their having common property.       |Cicero|Cicero|  held that there is no private property under  |natural_law|Natural_Law|  but only under  |human_law|Human_Law| .  citing Cicero,  |De_officiis|De_Officiis| , i. 7, Sunt autem privata nulla natura .  |Seneca|Seneca_The_Younger|  viewed property as only becoming necessary when men become avarice.  citing Seneca, Epistles, xiv, 2.  |St._Ambrose|St._Ambrose|  later adopted this view and  |St._Augustine|St._Augustine|  even derided heretics for complaining the Emperor could not confiscate property they had labored for.            The canon law  Decretum Gratiani  maintained that mere human law creates property, repeating the phrases used by St. Augustine.  citing Decretum, D. viii. Part I.  |St._Thomas_Aquinas|St._Thomas_Aquinas|  agreed with regard to the private consumption of property but modified patristic theory in finding that the private possession of property is necessary.  Thomas Aquinas concludes that, given certain detailed provisions,    it is natural for man to possess external things   it is lawful for a man to possess a thing as his own   the essence of theft consists in taking anothers thing secretly   theft and robbery are sins of different species, and robbery is a more grievous sin than theft   theft is a sin; it is also a  |mortal_sin|Mortal_Sin|   in cases of need all things are common property.            The principal writings of  |Thomas_Hobbes|Thomas_Hobbes|  appeared between 1640 and 1651—during and immediately following  |the_war_between_forces|First_English_Civil_War|  loyal to King  |Charles_I|Charles_I_Of_England|  and those loyal to  |Parliament|Parliament| . In his own words, Hobbes reflection began with the idea of giving to every man his own, a phrase he drew from the writings of  |Cicero|Cicero| . But he wondered: How can anybody call anything his own? He concluded: My own can only truly be mine if there is one unambiguously strongest power in the realm, and that power treats it as mine, protecting its status as such. The Origin of Property . Anti Essays. 27 May 2012,          A contemporary of Hobbes,  |James_Harrington|James_Harrington| , reacted to the same tumult in a different way: he considered property natural but not inevitable. The author of  Oceana , he may have been the first political theorist to postulate that political power is a consequence, not the cause, of the distribution of property. He said that the worst possible situation is one in which the commoners have half a nations property, with crown and nobility holding the other half—a circumstance fraught with instability and violence. A much better situation will exist once the commoners own most property, he suggested.     In later years, the ranks of Harringtons admirers included American revolutionary and founder  |John_Adams|John_Adams| .         Another member of the Hobbes/Harrington generation, Sir  |Robert_Filmer|Robert_Filmer| , reached conclusions much like Hobbes, but through  |Biblical|Biblical| |exegesis|Exegesis| . Filmer said that the institution of kingship is analogous to that of fatherhood, that subjects are but children, whether obedient or unruly, and that property rights are akin to the household goods that a father may dole out among his children—his to take back and dispose of according to his pleasure.         In the following generation,  |John_Locke|John_Locke|  sought to answer Filmer, creating a rationale for a balanced  |constitution|Constitution|  in which the monarch had a part to play, but not an overwhelming part. Since Filmers views essentially require that the  |Stuart|House_Of_Stuart|  family be uniquely descended from the  |patriarchs|Patriarchs|  of the  |Bible|Bible| , and since even in the late 17th century that was a difficult view to uphold, Locke attacked Filmers views in his  |First_Treatise_on_Government|Two_Treatises_Of_Governmentfirst_Treatise| , freeing him to set out his own views in the  |Second_Treatise_on_Civil_Government|Second_Treatise_On_Civil_Government| . Therein, Locke imagined a pre-social world, each of the unhappy residents of which are willing to create a  |social_contract|Social_Contract|  because otherwise the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure, and therefore the great and chief end, therefore, of mens uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property. John Locke, The Second Treatise of Civil Government , Chap. IX, §§  123–124. They would, he allowed, create a  |monarchy|Monarchy| , but its task would be to execute the will of an elected legislature. To this end , he wrote, it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into, and the community put the  |legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the  |state_of_nature|State_Of_Nature| . John Locke, The Second Treatise of Civil Government , Chap. XI, §  136.     Even when it keeps to proper legislative form, though, Locke held that there are limits to what a government established by such a contract might rightly do.     It cannot be supposed that they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrates hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them; this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases... John Locke, The Second Treatise of Civil Government , Chap. XI, §  137.     Note that both persons and estates are to be protected from the arbitrary power of any magistrate, inclusive of the power and will of a legislator. In Lockean terms, depredations against an estate are just as plausible a justification for resistance and revolution as are those against persons. In neither case are subjects required to allow themselves to become prey.     To explain the ownership of property Locke advanced a  |labor_theory_of_property|Labor_Theory_Of_Property| .         In contrast to the figures discussed in this section thus far  |David_Hume|David_Hume|  lived a relatively quiet life that had settled down to a relatively stable social and political structure. He lived the life of a solitary writer until 1763 when, at 52 years of age, he went off to  |Paris|Paris|  to work at the British embassy.     In contrast, one might think, to his polemical works on  |religion|Religion|  and his  |empiricism|Empiricism| -driven  |skeptical|Philosophical_Skepticism| |epistemology|Epistemology| , Humes views on law and property were quite conservative.     He did not believe in hypothetical contracts, or in the love of mankind in general, and sought to ground politics upon actual human beings as one knows them. In general, he wrote, it may be affirmed that there is no such passion in human mind, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, or services, or of relation to ourselves. Existing customs should not lightly be disregarded, because they have come to be what they are as a result of human nature. With this endorsement of custom comes an endorsement of existing governments, because he conceived of the two as complementary: A regard for  |liberty|Liberty| , though a laudable passion, ought commonly to be subordinate to a reverence for established  |government|Government| .     Therefore, Humes view was that there are property rights because of and to the extent that the existing law, supported by social customs, secure them. This view is reflected in the opinion of the  |United_States_Supreme_Court|United_States_Supreme_Court|  in  United States v. Willow River Power Co. . He offered some practical home-spun advice on the general subject, though, as when he referred to  |avarice|Avarice|  as the spur of  |industry|Industry| , and expressed concern about excessive levels of taxation, which destroy industry, by engendering despair.            The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive.   —      By the mid 19th century, the industrial revolution had transformed England and the United States, and had begun in France. The established conception of what constitutes property expanded beyond land to encompass scarce goods in general. In France, the revolution of the 1790s had led to large-scale confiscation of land formerly owned by church and king. The restoration of the monarchy led to claims by those dispossessed to have their former lands returned.         Section VIII,  |Primitive_Accumulation|Primitive_Accumulation_Of_Capital|  of Capital involves a critique of Liberal Theories of property rights. Marx notes that under Feudal Law, peasants were legally as entitled to their land as the aristocracy was to its manors. Marx cites several historical events in which large numbers of the peasantry were removed from their lands, which were then seized by the aristocracy. This seized land was then used for commercial ventures . Marx sees this Primitive Accumulation as integral to the creation of English Capitalism. This event created a large un-landed class which had to work for wages in order to survive. Marx asserts that Liberal theories of property are idyllic fairy tales that hide a violent historical process.          |Charles_Comte|Charles_Comte| , in Traité de la propriété , attempted to justify the legitimacy of private property in response to the  |Bourbon_Restoration|Bourbon_Dynasty,_Restored| . According to David Hart, Comte had three main points: firstly, that interference by the state over the centuries in property ownership has had dire consequences for justice as well as for economic productivity; secondly, that property is legitimate when it emerges in such a way as not to harm anyone; and thirdly, that historically some, but by no means all, property which has evolved has done so legitimately, with the implication that the present distribution of property is a complex mixture of legitimately and illegitimately held titles.       Comte, as Proudhon later did, rejected  |Roman_legal_tradition|Roman_Law|  with its toleration of slavery. He posited a communal national property consisting of non-scarce goods, such as land in ancient hunter-gatherer societies. Since agriculture was so much more efficient than hunting and gathering, private property appropriated by someone for farming left remaining hunter-gatherers with more land per person, and hence did not harm them. Thus this type of land appropriation did not violate the  |Lockean_proviso|Lockean_Proviso|  – there was still enough, and as good left. Comtes analysis would be used by later theorists in response to the socialist critique on property.            In his 1840 treatise  What is Property? ,  |Pierre_Proudhon|Pierre_Proudhon|  answers with  |Property_is_theft!|Property_Is_Theft!|  In natural resources, he sees two types of property, de jure property and de facto property , and argues that the former is illegitimate. Proudhons conclusion is that property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition.     His analysis of the product of labor upon natural resources as property is more nuanced. He asserts that land itself cannot be property, yet it should be held by individual possessors as stewards of mankind with the product of labor being the property of the producer. Proudhon reasoned that any wealth gained without labor was stolen from those who labored to create that wealth. Even a voluntary contract to surrender the product of labor to an employer was theft, according to Proudhon, since the controller of natural resources had no moral right to charge others for the use of that which he did not labor to create and therefore did not own.     Proudhons theory of property greatly influenced the budding socialist movement, inspiring anarchist theorists such as  |Mikhail_Bakunin|Mikhail_Bakunin|  who modified Proudhons ideas, as well as antagonizing theorists like  |Karl_Marx|Karl_Marx| .          |Frédéric_Bastiats|Frédéric_Bastiat|  main treatise on property can be found in chapter 8 of his book Economic Harmonies .  In a radical departure from traditional property theory, he defines property not as a physical object, but rather as a relationship between people with respect to an object. Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for I may justly gift or trade this water to another person. In essence, what one owns is not the object but the value of the object. By value, Bastiat apparently means market value; he emphasizes that this is quite different from utility.  In our relations with one another, we are not owners of the utility of things, but of their value, and value is the appraisal made of reciprocal services.      Bastiat theorized that, as a result of technological progress and the division of labor, the stock of communal wealth increases over time; that the hours of work an unskilled laborer expends to buy e.g. 100 liters of wheat decreases over time, thus amounting to gratis satisfaction.  Thus, private property continually destroys itself, becoming transformed into communal wealth. The increasing proportion of communal wealth to private property results in a tendency toward equality of mankind.  Since the human race started from the point of greatest poverty, that is, from the point where there were the most obstacles to be overcome, it is clear that all that has been gained from one era to the next has been due to the spirit of property.      This transformation of private property into the communal domain, Bastiat points out, does not imply that private property will ever totally disappear. This is because man, as he progresses, continually invents new and more sophisticated needs and desires.          |Andrew_J._Galambos|Andrew_Joseph_Galambos|  was an astrophysicist and philosopher who innovated a social structure that seeks to maximize human peace and freedom. Galambos’ concept of property was basic to his philosophy. He defined property as a mans life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life.     Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: “Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full control over his own property.” Galambos, Andrew . Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. pp. 868–869. . Galambos defines property as having the following elements:   Primordial property, which is an individuals life   Primary property, which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions   Secondary property, which includes all tangible and intangible possessions which are derivatives of the individuals primary property.     Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individuals life; this means children are not the property of their parents. Galambos, Andrew . Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. p. 23. . and primary property . Galambos, Andrew . Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. pp. 39, 52, 84, 92–93, 153, 201, 326. .     Galambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property.   For example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individuals money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a persons primordial property.         Contemporary political thinkers who believe that natural persons enjoy rights to own property and to enter into contracts espouse two views about John Locke. On the one hand, some admire Locke, such as  |William_H._Hutt|William_Harold_Hutt|  , who praised Locke for laying down the quintessence of individualism . On the other hand, those such as  |Richard_Pipes|Richard_Pipes|  regard Lockes arguments as weak, and think that undue reliance thereon has weakened the cause of individualism in recent times. Pipes has written that Lockes work marked a regression because it rested on the concept of  |Natural_Law|Natural_Law|  rather than upon Harringtons sociological framework.      |Hernando_de_Soto|Hernando_De_Soto_Polar|  has argued that an important characteristic of capitalist market economy is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal  |property_system|Property_System|  which clearly records ownership and transactions. These property rights and the whole formal system of property make possible:   Greater independence for individuals from local community arrangements to protect their assets   Clear, provable, and protectable ownership   The standardization and integration of property rules and property information in a country as a whole   Increased trust arising from a greater certainty of punishment for cheating in economic transactions   More formal and complex written statements of ownership that permit the easier assumption of shared risk and ownership in companies, and insurance against risk   Greater availability of loans for new projects, since more things can serve as collateral for the loans   Easier access to and more reliable information regarding such things as credit history and the worth of assets   Increased  |fungibility|Fungibility| , standardization and transferability of statements documenting the ownership of property, which paves the way for structures such as national markets for companies and the easy transportation of property through complex networks of individuals and other entities   Greater protection of biodiversity due to minimizing of  |shifting_agriculture|Shifting_Agriculture|  practices     All of the above, according to de Soto, enhance  |economic_growth|Economic_Growth| .
