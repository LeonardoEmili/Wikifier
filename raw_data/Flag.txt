            A flag is a piece of fabric  with a distinctive design and colours. It is used as a  |symbol|Symbol| , a signalling device, or for decoration. The term flag is also used to refer to the  |graphic_design|Graphic_Design|  employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging . The study of flags is known as  |vexillology|Vexillology|  from the  |Latin|Latin|  vexillum, meaning flag or  |banner|Banner|  .      |National_flags|National_Flag|  are  |patriotic|Patriotic|  symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong  |military|Military|  associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose. Flags are also used in  |messaging|Messaging| ,  |advertising|Advertising| , or for  |decorative|Decorative|  purposes.     Some military units are called flags after their use of flags. A flag is equivalent to a  |brigade|Brigade|  in Arab countries. In Spain, a flag  is a  |battalion|Battalion| -equivalent in the  |Spanish_Legion|Spanish_Legion| .             The origin of the flag is unknown. Inglefield, p. 39. In antiquity,  |field_signs|Field_Sign|  or standards were used in warfare that can be categorised as  |vexilloid|Vexilloid|  or flag-like. This originated in  |ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt|  or  |Assyria|Assyria| . . Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved February 15, 2019. Examples include the  |Sassanid|Sassanid|  battle standard  |Derafsh_Kaviani|Derafsh_Kaviani| , and the standards of the  |Roman_legions|Roman_Legion|  such as the  |eagle|Aquila|  of  |Augustus_Caesars|Augustus_Caesar| |Xth_legion|Legio_X_Fretensis| , or the  |dragon_standard|Draconarius|  of the  |Sarmatians|Sarmatians| ; the latter was let fly freely in the wind, carried by a horseman, but judging from depictions it was more similar to an elongated  |dragon_kite|Dragon_Kite|  than to a simple flag.     Flags as recognized today, made of a piece of cloth representing a particular entity, were invented in the  |Indian_subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent|  or  |Chinese|Ancient_China| |Zhou_dynasty|Zhou_Dynasty|  . Chinese flags depicted colorful animals and royal flags were to be treated with a similar level of respect attributed to the ruler. Indian flags were often triangular and decorated with attachments such as  |yaks|Yak|  tail and the state umbrella. These usages spread to  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia|  as well, and were transmitted to Europe through the  |Muslim_world|Muslim_World|  where plainly colored flags were being used due to  |Islamic_prescriptions|Aniconism_In_Islam| .     In  |Europe|Europe| , during the  |High_Middle_Ages|High_Middle_Ages| , flags came to be used primarily as a  |heraldic_device|Heraldic_Flag|  in battle, allowing more easily to identify a knight than only from the heraldic device painted on the shield. Already during the high medieval period, and increasingly during the  |Late_Middle_Ages|Late_Middle_Ages| ,  |city_states|City_State|  and  |communes|Medieval_Commune|  such as those of the  |Old_Swiss_Confederacy|Old_Swiss_Confederacy|  also began to use flags as field signs. Regimental flags for individual units became commonplace during the  |Early_Modern_period|Early_Modern_Period| .          During the peak of the  |age_of_sail|Age_Of_Sail| , beginning in the early 17th century, it was customary for ships to carry flags designating their nationality; Articles 90–94 of the  |UN_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea|Un_Convention_On_The_Law_Of_The_Sea|  these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and  |maritime_flags|Maritime_Flags|  of today. Flags also became the preferred means of  |communications|Communication|  at sea, resulting in various systems of flag signals; see, International maritime signal flags .     Use of flags outside of military or naval context begins only with the rise of  |nationalist|Nationalism|  sentiment by the end of the 18th century, although some flags date back earlier. The flags of countries such as Austria, Denmark or Turkey emerged from the midst of legend while many others, including those of Poland and Switzerland, grew out of the heraldic emblems of the Middle Ages. The 17th century saw the birth of several  |national_flags|National_Flag|  through revolutionary struggle. One of these was the flag of the Netherlands, which appeared during the 80-year Dutch rebellion which began in 1568 against Spanish domination. Inglefield, p. 48.     Political change and social reform, allied to a growing sense of nationhood among ordinary people, led to the birth of new nations and flags all over the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. Inglefield, p. 50.                     One of the most popular uses of a flag is to symbolise a  |nation|Nation|  or  |country|Country| . Some  |national_flags|National_Flag|  have been particularly inspirational to other nations, countries, or subnational entities in the design of their own flags. Some prominent examples include:     |flag_of_Denmark|Flag_Of_Denmark| , the Dannebrog, is attested in 1478, and is the oldest national flag still in use. It inspired the  |cross_design|Nordic_Cross_Flag|  of the other  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries| |Norway|Flag_Of_Norway| ,  |Sweden|Flag_Of_Sweden| ,  |Finland|Flag_Of_Finland| ,  |Iceland|Flag_Of_Iceland| , and regional Scandinavian flags for the  |Faroe_Islands|Flag_Of_The_Faroe_Islands| ,  |Åland|Flag_Of_Åland| ,  |Scania|Flag_Of_Skåneland|  and  |Bornholm|Flag_Of_Bornholm| , as well as flags for the non-Scandinavian  |Shetland|Flag_Of_Shetland|  and  |Orkney|Flag_Of_Orkney| . . An earlier use of the white cross on red is attested by an armorial of 1370-1386. In later monastic tradition, the Danneborg made its first, miraculous appearance at the Battle of Lindanise on 15 June 1219.   The  |flag_of_the_Netherlands|Flag_Of_The_Netherlands|  is the oldest  |tricolour|Tricolour| . Its three colours of red, white and blue go back to  |Charlemagnes|Charlemagne|  time, the 9th century. The coastal region of what today is the Netherlands was then known for its cloth in these colours. Maps from the early 16th century already put flags in these colours next to this region, like Texeiras map of 1520. A century before that, during the 15th century, the three colours were mentioned as the coastal signals for this area, with the three bands straight or diagonal, single or doubled. As  |state_flag|State_Flag|  it first appeared around 1572 as the  |Princes_Flag|Princes_Flag|  in orange–white–blue. Soon the more famous red–white–blue began appearing, becoming the prevalent version from around 1630. Orange made a comeback during the civil war of the late 18th century, signifying the orangist or pro- |stadtholder|Stadtholder|  party. During World War II the pro-Nazi  |NSB|National_Socialist_Movement_In_The_Netherlands|  used it. Any symbolism has been added later to the three colours, although the orange comes from the  |House_of_Orange-Nassau|House_Of_Orange-Nassau| . This use of orange comes from Nassau, which today uses orange-blue, not from Orange, which today uses red-blue. However, the usual way to show the link with the House of Orange-Nassau is the orange pennant above the red-white-blue. It is said that the Dutch Tricolour has inspired   many flags but most notably those of  |Russia|Russia| ,  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , and  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  . As the probable inspiration for the Russian flag, it is the source too for the  |Pan-Slavic_colours|Pan-Slavic_Colours|  red, white and blue, adopted by many  |Slavic|Slavic_Peoples|  states and peoples as their symbols; examples are  |Slovakia|Flag_Of_Slovakia| ,  |Serbia|Flag_Of_Serbia| , and  |Slovenia|Flag_Of_Slovenia| .   The national  |flag_of_France|Flag_Of_France|  was designed in 1794. As a forerunner of revolution, Frances tricolour flag style has been adopted by other nations. Examples:  |Italy|Flag_Of_Italy| ,  |Costa_Rica|Flag_Of_Costa_Rica| ,  |Dominican_Republic|Flag_Of_Dominican_Republic| ,  |Ireland|Flag_Of_Ireland| ,  |Haiti|Flag_Of_Haiti| ,  |Romania|Flag_Of_Romania|  and  |Mexico|Flag_Of_Mexico| .  |Union_Flag|Union_Flag|  of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  is the most commonly used. British colonies typically flew a flag based on one of the ensigns based on this flag, and many former colonies have retained the design to acknowledge their cultural history. Examples:  |Australia|Flag_Of_Australia| ,  |Fiji|Flag_Of_Fiji| ,  |New_Zealand|Flag_Of_New_Zealand| ,  |Tuvalu|Flag_Of_Tuvalu| , and also the Canadian provinces of  |Manitoba|Flag_Of_Manitoba| ,  |Ontario|Flag_Of_Ontario|  and  |British_Columbia|Flag_Of_British_Columbia| , and the American state of  |Hawaii|Flag_Of_Hawaii| ; see commons:Flags based on British ensigns .   The  |flag_of_the_United_States|Flag_Of_The_United_States|  is nicknamed The Stars and Stripes or Old Glory.  Some nations imitated this flag so as to symbolise their similarity to the United States and/or the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| . Examples:  |Liberia|Flag_Of_Liberia| ,   |Chile|Flag_Of_Chile| ,  |Uruguay|Flag_Of_Uruguay| ,  |Taiwan|Flag_Of_The_Republic_Of_China| , and the  |French|France|  region of  |Brittany|Flag_Of_Brittany| .     |Ethiopia|Ethiopia|  was seen as a model by emerging  |Africa|Africa| n states of the 1950s and 1960s, as it was one of the oldest independent states in Africa. Accordingly, its  |flag|Flag_Of_Ethiopia|  became the source of the  |Pan-African_colours|Pan-African_Colours| , or Rasta colours. Examples:  |Benin|Flag_Of_Benin| ,  |Togo|Flag_Of_Togo| ,  |Senegal|Flag_Of_Senegal| ,  |Ghana|Flag_Of_Ghana| ,  |Mali|Flag_Of_Mali| ,  |Guinea|Flag_Of_Guinea| .   The  |flag_of_Turkey|Flag_Of_Turkey| , which is very similar to the last flag of the old  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , has been an inspiration for the flag designs of many other Muslim nations. During the time of the Ottomans the  |crescent|Crescent|  began to be associated with  |Islam|Islam|  and this is reflected on the flags of  |Algeria|Flag_Of_Algeria| ,  |Azerbaijan|Flag_Of_Azerbaijan| ,  |Comoros|Flag_Of_Comoros| ,  |Libya|Flag_Of_Libya| ,  |Mauritania|Flag_Of_Mauritania| ,  |Pakistan|Flag_Of_Pakistan| ,  |Tunisia|Flag_Of_Tunisia|  and  |Maldives|Flag_Of_Maldives| |Pan-Arab_colours|Pan-Arab_Colours| , green, white, red and black, are derived from the flag of the  |Great_Arab_Revolt|Arab_Revolt|  as seen on the flags of  |Jordan|Flag_Of_Jordan| ,  |Libya|Flag_Of_Libya| ,  |Kuwait|Flag_Of_Kuwait| ,  |Sudan|Flag_Of_Sudan| ,  |Syria|Flag_Of_Syria| , the  |United_Arab_Emirates|Flag_Of_United_Arab_Emirates| ,  |Western_Sahara|Flag_Of_The_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic| ,  |Egypt|Flag_Of_Egypt| ,  |Iraq|Flag_Of_Iraq| ,  |Yemen|Flag_Of_Yemen|  and  |Palestine|Palestinian_Flag| .   The  |Soviet_flag|Flag_Of_The_Soviet_Union| , with its golden symbols of the  |hammer_and_sickle|Hammer_And_Sickle|  on a red field, was an inspiration to flags of other  |communist|Communism|  states, such as  |East_Germany|Flag_Of_East_Germany| ,  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Flag_Of_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China| ,  |Vietnam|Flag_Of_Vietnam| ,  |Angola|Flag_Of_Angola| ,  |Afghanistan|Flag_Of_Afghanistan|  and  |Mozambique|Flag_Of_Mozambique| .   The  |flag_of_Venezuela|Flag_Of_Venezuela| , created by  |Francisco_de_Miranda|Francisco_De_Miranda|  to represent the independence movement in Venezuela that later gave birth to the  |Gran_Colombia|Republic_Of_Gran_Colombia| , inspired the flags of  |Colombia|Flag_Of_Colombia| ,  |Ecuador|Flag_Of_Ecuador| , and  |the_Federal_Territories_in_Malaysia|Flag_Of_The_Federal_Territory| , all sharing three bands of yellow, blue and red with the flag of Venezuela.   The  |flag_of_Argentina|Flag_Of_Argentina| , created by  |Manuel_Belgrano|Manuel_Belgrano|  during the war of independence, was the inspiration for the  |United_Provinces_of_Central_Americas|United_Provinces_Of_Central_America|  flag, which in turn was the origin for the flags of  |Guatemala|Flag_Of_Guatemala| ,  |Honduras|Flag_Of_Honduras| ,  |El_Salvador|Flag_Of_El_Salvador| , and  |Nicaragua|Flag_Of_Nicaragua| .     National flag designs are often used to signify nationality in other forms, such as  |flag_patch|Flag_Patch| es.          A civil flag is a version of the national flag that is flown by civilians on non-government installations or craft. The use of civil flags was more common in the past, in order to denote buildings or ships that were not manned by the military. In some countries the civil flag is the same as the  |war_flag|War_Flag|  or  |state_flag|State_Flag| , but without the coat of arms, such as in the case of  |Spain|Flag_Of_Spain| , and in others its an alteration of the war flag.               Several countries, including the  |British_Army|British_Army|  and the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy|   of the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|   and the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  have had  |unique_flags|Union_Jack|  flown by their  |armed_forces|Armed_Forces|  separately, rather than the  |national_flag|National_Flag| .     Other countries armed forces  use their standard  |national_flag|Flag_Of_The_United_States| , in addition, the U.S. has alongside flags and seals designed from long tradition for each of its six uniformed military services/military sub-departments in the  |U.S._Department_of_Defense|United_States_Department_Of_Defense|  and the  |U.S._Department_of_Homeland_Security|United_States_Department_Of_Homeland_Security| . The  |Philippines|Philippines|  armed forces may use their  |standard_national_flag|Flag_Of_The_Philippines| , but during times of war the flag is turned upside down.  |Bulgarias|Flag_Of_Bulgaria|  flag is also turned upside down during times of war. These are also considered war flags, though the terminology only applies to the flags military usage.     Large versions of the war flag flown on the  |warships|Warship|  of countries  |navies|Navy|  are known as  |battle_ensigns|Battle_Ensign| . In addition besides flying the national standard or a military services emblem flag at a military fort, base, station or post and at sea at the stern or main top mast of a warship, a  |Naval_Jack_flag|Jack|  and other  |Maritime_flags|Maritime_Flag| ,  |pennants|Pennant|  and emblems are flown at the bow . In times of war waving a white flag is a banner of truce, talks/negotiations or surrender.     Four distinctive  |Africa|Africa| n flags currently in the collection of the  |National_Maritime_Museum|National_Maritime_Museum|  in  |Britain|United_Kingdom|  were flown in action by  |Itsekiri|Itsekiri|  ships under the control of  |Nana_Olomu|Nana_Olomu|  during conflict in the late  |19th_century|19Th_Century| . One is the flag generally known as the  |Benin_Empire_flag|Flag_Of_The_Benin_Empire|  and one is referred to as Nana Olomus flag.           Among international flags are the  |Flag_of_the_United_Nations|Flag_Of_The_United_Nations| , the  |Olympic_flag|Olympic_Symbolsflag| , and the  |Paralympic_flag|Paralympic_Symbolsflag| .             Flags are particularly important at sea, where they can mean the difference between life and death, and consequently where the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an  |ensign|Ensign| . A courteous, peaceable  |merchant_ship|Merchant_Navy|  or  |yacht|Yacht|  customarily flies its ensign , together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast . To fly ones ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with  |cannon|Cannon| , for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties. In some countries  |yacht_ensigns|Yacht_Ensign|  are different from merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying  |cargo|Cargo|  that requires a  |customs|Customs|  declaration. Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be  |smuggling|Smuggling|  in many jurisdictions. Traditionally, a vessel flying under the courtesy flag of a specific nation, regardless of the vessels country of registry, is considered to be operating under the law of her host nation.        There is a system of  |international_maritime_signal_flags|International_Maritime_Signal_Flags|  for numerals and letters of the alphabet. Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually. As well,  |semaphore_flags|Flag_Semaphore|  can be used to communicate on an ad hoc basis from ship to ship over short distances.     Another category of maritime flag flown by some  |United_States_Government|United_States_Government|  ships is the  |distinguishing_mark|Distinguishing_Mark| . Although the  |United_States_Coast_Guard|United_States_Coast_Guard|  has its own service ensign, all other U.S. Government ships fly the national ensign their service ensign, following  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy|  practice. To distinguish themselves from ships of the Navy, such ships historically have flown their parent organisations flag from a forward mast as a distinguishing mark. Today, for example, commissioned ships of the  |National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration|National_Oceanic_And_Atmospheric_Administration|  fly the  |NOAA_flag|National_Oceanic_And_Atmospheric_Administrationflag|  as a distinguishing mark.                Flags are usually rectangular in shape , but may be of any shape or size that is practical for flying, including square, triangular, or swallow tailed. A more unusual flag shape is that of the  |flag_of_Nepal|Flag_Of_Nepal| , which is in the shape of two stacked triangles. Other unusually shaped flags include the civil flags of  |Ohio|Flag_Of_Ohio|  ;  |Tampa,_Florida|Flag_Of_Tampa,_Florida| ; and  |Pike_County,_Ohio|Pike_County,_Ohio| .      Many flags are dyed  |through_and_through|Through_And_Through|  to be inexpensive to manufacture, such that the reverse side is the  |mirror_image|Mirror_Image|  of the  |obverse|Obverse|  side, generally the side displayed when, from the observers point of view, the flag flies from pole-side left to right. This presents two possibilities:     If the design is  |symmetric|Symmetric| al in an axis parallel to the flag pole, obverse and reverse will be identical despite the mirror-reversal, such as the  |Indian_Flag|Flag_Of_India|  or  |Canadian_Flag|Flag_Of_Canada|    If not, the obverse and reverse will present two variants of the same design, one with the  |hoist|Flag_Terminologydescription_Of_Standard_Flag_Parts_And_Terms|  on the left , the other with the hoist on the right . This is very common and usually not disturbing if there is no text in the design.     Some complex flag designs are not intended to be shown on both sides, requiring separate obverse and reverse sides if made correctly. In these cases there is a design element which is not symmetric and should be read in the same direction, regardless of whether the hoist is to the viewers left or right. These cases can be divided into two types:     The same design may be duplicated on both sides. Such flags can be manufactured by creating two identical through and through flags and then sewing them back to back, though this can affect the resulting combinations responsiveness to the wind. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol , indicating the reverse is congruent to the obverse.   Rarely, the reverse design may differ, in whole or in part, from that of the obverse. Examples of  |flags_whose_reverse_differs_from_the_obverse|Flags_Whose_Reverse_Differs_From_The_Obverse|  include the  |flag_of_Paraguay|Flag_Of_Paraguay| , the  |flag_of_Oregon|Flag_Of_Oregon| , and the historical  |flag_of_the_Soviet_Union|Flag_Of_The_Soviet_Union| . Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol .        Common designs on flags include crosses, stripes, and divisions of the surface, or field, into bands or quarters—patterns and principles mainly derived from  |heraldry|Heraldry| . A heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a  |banner_of_arms|Bannerheraldic_Banners| , as is done on both the state  |flag_of_Maryland|Flag_Of_Maryland|  and the  |flag_of_Kiribati|Flag_Of_Kiribati| .     The de jure  |flag_of_Libya|Flag_Of_Libya|  under  |Muammar_Gaddafi|Muammar_Gaddafi| , which consisted of a rectangular field of green, was for a long period the only national flag using a single colour and no design or insignia. However, other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia, such as the short-lived  |Soviet_Republic_of_Hungary|Hungarian_Soviet_Republic|  and the more recent  |Sultanate_of_Muscat_and_Oman|Muscat_And_Oman| , whose flags were both a plain field of red.     Colours are normally described with common names, such as red , but may be further specified using  |colourimetry|Colorimetry| .     The largest flag flown from a flagpole worldwide, according to Guinness World Records, is the  |flag_of_Mexico|Flag_Of_Mexico|  flown in  |Piedras_Negras|Piedras_Negras,_Coahuila| ,  |Mexico|Mexico| . This flag was about .  The largest flag ever made was the  |flag_of_Qatar|Flag_Of_Qatar| ; the flag, which measures at , was completed in December 2013 in  |Doha|Doha| .           The general parts of a flag are: canton , field or ground , the hoist , and the fly .        Vertical flags are sometimes used in lieu of the standard horizontal flag in central and eastern Europe, particularly in the German-speaking countries. This practice came about because the relatively brisk wind needed to display horizontal flags is not common in these countries.           The standard horizontal flag is nonetheless the form most often used even in these countries.  |German_Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior|Federal_Ministry_Of_The_Interior| http://www.protokoll-inland.de/PI/DE/Beflaggung/Allgemeines/Hissflagge/hissflaggenode.html Hissflagge, accessed 20 February 2012     The vertical flag  is a vertical form of the standard flag. The flags design may remain unchanged or it may change, e.g. by changing horizontal stripes to vertical ones . If the flag carries an emblem, it may remain centred or may be shifted slightly upwards.  |German_Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior|Federal_Ministry_Of_The_Interior| http://www.protokoll-inland.de/PI/DE/Beflaggung/Allgemeines/Hochformatflagge/hochformatflaggenode.html Hochformatflagge, accessed 20 February 2012     The vertical flag for hoisting from a beam  is additionally attached to a horizontal beam, ensuring that it is fully displayed even if there is no wind.  |German_Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior|Federal_Ministry_Of_The_Interior| http://www.protokoll-inland.de/PI/DE/Beflaggung/Allgemeines/Auslegerflagge/auslegerflaggenode.html Auslegerflagge, accessed 20 February 2012     The vertical flag for hoisting from a horizontal pole  is hoisted from a horizontal pole, normally attached to a building. The topmost stripe on the horizontal version of the flag faces away from the building.  |German_Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior|Federal_Ministry_Of_The_Interior| http://www.protokoll-inland.de/PI/DE/Beflaggung/Allgemeines/Haengeflagge/haengeflaggenode.html Hängeflagge, accessed 20 February 2012     The vertical flag for hoisting from a crossbar or  |banner|Banner|   is firmly attached to a horizontal crossbar from which it is hoisted, either by a vertical pole or a horizontal one . The topmost stripe on the horizontal version of the flag normally faces to the left.  |German_Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior|Federal_Ministry_Of_The_Interior| http://www.protokoll-inland.de/PI/DE/Beflaggung/Allgemeines/Haengeflagge/haengeflaggenode.html Hängeflagge, accessed 20 February 2012            Flags can play many different roles in religion. In  |Buddhism|Buddhism| ,  |prayer_flags|Prayer_Flags|  are used, usually in sets of five differently coloured flags. Several flags and banners including the  |Black_Standard|Black_Standard|  are  |associated_with_Islam|Islamic_Flags| . Many  |national_flags|Religion_In_National_Flags|  and other flags include religious symbols such as the cross, the crescent, or a reference to a patron saint. Flags are also adopted by religious groups and flags such as the  |Jain_flag|Jain_Flag| ,  |Nishan_Sahib|Nishan_Sahib|  , the  |Saffron_Flag|Saffron_Flag|  and the  |Christian_flag|Christian_Flag| |Jain_–_Five-Coloured_Flag|Jain_Flag|          As languages rarely have a flag designed to represent them,  it is a common but unofficial practice to use national flags to identify them. The practice is discouraged    when this is not the samee.g. Portuguese Language: Flag of Portugal in Europe and Flag of Brazil in South AmericaWashington D.C.: Middle East Institute, 1966between 1865 and 1912for the first few days of the Republic |sociation_footba|Sociation_Footba| |otba|Otba| |sociation_footba|Sociation_Footba| |stralian_rules_footba|Stralian_Rules_Footba| worth six pointsworth one pointA rare example of a golf course that does not use flags to mark the hole is the East Course of  |Merion_Golf_Club|Merion_Golf_Club| , which instead uses flagpoles topped by  |wicker_baskets|Merion_Golf_Clubwicker_Baskets| .see  |Image_of_the_Embassy_flag|:File:British_Ambassador_Ensign.Svg| see  |Image_of_the_Embassy_flag|:File:Embassador_Flag_Of_Thailand.Svg| |liti|Liti| |y_moveme|Y_Moveme| in the UK also other dangers  a black circle on a yellow squareexact meanings are set by the individual railroad companyor on the train attached to itexact meanings are set by the individual railroad companynot on the timetable |ggi|Ggi| originally meant to keep a wooden pole from splitting1991height: height: height: and the tallest flying the tricolourand the tallest flying an American flagtypically a steel taper or a  |Greek_entasis|Entasis|  taper |ggi|Ggi| |ggi|Ggi| |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| flagpoleor lighted wands .
