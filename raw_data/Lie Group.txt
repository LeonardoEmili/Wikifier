         In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a Lie group  is a  |group|Group|  that is also a  |differentiable_manifold|Differentiable_Manifold| , with the property that the group operations are smooth. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician  |Sophus_Lie|Sophus_Lie| , who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous  |transformation_groups|Transformation_Group| .     In rough terms, a Lie group is a continuous group, that is, one whose elements are described by several real parameters. As such, Lie groups provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry, such as rotational symmetry in three dimensions. Lie groups are widely used in many parts of modern mathematics and physics. Lies original motivation for introducing Lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of  |differential_equations|Differential_Equations| , in much the same way that finite groups are used in  |Galois_theory|Galois_Theory|  to model the discrete symmetries of  |algebraic_equations|Algebraic_Equation| .          Lie groups are  |smooth|Smoothness| |differentiable_manifolds|Differentiable_Manifold|  and as such can be studied using  |differential_calculus|Differential_Calculus| , in contrast with the case of more general  |topological_groups|Topological_Group| . One of the key ideas in the theory of Lie groups is to replace the global object, the group, with its local or linearized version, which Lie himself called its infinitesimal group and which has since become known as its  |Lie_algebra|Lie_Algebra| .     Lie groups play an enormous role in modern  |geometry|Geometry| , on several different levels.  |Felix_Klein|Felix_Klein|  argued in his  |Erlangen_program|Erlangen_Program|  that one can consider various geometries by specifying an appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties  |invariant|Invariant| . Thus  |Euclidean_geometry|Euclidean_Geometry|  corresponds to the choice of the group  |E|Euclidean_Group|  of distance-preserving transformations of the Euclidean space R 3 ,  |conformal_geometry|Conformal_Geometry|  corresponds to enlarging the group to the  |conformal_group|Conformal_Group| , whereas in  |projective_geometry|Projective_Geometry|  one is interested in the properties invariant under the  |projective_group|Projective_Group| . This idea later led to the notion of a  |G_structure|G_Structure| , where G is a Lie group of local symmetries of a manifold.     Lie groups play a major role in modern physics, with the Lie group typically playing the role of a symmetry of a physical system. Here, the  |representations|Representation_Of_A_Lie_Group|  of the Lie group  are especially important. Representation theory  |is_used_extensively_in_particle_physics|Particle_Physics_And_Representation_Theory| . Groups whose representations are of particular importance include  |the_rotation_group_SO|3Drotationgroup|  ,  |the_special_unitary_group_SU|Clebsch–Gordan_Coefficients_For_Surepresentations_Of_The_Su_283_29_Group|  and the  |Poincaré_group|Representation_Theory_Of_The_Poincaré_Group| .     On a global level, whenever a Lie group  |acts|Group_Action|  on a geometric object, such as a  |Riemannian|Riemannian_Manifold|  or a  |symplectic_manifold|Symplectic_Manifold| , this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure. The presence of continuous symmetries expressed via a  |Lie_group_action|Lie_Group_Action|  on a manifold places strong constraints on its geometry and facilitates  |analysis|Global_Analysis|  on the manifold. Linear actions of Lie groups are especially important, and are studied in  |representation_theory|Representation_Theory| .     In the 1940s  1950s,  |Ellis_Kolchin|Ellis_Kolchin| ,  |Armand_Borel|Armand_Borel| , and  |Claude_Chevalley|Claude_Chevalley|  realised that many foundational results concerning Lie groups can be developed completely algebraically, giving rise to the theory of  |algebraic_groups|Algebraic_Group|  defined over an arbitrary  |field|Field| . This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most  |finite_simple_groups|Finite_Simple_Group| , as well as in  |algebraic_geometry|Algebraic_Geometry| . The theory of  |automorphic_forms|Automorphic_Form| , an important branch of modern  |number_theory|Number_Theory| , deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over  |adele_rings|Adele_Ring| ;  |p_adic|P_Adic_Number|  Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.       A real Lie group is a  |group|Group|  that is also a finite-dimensional real  |smooth_manifold|Differentiable_Manifolddefinition| , in which the group operations of  |multiplication|Multiplication|  and inversion are  |smooth_maps|Smooth_Map| . Smoothness of the group multiplication     :   G  G        means that μ is a smooth mapping of the  |product_manifold|Manifoldcartesian_Products|   into G. These two requirements can be combined to the single requirement that the mapping   :   xy   be a smooth mapping of the product manifold into G.       The 2×2  |real|Real_Number| |_invertible_matrices|Invertible_Matrix|  form a group under multiplication, denoted by  or by GL 2  |noncompact|Compact_Space|  real Lie group; it is an open subset of   R4 . This group is  |disconnected|Connected_Space| ; it has two connected components corresponding to the positive and negative values of the  |determinant|Determinant| .     The  |rotation|Rotation|  matrices form a  |subgroup|Subgroup|  of , denoted by . It is a Lie group in its own right: specifically, a one-dimensional compact connected Lie group which is  |diffeomorphic|Diffeomorphic|  to the  |circle|Circle| . Using the rotation angle   as a parameter, this group can be  |parametrized|Parametric_Equations|  as follows:   ::         :Addition of the angles corresponds to multiplication of the elements of , and taking the opposite angle corresponds to inversion. Thus both multiplication and inversion are differentiable maps.     The  |affine_group_of_one_dimension|Affine_Groupmatrix_Representation|  is a two-dimensional matrix Lie group, consisting of 2  2 real, upper-triangular matrices, with the first diagonal entry being positive and the second diagonal entry being 1. Thus, the group consists of matrices of the form   :: A   a /math math /math math /math  math /math  ref  /ref math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math  |ath_math_math_math_math_math_math_mat|Ath_Math_Math_Math_Math_Math_Math_Mat|  math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  ref  /ref  ref name Hall  /ref ref  /ref   math /math  math /math  ref  /ref  math /math  math /math  math /math  math /math math /math  math /math  math /math  ref  /ref  math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math math /math  |ub_su|Ub_Su| |ub_su|Ub_Su| |ub_su|Ub_Su| |ub_su|Ub_Su| |ub_su|Ub_Su|  sup  /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup  /sup  sup  /sup  sup  /sup br /  br /  br /  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup  sup /sup sup /sup  math /math ref  /ref ref name Hall/  math /math ref  /ref ref  /ref  sub /sub  sub  /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  math /math math /math  sub  /sub math /math  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sup /sup  sup /sup  sub /sub  ref  /ref  math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math  ref  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  math /math  math /math math /math  ref  /ref math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math  ref  /ref  math /math  math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math ref  /ref math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math  math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math  math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math  math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math math /math  ref groupNote  /ref  |up_su|Up_Su|  math /math math /math  math /math  math /math math /math  math /math  math /math math /math math /math  math /math math /math  math /math math /math  math /math math /math ref  /ref math /math  math /math  math /math math /math  math /math  math /math  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  !--   Need specific reference from Borels book to Weyls work, in particular, distinction mentioned in the text   --  sub  /sub sub  /sub sub  /sub sub  /sub sub /sub  sup /sup  ref  /ref  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub  sup /sup  sub /sub  ref  /ref  .
