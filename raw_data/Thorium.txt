            Thorium is a weakly  |radioactive|Radioactive_Decay|  metallic  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Th and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  90. Thorium is silvery and  |tarnish|Tarnish| es black when it is exposed to air, forming  |thorium_dioxide|Thorium_Dioxide| ; it is moderately hard,  |malleable|Malleable| , and has a high  |melting_point|Melting_Point| . Thorium is an electropositive  |actinide|Actinide|  whose chemistry is dominated by the +4  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State| ; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.     All known thorium  |isotopes|Isotope|  are unstable. The most stable isotope, 232 Th, has a half-life of 14.05  billion  years, or about the  |age_of_the_universe|Age_Of_The_Universe| ; it decays very slowly via  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay| , starting a  |decay_chain|Decay_Chain|  named the  |thorium_series|Thorium_Series|  that ends at stable 208  |Pb|Lead| . On Earth, thorium,  |bismuth|Bismuth| , and  |uranium|Uranium|  are the only three radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as  |primordial_elements|Primordial_Nuclide| . It is estimated to be over three times as  |abundant|Natural_Abundance|  as uranium in the Earths crust, and is chiefly refined from  |monazite|Monazite|  sands as a by-product of extracting  |rare_earth_metals|Rare_Earth_Metal| .     Thorium was discovered in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist  |Morten_Thrane_Esmark|Morten_Thrane_Esmark|  and identified by the Swedish chemist  |Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius| , who named it after  |Thor|Thor| , the  |Norse_god|List_Of_Germanic_Deities|  of thunder. Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. Thoriums radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century. In the second half of the century, thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about its radioactivity.     Thorium is still being used as an alloying element in  |TIG_welding|Tig_Welding|  electrodes but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions. It was also material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in  |gas_mantles|Gas_Mantle| , but these uses have become marginal. It has been suggested as a replacement for uranium as nuclear fuel in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor| , and several  |thorium_reactors|Thorium_Fuel_Cyclereactors|  have been built.       Thorium is a moderately  |soft|Hardness| ,  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism| , bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , it lies to the right of  |actinium|Actinium| , to the left of  |protactinium|Protactinium| , and below  |cerium|Cerium| . Pure thorium is very  |ductile|Ductility|  and, as normal for metals, can be  |cold_rolled|Cold_Rollingcold_Rolling| ,  |swaged|Swaging| , and  |drawn|Drawing| . At room temperature, thorium metal has a  |face_centred_cubic|Cubic_Crystal_System|  crystal structure; it has two other forms, one at high temperature and one at high pressure .     Thorium metal has a  |bulk_modulus|Bulk_Modulus|  of 54   |GPa|Gigapascal| , about the same as  |tins|Tin|  .  |Aluminiums|Aluminium|  is 75.2  GPa; coppers 137.8  GPa; and mild steels is 160–169  GPa.  Thorium is about as hard as soft  |steel|Steel| , so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and pulled into wire.      Thorium is nearly half as dense as  |uranium|Uranium|  and  |plutonium|Plutonium|  and is harder than either of them. It becomes  |superconductive|Superconductor|  below 1.4   |K|Kelvin| . Thoriums  |melting_point|Melting_Point|  of 1750  °C is above both those of actinium and protactinium . At the start of  |period_7|Period_7_Element| , from  |francium|Francium|  to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase , because the number of delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to  |plutonium|Plutonium| , where the number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6: this trend is due to the increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding.  Among the actinides up to  |californium|Californium| , which can be studied in at least milligram quantities, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; only actinium is lighter. Thoriums boiling point of 4788  °C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points.     The properties of thorium vary widely depending on the degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually  |thorium_dioxide|Thorium_Dioxide|  ; even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5  and  11.66  g/cm 3 : these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7  g/cm 3 calculated from thoriums  |lattice_parameters|Lattice_Parameter| , perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium and protactinium , part of a trend across the early actinides.     Thorium can form  |alloys|Alloy|  with many other metals. Addition of small proportions of thorium improves the mechanical strength of  |magnesium|Magnesium| , and thorium-aluminum alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. Thorium forms  |eutectic_mixtures|Eutectic_Mixture|  with  |chromium|Chromium|  and uranium, and it is completely  |miscible|Miscibility|  in both solid and liquid  |states|State_Of_Matter|  with its lighter  |congener|Congener|  cerium.          All but two elements up to  |bismuth|Bismuth|  have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes , with the exceptions being  |technetium|Technetium|  and  |promethium|Promethium|  . All elements from  |polonium|Polonium|  onward are measurably  |radioactive|Radioactive_Decay| . 232 Th is one of the three nuclides beyond bismuth  that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05  billion  years, about three times the  |age_of_the_earth|Age_Of_The_Earth| , and slightly longer than the  |age_of_the_universe|Age_Of_The_Universe| . Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earths formation has survived to the present.    232 Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature. Its stability is attributed to its closed  |nuclear_shell|Nuclear_Shell|  with 142 neutrons.   Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with  |atomic_weight|Standard_Atomic_Weight|  232.0377. It is one of only four radioactive elements that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for a standard atomic weight to be determined.     Thorium nuclei are susceptible to  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay|  because the strong nuclear force cannot overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons.  The alpha decay of 232 Th initiates the 4n  |decay_chain|Decay_Chain|  which includes isotopes with a  |mass_number|Mass_Number|  divisible by 4 . This chain of consecutive alpha and  |beta_decays|Beta_Decay|  begins with the decay of 232 Th to 228 Ra and terminates at 208 Pb. Any sample of thorium or its compounds contains traces of these daughters, which are isotopes of  |thallium|Thallium| ,  |lead|Lead| , bismuth, polonium,  |radon|Radon| ,  |radium|Radium| , and actinium. Natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract useful daughter nuclides, such as 212 Pb, which is used in  |nuclear_medicine|Nuclear_Medicine|  for  |cancer_therapy|Cancer_Therapy| .   227 Th can also be used in cancer treatments such as  |targeted_alpha_therapies|Targeted_Alpha_Particle_Therapy| .    232 Th also very occasionally undergoes  |spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission|  rather than alpha decay, and has left evidence of doing so in its minerals , but the  |partial_half_life|Partial_Half_Life|  of this process is very large at over 10 21  years and alpha decay predominates.         Thirty  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  have been characterised, which range in mass number from 209  to 238. After 232 Th, the most stable of them are 230 Th , 229 Th , 228 Th , 234 Th , and 227 Th . All of these isotopes occur in nature as  |trace_radioisotopes|Trace_Radioisotope|  due to their presence in the decay chains of 232 Th, 235 U, 238 U, and 237  |Np|Neptunium| |extinct|Extinct_Radionuclide|  in nature due to its short half-life , but is continually produced in minute traces from  |neutron_capture|Neutron_Capture|  in uranium ores. All of the remaining thorium isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes.     In deep  |seawaters|Seawater|  the isotope 230 Th makes up to 0.04% of natural thorium. This is because its parent 238 U is soluble in water, but 230 Th is insoluble and precipitates into the sediment. Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230 Th isotope, since 230 Th is one of the daughters of 238 U. The  |International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry|International_Union_Of_Pure_And_Applied_Chemistry|  reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013; it had formerly been considered a  |mononuclidic_element|Mononuclidic_Element| .     Thorium has three known  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  , 216m1 Th, 216m2 Th, and 229m Th. 229m Th has the lowest known excitation energy of any isomer,  measured to be . This is so low that when it undergoes  |isomeric_transition|Isomeric_Transition| , the emitted gamma radiation is in the  |ultraviolet|Ultraviolet|  range.        Different isotopes of thorium are chemically identical, but have slightly differing physical properties: for example, the densities of pure 228 Th, 229 Th, 230 Th, and 232 Th are respectively expected to be 11.5, 11.6, 11.6, and 11.7  g/cm 3 .  The isotope 229 Th is expected to be  |fissionable|Fissionable|  with a bare  |critical_mass|Critical_Mass|  of 2839  kg, although with steel  |reflectors|Neutron_Reflector|  this value could drop to 994  kg.  232 Th is not fissionable, but it is  |fertile|Fertile_Material|  as it can be converted to fissile  |_233_U|Uranium_233|  by neutron capture and subsequent beta decay.        Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes:  |uranium–thorium_dating|Uranium–Thorium_Dating| , based on the decay of  |_234_U|Uranium_234|  to 230 Th, and  |ionium–thorium_dating|Ionium–Thorium_Dating| , which measures the ratio of 232 Th to 230 Th. These rely on the fact that 232 Th is a primordial radioisotope, but 230 Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238 U. Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234 U and 230 Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of 235 U into 231 Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231 Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of  |calcium_carbonate|Calcium_Carbonate|  materials such as  |speleothem|Speleothem|  or  |coral|Coral| , because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor  |sediments|Sediment| , where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years.   Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232 Th to 230 Th.   Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230 Th to 232 Th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer.          A thorium atom has 90 electrons, of which four are  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron| . Three  |atomic_orbitals|Atomic_Orbital|  are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thoriums position in the  |f_block|F_Block|  of the periodic table, it has an anomalous d 2 7s 2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thoriums 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilized. This is due to  |relativistic_effects|Relativistic_Effects| , which become stronger near the bottom of the periodic table, specifically the relativistic  |spin–orbit_interaction|Spin–Orbit_Interaction| . The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium results in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, in which +4 is also the highest possible state, but +3 plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the  |transition_metals|Transition_Metal|  zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its ionization energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.           Despite the anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realized in 1995, when it was pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the d 2 7s 2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the  |Fermi_level|Fermi_Level|  should be  |hexagonal_close_packed|Hexagonal_Close_Packed|  like the  |group_4_elements|Group_4_Element|  titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration f 1 .      Tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow, like those of  |silver|Silver|  or lead, as the Th 4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single  |diamagnetic|Diamagnetic|  ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the  |main_group_elements|Main_Group_Element|  of the s-block.   Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.       Thorium is a highly  |reactive|Reactivity|  and electropositive metal. With a  |standard_reduction_potential|Standard_Reduction_Potential|  of −1.90  V for the Th 4+ /Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit  |pyrophoricity|Pyrophoricity| , spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium  |turnings|Swarf|  ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.     At  |standard_temperature_and_pressure|Standard_Temperature_And_Pressure| , thorium is slowly attacked by water, but does not readily dissolve in most common acids, with the exception of  |hydrochloric_acid|Hydrochloric_Acid| , where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThOH.  It dissolves in concentrated  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid|  containing a small quantity of catalytic  |fluoride|Fluoride|  or  |fluorosilicate|Fluorosilicate|  ions;  if these are not present,  |passivation|Passivation|  by the nitrate can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.             Most binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may be prepared by heating the elements together. In air, thorium burns to form ThO 2 , which has the  |fluorite|Fluorite|  structure.  Thorium dioxide is a  |refractory_material|Refractory_Material| , with the highest melting point of any known oxide. It is somewhat  |hygroscopic|Hygroscopic|  and reacts readily with water and many gases; it dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride.     When heated in air, thorium dioxide emits intense blue light; the light becomes white when ThO 2 is mixed with its lighter homologue  |cerium_dioxide|Cerium_Dioxide|  : this is the basis for its previously common application in  |gas_mantles|Gas_Mantle| . A flame is not necessary for this effect: in 1901, it was discovered that a hot Welsbach gas mantle remained at full glow when exposed to a cold unignited mixture of flammable gas and air. The light emitted by thorium dioxide is higher in wavelength than the  |blackbody|Blackbody|  emission expected from  |incandescence|Incandescence|  at the same temperature, an effect called  |candoluminescence|Candoluminescence| . It occurs because ThO 2 : Ce acts as a catalyst for the recombination of  |free_radicals|Free_Radical|  that appear in high concentration in a flame, whose deexcitation releases large amounts of energy. The addition of 1% cerium dioxide, as in gas mantles, heightens the effect by increasing emissivity in the visible region of the spectrum; and because cerium, unlike thorium, can occur in multiple oxidation states, its charge and hence visible emissivity will depend on the region on the flame it is found in .     Several binary thorium  |chalcogen|Chalcogen| ides and oxychalcogenides are also known with  |sulfur|Sulfur| ,  |selenium|Selenium| , and  |tellurium|Tellurium| .     All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as are some low-valent bromides and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a  |monoclinic|Monoclinic_Crystal_System|  crystal structure like those of  |zirconium_tetrafluoride|Zirconium_Tetrafluoride|  and  |hafnium_tetrafluoride|Hafnium_Tetrafluoride| , where the Th 4+ ions are coordinated with F − ions in somewhat distorted  |square_antiprisms|Square_Antiprism| . The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI 3 and ThI 2 can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th and Th, but instead contain Th 4+ and could be more clearly formulated as  |electride|Electride|  compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals,  |barium|Barium| , thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with  |potassium_fluoride|Potassium_Fluoride|  and  |hydrofluoric_acid|Hydrofluoric_Acid| , Th 4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K 2 ThF 6 .     Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and nitrides are refractory materials, like those of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible  |nuclear_fuels|Nuclear_Fuel| . All four heavier  |pnictogens|Pnictogen|   also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH 2 and Th 4 H 15 , the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8  K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.            In an acidic aqueous solution, thorium occurs as the tetrapositive  |aqua_ion|Aqua_Ion|  4+ , which has  |tricapped_trigonal_prismatic_molecular_geometry|Tricapped_Trigonal_Prismatic_Molecular_Geometry|   at pH      3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation. The Th 4+ ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95  and  1.14  Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than  |sulfurous_acid|Sulfurous_Acid| , predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th 4 forms and precipitates out . As a  |hard_Lewis_acid|Hsab_Theory| , Th 4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.      High coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size. Thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the borohydride  has coordination number 14. These thorium salts are known for their high solubility in water and polar organic solvents.     Many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, such as the  |perchlorates|Perchlorate| ,  |sulfates|Sulfate| ,  |sulfites|Sulfite| , nitrates, carbonates,  |phosphates|Phosphate| ,  |vanadates|Vanadate| ,  |molybdates|Molybdate| , and  |chromates|Chromates| , and their hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, but most of them have not yet been fully characterized, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as  |oxalate|Oxalate| ,  |citrate|Citrate| , and  |EDTA|Edta| , are much more stable. In natural thorium-containing waters, organic thorium complexes usually occur in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes, even when the concentrations of inorganic ligands are much greater than those of organic ligands.            Most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the  |cyclopentadienyl_complex|Cyclopentadienyl_Complex| es and  |cyclooctatetraenyls|Cyclooctatetraenide_Anion| . Like many of the early and middle actinides , thorium forms a cyclooctatetraenide complex: the yellow Th 2 ,  |thorocene|Thorocene| . It is  |isotypic|Isotypic|  with the better-known analogous uranium compound  |uranocene|Uranocene| . It can be prepared by reacting  |K_2_C_8_H_8_|Potassium_Cyclooctatetraenide|  with thorium tetrachloride in  |tetrahydrofuran|Tetrahydrofuran|  at the temperature of  |dry_ice|Dry_Ice| , or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC 8 H 8 . It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190  °C.  |Half_sandwich_compounds|Half_Sandwich_Compound|  are also known, such as ThCl 2 2 , which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.     The simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are Th 3 and Th 4 : many derivatives are known. The former is a rare example of thorium in the formal +3 oxidation state; a formal +2 oxidation state occurs in a derivative.  The chloride derivative is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with  |limiting|Limiting_Reagent|  K used . The  |alkyl|Alkyl|  and  |aryl|Aryl|  derivatives are prepared from the chloride derivative and have been used to study the nature of the Th–C  |sigma_bond|Sigma_Bond| .     Other organothorium compounds are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th, and tetraallylthorium, Th 4 , are known, but their structures have not been determined. They decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3− , heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 . Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms , they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th 4 , is not known, but its  |adducts|Adduct|  are stabilised by  |phosphine|Phosphine|  ligands.              232 Th is a primordial nuclide, having existed in its current form for over ten billion years; it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the  |r_process|R_Process|  and scattered across the galaxy by  |supernovae|Supernova|  and  |neutron_star_mergers|Neutron_Star_Merger| .   The letter r stands for rapid neutron capture , and occurs in core-collapse supernovae, where heavy seed nuclei such as  |_56_Fe|Iron_56|  rapidly capture neutrons, running up against the  |neutron_drip_line|Neutron_Drip_Line| , as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability. Neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased  |Coulomb_barriers|Coulomb_Barrier|  that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond 56 Fe is  |endothermic|Endothermic_Process| .  Because of the abrupt loss of stability past 209 Bi, the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create thorium and uranium; all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements.          In the universe, thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements, because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process , and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are  |thulium|Thulium| ,  |lutetium|Lutetium| , tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals, as well as uranium.  In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236 U to 232 Th and the natural depletion of 235 U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.     In the Earths crust, thorium is much more abundant: with an abundance of 8.1   |parts_per_million|Parts_Per_Million|  , it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead and more abundant than tin . This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a  |lithophile|Goldschmidt_Classification| . Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the  |refractory_elements|Refractory_Metals|  have the same relative abundances in the Earth as in the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.               Natural thorium is usually almost pure 232 Th, which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the  |Earths_internal_heat|Earthheat| ; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238 U, 40 K, and 235 U in descending order of their contribution.  Its decay accounts for a gradual decrease of thorium content of the Earth: the planet currently has around 85% of the amount present at the formation of the Earth. The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only 230 Th is usually detectable, occurring in  |secular_equilibrium|Secular_Equilibrium|  with its parent 238 U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.     Thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals, and was for this reason previously thought to be rare. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of thorium.      In nature, thorium occurs in the +4 oxidation state, together with uranium,  |zirconium|Zirconium| , hafnium, and cerium, and also with  |scandium|Scandium| ,  |yttrium|Yttrium| , and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar  |ionic_radii|Ionic_Radius| . Because of thoriums radioactivity, minerals containing it are often  |metamict|Metamictization|  , their crystal structure having been damaged by the alpha radiation produced by thorium.  An extreme example is  |ekanite|Ekanite| , 2 Si 8 O 20 , which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to the thorium it contains.       |Monazite|Monazite|  is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide, principally in India, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and  |Malaysia|Malaysia| . It contains around 2.5% thorium on average, although some deposits may contain up to 20%. Monazite is a chemically unreactive mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand; its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it.  |Allanite|Allanite|  can have 0.1–2% thorium and  |zircon|Zircon|   up to 0.4% thorium.     Thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral  |thorianite|Thorianite| . Due to its being isotypic with  |uranium_dioxide|Uranium_Dioxide| , these two common actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the ThO 2 content.  |Thorite|Thorite|  , also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered. In thorium silicate minerals, the Th 4+ and  ions are often replaced with M 3+ and phosphate  ions respectively. Because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide, thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released. The Th 4+ ion is soluble, especially in acidic soils, and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40  ppm.                 In 1815, the Swedish chemist  |Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|Jöns_Jacob_Berzelius|  analysed an unusual sample of  |gadolinite|Gadolinite|  from a copper mine in  |Falun|Falun| , central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces of a white mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth  of an unknown element. Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but he had made a public mistake once, announcing a new element, gahnium, that turned out to be  |zinc_oxide|Zinc_Oxide| . Berzelius privately named the putative element thorium in 1817  and its supposed oxide thorina after  |Thor|Thor| , the  |Norse_god|Norse_God|  of thunder.  In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in  |Vest_Agder|Vest_Agder| , Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral  proved to be mostly  |yttrium_orthophosphate|Yttrium_Phosphate| .            In 1828,  |Morten_Thrane_Esmark|Morten_Thrane_Esmark|  found a black mineral on  |Løvøya|Løvøya_Telemark|  island,  |Telemark|Telemark|  county, Norway. He was a Norwegian  |priest|Priest|  and amateur  |mineralogist|Mineralogist|  who studied the minerals in Telemark, where he served as  |vicar|Vicar| . He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father,  |Jens_Esmark|Jens_Esmark| , a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the  |Royal_Frederick_University|Royal_Frederick_University|  in Christiania .  The elder Esmark determined that it was not a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF 5 with  |potassium|Potassium|  metal.  .  Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery   and named the source mineral thorite.          Berzelius made some initial characterizations of the new metal and its chemical compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 , but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen ; it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very  |electropositive|Electronegativityelectropositivity|  metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity.  Metallic thorium was isolated for the first time in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.       In the periodic table published by  |Dmitri_Mendeleev|Dmitri_Mendeleev|  in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table, at the end of each vertical period after the  |alkaline_earth_metals|Alkaline_Earth_Metal| . This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which also contained the modern  |carbon_group|Carbon_Group|  and titanium group , because their maximum oxidation state was +4.   Cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as  |titanium|Titanium|  and zirconium.        While thorium was discovered in 1828 its first application dates only from 1885, when Austrian chemist  |Carl_Auer_von_Welsbach|Carl_Auer_Von_Welsbach|  invented the  |gas_mantle|Gas_Mantle| , a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. Many applications were subsequently found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.              Thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist  |Gerhard_Carl_Schmidt|Gerhard_Carl_Schmidt|  and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist  |Marie_Curie|Marie_Curie| . It was the second element that was found to be radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist  |Henri_Becquerel|Henri_Becquerel| .    . Starting from 1899, the New Zealand physicist  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford|  and the American electrical engineer  |Robert_Bowie_Owens|Robert_Bowie_Owens|  studied the radiation from thorium; initial observations showed that it varied significantly. It was determined that these variations came from a short-lived gaseous daughter of thorium, which they found to be a new element. This element is now named  |radon|Radon| , the only one of the rare radioelements to be discovered in nature as a daughter of thorium rather than uranium.  |Frederick_Soddy|Frederick_Soddy| , showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements in work dating from 1900 to 1903. This observation led to the identification of the  |half_life|Half_Life|  as one of the outcomes of the  |alpha_particle|Alpha_Particle|  experiments that led to the disintegration theory of  |radioactivity|Radioactivity| .  The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903.  The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thoriums radioactivity was promoted as a cure for  |rheumatism|Rheumatism| ,  |diabetes|Diabetes| , and  |sexual_impotence|Sexual_Impotence| . In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. 10,000 individuals in the United States had been injected with thorium during X-ray diagnosis; they were later found to suffer health issues such as leukaemia and abnormal chromosomes. Public interest in radioactivity had declined by the end of the 1930s.             Up to the late 19th century, chemists unanimously agreed that thorium and uranium were analogous to hafnium and tungsten; the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row was considered to be a one-off fluke. In 1892, British chemist Henry Bassett postulated a second extra-long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements, considering thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanides. In 1913, Danish physicist  |Niels_Bohr|Niels_Bohr|  published a  |theoretical_model|Bohr_Model|  of the atom and its electron orbitals, which soon gathered wide acceptance. The model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements, like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals. The existence of a second inner transition series, in the form of the actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established; . Bohr suggested that the filling of the 5f orbitals may be delayed to after uranium.     It was only with the discovery of the first  |transuranic_elements|Transuranic_Element| , which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule.  In 1945, when American physicist  |Glenn_T_Seaborg|Glenn_T_Seaborg|  and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of  |hafnium|Hafnium|  filling a fourth d-block row.           In the 1990s, most applications that do not depend on thoriums radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found.  Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the  |Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|  in the United States estimated that using a thorium gas mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, but this was not the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles or for the soils around some factory sites.  Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium.  As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some even falsely claiming them to be non-radioactive.                Thorium has been used as a power source on a prototype scale. The earliest thorium-based reactor was built at the  |Indian_Point_Energy_Center|Indian_Point_Energy_Center|  located in Buchanan, New York, United States in 1962.  One of the largest supplies of thorium in the world is in the country of India, where there is not much uranium. In the 1950s India targeted achieving energy independence with their  |three_stage_nuclear_power_programme|Indias_Three_Stage_Nuclear_Power_Programme| .   In most countries, uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was slow; in the 20th  century, three reactors were built in India and twelve elsewhere.  Large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the  |International_Atomic_Energy_Agency|International_Atomic_Energy_Agency|  to study the use of thorium reactors; a year later, the  |United_States_Department_of_Energy|United_States_Department_Of_Energy|  started their research.  |Alvin_Radkowsky|Alvin_Radkowsky|  of  |Tel_Aviv_University|Tel_Aviv_University|  in Israel was the head designer of  |Shippingport_Atomic_Power_Station|Shippingport_Atomic_Power_Station|  in Pennsylvania, the first American civilian reactor to breed thorium.  He founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors, which included other laboratories:  |Raytheon|Raytheon|  Nuclear Inc. and  |Brookhaven_National_Laboratory|Brookhaven_National_Laboratory|  in the United States, and the  |Kurchatov_Institute|Kurchatov_Institute|  in Russia.  In the 21st  century, thoriums potential for reducing nuclear proliferation and its  |waste|Nuclear_Waste|  characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle.          When gram quantities of  |plutonium|Plutonium|  were first produced in the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project| , it was discovered that a minor isotope  underwent significant  |spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission| , which brought into question the viability of a plutonium-fueled  |gun_type_nuclear_weapon|Gun_Type_Fission_Weapon| . While the  |Los_Alamos|Project_Y|  team began work on the  |implosion_type_weapon|Nuclear_Weapon_Designimplosion_Type_Weapon|  to circumvent this issue, the  |Chicago_team|Metallurgical_Laboratory|  discussed reactor design solutions.  |Eugene_Wigner|Eugene_Wigner|  proposed to use the 240 Pu-contaminated plutonium to drive the conversion of thorium into 233 U in a special converter reactor. It was hypothesized that the 233 U would then be usable in a gun-type weapon, though concerns about contamination from 232 U were voiced. Progress on the implosion weapon was sufficient, and this converter was not developed further, but the design had enormous influence on the development of nuclear energy. It was the first detailed description of a highly-enriched water-cooled, water-moderated reactor similar to future naval and power reactors.      During the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  the United States explored the possibility of using 232 Th as a source of 233 U to be used in a  |nuclear_bomb|Nuclear_Bomb| ; they fired  |a_test_bomb|Operation_Teapotmet|  in 1955.  They concluded that a 233 U-fired bomb would be a very potent weapon, but it bore few sustainable technical advantages over the contemporary uranium–plutonium bombs,  especially since 233 U is difficult to produce in isotopically pure form.     Thorium metal was used in the  |radiation_case|Hohlraum|  of at least one nuclear weapon design deployed by the United States .                 The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of production of other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose.  Present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.  In 2014, world production of the monazite concentrate, from which thorium would be extracted, was 2,700 tonnes.      The common production route of thorium constitutes concentration of thorium minerals; extraction of thorium from the concentrate; purification of thorium; and conversion to compounds, such as thorium dioxide.       There are two categories of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits occur at the mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals. Initial concentration varies with the type of deposit.     For the primary deposits, the source pegmatites, which are usually obtained by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo  |flotation|Froth_Flotation| . Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with  |hydrogen_chloride|Hydrogen_Chloride| ; then follow  |thickening|Thickening| , filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, with a series of magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.     Industrial production in the 20th century relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.       Acid digestion is a two-stage process, involving the use of up to 93%  |sulfuric_acid|Sulfuric_Acid|  at 210–230  °C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300  °C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot be added to the acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200  °C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70  °C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.       Alkaline digestion is carried out in 30–45%  |sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  solution at about 140  °C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads to the formation of poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45  μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as  |sodium_diuranate|Sodium_Diuranate| , and phosphate as  |trisodium_phosphate|Trisodium_Phosphate| . This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60  °C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of  |silicon_dioxide|Silicon_Dioxide|  in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are dissolved at 80  °C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium formed can liberate free  |chlorine|Chlorine|  from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates.  |Solvent_extraction|Solvent_Extraction|  may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of  |titanium_hydroxide|Titanium_Hydroxide|  is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.       High thorium concentrations are needed in nuclear applications. In particular, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture  |cross_sections|Cross_Section|  must be very low . Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective  |complexation|Complexation|  of Th 4+ are used. For example, following alkaline digestion and the removal of phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with  |tributyl_phosphate|Tributyl_Phosphate|  in  |kerosene|Kerosene| .       Non-radioactivity-related uses have been in decline since the 1950s due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products.     Most thorium applications use its dioxide , rather than the metal. This compound has a melting point of 3300  °C , the highest of all known oxides; only a few substances have higher melting points. This helps the compound remain solid in a flame, and it considerably increases the brightness of the flame; this is the main reason thorium is used in gas mantles. All substances emit energy at high temperatures, but the light emitted by thorium is nearly all in the  |visible_spectrum|Visible_Spectrum| , hence the brightness of thorium mantles.  Energy, some of it in the form of visible light, is emitted when thorium is exposed to a source of energy itself, such as a cathode ray, heat or  |ultraviolet_light|Ultraviolet_Light| . This effect is shared by cerium dioxide, which converts ultraviolet light into visible light more efficiently, but thorium dioxide gives a higher flame temperature, emitting less  |infrared_light|Infrared_Light| . Thorium in mantles, though still common, has been progressively replaced with yttrium since the late 1990s.  According to the 2005 review by the United Kingdoms  |National_Radiological_Protection_Board|National_Radiological_Protection_Board| , although were widely available a few years ago, they are not any more.           During the production of  |incandescent|Incandescent|  filaments,  |recrystallisation|Recrystallization|  of tungsten is significantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten  |sintering|Sintering|  powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten  |thermocathodes|Hot_Cathode|  considerably reduces the  |work_function|Work_Function|  of electrons; as a result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Thorium forms a one-atom-thick layer on the surface of tungsten. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thoriums greater electropositivity.  Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also acts as a  |getter|Getter|  for impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in  |gas_tungsten_arc_welding|Gas_Tungsten_Arc_Welding|  to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and  |lanthanum|Lanthanum| .       Thorium dioxide is found in  |heat_resistant|Refraction|  ceramics, such as high-temperature laboratory  |crucibles|Crucible| , either as the primary ingredient or as an addition to  |zirconium_dioxide|Zirconium_Dioxide| . An alloy of 90%  |platinum|Platinum|  and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising  |ammonia|Ammonia|  to nitrogen oxides, but this has been replaced by an alloy of 95% platinum and 5%  |rhodium|Rhodium|  because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.     When added to  |glass|Glass| , thorium dioxide helps increase its  |refractive_index|Refractive_Index|  and decrease  |dispersion|Dispersion| . Such glass finds application in high-quality  |lenses|Lens|  for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and it degrades film, but the health risks are minimal.  Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.     Thorium tetrafluoride is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings. It is transparent to electromagnetic waves having wavelengths in the range of 0.35–12  µm, a range that includes near ultraviolet, visible and  |mid_infrared|Infrared|  light. Its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material.  Replacements for thorium tetrafluoride are being developed as of the 2010s.       |Mag_Thor|Mag_Thor|  alloys found use in some aerospace applications, though such uses have been phased out due to concerns over radioactivity.       The main nuclear power source in a reactor is the neutron-induced fission of a nuclide; the synthetic fissile nuclei 233 U and 239 Pu can be  |bred|Breeder_Reactor|  from neutron capture by the naturally occurring quantity nuclides 232 Th and 238 U. 235 U occurs naturally and is also fissile.    In the thorium fuel cycle, the fertile isotope 232 Th is bombarded by  |slow_neutrons|Slow_Neutron| , undergoing neutron capture to become 233 Th, which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first  |_233_Pa|Protactinium_233|  and then the fissile 233 U:     : + n →  +             233 U is fissile and can be used as a nuclear fuel in the same way as 235 U or  |_239_Pu|Plutonium_239| . When 233 U undergoes nuclear fission, the neutrons emitted can strike further 232 Th nuclei, continuing the cycle. This parallels the uranium fuel cycle in  |fast_breeder_reactors|Fast_Breeder_Reactor|  where 238 U undergoes neutron capture to become 239 U, beta decaying to first 239 Np and then fissile 239 Pu.        Thorium is more abundant than uranium and can satisfy world energy demands for longer.     232 Th absorbs neutrons more readily than 238 U, and 233 U has a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture than 235 U or 239 Pu .  It also releases more neutrons upon fission on average. A single neutron capture by 238 U produces transuranic waste along with the fissile 239 Pu, but 232 Th only produces this waste after five captures, forming 237 Np. This number of captures does not happen for 98–99% of the 232 Th nuclei because the intermediate products 233 U or 235 U undergo fission, and fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in  |mixed_oxide_fuels|Mox_Fuel|  to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium.      Thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing  |reactor_core|Reactor_Core|  because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher  |thermal_conductivity|Thermal_Conductivity| , and a lower  |coefficient_of_thermal_expansion|Coefficient_Of_Thermal_Expansion|  and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to  |triuranium_octoxide|Triuranium_Octoxide|  .        The used fuel is difficult and dangerous to reprocess because many of the daughters of 232 Th and 233 U are strong gamma emitters. All 233 U production methods result in impurities of  |_232_U|Uranium_232| , either from parasitic knock-out reactions on 232 Th, 233 Pa, or 233 U that result in the loss of a neutron, or from double neutron capture of 230 Th, an impurity in natural 232 Th:   : + n →  +       + n →  +        232 U by itself is not particularly harmful, but quickly decays to produce the strong gamma emitter 208 Tl.  These impurities of 232 U make 233 U easy to detect and dangerous to work on, and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of  |nuclear_proliferation|Nuclear_Proliferation|  using 233 U as the fissile material.  233 Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27  days and a high  |cross_section|Cross_Section|  for neutron capture. Thus it is a  |neutron_poison|Neutron_Poison| |the_reactor_efficiency|Neutron_Economy| . To avoid this, 233 Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium  |molten_salt_reactors|Molten_Salt_Reactor|  during their operation, so that it does not have a chance to capture a neutron and will only decay to 233 U.      The irradiation of 232 Th with neutrons, followed by its processing, need to be mastered before these advantages can be realised, and this requires more advanced technology than the uranium and plutonium fuel cycle; research continues in this area. Others cite the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle:    the international  |Nuclear_Energy_Agency|Nuclear_Energy_Agency|  predicts that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance—a situation which may persist in the coming decades .  The isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are mostly not transuranic, but some of them are still very dangerous, such as 231 Pa, which has a half-life of 32,760  years and is a major contributor to the long-term  |radiotoxic|Radiotoxic| ity of spent nuclear fuel.                Natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials, and the emitted  |alpha_radiation|Alpha_Radiation|  cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, such as those in gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks.  Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of  |cancers|Cancer|  of the  |lung|Lung| ,  |pancreas|Pancreas| , and  |blood|Blood| , as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Internal exposure to thorium leads to increased risk of  |liver|Liver|  diseases.     The decay products of 232 Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products are created as the result of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232 Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous  |gamma|Gamma_Radiation|  emitters,  and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232 Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224 Ra, 228 Ra, 212 Pb, and 212 Bi are released.  Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2   |millisieverts|Sievert|  per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a  |mammogram|Mammogram| .      Some  |nuclear_safety|Nuclear_Safety|  agencies make recommendations about the use of thorium mantles and have raised safety concerns regarding their  |manufacture|Gas_Mantlesafety_Concerns|  and disposal; the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem, but that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is.        Thorium is odourless and tasteless.  The chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds are poorly soluble in water,  precipitating out before entering the body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately  |toxic|Toxic| , especially in the presence of strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If a thorium-containing object has been chewed or sucked, it loses 0.4% of thorium and 90% of its dangerous daughters to the body. Three quarters of the thorium that has penetrated the body accumulates in the  |skeleton|Skeleton| . Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thoriums low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.     Tests on the thorium uptake of workers involved in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no adverse effects on health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the  |tracheobronchial_tract|Tracheobronchial_Tract|  and the lungs from exposure to thorium. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of  |dermatitis|Dermatitis| . It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves. Thorium has no known biological role.       Powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric: it ignites spontaneously in air. In 1964, the  |United_States_Department_of_the_Interior|United_States_Department_Of_The_Interior|  listed thorium as severe on a table entitled Ignition and explosibility of metal powders . Its ignition temperature was given as 270  °C for dust clouds and 280  °C for layers. Its minimum explosive concentration was listed as 0.075  oz/cu ft ; the minimum igniting energy for dust was listed as 5   |mJ|Joule| .      In 1956, the  |Sylvania_Electric_Products_explosion|Sylvania_Electric_Products_Explosion|  occurred during reprocessing and burning of thorium sludge in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , United States. Nine people were injured; one died of complications caused by  |third_degree_burns|Third_Degree_Burns| .          Thorium exists in very small quantities everywhere on Earth although larger amounts exist in certain parts: the average human contains about 40   |micrograms|Microgram|  of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes with food and water, but because of its low solubility, this exposure is negligible.     Exposure is raised for people who live near thorium deposits or radioactive waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, and for those who work in gas mantle production.  Thorium is especially common in the  |Tamil_Nadu|Tamil_Nadu|  coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average.  It is also common in northern Brazilian coastal areas, from south Bahia to  |Guarapari|Guarapari| , a city with radioactive monazite sand beaches, with radiation levels up to 50 times higher than world average background radiation.      Another possible source of exposure is thorium dust produced at weapons testing ranges, as thorium is used in the guidance systems of some missiles. This has been blamed for a high incidence of birth defects and cancer at  |Salto_di_Quirra|Salto_Di_Quirra|  on the Italian island of Sardinia.
