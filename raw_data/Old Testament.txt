           The Old Testament  is the first part of the  |Christian_biblical_canon|Christian_Biblical_Canons| , which is based primarily upon the twenty-four books of the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible|  , a collection of ancient religious Hebrew writings by the  |Israelites|Israelites|  believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred  |Word_of_God|Authorship_Of_The_Bible| . The second part of  |Christian_Bibles|Biblechristian_Bibles|  is the  |New_Testament|New_Testament| , originally written in the  |Koine_Greek|Koine_Greek|  language.     The  |books_that_comprise_the_Old_Testament_canon|Books_Of_The_Bible| , as well as their order and names, differ between  |Christian_denominations|Christian_Denominations| . The  |Catholic|Catholic_Bible|  canon comprises 46 books, the canons of the  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox_Church|  and  |Oriental_Orthodox|Oriental_Orthodoxy|  Churches comprise up to 49 books, and the most common  |Protestant|Protestant_Bible|  canon comprises 39 books. The 39 books in common to all the Christian canons correspond to the 24 books of the Tanakh, with some differences of order, and there are some differences in text. The additional number reflects the splitting of several texts  into separate books in Christian bibles.     The books which are part of a Christian Old Testament but which are not part of the Hebrew canon are sometimes described as  |deuterocanonical|Deuterocanonical_Books| . In general,  |Protestant_Bibles|Protestant_Bible|  do not include the deuterocanonical books in their canon, but some versions of  |Anglican|Anglican|  and  |Lutheran|Lutheran|  bibles place such books in a separate section called  |Apocrypha|Biblical_Apocrypha| . These extra books are ultimately derived from the earlier  |Greek_Septuagint|Greek_Septuagint|  collection of the Hebrew scriptures and are also Jewish in origin. Some are also contained in the  |Dead_Sea_Scrolls|Dead_Sea_Scrolls| .     The Old Testament consists of many distinct books  |by_various_authors|Authorship_Of_The_Bible|  produced over a period of centuries.  Christians traditionally divide the Old Testament into four sections: the first five books or Pentateuch ; the history books telling the history of the  |Israelites|Israelites| , from their  |conquest_of_Canaan|Conquest_Of_Canaan|  to their  |defeat_and_exile_in_Babylon|Babylonian_Exile| ; the poetic and  |Wisdom_books|Sapiential_Books|  dealing, in various forms, with questions of good and evil in the world; and the books of the biblical prophets, warning of the consequences of turning away from God.            The Old Testament contains 39 , 46 , or more books, divided, very broadly, into the  |Pentateuch_|Torah| , the historical books, the  |_wisdom_books|Sapiential_Books|  and the prophets.       The table uses the spellings and names present in modern editions of the Christian Bible, such as the Catholic  |New_American_Bible_Revised_Edition|New_American_Bible_Revised_Edition|  and the Protestant  |Revised_Standard_Version|Revised_Standard_Version|  and  |English_Standard_Version|English_Standard_Version| . The spelling and names in both the 1609–10  |Douay|Douay_Rheims_Bible|  Old Testament and the 1749 revision by  |Bishop_Challoner|Bishop_Challoner|  and in the Septuagint differ from those spellings and names used in modern editions which are derived from the Hebrew Masoretic text.     For the  |Orthodox_canon|Eastern_Greek_Orthodox_Bible| , Septuagint titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. For the Catholic canon, the Douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. Likewise, the King James Version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the New Testament, such as Esaias .     In the spirit of  |ecumenism|Ecumenism|  more recent  |Catholic_translations|Catholic_Biblecatholic_English_Versions|   use the same standardized spellings and names as  |Protestant_Bibles|Protestant_Bible|  in those books which are universally considered canonical, the  |protocanonicals|Protocanonical_Books| .     The  |Talmud|Talmud|  in  |Bava_Batra|Bava_Batra|  14b gives a different order for the books in Neviim and Ketuvim. This order is also cited in  |Mishneh_Torah|Mishneh_Torah|  Hilchot  |Sefer|Sefer| |_Torah|Torah|  7:15. The order of the books of the Torah is universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.     The disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the  |Biblical_apocrypha|Biblical_Apocrypha| , a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern  |Protestant|Protestant|  Bibles. Catholics, following the  |Canon_of_Trent|Canon_Of_Trent|  , describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the  |Synod_of_Jerusalem_|Synod_Of_Jerusalem| , use the traditional name of  anagignoskomena , meaning that which is to be read. They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German  |Luther_Bible|Luther_Bible|  included such books, as did the English  |1611_King_James_Version|Authorized_King_James_Version| .     Empty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.          Several of the books in the Eastern Orthodox canon are also found in the appendix to the Latin Vulgate, formerly the official bible of the Roman Catholic Church.              The first five books –  |Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis| ,  |Exodus|Book_Of_Exodus| ,  |Leviticus|Leviticus| ,  |book_of_Numbers|Book_Of_Numbers|  and  |Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy|  – reached their present form in the  |Persian_period_|Yehud_Medinata| , and their authors were the elite of exilic returnees who controlled the  |Temple_at_that_time|Second_Temple| . The books of  |Joshua|Book_Of_Joshua| ,  |Judges|Book_Of_Judges| ,  |Samuel|Books_Of_Samuel|  and  |Kings|Books_Of_Kings|  follow, forming a history of Israel from the  |Conquest_of_Canaan|Conquest_Of_Canaan|  to the  |Siege_of_Jerusalem_c_587_BC|Siege_Of_Jerusalem| . There is a broad consensus among scholars that these originated as a single work  during the  |Babylonian_exile|Babylonian_Exile|  of the 6th century BC.   The two  |Books_of_Chronicles|Books_Of_Chronicles|  cover much the same material as the Pentateuch and Deuteronomistic history and probably date from the 4th century BC. Chronicles, and  |Ezra–Nehemiah|Ezra–Nehemiah| , were probably finished during the 3rd century BC. Catholic and Orthodox Old Testaments contain two to four  |Books_of_Maccabees|Books_Of_Maccabees| , written in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.     These history books make up around half the total content of the Old Testament. Of the remainder, the books of the various prophets –  |Isaiah|Book_Of_Isaiah| ,  |Jeremiah|Book_Of_Jeremiah| ,  |Ezekiel|Book_Of_Ezekiel| , and the twelve  |minor_prophets|Minor_Prophets|  – were written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, with the exceptions of  |Jonah|Book_Of_Jonah|  and  |Daniel|Book_Of_Daniel| , which were written much later. The wisdom books –  |Job|Book_Of_Job| ,  |Proverbs|Book_Of_Proverbs| ,  |Ecclesiastes|Book_Of_Ecclesiastes| ,  |Psalms|Book_Of_Psalms| ,  |Song_of_Solomon|Book_Of_Song_Of_Solomon|  – have various dates: Proverbs possibly was completed by the Hellenistic time , though containing much older material as well; Job completed by the 6th century BC; Ecclesiastes by the 3rd century BC.         God is consistently depicted as the one who created the world. Although the God of the Old Testament is not consistently presented as  |the_only_God_who_exists|Monotheism| , he is always depicted as  |the_only_God_whom_Israel_is_to_worship|Monolatrism| , or the one true God , that only  |Yahweh|Yahweh|  is Almighty, and both Jews and Christians have always interpreted the Bible as an affirmation of the oneness of Almighty God.     The Old Testament stresses the special relationship between God and his  |chosen_people|Chosen_People| , Israel, but includes instructions for  |proselytes|Proselyte|  as well. This relationship is expressed in the  |biblical_covenant|Biblical_Covenant|   between the two, received by Moses. The law codes in books such as  |Exodus|Book_Of_Exodus|  and especially  |Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy|  are the terms of the contract: Israel swears faithfulness to  |God|Tetragrammaton| , and God swears to be Israels special protector and supporter. The Jewish Study Bible denies that covenant means contract.     Further themes in the Old Testament include  |salvation|Salvation| ,  |redemption|Redemption| ,  |divine_judgment|Divine_Judgment| , obedience and disobedience,  |faith|Faith|  and faithfulness, among others. Throughout there is a strong emphasis on  |ethics|Ethics|  and  |ritual_purity|Ritual_Purity| , both of which God demands, although some of the prophets and wisdom writers seem to question this, arguing that God demands  |social_justice|Social_Justice|  above purity, and perhaps does not even care about purity at all. The Old Testaments moral code enjoins fairness, intervention on behalf of the vulnerable, and the duty of those in power to administer justice righteously. It forbids murder, bribery and corruption, deceitful trading, and many  |sexual_misdemeanors|Porneia| . All morality is traced back to God, who is the source of all goodness.     The  |problem_of_evil|Problem_Of_Evil|  plays a large part in the Old Testament. The problem the Old Testament authors faced was that a good God must have had just reason for bringing disaster  upon his people. The theme is played out, with many variations, in books as different as the histories of Kings and Chronicles, the prophets like Ezekiel and Jeremiah, and in the wisdom books like Job and Ecclesiastes.                    The process by which scriptures became canons and Bibles was a long one, and its complexities account for the many different Old Testaments which exist today. Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the  |University_of_Edinburgh|University_Of_Edinburgh| , identifies the Old Testament as a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing. He states that it is not a magical book, nor was it literally written by  |God|God_In_Judaism|  and passed to mankind. By about the 5th century BC Jews saw the five books of the  |Torah|Torah|  as having authoritative status; by the 2nd century BC the Prophets had a similar status, although without quite the same level of respect as the Torah; beyond that, the Jewish scriptures were fluid, with different groups seeing authority in different books.            Hebrew texts commenced to be translated into Greek in  |Alexandria|Alexandria|  in about 280 and continued until about 130 BC. These early Greek translations  supposedly commissioned by  |Ptolemy_Philadelphus|Ptolemy_Ii|   were called the  |Septuagint|Septuagint|  from the supposed number of translators involved . This Septuagint remains the basis of the Old Testament in the  |Eastern_Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodoxy| .     It varies in many places from the  |Masoretic_Text|Masoretic_Text|  and includes numerous books no longer considered canonical in some traditions: 1 and 2  |Esdras|Esdras| ,  |Judith|Judith| ,  |Tobit|Book_Of_Tobit| , 3 and 4  |Maccabees|Books_Of_The_Maccabees| , the  |Book_of_Wisdom|Book_Of_Wisdom| ,  |Sirach|Sirach| , and  |Baruch|Book_Of_Baruch| . Early modern  |Biblical_criticism|Biblical_Criticism|  typically explained these variations as intentional or ignorant corruptions by the Alexandrian scholars, but most recent scholarship holds it is simply based on early source texts differing from those later used by the  |Masoretes|Masoretes|  in their work.     The Septuagint was originally used by  |Hellenized|Hellenization|  Jews whose knowledge of  |Greek|Koine_Greek|  was better than Hebrew. But the texts came to be used predominantly by gentile converts to Christianity and by the early Church as its scripture, Greek being the lingua franca of the early Church. The three most acclaimed early interpreters were  |Aquila_of_Sinope|Aquila_Of_Sinope| ,  |Symmachus_the_Ebionite|Symmachus_The_Ebionite| , and  |Theodotion|Theodotion| ; in his  |Hexapla|Hexapla| ,  |Origen|Origen|  placed his edition of the Hebrew text beside  |its_transcription_in_Greek_letters|Secunda|  and four parallel translations: Aquilas, Symmachuss, the Septuagints, and Theodotions. The so-called fifth and sixth editions were two other Greek translations supposedly miraculously discovered by students outside the towns of  |Jericho|Jericho|  and  |Nicopolis|Nicopolis| https://books.google.com/books?id-L5UAAAAYAAJ & pgPA406 A complete history of the lives, acts, and martyrdoms of the holy apostles, and the two evangelists, St. Mark and Luke, Vol. II. Wiatt , 1810. Retrieved 6 Feb 2013.     In 331,  |Constantine_I|Constantine_I_And_Christianity|  commissioned  |Eusebius|Eusebius|  to deliver  |fifty_Bibles|Fifty_Bibles_Of_Constantine|  for the  |Church_of_Constantinople|Church_Of_Constantinople| .  |Athanasius|Athanasius|  Apol. Const. 4 recorded  |Alexandrian|Early_Centers_Of_Christianityalexandria|  scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for  |Constans|Constans| . Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that  |Codex_Vaticanus|Codex_Vaticanus|  and  |Codex_Sinaiticus|Codex_Sinaiticus|  are examples of these Bibles. Together with the  |Peshitta|Peshitta|  and  |Codex_Alexandrinus|Codex_Alexandrinus| , these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles. The Canon Debate, pp. 414–15, for the entire paragraph There is no evidence among the  |canons_of_the_First_Council_of_Nicaea|First_Council_Of_Nicaeathe_Biblical_Canon|  of any determination on the canon. However,  |Jerome|Jerome|  , in his Prologue to Judith, makes the claim that the  |Book_of_Judith|Book_Of_Judith|  was found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures .  Canonicity: ... the Synod of Nicaea is said to have accounted it as Sacred Scripture . It is true that no such declaration is to be found in the Canons of Nicaea, and it is uncertain whether St. Jerome is referring to the use made of the book in the discussions of the council, or whether he was misled by some spurious canons attributed to that council .            In  |Western_Christianity|Western_Christianity|  or Christianity in the  |Western_half_of_the_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire| , Latin had displaced Greek as the common language of the early Christians, and in 382 AD  |Pope_Damasus_I|Pope_Damasus_I|  commissioned  |Jerome|Jerome| , the leading scholar of the day, to produce an updated Latin bible to replace the  |Vetus_Latina|Vetus_Latina| , which was a Latin translation of the Septuagint. Jeromes work, called the  |Vulgate|Vulgate| , was a direct translation from Hebrew, since he argued for the superiority of  |the_Hebrew_texts|Development_Of_The_Hebrew_Bible_Canon|  in correcting the Septuagint on both philological and theological grounds. Rebenich, S., Jerome , p. 58.  His Vulgate Old Testament became the standard bible used in the Western Church, specifically as the  |Sixto_Clementine_Vulgate|Sixto_Clementine_Vulgate| , while the  |Churches_in_the_East|Eastern_Christianity|  continued, and still continue, to use the Septuagint.     Jerome, however, in the  |Vulgates_prologues|Vulgateprologues|  describes some portions of books in the Septuagint not found in the Hebrew Bible as being non- |canonical|Biblical_Canon|  ;  for  Baruch , he mentions by name in his Prologue to Jeremiah and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or not in the canon .  The  |Synod_of_Hippo|Synod_Of_Hippo|  , followed by the  |Council_of_Carthage_|Council_Of_Carthage|  and the  |Council_of_Carthage_|Council_Of_Carthage| , may be the first council that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes the books that did not appear in the  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| ; McDonald & Sanders, editors of The Canon Debate, 2002, chapter 5: The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism by Albert C. Sundberg Jr., page 72, Appendix D-2, note 19. the councils were under significant influence of  |Augustine_of_Hippo|Augustine_Of_Hippo| , who regarded the canon as already closed. Everett Ferguson, Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon , in The Canon Debate. eds. L. M. McDonald & J. A. Sanders p. 320; F. F. Bruce, The Canon of Scripture p. 230; cf. Augustine, De Civitate Dei 22.8       In the 16th century, the Protestant reformers sided with Jerome; yet although most Protestant Bibles now have only those books that appear in the Hebrew Bible, the order is that of the Greek Bible.     Rome then officially adopted a canon, the  |Canon_of_Trent|Canon_Of_Trent| , which is seen as following Augustines Carthaginian Councils  or the  |Council_of_Rome|Council_Of_Rome| ,   and includes most, but not all, of the Septuagint ; the  |Anglicans|Anglican|  after the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War|  adopted a compromise position, restoring the  |39_Articles|39_Articles|  and keeping the extra books that were excluded by the  |Westminster_Confession_of_Faith|Westminster_Confession_Of_Faith| , but only for private study and for  |reading_in_churches|Anglican_Liturgy| , while  |Lutherans|Lutheran|  kept them for private study, gathered in an appendix as  |Biblical_Apocrypha|Biblical_Apocrypha| .         While the Hebrew, Greek and Latin versions of the Hebrew Bible are the best known Old Testaments, there were others. At much the same time as the Septuagint was being produced, translations were being made into Aramaic, the language of Jews living in Palestine and the Near East and likely the  |language_of_Jesus|Aramaic_Of_Jesus| |Targums|Targum| , from a word meaning translation , and were used to help Jewish congregations understand their scriptures.     For Aramaic Christians there was a  |Syriac|Syriac_Language|  translation of the Hebrew Bible called the  |Peshitta|Peshitta| , as well as versions in  |Coptic|Coptic_Language|  ,  |Ethiopic|Ethiopic|  ,  |Armenian|Armenian_People|  , and  |Arabic|Arabic| .            Christianity is based on the belief that the  |historical_Jesus|Historical_Jesus|  is also the  |Christ|Christ| , as in the  |Confession_of_Peter|Confession_Of_Peter| . This belief is in turn based on Jewish understandings of the meaning of the Hebrew term  |messiah|Messiah| , which, like the Greek Christ , means anointed . In the Hebrew Scriptures it describes a king anointed with oil on his accession to the throne: he becomes The s anointed or  |Yahwehs|Yahweh|  Anointed. By the time of Jesus, some Jews expected that a flesh and blood descendant of David  would come to establish a real Jewish kingdom in Jerusalem, instead of the  |Roman_province|Iudaea_Province| .     Others stressed the  |Son_of_Man|Son_Of_Man| , a distinctly other-worldly figure who would appear as a  |judge_at_the_end_of_time|Last_Judgment| ; and some harmonised the two by expecting a this-worldly messianic kingdom which would last for a set period and be followed by the other-worldly age or  |World_to_Come|World_To_Come| . Some thought the Messiah was already present, but unrecognised due to Israels sins; some thought that the Messiah would be announced by a fore-runner, probably  |Elijah|Elijah|  . None predicted a Messiah who suffers and dies for the sins of all the people. The story of Jesus death therefore involved a profound shift in meaning from the tradition of the Old Testament.     The name Old Testament reflects Christianitys understanding of itself as the  |fulfillment|Supersessionism|  of Jeremiahs prophecy of a  |New_Covenant|New_Covenant|  to replace the existing  |covenant|Covenant|  between God and Israel . The emphasis, however, has shifted from Judaisms understanding of the covenant as a racially or tribally-based contract between God and Jews to one between God and any person of faith who is in Christ .
