A typical example of Simmons intermingling of genres is  Song of Kali  , winner of the  |World_Fantasy_Award|World_Fantasy_Award| . He also writes mysteries and  |thrillers|Thriller| , some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.       Born in  |Peoria_Illinois|Peoria_Illinois| , Simmons received a  |B_A_|B_A_|  in English from  |Wabash_College|Wabash_College|  in 1970 and, in 1971, a  |Masters_in_Education|Masters_In_Education|  from  |Washington_University_in_St_Louis|Washington_University_In_St_Louis| .      He soon started writing short stories, although his career did not take off until 1982, when, through  |Harlan_Ellisons|Harlan_Ellison|  help, his short story  |The_River_Styx_Runs_Upstream|Prayers_To_Broken_Stones_The_River_Styx_Runs_Upstream|  was published and awarded first prize in a  Twilight Zone Magazine  story competition. Simmons first novel, Song of Kali, was released in 1985.     He worked in elementary education until 1989.        Summer of Night  recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s, to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven,  |Illinois|Illinois| . The novel, which was praised by  |Stephen_King|Stephen_King|  in a cover blurb, is similar to Kings  It  in its focus on small town life, the corruption of innocence, the return of an ancient evil, and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood.     In the sequel to Summer of Night,  A Winter Haunting  , Dale Stewart , revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life.     Between the publication of Summer of Night and A Winter Haunting , several additional characters from Summer of Night appeared in:  Children of the Night  , a loose sequel to Summer of Night, which features Mike ORourke, now much older and a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city;  Fires of Eden  , in which the adult Cordie Cooke appears; and Darwins Blade , a thriller in which Dales younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character.       Soon after  Summer of Night  , Simmons, who had written mostly horror fiction, began to focus on writing science fiction, although in 2007 he returned with a work of  |historical_fiction|Historical_Fiction|  and horror,  The Terror . In 2009, he published another book,  Drood , based on the last years of  |Charles_Dickens|Charles_Dickens|  life leading up to the writing of  The Mystery of Edwin Drood , which Dickens had partially completed at the time of his death.        The Terror  crosses the bridge between horror and historical fiction. It is a fictionalized account of Sir  |John_Franklin|John_Franklin|  and  |his_expedition|Franklins_Lost_Expedition|  to find the  |Northwest_Passage|Northwest_Passage| . The two ships,  and , become icebound the first winter, and the captains and crew struggle to survive while being stalked across an Arctic landscape by a monster.     The Abominable recounts a mid-1920s attempt on  |Mount_Everest|Mount_Everest|  by five climbers—two English, one French, one Sherpa, and one American —to recover the body of one of the English characters cousin.        Many of Simmons works have strong ties with classic literature. For example:   His  |1989|1989_In_Literature|  novel Hyperion, winner of Hugo and  |Locus_Awards|Locus_Award|  for the best science fiction novel, deals with a space war and is inspired in its structure by  |Boccaccios|Giovanni_Boccaccio|   Decameron  and  |Chaucers|Chaucer|   Canterbury Tales .  Hyperion Cantos  take their titles from poems by the English Romantic  |John_Keats|John_Keats| .    The title of  Carrion Comfort , as well as many of its themes, derives from the poem Carrion Comfort by  |Gerard_Manley_Hopkins|Gerard_Manley_Hopkins| .    In  The Fall of Hyperion ,  |John_Keats|John_Keats|  himself appears as one of the main characters, with references to characters in  Forbidden Planet  and  The Time Machine .  |televangelists|Televangelist|  and included in  Prayers to Broken Stones , is about a brief return to earth by the title character, an inhabitant of  |Dantes|Dante|   Inferno   |The_Hollow_Man|The_Hollow_Man|  is a novel influenced by Dantes Inferno and  |T_S_Eliot|T_S_Eliot|     The Great Lover is a short story inspired by the  |World_War_I|World_War_I| |_War_Poets|War_Poets|     The  Ilium/Olympos  cycle is inspired by  |Homers|Homer|  works, as well as  |Shakespeare|Shakespeare|  and  |Marcel_Proust|Marcel_Proust| , and the character Ada and her home Ardis Hall are inspired by  |Vladimir_Nabokovs|Vladimir_Nabokov|  novel  Ada or Ardor , which was one of Nabokovs forays into the science fiction genre and alternate history Worlds Enough & Time, takes its name from the first line of the poem  To His Coy Mistress  by British poet Andrew Marvell: Had we but world enough, and time Marvell, A. .
