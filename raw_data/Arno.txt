The river originates on  |Mount_Falterona|Mount_Falterona|  in the  |Casentino|Casentino|  area of the  |Apennines|Apennine_Mountains| , and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near  |Arezzo|Arezzo|  passing through  |Florence|Florence| ,  |Empoli|Empoli|  and  |Pisa|Pisa| , flowing into the  |Tyrrhenian_Sea|Tyrrhenian_Sea|  at  |Marina_di_Pisa|Marina_Di_Pisa| .     With a length of , it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries:  |Sieve|Sieve|  at  long,  |Bisenzio|Bisenzio|  at , and the  |Era|Era| ,  |Elsa|Elsa| ,  |Pesa|Pesa| , and  |Pescia|Pescia| . The drainage basin amounts to more than  and drains the waters of the following subbasins:     The  |Casentino|Casentino| , in the  |province_of_Arezzo|Province_Of_Arezzo| , formed by the upper course of the river until its confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.   The  |Val_di_Chiana|Valdichiana| , a plain drained in the 18th century, which until then had been a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.   The upper  |Valdarno|Valdarno| , a long valley bordered on the east by the  |Pratomagno|Pratomagno|  massif and on the west by the hills around  |Siena|Siena| .   The Sieves basin, which flows into the Arno immediately before Florence.   The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence,  |Sesto_Fiorentino|Sesto_Fiorentino| ,  |Prato|Prato| , and  |Pistoia|Pistoia| .   The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa, and Era and in which, after  |Pontedera|Pontedera| , the Arno flows into the  |Ligurian_Sea|Ligurian_Sea| .

The river  |flood|Flood| ed this city regularly in historical times, most recently in  |1966|1966_Flood_Of_The_Arno| , with  after rainfall of  in Badia Agnano and  in Florence, in only 24 hours.     Before Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte. This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the  |Lago_di_Bientina|Lago_Di_Bientina| , which was once the largest lake in  |Tuscany|Tuscany|  before its reclamation.     The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between . New  |dams|Dam|  built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.     The  |flood_on_November_4_1966|1966_Flood_Of_The_Arno|  collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books. New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.        From Latin Arnus .
