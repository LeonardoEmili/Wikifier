In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the harmonic mean  is one of several kinds of  |average|Average| , and in particular one of the  |Pythagorean_means|Pythagorean_Means| . Typically, it is appropriate for situations when the average of  |rates|Rate|  is desired.     The harmonic mean can be expressed as the  |reciprocal|Multiplicative_Inverse|  of the  |arithmetic_mean|Arithmetic_Mean|  of the reciprocals of the given set of observations. As a simple example, the harmonic mean of 1, 4, and 4 is   :       2          The harmonic mean H of the positive  |real_numbers|Real_Number|    x1, x2,   xn is defined to be     : H           The third formula in the above equation expresses the harmonic mean as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals.     From the following formula:     : H       it is more apparent that the harmonic mean is related to the  |arithmetic|Arithmetic_Mean|  and  |geometric_means|Geometric_Mean| . It is the reciprocal  |dual|Dual|  of the  |arithmetic_mean|Arithmetic_Mean|  for positive inputs:     : 1/H A     The harmonic mean is a  |Schur-concave|Schur-Concave|  function, and dominated by the minimum of its arguments, in the sense that for any positive set of arguments,     H   n   . Thus, the harmonic mean cannot be made  |arbitrarily_large|Arbitrarily_Large|  by changing some values to bigger ones .       The harmonic mean is one of the three  |Pythagorean_means|Pythagorean_Means| . For all positive data sets containing at least one pair of nonequal values, the harmonic mean is always the least of the three means, Da-Feng Xia, Sen-Lin Xu, and Feng Qi, A proof of the arithmetic mean-geometric mean-harmonic mean inequalities , RGMIA Research Report Collection, vol. 2, no. 1, 1999,  while the  |arithmetic_mean|Arithmetic_Mean|  is always the greatest of the three and the  |geometric_mean|Geometric_Mean|  is always in between.     It is the special case M −1 of the  |power_mean|Power_Mean| Statistical Analysis, Ya-lun Chou, Holt International, 1969,  In the speed example  |below|Examples|  for instance, the arithmetic mean of 40 is incorrect, and too big.     The harmonic mean is related to the other Pythagorean means, as seen in the equation below. This can be seen by interpreting the denominator to be the arithmetic mean of the product of numbers n times but each time omitting the j-th term. That is, for the first term, we multiply all n numbers except the first; for the second, we multiply all n numbers except the second; and so on. The numerator, excluding the n, which goes with the arithmetic mean, is the geometric mean to the power  n. Thus the n-th harmonic mean is related to the n-th geometric and arithmetic means. The general formula is     : H              .       If a set of non-identical numbers is subjected to a  |mean-preserving_spread|Mean-Preserving_Spread|  — that is, two or more elements of the set are spread apart from each other while leaving the arithmetic mean unchanged — then the harmonic mean always decreases.
