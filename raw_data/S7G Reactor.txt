The S7G reactor was a  |prototype|Prototype| |naval_reactor|United_States_Naval_Reactor|  designed for the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy|  to provide  |electricity_generation|Electricity_Generation|  and  |propulsion|Nuclear_Marine_Propulsion|  on  |warships|Warship| . The S7G designation stands for:     S  |Submarine|Submarine|  platform   7 Seventh  |reactor|Nuclear_Reactor_Core|  designed by the contractor   G  |General_Electric|General_Electric|  was the contracted designer     This prototype design was a land-based  |nuclear_reactor|Nuclear_Reactor|  that did not use  |control_rods|Control_Rods| . It was tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Modifications and Additions to a Reactor Facility plant located at the  |Knolls_Atomic_Power_Laboratorys|Knolls_Atomic_Power_Laboratory|  Kesselring Site in  |Ballston_Spa,_New_York|Ballston_Spa,_New_York| . It consisted of an experimental reactor core installed in a modified  |S5W_reactor|S5W_Reactor|  plant.       Instead of the movable  |hafnium|Hafnium| -based  |control_rods|Control_Rod|  used in all of the other United States Naval reactors, reactivity in the S7G core was controlled by stationary  |gadolinium|Gadolinium| -clad tubes partially filled with water. Water could be  |pump|Pump| ed from the portion of the tube inside the core up to a reservoir above the core, or allowed to flow back down into the tube. A higher water level in the tube slowed more  |neutrons|Neutron|  in the core, causing more neutron capture by the gadolinium tube cladding rather than by the  |uranium|Uranium|  fuel, thus lowering the power level.     The system was configured with the pump running continually to keep the water level low; on loss of electrical power, all of the water would flow back into the tube, shutting down the reactor. As with all small  |pressurized_water_reactors|Pressurized_Water_Reactor| , the design also had the advantage of  |negative_feedback|Negative_Feedback| |thermalization|Thermalisation| .
