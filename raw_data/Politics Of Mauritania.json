The Military Council later issued another statement naming as president Col. Mohamed Vall, director of the national police force, the  Sûreté Nationale , since 1987, and listing 16 other officers as members.     Col. Mohamed Vall was once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president SidAhmed Taya, even aiding him in the original coup that brought him to power, and later serving as his security chief. This high-level betrayal of the former president suggests broad discontent within the branches of local government, which is further supported by the lack of bloodshed and the populations support of the rebel militaries.
