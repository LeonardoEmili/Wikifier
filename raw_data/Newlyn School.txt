   The Newlyn School was an  |art_colony|Art_Colony|  of artists based in or near  |Newlyn|Newlyn| , a fishing village adjacent to  |Penzance|Penzance| , on the south coast of  |Cornwall|Cornwall| , from the 1880s until the early twentieth century. The establishment of the Newlyn School was reminiscent of the  |Barbizon_School|Barbizon_School|  in France, where artists fled Paris to paint in a more pure setting emphasizing natural light. These schools along with a related California movement were also known as  |En_plein_air|En_Plein_Air| .     Some of the first British artists to settle in the area had already travelled in Brittany, but found in Newlyn a comparable English environment with a number of things guaranteed to attract them: fantastic light, cheap living, and the availability of inexpensive models. The artists were fascinated by the fishermens working life at sea and the everyday life in the harbour and nearby villages. Some paintings showed the hazards and tragedy of the communitys life, such as women anxiously looking out to sea as the boats go out, or a young woman crying on hearing news of a disaster.  |Walter_Langley|Walter_Langley|  is generally recognised as the pioneer of the Newlyn art colony and  |Stanhope_Forbes|Stanhope_Forbes| , who settled there in 1884, as the father of it. The later Forbes School of Painting, founded by Forbes and his wife  |Elizabeth|Elizabeth_Forbes|  in 1899, promoted the study of figure painting. A present-day  |Newlyn_School_of_Art|Newlyn_School_Of_Art|  was formed in 2011 with Arts Council funding providing art courses taught by many of the best-known artists working in Cornwall today.     In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,  |Lamorna|Lamorna| , a nearby fishing village to the south, became popular with artists of the Newlyn School and is particularly associated with the artist S. J. Lamorna Birch who lived there from 1908.       Newlyn School painters include:     |Lamorna_Birch|Lamorna_Birch| |Frank_Bramley|Frank_Bramley| |Marjorie_Frances_Bruford|Marjorie_Frances_Bruford| |Elizabeth_Forbes|Elizabeth_Forbes| |Stanhope_Forbes|Stanhope_Forbes| |Norman_Garstin|Norman_Garstin| |Caroline_Gotch|Caroline_Gotch| |Thomas_Cooper_Gotch|Thomas_Cooper_Gotch| |Frederick_Hall|Frederick_Hall| |Gertrude_Harvey|Gertrude_Harvey| |Harold_Harvey|Harold_Harvey| |Eleanor_Hughes|Eleanor_Hughes| |Ayerst_Ingram|Ayerst_Ingram| |Harold_Knight|Harold_Knight| |Laura_Knight|Laura_Knight| |Walter_Langley|Walter_Langley| |Carey_Morris|Carey_Morris| |Alfred_Munnings|Alfred_Munnings| |Dod_Procter|Dod_Procter| |Charles_Simpson|Charles_Walter_Simpson| |Ruth_Simpson|Ruth_Simpson| |Albert_Chevallier_Tayler|Albert_Chevallier_Tayler| |Henry_Scott_Tuke|Henry_Scott_Tuke| |Annie_Walke|Annie_Walke|   Fearon      For a full list see: George Bednar.
