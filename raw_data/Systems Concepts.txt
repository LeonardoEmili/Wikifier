Systems Concepts is a company co-founded by  |Stewart_Nelson|Stewart_Nelson|  and  |Mike_Levitt|Mike_Levitt|  focused on making  |hardware|Computer_Hardware|  products related to the  |DEC|Digital_Equipment_Corporation| |PDP-10|Pdp-10|  series of  |computers|Computer| . One of its major products was the SA-10, an interface which allowed PDP-10s to be connected to  |disk|Disk_Storage|  and  |tape|Tape_Drive|  drives designed for use with the channel interfaces of  |IBM_mainframes|Ibm_Mainframe| .     Later, Systems Concepts attempted to produce a compatible replacement for the DEC PDP-10 computers. Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10-compatible computers built by Systems Concepts, including the initial SC-30M, the smaller SC-25, and the slower SC-20. These machines were marvels of engineering design; although not much slower than the unique  |Foonly|Foonly|  F-1, they were physically smaller and consumed less power than the much slower DEC KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4 machines. They were also completely compatible with the DEC KL10, and ran all KL10 binaries  with no modifications at about 2-3 times faster than a KL10.     When DEC cancelled the  |Jupiter_project|Jupiter_Project|  in 1983, Systems Concepts hoped to sell their machine to customers with a software investment in PDP-10s. Their spring 1984 announcement generated excitement in the PDP-10 world.  |TOPS-10|Tops-10|  was running on the Mars by the summer of 1984, and  |TOPS-20|Tops-20|  by early fall. However, people at Systems Concepts were better at designing machines than at mass-producing or selling them; the company continually improved the design, but lost credibility as delivery dates continued to slip. They also overpriced; believing they were competing with the KL10 and  |VAX_8600|Vax_8000|  and not startups such as  |Sun_Microsystems|Sun_Microsystems|  building workstations with comparable power at a fraction of the price. By the time SC shipped the first SC-30M to  |Stanford_University|Stanford_University|  in late 1985, most customers had already abandoned the PDP-10, usually for  |VMS|Openvms|  or  |Unix|Unix|  systems. Nevertheless, a number were purchased by  |CompuServe|Compuserve| , which depended on PDP-10s to run its online service and was eager to move to newer but fully compatible systems. CompuServes demand for the computers outpaced Systems Concepts ability to produce them, so CompuServe licensed the design and built SC-designed computers itself.   Other companies that purchased the SC-30 machines included Telmar, Reynolds and Reynolds,  |The_Danish_National_Railway|Dsb| .      |Peter_Samson|Peter_Samson|  was director of marketing and program development.      SC later designed the SC-40, released in 1993, a faster follow-on to the SC-30M and SC-25. It can perform up to 8 times as fast as a DEC KL-10, and it also supports more  |physical_memory|Random_Access_Memory| , a larger  |virtual_address_space|Virtual_Memory| , and more modern  |input/output|Input/Output|  devices. These systems were also used at CompuServe.     In 1985, the company contracted to engineer and produce a PC-based  |cellular_automata|Cellular_Automaton|  system for  |Tommaso_Toffoli|Tommaso_Toffoli|  of MIT, called the  |CAM-6|Cam-6| . The CAM-6 was a 2-card sandwich that plugged into an  |IBM_PC|Ibm_Personal_Computer|  slot and ran cellular automata rules at a 60 Hz update rate. Toffoli provided  |Forth|Forth| -based software to operate the card. The production problems that plagued the companys computer products were demonstrated here as well, and only a few boards were produced.     Systems Concepts remains in business, having changed its name to the SC Group when it moved from  |California|California|  to  |Nevada|Nevada| .
