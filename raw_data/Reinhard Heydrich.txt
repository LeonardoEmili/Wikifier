                 Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich  was a high-ranking German  |SS|Ss|  and police official during the  |Nazi_era|Nazi_Era|  and a main architect of  |the_Holocaust|The_Holocaust| . He was chief of the  |Reich_Main_Security_Office|Reich_Main_Security_Office|  . He was also Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor of  |Bohemia_and_Moravia|Protectorate_Of_Bohemia_And_Moravia| . He served as president of the International Criminal Police Commission  and chaired the January 1942  |Wannsee_Conference|Wannsee_Conference|  which formalised plans for the  |Final_Solution_to_the_Jewish_Question|Final_Solution_To_The_Jewish_Question|  —the deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe.     Many historians regard Heydrich as the darkest figure within the Nazi regime;  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  described him as the man with the iron heart . He was the founding head of the  Sicherheitsdienst  , an intelligence organisation charged with seeking out and neutralising resistance to the  |Nazi_Party|Nazi_Party|  via arrests, deportations, and murders. He helped organise  Kristallnacht , a series of coordinated attacks against Jews throughout  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  and parts of Austria on 9–10 November 1938. The attacks were carried out by  |SA_stormtroopers|Sturmabteilung|  and civilians and presaged the Holocaust. Upon his arrival in  |Prague|Prague| , Heydrich sought to eliminate opposition to the Nazi occupation by suppressing Czech culture and deporting and executing members of the  |Czech_resistance|Resistance_In_German-Occupied_Czechoslovakia| . He was directly responsible for the  Einsatzgruppen , the special task forces that travelled in the wake of the German armies and murdered more than two million people by mass shooting and gassing, including 1.3  million Jews.     Heydrich was critically wounded in Prague on 27 May 1942 as a result of  |Operation_Anthropoid|Operation_Anthropoid| . He was ambushed by a team of Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been sent by the  |Czechoslovak_government-in-exile|Czechoslovak_Government-In-Exile|  to kill the Reich-Protector; the team was trained by the British  |Special_Operations_Executive|Special_Operations_Executive| . Heydrich died from his injuries a week later. Nazi intelligence falsely linked the Czech/Slovak soldiers and resistance partisans to the villages of  |Lidice|Lidice|  and  |Ležáky|Ležáky| . Both villages were razed; all men and boys over the age of 16 were shot, and all but a handful of the women and children were deported and killed in  |Nazi_concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps| .       Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich was born in 1904 in  |Halle_an_der_Saale|Halle,_Saxony-Anhalt|  to composer and opera singer  |Richard_Bruno_Heydrich|Richard_Bruno_Heydrich|  and his wife, Elisabeth Anna Maria Amalia Heydrich . His father was Protestant and his mother was Roman Catholic. His two forenames were patriotic musical tributes: Reinhard referred to the tragic hero from his fathers opera Amen, and Tristan stems from  |Richard_Wagners|Richard_Wagner|   Tristan und Isolde . Heydrichs third name, Eugen , was his late maternal grandfathers forename .     Heydrichs family held social standing and substantial financial means. Music was a part of Heydrichs everyday life; his father founded the Halle Conservatory of Music, Theatre and Teaching and his mother taught piano there. Heydrich developed a passion for the violin and carried that interest into adulthood; he impressed listeners with his musical talent.     His father was a  |German_nationalist|Pan-Germanism|  who instilled patriotic ideas in his three children, but was not affiliated with any political party until after World War I. The Heydrich household was strict. As a youth, he engaged his younger brother,  |Heinz|Heinz_Heydrich| , in mock  |fencing|Fencing|  duels. He excelled in his schoolwork—especially in science—at the Reformgymnasium . A talented athlete, he became an expert swimmer and fencer. He was shy, insecure, and was frequently bullied for his high-pitched voice and rumoured Jewish ancestry. The latter claim earned him the nickname Moses Handel.      In 1918, World War I ended with Germanys defeat. In late February 1919, civil unrest—including strikes and clashes between communist and anti-communist groups—took place in Heydrichs home town of Halle. Under Defense Minister  |Gustav_Noskes|Gustav_Noske|  directives, a right-wing paramilitary unit was formed and ordered to recapture Halle. Heydrich, then 15 years old, joined Maerckers Volunteer Rifles . When the skirmishes ended, Heydrich was part of the force assigned to protect private property. Little is known about his role, but the events left a strong impression; it was a political awakening for him. He joined the  |Deutschvölkischer_Schutz_und_Trutzbund|Deutschvölkischer_Schutz_Und_Trutzbund|  , an  |anti-Semitic|Anti-Semitic|  organisation.     As a result of the conditions of the  |Treaty_of_Versailles|Treaty_Of_Versailles| ,  |hyperinflation|Hyperinflation_In_The_Weimar_Republic|  spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. Halle was not spared. By 1921, few townspeople there could afford a musical education at Bruno Heydrichs conservatory. This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family.            In 1922, Heydrich joined the German Navy , taking advantage of the security, structure, and pension it offered. He became a naval cadet at  |Kiel|Kiel| , Germanys primary naval base. On 1 April 1924 he was promoted to senior midshipman  and sent to officer training at the  |Naval_Academy_Mürwik|Naval_Academy_Mürwik| . In 1926 he advanced to the rank of ensign  and was assigned as a signals officer on the battleship  SMS Schleswig-Holstein , the flagship of Germanys North Sea Fleet. With the promotion came greater recognition. He received good evaluations from his superiors and had few problems with other crewmen. He was promoted on 1 July 1928 to the rank of sub-lieutenant . The increased rank fuelled his ambition and arrogance.     Heydrich became notorious for his countless affairs. In December 1930 he attended a rowing-club ball and met  |Lina_von_Osten|Lina_Heydrich| . They became romantically involved and soon announced their engagement. Lina was already a Nazi Party follower; she had attended her first rally in 1929. In 1931 Heydrich was charged with conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman for breaking an engagement promise to a woman he had known for six months before the von Osten engagement. Admiral  |Erich_Raeder|Erich_Raeder|  dismissed Heydrich from the navy that April. He received severance pay of 200 Reichsmarks  a month for the next two years. Heydrich married Lina in December 1931.       On 30 May 1931, Heydrichs discharge from the navy became legally binding, and either the following day or on 1 June he joined the Nazi Party in Hamburg. Six weeks later, on 14 July, he joined the SS. His Party number was 544,916 and his SS number was 10,120. Those who joined the Party after Hitlers  |seizure_of_power|Machtergreifung|  in January 1933 faced suspicions from the  Alte Kämpfer  that they had joined for reasons of career advancement rather than a true commitment to the National Socialist program. Heydrichs date of enlistment in 1931 was early enough to quell suspicion that he had only joined to further his career, but was not early enough for him to be considered an Old Fighter.     In 1931,  |Heinrich_Himmler|Heinrich_Himmler|  began setting up a  |counterintelligence|Counterintelligence|  division of the SS. Acting on the advice of his associate  |Karl_von_Eberstein|Karl_Von_Eberstein| , who was Linas friend, Himmler agreed to interview Heydrich, but cancelled their appointment at the last minute. Lina ignored this message, packed Heydrichs suitcase, and sent him to Munich. Eberstein met Heydrich at the railway station and took him to see Himmler. Himmler asked Heydrich to convey his ideas for developing an SS intelligence service. Himmler was so impressed that he hired Heydrich immediately.     Although the starting monthly salary of 180 Reichsmarks  was low, Heydrich decided to take the job because Linas family supported the Nazi movement, and the quasi-military and revolutionary nature of the post appealed to him. At first he had to share an office and typewriter with a colleague, but by 1932 Heydrich was earning 290 Reichsmarks a month , a salary he described as comfortable . As his power and influence grew throughout the 1930s, his wealth grew commensurately; in 1935 he received a base salary of 8,400 Reichsmarks  and an allowance of 12,000 Reichsmarks  and by 1938 his income increased to 17,371 Reichsmarks , annually. Heydrich later received a  |Totenkopfring|Totenkopfring|  from Himmler for his SS service.     On 1 August 1931, Heydrich began his job as chief of the new Ic Service . He set up office at the  |Brown_House|Brown_House,_Munich,_Germany| , the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich. By October he had created a network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering purposes and to obtain information to be used as  |blackmail|Blackmail|  to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House. To mark the occasion of Heydrichs December wedding, Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS- Sturmbannführer  .     In 1932, rumours were spread by Heydrichs enemies of his alleged Jewish ancestry.  |Wilhelm_Canaris|Wilhelm_Canaris|  said he had obtained photocopies proving Heydrichs Jewish ancestry, but these photocopies never surfaced. Nazi  |Gauleiter|Gauleiter| |Rudolf_Jordan|Rudolf_Jordan|  claimed Heydrich was not a pure Aryan. Within the Nazi organisation such innuendo could be damning, even for the head of the Reichs counterintelligence service.  |Gregor_Strasser|Gregor_Strasser|  passed the allegations on to the Nazi Partys racial expert,  |Achim_Gercke|Achim_Gercke| , who investigated Heydrichs genealogy. Gercke reported that Heydrich was ...  of German origin and free from any coloured and Jewish blood . He insisted that the rumours were baseless. Even so, Heydrich privately engaged SD member Ernst Hoffmann to further investigate and dispel the rumours.            In mid-1932, Himmler appointed Heydrich chief of the renamed security service—the  Sicherheitsdienst  . Heydrichs counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror and intimidation. With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states. They began with  |Bavaria|Bavaria| . In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using intimidation tactics. Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the  |political_police|Bavarian_Political_Police| .     In 1933, Hitler became  |Chancellor_of_Germany|Chancellor_Of_Germany| , and through a series of decrees became Germanys  Führer und Reichskanzler  . The first  |concentration_camps|Nazi_Concentration_Camps| , which were originally intended to house political opponents, were established in early 1933. By years end there were over fifty camps.      |Hermann_Göring|Hermann_Göring|  founded the  |Gestapo|Gestapo|  in 1933 as a  |Prussia|Prussia| n police force. When Göring transferred full authority over the Gestapo to Himmler in April 1934, it immediately became an instrument of terror under the SSs purview. Himmler named Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. On 9 June 1934,  |Rudolf_Hess|Rudolf_Hess|  declared the SD the official Nazi intelligence service.            Beginning in April 1934, and at Hitlers request, Heydrich and Himmler began building a dossier on  Sturmabteilung  leader  |Ernst_Röhm|Ernst_Röhm|  in an effort to remove him as a rival for party leadership. At this point, the SS was still part of the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary organisation which now numbered over 3 million men. At Hitlers direction, Heydrich, Himmler, Göring, and  |Viktor_Lutze|Viktor_Lutze|  drew up lists of those who should be killed, starting with seven top SA officials and including many more. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. Röhm was shot without trial, along with the leadership of the SA. The purge became known as the  |Night_of_the_Long_Knives|Night_Of_The_Long_Knives| . Up to 200 people were killed in the action. Lutze was appointed SAs new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation.        With the SA out of the way, Heydrich began building the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo had the authority to arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of  Schutzhaft — protective custody , a  |euphemism|Euphemism|  for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally as long as it was carrying out the leaderships will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.     Himmler began developing the notion of a  |Germanic_religion|Religious_Aspects_Of_Nazismhimmler_And_The_Ss|  and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member, but came to consider the churchs political power and influence a danger to the state.       On 17 June 1936, all police forces throughout Germany were united, following Hitlers appointment of Himmler as Chief of German Police. With this appointment by the Führer, Himmler and his deputy, Heydrich, became two of the most powerful men in the internal administration of Germany. Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups: the  Ordnungspolizei  , consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the  Sicherheitspolizei  , consisting of the Geheime StaatsPolizei and Kriminalpolizei . At that point, Heydrich was head of the SiPo and SD.  |Heinrich_Müller|Heinrich_Müller|  was the Gestapos operations chief.     Heydrich was assigned to help organise the  |1936_Summer_Olympics|1936_Summer_Olympics|  in Berlin. The games were used to promote the  |propaganda_aims|Nazi_Propaganda|  of the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of  Der Stürmer . For his part in the games success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German  |Olympic_Games_Decoration|Olympic_Games_Decoration|  .        In January 1937, Heydrich directed the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing public opinion and report back its findings. He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches, arrests, and interrogations, thus in effect exercising control over public opinion. In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor  |Kurt_Schuschnigg|Kurt_Schuschnigg|  resisted Hitlers proposed merger with Germany, Heydrich intensified the pressure on Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna emphasizing the common Germanic blood of the two countries. In the  Anschluss  on 12 March, Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany.     In mid-1939, Heydrich created the  |Stiftung_Nordhav|Stiftung_Nordhav|  Foundation to obtain real estate for the SS and Security Police to use as guest houses and vacation spots. The Wannsee Villa, which the Stiftung Nordhav acquired in November 1940, was the site of the  |Wannsee_Conference|Wannsee_Conference|  . Heydrich was the lead speaker, with support from  |Adolf_Eichmann|Adolf_Eichmann| . At Wannsee, senior Nazi officials formalised plans to deport and exterminate all Jews in German-occupied territory and those countries not yet conquered. This action was to be coordinated among the representatives from the Nazi state agencies present at the meeting.     On 27 September 1939, the SD and SiPo were folded into the new  |Reich_Main_Security_Office|Reich_Main_Security_Office|  or Reichssicherheitshauptamt , which was placed under Heydrichs control. The title of Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD or CSSD was conferred on Heydrich on 1 October. Heydrich became the president of the ICPC  on 24 August 1940, and its headquarters were transferred to Berlin. He was promoted to SS- Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei on 24 September 1941.       In 1936, Heydrich learned that a top-ranking Soviet officer was plotting to overthrow  |Joseph_Stalin|Joseph_Stalin| . Sensing an opportunity to strike a blow at both the Soviet Army and  |Admiral_Canaris|Admiral_Canaris|  of Germanys  |Abwehr|Abwehr| , Heydrich decided that the Soviet officer should be unmasked . He discussed the matter with Himmler and both in turn brought it to Hitlers attention. Hitler approved Heydrichs plan to act immediately. But the information Heydrich had received was actually misinformation planted by Stalin himself in an attempt to legitimise his planned purges of the  |Red_Armys|Red_Army|  high command. Stalin ordered one of his best  |NKVD|Nkvd|  agents, General  |Nikolai_Skoblin|Nikolai_Skoblin| , to pass Heydrich false information suggesting that Marshal  |Mikhail_Tukhachevsky|Mikhail_Tukhachevsky|  and other Soviet generals were plotting against Stalin.     Heydrichs SD forged documents and letters implicating Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders. The material was delivered to the NKVD. The  |Great_Purge|Great_Purge|  of the Red Army followed on Stalins orders. While Heydrich believed they had successfully deluded Stalin into executing or dismissing 35,000 of his officer corps, the importance of Heydrichs part is a matter of conjecture. Soviet military prosecutors did not use SD forged documents against the generals in their secret trial; they instead relied on false confessions extorted or beaten out of the defendants.              By late 1940, German armies had invaded most of Western Europe. The following year, Heydrichs SD was given responsibility for carrying out the  Nacht und Nebel  decree. According to the decree, persons endangering German security were to be arrested in a maximally discreet way: under the cover of night and fog . People disappeared without a trace with none told of their whereabouts or fate. For each prisoner, the SD had to fill in a questionnaire that listed personal information, country of origin, and the details of their crimes against the Reich. This questionnaire was placed in an envelope inscribed with a seal reading Nacht und Nebel and submitted to the Reich Main Security Office . In the  |WVHA|Ss-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt|  Central Inmate File , as in many camp files, these prisoners would be given a special covert prisoner code, as opposed to the code for POW, Felon, Jew, Gypsy, etc. The decree remained in effect after Heydrichs death. The exact number of people who vanished under it has never been positively established, but it is estimated to be 7,000.       Heydrich created the Zentralstelle IIP Polen unit of the Gestapo in order to coordinate the  |ethnic_cleansing_of_Poles|Nazi_Crimes_Against_The_Polish_Nation|  in  |Operation_Tannenberg|Operation_Tannenberg|  and the  Intelligenzaktion ,  two codenames for extermination actions directed at the  |Polish_people|Polish_People|  during the German occupation of Poland.   Among the 100,000 people murdered in the Intelligenzaktion operations in 1939–1940, approximately 61,000 were members of the Polish intelligentsia: scholars, clergy, former officers, and others, whom the Germans identified as political targets in the  Special Prosecution Book-Poland , compiled before the war began in September 1939. Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski,  Polish American Congress, Washington.             On 27 September 1941, Heydrich was appointed Deputy Reich Protector of the  |Protectorate_of_Bohemia_and_Moravia|Protectorate_Of_Bohemia_And_Moravia|   and assumed control of the territory. The Reich Protector,  |Konstantin_von_Neurath|Konstantin_Von_Neurath| , remained the territorys titular head, but was sent on leave because Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich felt his soft approach to the  |Czechs|Czechs|  had promoted anti-German sentiment and encouraged anti-German resistance via strikes and sabotage. Upon his appointment, Heydrich told his aides: We will Germanize the Czech vermin.      Heydrich came to  |Prague|Prague|  to enforce policy, fight resistance to the Nazi regime, and keep up production quotas of Czech motors and arms that were extremely important to the German war effort . He viewed the area as a bulwark of Germandom and condemned the Czech resistances stabs in the back . To realise his goals, Heydrich demanded racial classification of those who could and could not be  |Germanized|Germanisation| . He explained, Making this Czech garbage into Germans must give way to methods based on racist thought.      Heydrich started his rule by terrorising the population: he proclaimed  |martial_law|Martial_Law| , and 142 people were executed within five days of his arrival in Prague.  Their names appeared on posters throughout the occupied country. Most of them were the members of the resistance that had previously been captured and were awaiting trial.     According to Heydrichs estimate, between 4,000 and 5,000 people were arrested and between 400 and 500 were executed by February 1942.  Those who were not executed were sent to  |Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp|Mauthausen-Gusen_Concentration_Camp| , where only four per cent of Czech prisoners survived the war. Czech  |Prime_Minister_Eliáš|Alois_Eliáš|  was among those arrested the first day. He was  |put_on_trial|Peoples_Court|  in Berlin and sentenced to death, but was kept alive as a hostage. He was later executed in retaliation for Heydrichs assassination.        In March 1942, further sweeps against Czech cultural and patriotic organisations, the military, and the intelligentsia resulted in the practical paralysis of the London-based Czech resistance. Almost all avenues by which Czechs could express the Czech culture in public were closed. Although small disorganised cells of  |Central_Leadership_of_Home_Resistance|Resistance_In_German-Occupied_Czechoslovakiaconsolidation_Of_Resistance_Groups:_Úvod|  survived, only the communist resistance was able to function in a coordinated manner . The terror also served to paralyse resistance in society, with public and widespread reprisals by the Nazis against any action resisting German rule. Heydrichs brutal policies during that time quickly earned him the nickname the Butcher of Prague . The reprisals are referred to by Czechs as the Heydrichiáda .     As Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Heydrich applied  |carrot-and-stick|Carrot-And-Stick|  methods. Labour was reorganised on the basis of the  |German_Labour_Front|German_Labour_Front| . Heydrich used equipment confiscated from the Czech organisation  |Sokol|Sokol|  to organise events for workers. Food rations and free shoes were distributed, pensions were increased, and free Saturdays were introduced.  |Unemployment_insurance|Unemployment_Insurance|  was established for the first time. The  |black_market|Black_Market|  was suppressed. Those associated with it or the resistance movement were tortured or executed. Heydrich labelled them economic criminals and enemies of the people , which helped gain him support. Conditions in Prague and the rest of the Czech lands were relatively peaceful under Heydrich, and industrial output increased. Still, those measures could not hide shortages and increasing inflation; reports of growing discontent multiplied.          Despite public displays of goodwill towards the populace, privately Heydrich was very clear about his eventual goal: This entire area will one day be definitely German, and the Czechs have nothing to expect here. Eventually up to two-thirds of the populace were to be either  |removed_to_regions_of_Russia|Generalplan_Ost|  or exterminated after Nazi Germany won the war. Bohemia and Moravia faced annexation directly into the German Reich.     The Czech workforce was exploited as Nazi-conscripted labour. More than 100,000 workers were removed from unsuitable jobs and conscripted by the Ministry of Labour. By December 1941, Czechs could be called to work anywhere within the Reich. Between April and November 1942, 79,000 Czech workers were taken in this manner for work within Nazi Germany. Also, in February 1942, the work day was increased from eight to twelve hours.     Heydrich was, for all intents and purposes, military dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His changes to the governments structure left President  |Emil_Hacha|Emil_Hacha|  and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone in a car with an open roof – a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his governments effectiveness.     By 3 October 1941, Czechoslovak  |military_intelligence|Military_Intelligence|  in London had made the decision to kill Heydrich.              Historians regard Heydrich as the most fearsome member of the Nazi elite. Hitler called him the man with the iron heart . He was one of the main architects of the  |Holocaust|Holocaust|  during the early war years, answering to and taking orders from only Hitler, Göring, and Himmler in all matters pertaining to the deportation, imprisonment, and extermination of Jews.     Heydrich was one of the organisers of  Kristallnacht , a  |pogrom|Pogrom|  against Jews throughout Germany on the night of 9–10 November 1938. Heydrich sent a telegram that night to various SD and Gestapo offices, helping to coordinate the pogrom with the SS, SD, Gestapo, uniformed police , SA, Nazi party officials, and even the fire departments. In the telegram, Heydrich granted permission for arson and destruction of Jewish businesses and synagogues, and ordered the confiscation of all archival material from Jewish community centres and synagogues. The telegram ordered that as many Jews  – particularly affluent Jews  – are to be arrested in all districts as can be accommodated in existing detention facilities  ... Immediately after the arrests have been carried out, the appropriate concentration camps should be contacted to place the Jews into camps as quickly as possible.  Twenty thousand Jews were sent to concentration camps in the days immediately following; historians consider Kristallnacht the beginning of the Holocaust.     When Hitler asked for a  |pretext|Casus_Belli|  for the  |invasion_of_Poland|Invasion_Of_Poland|  in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich Müller masterminded a  |false_flag|False_Flag|  plan code-named  |Operation_Himmler|Operation_Himmler| . It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at  |Gleiwitz|Gliwice|  on 31 August 1939. Heydrich masterminded the plan and toured the site, which was about four miles from the Polish border. Wearing Polish uniforms, 150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border. Hitler used the ruse as an excuse to launch his invasion.        On Himmlers instructions, Heydrich formed the  Einsatzgruppen  to travel in the wake of the German armies at the start of World War II. On 21 September 1939, Heydrich sent out a teleprinter message on the Jewish question in the occupied territory to the chiefs of all Einsatzgruppen with instructions to round up Jewish people for placement into ghettos, called for the formation of  |Judenräte|Judenrat|  , ordered a census, and promoted  |Aryanization|Aryanization|  plans for Jewish-owned businesses and farms, among other measures. The Einsatzgruppen units followed the army into Poland to implement the plans. Later, in the Soviet Union, they were charged with rounding up and killing Jews via firing squad and gas vans. Historian  |Raul_Hilberg|Raul_Hilberg|  estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related auxiliary troops killed more than two million people, including 1.3  million Jews. Heydrich ensured the safety of certain athletes, such as Paul Sommer, a Jewish German champion fencer he knew from his pre-SS days, and the Polish Olympic fencing team that competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics.             On 29 November 1939, Heydrich issued a cable about the Evacuation of New Eastern Provinces , detailing the deportation of people by railway to concentration camps, and giving guidance surrounding the December 1939 census, which would be the basis on which those deportations were performed. In May 1941 Heydrich drew up regulations with  |Quartermaster_general|Quartermaster_General| |Eduard_Wagner|Eduard_Wagner|  for the upcoming  |invasion_of_the_Soviet_Union|Operation_Barbarossa| , which ensured that the Einsatzgruppen and army would co-operate in murdering Soviet Jews.     On 10 October 1941, Heydrich was the senior officer at a Final Solution meeting of the RSHA in Prague that discussed deporting 50,000 Jews from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to ghettos in  |Minsk|Minsk_Ghetto|  and  |Riga|Riga_Ghetto| . Given his position, Heydrich was instrumental in carrying out these plans since his Gestapo was ready to organise deportations in the West and his Einsatzgruppen were already conducting extensive killing operations in the East. The officers attending also discussed taking 5,000 Jews from Prague in the next few weeks and handing them over to the Einsatzgruppen commanders  |Arthur_Nebe|Arthur_Nebe|  and  |Otto_Rasch|Otto_Rasch| . Establishing ghettos in the Protectorate was also planned, resulting in the construction of  |Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt| , where 33,000 people would eventually die. Tens of thousands more passed through the camp on their way to their deaths in the East. In 1941 Himmler named Heydrich as responsible for implementing the forced movement of 60,000 Jews from Germany and Czechoslovakia to the  |Lodz_Ghetto|Ghetto_Litzmannstadt|  in Poland.     Earlier on 31 July 1941, Hermann Göring gave written authorisation to Heydrich to ensure the co-operation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of a  |Final_Solution|Final_Solution|  to the  |Jewish_Question|Jewish_Question|  in territories under German control.  On 20 January 1942, Heydrich chaired a meeting, now called the  |Wannsee_Conference|Wannsee_Conference| , to discuss the implementation of the plan.                    In London, the  |Czechoslovak_government-in-exile|Czechoslovak_Government-In-Exile|  resolved to kill Heydrich.  |Jan_Kubiš|Jan_Kubiš|  and  |Jozef_Gabčík|Jozef_Gabčík|  headed the team chosen for the operation, trained by the British  |Special_Operations_Executive|Special_Operations_Executive|  . They returned to the Protectorate, parachuting from a  |Handley_Page_Halifax|Handley_Page_Halifax|  on 28 December 1941, where they lived in hiding, preparing for the mission.     On 27 May 1942, Heydrich planned to meet Hitler in Berlin. German documents suggest that Hitler intended to transfer him to German-occupied France where the  |French_resistance|French_Resistance|  was gaining ground. Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction in the Prague suburb of  |Libeň|Libeň|  was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrichs car slowed, Gabčík took aim with a  |Sten|Sten|  submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Heydrich ordered his driver Klein to halt and attempted to confront the attackers, rather than having his driver speed away. Kubiš then threw a converted anti-tank mine at the rear of the car as it stopped. The explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš. Heydrich ordered Klein to chase Gabčík on foot, and Gabčík shot Klein in the leg. Kubiš and Gabčík managed to escape the scene.     A Czech woman went to Heydrichs aid and flagged down a delivery van. He was placed in the back of the van on his stomach and taken to the emergency room at  |Bulovka_Hospital|Bulovka_Hospital| . He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one lung. A  |splenectomy|Splenectomy|  was performed, and the chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all  |debrided|Debridement| . Himmler ordered  |Karl_Gebhardt|Karl_Gebhardt|  to fly to Prague to assume care. Despite a fever, Heydrichs recovery appeared to progress well. Hitlers personal doctor  |Theodor_Morell|Theodor_Morell|  suggested the use of the new antibacterial drug  |sulfonamide|Sulfonamide| , but Gebhardt thought that Heydrich would recover and declined the suggestion. Heydrich reconciled himself to his fate on 2 June, during a visit by Himmler, by reciting one of his fathers operas:   Heydrich slipped into a coma after Himmlers visit and never regained consciousness. He died on 4 June; an autopsy concluded that he died of  |sepsis|Sepsis| .       After an elaborate funeral held in Prague on 7 June 1942, Heydrichs coffin was placed on a train to Berlin, where a second ceremony was held in the new  |Reich_Chancellery|Reich_Chancellery|  on 9 June. Himmler gave the eulogy. Hitler attended and placed Heydrichs decorations—including the highest grade of the  |German_Order|German_Order| , the  |Blood_Order|Blood_Order|  Medal, the  |Wound_Badge|Wound_Badge|  in Gold, and the  |War_Merit_Cross|War_Merit_Cross|  1st Class with Swords—on his funeral pillow. Although Heydrichs death was employed for pro-Reich propaganda, Hitler privately blamed Heydrich for his own death, through carelessness:               Heydrich was interred in Berlins  |Invalidenfriedhof|Invalidenfriedhof| , a military cemetery. The exact burial spot is not known—a temporary wooden marker that disappeared when the Red Army overran the city in 1945 was never replaced, so that Heydrichs grave could not become a rallying point for  |Neo-Nazis|Neo-Nazism| . A photograph of Heydrichs burial shows the wreaths and mourners to be in section A, which abuts the north wall of the Invalidenfriedhof and Scharnhorststraße, at the front of the cemetery. A recent biography of Heydrich also places the grave in Section A. Hitler planned for Heydrich to have a monumental tomb  but, due to Germanys declining fortunes, it was never built.     Heydrichs widow Lina won the right to a pension following a series of court cases against the  |West_German|West_German|  government in 1956 and 1959. She was declared entitled to a substantial pension as her husband was a German general killed in action. The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrichs role in the Holocaust. The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her fathers death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher , which was published in 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.                 Heydrichs assailants hid in safe houses and eventually took refuge in  |Ss._Cyril_and_Methodius_Cathedral|Ss._Cyril_And_Methodius_Cathedral| , an Orthodox church in Prague. After a traitor in the Czech resistance betrayed their location, the church was surrounded by 800 members of the SS and Gestapo. Several Czechs were killed, and the remainder hid in the churchs crypt. The Germans attempted to flush the men out with gunfire, tear gas, and by flooding the crypt. Eventually an entrance was made using explosives. Rather than surrender, the soldiers killed themselves. Supporters of the assassins who were killed in the wake of these events included the churchs leader,  |Bishop_Gorazd|Gorazd| , who is now revered as a martyr of the Orthodox Church.          Infuriated by Heydrichs death, Hitler ordered the arrest and execution of 10,000 randomly selected Czechs. But after consultations with  |Karl_Hermann_Frank|Karl_Hermann_Frank| , he altered his response. The Czech lands were an important industrial zone for the German military, and indiscriminate killing could reduce the regions productivity. Hitler ordered a quick investigation. Intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the towns of  |Lidice|Lidice|  and  |Ležáky|Ležáky| . A Gestapo report stated that Lidice,  north-west of Prague, was suspected as the assailants hiding place because several Czech army officers, then in England, had come from there and the Gestapo found a resistance radio transmitter in Ležáky. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered  |brutal_reprisals|Lidice_Massacre| . Beginning on 10 June, all males over the age of 16 in the villages of Lidice and Ležáky were murdered. All the women in Ležáky were also murdered.     All but four of the women from Lidice were deported immediately to  |Ravensbrück|Ravensbrück|  concentration camp . Some children were chosen for  |Germanization|Germanization| , and 81 were killed in  |gas_vans|Nazi_Gas_Van|  at the  |Chełmno_extermination_camp|Chełmno_Extermination_Camp| . Both towns were burned and Lidices ruins were levelled. Overall, at least 1,300  Czechs, including 200 women, were killed in reprisal for Heydrichs assassination.     Heydrichs replacements were  |Ernst_Kaltenbrunner|Ernst_Kaltenbrunner|  as the chief of  |RSHA|Rsha| , and  |Karl_Hermann_Frank|Karl_Hermann_Frank|  and  |Kurt_Daluege|Kurt_Daluege|  as the new acting  |Reichsprotektors|Reichsprotektor| . After Heydrichs death, implementation of the policies formalised at the Wannsee conference he chaired was accelerated. The first three true  |death_camps|Death_Camps| , designed for mass killing with no  |legal_process|Legal_Process|  or pretext, were built and operated at  |Treblinka|Treblinka_Extermination_Camp| ,  |Sobibór|Sobibor_Extermination_Camp| , and  |Bełżec|Belzec_Extermination_Camp| . The project was named  |Operation_Reinhard|Operation_Reinhard|  after Heydrich.       Heydrichs time in the SS was a mixture of rapid promotions, reserve commissions in the regular armed forces, and front-line combat service. During his 11 years with the SS Heydrich rose from the ranks and was appointed to every rank from private to full general. He was also a  |major|Major|  in the  |Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe| , flying nearly 100 combat missions until 22 July 1941, when his plane was hit by Soviet anti-aircraft fire. Heydrich made an emergency landing behind enemy lines. He evaded a Soviet patrol and contacted a forward German patrol. After this Hitler personally ordered Heydrich to return to Berlin to resume his SS duties. His service record also gives him credit as a Navy Reserve Lieutenant, but in 1931 he was dismissed for conduct unbecoming an officer with  |loss_of_rank|Reduction_In_Rank| , and during World War II he had no contact with the Navy Reserve.      Heydrich received a number of Nazi and military awards. These included the  |German_Order|German_Order| ,  |Blood_Order|Blood_Order| ,  |Golden_Party_Badge|Golden_Party_Badge| ,  |Luftwaffe_Pilots_Badge|Aviator_Badgegermany| , bronze and silver  |Front_Flying_Clasp_of_the_Luftwaffe|Front_Flying_Clasp_Of_The_Luftwaffe|  for combat missions, and the  |Iron_Cross|Iron_Cross|  First and Second Classes.
