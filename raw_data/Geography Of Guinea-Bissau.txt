The country borders  |Senegal|Senegal|  in the north and  |Guinea|Guinea|  in the southeast.       	     The terrain of Guinea-Bissau is mostly low coastal plain with swamps of  |Guinean_mangroves|Guinean_Mangroves|  rising to  |Guinean_forest-savanna_mosaic|Guinean_Forest-Savanna_Mosaic|  in the east.     The lowest point on Guinea-Bissau is at sea level at the Atlantic Ocean. The highest point on Guinea-Bissau is 300 metres above sea level at an unnamed location in the eastern part of the country.

Natural hazards include a hot, dry, dusty  |harmattan|Harmattan|  haze that may reduce visibility during the dry season and brush fires. Severe environmental issues include  |deforestation|Deforestation| ;  |soil_erosion|Soil_Erosion| ;  |overgrazing|Overgrazing|  and  |overfishing|Overfishing| .
