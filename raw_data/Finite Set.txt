In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a finite set is a  |set|Set|  that has a  |finite|Wikt:Finite|  number of  |elements|Element| . Informally, a finite set is a set which one could in principle count and finish counting. For example,   :     is a finite set with five elements. The number of elements of a finite set is a  |natural_number|Natural_Number|   and is called the  |cardinality|Cardinality|  of the set. A set that is not finite is called  infinite . For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite:   :     Finite sets are particularly important in  |combinatorics|Combinatorics| , the mathematical study of  |counting|Counting| . Many arguments involving finite sets rely on the  |pigeonhole_principle|Pigeonhole_Principle| , which states that there cannot exist an  |injective_function|Injective_Function|  from a larger finite set to a smaller finite set.         Formally, a set  is called finite if there exists a  |bijection|Bijection|    : f  S    for some natural number . The number  is the sets cardinality, denoted as    |empty_set|Empty_Set|  or Ø is considered finite, with cardinality zero.         If a set is finite, its elements may be written — in many ways — in a  |sequence|Sequence| |combinatorics|Combinatorics| , a finite set with  elements is sometimes called an -set and a subset with  elements is called a -subset. For example, the set is a 3-set  – a finite set with three elements  – and is a 2-subset of it.              Any proper  |subset|Subset|  of a finite set S is finite and has fewer elements than S itself. As a consequence, there cannot exist a  |bijection|Bijection|  between a finite set S and a proper subset of S. Any set with this property is called  |Dedekind-finite|Dedekind-Finite| . Using the standard  |ZFC|Zermelo–Fraenkel_Set_Theory|  axioms for  |set_theory|Set_Theory| , every Dedekind-finite set is also finite, but this implication cannot be proved in ZF  alone.   The  |axiom_of_countable_choice|Axiom_Of_Countable_Choice| , a weak version of the axiom of choice, is sufficient to prove this equivalence.     Any injective function between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also a  |surjective_function|Surjective_Function|  . Similarly, any surjection between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also an injection.     The  |union|Union|  of two finite sets is finite, with   :  S  T     S  +  T .   In fact:   :  S  T   S  +  T  -  S  T .   More generally, the  |union|Union|  of any finite number of finite sets is finite. The  |Cartesian_product|Cartesian_Product|  of finite sets is also finite, with:   :  S  T   S     Similarly, the Cartesian product of finitely many finite sets is finite. A finite set with n elements has 2 distinct subsets. That is, the    |power_set|Power_Set|  of a finite set is finite, with cardinality 2.     Any subset of a finite set is finite. The set of values of a function when applied to elements of a finite set is finite.     All finite sets are  |countable|Countable| , but not all countable sets are finite.     The  |free_semilattice|Free_Semilattice|  over a finite set is the set of its non-empty subsets, with the  |join_operation|Join_And_Meet|  being given by set union.         In  |Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel_Set_Theory|  without the axiom of choice , the following conditions are all equivalent:     S is a finite set. That is, S can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of those natural numbers less than some specific natural number.    S has all properties which can be proved by mathematical induction beginning with the empty set and adding one new element at a time.     S can be given a total ordering which is  |well-order|Well-Order| ed both forwards and backwards. That is, every non-empty subset of S has both a least and a greatest element in the subset.   Every one-to-one function from P into itself is  |onto|Onto| . That is, the  |powerset|Powerset|  of the powerset of S is Dedekind-finite . The equivalence of the standard numerical definition of finite sets to the Dedekind-finiteness of the power set of the power set was shown in 1912 by . This Whitehead/Russell theorem is described in more modern language by .   Every surjective function from P onto itself is one-to-one.    Every non-empty family of subsets of S has a  |minimal_element|Minimal_Element|  with respect to inclusion. , demonstrated that his definition is equivalent to Kuratowskis set-theoretical definition, which he then noted is equivalent to the standard numerical definition via the proof by .    S can be well-ordered and any two well-orderings on it are  |order_isomorphic|Order_Isomorphic| . In other words, the well-orderings on S have exactly one  |order_type|Order_Type| .     If the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice|  is also assumed .
