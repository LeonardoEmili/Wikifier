      The Sierpinski triangle , also called the Sierpinski gasket or Sierpinski sieve, is a  |fractal|Fractal|  and  |attractive_fixed_set|Attractive_Fixed_Set|  with the overall shape of an  |equilateral_triangle|Equilateral_Triangle| , subdivided  |recursively|Recursion|  into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of  |self_similar|Self_Similarity|  sets–that is, it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the  |Polish|Poland| |_mathematician|Mathematician| |_Wacław_Sierpiński|Wacław_Sierpiński| , but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpiński.       There are many different ways of constructing the Sierpinski triangle.          The Sierpinski triangle may be constructed from an  |equilateral_triangle|Equilateral_Triangle|  by repeated removal of triangular subsets:   Start with an equilateral triangle.   Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove the central triangle.   Repeat step 2 with each of the remaining smaller triangles infinitely.     Each removed triangle  is  |topologically|Topology|  an  |open_set|Open_Set| .    This process of recursively removing triangles is an example of a  |finite_subdivision_rule|Finite_Subdivision_Rule| .          The same sequence of shapes, converging to the Sierpinski triangle, can alternatively be generated by the following steps:   Start with any triangle in a plane . The canonical Sierpinski triangle uses an  |equilateral_triangle|Equilateral_Triangle|  with a base parallel to the horizontal axis .   Shrink the triangle to  height and  width, make three copies, and position the three shrunken triangles so that each triangle touches the two other triangles at a corner . Note the emergence of the central hole—because the three shrunken triangles can between them cover only  of the area of the original.   Repeat step 2 with each of the smaller triangles .     Note that this infinite process is not dependent upon the starting shape being a triangle—it is just clearer that way. The first few steps starting, for example, from a square also tend towards a Sierpinski triangle.  |Michael_Barnsley|Michael_Barnsley|  used an image of a fish to illustrate this in his paper V-variable fractals and superfractals.  NOVA . The Strange New Science of Chaos . Public television station WGBH Boston. Aired 31 January 1989.        The actual fractal is what would be obtained after an infinite number of iterations. More formally, one describes it in terms of functions on closed sets of points. If we let d A denote the dilation by a factor of  about a point A, then the Sierpinski triangle with corners A, B, and C is the fixed set of the transformation d A  ∪  d B  ∪  d C .     This is an  |attractive_fixed_set|Attractive_Fixed_Set| , so that when the operation is applied to any other set repeatedly, the images converge on the Sierpinski triangle. This is what is happening with the triangle above, but any other set would suffice.          If one takes a point and applies each of the transformations d A , d B , and d C to it randomly, the resulting points will be dense in the Sierpinski triangle, so the following algorithm will again generate arbitrarily close approximations to it: .     Start by labeling p 1 , p 2 and p 3 as the corners of the Sierpinski triangle, and a random point v 1 . Set , where r n  is a random number 1, 2 or 3. Draw the points v 1 to v ∞ . If the first point v 1 was a point on the Sierpiński triangle, then all the points v n lie on the Sierpinski triangle. If the first point v 1 to lie within the perimeter of the triangle is not a point on the Sierpinski triangle, none of the points v n will lie on the Sierpinski triangle, however they will converge on the triangle. If v 1 is outside the triangle, the only way v n will land on the actual triangle, is if v n is on what would be part of the triangle, if the triangle was infinitely large.                Or more simply:   Take three points in a plane to form a triangle, you need not draw it.   Randomly select any point inside the triangle and consider that your current position.   Randomly select any one of the three vertex points.   Move half the distance from your current position to the selected vertex.   Plot the current position.   Repeat from step 3.     This method is also called the  |chaos_game|Chaos_Game| , and is an example of an  |iterated_function_system|Iterated_Function_System| . You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpinski Gasket with a few leftover points . With pencil and paper, a brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred. An interactive version of the chaos game can be found                Another construction for the Sierpinski gasket shows that it can be constructed as a  |curve|Curve|  in the plane. It is formed by a process of repeated modification of simpler curves, analogous to the construction of the  |Koch_snowflake|Koch_Snowflake| |Sierpinski_arrowhead|Sierpinski_Arrowhead_Curve| . . In fact, the aim of the original article by Sierpinski of 1915, was to show an example of a curve , as the title of the article itself declares.         The Sierpinski triangle also appears in certain  |cellular_automata|Cellular_Automata|  , including those relating to  |Conways_Game_of_Life|Conways_Game_Of_Life| . For instance, the  |Life_like_cellular_automaton|Life_Like_Cellular_Automaton|  B1/S12 when applied to a single cell will generate four approximations of the Sierpinski triangle. . A very long one cell thick line in standard life will create two mirrored Sierpinski triangles. The time-space diagram of a replicator pattern in a cellular automaton also often resembles a Sierpinski triangle, such as that of the common replicator in HighLife. . The Sierpinski triangle can also be found in the  |Ulam_Warburton_automaton|Ulam_Warburton_Automaton|  and the Hex-Ulam-Warburton automaton.

Math Horizons, 23, 5–9 ,  |arXiv|Arxiv|           If one takes  |Pascals_triangle|Pascals_Triangle|  with 2 n rows and colors the even numbers white, and the odd numbers black, the result is an approximation to the Sierpinski triangle. More precisely, the  |limit|Limit_Of_A_Sequence|  as n approaches infinity of this  |parity|Parity| -colored 2 n -row Pascal triangle is the Sierpinski triangle. .       The  |Towers_of_Hanoi|Towers_Of_Hanoi|  puzzle involves moving disks of different sizes between three pegs, maintaining the property that no disk is ever placed on top of a smaller disk. The states of an n-disk puzzle, and the allowable moves from one state to another, form an  |undirected_graph|Undirected_Graph| , the  |Hanoi_graph|Hanoi_Graph| , that can be represented geometrically as the  |intersection_graph|Intersection_Graph|  of the set of triangles remaining after the nth step in the construction of the Sierpinski triangle. Thus, in the limit as n goes to infinity, this sequence of graphs can be interpreted as a discrete analogue of the Sierpinski triangle. .            For integer number of dimensions d, when doubling a side of an object, 2 d copies of it are created, i.e. 2 copies for 1-dimensional object, 4 copies for 2-dimensional object and 8 copies for 3-dimensional object. For the Sierpinski triangle, doubling its side creates 3 copies of itself. Thus the Sierpinski triangle has  |Hausdorff_dimension|Hausdorff_Dimension|      log 2  3  ≈  1.585, which follows from solving 2 d    3 for d.      The area of a Sierpinski triangle is zero . The area remaining after each iteration is  of the area from the previous iteration, and an infinite number of iterations results in an area approaching zero. .     The points of a Sierpinski triangle have a simple characterization in  |barycentric_coordinates|Barycentric_Coordinates_Barycentric_Coordinates_On_Triangles| .  If a point has coordinates , expressed as  |binary_numerals|Binary_Numeral| , then the point is in Sierpinskis triangle if and only if  for all i.       A generalization of the Sierpinski triangle can also be generated using  |Pascals_triangle|Pascals_Triangle|  if a different Modulo is used. Iteration n can be generated by taking a  |Pascals_triangle|Pascals_Triangle|  with P n rows and coloring numbers by their value for x  mod  P. As n approaches infinity, a fractal is generated.     The same fractal can be achieved by dividing a triangle into a tessellation of P 2 similar triangles and removing the triangles that are upside-down from the original, then iterating this step with each smaller triangle.     Conversely, the fractal can also be generated by beginning with a triangle and duplicating it and arranging  of the new figures in the same orientation into a larger similar triangle with the vertices of the previous figures touching, then iterating that step.                    The Sierpinski tetrahedron or tetrix is the three-dimensional analogue of the Sierpinski triangle, formed by repeatedly shrinking a regular  |tetrahedron|Tetrahedron|  to one half its original height, putting together four copies of this tetrahedron with corners touching, and then repeating the process.     A tetrix constructed from an initial tetrahedron of side-length L has the property that the total surface area remains constant with each iteration. The initial surface area of the tetrahedron of side-length L is L 2 . The next iteration consists of four copies with side length , so the total area is 4 2    4L 2 ·   L 2  again. Meanwhile the volume of the construction is halved at every step and therefore approaches zero. The limit of this process has neither volume nor surface but, like the Sierpinski gasket, is an intricately connected curve. Its  |Hausdorff_dimension|Hausdorff_Dimension|  is     2. If all points are projected onto a plane that is parallel to two of the outer edges, they exactly fill a square of side length  without overlap.             |Wacław_Sierpiński|Wacław_Sierpiński|  described the Sierpinski triangle in 1915. However, similar patterns appear already in the 13th-century  |Cosmati|Cosmati| |mosaics|Mosaic|  in the cathedral of  |Anagni|Anagni| ,  |Italy|Italy| ,  and other places of central Italy, for carpets in many places such as the nave of the Roman Basilica of  |Santa_Maria_in_Cosmedin|Santa_Maria_In_Cosmedin| , , 5 September 2011,  |Flickr|Flickr|  and for isolated triangles positioned in rotae in several churches and basilicas.  In the case of the isolated triangle, the iteration is at least of three levels.     A medieval triangle, with historically certain dating has been studied recently. It is in porphiry and golden leaf, isolated, level 4 iteration     The  |Apollonian_gasket|Apollonian_Gasket|  was first described by  |Apollonius_of_Perga|Apollonius_Of_Perga|  and further analyzed by  |Gottfried_Leibniz|Gottfried_Leibniz|  , and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle.           The usage of the word gasket to refer to the Sierpinski triangle refers to  |gaskets|Gasket|  such as are found in  |motors|Motor| , and which sometimes feature a series of holes of decreasing size, similar to the fractal; this usage was coined by  |Benoit_Mandelbrot|Benoit_Mandelbrot| , who thought the fractal looked similar to the part that prevents leaks in motors .
