              Gamma  is the third letter of the  |Greek_alphabet|Greek_Alphabet| . In the system of  |Greek_numerals|Greek_Numerals|  it has a value of 3. In  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek| , the letter gamma represented a  |voiced_velar_stop|Voiced_Velar_Stop|  . In  |Modern_Greek|Modern_Greek| , this letter represents either a  |voiced_velar_fricative|Voiced_Velar_Fricative|  or a  |voiced_palatal_fricative|Voiced_Palatal_Fricativepalatal| .     In the  |International_Phonetic_Alphabet|International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  and other modern Latin-alphabet based  |phonetic_notations|Phonetic_Transcriptionalphabetic| , it represents the voiced velar fricative.          The Greek letter Gamma Œì was derived from the  |Phoenician_letter|Phoenician_Alphabet|  for the /g/ phoneme , and as such is cognate with  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Alphabet|   gimel  ◊í.     Based on its name, the letter has been interpreted as an abstract representation of a  |camels|Camel|  neck,  but this has been criticized as contrived,  and it is more likely that the letter is derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph representing a club or  |throwing_stick|Throwing_Stick| .      In  |Archaic_Greece|Archaic_Greece| , the shape of gamma was closer to a classical  |lambda|Lambda|  , while lambda retained the Phoenician  |L|L| -shape .     Letters that arose from the Greek gamma include  |Etruscan|Old_Italic_Scriptetruscan_Alphabet|  êåÇ,  |Roman|Latin_Alphabet| |C|C|  and  |G|G| ,  |Runic|Elder_Futhark|   kaunan  ,  |Gothic|Gothic_Alphabet|  geuua , the  |Coptic|Coptic_Alphabet|  ‚≤Ñ, and the  |Cyrillic|Cyrillic_Script|  letters  |–ì|Ge|  and  |“ê|Ge_With_Upturn| .             The Ancient Greek /g/ phoneme was the voiced velar stop, continuing the reconstructed  |proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European_Phonology|  g, «µ.     The modern Greek phoneme represented by gamma is realized either as a  |voiced_palatal_fricative|Voiced_Palatal_Fricative|   before a  |front_vowel|Front_Vowel|  , or as a  |voiced_velar_fricative|Voiced_Velar_Fricative|   in all other environments. Both in Ancient and in Modern Greek, before other  |velar_consonants|Velar_Consonant|  , gamma represents a  |velar_nasal|Velar_Nasal|  . A double gamma Œ≥Œ≥ represents the sequence   or .       Lowercase Greek gamma is used in the  |Americanist_phonetic_notation|Americanist_Phonetic_Notation|  and  |Uralic_Phonetic_Alphabet|Uralic_Phonetic_Alphabet|  to indicate voiced consonants.     The gamma was also added to the Latin alphabet, as  |Latin_gamma|Latin_Gamma| , in the following forms: majuscule ∆î, minuscule …£, and superscript modifier letter À†.     In the  |International_Phonetic_Alphabet|International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  the minuscule letter is used to represent a  |voiced_velar_fricative|Voiced_Velar_Fricative|  and the superscript modifier letter is used to represent  |velarization|Velarization| . It is not to be confused with the character , which looks like a lowercase Latin gamma that lies above the  |baseline|Baseline|  rather than crossing, and which represents the  |close-mid_back_unrounded_vowel|Close-Mid_Back_Unrounded_Vowel| . In certain  |nonstandard_variations_of_the_IPA|Obsolete_And_Nonstandard_Symbols_In_The_International_Phonetic_Alphabet| , the uppercase form is used.     It is as a full-fledged majuscule and minuscule letter in the alphabets of some of  |languages_of_Africa|Languages_Of_Africa|  such as  |Dagbani|Dagbani_Language| ,  |Dinka|Dinka_Language| ,  |Kabye|Kabye_Language| , and  |Ewe|Ewe_Language| ,  and  |Berber_languages|Berber_Languages|  using the  |Berber_Latin_alphabet|Berber_Latin_Alphabet| .     It is sometimes also used in the romanization of  |Pashto|Pashto| .
