By contrast, a few nouns are slightly more complex in their forms. For example:          In that example, all four forms are pronounced in a distinct manner.     There can be other derivations from nouns that are not usually considered declensions. For example, the proper noun Britain has the associated descriptive adjective British and the demonym Briton. Though these words are clearly related and are generally considered cognates, they are not specifically treated as forms of the same word and thus not declensions.     Pronouns in English have even more complex declensions. For example:          Whereas nouns do not distinguish between the ": null

The one situation where gender is still clearly part of the English language is in the pronouns for the third person singular. Consider the following:          The distinguishing of neuter for persons and non-persons is somewhat peculiar to English. This has existed since the 14th century.   However, the use of the so-called singular they is often restricted to specific contexts, depending on the dialect or the speaker. It is most typically used to refer to a single person of unknown gender . Its use has expanded in recent years due to increasing social recognition of persons who do not identify themselves as male or female.  Note that the singular they still uses plural verb forms, reflecting its origins.     For nouns, in general, gender is not declined in Modern English, or at best one could argue there are isolated situations certain nouns may be modified to reflect gender, though not in a systematic fashion. Loan words from other languages, particularly Latin and the Romance languages, often preserve their gender-specific forms in English, e.g. alumnus and alumna . Similarly, names borrowed from other languages show comparable distinctions: Andrew and Andrea, Paul and Paula, etc. Additionally, suffixes such as -ess, -ette, and -er are sometimes applied to create overtly gendered versions of nouns, with marking for feminine being much more common than marking for masculine. Many nouns can actually function as members of two genders or even all three, and the gender classes of English nouns are usually determined by their agreement with pronouns, rather than marking on the nouns themselves.     Most adjectives are not declined. However, when used as nouns rather than adjectives, they do decline . Also, the demonstrative determiners this and that are declined for number, as these and those. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can be, declined for gender, at least in writing: blond and blonde . Adjectives are not declined for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English. The ": null
