Mali is located in Africa.   The history of the territory of modern  |Mali|Mali|  may be divided into:   Pre-Imperial Mali, before the 13th century   the history of the eponymous Mali Empire and of the Songhai Empire during the 13th to 16th centuries     The borders of Mali are those of French Sudan, drawn in 1891. They are artificial, and unite part of the larger  |Sudan|Sudan|  region with parts of the Sahara.   As a consequence, Mali is a multiethnic country, with a majority of its population consisting of  |Mandé_peoples|Mandé_Peoples| .     Malis history is dominated by its role in trans-Saharan trade, connecting West Africa and the Maghreb. The Malian city  |Timbuktu|Timbuktu|  is exemplary of this: situated on the southern fringe of the Sahara and close to the  |River_Niger|Niger_River| , it has played an important role in the trans-Saharan trade from the 13th century on, with the establishment of the  |Mali_Empire|Mali_Empire| .       The Mali Empire became Islamic in the early 14th century, under  |Musa_I|Musa_I|  of Mali. From that time until the 19th century, Timbuktu remained important as an outpost at the southwestern fringe of the Muslim world and a hub of the  |Arab_slave_trade|Arab_Slave_Trade| .      |Mandinka|Mandinka_People|  from c. 1230 to c. 1600. The empire was founded by  |Sundiata_Keita|Sundiata_Keita|  and became known for the  |wealth|Wealth|  of its rulers, especially  |Mansa|Mansa| |_Musa_I|Mansa_Musa| . The Mali Empire had many profound cultural influences on West Africa, allowing the spread of its language, laws and customs along the  |Niger_River|Niger_River| . It extended over a large area and consisted of numerous  |vassal_kingdoms|Vassal_Kingdom|  and provinces.     The Mali Empire began to weaken in the 15th century, but it remained dominant for much of the 15th. It survived into the 16th century, but by then had lost much of its former strength and importance.       The Mali Empire began to weaken by the mid 14th century. The  |Songhai|Songhai_People|  took advantage of this and asserted their independence. The Songhai made Gao their capital and began an imperial expansion of their own throughout the western  |Sahel|Sahel| . And by 1420, Songhai was strong enough to exact tribute from Masina.   The emerging  |Songhai_Empire|Songhai_Empire|  and the declining  |Mali_Empire|Mali_Empire|  co-existed during much of the later 14th and throughout the 15th century. In the later 15th century, control of  |Timbuktu|Timbuktu|  shifted to the Songhai Empire.       The Songhai empire eventually collapsed under the pressure from the Moroccan  |Saadi_dynasty|Saadi_Dynasty| . The turning-point was the  |Battle_of_Tondibi|Battle_Of_Tondibi|  of 13 March 1591. Morocco subsequently controlled  |Gao|Gao| ,  |Timbuktu|Pashalik_Of_Timbuktu| ,  |Djenné|Djenné|  , and related trade routes with much difficulty until around the end of the 17th century.        After the collapse of the Songhai Empire, no single state controlled the region. The Moroccans only succeeded in occupying a few portions of the country, and even in those locations where they did attempt to rule, their hold was weak and challenged by rivals. Several small successor kingdoms arose. the most notable in what is now Mali were:             The Bambara Empire existed as a centralized state from 1712 to 1861, was based at  |Ségou|Ségou|  and also Timbuktu , and ruled parts of central and southern Mali. It existed until El Hadj  |Umar_Tall|Umar_Tall| , a  |Toucouleur|Toucouleur_People|  conqueror swept across West Africa from  |Futa_Tooro|Futa_Tooro| . Umar Talls mujahideen readily defeated the Bambara, seizing Ségou itself on March 10, 1861 and declaring an end to the empire.          A split in the Coulibaly dynasty in Ségou led to the establishment of a second Bambara state, the kingdom of Kaarta, in what is now western Mali, in 1753. It was defeated in 1854 by  |Umar_Tall|Umar_Tall| , leader of  |Toucouleur_Empire|Toucouleur_Empire| , before his war with Ségou.          The  |Senufo|Senufo_People|  Kenedugu Kingdom originated in the 17th century in the area around what is now the border of Mali and  |Burkina_Faso|Burkina_Faso| . In 1876 the capital was moved to  |Sikasso|Sikasso| . It resisted the effort of  |Samori_Ture|Samori| , leader of  |Wassoulou_Empire|Wassoulou_Empire| , in 1887, to conquer it, and was one of the last kingdoms in the area to fall to the French in 1898.          An Islamic-inspired uprising in the largely  |Fula|Fula_People| |_Inner_Niger_Delta|Inner_Niger_Delta|  region against rule by Ségou in 1818 led to establishment of a separate state. It later allied with  |Bambara_Empire|Bambara_Empire|  against  |Umar_Talls|Umar_Tall| |_Toucouleur_Empire|Toucouleur_Empire|  and was also defeated by it in 1862.          This empire, founded by  |El_Hadj_Umar_Tall|El_Hadj_Umar_Tall|  of the  |Toucouleur_peoples|Toucouleur_People| , beginning in 1864, ruled eventually most of what is now Mali until the French conquest of the region in 1890. This was in some ways a turbulent period, with ongoing resistance in Massina and increasing pressure from the French.          The Wassoulou or Wassulu Empire was a short-lived empire, led by  |Samori_Ture|Samori|  in the predominantly  |Malinké|Mandinka_People|  area of what is now upper  |Guinea|Guinea|  and southwestern Mali . It later moved to  |Ivory_Coast|Ivory_Coast|  before being conquered by the French.            Mali fell under French colonial rule in 1892.  In 1893, the French appointed a civilian governor of the territory they called Soudan Français , but active resistance to French rule continued. By 1905, most of the area was under firm French control.     French Sudan was administered as part of the Federation of  |French_West_Africa|French_West_Africa|  and supplied labor to France’s colonies on the coast of West Africa. In 1958 the renamed Sudanese Republic obtained complete internal autonomy and joined the French Community. In early 1959, the Sudanese Republic and Senegal formed the Federation of Mali. On 31 March 1960 France agreed to the Federation of Mali becoming fully independent.  On 20 June 1960 the Federation of Mali became an independent country and  |Modibo_Keïta|Modibo_Keïta|  became its first President.          Following the withdrawal of Senegal from the federation in August 1960, the former Sudanese Republic became the Republic of Mali on 22 September 1960, with Modibo Keïta as president.     President  |Modibo_Keïta|Modibo_Keïta| , whose  |Sudanese_Union_African_Democratic_Rally|Sudanese_Union_African_Democratic_Rally|  party had dominated pre-independence politics , moved quickly to declare a single-party state and to pursue a  |socialist|Socialist|  policy based on extensive  |nationalization|Nationalization| . Keïta withdrew from the French Community and also had close ties to the  |Eastern_bloc|Eastern_Bloc| . A continuously deteriorating economy led to a decision to rejoin the Franc Zone in 1967 and modify some of the economic excesses.       On November 19, 1968, a group of young officers staged a bloodless coup and set up a 14-member Military Committee for National Liberation , with Lt.  |Moussa_Traoré|Moussa_Traoré|  as president. The military leaders attempted to pursue economic reforms, but for several years faced debilitating internal political struggles and the disastrous Sahelian drought.     A new constitution, approved in 1974, created a one-party state and was designed to move Mali toward civilian rule. However, the military leaders remained in power. In September 1976, a new political party was established, the Democratic Union of the Malian People , based on the concept of  |democratic_centralism|Democratic_Centralism| . Single-party presidential and legislative elections were held in June 1979, and Gen. Moussa Traoré received 99% of the votes. His efforts at consolidating the single-party government were challenged in 1980 by student-led anti-government demonstrations that led to three coup attempts, which were brutally quashed.     The political situation stabilized during 1981 and 1982, and remained generally calm throughout the 1980s. In late December 1985, however, a border dispute between Mali and  |Burkina_Faso|Burkina_Faso|  over the mineral rich  |Agacher_strip|Agacher_Strip_War|  erupted into a brief war. The UDPM spread its structure to  |Cercles|Cercle|  and Arrondissements across the land.     Shifting its attention to Malis economic difficulties, the government approved plans for some reforms of the state enterprise system, and attempted to control public corruption. It implemented cereal marketing liberalization, created new incentives to private enterprise, and worked out a new structural adjustment agreement with the  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund|  . But the populace became increasingly dissatisfied with the austerity measures imposed by the IMF plan as well as their perception that the ruling elite was not subject to the same strictures. In response to the growing demands for multiparty democracy then sweeping the continent, the Traoré regime did allow some limited political liberalization. In National Assembly elections in June 1988, multiple UDPM candidates were permitted to contest each seat, and the regime organized nationwide conferences to consider how to implement democracy within the one-party framework. Nevertheless, the regime refused to usher in a full-fledged democratic system.     However, by 1990, cohesive opposition movements began to emerge, including the National Democratic Initiative Committee and the  |Alliance_for_Democracy_in_Mali|Alliance_For_Democracy_In_Mali|  . The increasingly turbulent political situation was complicated by the rise of ethnic violence in the north in mid-1990. The return to Mali of large numbers of  |Tuareg|Tuareg_People|  who had migrated to  |Algeria|Algeria|  and  |Libya|Libya|  during the prolonged drought increased tensions in the region between the nomadic Tuareg and the sedentary population. Ostensibly fearing a Tuareg secessionist movement in the north, the Traoré regime imposed a state of emergency and harshly repressed Tuareg unrest. Despite the signing of a peace accord in January 1991, unrest and periodic armed clashes continued.       As in other African countries, demands for multi-party democracy increased. The Traoré government allowed some opening of the system, including the establishment of an independent press and independent political associations, but insisted that Mali was not ready for democracy. In early 1991, student-led anti-government rioting broke out again, but this time it was supported also by government workers and others. On March 26, 1991, after 4 days of intense anti-government rioting, a group of 17 military officers, led by  |Amadou_Toumani_Touré|Amadou_Toumani_Touré| , arrested President Traoré and suspended the constitution.     Within days, these officers joined with the Coordinating Committee of Democratic Associations to form a predominantly civilian, 25-member ruling body, the  |Transitional_Committee_for_the_Salvation_of_the_People_|Transitional_Committee_For_The_Salvation_Of_The_People_Of_The_Republic_Of_Mali|  The CTSP then appointed a civilian-led government. A national conference held in August 1991 produced a draft constitution , a charter for political parties, and an electoral code. Political parties were allowed to form freely. Between January and April 1992, a president, National Assembly, and municipal councils were elected. On June 8, 1992,  |Alpha_Oumar_Konaré|Alpha_Oumar_Konaré| , the candidate of ADEMA, was inaugurated as the president of Malis Third Republic.     In 1997, attempts to renew national institutions through democratic elections ran into administrative difficulties, resulting in a court-ordered annulment of the legislative elections held in April 1997. The exercise, nonetheless, demonstrated the overwhelming strength of President Konarés ADEMA party, causing some other historic parties to boycott subsequent elections. President Konaré won the presidential election against scant opposition on May 11. In the two-round legislative elections conducted on July 21 and August 3, ADEMA secured over 80% of the National Assembly seats.         Konaré stepped down after his constitutionally mandated limit of two terms and did not run in the 2002 elections. Touré then reemerged, this time as a civilian. Running as an independent on a platform of national unity, Touré won the presidency in a runoff against the candidate of Adema, which had been divided by infighting and suffered from the creation of a spin-off party, the  |Rally_for_Mali|Rassemblement_Pour_Le_Mali| . Touré had retained great popularity because of his role in the transitional government in 1991–92. The 2002 election was a milestone, marking Malis first successful transition from one democratically elected president to another, despite the persistence of electoral irregularities and low voter turnout. In the 2002 legislative elections, no party gained a majority; Touré then appointed a politically inclusive government and pledged to tackle Mali’s pressing social and economic development problems.
