A similar crisis, although not escalating to the point of military threats, occurred in 1981 when the Keban Dam reservoir had to be refilled after it had been almost emptied to temporarily increase Turkeys hydroelectricity production.  In 1984, Turkey unilaterally declared that it would ensure a flow of at least  per second, or  per year, into Syria, and in 1987 a bilateral treaty to that effect was signed between the two countries.  Another bilateral agreement from 1989 between Syria and Iraq settles the amount of water flowing into Iraq at 60 percent of the amount that Syria receives from Turkey.  In 2008, Turkey, Syria and Iraq instigated the Joint Trilateral Committee on the management of the water in the Tigris–Euphrates basin and on 3 September 2009 a further agreement was signed to this effect.    On April 15, 2014, Turkey began to reduce the flow of the Euphrates into Syria and Iraq. The flow was cut off completely on May 16, 2014 resulting in the Euphrates terminating at the Turkish–Syrian border.
