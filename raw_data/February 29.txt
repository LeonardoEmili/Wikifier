                     February 29, also known as leap day or leap year day, is a date added to most years that are  |divisible|Divisor|  by 4, such as  |2016|2016| ,  |2020|2020| , and  |2024|2024| . A leap day is added in various  |solar_calendars|Solar_Calendar|  , including the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar|  standard in most of the world.  |Lunisolar_calendars|Lunisolar_Calendar|   instead add a leap or  |intercalary|Intercalation|  month.      In the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| , years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus,  |1700|1700| ,  |1800|1800| , and  |1900|1900|  did not contain a leap day; neither will  |2100|2100| ,  |2200|2200| , and  |2300|2300| . Conversely,  |1600|1600|  and  |2000|2000|  did and  |2400|2400|  will. Years containing a leap day are called  |leap_years|Leap_Year| . Years not containing a leap day are called  |common_years|Common_Year| . February 29 is the 60th day of the Gregorian calendar, in such a year, with 306 days remaining until the end of the year. In the  |Chinese_calendar|Chinese_Calendar| , this day will only occur in years of the  |monkey|Monkey| ,  |dragon|Dragon| , and  |rat|Rat| .     A leap day is observed because the  |Earths|Earth|  period of  |orbit|Orbit| al revolution around the  |Sun|Sun|  takes approximately 6 hours longer than 365 whole days. A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the  |Earths|Earth|  position in the  |Solar_System|Solar_System| ; otherwise, seasons would occur later than intended in the calendar year. The  |Julian_calendar|Julian_Calendar|  used in Christendom until the  |16th_century|16Th_Century|  added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days , making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11, and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the century rule to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of  |Easter|Easter|  consistently close to the  |vernal_equinox|Vernal_Equinox| .           Although most modern calendar years have 365 days, a complete revolution around the Sun  takes approximately 365 days and 6 hours. An extra 24 hours thus accumulates every four years, requiring that an extra calendar day be added to align the calendar with the Suns apparent position. Without the added day, in future years the  |seasons|Season|  would occur later in the calendar, eventually leading to confusion about when to undertake activities dependent on weather,  |ecology|Ecology| , or hours of daylight.     Solar years are actually slightly shorter than 365 days and 6 hours , which had been known since the 2nd century BC when  |Hipparchus|Hipparchus|  stated that it lasted 365 +  −  days,  but this was ignored by  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  and his astronomical adviser  |Sosigenes|Sosigenes_Of_Alexandria| . The Gregorian calendar corrected this by adopting the length of the tropical year stated in three medieval sources, the  |Alfonsine_tables|Alfonsine_Tables| ,  |De_Revolutionibus|De_Revolutionibus| , and the  |Prutenic_Tables|Prutenic_Tables| , truncated to two  |sexagesimal|Sexagesimal|  places, 365   days or 365 +  −  days or 365.2425 days.  The length of the tropical year in 2000 was 365.24217 mean solar days,  Adding a calendar day every four years, therefore, results in an excess of around 44 minutes every four years, or about 3 days every 400 years. To compensate for this, three days are removed every 400 years. The  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar|  reform implements this adjustment by making an exception to the general rule that there is a leap year every four years. Instead, a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless that year is also  |divisible_by_400|Century_Leap_Year| . This means that the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, while the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.       The Gregorian calendar repeats itself every 400 years, which is exactly 20,871 weeks including 97 leap days . Over this period, February 29 falls on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday 13 times each; 14 times each on Friday and Saturday; and 15 times each on Monday and Wednesday. Excepting when a century mark that is not a multiple of 400 intervenes, consecutive leaps days fall in order Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday, and Saturday; then repeating with Thursday again.             The calendar of the Roman king  |Numa_Pompilius|Numa_Pompilius|  had only 355 days which meant that it would quickly become unsynchronized with the solar year. An earlier Roman solution to this problem was to lengthen the calendar periodically by adding extra days to February, the last month of the year. February consisted of two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the  Terminalia  on the 23rd, which was considered the end of the religious year, and the five remaining days formed the second part. To keep the calendar year roughly aligned with the solar year,  |a_leap_month|Intercalation| , called  |Mensis_Intercalaris|Intercalaris|  , was added from time to time between these two parts of February. The second part of February was incorporated in the intercalary month as its last five days, with no change either in their dates or the festivals observed on them. This followed naturally, because the days after the Ides of February or the Ides of Intercalaris both counted down to the Kalends of March . The Nones and Ides of Intercalaris occupied their normal positions.     The third-century writer Censorinus says:          The set leap day was introduced in Rome as a part of the  |Julian_reform|Julian_Calendarjulian_Reform|  in the 1st century BC. As before, the intercalation was made after February 23. The day following the  |Terminalia|Terminus|  was doubled, forming the bis sextum —literally twice sixth, since February 24 was the sixth day before the  |Kalends|Kalends|  of March using Roman inclusive counting . Inclusive counting initially caused the Roman priests to add the extra day every three years instead of four;  |Augustus|Augustus|  was compelled to omit leap years for a few decades to return the calendar to its proper position. Although there were exceptions, the first day of the bis sextum was usually regarded as the intercalated or bissextile day since the 3rd century AD. Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens, The Oxford companion to the year 678–680. February 29 came to be regarded as the leap day when the Roman system of numbering days was replaced by sequential numbering in the late Middle Ages, although this has only been formally enacted in  |Sweden|Sweden|  and  |Finland|Finland| . In  |Britain|Uk| , the extra day added to leap years remains notionally the 24th, although the 29th remains more visible on the calendar. .       A person born on February 29 may be called a leapling , a leaper , or a leap-year baby .  In non-leap years, some leaplings celebrate their  |birthday|Birthday|  on either February 28 or March 1, while others only observe birthdays on the authentic  |intercalary|Intercalation|  date, February 29.       The effective legal date of a leaplings birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions.     In the United Kingdom and its former colony Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29  |turns_18|Age_Of_Majority| , they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year.   . Department of Justice. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Peoples Republic of China. June 30, 1997.     In New Zealand, a person born on February 29 is deemed to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years, for the purposes of Driver Licensing under §2 of the Land Transport Rule 1999.  The net result is that for drivers aged 75, or over 80, their driver licence expires at the end of the last day of February, even though their birthday would otherwise fall on the first day in March in non-leap years. Otherwise, New Zealand legislation is silent on when a person born on 29 February has their birthday, although case law  would suggest that age is computed based on the number of years elapsed, from the day after the date of birth, and that the persons birth day then occurs on the last day of the year period. This differs from English common law where a birthday is considered to be the start of the next year, the preceding year ending at midnight on the day preceding the birthday. While a person attains the same age on the same day, it also means that, in New Zealand, if something must be done by the time a person attains a certain age, that thing can be done on the birthday that they attain that age and still be lawful.     In  |Taiwan|Taiwan| , the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:     :If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which proceeds the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence. But if there is no corresponding day in the last month, the period ends with the ending of the last day of the last month. Article 121 of the  |Civil_Code_Part_I_General_Principles|S_Civil_Code_Part_I_General_Principles|  of the  |Republic_of_China|Republic_Of_China|  in effect in Taiwan.     Thus, in England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If they were born in Taiwan they legally become 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, according to John Reitz, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, there is no ... statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day.  Reitz speculates that March 1 would likely be considered the legal birthday in non-leap years of someone born on leap day, using the same reasoning as described for the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.       There are many instances in childrens literature where a persons claim to be only a quarter of their actual age turns out to be based on counting only their leap-year birthdays.
