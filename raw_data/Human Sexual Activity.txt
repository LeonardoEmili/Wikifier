            Human sexual activity, human sexual practice or human sexual behaviour is the manner in which humans experience and express their  |sexuality|Human_Sexuality| . People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone  to acts with another person  in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in  |sexual_arousal|Sexual_Arousal|  and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the  |sex_life|Sex_Life|  of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners , or personal interactions between individuals . Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.     Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive,  |emotional|Emotional_Intimacy| ,  |behavioural|Physical_Intimacy|  and biological aspects; these include  |personal_bonding|Human_Bonding| , sharing emotions and the  |physiology|Physiology|  of the  |reproductive_system|Reproductive_System| ,  |sex_drive|Sex_Drive| , sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.     In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while  |premarital|Premarital_Sex|  and  |extramarital_sex|Extramarital_Sex|  are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the  |norms|Norm|  of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most  |jurisdictions|Jurisdiction|  are  |sexual_assault|Sexual_Assault|  and sexual activity with a person below the local  |age_of_consent|Age_Of_Consent| .             Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person  such as  |masturbation|Masturbation| , or two or more people such as  |vaginal_sex|Sexual_Intercourse| ,  |anal_sex|Anal_Sex| ,  |oral_sex|Oral_Sex|  or  |mutual_masturbation|Mutual_Masturbation| .  |Penetrative_sex|Sexual_Penetration|  between two people may be described as  |sexual_intercourse|Sexual_Intercourse| , but definitions vary. If there are more than two participants in a sex act, it may be referred to as  |group_sex|Group_Sex| . Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of  |dildos|Dildo| ,  |vibrators|Vibrator| ,  |butt_plugs|Butt_Plug| , and other  |sex_toys|Sex_Toy| , though these devices can also be used with a partner.     Sexual activity can be classified into the  |gender|Gender|  and  |sexual_orientation|Sexual_Orientation|  of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage,  |intimate_partners|Intimate_Partner| , casual  |sex_partners|Sex_Partners|  or  |anonymous|Anonymous_Sex| . Sexual activity can be regarded as  |conventional|Conventional_Sex|  or as  |alternative|Kink| , involving, for example,  |fetishism|Sexual_Fetishism| ,  |paraphilia|Paraphilia| , or  |BDSM|Bdsm|  activities.   Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include  |erotic_asphyxiation|Erotic_Asphyxiation|  and  |self-bondage|Self-Bondage| . The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes  becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.     Sexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called  |sexual_assault|Sexual_Assault|  or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to  |social_norms|Social_Norms|  or generally accepted  |sexual_morals|Sexual_Morals| .       In  |evolutionary_psychology|Evolutionary_Psychology|  and  |behavioral_ecology|Behavioral_Ecology| , human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain  |mates|Mating| . Mating strategies overlap with  |reproductive|Reproductive|  strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring .     Relative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of  |marriage|Marriage| . Low, B. S. . . Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449. Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term  |intimate_relationship|Intimate_Relationship| , marriage,  |casual_relationship|Casual_Relationship| , or  |friendship|Friendship| . The human desire for  |companionship|Companionship|  is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the  |sex_drive|Sex_Drive| . The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the  |courtship|Courtship|  process and the process of forming an  |interpersonal_relationship|Interpersonal_Relationship| . Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior .          The  |physiological_responses|Human_Sexual_Response_Cycle|  during  |sexual_stimulation|Sexual_Stimulation|  are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.    During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a  |sex_flush|Sex_Flush|  on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a womans  |vagina|Vagina|  becomes lubricated and her  |clitoris|Clitoris|  becomes swollen. A mans  |penis|Penis|  will become erect.   During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A mans urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with  |semen|Semen| . A womans clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.   During the  |orgasm|Orgasm|  phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having  |faked_it|Fake_Orgasm| . A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.   During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a  |refractory_period|Refractory_Period|  and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first,   some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.  This period may last from minutes to days and is typically longer for men than women.      |Sexual_dysfunction|Sexual_Dysfunction|  is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm. Kontula, O & Mannila, E . Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire. Routledge, 46. retrieved 20 August 2012, from  In the media, sexual dysfunction is often associated with men, but in actuality, it is more commonly observed in females than males .             Sexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age. It serves to release tension, elevate mood, and possibly create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, theyre regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations.  A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day. Though its usually a stress reliever, sex can become stressful when partners worry about their performance.             People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: physical attraction, as a means to an end, to increase emotional connection, and to alleviate insecurity. Meston & Buss, 2007.     Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the  |arousal_of_their_sexuality|Sexual_Arousal| , especially if they can achieve  |orgasm|Orgasm| . Sexual arousal can also be experienced from  |foreplay|Foreplay|  and flirting, and from  |fetish|Fetishism|  or BDSM activities,  or other  |erotic_activities|Eroticism| . Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the  |sexual_desire|Sexual_Desire|  generated by a person to whom they feel  |sexual_attraction|Sexual_Attraction| ; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of  |casual_or_social_sex|Casual_Sex| .  At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.     A person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of  |conception|Fertilisation| . Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten  |sexual_tension|Sexual_Tension| , attraction and interest.      It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species.  |Joan_Roughgarden|Joan_Roughgarden| , in her book Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People, postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.        Research has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with  |self-determination_theory|Self-Determination_Theory| . The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership.  Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation. The purpose of this model is to connect self-determination and sexual motivation.  This model has helped to explain how people are sexually motivated when involved in self-determined dating relationships. This model also links the positive outcomes, gained from sexual motivations.     According to the completed research associated with this model, it was found that people of both sexes who engaged in sexual activity for self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being. While engaging in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment. When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship. Though both sexes engaged in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females. It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual activity for self-determined reasons. Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity. Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.             The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero  to 15 or 20 times a week.  In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.   It is generally recognized that  |postmenopausal|Menopause|  women experience declines in frequency of sexual intercourse  and that average frequency of intercourse declines with age. According to the  |Kinsey_Institute|Kinsey_Institute_For_Research_In_Sex,_Gender,_And_Reproduction| , the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the US for individuals who have partners is 112 times per year , 86 times per year , and 69 times per year .           The age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time.  The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the  |sexualization|Sexualization|  of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of  |virginity|Virginity|  or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the  |age_of_consent|Age_Of_Consent| .     A 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are shown to be more sexually active than White adolescents. Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.     Research on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity. Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred.  Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.     Although opinions differ, others suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex. According to a research study, sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction.  In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, it stated that teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 and 2009 at a rural upstate New York community. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17. Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.       Sexual activity is an innately physiological function, Xiaojun Chen, Xuerui Tan, Qingying Zhang, , Medknow Publications, December 2009 but like other physical activity, it comes with risks. There are four main types of risks that may arise from sexual activity:  |unwanted_pregnancy|Unintended_Pregnancy| , contracting a  |sexually_transmitted_infection|Sexually_Transmitted_Disease|  , physical injury, and psychological injury.          Any sexual activity that involves the introduction of semen into a womans vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, may result in a pregnancy.  To reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use  |contraception|Birth_Control| , such as  |birth_control_pills|Birth_Control_Pill| , a  |condom|Condom| ,  |diaphragms|Diaphragm| ,  |spermicides|Spermicide| ,  |hormonal_contraception|Hormonal_Contraception|  or sterilization.  Retrieved 11 October 2009. The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.             Sexual activity that involves skin-to-skin contact, exposure to an infected persons  |bodily_fluids|Bodily_Fluid|  or  |mucosal_membranes|Mucosal_Membrane|     carries the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection. People may not be able to detect that their  |sexual_partner|Sexual_Partner|  has one or more STIs, for example if they are asymptomatic . King, B. . Human Sexuality Today . Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, Inc.  The risk of STIs can be reduced by  |safe_sex|Safe_Sex|  practices, such as using condoms. Both partners may opt be tested for STIs before engaging in sex.  The exchange of body fluids is not necessary to contract an infestation of crab lice. Crab lice typically are found attached to hair in the pubic area but sometimes are found on coarse hair elsewhere on the body . Pubic lice infestations are spread through direct contact with someone who is infested with the louse.        Some STIs like  |HIV/AIDS|Hiv/Aids|  can also be contracted by using  |IV_drug|Drug_Injection| |needles|Hypodermic_Needle|  after their use by an infected person, as well as through childbirth or  |breastfeeding|Breastfeeding| .          Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.

Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on  |social_policy|Social_Policy| , marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage.  |Sodomy_laws|Sodomy_Laws|  were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing  |sexual_abuse|Sexual_Abuse| , committing sexual acts with anyone under an  |age_of_consent|Age_Of_Consent| , performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money . Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.  Retrieved 13 October 2009.     Different-sex sexual practices may be  |monogamous|Monogamy| , serially monogamous, or  |polyamorous|Polyamory| , and, depending on the definition of sexual practice,  |abstinent|Abstinence|  or  |autoerotic|Autosexuality|  . Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.                Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.  Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.  American Psychological Association, Retrieved 25 December 2014     It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being  |closeted|Closeted|  . Closet case is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called  |coming_out_of_the_closet|Coming_Out_Of_The_Closet|  in the case of voluntary disclosure or  |outing|Outing|  in the case of disclosure by others against the subjects wishes . Among some communities , same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure.  |Men_who_have_sex_with_men|Men_Who_Have_Sex_With_Men| , as well as  |women_who_have_sex_with_women|Women_Who_Have_Sex_With_Women| , or men on the down-low may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.     People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender . In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same sex sexual activity before defining their  |sexual_identity|Sexual_Identity| . Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners  –  |tribadism|Tribadism|   and  |frot|Frot|  .          People who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual.   People who have a distinct but not exclusive preference for one sex/gender over the other may also identify themselves as bisexual.

The development of  |the_contraceptive_pill|Combined_Oral_Contraceptive_Pill|  and other highly effective forms of  |contraception|Contraception|  in the mid- and late 20th century has increased peoples ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure and also as a means of emotional intimacy , thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future . This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse , experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion , and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy .                Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from peoples sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed  |moral_codes|Moral_Code|  covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence peoples sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of  |extramarital_sexual_relations|Extramarital_Sex| , it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.     On the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity.  |Hedonism|Hedonism|  is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only  |intrinsic_good|Intrinsic_Value| . , 20 April 2004  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy      Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as  |sexual_morality|Sexual_Ethics|  and sexual norms .     Sexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality,  |fidelity|Fidelity|  and consent. Some activities, known as  |sex_crimes|Sex_And_The_Law|  in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between consenting and competent adults .     Some people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts,  |online_chat_rooms|Online_Chat_Room| , or, advertising in select media.      |Swinging|Swinging| , on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a  |committed_relationship|Committed_Relationship|  engaging in sexual activities with others as a  |recreational|Recreational_Sex|  or social activity.    The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the  |sexual_revolution|Sexual_Revolution|  of the 1960s.     Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the  |adult_industry|Sex_Industry|  include  |phone_sex|Phone_Sex|  operators,  |strip_clubs|Strip_Club| , and pornography.       Social  |gender_roles|Gender_Roles|  can influence sexual behavior as well as the reaction of individuals and communities to certain incidents; the  |World_Health_Organization|World_Health_Organization|  states that, Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence.  Some societies, such as those where the concepts of  |family_honor|Family_Honor|  and female  |chastity|Chastity|  are very strong, may practice violent control of female sexuality, through practices such as  |honor_killings|Honor_Killings|  and  |female_genital_mutilation|Female_Genital_Mutilation| .       The relation between  |gender_equality|Gender_Equality|  and sexual expression is recognized, and promotion of equity between men and women is crucial for attaining  |sexual|Sexual_Health|  and  |reproductive_health|Reproductive_Health| , as stated by the UN  |International_Conference_on_Population_and_Development|International_Conference_On_Population_And_Development|  Program of Action:      : Human sexuality and gender relations are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive lives. Equal relationships between men and women in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body, require mutual respect and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of sexual behaviour. Responsible sexual behaviour, sensitivity and equity in gender relations, particularly when instilled during the formative years, enhance and promote respectful and harmonious partnerships between men and women.                BDSM is a variety of  |erotic|Eroticism|  practices or  |roleplaying|Sexual_Roleplay|  involving  |bondage|Bondage| ,  |dominance_and_submission|Dominance_And_Submission| ,  |sadomasochism|Sadomasochism| , and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on  |self-identification|Self-Identification|  and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include  |cross-dressers|Cross-Dresser| , extreme  |body_modification|Body_Modification|  enthusiasts,  |animal_players|Animal_Roleplay| , latex or  |rubber_aficionados|Rubber_Fetishism| , and others.     B/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline. Bondage includes the restraint of the body or mind.  D/S means dominant and submissive. A dominant is someone who takes control of someone who wishes to give up control. A submissive is someone who gives up the control to a person who wishes to take control. S/M means an individual who takes pleasure in the humiliation or pain of others. Masochism means an individual who takes pleasure from their own pain or humiliation.     Unlike the usual power neutral relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of  |informed_consent|Informed_Consent|  of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or  |tops|Top| , while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or  |bottoms|Bottom| .     Individuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a dom for a man or a woman. Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term Domme . Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken. Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as switches. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.       In a 2013 study, the researchers state that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,   use suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual.  The study serves to challenge the widespread notion that BDSM could be in some way linked to  |psychopathology|Psychopathology| . According to the findings, one who participates in BDSM may have greater strength socially and mentally as well as greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM. It suggests that people who participate in BDSM play have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all recorded as consensual and pleasurable to both parties.     In a 2015 study, interviewed BDSM participants have mentioned that the activities have helped to create higher levels of connection, intimacy, trust and communication between partners. The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each others pleasure and to satisfy a need. The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominants confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.
