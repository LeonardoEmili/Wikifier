In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , an identity element or neutral element is a special type of element of a  |set|Set|  with respect to a  |binary_operation|Binary_Operation|  on that set, which leaves any element of the set unchanged when combined with it. This concept is used in  |algebraic_structures|Algebraic_Structure|  such as  |groups|Group|  and  |rings|Ring| . The term identity element is often shortened to identity when there is no possibility of confusion, but the identity implicitly depends on the binary operation it is associated with.     Let  be a set   with a binary operation  âˆ— on it. Then an element   of   is called a  left identity if  for all   in  , and a  right identity if  for all   in  .  If  is both a left identity and a right identity, then it is called a two-sided identity, or simply an identity.         An identity with respect to addition is called an  |additive_identity|Additive_Identity|  and an identity with respect to multiplication is called a  |multiplicative_identity|Multiplicative_Identity|  . These need not be ordinary addition and multiplication, but rather arbitrary operations. The distinction is used most often for sets that support both binary operations, such as  |rings|Ring| ,  |integral_domains|Integral_Domain| , and  |fields|Field| . The multiplicative identity is often called unity in the latter context .    This should not be confused with a  |unit|Unit|  in ring theory, which is any element having a  |multiplicative_inverse|Multiplicative_Inverse| . Unity itself is necessarily a unit.                As the last example shows, it is possible for to have several left identities. In fact, every element can be a left identity. Similarly, there can be several right identities. But if there is both a right identity and a left identity, then they are equal and there is just a single two-sided identity. To see this, note that if is a left identity and is a right identity then . In particular, there can never be more than one two-sided identity. If there were two, and , then would have to be equal to both and .     It is also quite possible for to have no.
