Foreign relations of the Egypt  are the Egyptian governments external relations with the outside world. Egypts foreign policy operates along a non-aligned level. Factors such as population size, historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in the  |Middle_East|Middle_East| ,  |Africa|Africa| , and within the  |Non-Aligned_Movement|Non-Aligned_Movement|  as a whole.  |Cairo|Cairo|  has been a crossroads of the  |Arab_worlds|Arab_World|  commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and  |Islam|Islam| ic institutions are at the center of the regions social and cultural landmarks.         The  |Arab_League|Arab_League|  headquarters is in  |Cairo|Cairo| , and the Secretary General of the League is traditionally an Egyptian. Former  |Egyptian_Foreign_Minister|Egyptian_Foreign_Minister| |Ahmed_Aboul_Gheit|Ahmed_Aboul_Gheit|  is the present Secretary General of the Arab League. Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister  |Boutros_Boutros-Ghali|Boutros_Boutros-Ghali|  served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996..     Egypt is on good terms with  |Libya|Libya| , its western neighbor.     Egypt has fairly good relations with  |Sudan|Sudan| , its southern neighbor, although it has a land dispute with Sudan over the  |Halaib_Triangle|Halaib_Triangle| , a small area of land on the Egypt-Sudan border on the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea|  coast. Sudan claims the area. Egypts policy on Sudan is that it is in favor of a united Sudan. As such Egypt was not directly involved in the Sudan Peace Process that was hosted in Kenya under the auspices of  |IGAD|Igad|  and that gave the peoples of south Sudan the right to secede and form an independent state in 2011 after the long and brutal Sudanese civil war that cumulatively lasted more than 40 years and claimed over 2 million lives.       Egypt has been seeking to play a role in the resolution of the  |Israeli–Palestinian_conflict|Israeli–Palestinian_Conflict| .     Egypt played an important role in the negotiations leading to the  |Madrid_Conference_of_1991|Madrid_Conference_Of_1991| , which, under  |United_States|United_States|  and  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  sponsorship, brought together all parties in the region, including for the first time a Palestinian delegation, to discuss Middle East peace.     This support has continued to the present, with former President  |Hosni_Mubarak|Hosni_Mubarak|  often intervening personally to promote peace negotiations. In 1996, he hosted the Sharm El-Sheikh Summit of the Peacemakers attended by President  |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  and other world leaders.     In 2000, he hosted two summits at  |Sharm_El-Sheikh|Sharm_El-Sheikh|  and one at  |Taba|Taba_Summit|  in an effort to resume the Camp David negotiations suspended in July 2000, and in June 2003, Mubarak hosted President  |George_W._Bush|George_W._Bush|  for another summit on Middle East peace process. Another summit was convened in Sharm El Sheik in early 2005, which was attended by Egypt,  |Israel|Israel| , the  |Palestinian_Authority|Palestinian_Authority|  and  |Jordan|Jordan| . The Egyptian Chief of Intelligence, General  |Omar_Suleiman|Omar_Suleiman| , has played a substantial role in negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides and is highly respected on both sides.       In the 21st-century Egypt has encountered a major problem with immigration, as millions of Africans attempt to enter Egypt fleeing poverty and war. Border control methods can be harsh, sometimes lethal. This has strained relations with Egypts southern neighbors, and with Israel and the members of the EU as these immigrants attempt to move on to wealthier countries.      Egypt currently occupies the  |Halaib_Triangle|Halaib_Triangle|  of  |Sudan|Sudan| , an area of land located on the  |Red_Sea|Red_Sea|  coast, between the political borders  and the administrative boundary between the two countries.                             |European_Union|European_Union|  relations with Egypt are based on a partnership relation within the Euro – Mediterranean and Middle East area, which is of vital strategic importance and a key external relations priority for the EU.     The  |Euro-Mediterranean_Partnership|Euro-Mediterranean_Partnership|  launched at the 1995 Barcelona Conference between the European Union and its originally 12  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean|  Partners:  |Algeria|Algeria| ,  |Cyprus|Cyprus| ,  |Egypt|Egypt| ,  |Israel|Israel| ,  |Jordan|Jordan| ,  |Lebanon|Lebanon| ,  |Malta|Malta| ,  |Morocco|Morocco| ,  |Syria|Syria| ,  |Tunisia|Tunisia| ,  |Turkey|Turkey| , and the  |Palestinian_Authority|Palestinian_Authority| .  |Libya|Libya|  currently has observer status at certain meetings. Since the enlargement, in May 2004 and January 2007, the co-operation and needs covers 35 countries, the EU of 27, including  |Cyprus|Cyprus|  and  |Malta|Malta|  and the 10 Mediterranean Partners.     Egypt has also taken an active role regarding Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, such as its participation in the technical meeting of which it was the speaker for the Arab group. Additionally, the first meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary assembly was co-chaired by an Egyptian.     Egypt has been one of the leading recipients among the Mediterranean partners in terms of total funds received from the  |MEDA_programme|Meda_Programme| , the principal financial instrument of the European Union for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. It is focused on policy-led, national structural reform and liberalisation programmes with a sector-wide approach.     The EU is Egypts biggest trading partner currently accounting for 42% of Egyptian exports and 37% of imports, with the  |balance_of_trade|Balance_Of_Trade|  still in the EUs favour. Trade between the EU and Egypt has risen by more than 5% in the last five years to reach around 11.6 billion euro in 2004. Egypts main exports to the EU in 2004 were energy , textiles and clothing , agricultural products , and chemicals . Major imports from the EU were power generating machinery , chemicals , transport equipment , and food and agricultural products . Egypt has a serious but improving trade deficit that has put considerable pressure on the  |Egyptian_pound|Egyptian_Pound| .     Trade relations with the EU are good although there are several outstanding trade and phyto-sanitary issues. These range from specific market access issues and difficulties for businesses facing a highly regulated and complex system through to restrictions in the export of agricultural goods and fishery products because they do not conform with EU quality norms.     Egypt is included in the European Unions  |European_Neighbourhood_Policy|European_Neighbourhood_Policy|  which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.     Some time after the starting of the  |Arab_Spring|Arab_Spring| , in March 2011 the  |European_Union|European_Union|  adopted the joint declaration ‘ A partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, aimed at making a number of initiatives in the field of civic society support, financial assistance and further access to the EU market dependent upon advancement in the democratization process.      As far as Egypt was concerned this declaration envisioned the further deepening of the previous Free Trade Agreement stipulated in 2004, geared towards the inclusion of areas such as trade in services, government procurement, competition, intellectual property rights, and investment protection. To the 2011 declaration, a preliminary phase of the negotiations followed in June 2013, when the EU and  |Egypt|Egypt|  began an exploratory dialogue on how to deepen trade and investment relations, in particular through the possible negotiation of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement .      Following the bloody crackdown in August 2014,  |European_Union|European_Union|  discussed the possibility of revising provision of aid to  |Egypt|Egypt| .  However, divisions over the appropriate stance to adopt among European diplomats persisted, coupled by the fear that the vacuum might be soon filled by other actors, following a Saudi Foreign Ministers declaration that the Kingdom was ready to step in  and those of Prime Minister Hazem al Beblawi about the possibility to appeal to Russia for foreign aid.  Therefore, the only measure upon which the Foreign Ministers agreed was to suspend the sale of arms and materials that could be used for repression, but fell short to halt aid program which could damage civil society.     Earlier in July 2013, EU High Representative  |Catherine_Ashton|Catherine_Ashton|  had visited Egypt in an attempt to promote reconciliation among the parties involved. She is credited for being the only foreign diplomat to get access to deposed president Mohamed Morsy.    In an official statement released at the end of a following visit held in April 2014, the Representative raised the issue of the death penalties and incarceration of journalists and activists.  At the same time, her declarations about former general al Sisis bid for candidacy to the presidential elections as “difficult” but “brave”  sparked harsh criticism among supporters of the  |Muslim_Brotherhood|Muslim_Brotherhood| , who claimed the Representative, who advanced logistical reasons, did not make any efforts to get in touch with them and members of the Anti-Coup alliance.      In April 2014 European Union agreed to conduct electoral monitoring, for the first time, in occasion of the Presidential elections scheduled for 26/27 May 2014. Other organizations declined to join, as in their opinion this would legitimize an unlawful take on power.                    Egypt played a key role during the 1990-91  |Persian_Gulf_crisis|Gulf_War| . President Mubarak helped assemble the international coalition and deployed 35,000 Egyptian troops against Iraq to liberate  |Kuwait|Kuwait| . The Egyptian contingent was one of the largest in the coalition forces, along with the U.S.,  |U.K.|United_Kingdom|  and Saudi Arabia.     In the aftermath of the Gulf War, Egypt signed the  |Damascus_Declaration|Damascus_Declaration|  with  |Syria|Syria|  and the Persian Gulf states to strengthen Persian Gulf security. Egypt continues to contribute regularly to  |United_Nations|United_Nations| |peacekeeping|Peacekeeping|  missions, most recently in  |East_Timor|East_Timor| ,  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone| , and  |Liberia|Liberia| .     Following the September 11, 2001  |terrorist_attacks|September_11_Attacks|  on the United States, Egypt, which has itself been the target of terrorist attacks, has been a key supporter of the U.S. war against terrorists and terrorist organizations such as  |Osama_bin_Laden|Osama_Bin_Laden|  and  |al-Qaeda|Al-Qaeda| , and has supported the Iraqi Governing Council.     On December 25, 2006, the Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit called for end to nuclear double standards where sanctions are imposed on  |Iran|Iran|  for enriching uranium, but the  |Israeli_nuclear_program|Israel_And_Weapons_Of_Mass_Destructionnuclear_Weapons|  is not subject to any control by the  |International_Atomic_Energy_Agency|International_Atomic_Energy_Agency| .
