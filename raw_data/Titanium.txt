               Titanium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Ti and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  22. It is a lustrous  |transition_metal|Transition_Metal|  with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to  |corrosion|Corrosion|  in  |sea_water|Sea_Water| ,  |aqua_regia|Aqua_Regia| , and  |chlorine|Chlorine| .     Titanium was discovered in  |Cornwall|Cornwall| ,  |Great_Britain|Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain| , by  |William_Gregor|William_Gregor|  in 1791 and was named by  |Martin_Heinrich_Klaproth|Martin_Heinrich_Klaproth|  after the  |Titans|Titan|  of  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| . The element occurs within a number of  |mineral|Mineral|  deposits, principally  |rutile|Rutile|  and  |ilmenite|Ilmenite| , which are widely distributed in the  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust|  and  |lithosphere|Lithosphere| ; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the  |Kroll|Kroll_Process|  and  |Hunter_process|Hunter_Process| es. The most common compound,  |titanium_dioxide|Titanium_Dioxide| , is a popular  |photocatalyst|Photocatalysis|  and is used in the manufacture of white pigments.  Other compounds include  |titanium_tetrachloride|Titanium_Tetrachloride|  , a component of  |smoke_screens|Smoke_Screen|  and  |catalysts|Catalyst| ; and  |titanium_trichloride|Titanium_Chloride|  , which is used as a catalyst in the production of  |polypropylene|Polypropylene| .     Titanium can be  |alloy|Alloy| ed with  |iron|Iron| ,  |aluminium|Aluminium| ,  |vanadium|Vanadium| , and  |molybdenum|Molybdenum| , among other elements, to produce strong, lightweight alloys for aerospace , military, industrial processes , automotive,  |agriculture|Agriculture|  , medical  |prostheses|Prostheses| , orthopedic  |implants|Implant| , dental and endodontic instruments and files,  |dental_implants|Dental_Implant| , sporting goods, jewelry,  |mobile_phones|Mobile_Phone| , and other applications.     The two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element.  In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some  |steels|Steel| , but less dense.  There are two  |allotropic|Allotropy|  forms  and five naturally occurring  |isotopes|Isotope|  of this element, 46 Ti through 50 Ti, with 48 Ti being the most  |abundant|Natural_Abundance|  .  Although they have the same number of  |valence_electrons|Valence_Electron|  and are in the same  |group|Group|  in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , titanium and  |zirconium|Zirconium|  differ in many chemical and physical properties.           As a  |metal|Metal| , titanium is recognized for its high  |strength-to-weight_ratio|Strength-To-Weight_Ratio| . It is a strong metal with low  |density|Density|  that is quite  |ductile|Ductility|  ,  lustrous, and metallic-white in  |color|Color| . The relatively high melting point makes it useful as a  |refractory_metal|Refractory_Metals| . It is  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism|  and has fairly low  |electrical|Electrical_Conductivity|  and  |thermal_conductivity|Thermal_Conductivity|  compared to other metals. Titanium is  |superconducting|Superconductivity|  when cooled below its critical temperature of 0.49  K.       Commercially pure  |grades|Titanium_Alloygrades_Of_Titanium|  of titanium have  |ultimate_tensile_strength|Ultimate_Tensile_Strength|  of about 434  |MPa|Megapascal|  , equal to that of common, low-grade steel alloys, but are less dense. Titanium is 60% denser than aluminium, but more than twice as strong as the most commonly used  |6061-T6_aluminium_alloy|6061_Aluminium_Alloy| . Certain titanium alloys  achieve tensile strengths of over 1,400 MPa .  However, titanium loses strength when heated above .      Titanium is not as hard as some grades of heat-treated steel; it is non-magnetic and a poor conductor of heat and electricity. Machining requires precautions, because the material can  |gall|Galling|  unless sharp tools and proper cooling methods are used. Like steel structures, those made from titanium have a  |fatigue_limit|Fatigue_Limit|  that guarantees longevity in some applications.     The metal is a dimorphic  |allotrope|Allotropy|  of an hexagonal α form that changes into a body-centered cubic β form at . The  |specific_heat|Specific_Heat_Capacity|  of the α form increases dramatically as it is heated to this transition temperature but then falls and remains fairly constant for the β form regardless of temperature.          Like  |aluminium|Aluminium|  and  |magnesium|Magnesium| , titanium metal and its alloys  |oxidize|Oxidize|  immediately upon exposure to air. Titanium readily reacts with oxygen at  in air, and at  in pure oxygen, forming  |titanium_dioxide|Titanium_Dioxide| . It is, however, slow to react with water and air at ambient temperatures because it forms a  |passive|Passivation|  oxide coating that protects the bulk metal from further oxidation. When it first forms, this protective layer is only 1–2  |nm|Nanometre|  thick but continues to grow slowly; reaching a thickness of 25  nm in four years.     Atmospheric passivation gives titanium excellent resistance to corrosion, almost equivalent to  |platinum|Platinum| . Titanium is capable of withstanding attack by dilute  |sulfuric|Sulfuric_Acid|  and  |hydrochloric_acids|Hydrochloric_Acid| , chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids.  As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.     Titanium is one of the few elements that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at  to form  |titanium_nitride|Titanium_Nitride| , which causes embrittlement.  Because of its high reactivity with oxygen, nitrogen, and some other gases, titanium  |filaments|Electrical_Filament|  are applied in  |titanium_sublimation_pumps|Titanium_Sublimation_Pump|  as scavengers for these gases. Such pumps inexpensively and reliably produce extremely low pressures in  |ultra-high_vacuum|Ultra-High_Vacuum|  systems.            Titanium is the ninth-most  |abundant|Abundance_Of_Elements_In_Earths_Crust|  element in  |Earths|Earth|  crust  and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present as oxides in most  |igneous_rocks|Igneous_Rock| , in  |sediments|Sedimentary_Rock|  derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water.  Of the 801 types of igneous rocks analyzed by the  |United_States_Geological_Survey|United_States_Geological_Survey| , 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.     Common titanium-containing  |minerals|Mineral|  are  |anatase|Anatase| ,  |brookite|Brookite| ,  |ilmenite|Ilmenite| ,  |perovskite|Perovskite| ,  |rutile|Rutile| , and  |titanite|Titanite|  .   |Akaogiite|Akaogiite|  is an extremely rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western  |Australia|Australia| ,  |Canada|Canada| ,  |China|China| ,  |India|India| ,  |Mozambique|Mozambique| ,  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand| ,  |Norway|Norway| ,  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone| ,  |South_Africa|South_Africa| , and  |Ukraine|Ukraine| . About 186,000 tonnes of titanium  |metal_sponge|Metal_Sponge|  were produced in 2011, mostly in China , Japan , Russia , United States and Kazakhstan . Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.     The concentration of titanium is about 4 picomolar in the ocean. At 100  °C, the concentration of titanium in water is estimated to be less than 10 −7 M at pH 7. The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium.      Titanium is contained in  |meteorites|Meteorite| , and it has been detected in the  |Sun|Sun|  and in  |M-type|Stellar_Classification| |stars|Star|  with a surface temperature of .   |Rocks|Rock|  brought back from the  |Moon|Moon|  during the  |Apollo_17|Apollo_17|  mission are composed of 12.1% TiO 2 . It is also found in  |coal|Coal|  ash,  |plants|Plant| , and even the  |human|Human|  body. Native titanium is very rare. . Mindat          Naturally occurring titanium is composed of five stable  |isotopes|Isotope| : 46 Ti, 47 Ti, 48 Ti, 49 Ti, and 50 Ti, with 48 Ti being the most abundant . At least 21  |radioisotopes|Radioisotope|  have been characterized, the most stable of which are  |44_Ti|Titanium-44|  with a  |half-life|Half-Life|  of 63 years; 45 Ti, 184.8 minutes; 51 Ti, 5.76 minutes; and 52 Ti, 1.7 minutes. All other  |radioactive|Radioactive|  isotopes have half-lives less than 33 seconds, with the majority less than half a second.     The isotopes of titanium range in  |atomic_weight|Atomic_Weight|  from 39.002  |u|Unified_Atomic_Mass_Unit|  to 63.999 u . The primary  |decay_mode|Decay_Mode|  for isotopes lighter than 46 Ti is  |positron_emission|Positron_Emission|  , leading to  |isotopes_of_scandium|Isotopes_Of_Scandium| , and the primary mode for isotopes heavier than 50 Ti is  |beta_emission|Beta_Emission| , leading to  |isotopes_of_vanadium|Isotopes_Of_Vanadium| .     Titanium becomes radioactive upon bombardment with  |deuterons|Deuterons| , emitting mainly  |positrons|Positrons|  and hard  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Rays| .             The +4  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  dominates titanium chemistry,  but compounds in the +3  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  are also common.  Commonly, titanium adopts an  |octahedral_coordination_geometry|Octahedral_Coordination_Geometry|  in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl 4 is a notable exception. Because of its high oxidation state, titanium compounds exhibit a high degree of  |covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond| ing. Unlike most other transition metals, simple  |aquo_Ti_complexes|Transition_Metal_Aquo_Complex|  are unknown.       The most important oxide is TiO 2 , which exists in three important  |polymorphs|Polymorphism| ;  |anatase|Anatase| ,  |brookite|Brookite| , and  |rutile|Rutile| . All of these are white diamagnetic solids, although mineral samples can appear dark . They adopt polymeric structures in which Ti is surrounded by six  |oxide|Oxide|  ligands that link to other Ti centers.     The term  titanate s usually refers to titanium compounds, as represented by  |barium_titanate|Barium_Titanate|  . With a  |perovskite|Perovskite|  structure, this material exhibits  |piezoelectric|Piezoelectric|  properties and is used as a transducer in the interconversion of  |sound|Sound|  and  |electricity|Electricity| . Many minerals are titanates, e.g.  |ilmenite|Ilmenite|  .  |Star_sapphires|Star_Sapphire|  and  |rubies|Ruby|  get their  |asterism|Asterism|  from the presence of titanium dioxide impurities.     A variety of reduced oxides  of titanium are known, mainly reduced  |stoichiometries|Stoichiometry|  of  |titanium_dioxide|Titanium_Dioxide|  obtained by  |atmospheric_plasma_spraying|Atmospheric_Plasma_Spraying| . Ti 3 O 5 , described as a Ti-Ti species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO 2 with hydrogen at high temperatures,  and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapour-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas TiO 2 evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index.  Also known is  |Ti_2_O_3|Titanium_Oxide| , with the  |corundum|Corundum|  structure, and  |TiO|Titanium_Oxide| , with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.      The  |alkoxides|Alkoxide|  of titanium, prepared by reacting TiCl 4 with alcohols, are colourless compounds that convert to the dioxide on reaction with water. They are industrially useful for depositing solid TiO 2 via the  |sol-gel_process|Sol-Gel_Process| .  |Titanium_isopropoxide|Titanium_Isopropoxide|  is used in the synthesis of chiral organic compounds via the  |Sharpless_epoxidation|Sharpless_Epoxidation| .     Titanium forms a variety of sulfides, but only  |TiS_2|Titanium_Disulfide|  has attracted significant interest. It adopts a layered structure and was used as a cathode in the development of  |lithium_batteries|Lithium_Batteries| . Because Ti is a  |hard_cation|Hsab_Theory| , the sulfides of titanium are unstable and tend to hydrolyze to the oxide with release of hydrogen sulfide.        |Titanium_nitride|Titanium_Nitride|  is a member of a family of refractory transition metal nitrides and exhibits properties similar to both covalent compounds including; thermodynamic stability, extreme hardness, thermal/electrical conductivity, and a high melting point.  TiN has a hardness equivalent to  |sapphire|Sapphire|  and  |carborundum|Carborundum|  ,  and is often used to coat cutting tools, such as  |drill_bits|Drill_Bit| .  It is also used as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a  |barrier_metal|Copper-Based_Chipsbarrier_Metal|  in  |semiconductor_fabrication|Semiconductor_Fabrication| .   |Titanium_carbide|Titanium_Carbide| , which is also very hard, is found in cutting tools and coatings.              |Titanium_tetrachloride|Titanium_Tetrachloride|   is a colorless volatile liquid that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the  |Kroll_process|Kroll_Process| , TiCl 4 is produced in the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint.  It is widely used in  |organic_chemistry|Organic_Chemistry|  as a  |Lewis_acid|Lewis_Acids_And_Bases| , for example in the  |Mukaiyama_aldol_condensation|Mukaiyama_Aldol_Condensation| .  In the  |van_Arkel_process|Van_Arkel_Process| ,  |titanium_tetraiodide|Titanium_Tetraiodide|  is generated in the production of high purity titanium metal.     Titanium and titanium also form stable chlorides. A notable example is  |titanium_chloride|Titanium_Chloride|  , which is used as a  |catalyst|Catalyst|  for production of  |polyolefins|Polyolefin|   and a reducing  |agent|Reagent|  in organic chemistry.          Owing to the important role of titanium compounds as  |polymerization|Polymerization|  catalyst, compounds with Ti-C bonds have been intensively studied. The most common organotitanium complex is  |titanocene_dichloride|Titanocene_Dichloride|  . Related compounds include  |Tebbes_reagent|Tebbes_Reagent|  and  |Petasis_reagent|Petasis_Reagent| . Titanium forms  |carbonyl_complexes|Metal_Carbonyl| , e.g.  |2_Ti_2|Titanocene_Dicarbonyl| .  |Hartwig,_J._F.|John_F._Hartwig|  Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis. University Science Books: New York.        Following the success of  |platinum-based|Cisplatin|  chemotherapy, titanium complexes were among the first non-platinum compounds to be tested for cancer treatment. The advantage of titanium compounds lies in their high efficacy and low toxicity. In biological environments, hydrolysis leads to the safe and inert titanium dioxide. Despite these advantages the first candidate compounds failed clinical trials. Further development resulted in the creation of potentially effective, selective, and stable titanium-based drugs.  Their mode of action is not yet well understood.            Titanium was  |discovered|Discovery_Of_The_Chemical_Elements|  in 1791 by the  |clergy|Clergy| man and amateur geologist  |William_Gregor|William_Gregor|  as an  |inclusion|Inclusion|  of a  |mineral|Mineral|  in  |Cornwall|Cornwall| , Great Britain. Gregor recognized the presence of a new element in  |ilmenite|Ilmenite|  when he found black sand by a stream and noticed the sand was attracted by a  |magnet|Magnet| . Analyzing the sand, he determined the presence of two metal oxides:  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide|  and 45.25% of a white metallic oxide he could not identify.  Realizing that the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known element, Gregor reported his findings to the  |Royal_Geological_Society_of_Cornwall|Royal_Geological_Society_Of_Cornwall|  and in the German science journal  Crells Annalen .
