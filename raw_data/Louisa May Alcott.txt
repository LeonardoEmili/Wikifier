          Louisa May Alcott  was an American novelist, short story writer and poet best known as the author of the novel  Little Women  and its sequels  Little Men  and  Jos Boys  . Raised in New England by her  |transcendentalist|Transcendentalist|  parents,  |Abigail_May|Abigail_May|  and  |Amos_Bronson_Alcott|Amos_Bronson_Alcott| , she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day, such as  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson| ,  |Nathaniel_Hawthorne|Nathaniel_Hawthorne| ,  |Henry_David_Thoreau|Henry_David_Thoreau| , and  |Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow|Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow| .     Alcotts family suffered from financial difficulties, and while she worked to help support the family from an early age, she also sought an outlet in writing. She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s. Early in her career, she sometimes used the pen name A. M. Barnard, under which she wrote novels for young adults that focused on spies and revenge.     Published in 1868,  Little Women  is set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in  |Concord,_Massachusetts|Concord,_Massachusetts| , and is loosely based on Alcotts childhood experiences with her three sisters,  |Abigail_May_Alcott_Nieriker|Abigail_May_Alcott_Nieriker| ,  |Elizabeth_Sewall_Alcott|Elizabeth_Sewall_Alcott| , and  |Anna_Alcott_Pratt|Anna_Alcott_Pratt| . The novel was well-received at the time and is still a popular  |childrens_novel|Childrens_Novel|  today. It has been adapted to film several times.     Alcott was an  |abolitionist|Abolitionism_In_The_United_States|  and a  |feminist|Feminism|  and remained unmarried throughout her life. She died from a stroke, two days after her father died, in Boston on March 6, 1888.       Louisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832,  in  |Germantown|Germantown,_Philadelphia| , which is now part of  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia| ,  |Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania| , on her fathers 33rd birthday. She was the daughter of  |transcendentalist|Transcendentalism|  and educator  |Amos_Bronson_Alcott|Amos_Bronson_Alcott|  and social worker  |Abby_May|Abby_May|  and the second of four daughters:  |Anna_Bronson_Alcott|Anna_Alcott_Pratt|  was the eldest;  |Elizabeth_Sewall_Alcott|Elizabeth_Sewall_Alcott|  and  |Abigail_May_Alcott|May_Alcott_Nieriker|  were the two youngest. The family moved to Boston in 1834,  where Alcotts father established an experimental school and joined the  |Transcendental_Club|Transcendental_Club|  with  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|  and  |Henry_David_Thoreau|Henry_David_Thoreau| . Bronson Alcotts opinions on education and tough views on child-rearing as well as his moments of mental instability shaped young Alcotts mind with a desire to achieve perfection, a goal of the transcendentalists.  His attitudes towards Alcotts wild and independent behavior, and his inability to provide for his family, created conflict between Bronson Alcott and his wife and daughters.  Abigail resented her husbands inability to recognize her sacrifices and related his thoughtlessness to the larger issue of the inequality of sexes. She passed this recognition and desire to redress wrongs done to women on to Louisa.      In 1840, after several setbacks with the school, the Alcott family moved to a cottage on  of land, situated along the  |Sudbury_River|Sudbury_River|  in  |Concord,_Massachusetts|Concord,_Massachusetts| . The three years they spent at the rented Hosmer Cottage were described as idyllic.  By 1843, the Alcott family moved, along with six other members of the Consociate Family, to the  |Utopia|Utopia| n  |Fruitlands|Fruitlands|  community for a brief interval in 1843–1844. After the collapse of the Utopian Fruitlands, they moved on to rented rooms and finally, with Abigail May Alcotts inheritance and financial help from Emerson, they purchased a homestead in  |Concord|Concord,_Massachusetts| . They moved into the home they named  |Hillside|The_Wayside|  on April 1, 1845, but moved in 1852, selling to Nathaniel Hawthorne who renamed it The Wayside. Moving 22 times in 30 years, the Alcotts returned to Concord once again in 1857 and moved into  |Orchard_House|Orchard_House| , a two-story clapboard farmhouse, in the spring of 1858.        Alcotts early education included lessons from the  |naturalist|Naturalist| |Henry_David_Thoreau|Henry_David_Thoreau|  who inspired her to write Thoreaus Flute based on her time at Waldens Pond. Most of the education she received though, came from her father who was strict and believed in the sweetness of self-denial. She also received some instruction from writers and educators such as  |Ralph_Waldo_Emerson|Ralph_Waldo_Emerson| ,  |Nathaniel_Hawthorne|Nathaniel_Hawthorne| ,  |Margaret_Fuller|Margaret_Fuller| , and  |Julia_Ward_Howe|Julia_Ward_Howe| , all of whom were family friends. She later described these early years in a newspaper sketch entitled Transcendental Wild Oats. The sketch was reprinted in the volume Silver Pitchers , which relates the familys experiment in plain living and high thinking at Fruitlands.      Poverty made it necessary for Alcott to go to work at an early age as a teacher,  |seamstress|Seamstress| ,  |governess|Governess| , domestic helper, and writer. Her sisters also supported the family, working as seamstresses, while their mother took on social work among the  |Irish_immigrants|Irish_Immigrants| . Only the youngest, May, was able to attend public school. Due to all of these pressures, writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Alcott. Her first book was  Flower Fables  , a selection of tales originally written for Ellen Emerson, daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Alcott is quoted as saying I wish I was rich, I was good, and we were all a happy family this day  and was driven in life not to be poor.     In 1847, she and her family served as  |station_masters|Safe_House|  on the  |Underground_Railroad|Underground_Railroad| , when they housed a  |fugitive_slave|Fugitive_Slave|  for one week and had discussions with  |Frederick_Douglass|Frederick_Douglass| .  Alcott read and admired the  |Declaration_of_Sentiments|Declaration_Of_Sentiments|  , published by the  |Seneca_Falls_Convention|Seneca_Falls_Convention|  on  |womens_rights|Womens_Rights| , advocating for  |womens_suffrage|Womens_Suffrage|  and became the first woman to register to vote in  |Concord,_Massachusetts|Concord,_Massachusetts|  in a school board election.  The 1850s were hard times for the Alcotts, and in 1854 Louisa found solace at the  |Boston_Theatre|The_Boston_Theatre|  where she wrote The Rival Prima Donnas, which she later burned due to a quarrel between the actresses on who would play what role. At one point in 1857, unable to find work and filled with such despair, Alcott contemplated suicide. During that year, she read  |Elizabeth_Gaskells|Elizabeth_Gaskell|  biography of  |Charlotte_Brontë|Charlotte_Brontë|  and found many parallels to her own life. In 1858, her younger sister Elizabeth died, and her older sister Anna married a man named John Pratt. This felt, to Alcott, to be a breaking up of their sisterhood.          As an adult, Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist. In 1860, Alcott began writing for the  Atlantic Monthly . When the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War|  broke out, she served as a nurse in the Union Hospital at  |Georgetown|Georgetown| ,  |DC|District_Of_Columbia| , for six weeks in 1862–1863. She intended to serve three months as a nurse, but halfway through she contracted typhoid and became deathly ill, though she eventually recovered. Her letters homerevised and published in the Boston anti-slavery paper Commonwealth and collected as  Hospital Sketches  brought her first critical recognition for her observations and humor.  She wrote about the mismanagement of hospitals and the indifference and callousness of some of the surgeons she encountered. Her main character, Tribulation Periwinkle, showed a passage from innocence to maturity and is a serious and eloquent witness . Her novel Moods , based on her own experience, was also promising.
