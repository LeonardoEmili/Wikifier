     The history of Asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as  |East_Asia|East_Asia| ,  |South_Asia|South_Asia| ,  |Southeast_Asia|History_Of_Southeast_Asia|  and the  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian  |steppe|Steppe| .     The coastal periphery was the home to some of the worlds earliest known civilizations and religions, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops. The civilizations in  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| ,  |India|India| , and  |China|China|  shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.     The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of  |Siberia|Siberia|  was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the  |tundra|Tundra| . These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.     The centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts. The  |Caucasus|Caucasus_Mountains| ,  |Himalaya|Himalayas| ,  |Karakum_Desert|Karakum_Desert| , and  |Gobi_Desert|Gobi_Desert|  formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty. While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force. Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.     Asias history features major developments seen in other parts of the world, as well as events that have affected those other regions. These include the trade of the  |Silk_Road|Silk_Road| , which spread cultures, languages, religions, and diseases throughout Afro-Eurasian trade. Another major advancement was the innovation of  |gunpowder|Gunpowder|  in medieval China, later developed by the  |Islamic_gunpowder_empires|Gunpowder_Empires| , mainly by the  |Mughals|Mughal_Tribe|  and  |Safavids|Safavid| , which led to advanced warfare through the use of guns.               A report by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari on Lahuradewa,  |India|India|  shows new C14 datings that range between 9000 and 8000 BCE associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site in entire South Asia.        The  |prehistoric_Beifudi_site|Prehistoric_Beifudi_Site|  near Yixian in  |Hebei|Hebei|  Province, China, contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the  |Cishan|Cishan_Culture|  and  |Xinglongwa|Xinglongwa_Culture|  cultures of about 8000–7000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the  |Taihang_Mountains|Taihang_Mountains| , filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square meters and the collection of neolithic findings at the site consists of two phases.        Around 5500 BCE the  |Halafian|Tel_Halaf|  culture appeared in  |Lebanon|Lebanon| ,  |Israel|Land_Of_Israel| ,  |Syria|Syria| ,  |Anatolia|Anatolia| , and northern  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia| , based upon dryland agriculture.     In southern Mesopotamia were the alluvial plains of  |Sumer|Sumer|  and  |Elam|Elam| . Since there was little rainfall,  |irrigation|Irrigation|  systems were necessary. The  |Ubaid|Ubaid_Period|  culture flourished from 5500 BCE.               The  |Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic|  period began about 4500 BCE, then the  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  began about 3500 BCE, replacing the Neolithic cultures.     The  |Indus_Valley_Civilization|Indus_Valley_Civilization|  was a Bronze Age civilization which was centered mostly in the western part of the Indian Subcontinent; it is considered that an early form of Hinduism was performed during this civilization. Some of the great cities of this civilization include  |Harappa|Harappa|  and  |Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo-Daro| , which had a high level of town planning and arts. The cause of the destruction of these regions around 1700 BCE is debatable, although evidence suggests it was caused by natural disasters .  This era marks  |Vedic_period|Vedic_Period|  in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BCE. During this period, the  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit|  language developed and the  |Vedas|Vedas|  were written, epic hymns that told tales of gods and wars. This was the basis for the Vedic religion, which would eventually sophisticate and develop into  |Hinduism|Hinduism| .     China and  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  were also centres of metalworking. Dating back to the Neolithic Age, the first bronze drums, called the Dong Son drums have been uncovered in and around the Red River Delta regions of Vietnam and Southern China. These relate to the prehistoric Dong Son Culture of Vietnam.   Song Da bronze drums surface, Dong Son culture, Vietnam     In Ban Chiang, Thailand , bronze artifacts have been discovered dating to 2100 BCE.     In Nyaunggan, Burma bronze tools have been excavated along with ceramics and stone artifacts. Dating is still currently broad .                  The Iron Age saw the widespread use of iron tools, weaponry, and armor throughout the major civilizations of Asia.          The  |Achaemenid_dynasty|Achaemenid_Empire|  of the  |Persian_Empire|Achaemenid_Empire| , founded by  |Cyrus_the_Great|Cyrus_The_Great| , ruled an area from  |Greece|Greece|  and  |Turkey|Turkey|  to the  |Indus_River|Indus_River|  and Central Asia during the 6th to 4th centuries BCE. Persian politics included a tolerance for other cultures, a highly  |centralized_government|Centralized_Government| , and significant infrastructure developments. Later, in  |Darius_the_Greats|Darius_I|  rule, the territories were integrated, a bureaucracy was developed, nobility were assigned military positions, tax collection was carefully organized, and spies were used to ensure the loyalty of regional officials. The primary religion of Persia at this time was  |Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrianism| , developed by the philosopher  |Zoroaster|Zoroaster| . It introduced an early form of  |monotheism|Monotheism|  to the area. The religion banned animal sacrifice and the use of intoxicants in rituals; and introduced the concept of spiritual salvation through personal moral action, an  |end_time|End_Time| , and both  |general|General_Judgment|  and  |Particular_judgment|Particular_Judgment|  with a  |heaven|Heaven|  or  |hell|Hell| . These concepts would heavily influence later emperors and the masses. More importantly, Zoroastrianism would be an important precursor for the  |Abrahamic_religions|Abrahamic_Religions|  such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Persian Empire was successful in establishing peace and stability throughout the Middle East and were a major influence in art, politics , and religion.      |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  conquered this dynasty in the 4th century BCE, creating the brief  |Hellenistic_period|Hellenistic_Period| . He was unable to establish stability and after his death, Persia broke into small, weak dynasties including the  |Seleucid_Empire|Seleucid_Empire| , followed by the  |Parthian_Empire|Parthian_Empire| . By the end of the Classical age, Persia had been reconsolidated into the  |Sassanid_Empire|Sassanid_Empire| , also known as the second Persian Empire.     The  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  would later control parts of Western Asia. The  |Seleucid|Seleucid| ,  |Parthian|Parthian_Empire|  and  |Sassanid|Sassanid|  dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.            The Maurya and Gupta empires are called the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture. The religions of  |Hinduism|Hinduism|  and  |Buddhism|Buddhism| , which began in Indian sub-continent, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia.        By 600 BCE, India had been divided into 17 regional states that would occasionally feud amongst themselves. In 327 BCE,  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great|  came to India with a vision of conquering the whole world. He crossed northwestern India and created the province  |Bactria|Bactria|  but could not move further because his army wanted to go back to their family. Shortly prior, the soldier  |Chandragupta_Maurya|Chandragupta_Maurya|  began to take control of the Ganges river and soon established the  |Maurya_Empire|Maurya_Empire| . The Maurya Empire was the geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE. It was one of the worlds largest empires in its time, stretching to the  |Himalayas|Himalayas|  in the north, what is now  |Assam|Assam|  in the east, probably beyond modern  |Pakistan|Pakistan|  in the west, and annexing  |Balochistan|Balochistan|  and much of what is now  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| , at its greatest extent. South of Mauryan empire was the  |Tamilakam|Tamilakam|  an independent country dominated by three dynasties, the  |Pandyans|Pandya_Dynasty| ,  |Cholas|Cholas|  and  |Cheras|Cheras| . The government established by Chandragupta was led by an autocratic king, who primarily relied on the military to assert his power. It also applied the use of a bureaucracy and even sponsored a postal service. Chandraguptas grandson,  |Ashoka|Ashoka| , greatly extended the empire by conquering most of modern-day India . He eventually converted to Buddhism, though, and began a peaceful life where he promoted the religion as well as humane methods throughout India. The Maurya Empire would disintegrate soon after Ashokas death and was conquered by the Kushan invaders from the northwest, establishing the  |Kushan_Empire|Kushan_Empire| . Their conversion to Buddhism caused the religion to be associated with foreigners and therefore a decline in its popularity occurred.     The Kushan Empire would fall apart by 220 CE, creating more political turmoil in India. Then in 320, the  |Gupta_Empire|Gupta_Empire|  was established and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by  |Maharaja_Sri-Gupta|Maharaja_Sri-Gupta| , the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization. Gupta kings united the area primarily through negotiation of local leaders and families as well as strategical intermarriage. Their rule covered less land than the Maurya Empire, but established the greatest stability. In 535, the empire ended when India was overrun by the  |Hunas|Hunas| .               Since 1029 BCE, the  |Zhou_dynasty|Zhou_Dynasty|  , had existed in China and it would continue to until 258 BCE. The Zhou dynasty had been using a  |feudal_system|Feudalism|  by giving power to local nobility and relying on their loyalty in order to control its large territory. As a result, the Chinese government at this time tended to be very decentralized and weak, and there was often little the emperor could do to resolve national issues. Nonetheless, the government was able to retain its position with the creation of the  |Mandate_of_Heaven|Mandate_Of_Heaven| , which could establish an emperor as divinely chosen to rule. The Zhou additionally discouraged the  |human_sacrifice|Human_Sacrifice|  of the preceding eras and unified the  |Chinese_language|Chinese_Language| . Finally, the Zhou government encouraged settlers to move into the  |Yangtze_River|Yangtze|  valley, thus creating the Chinese Middle Kingdom.     But by 500 BCE, its political stability began to decline due to repeated nomadic incursions and internal conflict derived from the fighting princes and families. This was lessened by the many philosophical movements, starting with the life of  |Confucius|Confucius| . His philosophical writings  concerning the respect of elders and of the state would later be popularly used in the Han dynasty. Additionally,  |Laozis|Laozi|  concepts of  |Taoism|Taoism| , including  |yin_and_yang|Yin_And_Yang|  and the innate duality and balance of nature and the universe, became popular throughout this period. Nevertheless, the Zhou Dynasty eventually disintegrated as the local nobles began to gain more power and their conflict devolved into the  |Warring_States_period|Warring_States_Period| , from 402 to 201 BCE.        One leader eventually came on top,  |Qin_Shi_Huang|Qin_Shi_Huang|  , who overthrew the last Zhou emperor and established the Qin dynasty. The  |Qin_dynasty|Qin_Dynasty|  was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 207 BCE. The new Emperor abolished the feudal system and directly appointed a bureaucracy that would rely on him for power. Huangs imperial forces crushed any regional resistance, and they furthered the Chinese empire by expanding down to the  |South_China_Sea|South_China_Sea|  and northern  |Vietnam|Vietnam| . Greater organization brought a uniform tax system, a national census, regulated road building , standard measurements, standard coinage, and an official written and spoken language. Further reforms included new irrigation projects, the encouragement of  |silk|Silk|  manufacturing, and the beginning of the construction of the Great Wall of China—designed to keep out the nomadic raiders whod constantly badger the Chinese people. However, Shi Huang was infamous for his tyranny, forcing laborers to build the Wall, ordering heavy taxes, and severely punishing all who opposed him. He oppressed Confucians and promoted  |Legalism|Legalism| , the idea that people were inherently evil, and that a strong, forceful government was needed to control them. Legalism was infused with realistic, logical views and rejected the pleasures of educated conversation as frivolous. All of this made Shi Huang extremely unpopular with the people. As the Qin began to weaken, various factions began to fight for control of China.           The  |Han_dynasty|Han_Dynasty|  was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms . Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history. One of the Han dynastys greatest emperors,  |Emperor_Wu_of_Han|Emperor_Wu_Of_Han| , established a peace throughout China comparable to the  |Pax_Romana|Pax_Romana|  seen in the Mediterranean a hundred years later. To this day, Chinas majority ethnic group refers to itself as the Han people . The Han Dynasty was established when two peasants succeeded in rising up against Shi Huangs significantly weaker successor-son. The new Han government retained the centralization and bureaucracy of the Qin, but greatly reduced the repression seen before. They expanded their territory into  |Korea|Korea| ,  |Vietnam|Vietnam| , and  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| , creating an even larger empire than the Qin.     The Han developed contacts with the Persian Empire in the Middle East and the Romans, through the  |Silk_Road|Silk_Road| , with which they were able to trade many commodities—primarily silk. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the  |Silk_Road|Silk_Road| , which connected China,  |India|India| , the Middle East and Europe. Han emperors like Wu also promoted Confucianism as the national religion . Shrines devoted to Confucius were built and Confucian philosophy was taught to all scholars who entered the Chinese bureaucracy. The bureaucracy was further improved with the introduction of an examination system that selected scholars of high merit. These bureaucrats were often upper-class people educated in special schools, but whose power was often checked by the lower-class brought into the bureaucracy through their skill. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was very effective and highly respected by all in the realm and would last over 2,000 years. The Han government was highly organized and it commanded the military, judicial law , agricultural production, the economy, and the general lives of its people. The government also promoted intellectual philosophy, scientific research, and detailed historical records.     However, despite all of this impressive stability, central power began to lose control by the turn of the  |Common_Era|Common_Era| . As the Han Dynasty declined, many factors continued to pummel it into submission until China was left in a state of chaos. By 100 CE, philosophical activity slowed, and corruption ran rampant in the bureaucracy. Local landlords began to take control as the scholars neglected their duties, and this resulted in heavy taxation of the peasantry. Taoists began to gain significant ground and protested the decline. They started to proclaim magical powers and promised to save China with them; the Taoist  |Yellow_Turban_Rebellion|Yellow_Turban_Rebellion|  in 184 failed but was able to weaken the government. The aforementioned Huns combined with diseases killed up to half of the population and officially ended the Han dynasty by 220. The ensuing period of chaos was so terrible it lasted for three centuries, where many weak regional rulers and dynasties failed to establish order in China. This period of chaos and attempts at order is commonly known as that of the  |Six_Dynasties|Six_Dynasties| . The first part of this included the  |Three_Kingdoms|Three_Kingdoms|  which started in 220 and describes the brief and weak successor dynasties that followed the Han. In 265, the  |Jin_dynasty|Jin_Dynasty|  of China was started and this soon split into two different empires in control of northwestern and southeastern China. In 420, the conquest and abdication of those two dynasties resulted in the first of the  |Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties|Southern_And_Northern_Dynasties| . The Northern and Southern Dynasties passed through until finally, by 557, the  |Northern_Zhou_dynasty|Northern_Zhou|  ruled the north and the  |Chen_dynasty|Chen_Dynasty|  ruled the south.      |Eastern_world|Eastern_World|  empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.             The Arabian peninsula and the surrounding  |Middle_East|Middle_East|  and  |Near_East|Near_East|  regions saw dramatic change during the Medieval era caused primarily by the spread of  |Islam|Islam|  and the establishment of the Arabian Empires.     In the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the  |Sassanian_Empire|Sassanian_Empire|  of the  |Persians|History_Of_Iran|  in what is now  |Iran|Iran|  and  |Iraq|Iraq| , and the Byzantine Empire in  |Anatolia|Anatolia|  . The Byzantines and Sassanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic  |Bedouin|Bedouin|  tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.     While the  |Byzantine|Byzantine_Empire|  Roman and  |Sassanid|Sassanian_Empire|  Persian empires were both weakened by the  |Byzantine–Sasanian_War_of_602–628|Byzantine–Sasanian_War_Of_602–628| , a new power in the form of  |Islam|Islam|  grew in the Middle East under  |Muhammad_in_Medina|Muhammad_In_Medina| . In a series of rapid  |Muslim_conquests|Muslim_Conquests| , the  |Rashidun_army|Rashidun_Army| , led by the  |Caliphs|Caliph|  and skilled military commanders such as  |Khalid_ibn_al-Walid|Khalid_Ibn_Al-Walid| , swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the  |Arab–Byzantine_wars|Arab–Byzantine_Wars|  and completely engulfing Persia in the  |Muslim_conquest_of_Persia|Muslim_Conquest_Of_Persia| . It would be the Arab  |Caliphates|Caliphate|  of the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant  |ethnic_identity|Arab|  that persists today. These Caliphates included the  |Rashidun_Caliphate|Rashidun_Caliphate| ,  |Umayyad_Caliphate|Umayyad_Caliphate| ,  |Abbasid_Caliphate|Abbasid_Caliphate| , and later the  |Seljuq_Empire|Seljuq_Empire| .        After Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an  |Islamic_Golden_Age|Islamic_Golden_Age| , inspiring achievements in  |architecture|Architecture| , the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in  |medicine|History_Of_Medicine| ,  |algebra|History_Of_Elementary_Algebra| ,  |geometry|History_Of_Geometry| ,  |astronomy|History_Of_Astronomy| ,  |anatomy|History_Of_Anatomy| , and  |ethics|History_Of_Ethics|  that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.     The dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the  |Seljuq_Turks|Seljuq_Turks| , migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq , Syria, Palestine, and the  |Hejaz|Hejaz| . This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire| , to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade|  captured  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  and founded the  |Kingdom_of_Jerusalem|Kingdom_Of_Jerusalem| , which survived until 1187, when  |Saladin|Saladin|  retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the  |Mongol_Empire|Mongol_Empire| , swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the  |Siege_of_Baghdad|Siege_Of_Baghdad|  and advancing as far south as the border of  |Egypt|Egypt|  in what became known as the  |Mongol_conquests|Mongol_Conquests| . The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol,  |Timur|Timur| , and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the  |Ottomans|Ottoman_Turks| .                 The  |Mongol_Empire|Mongol_Empire|  conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as  |Genghis_Khan|Genghis_Khan| . He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.                 The Indian early medieval age, 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When  |Harsha|Harsha|  of  |Kannauj|Kannauj| , who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the  |Chalukya|Chalukya_Dynasty|  ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the  |Pala|Pala_Empire|  king of  |Bengal|Bengal| . When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the  |Pallavas|Pallava|  from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the  |Pandyas|Pandyas|  and the  |Cholas|Cholas|  from still farther south. The Cholas could under the rule of  |Raja_Raja_Chola|Raja_Raja_Chola|  defeat their rivals and rise to a regional power. Cholas expanded northward and defeated  |Eastern_Chalukya|Eastern_Chalukya| ,  |Kalinga|Eastern_Ganga_Dynasty|  and the  |Pala|Pala_Empire| . Under  |Rajendra_Chola|Rajendra_Chola|  the Cholas created the first notable navy of Indian subcontinent. The  |Chola_navy|Chola_Navy|  extended the influence of Chola empire to  |southeast_asia|Southeast_Asia| . During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.      The  |Muslim_conquest_in_the_Indian_subcontinent|Muslim_Conquest_In_The_Indian_Subcontinent|  mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests include the limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Umayyad campaigns in India, during the time of the Rajput kingdoms in the 8th century.     Major economic and military powers like the  |Delhi_Sultanate|Delhi_Sultanate|  and  |Bengal_Sultanate|Bengal_Sultanate| , were seen to be established. The  |Mughal_Empire|Mughal_Empire| , one of the  |Gunpowder_Empires|Gunpowder_Empires| , conquered most of the  |South_Asia|South_Asia| , and during emperor  |Shah_Jahan|Shah_Jahan|  and his son  |Aurangzebs|Aurangzeb|  Islamic  |sharia|Sharia|  reign, the empire reached its architectural and economic zenith, and became the worlds largest economy,  |Maddison,_Angus|Angus_Maddison|  : https://books.google.com/books?idrHJGz3HiJbcC & pgPA259 Development Centre Studies The World Economy Historical Statistics: Historical Statistics,  |OECD_Publishing|Oecd_Publishing| , , pages 259–261 worth over 25% of world GDP and signaled the  |proto-industrialization|Proto-Industrialization| .      Following major events such as the  |Nader_Shahs_invasion_of_the_Mughal_Empire|Nader_Shahs_Invasion_Of_The_Mughal_Empire| ,  |Battle_of_Plassey|Battle_Of_Plassey| ,  |Battle_of_Buxar|Battle_Of_Buxar|  and the long  |Anglo-Mysore_Wars|Anglo-Mysore_Wars| , most of South Asia was colonised and governed by the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| , thus establishing the  |British_Raj|British_Raj| .                 China saw the rise and fall of the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties and therefore improvements in its bureaucracy, the spread of  |Buddhism|Buddhism| , and the advent of  |Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism| . It was an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.        A new powerful dynasty began to rise in the 580s, amongst the divided factions of China. This was started when an aristocrat named Yang Jian married his daughter into the Northern Zhou dynasty. He proclaimed himself  |Emperor_Wen_of_Sui|Emperor_Wen_Of_Sui|  and appeased the nomadic military by abandoning the Confucian scholar-gentry. Emperor Wen soon led the conquest of the southern Chen Dynasty and united China once more under the  |Sui_dynasty|Sui_Dynasty| . The emperor lowered taxes and constructed granaries that he used to prevent famine and control the market. Later Wens son would murder him for the throne and declare himself  |Emperor_Yang_of_Sui|Emperor_Yang_Of_Sui| . Emperor Yang revived the Confucian scholars and the bureaucracy, much to anger of the aristocrats and nomadic military leaders. Yang became an excessive leader who overused Chinas resources for personal luxury and perpetuated exhaustive attempts to reconquer Korea. His military failures and neglect of the empire forced his own ministers to assassinate him in 618, ending the Sui Dynasty.             Fortunately, one of Yangs most respectable advisors, Li Yuan, was able to claim the throne quickly, preventing a chaotic collapse. He proclaimed himself  |Emperor_Gaozu|Emperor_Gaozu_Of_Tang| , and established the  |Tang_dynasty|Tang_Dynasty|  in 623. The Tang saw expansion of China through conquest to Tibet in the west,  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  in the south, and Manchuria in the north. Tang emperors also improved the education of scholars in the Chinese bureaucracy. A Ministry of Rites was established and the examination system was improved to better qualify scholars for their jobs. In addition, Buddhism became popular in China with two different strains between the peasantry and the elite, the  |Pure_Land|Pure_Land_Buddhism|  and  |Zen|Zen|  strains, respectively. Greatly supporting the spread of Buddhism was  |Empress_Wu|Wu_Zetian| , who additionally claimed an unofficial Zhou dynasty and displayed Chinas tolerance of a woman ruler, which was rare at the time. However, Buddhism would also experience some backlash, especially from Confucianists and Taoists. This would usually involve criticism about how it was costing the state money, since the government was unable to tax Buddhist monasteries, and additionally sent many grants and gifts to them.     The Tang dynasty began to decline under the rule of  |Emperor_Xuanzong|Emperor_Xuanzong_Of_Tang| , who began to neglect the economy and military and caused unrest amongst the court officials due to the excessive influence of his concubine,  |Yang_Guifei|Yang_Guifei| , and her family. This eventually sparked a revolt in 755. Although the revolt failed, subduing it required involvement with the unruly nomadic tribes outside of China and distributing more power to local leaders—leaving the government and economy in a degraded state. The Tang dynasty officially ended in 907 and various factions led by the aforementioned nomadic tribes and local leaders would fight for control of China in the  |Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_period|Five_Dynasties_And_Ten_Kingdoms_Period| .        By 960, most of China proper had been reunited under the  |Song_dynasty|Song_Dynasty| , although it lost territories in the north and could not defeat one of the nomadic tribes there—the  |Liao_dynasty|Liao_Dynasty|  of the highly sinicized  |Khitan_people|Khitan_People| . From then on, the Song would have to pay tribute to avoid invasion and thus set the precedent for other nomadic kingdoms to oppress them. The Song also saw the revival of Confucianism in the form of  |Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism| . This had the effect of putting the Confucian scholars at a higher status than aristocrats or Buddhists and also intensified the reduction of power in women. The infamous practice of  |foot_binding|Foot_Binding|  developed in this period as a result. Eventually the Liao dynasty in the north was overthrown by the  |Jin_dynasty|Jin_Dynasty|  of the Manchu-related  |Jurchen_people|Jurchen_People| . The new Jin kingdom  |invaded_northern_China|Jin–Song_Wars| , leaving the Song to flee farther south and creating the  |Southern_Song_dynasty|Southern_Song_Dynasty|  in 1126. There, cultural life flourished.           By 1227, the Mongols had conquered the  |Western_Xia|Western_Xia|  kingdom northwest of China. Soon the Mongols incurred upon the Jin empire of the Jurchens. Chinese cities were soon besieged by the Mongol hordes that showed little mercy for those who resisted and the Southern Song Chinese were quickly losing territory. In 1271 the current great khan,  |Kublai_Khan|Kublai_Khan| , claimed himself Emperor of China and officially established the Yuan Dynasty. By 1290, all of China was under control of the Mongols, marking the first time they were ever completely conquered by a foreign invader; the new capital was established at  |Khanbaliq|Khanbaliq|  . Kublai Khan segregated Mongol culture from Chinese culture by discouraging interactions between the two peoples, separating living spaces and places of worship, and reserving top administrative positions to Mongols, thus preventing Confucian scholars to continue the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, Kublai remained fascinated with Chinese thinking, surrounding himself with Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian advisors.     Mongol women displayed a contrasting independent nature compared to the Chinese women who continued to be suppressed. Mongol women often rode out on hunts or even to war. Kublais wife,  |Chabi|Chabi| , was a perfect example of this; Chabi advised her husband on several political and diplomatic matters; she convinced him that the Chinese were to be respected and well-treated in order to make them easier to rule. However this was not enough to affect Chinese womens position, and the increasingly Neo-Confucian successors of Kublai further repressed Chinese and even Mongol women.     The Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe, had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331.                |Asuka_period|Asuka_Period| , from around 600 to 710. The time was characterized by the  |Taika_Reform|Taika_Reform|  and imperial centralization, both of which were a direct result of growing Chinese contact and influences. In 603,  |Prince_Shōtoku|Prince_Shōtoku|  of the  |Yamato_dynasty|Imperial_House_Of_Japan|  began significant political and cultural changes. He issued the  |Seventeen-article_constitution|Seventeen-Article_Constitution|  in 604, centralizing power towards the emperor  and removing the power to levy taxes from provincial lords. Shōtoku was also a patron of Buddhism and he encouraged building temples competitively.      |Nara_period|Nara_Period|  , with the moving of the Japanese capital to  |Nara|Nara,_Nara|  in  |Honshu|Honshu| . This period saw the culmination of Chinese-style writing, etiquette, and architecture in Japan along with Confucian ideals to supplement the already present Buddhism. Peasants revered both Confucian scholars and Buddhist monks. However, in the wake of the  |735–737_Japanese_smallpox_epidemic|735–737_Japanese_Smallpox_Epidemic| , Buddhism gained the status of state religion and the government ordered the construction of numerous Buddhist temples, monasteries, and statues. The lavish spending combined with the fact that many aristocrats did not pay taxes, put a heavy burden on peasantry that caused poverty and famine. Eventually the Buddhist position got out of control, threatening to seize imperial power and causing  |Emperor_Kanmu|Emperor_Kanmu|  to move the capital to  |Heian-kyō|Heian-Kyō|  to avoid a Buddhist takeover. This marked the beginning of the  |Heian_period|Heian_Period|  and the end of Taika reform.      |heavenly_mandate|Mandate_Of_Heaven| , which came to be regarded as ineffective. By 838, the Japanese court discontinued its embassies in China; only traders and Buddhist monks continued to travel to China. Buddhism itself came to be considered more Japanese than Chinese, and persisted to be popular in Japan. Buddhists monks and monasteries continued their attempts to gather personal power in courts, along with aristocrats. One particular noble family that dominated influence in the imperial bureaucracy was the  |Fujiwara_clan|Fujiwara_Clan| . During this time cultural life in the imperial court flourished. There was a focus on beauty and social interaction and writing and literature was considered refined. Noblewomen were cultured the same as noblemen, dabbling in creative works and politics. A prime example of both Japanese literature and womens role in high-class culture at this time was  The Tale of Genji , written by the  |lady-in-waiting|Lady-In-Waiting| |Murasaki_Shikibu|Murasaki_Shikibu| . Popularization of wooden palaces and  |shōji|Shōji|  sliding doors amongst the nobility also occurred.     Loss of imperial power also led to the rise of provincial warrior elites. Small lords began to function independently. They administered laws, supervised public works projects, and collected revenue for themselves instead of the imperial court. Regional lords also began to build their own armies. These warriors were loyal only their local lords and not the emperor, although the imperial government increasingly called them in to protect the capital. The regional warrior class developed into the  |samurai|Samurai| , which created its own culture: including specialized weapons such as the  |katana|Katana|  and a form of chivalry,  |bushido|Bushido| . The imperial governments loss of control in the second half of the Heian period allowed banditry to grow, requiring both feudal lords and Buddhist monasteries to procure warriors for protection. As imperial control over Japan declined, feudal lords also became more independent and seceded from the empire. These feudal states squandered the peasants living in them, reducing the farmers to an almost  |serfdom|Serfdom|  status. Peasants were also rigidly restricted from rising to the samurai class, being physically set off by dress and weapon restrictions. As a result of their oppression, many peasants turned to Buddhism as a hope for reward in the afterlife for upright behavior.     With the increase of feudalism, families in the imperial court began to depend on alliances with regional lords. The Fujiwara clan declined from power, replaced by a rivalry between the  |Taira_clan|Taira_Clan|  and the  |Minamoto_clan|Minamoto_Clan| . This rivalry grew into the  |Genpei_War|Genpei_War|  in the early 1180s. This war saw the use of both samurai and peasant soldiers. For the samurai, battle was ritual and they often easily cut down the poorly trained peasantry. The Minamoto clan proved successful due to their rural alliances. Once the Taira was destroyed, the Minamoto established a military government called the  |shogunate|Shogunate|  , centered in  |Kamakura|Kamakura,_Kanagawa| .      |Kamakura_shogunate|Kamakura_Shogunate|  marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the  |Kamakura_period|Kamakura_Period|  in 1185, solidifying feudal Japan.          Korea was fought between the three local kingdoms:  |Silla|Silla| ,  |Baekje|Baekje| , and  |Goguryeo|Goguryeo| . This continued until the Silla allied with Tang China to conquer all of Korea. Attempts at sinicization occurred.                    The  |Russian_Empire|Russian_Empire|  began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of  |Siberia|Siberia|  and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire|  controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the  |Manchu|Manchu_People|  conquered China and established the  |Qing_Dynasty|Qing_Dynasty| . In the 16th century, the  |Mughal_Empire|Mughal_Empire|  controlled much of India and initiated the second golden age for India. China was the largest economy in the world for much of the time, followed by India until the 18th century.         By 1368,  |Zhu_Yuanzhang|Zhu_Yuanzhang|  had claimed himself  |Hongwu_Emperor|Hongwu_Emperor|  and established the Ming dynasty of China. Immediately, the new emperor and his followers drove the Mongols and their culture out of China and beyond the Great Wall. The new emperor was somewhat suspicious of the scholars that dominated Chinas bureaucracy, for he had been born a peasant and was uneducated. Nevertheless, Confucian scholars were necessary to Chinas bureaucracy and were reestablished as well as reforms that would improve the exam systems and make them more important in entering the bureaucracy than ever before. The exams became more rigorous, cut down harshly on cheating, and those who excelled were more highly appraised. Finally, Hongwu also directed more power towards the role of emperor so as to end the corrupt influences of the bureaucrats.       The Hongwu emperor, perhaps for his sympathy of the common-folk, had built many irrigation systems and other public projects that provided help for the peasant farmers. They were also allowed to cultivate and claim unoccupied land without having to pay any taxes and labor demands were lowered. However, none of this was able to stop the rising landlord class that gained many privileges from the government and slowly gained control of the peasantry. Moneylenders foreclosed on peasant debt in exchange for mortgages and bought up farmer land, forcing them to become the landlords tenants or to wander elsewhere for work. Also during this time,  |Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism|  intensified even more than the previous two dynasties . Focus on the superiority of elders over youth, men over women, and teachers over students resulted in minor discrimination of the inferior classes. The fine arts grew in the Ming era, with improved techniques in brush painting that depicted scenes of court, city or country life; people such as scholars or travelers; or the beauty of mountains, lakes, or marshes. The Chinese novel fully developed in this era, with such classics written such as  Water Margin ,  Journey to the West , and  Jin Ping Mei .     Economics grew rapidly in the Ming Dynasty as well. The introduction of American crops such as  |maize|Maize| ,  |sweet_potatoes|Sweet_Potatoes| , and  |peanuts|Peanut|  allowed for cultivation of crops in infertile land and helped prevent famine. The population boom that began in the Song dynasty accelerated until Chinas population went from 80 or 90 million to 150 million in three centuries, culminating in 1600. This paralleled the market economy that was growing both internally and externally. Silk, tea, ceramics, and lacquer-ware were produced by artisans that traded them in Asia and to Europeans. Westerners began to trade , primarily in the port-towns of  |Macau|Macau|  and  |Canton|Guangzhou| . Although merchants benefited greatly from this, land remained the primary symbol of wealth in China and traders riches were often put into acquiring more land. Therefore, little of these riches were used in private enterprises that couldve allowed for China to develop the  |market_economy|Market_Economy|  that often accompanied the highly-successful Western countries.          In the interest of national glory, the Chinese began sending impressive  |junk|Junk|  ships across the  |South_China_Sea|South_China_Sea|  and the  |Indian_Ocean|Indian_Ocean| . From 1403 to 1433, the  |Yongle_Emperor|Yongle_Emperor|  commissioned  |expeditions|Treasure_Voyages|  led by the admiral  |Zheng_He|Zheng_He| , a Muslim  |eunuch|Eunuch|  from China. Chinese junks carrying hundreds of soldiers, goods, and animals for zoos, traveled to Southeast Asia, Persia, southern Arabia, and east Africa to show off Chinese power. Their prowess exceeded that of current Europeans at the time, and had these expeditions not ended, the world economy may be different from today. In 1433, the Chinese government decided that the cost of a navy was an unnecessary expense. The Chinese navy was slowly dismantled and focus on interior reform and military defense began. It was Chinas longstanding priority that they protect themselves from nomads and they have accordingly returned to it. The growing limits on the Chinese navy would leave them vulnerable to foreign invasion by sea later on.          As was inevitable, Westerners arrived on the Chinese east coast, primarily  |Jesuit|Jesuit|  missionaries which reached the mainland in 1582. They attempted to  |convert_the_Chinese_people_to_Christianity|Jesuit_China_Missions|  by first converting the top of the social hierarchy and allowing the lower classes to subsequently convert. To further gain support, many Jesuits adopted Chinese dress, customs, and language. Some Chinese scholars were interested in certain Western teachings and especially in Western technology. By the 1580s, Jesuit scholars like  |Matteo_Ricci|Matteo_Ricci|  and  |Adam_Schall|Adam_Schall|  amazed the Chinese elite with technological advances such as European clocks, improved calendars and cannons, and the accurate prediction of eclipses. Although some the scholar-gentry converted, many were suspicious of the Westerners whom they called barbarians and even resented them for the embarrassment they received at the hand of Western correction. Nevertheless, a small group of Jesuit scholars remained at the court to impress the emperor and his advisors.            Near the end of the 1500s, the extremely centralized government that gave so much power to the emperor had begun to fail as more incompetent rulers took the mantle. Along with these weak rulers came increasingly corrupt officials who took advantage of the decline. Once more the public projects fell into disrepair due to neglect by the bureaucracy and resulted in floods, drought, and famine that rocked the peasantry. The famine soon became so terrible that some peasants resorted to selling their children to slavery to save them from starvation, or to eating bark, the feces of geese, or  |other_people|Cannibalism| . Many landlords abused the situation by building large estates where desperate farmers would work and be exploited. In turn, many of these farmers resorted to flight, banditry, and open rebellion.     All of this corresponded with the usual dynastic decline of China seen before, as well as the growing foreign threats. In the mid-16th century, Japanese and ethnic Chinese pirates began to raid the southern coast, and neither the bureaucracy nor the military were able to stop them. The threat of the northern  |Manchu_people|Manchu_People|  also grew. The Manchu were an already large state north of China, when in the early 17th century a local leader named  |Nurhaci|Nurhaci|  suddenly united them under the  |Eight_Banners|Eight_Banners| —armies that the opposing families were organized into. The Manchus adopted many Chinese customs, specifically taking after their bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Manchus still remained a Chinese  |vassal|Vassal| . In 1644 Chinese administration became so weak, the 16th and last emperor, the  |Chongzhen_Emperor|Chongzhen_Emperor| , did not respond to the severity of an ensuing rebellion by local dissenters until the enemy had invaded the  |Forbidden_City|Forbidden_City|  . He soon hanged himself in the imperial gardens. For a brief amount of time, the  |Shun_dynasty|Shun_Dynasty|  was claimed, until a loyalist Ming official called support from the Manchus to put down the new dynasty. The Shun Dynasty ended within a year and the Manchu were now within the Great Wall. Taking advantage of the situation, the Manchus marched on the Chinese capital of Beijing.  |Within_two_decades|Manchu_Conquest_Of_China|  all of China belonged to the Manchu and the  |Qing_dynasty|Qing_Dynasty|  was established.           In early-modern Japan following the  |Sengoku_period|Sengoku_Period|  of warring states , central government had been largely reestablished by  |Oda_Nobunaga|Oda_Nobunaga|  and  |Toyotomi_Hideyoshi|Toyotomi_Hideyoshi|  during the  |Azuchi–Momoyama_period|Azuchi–Momoyama_Period| . After the  |Battle_of_Sekigahara|Battle_Of_Sekigahara|  in 1600, central authority fell to  |Tokugawa_Ieyasu|Tokugawa_Ieyasu|  who completed this process and received the title of  shōgun  in 1603.     Society in the Japanese  |Tokugawa_period|Tokugawa_Shogunate|  , unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class  |hierarchy|Hierarchy|  originally established by  |Toyotomi_Hideyoshi|Toyotomi_Hideyoshi| . The  daimyō s were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of  |samurai|Samurai| , with the farmers, artisans, and merchants ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the  Sakoku  policy. Literacy rose in the two centuries of isolation. Geoffrey Barraclough and Norman Stone, Harper Collins Atlas of World History p 175.     In some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, daimyōs and samurai were more or less identical, since daimyōs might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this  |social_stratification|Social_Stratification|  system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the  |peasantry|Peasantry|  were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers. McClain, Japan: A Modern History pp 69-75.             On the  |Indian_subcontinent|Indian_Subcontinent| , the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century.  The classic period ended with the death of  |Mughal_Emperor|Mughal_Empire| |Aurangzeb|Aurangzeb| ,  although the dynasty continued for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the  |Peshwas|Peshwa| , the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the  |Third_Battle_of_Panipat|Third_Battle_Of_Panipat|  which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.          The European economic and naval powers pushed into Asia, first to do trading, and then to take over major colonies. The Dutch led the way followed by the British. Portugal had arrived first, but was too weak to maintain its small holdings and was largely pushed out, retaining only  |Goa|Goa|  and  |Macau|Macau| . The British set up a private organization, the  |East_India_Company|East_India_Company| , which handled both trade and Imperial control of much of India. Holden Furber, Rival Empires of Trade in the Orient, 1600–1800 .     The  |commercial_colonization_of_India|Company_Rule_In_India|  commenced in 1757, after the  |Battle_of_Plassey|Battle_Of_Plassey| , when the  |Nawab_of_Bengal|Nawab_Of_Bengal|  surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,  in 1765, when the Company was granted the diwani, or the right to collect revenue, in  |Bengal|Bengal|  and  |Bihar|Bihar| , ,  or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in  |Calcutta|Calcutta| , appointed its first  |Governor-General|Governor-General_Of_India| ,  |Warren_Hastings|Warren_Hastings| , and became directly involved in governance.           The  |Maratha_states|Maratha_Empire| , following the  |Anglo-Maratha_wars|Anglo-Maratha_Wars| , eventually lost to the  |British_East_India_Company|British_East_India_Company|  in 1818 with the  |Third_Anglo-Maratha_War|Third_Anglo-Maratha_War| . The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the  |Indian_rebellion_of_1857|Indian_Rebellion_Of_1857|  and consequent of the  |Government_of_India_Act_1858|Government_Of_India_Act_1858| , the  |British_government|India_Office|  assumed the task of directly administering India in the new  |British_Raj|British_Raj| .  In 1819  |Stamford_Raffles|Stamford_Raffles|  established  |Singapore|Singapore|  as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an  |Anglo-Dutch_treaty|Anglo-Dutch_Treaty_Of_1824|  demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.     The  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company|  and  |British_East_India_Company|British_East_India_Company|  were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only  |Thailand|Thailand|  was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the regions vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent. Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.                      |The_Great_Game|The_Great_Game|  was a political and diplomatic confrontation between Great Britain and Russia over  |Afghanistan|History_Of_Afghanistan|  and neighbouring territories in  |Central|Central_Asia|  and  |South_Asia|South_Asia| . It lasted from 1828 to 1907. There was no war, but there were many threats. Russia was fearful of British commercial and military inroads into  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| , and Britain was fearful of Russia threatening its largest and most important possession, India. This resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires. Britain made it a high priority to protect all the approaches to India, and the great game is primarily how the British did this in terms of a possible Russian threat. Historians with access to the archives have concluded that Russia had no plans involving India, as the Russians repeatedly stated. Barbara Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814–1974 p 200     The Great Game began in 1838 when Britain decided to gain control over the  |Emirate_of_Afghanistan|Emirate_Of_Afghanistan|  and make it a protectorate, and to use the  |Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman_Empire| , the  |Persian_Empire|Qajar_Dynasty| , the  |Khanate_of_Khiva|Khanate_Of_Khiva| , and the Emirate of Bukhara as buffer states between both empires. This would protect India and also key British sea trade routes by stopping Russia from gaining a port on the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean. Russia proposed Afghanistan as the neutral zone, and the final result was diving up Afghanistan with a neutral zone in the middle between Russian areas in the north and British in the South. Important episodes included the failed  |First_Anglo-Afghan_War|First_Anglo-Afghan_War|  of 1838, the  |First_Anglo-Sikh_War|First_Anglo-Sikh_War|  of 1845, the  |Second_Anglo-Sikh_War|Second_Anglo-Sikh_War|  of 1848, the  |Second_Anglo-Afghan_War|Second_Anglo-Afghan_War|  of 1878, and the annexation of  |Kokand|Khanate_Of_Kokand|  by Russia.    The 1901 novel  |Kim|Kim|  by  |Rudyard_Kipling|Rudyard_Kipling|  made the term popular and introduced the new implication of great power rivalry. It became even more popular after the 1979 advent of the  |Soviet–Afghan_War|Soviet–Afghan_War| . Seymour Becker, The ‘great game’: The history of an evocative phrase. Asian Affairs 43.1 : 61-80.             By 1644, the northern  |Manchu_people|Manchu_People|  had conquered China and established a foreign dynasty—the  |Qing_Dynasty|Qing_Dynasty| —once more. The Manchu Qing emperors, especially Confucian scholar  |Kangxi|Kangxi_Emperor| , remained largely conservative—retaining the bureaucracy and the scholars within it, as well as the Confucian ideals present in Chinese society. However, changes in the economy and new attempts at resolving certain issues occurred too. These included increased trade with Western countries that brought large amounts of silver into the Chinese economy in exchange for tea,  |porcelain|Porcelain| , and silk textiles. This allowed for a new merchant-class, the  |compradors|Comprador| , to develop. In addition, repairs were done on existing  |dikes|Levee| , canals, roadways, and  |irrigation|Irrigation|  works. This, combined with the lowering of taxes and government-assigned labor, was supposed to calm peasant unrest. However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.     By the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing Chinas politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.            China saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners. Originally, European traders were at a disadvantage because the Chinese cared little for their goods, while European demand for Chinese commodities such as tea and porcelain only grew. In order to tip the trade imbalance in their favor, British merchants began to sell Indian  |opium|Opium|  to the Chinese. Not only did this sap Chinese bullion reserves, it also led to widespread drug addiction amongst the  |bureaucracy|Scholar_Official|  and society in general. A ban was placed on opium as early as 1729 by the  |Yongzheng_Emperor|Yongzheng_Emperor| , but little was done to enforce it. By the early 19th century, under the new  |Daoguang_Emperor|Daoguang_Emperor| , the government began serious efforts to eradicate opium from Chinese society. Leading this endeavour were respected scholar-officials including  |Imperial_Commissioner|Imperial_Commissioner| |Lin_Zexu|Lin_Zexu| .     After Lin  |destroyed_more_than_20,000_chests_of_opium|Destruction_Of_Opium_At_Humen|  in the summer of 1839, Europeans demanded compensation for what they saw as unwarranted Chinese interference in their affairs. When it was not paid, the British declared war later the same year, starting what became known as the  |First_Opium_War|First_Opium_War| . The outdated Chinese  |junks|Junk|  were no match for the advanced British gunboats, and soon the  |Yangzi_River|Yangzi_River|  region came under threat of British bombardment and invasion. The emperor had no choice but to sue for peace, resulting in the exile of Lin and the making of the  |Treaty_of_Nanking|Treaty_Of_Nanking| , which ceded the British control of  |Hong_Kong|Hong_Kong|  and opened up trade and diplomacy with other European countries, including Germany, France, and the USA.

Steven I. Levine, Anvil of Victory: The Communist Revolution in Manchuria, 1945-1948 .               The European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the early 20th century, such as  |British_India|British_Raj| ,  |French_Indochina|French_Indochina| ,  |Spanish_East_Indies|Spanish_East_Indies| , and Portuguese  |Macau|Macau|  and  |Goa|Goa| .
