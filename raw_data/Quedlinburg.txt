The town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as Gross Orden on the eastern bank of the River  |Bode|Bode_River| . It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King  |Henry_the_Fowler|Henry_The_Fowler|  . The records of this donation were held by the abbey of  |Corvey|Corvey| .     According to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the cradle of the German Reich .      After Henrys death in 936, his widow  |Saint_Matilda|Matilda_Of_Ringelheim|  founded a religious community for women  on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation,  |Quedlinburg_Abbey|Quedlinburg_Abbey| , was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The  Annals of Quedlinburg  were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.     The Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by  |Emperor_Otto_I|Otto_The_Great|  in 936, was an imperial  Pfalz  of the Saxon emperors. The Pfalz, including the male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of St. Wiperti is situated, while the womens convent was located on the castle hill.     In 973, shortly before the death of  |Emperor_Otto_I|Otto_The_Great| , a  Reichstag  was held at the imperial court in which  |Mieszko|Mieszko_I_Of_Poland| , duke of  |Polans|Polans| , and  |Boleslav|Boleslav_I_Of_Bohemia| , duke of  |Bohemia|Bohemia| , as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as  |Byzantium|Byzantium|  and  |Bulgaria|Bulgaria| , gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law  |Theophanu|Theophanu| , a Byzantine princess whose marriage to  |Otto_II|Otto_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.     In 994,  |Otto_III|Otto_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.     The town became a member of the  |Hanseatic_League|Hanseatic_League|  in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the  |Bishopric_of_Halberstadt|Bishopric_Of_Halberstadt| . In 1477,  |Abbess_Hedwig|Hedwig,_Abbess_Of_Quedlinburg| , aided by her brothers  |Ernest|Ernest,_Elector_Of_Saxony|  and  |Albert|Albert,_Duke_Of_Saxony| , broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishops forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the  |Electorate_of_Saxony|Electorate_Of_Saxony| . Both town and abbey converted to  |Lutheranism|Lutheranism|  in 1539 during the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| .     In 1697, Elector  |Frederick_Augustus_I|Augustus_Ii_The_Strong|  of Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector  |Frederick_III_of_Brandenburg|Frederick_I_Of_Prussia|  for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested  |Brandenburg-Prussias|Brandenburg-Prussia|  claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the  |German_Mediatisation|German_Mediatisation| , and Quedlinburg passed to the  |Kingdom_of_Prussia|Kingdom_Of_Prussia|  as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg. Part of the  |Napoleonic|Napoleonic_Wars| |Kingdom_of_Westphalia|Kingdom_Of_Westphalia|  from 1807–13, it was included within the new Prussian  |Province_of_Saxony|Province_Of_Saxony|  in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without taking the veil ; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for womens rights,  |Sofia_Albertina|Sophia_Albertina,_Abbess_Of_Quedlinburg| .     During the  |Nazi_regime|Nazism| , the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as  |Heinrich_Himmler|Heinrich_Himmler|  saw himself as the reincarnation of the most German of all German rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany| . The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed from 1938 and during the war. The local  |crematory|Crematory|  was kept busy burning the victims of the  |Langenstein-Zwieberge|Langenstein-Zwieberge|  concentration camp.  |Georg_Ay|Georg_Ay|  was local party chief from 1931 until the end of the war. Liberation in 1945 brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was taken down from the tower.

In the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the  |theft_of_medieval_art_from_Quedlinburg|Theft_Of_Medieval_Art_From_Quedlinburg|  came to light.
