         A diacritic – also diacritical mark, diacritical point, diacritical sign, or accent – is a  |glyph|Glyph|  added to a  |letter|Letter|  or basic glyph. The term derives from the  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|   , from  . Diacritic is primarily an  |adjective|Adjective| , though sometimes used as a  |noun|Noun| , whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the  |acute|Acute_Accent|  and  |grave|Grave_Accent|  , are often called accents. Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.     The main use of diacritical marks in the  |Latin_script|Latin_Script|  is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Examples are the  |diaereses|Diaeresis|  in the borrowed French words  and , which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding  |vowel|Vowel| ; the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced, as in  saké  and poetic breathèd; and the  |cedilla|Cedilla|  under the c in the borrowed French word , which shows it is pronounced  rather than . In other  |Latin-script_alphabets|Latin-Script_Alphabet| , they may distinguish between  |homonyms|Homonym| , such as the  |French|French_Language|   versus  that are both pronounced . In  |Gaelic_type|Gaelic_Type| , a dot over a consonant indicates  |lenition|Lenition|  of the consonant in question.     In other  |alphabetic_systems|Alphabettypes| , diacritical marks may perform other functions.  |Vowel_pointing|Vowel_Pointing|  systems, namely the  |Arabic|Arabic_Language| |harakat|Arabic_Diacritics|   and the  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language| |niqqud|Niqqud|   systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The  |Indic|Indic_Script| |virama|Virama|  and the Arabic  |sukūn|Sukūn|   mark the absence of vowels.  |Cantillation_marks|Cantillation_Mark|  indicate  |prosody|Prosody| . Other uses include the  |Early_Cyrillic|Early_Cyrillic| |titlo|Titlo|  stroke and the Hebrew  |gershayim|Gershayim|  , which, respectively, mark  |abbreviations|Abbreviation|  or  |acronyms|Acronym| , and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as  |numerals|Greek_Numerals| . In the  |Hanyu_Pinyin|Pinyin|  official romanization system for Chinese, diacritics are used to mark the  |tones|Standard_Chinese_Phonologytones|  of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.     In  |orthography|Orthography|  and  |collation|Collation| , a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter–diacritic combination. This varies from language to language, and may vary from case to case within a language. English is the only major modern  |European_language|Languages_Of_Europe|  requiring no diacritics for native words . As an example, an article containing a  |diaeresis|Diaeresis|  in coöperate and a  |cedilla|Cedilla|  in façades as well as a  |circumflex|Circumflex|  in the word crêpe       In some cases, letters are used as in-line diacritics , with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the h in the English pronunciation of sh and th . Henry Sweet A Handbook of Phonetics, p 174–175: Even letters with accents and diacritics being only cast for a few founts, act practically as new letters. We may consider the h in sh and th simply as a diacritic written for convenience on a line with the letter it modifies.       Among the types of diacritic used in alphabets based on the  |Latin_script|Latin_Script|  are:   accents    ◌́ –  |acute|Acute_Accent|     ◌̀ –  |grave|Grave_Accent|  ◌̂ –  |circumflex|Circumflex_Accent|  ◌̌ –  |caron|Caron| , wedge    ◌̋ –  |double_acute|Double_Acute_Accent|  ◌̏ –  |double_grave|Double_Grave_Accent|  ◌̃ -  |tilde|Tilde|  ◌̇ –  |overdot|Dot|     ◌̣ – an  |underdot|Dot|  is used in  and in Hebrew, Indic and Arabic transcription   ◌·◌ –  |interpunct|Interpunct| |tittle|Tittle| , the superscript dot of the modern  |lowercase|Lowercase|  Latin i and j ◌̈ –  |umlaut|Umlaut|  or  |diaeresis|Diaeresis|  ◌ː –  |triangular_colon|Colon| , used in the  |IPA|International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  to mark  |long_vowels|Vowel_Length| .   curves   ◌̆ –  |breve|Breve|  ◌̑ -  |inverted_breve|Inverted_Breve|  ◌͗ –  |sicilicus|Sicilicus| , a  |palaeographic|Palaeography|  diacritic similar to a caron or breve   ◌̃ –  |tilde|Tilde|  ◌҃ –  |titlo|Titlo|  ◌̩ –  |syllabic|Syllabic_Consonant|  a subscript vertical stroke is used in  |IPA|International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  to mark syllabicity and in  to mark a  |schwa|Schwa|  ◌̄ –  |macron|Macron|  ◌̱ –  |underbar|Macron_Below|  ◌⃓ –  |vertical_bar|Bar|  through the character   ◌̷ –  |slash|Bar|  through the character   ◌̵ –  |crossbar|Bar|  through the character   ring   ◌̊ –  |overring|Ring|  ◌̓ –  |apostrophe|Apostrophe|  ◌̒ —  |inverted_apostrophe|Inverted_Apostrophe|  ◌̔ -  |reversed_apostrophe|Reversed_Apostrophe|  ◌̉  –  |hoi|Hook_Above|     ◌̛ –  |horn|Horn|     subscript curls   ◌̦ –  |undercomma|Commadiacritical_Usage|  ◌̧ –  |cedilla|Cedilla|  ◌̡ ◌̢ –  |hook|Hook| , left or right, sometimes superscript   ◌̨ –  |ogonek|Ogonek|  ◌͝◌ –  |double_breve|Tie|  ◌͡◌ –  |tie_bar|Tie|  or top ligature   ◌᷍◌ – double circumflex   ◌͞◌ – longum   ◌͠◌ – double tilde   double sub/superscript diacritics   ◌̧ ̧ -  |double_cedilla|Double_Cedilla|  ◌̨ ̨ -  |double_ogonek|Double_Cedilla|  ◌̈ ̈ - double diaeresis   ◌ͅͺ  -  |double_ypogegrammeni|Double_Ypogegrammeni|      The tilde, dot, comma,  |titlo|Titlo| , apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses.     Not all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the  |Wali_language|Wali_Language|  of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects ’Bulengee and ’Dolimi. Because of  |vowel_harmony|Vowel_Harmony| , all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In  |abugida|Abugida|  scripts, like those used to write  |Hindi|Hindi|  and  |Thai|Thai_Language| , diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.     The tittle on the letter i or the letter j, of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish i from the  |minims|Minim|  of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence ii , then spread to i adjacent to m, n, u, and finally to all lowercase is. The j, originally a variant of i, inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling todays acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of  |Roman_type|Roman_Type|  it was reduced to the round dot we have today.  Oxford English Dictionary      Languages from Eastern Europe tend to use diacritics on both consonants and vowels, whereas in Western Europe  |digraphs|Digraph|  are more typically used to change consonant sounds. Most languages in Western Europe use diacritics on vowels, aside from English where there are typically none .             |glottal_stop|Glottal_Stop| .     symbols: Serve a grammatical role in  |Arabic|Arabic_Language| .
