It can be  |eaten_raw|Raw_Foodism|  or cooked. Edible preparations are made with both the stem and the leaves. Despite its common names, it is not the same species as  |turnip|Turnip| .       The name comes from the  |German|German_Language|  Kohl plus Rübe ~ Rabi  , because the swollen stem resembles the latter.  Kohlrabi is a commonly eaten vegetable in German-speaking countries and American states with large ancestral German populations such as Wisconsin, but is also very popular in the northern part of  |Vietnam|Vietnam|  where it is called , and in eastern parts of India and  |Bangladesh|Bangladesh|  where it is called Ol Kopi.

This vegetable is called Nol Khol in Northern India,  Navalkol in  |Maharashtra|Maharashtra| , Noolkol in  |Tamil|Tamil_Language| , Navilu Kosu in  |Karnataka|Karnataka|   and in  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka|  as Nol col .  |John_Whitchurch_Bennett|John_Whitchurch_Bennett|   It is also native in  |Cyprus|Cyprus|  where it is known as kouloumpra .

Kohlrabi has been created by  |artificial_selection|Artificial_Selection|  for lateral  |meristem|Meristem|  growth ; its origin in nature is the same as that of  |cabbage|Cabbage| ,  |broccoli|Broccoli| ,  |cauliflower|Cauliflower| ,  |kale|Kale| ,  |collard_greens|Collard_Greens| , and  |Brussels_sprouts|Brussels_Sprout| : they are all bred from, and are the same species as, the  |wild_cabbage|Brassica_Oleracea|  plant .     The taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to those of a  |broccoli|Broccoli|  stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter, with a higher ratio of flesh to skin. The young stem in particular can be as crisp and juicy as an apple, although much less sweet.       Except for the Gigante cultivar, spring-grown kohlrabi much over 5  cm in size tend to be woody, as do full-grown kohlrabi much over perhaps 10  cm in size; the Gigante cultivar can achieve great size while remaining of good eating quality.  The plant matures in 55–60 days after sowing and has good standing ability for up to 30 days after maturity. The approximate weight is 150 g.           There are several varieties commonly available, including White Vienna,  Purple Vienna, Grand Duke, Gigante , Purple Danube, and White Danube. Coloration of the purple types is superficial: the edible parts are all pale yellow. The leafy greens can also be eaten. One commonly used variety grows without a swollen stem, having just leaves and a very thin stem, and is called Haakh. Haakh and Monj are popular Kashmiri dishes made using this vegetable. In the second year, the plant will bloom and develop seeds. Kohlrabi also comes in three different colors: white, purple, and pale green.       Kohlrabi stems are surrounded by two distinct fibrous layers that do not soften appreciably when cooked. These layers are generally peeled away prior to cooking or serving raw, with the result that the stems often provide a smaller amount of food than one might assume from their intact appearance.     The bulbous kohlrabi stem is frequently used raw in salad or slaws. It has a texture similar to that of a broccoli stem, but with a flavor that is sweeter and less vegetal.     Kohlrabi leaves are edible and can be used interchangeably with  |collard_greens|Collard_Greens|  and  |kale|Kale| .     Kohlrabi is an important part of the  |Kashmiri_cuisine|Kashmiri_Cuisine|  where it is called Mŏnji and is one of the most commonly cooked vegetable along with collard greens . It is prepared with its leaves and served with a light soup and eaten with rice.     In Cyprus it is popularly sprinkled with salt and lemon and served as an appetizer.
