In  |complex_analysis|Complex_Analysis| , an entire function, also called an integral function, is a complex-valued  |function|Function|  that is  |holomorphic|Holomorphic_Function|  at all finite points over the whole  |complex_plane|Complex_Plane| . Typical examples of entire functions are  |polynomials|Polynomial|  and the  |exponential_function|Exponential_Function| , and any finite sums, products and compositions of these, such as the  |trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Function| |sine|Sine|  and  |cosine|Cosine|  and their  |hyperbolic_counterparts|Hyperbolic_Function| |sinh|Hyperbolic_Sine|  and  |cosh|Hyperbolic_Cosine| , as well as  |derivatives|Derivative|  and  |integrals|Integral|  of entire functions such as the  |error_function|Error_Function| . If an entire function f has a  |root|Root_Of_A_Function|  at w, then f/, taking the limit value at w, is an entire function. On the other hand, neither the  |natural_logarithm|Natural_Logarithm|  nor the  |square_root|Square_Root|  is an entire function, nor can they be  |continued_analytically|Analytic_Continuation|  to an entire function.     A  transcendental entire function is an entire function that is not a polynomial.       Every entire function f can be represented as a  |power_series|Power_Series|      : f  anzn     that converges everywhere in the complex plane, hence  |uniformly_on_compact_sets|Compact_Convergence| . The  |radius_of_convergence|Radius_Of_Convergence|  is infinite, which implies that     :    an 0     or     :         Any power series satisfying this criterion will represent an entire function.     If the coefficients of the power series are all real then the function evidently takes real values for real arguments, and the value of the function at the  |complex_conjugate|Complex_Conjugate|  of z will be the complex conjugate of the value at z. Such functions are sometimes called self-conjugate . For example,      If the real part of an entire function is known in a neighborhood of a point then both the real and imaginary parts are known for the whole complex plane,  |up_to|Up_To|  an imaginary constant. For instance, if the real part is known in a neighborhood of zero, then we can find the coefficients for n  math /math  math /math math /math  math /math  math /math  ref math /math  math /math  /ref  math /math  math /math  .
