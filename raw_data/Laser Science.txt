      Laser science or laser physics is a branch of  |optics|Optics|  that describes the theory and practice of  |lasers|Laser| .     Laser science is principally concerned with  |quantum_electronics|Quantum_Electronics| ,  |laser_construction|Laser_Construction| ,  |optical_cavity|Optical_Cavity|  design, the physics of producing a  |population_inversion|Population_Inversion|  in  |laser_media|Active_Laser_Medium| , and the temporal evolution of the light field in the laser. It is also concerned with the physics of laser beam propagation, particularly the physics of  |Gaussian_beams|Gaussian_Beam| , with  |laser_applications|Laser_Applications| , and with associated fields such as  |nonlinear_optics|Nonlinear_Optics|  and  |quantum_optics|Quantum_Optics| .          Laser science predates the invention of the laser itself.  |Albert_Einstein|Albert_Einstein|  created the foundations for the laser and  |maser|Maser|  in 1917, via a paper in which he re-derived  |Max_Planck|Max_Planck| ’s law of radiation using a formalism based on probability coefficients  for the  |absorption|Absorption| ,  |spontaneous_emission|Spontaneous_Emission| , and  |stimulated_emission|Stimulated_Emission|  of electromagnetic radiation.  The existence of stimulated emission was confirmed in 1928 by  |Rudolf_W._Ladenburg|Rudolf_W._Ladenburg| . Steen, W. M. Laser Materials Processing , 2nd Ed. 1998. In 1939, Valentin A. Fabrikant made the earliest laser proposal. He specified the conditions required for light amplification using stimulated emission.  In 1947,  |Willis_E._Lamb|Willis_E._Lamb|  and R. C. Retherford found apparent stimulated emission in hydrogen spectra and effected the first demonstration of stimulated emission; in 1950,  |Alfred_Kastler|Alfred_Kastler|  proposed the method of  |optical_pumping|Optical_Pumping| , experimentally confirmed, two years later, by Brossel, Kastler, and Winter.      The theoretical principles describing the operation of a microwave laser were first described by  |Nikolay_Basov|Nikolay_Basov|  and  |Alexander_Prokhorov|Alexander_Prokhorov|  at the All-Union Conference on Radio Spectroscopy in May 1952. The first maser was built by  |Charles_H._Townes|Charles_H._Townes| ,  |James_P._Gordon|James_P._Gordon| , and  |Herbert_J._Zeiger|Herbert_J._Zeiger|  in 1953. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the  |Nobel_Prize_in_Physics|Nobel_Prize_In_Physics|  in 1964 for their research in the field of stimulated emission.  |Arthur_Ashkin|Arthur_Ashkin| ,  |Gérard_Mourou|Gérard_Mourou| , and  |Donna_Strickland|Donna_Strickland|  were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics.      The first working laser  was demonstrated on May 16, 1960, by  |Theodore_Maiman|Theodore_Maiman|  at the  |Hughes_Research_Laboratories|Hughes_Research_Laboratories| .
