               The Hague  is a  |city|List_Of_Cities_In_The_Netherlands_By_Province|  on the western coast of the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  and the  |capital|Capital_City|  of the  |province|Provinces_Of_The_Netherlands|  of  |South_Holland|South_Holland| . It is also the  |seat_of_government|Seat_Of_Government|  of the Netherlands and hosts the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice| , one of the most important courts in the world.     With a metropolitan population of more than 1 million, it is the third-largest city in the Netherlands, after  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam|  and  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam| . The  |Rotterdam–The_Hague_metropolitan_area|Rotterdam–The_Hague_Metropolitan_Area| , with a population of approximately 2.7  million, is the  |13th-largest_in_the_European_Union|List_Of_Urban_Areas_In_The_European_Union|  and the most populous in the country. Located in the west of the Netherlands, The Hague is in the centre of the  |Haaglanden|Haaglanden| |conurbation|Conurbation|  and lies at the southwest corner of the larger  |Randstad|Randstad|  conurbation.     The Hague is the seat of the  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_Netherlands| , the  |States_General|States_General_Of_The_Netherlands| , the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_Netherlands| , and the  |Council_of_State|Council_Of_State|  of the Netherlands, but the city is not the  |constitutional|Constitution_Of_The_Netherlands| |capital_of_the_Netherlands|Capital_Of_The_Netherlands| , which is  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam| .   |King_Willem-Alexander|Willem-Alexander_Of_The_Netherlands|  lives in  |Huis_ten_Bosch|Huis_Ten_Bosch_Palace|   at The Official Website of the Dutch Royal House in English , maintained by the  |Netherlands_Government_Information_Service|Netherlands_Government_Information_Service| .  and works at the  |Noordeinde_Palace|Noordeinde_Palace|  in The Hague, together with  |Queen_Máxima|Máxima_Of_The_Netherlands| . Most foreign  |embassies|Diplomatic_Mission|  in the Netherlands are located in the city. The Hague is also home to the world headquarters of  |Royal_Dutch_Shell|Royal_Dutch_Shell|  and other Dutch companies.     The Hague is known as the home of international law and arbitration. The  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice| , the main judicial arm of the United Nations, is located in the city, as well as the  |International_Criminal_Court|International_Criminal_Court| , the  |Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration|Permanent_Court_Of_Arbitration| ,  |Europol|Europol| , and approximately 200 other international governmental organisations.        The Hague was first mentioned as Die Haghe in 1242. In the 15th century, the name des Graven hage came into use, literally The Counts Wood , with connotations like The Counts Hedge, Private Enclosure or Hunting Grounds . s Gravenhage was officially used for the city from the 17th century onward. Today, this name is only used in some official documents like birth and marriage certificates. The city itself uses Den Haag in all its communications.                       Little is known about the origin of The Hague. There are no contemporary documents describing it, and later sources are often of dubious reliability. What is certain is that The Hague was founded by the last counts of the  |House_of_Holland|House_Of_Holland| .  |Floris_IV|Floris_Iv,_Count_Of_Holland|  already owned two residences in the area, but presumably purchased a third court situated by the present-day  |Hofvijver|Hofvijver|  in 1229, previously owned by a woman called Meilendis. Presumably, Floris IV intended to rebuild the court into a large castle, but he died in a  |tournament|Tournament|  in 1234, before anything was built.  His son and successor  |William_II|William_Ii_Of_Holland|  lived in the court, and after he was elected  |King_of_the_Romans|King_Of_The_Romans|  in 1248, he promptly returned to The Hague, and had builders turn the court into a royal palace , which would later be called the  |Binnenhof|Binnenhof|  . He died in 1256 before this palace was completed but parts of it were finished during the reign of his son  |Floris_V|Floris_V,_Count_Of_Holland| , of which the  |Ridderzaal|Ridderzaal|  , still intact, is the most prominent.   It is still used for political events, such as the annual  |speech_from_the_throne|Speech_From_The_Throne|  by the  |Dutch|Netherlands| |monarch|Monarch| . From the 13th century onward, the counts of Holland used The Hague as their administrative center and residence when in Holland.     The village that originated around the Binnenhof was first mentioned as Die Haghe in a charter dating from 1242. It became the primary residence of the Counts of Holland in 1358, and thus became the seat of many government institutions. This status allowed the village to grow; by the Late Middle Ages, it had grown to the size of a city, although it did not receive city rights.  In its early years, the village was located in the ambacht, or rural district, of  |Monster|Monster,_South_Holland| , which was governed by the Lord of Monster. Seeking to exercise more direct control over the village, however, the Count split the village off and created a separate ambacht called Haagambacht, governed directly by the Counts of Holland. The territory of Haagambacht was considerably expanded during the reign of Floris V.      When the  |House_of_Burgundy|House_Of_Burgundy|  inherited the counties of Holland and Zeeland in 1432, they appointed a  |stadtholder|Stadtholder|  to rule in their stead with the  |States_of_Holland_and_West_Friesland|States_Of_Holland_And_West_Friesland|  as an advisory council. Although their seat was located in The Hague, the city became subordinate to more important centres of government such as  |Brussels|Brussels|  and  |Mechelen|Mechelen| , from where the sovereigns ruled over the increasingly centralised  |Burgundian_Netherlands|Burgundian_Netherlands| .     At the beginning of the  |Eighty_Years_War|Eighty_Years_War| , the absence of city walls proved disastrous, as it allowed  |Spanish|Spain|  troops to easily occupy the town. In 1575, the States of Holland, temporarily based in  |Delft|Delft| , even considered demolishing the city but this proposal was abandoned, after mediation by  |William_the_Silent|William_The_Silent| . In 1588, The Hague became the permanent seat of the States of Holland as well as the  |States_General|States_General_Of_The_Netherlands|  of the  |Dutch_Republic|Dutch_Republic| .  In order for the administration to maintain control over city matters, The Hague never received official city status, although it did have many of the privileges normally granted only to cities. In modern administrative law, city rights have no place anymore.             In 1806, when the  |Kingdom_of_Holland|Kingdom_Of_Holland|  was a puppet state of the  |First_French_Empire|First_French_Empire| , the settlement was granted city rights by  |Louis_Bonaparte|Louis_Bonaparte| .  After the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , modern-day  |Belgium|Belgium|  and the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  were combined in the  |United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands|United_Kingdom_Of_The_Netherlands|  to form a buffer against  |France|France| . As a compromise,  |Brussels|Brussels|  and  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam|  alternated as capital every two years, with the government remaining in The Hague. After the separation of Belgium in 1830, Amsterdam remained the capital of the Netherlands, while the government was situated in The Hague. When the government started to play a more prominent role in Dutch society after 1850, The Hague quickly expanded. Many streets were specifically built for the large number of civil servants employed in the countrys government and for the Dutchmen who were retiring from the administration of the  |Netherlands_East_Indies|Netherlands_East_Indies| . The growing city annexed the rural municipality of  |Loosduinen|Loosduinen|  partly in 1903 and completely in 1923.      The city sustained heavy damage during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Many Jews were killed during the German occupation. Additionally, the  |Atlantic_Wall|Atlantic_Wall|  was built through the city, causing a large quarter to be torn down by the Nazi occupants. On 3 March 1945, the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  mistakenly  |bombed|Bombing_Of_The_Bezuidenhout|  the  |Bezuidenhout|Bezuidenhout|  quarter. The target was an installation of  |V-2_rockets|V-2_Rocket|  in the nearby  |Haagse_Bos|Haagse_Bos|  park, but because of navigational errors, the bombs fell on a heavily populated and historic part of the city.  The bombardment wreaked widespread destruction in the area  and caused 511 fatalities.  , Amigoe di Curacao, 4 March 1965     After the war, The Hague became at one time the largest building site in Europe. The city expanded massively to the south-west, and the destroyed areas were quickly rebuilt. The population peaked at 600,000 inhabitants around 1965. In the 1970s and 1980s, mostly white middle-class families moved to neighbouring towns like  |Voorburg|Voorburg| ,  |Leidschendam|Leidschendam| ,  |Rijswijk|Rijswijk|  and, most of all,  |Zoetermeer|Zoetermeer| . This led to the traditional pattern of an impoverished inner city and more prosperous suburbs. Attempts to include parts of these municipalities in the city of The Hague were highly controversial. In the 1990s, with the consent of the Dutch Parliament, The Hague annexed fairly large areas from neighbouring towns as well as from not even bordering ones, on which the complete new residential areas were built and are still being built.                  The Hague is the largest Dutch city on the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  in the Netherlands and forms the centre of a  |conurbation|Conurbation|  called  |Haaglanden|Haaglanden| .  |Westland|Westland_,_Netherlands|  and  |Wateringen|Wateringen|  lie to the south,  |Rijswijk|Rijswijk| ,  |Delft|Delft|  and the  |Rotterdam|Rotterdam|  conurbation  to the southeast,  |Pijnacker-Nootdorp|Pijnacker-Nootdorp|  and  |Zoetermeer|Zoetermeer|  to the east,  |Leidschendam-Voorburg|Leidschendam-Voorburg| ,  |Voorschoten|Voorschoten|  and the  |Leiden|Leiden|  conurbation to the northeast and  |Wassenaar|Wassenaar|  to the north.     The conurbations around The Hague and Rotterdam are close enough to be a single conurbation in some contexts. For example, they share the  |Rotterdam_The_Hague_Airport|Rotterdam_The_Hague_Airport|  and a light rail system called  |RandstadRail|Randstadrail| . Consideration is being given to creating a Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan area. This large conurbation centred on The Hague and Rotterdam is, in turn, part of the  |Randstad|Randstad| —specifically a band of municipalities called the South Wing . The Randstad, which also includes among others  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam|  and  |Utrecht|Utrecht| , has a population of 6,659,300. The Hague lies at the southwestern corner of one of the largest urban areas in Europe.     The Hague is divided into eight official districts which are, in turn, divided into neighbourhoods.  Some of the most prosperous and some of the poorest neighbourhoods of the Netherlands can be found in The Hague. The wealthier areas like Statenkwartier,  |Belgisch_Park|Belgisch_Park| , Marlot,  |Benoordenhout|Benoordenhout|  and  |Archipelbuurt|The_Hague_Centerarchipelbuurt|  are generally located in the northwestern part of the city, closer to the sea, whereas the southeastern neighbourhoods like  |Transvaal|The_Hague_Centertransvaal| , Moerwijk, and the Schilderswijk are significantly poorer, with the exception of the  |Vinex-locations|Vinex-Location|  of  |Leidschenveen-Ypenburg|Leidschenveen-Ypenburg|  and Wateringse Veld. This division is reflected in the local accent: The more affluent citizens are usually called Hagenaars and speak so-called bekakt Haags , this contrasts with the Hagenezen, who speak plat Haags ; see  |Demographics|Demographics|  below.     The districts are:    Centrum  forms the heart of The Hague. The  |Binnenhof|Binnenhof| , the  |Noordeinde_Palace|Noordeinde_Palace| , the  |Mauritshuis|Mauritshuis|  museum, the  |Nieuwe_Kerk|Nieuwe_Kerk| , the  |Grote_Kerk|Grote_Of_Sint-Jacobskerk| , the  |Old_City_Hall|Old_City_Hall|  and the current  |City_Hall|The_Hague_City_Hall|  are located here. Architecture varies from medieval up to 20th century.    Escamp  is the most populous district of The Hague, built largely after the  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  as part of The Hagues large expansion to the south east. One railway station can be found here:  |Den_Haag_Moerwijk|Den_Haag_Moerwijk_Railway_Station| . The district is divided into six neighbourhoods.    Haagse Hout  is a wealthy district in the northeast of the city and the location of the  |Haagse_Bos|Haagse_Bos| , a large forest. The King of the Netherlands lives in the royal palace  |Huis_ten_Bosch|Huis_Ten_Bosch| , located in this forest. The district also includes the financial centre of the city, the  |Beatrixkwartier|Beatrixkwartier| .    Laak  is the smallest district of the city, southeast of its centre, for the most part, built in the 20th and 21st century. The area used to be part of  |Rijswijk|Rijswijk| , until the municipality of The Hague bought the land in 1844. The  |Hollands_Spoor|Den_Haag_Hollands_Spoor_Railway_Station|  railway station and  |The_Hague_University|The_Hague_University|  are located here, as well as the site of the planned  |mixed-use_development|Mixed-Use_Development| |Nieuw_Binckhorst|Nieuw_Binckhorst| .    Leidschenveen-Ypenburg  is an early 21st-century  |Vinex-location|Vinex-Location|  south east of the city, geographically connected to the main body of the city  |only_by_a_narrow_corridor|Flagpole_Annexation| . The district is divided into Leidschenveen and Ypenburg, which were part of  |Leidschendam|Leidschendam| ,  |Nootdorp|Nootdorp|  and  |Rijswijk|Rijswijk|  before the areas were annexed by The Hague in 2002. This area was the site of  |Ypenburg_Airport|Ypenburg_Airport|  which was a military airport during the World War II.    Loosduinen  is the westernmost district of The Hague. It was a village unto itself until 1923, when it was annexed by The Hague. The less popular of the citys two seaside resorts,  |Kijkduin|Kijkduin|  is located here. The district is divided into four neighbourhoods.    Scheveningen  is the wealthy northernmost district of The Hague. A modern beach resort, Scheveningen is a popular tourist destination. It has a long sandy beach and its own esplanade, pier and lighthouse, but also a  |Pathé|Pathé|  cinema, a musical theatre, a casino and a special Museum for Scheveningen. The district also includes a fishing harbour. Notable buildings include the  |Kurhaus|Kurhaus_Of_Scheveningen|  and farther inland, the  |Peace_Palace|Peace_Palace| .    Segbroek  is a district located between Scheveningen and Loosduinen. The population has decreased until around 2005, but since then has begun to grow again, driven by students and east European immigrants. It became a district of The Hague in 1988 and is divided into five neighbourhoods.       The Hague experiences a temperate  |oceanic_climate|Oceanic_Climate|   similar to almost all of the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| . Because of its location on the coast, it experiences milder winters and cooler summers than more inland locations. It also gets more sunshine.                    City life concentrates around the  |Hofvijver|Hofvijver|  and the  |Binnenhof|Binnenhof| , where the States General of the Netherlands are located. Because of its history, the historical inner city of The Hague differs in various aspects from the nearby smaller cities of  |Leiden|Leiden|  and  |Delft|Delft| . It does not have a cramped inner city, bordered by canals and walls. Instead, it has some small streets in the town centre that may be dated from the late  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  and several spacious streets boasting large and luxurious 18th-century residences built for diplomats and affluent Dutch families. It has a large church dating from the 15th century, an impressive  |City_Hall|Old_City_Hall|  from the 16th century, several large 17th-century palaces, a 17th-century  |Protestant|Protestant|  church built in what was then a modern style, and many important 18th-century buildings.           The city is becoming more student friendly with the introduction of a new campus in 2012 of  |Leiden_University|Leiden_University|  as well as  |Leiden_University_College_The_Hague|Leiden_University_College_The_Hague| , which was established in 2010. The  |Royal_Conservatory_of_The_Hague|Royal_Conservatory_Of_The_Hague|  and the  |Royal_Academy_of_Art|Royal_Academy_Of_Art|  are also located there, as well as  |The_Hague_University|The_Hague_University| , a  |vocational_university|Vocational_University|  and a branch of The Open University of the Netherlands. The city has many  |civil_servants|Civil_Servant|  and  |diplomats|Diplomat|     . In fact, the number and variety of foreign residents  make the city quite culturally diverse, with many foreign  |pubs|Pub| , shops and cultural events.     The Hague is the largest Dutch city on the  |North_Sea|North_Sea|  and includes two distinct  |beach_resorts|Beach_Resort| . The main beach resort  |Scheveningen|Scheveningen| , in the northwestern part of the city is a popular destination for tourists as well as for inhabitants. With 10 million visitors a year, it is the most popular beach town in the  |Benelux|Benelux|  area.  |Kijkduin|Kijkduin| , in the south west, is The Hagues other beach resort. It is significantly smaller and attracts mainly local residents.     The former Dutch colony of the  |East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies| , now  |Indonesia|Indonesia| , has left its mark on The Hague. Since the 19th century, high level civil servants from the Dutch East Indies often spent long term leave and vacation in The Hague. Many streets are named after places in the Netherlands East Indies and there is a sizable  |Indo|Indo_People|  community. Since the loss of these Dutch possessions in December 1949,  |Indo_people|Indo_People|  also known as Indische people often refer to The Hague as the Widow of the Indies . Dutch: de Weduwe van Indie. As per song text by the famous singer  |Wieteke_van_Dort|Wieteke_Van_Dort| , see text of the song Arm Den Haag :      The older parts of the town have many characteristically wide and long streets. Houses are generally low-rise . A large part of the south western city was planned by the progressive Dutch architect  |H.P._Berlage|Hendrik_Petrus_Berlage|  about 1910. This Plan Berlage decided the spacious and homely streets for several decades. In World War II, a large amount of the western portion of The Hague was destroyed by the Germans. Afterwards, modernist architect  |W.M._Dudok|Willem_Marinus_Dudok|  planned its renewal, putting apartment blocks for the middle class in open park-like settings.     The layout of the city is more spacious than other Dutch cities and because of the incorporation of large and old nobility estates, the creation of various parks and the use of green zones around natural streams, it is a much more green city than any other in the Netherlands. That is, excepting some medieval close-knitted streets in the centre. The Hague has a canal system around the old city center, which is mainly used for boat tours around the city. Most of the canals were drained in the late 19th century but many have been restored recently.     The tallest buildings of The Hague are both 146-metre-tall ministries of  |Justice_and_Security|Ministry_Of_Justice_And_Security|  and the  |Interior_and_Kingdom_Relations|Ministry_Of_The_Interior_And_Kingdom_Relations|  of the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , designed by  |Hans_Kollhoff|Hans_Kollhoff| . Other significant skyscrapers include the  |Hoftoren|Hoftoren| ,  |Het_Strijkijzer|Het_Strijkijzer|  and  |De_Kroon|De_Kroon| .                  As of 1 January 2014, The Hague counts 509,779 inhabitants, making it the third largest city of the Netherlands. Between 1800 and 1960, the city saw a considerable growth from 40,000 in 1800 to 200,000 in 1900 and eventually 600,000 in 1960. The growth following 1900 was partially caused by the housing act of 1901, which stimulated the expansion of cities such as The Hague. In the period between 1960 and 1980, The Hague saw a shrinkage from 600,000 to 440,000 inhabitants, caused mostly by the spatial policy, demographic processes and lack of space. After several annexations and housing constructions, The Hague has since grown again, celebrating its 500,000th inhabitant in 2011. The municipality expects the growth to continue to 513,000 inhabitants in 2020.      The demonym of The Hague officially is Hagenaar, but the term Hagenees is informally used for someone who was born and raised in The Hague.  The usage of these demonyms appears to be class-bound, with Hagenaar being the upper-class term and Hagenees being that of the lower-class.        The proportion of Dutch people is 48%, while that of Western  |immigrants|Immigrants|  is 15.6%, and that of non-western immigrants is 34.4%.  .       Just under half of The Hagues population identifies with a religious group. The two most popular religions are  |Christianity|Christianity|  and Islam . Indonesian, Turks, Moroccans and Surinamese people are particularly likely to adhere to a religion. Islam is the most common religion among Turks and, particularly, among Moroccans. Surinamese people are more religiously mixed, although Hinduism is the most common. Of The Hagues native Dutch population, almost all religious people belong to Christianity. Just under 40% of the population of The Hague regularly attends a house of worship.                  As of the  |2018_municipal_election|Dutch_Municipal_Elections,_2018| , The Hagues  |municipal_council|Municipal_Council|  contains fifteen parties, most notably the local  |Group_de_Mos|Richard_De_Mos|  , the  |VVD|Peoples_Party_For_Freedom_And_Democracy|  ,  |D66|Democrats_66|  and  |GroenLinks|Groenlinks|  .         !style background-color:E9E9E9 aligncenter colspan2 Party   !style background-color:E9E9E9 alignright Seats    -    bgcolor 008f51 width2     alignleft  |Group_de_Mos_–_Heart_for_The_Hague|Richard_De_Mos| |Peoples_Party_for_Freedom_and_Democracy|Peoples_Party_For_Freedom_And_Democracy| |Democrats_66|Democrats_66| |GroenLinks|Groenlinks| |Christian_Democratic_Appeal|Christian_Democratic_Appeal| |Labour_Party|Labour_Party| |Party_for_the_Animals|Party_For_The_Animals| |Party_for_Freedom|Party_For_Freedom| |Christian_Union|Christian_Union| - |Reformed_Political_Party|Reformed_Political_Party| |Socialist_Party|Socialist_Party| |50PLUS|50Plus|     VVDboth Group de Mosboth VVDboth D66both GroenLinksRijksrechercheICJICCIRMCTPCAafter  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| 198119932002 HCCH NCI AgencyOPCWHAC |therlan|Therlan|  ISS       |[[Fishnet_stocking]]|[[Fishnet_Stocking]]| |therlan|Therlan| |therlan|Therlan| |therlan|Therlan| |therlan|Therlan| an increase of 80,000 compared to the previous yearlast update 18 July 2013 |e_Hag|E_Hag| literally Square literally Great Market  |e_Hag|E_Hag| literally Outer Court , located just outside the  |Binnenhof|Binnenhof| |e_Hag|E_Hag| formerpartially20042004200420062011 film2011 |otball_cl|Otball_Cl| a.k.a.
