In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the term almost all means all but a negligible amount . More precisely, if X is a  |set|Set| , almost all elements of X means all elements of X but those in a  |negligible|Negligible_Set| |_subset|Subset|  of X . The meaning of negligible depends on the mathematical context; for instance, it can mean  |finite|Finite_Set| ,  |countable|Countable_Set| , or  |null|Null_Set| .     In contrast, almost no means a negligible amount ; that is, almost no elements of X means a negligible amount of elements of X .            Throughout mathematics, almost all is sometimes used to mean all  but  |finite|Finite_Set| ly many . This use occurs in philosophy as well. Similarly, almost all can mean all  but  |countably|Countable_Set|  many .     Examples:   Almost all positive integers are greater than 1,000,000,000,000.  |prime_numbers|Prime_Number|  are odd .   Almost all  |polyhedra|Polyhedra|  are  |irregular|Regular_Polyhedronthe_Regular_Polyhedra|  .   If P is a  |nonzero|Zero_Polynomial|  polynomial, then P & ne; 0 for almost all x .               When speaking about the  |reals|Real_Number| , sometimes almost all can mean all reals but a  |null_set|Null_Set|  . Similarly, if S is some set of reals, almost all numbers in S can mean all numbers in S but those in a null set . The  |real_line|Real_Line|  can be thought of as a one-dimensional  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space| . In the more general case of an n -dimensional space , these definitions can be  |generalised|Generalised|  to all points but those in a null set  or all points in S but those in a null set . Even more generally, almost all is sometimes used in the sense of  |almost_everywhere|Almost_Everywhere|  in  |measure_theory|Measure_Theory| , or in the closely related sense of  |almost_surely|Almost_Surely|  in  |probability_theory|Probability_Theory| .     Examples:   In a  |measure_space|Measure_Space| , such as the real line, countable sets are null. The set of  |rational_numbers|Rational_Number|  is countable, and thus almost all real numbers are irrational.  |Georg_Cantor|Georg_Cantor|  proved in  |his_first_set_theory_article|Georg_Cantors_First_Set_Theory_Article| , the set of  |algebraic_numbers|Algebraic_Number|  is countable as well, so almost all reals are  |transcendental|Transcendental_Number| .  |normal|Normal_Number| .  |Cantor_set|Cantor_Set|  is null as well. Thus, almost all reals are not members of it even though it is uncountable.  |Cantor_function|Cantor_Function|  is 0 for almost all numbers in the  |unit_interval|Unit_Interval| . It follows from the previous example because the Cantor function is  |locally_constant|Locally_Constant_Function| , and thus has derivative 0 outside the Cantor set.          In  |number_theory|Number_Theory| , almost all positive integers can mean the positive integers in a set whose  |natural_density|Natural_Density|  is 1 . That is, if A is a set of positive integers, and if the proportion of positive integers in A below n  |tends_to|Limit_Of_A_Sequence|  1 as n tends to infinity, then almost all positive integers are in A .     More generally, let S be an infinite set of positive integers, such as the set of even positive numbers or the set of  |primes|Prime_Number| , if A is a subset of S , and if the proportion of elements of S below n that are in A tends to 1 as n tends to infinity, then it can be said that almost all elements of S are in A .     Examples:   The natural density of  |cofinite_sets|Cofinite_Set|  of positive integers is 1, so each of them contains almost all positive integers.   Almost all positive integers are  |composite|Composite_Number| .   |isolated|Twin_Primeisolated_Prime| . Moreover, for every positive integer , almost all primes have  |prime_gaps|Prime_Gap|  of more than  both to their left and to their right; that is, there is no other primes between  and .       In  |graph_theory|Graph_Theory| , if A is a set of   |graphs|Graph| , it can be said to contain almost all graphs, if the proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in A tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. However, it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities, so the definition is reformulated as follows. The proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in A equals the probability that a random graph with n vertices  is in A , and choosing a graph in this way has the same outcome as generating a graph by flipping a coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them. Therefore, equivalently to the preceding definition, the set A contains almost all graphs if the probability that a coin flip-generated graph with n vertices is in A tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. Sometimes, the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some  |other_way|Random_Graphmodels| , where not all graphs with n vertices have the same probability, and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one.     The use of the term almost all in graph theory is not standard; the term  |asymptotically_almost_surely|Asymptotically_Almost_Surely|  is more commonly used for this concept.     Example:   Almost all graphs are  |asymmetric|Asymmetric_Graph| .  |diameter|Diameter|  2.       In  |topology|Topology|  and especially  |dynamical_systems_theory|Dynamical_Systems_Theory|  , almost all of a  |topological_spaces|Topological_Space|  points can mean all of the spaces points but those in a  |meagre_set|Meagre_Set|  . Some use a more limited definition, where a subset only contains almost all of the spaces points if it contains some  |open|Open_Set| |_dense_set|Dense_Set| .     Example:   Given an  |irreducible|Hyperconnected_Space| |_algebraic_variety|Algebraic_Variety| , the  |properties|Property|  that hold for almost all points in the variety are exactly the  |generic_properties|Generic_Property| . This is due to the fact that in an irreducible algebraic variety equipped with the  |Zariski_topology|Zariski_Topology| , all nonempty open sets are dense.       In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra|  and  |mathematical_logic|Mathematical_Logic| , if U is an  |ultrafilter|Ultrafilterspecial_Case_Ultrafilter_On_The_Powerset_Of_A_Set|  on a set X , almost all elements of X sometimes means the elements of some element of U . For any  |partition|Partition_Of_A_Set|  of X into two  |disjoint|Disjoint_Sets|  sets, one of them will necessarily contain almost all elements of X . It is possible to think of the elements of a  |filter|Filter_Filter_On_A_Set|  on X as containing almost all elements of X , even if it isnt an ultrafilter.
