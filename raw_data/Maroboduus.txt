     Maroboduus , was a Romanized  |king|King|  of the  |Germanic|Germanic_Peoples| |Suebi|Suebi| , who under pressure from the wars of the  |Cherusci|Cherusci|  and Romans, and losing the Suevic  |Semnones|Semnones|  and  |Langobardi|Langobardi|  from his kingdom, moved with the  |Marcomanni|Marcomanni|  into the forests of  |Bohemia|Bohemia| , near to the  |Quadi|Quadi| .     The name Maroboduus can be broken down into two  |Celtic|Celts|  elements, māro- meaning great , and bodwos meaning raven .  ;  ;        Maroboduus was born into a noble family of the Marcomanni. As a young man, he lived in  |Italy|Italy|  and enjoyed the favour of the Emperor  |Augustus|Augustus| .  |Strabo|Strabo|   The Marcomanni had been beaten utterly by the Romans in 10 BC. About 9 BC, Maroboduus returned to  |Germania|Germania|  and became ruler of his people. To deal with the threat of  |Roman|Roman_Empire|  expansion into the  |Rhine|Rhine| - |Danube|Danube|  basin, he led the Marcomanni to the area later known as  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  to be outside the range of the Roman influence. There, he took the title of king and organized a confederation of several neighboring  |Germanic|Germanic_Peoples|  tribes. ;  |Marcus_Velleius_Paterculus|Marcus_Velleius_Paterculus| , Compendium of Roman History  He was the first documented ruler of Bohemia.     Augustus planned in 6 AD to destroy the kingdom of Maroboduus, which he considered to be too dangerous for the Romans. The future emperor  |Tiberius|Tiberius|  commanded 12 legions to attack the Marcomanni, but the outbreak of a  |revolt|Great_Illyrian_Revolt|  in  |Illyria|Illyria| , and the need for troops there, forced Tiberius to conclude a treaty with Maroboduus and to recognize him as king. Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History , 5;  |Cassius_Dio|Cassius_Dio| , Roman History 55, 28, 6-7       His rivalry with  |Arminius|Arminius| , the  |Cheruscan|Cherusci|  leader who inflicted the devastating defeat at the  |Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest|Battle_Of_The_Teutoburg_Forest|  on the Romans under  |Publius_Quinctilius_Varus|Publius_Quinctilius_Varus|  in 9 AD, prevented a concerted attack on Roman territory across the Rhine in the north and in the  |Danube|Danube|  basin in the south .     However, according to the first-century AD historian  |Marcus_Velleius_Paterculus|Marcus_Velleius_Paterculus| , Arminius sent Varuss head to Maroboduus, but the king of the Marcomanni sent it to Augustus. Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History 2, 119: caput eius abscisum latumque ad Maroboduum et ab eo missum ad Caesarem In the revenge war of Tiberius and  |Germanicus|Germanicus|  against the Cherusci, Maroboduus stayed neutral.     In 17 AD, war broke out between Arminius and Maroboduus, and after an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew into the hilly forests of Bohemia, in 18 AD.  |Tacitus|Tacitus| , Annals 2, 44-46 In the next year,  |Catualda|Catualda| , a young Marcomannic nobleman living in exile among the  |Gutones|Goths| , returned, perhaps by a subversive Roman intervention, and defeated Maroboduus. Tacitus, The Annals  |2.62|S:The_Annals_/Book_262|  The deposed king had to flee to Italy, and Tiberius detained him 18 years in  |Ravenna|Ravenna| . There, Maroboduus died in 37 AD. Tacitus, The Annals  |2.63|S:The_Annals_/Book_263|  Catualda was, in turn, defeated by the  |Hermunduri|Hermunduri| |Vibilius|Vibilius| , after which the realm was ruled by the  |Quadi|Quadi| an  |Vannius|Vannius| . Vannius was himself also deposed by Vibilius, in coordination with his nephews  |Vangio_and_Sido|Vangio_And_Sido| , who then ruled as Roman client kings.  |Tacitus|Annals| , Book 12, 27–31:  at Sacred Texts .
