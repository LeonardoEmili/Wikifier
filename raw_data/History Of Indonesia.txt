              The history of Indonesia has been shaped by its geographic position, its natural resources, a series of human migrations and contacts, wars and conquests, as well as by trade, economics and politics.  |Indonesia|Indonesia|  is an  |archipelagic|Archipelago|  country of 17,000 to 18,000 islands stretching along the equator in  |South_East_Asia|South_East_Asia| . The countrys strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade; trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history. The area of Indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations, creating a diversity of  |cultures|Culture_Of_Indonesia| ,  |ethnicities|Ethnic_Groups_Of_Indonesia| , and  |languages|Languages_Of_Indonesia| . The archipelagos landforms and climate significantly influenced agriculture and trade, and the formation of states. The boundaries of the state of Indonesia represent the 20th century borders of the  |Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies| .     Fossilised remains of  Homo erectus  and his tools, popularly known as the  |Java_Man|Java_Man|  , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited by at least 1.5 million years ago.  |Austronesian_people|Austronesian_People| , who form the majority of the modern population, are thought to have originally been from  |Taiwan|Taiwan|  and arrived in Indonesia around 2000  BCE. From the 7th century CE, the powerful  |Srivijaya|Srivijaya|  naval kingdom flourished bringing  |Hindu|Hindu|  and  |Buddhist|Buddhist|  influences with it. The agricultural Buddhist  |Sailendra|Sailendra|  and Hindu  |Mataram|Mataram_Kingdom|  dynasties subsequently thrived and declined in inland Java. The last significant non-Muslim kingdom, the Hindu  |Majapahit|Majapahit|  kingdom, flourished from the late 13th century, and its influence stretched over much of Indonesia. The  |earliest_evidence_of_Islamised_populations|Spread_Of_Islam_In_Indonesia|  in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern  |Sumatra|Sumatra| ; other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam which became the dominant religion in  |Java|Java|  and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences.     Europeans such as the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia from the 16th century seeking to monopolise the sources of valuable  |nutmeg|Nutmeg| ,  |cloves|Clove| , and  |cubeb_pepper|Cubeb|  in  |Maluku|Maluku_Islands| . In 1602 the Dutch established the  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company|  and became the dominant European power by 1610. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the  |Dutch_East_Indies|Dutch_East_Indies|  under government control. By the early 20th century, Dutch dominance extended to the current boundaries. The  |Japanese_invasion|Netherlands_East_Indies_Campaign|  and  |subsequent_occupation|Japanese_Occupation_Of_The_Dutch_East_Indies|  in 1942–45 during WWII ended Dutch rule, and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, nationalist leader,  |Sukarno|Sukarno| , declared independence and became president. The Netherlands tried to reestablish its rule, but a  |bitter_armed_and_diplomatic_struggle|Indonesian_National_Revolution|  ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure, the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence.      |An_attempted_coup|Transition_To_The_New_Order|  in 1965 led to  |a_violent_army-led_anti-communist_purge|Indonesian_Killings_Of_1965–66|  in which over half a million people were killed.  |General_Suharto|Suharto|  politically outmanoeuvred President Sukarno, and became president in March 1968. His  |New_Order_administration|New_Order|  garnered the favour of the West, whose investment in Indonesia was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth. In the late 1990s, however, Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the  |East_Asian_Financial_Crisis|East_Asian_Financial_Crisis| , which led to  |popular_protests|Indonesian_Revolution_Of_1998|  and Suhartos resignation on 21 May 1998. The  |Reformasi|Reformation|  era following Suhartos resignation, has led to a strengthening of democratic processes, including a regional autonomy program, the secession of  |East_Timor|East_Timor| , and the first  |direct_presidential_election_in_2004|2004_Indonesian_Presidential_Election| . Political and economic instability, social unrest, corruption, natural disasters, and terrorism have slowed progress. Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas.             In 2007 analysis of cut marks on two bovid bones found in  |Sangiran|Sangiran| , showed them to have been made 1.5 to 1.6 million years ago by clamshell tools. This is the oldest evidence for the presence of early man in Indonesia. Fossilised remains of  Homo erectus , popularly known as the  |Java_Man|Java_Man|  were first discovered by the Dutch anatomist  |Eugène_Dubois|Eugène_Dubois|  at  |Trinil|Trinil|  in 1891, and are at least 700,000 years old, at that time the oldest human ancestor ever found. Further H.  erectus fossils of a similar age were found at  |Sangiran|Sangiran|  in the 1930s by the  |anthropologist|Anthropologist| |Gustav_Heinrich_Ralph_von_Koenigswald|Gustav_Heinrich_Ralph_Von_Koenigswald| , who in the same time period also uncovered fossils at  |Ngandong|Ngandong|  alongside more advanced tools, re-dated in 2011 to between 550,000 and 143,000 years old.   cited in     cited in     cited in  In 1977 another H.  erectus skull was discovered at Sambungmacan.  The earliest evidence of artistic activity ever found, in the form of diagonal etchings made with a sharks tooth, was detected in 2014 on a 500,000-year-old fossil of a clam found in Java in the 1890s associated with H.  erectus.      In 2003, on the island of  |Flores|Flores| , fossils of a new small hominid dated between 74,000 and 13,000 years old and named  |Flores_Man|Flores_Man|   were discovered much to the surprise of the scientific community.   This 3 foot tall hominid is thought to be a species descended from Homo erectus and reduced in size over thousands of years by a well known process called  |island_dwarfism|Island_Dwarfism| . Flores Man seems to have shared the island with modern  Homo sapiens  until only 12,000 years ago, when they became extinct. In 2010 stone tools were discovered on Flores dating from 1 million years ago, which is the oldest evidence anywhere in the world that early man had the technology to make sea crossings at this very early time.      The archipelago was formed during the thaw after the latest  |ice_age|Quaternary_Glaciation| . Early humans travelled by sea and spread from mainland  |Asia|Asia|  eastward to  |New_Guinea|New_Guinea|  and  |Australia|Australia| .  Homo sapiens  reached the region by around 45,000 years ago.  In 2011 evidence was uncovered in neighbouring  |East_Timor|East_Timor| , showing that 42,000 years ago these early settlers had high-level maritime skills, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna.       |Austronesian_people|Austronesian_People|  form the majority of the modern population. They may have arrived in Indonesia around 2000  BCE and are thought to have originated in Taiwan.   |Dong_Son_culture|Dong_Son_Culture|  spread to Indonesia bringing with it techniques of  |wet-field_rice_cultivation|Paddy_Field| , ritual buffalo sacrifice, bronze casting,  |megalithic|Megalithic|  practises, and  |ikat|Ikat|  weaving methods. Some of these practices remain in areas including the  |Batak|Batak|  areas of Sumatra,  |Toraja|Toraja|  in Sulawesi, and several islands in  |Nusa_Tenggara|Nusa_Tenggara| . Early Indonesians were animists who honoured the spirits of the dead believing their souls or life force could still help the living.     Ideal agricultural conditions, and the mastering of  |wet-field_rice_cultivation|Paddy_Field|  as early as the 8th century BCE,  allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE. These kingdoms evolved with their own ethnic and tribal religions. Javas hot and even temperature, abundant rain and volcanic soil, was perfect for wet rice cultivation. Such agriculture required a well-organized society in contrast to  |dry-field_rice|Upland_Rice|  which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesnt require an elaborate social structure to support it.      |Buni_culture|Buni_Culture|  clay pottery flourished in coastal northern  |West_Java|West_Java|  and  |Banten|Banten|  around 400 BCE to 100 CE.  The Buni culture was probably the predecessor of the  |Tarumanagara|Tarumanagara|  kingdom, one of the earliest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia, producing numerous inscriptions and marking the beginning of the historical period in Java.         Indonesia like much of Southeast Asia was influenced by  |Indian_culture|Indian_Culture| . Becoming Indian: The Unfinished Revolution of Culture and Identity by Pavan K. Varma p.125 From the 2nd century, through the Indian dynasties like the  |Pallava|Pallava_Dynasty| ,  |Gupta|Gupta_Empire| ,  |Pala|Pala_Empire|  and  |Chola|Chola_Empire|  in the succeeding centuries up to the 12th century, Indian culture spread across all of Southeast Asia.
