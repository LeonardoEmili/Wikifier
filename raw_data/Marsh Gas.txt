Marsh gas, swamp gas, and bog gas is a mixture of  |methane|Methane| ,  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide| , and  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| , produced naturally within some geographical  |marsh|Marsh| es,  |swamps|Swamp| , and  |bogs|Bog| .     The surface of marshes, swamps, and bogs is initially  |porous|Porous_Medium|  vegetation that  |rots|Decomposition|  to form a  |crust|Soil_Crust|  that prevents  |oxygen|Oxygen|  from reaching the organic material trapped below. That is the condition that allows  |anaerobic_digestion|Anaerobic_Digestion|  and  |fermentation|Fermentation|  of any  |plant|Plant|  or  |animal|Animal|  material which incidentally also produces methane.     In some cases there is sufficient  |heat|Heat| ,  |fuel|Fuel| , and  |oxygen|Oxygen|  to allow  |spontaneous_combustion|Spontaneous_Combustion|  and underground fires to  |smolder|Smolder|  for some considerable time, as has occurred at a natural reserve in Spain.  Such fires can cause surface  |subsidence|Subsidence| , presenting an unpredictable physical hazard as well as environmental changes or damage to the local environment and the  |ecosystem|Ecosystem|.
