                   The Hebrew or Jewish calendar  is a  |lunisolar_calendar|Lunisolar_Calendar|  used today predominantly for  |Jew|Jew| ish religious observances. It determines the dates for  |Jewish_holidays|Jewish_Holiday|  and the appropriate  |public_reading|Torah_Reading|  of  |Torah_portions|Weekly_Torah_Portion| ,  yahrzeit s , and daily  |Psalm|Psalm|  readings, among many ceremonial uses. In  |Israel|Israel| , it is used for religious purposes, provides a time frame for agriculture and is an official calendar for civil purposes, although the latter usage has been steadily declining in favor of the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| .     The present Hebrew calendar is the product of evolution, including a  |Babylonian|Babylonian_Calendar|  influence. Until the  |Tannaitic|Tannaitic|  period , the calendar employed a new  |crescent_moon|Lunar_Phase| , with an additional month normally added every two or three years to correct for the difference between twelve lunar months and the solar year. The year in which it was added was based on observation of natural agriculture-related events in ancient Israel. Specifically, the ripening of the  |barley|Barley|  crop; the age of the kids, lambs, and doves; the ripeness of the fruit trees; and the relation of the date to the  . See the Talmud,  |Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin|  11b Through the  |Amoraic|Amoraic|  period and into the  |Geonic|Geonic|  period, this system was gradually displaced by the mathematical rules used today. The principles and rules were fully codified by  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  in the  in the 12th century. Maimonides work also replaced counting years since the destruction of the Temple with the modern creation-era .     The Hebrew lunar year is about eleven days shorter than the solar year and uses the 19-year  |Metonic_cycle|Metonic_Cycle|  to bring it into line with the solar year, with the addition of an  |intercalary|Intercalation|  month every two or three years, for a total of seven times per 19 years. Even with this intercalation, the average Hebrew calendar year is longer by about 6 minutes and 40 seconds than the current mean  |tropical_year|Tropical_Year| , so that every 217 years the Hebrew calendar will fall a day behind the current mean tropical year; and about every 238 years it will fall a day behind the mean Gregorian calendar year.      The era used since the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  is the   |epoch|Epoch|  . As with  , the words or abbreviation for  for the era should properly precede the date rather than follow it.     AM  began at sunset on  and will end at sunset on . This and certain other calculations in this article are now provided by a template . This template is mainly sourced from , though the information is widely available.            The Jewish day is of no fixed length. Based on the classic rabbinic interpretation of  |Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis| |1:5|Wikisource:Bible_/Torah/Bereishit/Chapter_1|  , a day in the rabbinic Hebrew calendar runs from sunset to the next sunset.  The same definition appears in the Bible in  |Leviticus|Leviticus|  23:32, where the holiday of  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur|  is defined as lasting from evening to evening . Halachically, a day ends and a new one starts when three stars are visible in the sky. The time between true sunset and the time when the three stars are visible is known as bein hashmashot, and there are differences of opinion as to which day it falls into for some uses. This may be relevant, for example, in determining the date of birth of a child born during that gap.      There is no clock in the Jewish scheme, so that the local civil clock is used. Though the civil clock, including the one in use in Israel, incorporates local adoptions of various conventions such as  |time_zones|Time_Zone| ,  |standard_times|Standard_Time|  and  |daylight_saving|Daylight_Saving| , these have no place in the Jewish scheme. The civil clock is used only as a reference point – in expressions such as: Shabbat starts at ... . The steady progression of sunset around the world and seasonal changes results in gradual civil time changes from one day to the next based on observable astronomical phenomena and not on man-made laws and conventions.     In Judaism, an hour is defined as 1/12 of the time from sunrise to sunset, so an hour can be less than 60 minutes in winter, and more than 60 minutes in summer. This proportional hour is known as a  shaah zmanit  .  |A_Jewish_hour|Biblical_And_Talmudic_Units_Of_Measurementday|  is divided into 1080 halakim  or parts. A part is 3⅓ seconds or 1 / 18 minute. The ultimate ancestor of the helek was a small Babylonian time period called a barleycorn, itself equal to 1 / 72 of a Babylonian time degree . Otto Neugebauer, The astronomy of Maimonides and its sources , Hebrew Union College Annual 23 322–363. These measures are not generally used for everyday purposes.     Instead of the  |international_date_line|International_Date_Line|  convention, there are varying opinions as to where the day changes. One opinion uses the  |antimeridian|Antimeridian|  of  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  . Other opinions exist as well. See Willie Roths essay . Appendix II: Baal HaMaors Interpretation of 20b and its Relevance to the Dateline in Talmud Bavli, Schottenstein Edition, Tractate Rosh HaShanah, Mesorah Publications Ltd. 1999, where 20b refers to the 20th page 2nd folio of the tractate.      The weekdays start with Sunday  and proceed to Saturday ,  |Shabbat|Shabbat| . Since some calculations use division, a remainder of 0 signifies Saturday.     While calculations of days, months and years are based on fixed hours equal to 1 / 24 of a day, the beginning of each halachic day is based on the local time of  |sunset|Sunset| . The end of the Shabbat and other  |Jewish_holidays|Jewish_Holiday|  is based on nightfall  which occurs some amount of time, typically 42 to 72 minutes, after sunset. According to Maimonides, nightfall occurs when three medium-sized stars become visible after sunset. By the 17th century, this had become three second-magnitude stars. The modern definition is when the center of the sun is 7° below the geometric horizon, somewhat later than civil twilight at 6°. The beginning of the daytime portion of each day is determined both by dawn and  |sunrise|Sunrise| . Most halachic times are based on some combination of these four times and vary from day to day throughout the year and also vary significantly depending on location. The daytime hours are often divided into  Shaoth Zemaniyoth  or Halachic hours by taking the time between sunrise and sunset or between dawn and nightfall and dividing it into 12 equal hours. The nighttime hours are similarly divided into 12 equal portions, albeit a different amount of time than the hours of the daytime. The earliest and latest times for  |Jewish_services|Jewish_Services| , the latest time to eat  |chametz|Chametz|  on the day before  |Passover|Passover|  and many other rules are based on Shaoth Zemaniyoth. For convenience, the modern day using Shaoth Zemaniyoth is often discussed as if sunset were at 6:00  pm, sunrise at 6:00  am and each hour were equal to a fixed hour. For example, halachic noon may be after 1:00  pm in some areas during  |daylight_saving_time|Daylight_Saving_Time| . Within the  |Mishnah|Mishnah| , however, the numbering of the hours starts with the first hour after the start of the day. See, for example, Mishna Berachot 1:2.            The Hebrew week  is a cycle of seven days, mirroring the  |seven-day_period|Creation_Week|  of the  |Book_of_Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis|  in which the world is created. Each day of the week runs from sunset to the following sunset and is figured locally. The weekly cycle, which runs concurrently with but independently of the monthly and annual cycles.       The names for the days of the week are simply the  |day_number|Ordinal_Number|  within the week, with  |Shabbat|Shabbat|  being the seventh day. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the  |numerical_value|Hebrew_Numerals|  of the Hebrew letters, for example   , meaning first day   Yom Sheni –   meaning second day   Yom Shlishi –   meaning third day   Yom Reviʻi –   meaning fourth day   Yom Chamishi –   fifth day   Yom Shishi –   meaning sixth day   Yom Shabbat –  , or more usually, simply  |Shabbat|Shabbat|  –  meaning rest day     The names of the days of the week are modeled on the seven days mentioned in the  |creation|Genesis_Creation_Myth|  story . For example,  ... And there was evening and there was morning, a second day corresponds to Yom Sheni meaning second day .     The seventh day,  |Shabbat|Shabbat| , as its Hebrew name indicates, is a day of rest in Judaism. In Talmudic Hebrew, the word Shabbat  can also mean week , For example, according to , which is based upon Prof. Yaakov Choekas  |Rav_Milim|Rav_Milim|  dictionary. But the word meaning a non-Talmudic week is שָׁבוּע , according to the same מילון מורפיקס . so that in ritual liturgy a phrase like Yom Reviʻi beShabbat means the fourth day in the week . For example, when referring to the daily psalm recited in the morning prayer .            The period from 1 Adar to 29 Marcheshvan contains all of the festivals specified in the Bible –  |Pesach|Pesach|  ,  |Shavuot|Shavuot|  ,  |Rosh_Hashanah|Rosh_Hashanah|  ,  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur|  ,  |Sukkot|Sukkot|  , and  |Shemini_Atzeret|Shemini_Atzeret|  . This period is fixed, during which no adjustments are made.        There are additional rules in the Hebrew calendar to prevent certain holidays from falling on certain days of the week.  These rules are implemented by adding an extra day to Marcheshvan or by removing one day from Kislev . Accordingly, a common Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 353, 354 or 355 days, while a leap Hebrew calendar year can have a length of 383, 384 or 385 days.       The Hebrew calendar is a  |lunisolar_calendar|Lunisolar_Calendar| , meaning that months are based on  |lunar_months|Lunar_Month| , but years are based on  |solar_years|Solar_Year| . In contrast, the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar|  is a pure  |solar_calendar|Solar_Calendar| , while the  |Islamic_calendar|Islamic_Calendar|  is a pure  |lunar_calendar|Lunar_Calendar| . The calendar year features twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty days, with an  |intercalary|Intercalation|  lunar month added periodically to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the longer solar year.  The beginning of each Jewish lunar month is based on the appearance of the  |new_moon|New_Moon| . Under the fixed, calculated calendar, this is only loosely true. Because the calculations are based on mean lunar months, not observed ones–and because of the  |Rosh_Hashanah_postponement_rules|Rosh_Hashanah_Postponement_Rules| —a given month may not begin on the same day as its astronomical conjunction. See  Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and certified by witnesses, This practice continues to be used in  |Karaite_Judaism|Karaite_Judaism|  as well as in the  |Islamic_calendar|Islamic_Calendar| . the moment of the true new moon is now approximated arithmetically as the molad, which is the mean new moon to a precision of one part.     The mean period of the lunar month  is very close to 29.5 days. Accordingly, the basic Hebrew calendar year is one of twelve lunar months alternating between 29 and 30 days:          In leap years an additional month, Adar I is added after Shevat, while the regular Adar is referred to as Adar II.       The insertion of the leap month mentioned above is based on the requirement that  |Passover|Passover| —the festival celebrating the Exodus from Egypt, which took place in the spring—always occurs in the spring season. Since the adoption of a fixed calendar, intercalations in the Hebrew calendar have been assigned to fixed points in a 19-year cycle. Prior to this, the intercalation was determined empirically. The year may be intercalated on three grounds: aviv fruits of trees, and the equinox. On two of these grounds it should be intercalated, but not on one of them alone.       |Maimonides|Maimonides| , discussing the calendrical rules in his  |Mishneh_Torah|Mishneh_Torah|  , notes: By how much does the solar year exceed the lunar year? By approximately 11 days. Therefore, whenever this excess accumulates to about 30 days, or a little more or less, one month is added and the particular year is made to consist of 13 months, and this is the so-called embolismic year. For the year could not consist of twelve months plus so-and-so many days, since it is said: throughout the months of the year , which implies that we should count the year by months and not by days.  |Mishneh_Torah|Mishneh_Torah| , Sanctification of the New Moon 1:2; quoted in   Translated from the Hebrew by Solomon Gandz; supplemented, introduced, and edited by Julian Obermann; with an astronomical commentary by Otto Neugebauer. Yale Judaica Series, Volume 11, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1956     The Bible does not directly mention the addition of embolismic or  |intercalary_months|Intercalation| . However, without the insertion of embolismic months, Jewish festivals would gradually shift outside of the  |seasons|Season|  required by the Torah. This has been ruled as implying a requirement for the insertion of embolismic months to reconcile the lunar cycles to the seasons, which are integral to solar yearly cycles.       In a regular  year, Marcheshvan has 29 days and Kislev has 30 days. However, because of the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules Kislev may lose a day to have 29 days, and the year is called a short  year, or Marcheshvan may acquire an additional day to have 30 days, and the year is called a full  year. The calendar rules have been designed to ensure that Rosh Hashanah does not fall on a Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. This is to ensure that  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur|  does not directly precede or follow  |Shabbat|Shabbat| , which would create practical difficulties, and that  |Hoshana_Rabbah|Hoshana_Rabbah|  is not on a Shabbat, in which case certain ceremonies would be lost for a year.     The 12  |lunar_months|Lunar_Months|  of the Hebrew calendar are the normal months from new moon to new moon: the year normally contains twelve months averaging 29.52 days each. The discrepancy compared to the mean  |synodic_month|Synodic_Month|  of 29.53 days is due to Adar I in a leap year always having thirty days. This means that the calendar year normally contains 354 days, roughly 11 days shorter than the solar year.     Traditionally, for the  |Babylonian|Babylonian_Calendar|  and Hebrew  |lunisolar_calendars|Lunisolar_Calendar| , the years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are the long years of the  |Metonic_cycle|Metonic_Cycle| . This cycle forms the basis of the Christian ecclesiastical calendar and the Hebrew calendar and is used for the  |computation_of_the_date_of_Easter|Computus|  each year.     During  |leap_years|Leap_Year|  Adar I  is added before the regular  |Adar|Adar| . Adar I is actually considered to be the extra month, and has 30 days. Adar II  is the real Adar, and has the usual 29 days. For this reason, holidays such as  |Purim|Purim|  are observed in Adar II, not Adar I.            The Hebrew calendar year conventionally begins on  |Rosh_Hashanah|Rosh_Hashanah| . However, other dates serve as the beginning of the year for different religious purposes.     There are three qualities that distinguish one year from another: whether it is a leap year or a common year; on which of four permissible days of the week the year begins; and whether it is a deficient, regular, or complete year. Mathematically, there are 24 possible  |combinations|Combination| , but only 14 of them are valid. Each of these patterns is called a keviyah , and is encoded as a series of two or three Hebrew letters. See  |Four_gates|Four_Gates| .     In Hebrew there are two common ways of writing the year number: with the thousands, called  , and without the thousands, called  . Thus, the current year is written as  & lrm; using the major era and  & lrm; using the minor era .             In 1178 CE,  |Maimonides|Maimonides|  wrote in the  |Mishneh_Torah|Mishneh_Torah|  Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the Moon, 11:16 that he had chosen the epoch from which calculations of all dates should be as the third day of Nisan in this present year ... which is the year 4938 of the creation of the world . Solomon, Gandz . Date of the Composition of Maimonides Code . Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 17, pp.  1–7. . . Retrieved March 14, 2013. He included all the rules for the calculated calendar and their scriptural basis, including the modern epochal year in his work, and beginning formal usage of the anno mundi era. From the eleventh century, anno mundi dating became dominant throughout most of the worlds Jewish communities.   Today, the rules detailed in Maimonides calendrical code are those generally used by Jewish communities throughout the world.     Since the codification by Maimonides in 1178, the Jewish calendar has used the  |Anno_Mundi|Anno_Mundi| |epoch|Epoch|  , sometimes referred to as the Hebrew era , to distinguish it from other systems based on some computation of creation, such as the  |Byzantine_calendar|Byzantine_Calendar| .     There is also reference in the Talmud to  |years_since_the_creation|Dating_Creation|  based on the calculation in the  Seder Olam Rabbah  of Rabbi  |Jose_ben_Halafta|Jose_Ben_Halafta|  in about 160 CE. p.107, Kantor By his calculation, based on the  |Masoretic_Text|Masoretic_Text| ,  |Adam|Adam|  was created in 3760 BCE, later confirmed by the Muslim chronologist  |al-Biruni|Al-Biruni|  as 3448 years before the  |Seleucid_era|Seleucid_Era| . See  The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries . An example is the c. 8th century  |Baraita_of_Samuel|Baraita_Of_Samuel| .     According to rabbinic reckoning, the beginning of year 1 is not  |Creation|Creation_According_To_Genesis| , but about one year before Creation, with the new moon of its first month to be called molad tohu . The Jewish calendars epoch , 1 Tishrei AM 1, is equivalent to Monday, 7 October 3761 BCE in the  |proleptic_Julian_calendar|Proleptic_Julian_Calendar| , the equivalent tabular date and is about one year before the traditional Jewish  |date_of_Creation|Dating_Creation|  on 25 Elul AM 1, The significance of 25 Elul derives from Adam and Eve being created on the sixth day of creation, 1 Tishrei AM 2. In this view, AM 2 is the actual first year of the world, while AM 1 is a placeholder year, so that calendar dates can be assigned to the days of creation. based upon the Seder Olam Rabbah. A minority opinion places Creation on 25 Adar AM 1, six months earlier, or six months after the modern epoch. Thus, adding 3760 before  |Rosh_Hashanah|Rosh_Hashanah|  or 3761 after to a  |Julian|Julian_Calendar|  year number starting from 1 CE will yield the Hebrew year. For earlier years there may be a discrepancy see:  |Missing_years|Missing_Years| .     The Seder Olam Rabbah also recognized the importance of the  |Jubilee|Jubilee|  and  |Sabbatical|Shmita|  cycles as a long-term calendrical system, and attempted at various places to fit the Sabbatical and Jubilee years into its chronological scheme.     Occasionally, Anno Mundi is styled as Anno Hebraico ,  though this is subject to confusion with notation for the Islamic  |Hijri_year|Hijri_Year| .            The Jewish calendar has several distinct new years, used for different purposes. The use of multiple starting dates for a year is comparable to different starting dates for civil calendar years , tax or  |fiscal_years|Fiscal_Year|  ,  |academic_years|Academic_Year|  , and so on. The  Mishnah  identifies four new-year dates:     The 1st of Nisan is the new year for kings and festivals; the 1st of Elul is the new year for the  |cattle_tithe|Cattle_Tithe| ... the 1st of Tishri is the new year for years, of the  |years_of_release|Shmita|  and  |jubilee_years|Jubilee| , for the planting and for vegetables; and the 1st of  |Shevat|Shevat|  is the new year for trees—so the school of Shammai; and the school of Hillel say: On the  |15th_thereof|Tu_Bishvat| .  |Rosh_Hashanah_1:1|S:Translation:Mishnah/Seder_Moed/Tractate_Rosh_Hashanah/Chapter_1/1|      Two of these dates are especially prominent:   1 Nisan is the ecclesiastical new year, i.e. the date from which months and festivals are counted.  set Aviv  as the first of months : this month shall be unto you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you. Thus  |Passover|Passover|  is described in the Torah as falling in the first month ,  while  |Rosh_Hashana|Rosh_Hashana|  is described as falling in the seventh month .  Since Passover is required to be celebrated in the spring, it should fall around, and normally just after, the  |vernal_equinox|Equinox| . If the twelfth full moon after the previous Passover is too early compared to the equinox, a 13th leap month is inserted near the end of the previous year before the new year is set to begin. According to normative Judaism, the verses in  require that the months be determined by a proper court with the necessary authority to sanctify the months. Hence the court, not the astronomy, has the final decision.      Nowadays, the day most commonly referred to as the New Year is 1 Tishrei , even though Tishrei is the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. 1 Tishrei is the civil new year, and the date on which the year number advances. Tishrei marks the end of one agricultural year and the beginning of another, ,  and thus 1 Tishrei is considered the new year for most agriculture-related commandments, including  |Shmita|Shmita| ,  |Yovel|Jubilee| ,  |Maaser_Rishon|Maaser_Rishon| ,  |Maaser_Sheni|Maaser_Sheni| , and  |Maaser_Ani|Maaser_Ani| .     For the dates of the Jewish New Year see  |Jewish_and_Israeli_holidays_2000–2050|Jewish_And_Israeli_Holidays_2000–2050|  or calculate using the section Conversion between Jewish and civil calendars .       The Jewish calendar is based on the  |Metonic_cycle|Metonic_Cycle|  of 19 years, of which 12 are common years of 12 months and 7 are leap years of 13 months. To determine whether a Jewish year is a leap year, one must find its position in the 19-year Metonic cycle. This position is calculated by dividing the Jewish year number by 19 and finding the  |remainder|Remainder| . For example, the Jewish year  divided by 19 results in a remainder of , indicating that it is year  of the Metonic cycle. See also  |Golden_number|Golden_Number| .     Years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 of the Metonic cycle are leap years. To assist in remembering this sequence, some people use the mnemonic Hebrew word GUCHADZaT , where the Hebrew letters gimel-vav-het aleph-dalet-zayin-tet are used as  |Hebrew_numerals|Hebrew_Numerals|  equivalent to 3, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 9. The keviyah records whether the year is leap or common: פ for peshuta , meaning simple and indicating a common year, and מ indicating a leap year .      Another memory aid notes that intervals of the  |major_scale|Major_Scale|  follow the same pattern as do Jewish leap years, with do corresponding to year 19 : a  |whole_step|Whole_Step|  in the scale corresponds to two common years between consecutive leap years, and a  |half_step|Half_Step|  to one common year between two leap years. This connection with the major scale is more plain in the context of  |19_equal_temperament|19_Equal_Temperament| n of the calendar is a leap year, find the remainder on dividing   +  1 by 19. If the remainder is 6 or less it is a leap year; if it is 7 or more it is not. For example, the  The   This works because as there are seven leap years in nineteen years the difference between the solar and lunar years increases by 7/19-month per year. When the difference goes above 18/19-month this signifies a leap year, and the difference is reduced by one month.            To calculate the day on which Rosh Hashanah of a given year will fall, it is necessary first to calculate the expected  |molad|Molad|   of Tishrei in that year, and then to apply a set of rules to determine whether the first day of the year must be postponed. The molad can be calculated by multiplying the number of months that will have elapsed since some molad whose weekday is known by the mean length of a lunar month, which is 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 parts . The very first molad, the  |molad_tohu|Epoch| , fell on Sunday evening at 11.11 in the local time of  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|   , or -3761/10/6  20:50:23.1  |UTC|Coordinated_Universal_Time| , or in Jewish terms Day 2, 5 hours, and 204 parts.     In calculating the number of months that will have passed since the known molad that one uses as the starting point, one must remember to include any leap months that falls within the elapsed interval, according to the cycle of leap years. A 19-year cycle of 235 synodic months has 991 weeks 2 days 16 hours 595 parts, a common year of 12 synodic months has 50 weeks 4 days 8 hours 876 parts, while a leap year of 13 synodic months has 54 weeks 5 days 21 hours 589 parts.     The two months whose numbers of days may be adjusted, Marcheshvan and Kislev, are the eighth and ninth months of the Hebrew year, whereas Tishrei is the seventh month . Any adjustments needed to postpone Rosh Hashanah must be made to the adjustable months in the year that precedes the year of which the Rosh Hashanah will be the first day.     Just four potential conditions are considered to determine whether the date of Rosh Hashanah must be postponed. These are called the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, or deḥiyyot       If the molad occurs at or later than noon, Rosh Hashanah is postponed a day. This is called deḥiyyat molad zaken .   If the molad occurs on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, Rosh Hashanah is postponed a day. If the application of deḥiyyah molad zaken would place Rosh Hashanah on one of these days, then it must be postponed a second day. This is called deḥiyyat lo ADU , an acronym that means not one, four, or six.     The first of these rules  is referred to in the Talmud. Nowadays, molad zaken is used as a device to prevent the molad falling on the second day of the month. The second rule, , is applied for religious reasons.     Another two rules are applied much less frequently and serve to prevent impermissible year lengths. Their names are Hebrew acronyms that refer to the ways they are calculated:     If the molad in a common year falls on a Tuesday after 9 hours and 204 parts, Rosh Hashanah is postponed to Thursday. This is deḥiyyat GaTaRaD .
