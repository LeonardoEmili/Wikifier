      Materialism is a form of  |philosophical_monism|Monism|  that holds that  |matter|Matter|  is the fundamental  |substance|Substance_Theory|  in  |nature|Nature| , and that all things, including  |mental_states|Mind|  and  |consciousness|Consciousness| , are results of material interactions. According to philosophical materialism, mind and consciousness are  |by_products|By_Product|  or  |epiphenomena|Epiphenominalism|  of material processes , without which they cannot exist. This concept directly contrasts with  |idealism|Idealism| , where  |mind|Mind|  and  |consciousness|Consciousness|  are first-order realities to which matter is subject and material interactions are secondary.     Materialism is closely related to  |physicalism|Physicalism| —the view that all that exists is ultimately physical. Philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the theories of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter . Thus the term physicalism is preferred over materialism by some, while others use the terms as if they are  |synonym|Synonym| ous.     Philosophies contradictory to materialism or physicalism include  |idealism|Idealism| ,  |pluralism|Pluralism| ,  |dualism|Dualism| , and other forms of  |monism|Monism| .          Materialism belongs to the class of  |monist|Monism| |_ontology|Ontology| . As such, it is different from ontological theories based on  |dualism|Dualism|  or  |pluralism|Pluralism| . For singular explanations of the phenomenal reality, materialism would be in contrast to  |idealism|Idealism| ,  |neutral_monism|Neutral_Monism|  and  |spiritualism|Spiritualism| .     Despite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many,  Alternative   Alternative   all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: idealism and materialism. The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality—the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions: what does reality consist of? and how does it originate? To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind are primary, and matter secondary. To materialists, matter is primary, and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary—the product of matter acting upon matter.     The materialist view is perhaps best understood in its opposition to the doctrines of immaterial substance applied to the mind historically by  |René_Descartes|René_Descartes| ; however, by itself materialism says nothing about how material substance should be characterized. In practice, it is frequently assimilated to one variety of  |physicalism|Physicalism|  or another.     Materialism is often associated with  |reductionism|Reduction| , according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description, if they are genuine, must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description—typically, at a more reduced level. Non-reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion, however, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents.  |Jerry_Fodor|Jerry_Fodor|  argues this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in special sciences like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics.     Modern philosophical materialists extend the definition of other scientifically observable entities such as  |energy|Energy| ,  |forces|Force|  and the  |curvature_of_space|Curvature_Of_Space| ; however, philosophers such as  |Mary_Midgley|Mary_Midgley|  suggest that the concept of matter is elusive and poorly defined.  |Mary_Midgley|Mary_Midgley|  The Myths We Live By.     Materialism typically contrasts with  |dualism|Dualism| ,  |phenomenalism|Phenomenalism| ,  |idealism|Idealism| ,  |vitalism|Vitalism|  and  |dual_aspect_monism|Dual_Aspect_Monism| . Its materiality can, in some ways, be linked to the concept of  |determinism|Determinism| , as espoused by  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  thinkers.     During the nineteenth century,  |Karl_Marx|Karl_Marx|  and  |Friedrich_Engels|Friedrich_Engels|  extended the concept of materialism to elaborate a materialist conception of history centered on the roughly empirical world of human activity and the  |institutions|Institution|  created, reproduced or destroyed by that activity . They also developed  |dialectical_materialism|Dialectical_Materialism| , through taking  |Hegelian_dialectics|Hegelian_Dialectics| , stripping them of their idealist aspects and fusing them with materialism Capital Vol. 1, . .              Materialism developed, possibly independently, in several geographically separated regions of  |Eurasia|Eurasia|  during what  |Karl_Jaspers|Karl_Jaspers|  termed the  |Axial_Age|Axial_Age|  .     In  |ancient_Indian_philosophy|Ancient_Indian_Philosophy| , materialism developed around 600  BC with the works of  |Ajita_Kesakambali|Ajita_Kesakambali| ,  |Payasi|Payasi| ,  |Kanada|Kanada|  and the proponents of the  |Cārvāka|Cārvāka|  school of philosophy. Kanada became one of the early proponents of  |atomism|Atomism| . The  |Nyaya|Nyaya| – |Vaisesika|Vaisesika|  school developed one of the earliest forms of atomism .  |Buddhist_atomism|Buddhist_Atomism|  and the  |Jaina|Jainism|  school continued the atomic tradition.      |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek_Philosophy| |_atomists|Atomists|  like  |Leucippus|Leucippus| ,  |Democritus|Democritus|  and  |Epicurus|Epicurus|  prefigure later materialists. The Latin poem  De Rerum Natura  by  |Lucretius|Lucretius|  reflects the  |mechanistic|Mechanism|  philosophy of Democritus and Epicurus. According to this view, all that exists is matter and void, and all phenomena result from different motions and conglomerations of base material particles called atoms . De Rerum Natura provides mechanistic explanations for phenomena such as erosion, evaporation, wind and sound. Famous principles like nothing can touch body but body first appeared in the works of Lucretius. Democritus and Epicurus, however, did not hold to a monist ontology since they held to the ontological separation of matter and space indicating that the definition of materialism is wider than the given scope of this article.        |Wang_Chong|Wang_Chong|  was a Chinese thinker of the early  |Common_Era|Common_Era|  said to be a materialist.      Later Indian materialist  |Jayaraashi_Bhatta|Jayaraashi_Bhatta|  in his work Tattvopaplavasimha refuted the  |Nyaya_Sutra|Nyaya_Sutra|  epistemology. The materialistic  |Cārvāka|Cārvāka|  philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1400; when  |Madhavacharya|Madhavacharya_Of_Sringeri|  compiled Sarva-darśana-samgraha in the 14th century, he had no Cārvāka/Lokāyata text to quote from or refer to. , Ramakrishna Bhattacharya     In early 12th-century  |al_Andalus|Al_Andalus| , the  |Arabian_philosopher|Early_Islamic_Philosophy| ,  |Ibn_Tufail|Ibn_Tufail|  , wrote discussions on materialism in his  |philosophical_novel|Philosophical_Novel| ,  Hayy ibn Yaqdhan  , while vaguely foreshadowing the idea of a  |historical_materialism|Historical_Materialism| .

There followed the materialist and  |atheist|Atheism|  abbé  |Jean_Meslier|Jean_Meslier|  and the works of the  |French_materialists|French_Materialism| |Julien_Offray_de_La_Mettrie|Julien_Offray_De_La_Mettrie| , the German-French  |Baron_dHolbach|Baron_Dholbach|  ,  |Denis_Diderot|Denis_Diderot|  and other French  |Enlightenment|The_Enlightenment|  thinkers. In England,  |John_Walking_Stewart|John_Walking_Stewart|  insisted on seeing matter as endowed with a  |moral|Moral|  dimension, which had a major impact on the philosophical poetry of  |William_Wordsworth|William_Wordsworth|  .     In  |late_modern_philosophy|Late_Modern_Philosophy| , German atheist  |anthropologist|Anthropologist| |_Ludwig_Feuerbach|Ludwig_Feuerbach|  would signal a new turn in materialism through his book  The Essence of Christianity  , which presented a  |humanist|Humanism|  account of religion as the outward projection of mans inward nature. Feuerbachs anthropological materialism  |Axel_Honneth|Axel_Honneth| ,  |Hans_Joas|Hans_Joas| , Social Action and Human Nature, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 18.  would later heavily influence  |Karl_Marx|Karl_Marx| , Nicholas Churchich, Marxism and Alienation, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: Although Marx has rejected Feuerbachs abstract materialism, Lenin says that Feuerbachs views are consistently materialist, implying that Feuerbachs conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism. who in the late 19th century elaborated the concept of  |historical_materialism|Historical_Materialism| —the basis for what Marx and  |Friedrich_Engels|Friedrich_Engels|  outlined as  |scientific_socialism|Scientific_Socialism|      Engels later developed a materialist dialectic  |philosophy_of_nature|Philosophy_Of_Nature|  .

In early 20th-century  |Russian_philosophy|Russian_Philosophy| ,  |Vladimir_Lenin|Vladimir_Lenin|  further developed dialectical materialism in his book  Materialism and Empirio-criticism  , which connected the political conceptions put forth by his opponents to their anti-materialist philosophies.     A more  |naturalist|Metaphysical_Naturalism| -oriented materialist school of thought that developed in the middle of the 19th century was German materialism |Ludwig_Büchner|Ludwig_Büchner| ,  |Jacob_Moleschott|Jacob_Moleschott|  and  |Karl_Vogt|Karl_Vogt| .

In the early twenty-first century,  |Paul|Paul_Churchland|  and  |Patricia_Churchland|Patricia_Churchland|  advocated a radically contrasting position ;  |eliminativist_materialism|Eliminativist_Materialism|  holds that some mental phenomena simply do not exist at all, and that talk of those mental phenomena reflects a totally spurious  |folk_psychology|Folk_Psychology|  and  |introspection_illusion|Introspection_Illusion| . An eliminative materialist might believe that a concept like belief simply has no basis in fact . With reductive materialism being at one end of a continuum  and eliminative materialism on the other ,  |revisionary_materialism|Revisionary_Materialism|  is somewhere in the middle.           |Contemporary|Contemporary_Philosophy| |_continental_philosopher|Continental_Philosopher| |_Gilles_Deleuze|Gilles_Deleuze|  has attempted to rework and strengthen classical materialist ideas.  Contemporary theorists such as  |Manuel_DeLanda|Manuel_Delanda| , working with this reinvigorated materialism, have come to be classified as new materialist in persuasion.  New materialism has now become its own specialized subfield of knowledge, with courses being offered on the topic at major universities, as well as numerous conferences, edited collections and monographs devoted to it.  |Jane_Bennetts|Jane_Bennett|  book Vibrant Matter has been particularly instrumental in bringing theories of monist ontology and vitalism back into a critical theoretical fold dominated by  |poststructuralist|Poststructuralist|  theories of language and discourse.  Scholars such as Mel Y. Chen and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, however, have critiqued this body of new materialist literature for its neglect in considering the materiality of race and gender in particular.   Other scholars such as Hélene Vosters have questioned whether there is anything particularly new about this so-called new materialism , as Indigenous and other animist ontologies have attested to what might be called the vibrancy of matter for centuries.  Other scholars such as  |Thomas_Nail|Thomas_Nail|  have critiqued vitalist versions of new materialism for its depoliticizing flat ontology and for being ahistorical in nature.        |Quentin_Meillassoux|Quentin_Meillassoux|  proposed  |speculative_materialism|Speculative_Materialism| , a  |post_Kantian|Post_Kantian|  return to David Hume which is also based on materialist ideas.  |Quentin_Meillassoux|Quentin_Meillassoux|  , After Finitude, Bloomsbury, p. 90.       The nature and definition of matter—like other key concepts in science and philosophy—have occasioned much debate.  Is there a single kind of matter  which everything is made of, or multiple kinds? Is matter a continuous substance capable of expressing multiple forms   Concise Britannica or a number of discrete, unchanging constituents ?   Dictionary of the History of Ideas  Dictionary of the History of Ideas               Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Does it have intrinsic properties    or is it lacking them ?     One challenge to the traditional concept of matter as tangible stuff came with the rise of  |field_physics|Field_Physics|  in the 19th century.  |Relativity|Special_Relativity|  shows that matter and energy are interchangeable. This enables the ontological view that energy is prima materia and matter is one of its forms. On the other hand, the  |Standard_Model|Standard_Model|  of particle physics uses  |quantum_field_theory|Quantum_Field_Theory|  to describe all interactions. On this view it could be said that fields are prima materia and the energy is a property of the field.     According to the dominant cosmological model, the  |Lambda_CDM_model|Lambda_Cdm_Model| , less than 5% of the universes energy density is made up of the matter described by the Standard Model, and the majority of the universe is composed of  |dark_matter|Dark_Matter|  and  |dark_energy|Dark_Energy| , with little agreement among scientists about what these are made of. Bernard Sadoulet Particle Dark Matter in the Universe: At the Brink of Discovery? Science 5 January 2007: Vol. 315. no. 5808, pp. 61 - 63     With the advent of quantum physics, some scientists believed the concept of matter had merely changed, while others believed the conventional position could no longer be maintained. For instance  |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg|  said, The ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct actuality of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible... atoms are not things.  Likewise, some philosophers feel that these dichotomies necessitate a switch from materialism to physicalism. Others use the terms materialism and physicalism interchangeably.  Dictionary of the Philosophy of Mind     The concept of matter has changed in response to new scientific discoveries. Thus materialism has no definite content independent of the particular theory of matter on which it is based. According to  |Noam_Chomsky|Noam_Chomsky| , any  |property|Property|  can be considered material, if one defines matter such that it has that property. Chomsky, Noam New Horizons in the Study of Language and Mind       George Stack distinguishes between materialism and physicalism:    However, not all conceptions of physicalism are tied to verificationist theories of meaning or direct realist accounts of perception. Rather, physicalists believe that no “element of reality” is missing from the mathematical formalism of our best description of the world. “Materialist” physicalists also believe that the formalism describes fields of insentience. In other words, the intrinsic nature of the physical is non-experiential.               |Rudolf_Peierls|Rudolf_Peierls| , a physicist who played a major role in the  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project| , rejected materialism, saying, The premise that you can describe in terms of physics the whole function of a human being including knowledge and consciousness, is untenable. There is still something missing .       |Erwin_Schrödinger|Erwin_Schrödinger|  said, Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else . General Scientific and Popular Papers, in Collected Papers, Vol. 4. Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences. Friedr. Vieweg & Sohn, Braunschweig/Wiesbaden. p. 334      |Werner_Heisenberg|Werner_Heisenberg| , who came up with the  |uncertainty_principle|Uncertainty_Principle| , wrote, The  |ontology|Ontology|  of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence, the direct ‘actuality’ of the world around us, can be extrapolated into the atomic range. This extrapolation, however, is impossible…Atoms are not things . W. Heisenberg . Physics and philosophy: the revolution in modern science       Some 20th-century physicists  Quantum interactive dualism - an alternative to materialism,  Journal of Consciousness Studies  and modern day physicists and science writers  have argued that materialism is flawed due to certain recent scientific findings in physics, such as  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics|  and  |chaos_theory|Chaos_Theory| . In 1991, Gribbin and Davies released their book The Matter Myth, the first chapter of which, The Death of Materialism , contained the following passage:            The objections of Davies and Gribbin are shared by proponents of  |digital_physics|Digital_Physics|  who view information rather than matter to be fundamental.

Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter . James Jeans, The Mysterious Universe p. 137, 1937 ed.       According to Constantin Gutberlet writing in  Catholic Encyclopedia  , materialism, defined as a philosophical system which regards matter as the only reality in the world denies the existence of God and the soul .  In this view, materialism could be perceived incompatible with world religions that ascribe existence to immaterial objects.  Materialism could be conflated with atheism. However, Friedrich Lange wrote in 1892, Diderot has not always in the Encyclop & aelig;dia expressed his own individual opinion, but it is just as true that at its commencement he had not yet got as far as Atheism and Materialism .      Most of  |Hinduism|Hinduism|  and  |transcendentalism|Transcendentalism|  regard all matter as an illusion called  |Maya|Maya| , blinding humans from knowing the truth. Transcendental experiences like the perception of  |Brahman|Brahman|  are considered to destroy the illusion.       |Joseph_Smith|Joseph_Smith| , the founder of the  |Latter_Day_Saint_movement|Latter_Day_Saint_Movement| , taught: There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter.  |Doctrine_and_Covenants|Doctrine_And_Covenants|   This spirit element is believed to always have existed and to be co-eternal with God. .     Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science movement, denied the existence of matter on the basis of the allness of Mind . Mary Baker Eddy, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Boston: The First Church of Christ Scientist, 1934, p. 468.       In the  Critique of Pure Reason ,  |Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel_Kant|  argued against materialism in defending his  |transcendental_idealism|Transcendental_Idealism|  . See  Critique of Pure Reason  where he gives a refutation of idealism in pp. 345–52 and pp. 244–7 in the Norman Kemp Smith edition  Critique of Pure Reason  .     If, however, as commonly happens, we seek to extend the concept of dualism, and take it in the transcendental sense, neither it nor the two counter-alternatives — pneumatism on the one hand, materialism on the other — would have any sort of basis Neither the transcendental object which underlies outer appearances nor that which underlies inner intuition, is in itself either matter or a thinking being, but a ground ... However, Kant with his refutation of idealism, argues that change and time require an enduring substrate. Kant argues that we can determine that there has been a change in the objects of our perception, not merely a change in our perceptions themselves, only by conceiving of what we perceive as successive states of enduring substances .  All determination of time presupposes something permanent in perception. This permanent cannot, however, be something in me Critique of Pure Reason, B274, p. 245  |Postmodern|Postmodern| / |poststructuralist|Poststructuralist|  thinkers also express a skepticism about any all-encompassing metaphysical scheme. Philosopher  |Mary_Midgley|Mary_Midgley|  argues that materialism is a  |self_refuting_idea|Self_Refuting_Idea| , at least in its  |eliminative_materialist|Eliminative_Materialism|  form.

Arguments for  |idealism|Idealism| , such as those of  |Hegel|Hegel|  and  |Berkeley|George_Berkeley| , often take the form of an argument against materialism; indeed, the idealism of Berkeley was called immaterialism. Now, matter can be argued to be redundant, as in  |bundle_theory|Bundle_Theory| , and mind-independent properties can, in turn, be reduced to subjective  |percepts|Percept| . Berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter, as there is no direct experience of matter; all that is experienced is perception, whether internal or external. As such, the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent stability of perceptions; it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience.     If matter and energy are seen as necessary to explain the physical world, but incapable of explaining mind,  |dualism|Dualism|  results.  |Emergence|Emergence| ,  |holism|Holism|  and  |process_philosophy|Process_Philosophy|  seek to ameliorate the perceived shortcomings of traditional  materialism without abandoning materialism entirely.       Some critics object to materialism as part of an overly skeptical, narrow or  |reductivist|Reductionism|  approach to theorizing, rather than to the ontological claim that matter is the only substance.    |Particle_physicist|Particle_Physics|  and Anglican  |theologian|Theology| |_John_Polkinghorne|John_Polkinghorne|  objects to what he calls promissory materialism—claims that materialistic science will eventually succeed in explaining phenomena it has not so far been able to explain. However, critics of materialism are equally guilty of prognosticating that it will never be able to explain certain phenomena. Over a hundred years ago  |William_James|William_James|  saw clearly that science would never resolve the  |mind_body_problem|Mind_Body_Dichotomy| .  Dembski, W. Polkinghorne prefers  |dual_aspect_monism|Dual_Aspect_Monism|  to materialism.      Some scientific materialists have been criticized for failing to provide clear definitions for what constitutes matter, leaving the term materialism without any definite meaning.  |Noam_Chomsky|Noam_Chomsky| .
