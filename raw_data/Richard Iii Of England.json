The date of Pastons letter suggests the marriage was still being negotiated in February 1472. In order to win his brother Georges final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of Warwicks land and property including the earldoms of Warwick and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England. Richard retained Nevilles forfeit estates he had already been granted in the summer of 1471:  Penrith, Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, where he later established his marital household.

    {
        " has suggested that the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following Georges marriage to Annes sister Isabel. First-degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brothers widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case, the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richards case, there would have been first-degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richards marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.     In June 1473, Richard persuaded his mother-in-law to leave the sanctuary and come to live under his protection at Middleham. Later in the year, under the terms of the 1473 Act of Resumption, George lost some of the property he held under royal grant and made no secret of his displeasure. John Pastons letter of November 1473 says that the king planned to put both his younger brothers in their place by acting as a stifler atween them .     Early in 1474, Parliament assembled and King Edward attempted to reconcile his brothers by stating that both men, and their wives, would enjoy the Warwick inheritance just as if the Countess of Warwick was naturally dead . The doubts cast by Clarence on the validity of Richard and Annes marriage were addressed by a clause protecting their rights in the event they were divorced and then legally remarried to each other, and also protected Richards rights while waiting for such a valid second marriage with Anne.

Forensic pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton stated that this injury would have left the individuals brain visible, and most certainly would have been the cause of death. Dr Jo Appleby, the osteo-archaeologist who excavated the skeleton, concurred and described the latter as a mortal battlefield wound in the back of the skull . The base of the skull also presented another fatal wound in which a bladed weapon had been thrust into it, leaving behind a jagged hole. Closer examination of the interior of the skull revealed a mark opposite this wound, showing that the blade penetrated to a depth of .  In total, the skeleton presented ten wounds: four minor injuries on the top of the skull, one dagger blow on the cheekbone, one cut on the lower jaw, two fatal injuries on the base of the skull, one cut on a rib bone, and one final wound on the pelvis, most probably inflicted after death. It is generally accepted that postmortem, Richards naked body was tied to the back of a horse, with his arms slung over one side and his legs and buttocks over the other. This presented a tempting target for onlookers, and the angle of the blow on the pelvis suggests that one of them stabbed Richards right buttock with substantial force, as the cut extends from the back all the way to the front of the pelvic bone and was most probably an act of humiliation. It is also possible that Richard suffered other injuries which left no trace on the skeleton.        British historian John Ashdown-Hill had used ": null

This conclusion was based on mitochondrial DNA evidence, soil analysis, and dental tests , as well as physical characteristics of the skeleton which are highly consistent with contemporary accounts of Richards appearance.  The team announced that the arrowhead discovered with the body was a Roman-era nail, probably disturbed when the body was first interred. However, there were numerous perimortem wounds on the body, and part of the skull had been sliced off with a bladed weapon; this would have caused rapid death.

However, Michael Ibsen, who gave the DNA sample that identified the king, gave his support to Leicesters claim to re-inter the body in their cathedral. On 20 August, a judge ruled that the opponents had the legal standing to contest his burial in Leicester Cathedral, despite a clause in the contract which had authorized the excavations requiring his burial there. He urged the parties, though, to settle out of court in order to avoid embarking on the Wars of the Roses, Part Two .
