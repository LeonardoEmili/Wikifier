   The Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg  was an  |ecclesiastical_principality|Hochstift|  of the Holy Roman Empire from the 12th century until it was secularized during the second half of the 16th century. It should not be confused with the larger Diocese of Brandenburg  established by King  |Otto_I_of_Germany|Otto_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in 948, in the territory of the  Marca Geronis   east of the  |Elbe|Elbe|  river. The diocese, over which the prince-bishop exercised only spiritual authority, was a  |suffragan_diocese|Suffragan_Diocese|  of the Archdiocese of Magdeburg, its seat was  |Brandenburg_an_der_Havel|Brandenburg_An_Der_Havel| .     The Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg was an  |imperial_estate|Imperial_State|  of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  for some time, probably starting about 1161/1165. However, the Brandenburg bishops never managed to gain control over a significant territory, being overshadowed by the  |Margraviate_of_Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg| , which was originally seated in the same city. Chapter and cathedral, surrounded by further ecclesiastical institutions, were located on the Dominsel , which formed a prince-episcopal  |cathedral_immunity_district|Domfreiheit|  , distinct from the city of Brandenburg. Only in 1929 the - meanwhile former - immunity district was incorporated into the city itself.          The foundation charter of the Brandenburg diocese is dated 1 October 948, though the actual founding date remained disputed among historians. The medieval chronicler  |Thietmar_of_Merseburg|Thietmar_Of_Merseburg|  mentions the year 938; the bishopric may also have been established in the course of the partition of the vast Marca Geronis and the emergence of the  |Northern_March|Northern_March|  after Margrave  |Geros|Gero|  death in 965. With the foundation, King Otto  aimed at the  |Christianization|Christianization|  of the  |Polabian_Slavs|Polabian_Slavs|   and the incorporation of their territory into the  |East_Frankish|East_Francia|  realm.     Brandenburg was originally a suffragan of the  |Archbishopric_of_Mainz|Archbishopric_Of_Mainz| , but in 968 it came under the jurisdiction of the Magdeburg archbishops. The  |Great_Slav_Rising|Great_Slav_Rising|  of 983 practically annihilated it, when revolting  |Lutici|Lutici|  tribes conquered Brandenburg and the neighbouring  |Bishopric_of_Havelberg|Bishopric_Of_Havelberg| . Brandenburg bishops continued to be appointed, but they were merely titular, residing in Magdeburg or acting as  |auxiliary_bishops|Auxiliary_Bishop|  in the western territories of the Empire. Not until the final subjugation of the Wends in the 12th century by Margrave  |Albert_the_Bear|Albert_The_Bear| , the  |German_eastward_settlement|Ostsiedlung|   in the diocesan region revived the bishopric.     Bishop Wigers of Brandenburg , an adherent of  |Norbert_of_Xanten|Norbert_Of_Xanten| , was the first of a series of bishops of the  |Premonstratensian|Premonstratensians|  Order, which chose the occupants of the  |episcopal_see|Episcopal_See|  until 1447; in that year a bull of  |Pope_Nicholas_V|Pope_Nicholas_V|  gave the right of nomination to the Brandenburg  |elector|Prince-Elector| , with whom the bishops stood in a close feudal relation. Bishop Wigers also established a Premonstratensian convent at  |Leitzkau|Gommern|  . Probably at the request of the  |Hevelli|Hevelli| an prince  |Pribislav-Henry|Pribislav-Henry| , he established another convent at the Slavic Parduin settlement in present-day Brandenburg an der Havel, which became the nucleus of the revived Brandenburg cathedral chapter. The incorporation into the Premonstratensian Order was confirmed by  |Pope_Clement_III|Pope_Clement_Iii|  in 1188.      As rulers of  |imperial_immediacy|Imperial_Immediacy| , regnant in a, however, dispersed territory partitioned into the four bailiwicks  of Brandenburg/Havel,  |Ketzin|Ketzin| ,  |Teltow|Teltow|  and  |Ziesar|Ziesar| . The prince-bishops from the early 14th century onwards resided in their fortress in Ziesar on the road to  |Magdeburg|Magdeburg| . The last actual bishop was  |Matthias_von_Jagow|Matthias_Von_Jagow|  , who took the side of the  |Protestant_Reformation|Protestant_Reformation| , married, and in every way furthered the undertakings of the  |Hohenzollern|House_Of_Hohenzollern|  elector  |Joachim_II|Joachim_Ii_Hector,_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| .     There were two more nominal bishops, but on the petition of the latter of these, the electoral prince  |John_George_of_Brandenburg|John_George,_Elector_Of_Brandenburg|  appointed in 1560, the secularisation of the bishopric was undertaken and finally accomplished in 1571, in spite of legal proceedings to reassert the imperial immediacy of the prince-bishopric within the Empire and so to likewise preserve the diocese, which dragged on into the 17th century.       949–968: Dietmar   968–980: Dodilo   980–1004: Volkmar   992–1018: Wigo   1022–1032: Luizo   1032-1048: Rudolf   1048–1051: Dankwart   1068–1080: Dietrich I   1080–1092: Volkmar II   1100–1122: Hartbert   1124–1137: Ludolf   1137–1138: Landbert       1138–1160: Wiggar   1160–1173: Wilman   1173–1179:  |Sigfried_I|Siegfried,_Count_Of_Anhalt| |von_Ammendorf|Von_Ammendorf_Family|  Ostheeren or Neuendorfor Bodendieck    .
