Oscar Greeley Clendenning Hammerstein II was born in New York City, the son of Alice Hammerstein and theatrical manager  |William_Hammerstein|Willie_Hammerstein| .  His grandfather was the German theatre  |impresario|Impresario| |Oscar_Hammerstein_I|Oscar_Hammerstein_I| . His father was from a  |Jewish|Jewish|  family, and his mother was the daughter of Scottish and English parents.  He attended the Church of the Divine Paternity, now the  |Fourth_Universalist_Society_in_the_City_of_New_York|Fourth_Universalist_Society_In_The_City_Of_New_York| .       Although Hammersteins father managed the Victoria Theatre for his father and was a producer of  |vaudeville|Vaudeville|  shows, he was opposed to his sons desire to participate in the arts.  Hammerstein attended  |Columbia_University|Columbia_University|  and studied at  |Columbia_Law_School|Columbia_Law_School|  until 1917.  As a student, he maintained high grades and engaged in numerous extracurricular activities. These included playing first base on the baseball team, performing in the  |Varsity_Show|Varsity_Show|  and becoming an active member of  |Pi_Lambda_Phi|Pi_Lambda_Phi| , a mostly Jewish fraternity.      When he was 19, and still a student at Columbia, his father died of  |Brights_disease|Brights_Disease| , June 10, 1914, symptoms of which doctors originally attributed to  |scarlet_fever|Scarlet_Fever| . On the train trip to the funeral with his brother, he read the headlines in the  New York Herald New York Times wrote, Hammerstein, the Barnum of Vaudeville, Dead at Forty. When he and his brother arrived home, they attended their fathers funeral with their grandfather, and more than a thousand others, at  |Temple_Israel|Temple_Israel_Of_The_City_Of_New_York|  in Harlem, and took part in the ceremonies held in the Jewish tradition. Two hours later,  |taps|Taps|  was sounded over Broadway, writes biographer Hugh Fordin.      After his fathers death, he participated in his first play with the  |Varsity_Show|Varsity_Show| , entitled On Your Way. Throughout the rest of his college career, Hammerstein wrote and performed in several Varsity Shows.       After quitting law school to pursue theatre, Hammerstein began his first professional collaboration, with  |Herbert_Stothart|Herbert_Stothart| ,  |Otto_Harbach|Otto_Harbach|  and Frank Mandel.  He began as an apprentice and went on to form a 20-year collaboration with Harbach. Out of this collaboration came his first musical, Always You, for which he wrote the book and lyrics. It opened on  |Broadway|Broadway_Theatre|  in 1920.  The New York Times, January 6, 1920 In 1921 Hammerstein joined  |The_Lambs|The_Lambs|  club.      Throughout the next forty years, Hammerstein teamed with many other composers, including  |Jerome_Kern|Jerome_Kern| , with whom Hammerstein enjoyed a highly successful collaboration. In 1927, Kern and Hammerstein had their biggest hit,  Show Boat , which is often revived and is still considered one of the masterpieces of the American musical theatre. Here we come to a completely new genre  — the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now  ... the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now  ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity. Many years later, Hammersteins wife  |Dorothy|Dorothy_Hammerstein|  bristled when she overheard someone remark that Jerome Kern had written  |Ol_Man_River|Ol_Man_River|  . Indeed not, she retorted. Jerome Kern wrote dum, dum, dum-dum. My husband wrote Ol Man River. Jones, Dylan, the Biographical Dictionary of Popular Music, Picador Press, 2012, pg. 99     Other Kern-Hammerstein musicals include  Sweet Adeline ,  Music in the Air ,  Three Sisters , and  Very Warm for May . Hammerstein also collaborated with  |Vincent_Youmans|Vincent_Youmans|  ,  |Rudolf_Friml|Rudolf_Friml|  , and  |Sigmund_Romberg|Sigmund_Romberg|  .   songwritershalloffame.org          Hammersteins most successful and sustained collaboration began when he teamed up with  |Richard_Rodgers|Richard_Rodgers|  to write a musical adaptation of the play  Green Grow the Lilacs .  Rodgers first partner,  |Lorenz_Hart|Lorenz_Hart| , originally planned to collaborate with Rodgers on this piece, but his alcoholism had become out of control, and he was unable to write. Hart was also not certain that the idea had much merit, and the two therefore separated. The adaptation became the first Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration, entitled  Oklahoma! , which opened on Broadway in 1943. It furthered the revolution begun by  Show Boat , by thoroughly integrating all the aspects of  |musical_theatre|Musical_Theatre| , with the songs and dances arising out of and further developing the plot and characters. William A. Everett and Paul R. Laird wrote that this was a show, that, like Show Boat, became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to Oklahoma. Everett, William A. and Laird, Paul R. , The Cambridge Companion to the Musical, Cambridge University Press, p. 124,  After Oklahoma!, Rodgers and Hammerstein were the most important contributors to the musical-play form – with such masterworks as  Carousel ,  The King and I  and  South Pacific . The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own . , theatrehistory.com, republished from The Complete Book of Light Opera.

Hammerstein also wrote the book and lyrics for  Carmen Jones , an adaptation of  |Georges_Bizets|Georges_Bizet|  opera  Carmen  with an all-black cast that became a 1943 Broadway musical and a 1954 film.       An active advocate for writers rights within the theatre industry, Hammerstein was a member of the  |Dramatists_Guild_of_America|Dramatists_Guild_Of_America| . In 1956, he was elected as the eleventh president of the non-profit organization. He continued his presidency at the Guild until 1960.

The lights of  |Times_Square|Times_Square|  were turned off for one minute,  and Londons  |West_End|West_End_Of_London|   lights were dimmed in recognition of his contribution to the musical. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried at the  |Ferncliff_Cemetery|Ferncliff_Cemetery|  in  |Hartsdale,_New_York|Hartsdale,_New_York| .  A memorial plaque was unveiled at  |Southwark_Cathedral|Southwark_Cathedral| , England, on May 24, 1961.  He was survived by his second wife, Dorothy, his three children, and two stepchildren.

He had three children: William Hammerstein and Alice Hammerstein Mathias by his first wife, and  |James_Hammerstein|James_Hammerstein|  by his second wife, with whom he also had a stepdaughter,  |Susan_Blanchard|Susan_Blanchard| .       Hammerstein was one of the most important book writers in Broadway history – he made the story, not the songs or the stars, central to the musical and brought musical theater to full maturity as an art form.   According to  |Stephen_Sondheim|Stephen_Sondheim| , What few people understand is that Oscars big contribution to the theater was as a theoretician, as a  |Peter_Brook|Peter_Brook| , as an innovator. People dont understand how experimental Show Boat and Oklahoma! felt at the time they were done. Oscar is not about the lark that is learning to pray – thats easy to make fun of. Hes about  Allegro , Hammersteins most experimental musical.      His reputation for being sentimental is based largely on the movie versions of the musicals, especially The Sound of Music, in which a song sung by those in favor of reaching an accommodation with the Nazis,  |No_Way_to_Stop_It|No_Way_To_Stop_It|  , was cut. As recent revivals of Show Boat, Oklahoma!, Carousel, and The King and I in London and New York show, Hammerstein was one of the more tough-minded and socially conscious American musical theater artists. According to Richard Kislan, The shows of Rodgers and Hammerstein were the product of sincerity. In the light of criticism directed against them and their universe of sweetness and light, it is important to understand that they believed sincerely in what they wrote.  According to Marc Bauch, The Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals are romantic musical plays. Love is important.      According to The Rodgers and Hammerstein Story by Stanley Green, For three minutes, on the night of September first, the entire Times Square area in New York City was blacked out in honor of the man who had done so much to light up that particular part of the world. From 8:57 to 9:00 p.m., every neon sign and every light bulb was turned off and all traffic was halted between 42nd Street and 53rd Street, and between 8th Ave and the Avenue of the Americas. A crowd of 5,000 people, many with heads bowed, assembled at the base of the statue of Father Duffy on Times Square where two trumpeters blew taps. It was the most complete blackout on Broadway since World War II, and the greatest tribute of its kind ever paid to one man.        Hammerstein contributed the lyrics to 850 songs, according to The Complete Lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein II, edited by Amy Asch.  Some well-known songs are  |Ol_Man_River|Ol_Man_River|  ,  |Cant_Help_Lovin_That_Man|Cant_Help_Lovin_Dat_Man|  and  |Make_Believe|Make_Believe|  from Show Boat;  |Indian_Love_Call|Indian_Love_Call|  from Rose-Marie;  |People_Will_Say_Were_in_Love|People_Will_Say_Were_In_Love|  and  |Oklahoma|Oklahoma|  from Oklahoma!;  |Some_Enchanted_Evening|Some_Enchanted_Evening|  , from South Pacific;  |Getting_to_Know_You|Getting_To_Know_You|  and  |Shall_We_Dance|The_King_And_I|  from The King and I; and  |the_title_song|The_Sound_Of_Music|  as well as  |Climb_Evry_Mountain|Climb_Evry_Mountain|  from  The Sound of Music .
