      Khadamat-e Aetlaat-e Dawlati  translates directly to  |English|English_Language|  as: State Intelligence Agency . However, this phrase is more precisely translated as State Information Services , Khadamat-e Aetelaat-e Dawlati, almost always known by its  |acronym|Acronym|  KHAD , is the main  |security_agency|Security_Agency|  and  |intelligence_agency|Intelligence_Agency|  of  |Afghanistan|Democratic_Republic_Of_Afghanistan| , and also served as the  |secret_police|Secret_Police|  during the  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| |occupation|Soviet_Occupation_Of_Afghanistan| . The successor to AGSA and KAM , KHAD was nominally part of the Afghan state, but it was firmly under the control of the  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| |KGB|Kgb|  until 1989. In January 1986 its status was upgraded and it was thereafter officially known as the Ministry of State Security .     After the December 1979 Soviet invasion, the KAM was renamed KhAD and came under the control of the KGB. This was an agency specifically created for the suppression of the Democratic Republics internal opponents. However, KHAD has continued to operate after the fall of the Soviet-backed government in 1992 and acted as the intelligence arm of the  |United_Front|Northern_Alliance|  or Northern Alliance during the  |civil_war_in_Afghanistan|Civil_War_In_Afghanistan| .              Little is known of its internal organization and most of its records were either destroyed by the  |Taliban|Taliban|  or were taken to  |Moscow|Moscow|  by the  |KGB|Kgb|  where they remain classified to this day. KHADs system of informers and operatives extended into virtually every aspect of Afghan life, especially in the government-controlled urban areas. Aside from its secret police work, KHAD supervised ideological education at schools and colleges, ran a special school for war orphans, and recruited young men for the  |militia|Militia| .     Its importance to Moscow was reflected in the fact that it was chiefly responsible for the training of a new generation of Afghans who would be loyal to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| . Another important area was work with tribes and ethnic minorities. KHAD collaborated with the Ministry of Nationalities and Tribal Affairs to foster support for the regime in the countryside. KHAD also directed its attention to  |Afghanistans|Afghanistan| |Hindu|Hindu|  and  |Sikh|Sikh|  religious minorities.     KHAD was also responsible for co-opting religious leaders. It funded an official body known as the Religious Affairs Directorate and recruited pro-regime  ulama  and  |mosque|Mosque|  attendants to spy on worshipers.     Some sources give 60% of the  |Peoples_Democratic_Party_of_Afghanistans|Peoples_Democratic_Party_Of_Afghanistan|  membership as belonging to the armed forces,  Sarandoy , or KHAD.       KHAD also had a political role that was clearly unintended by the Soviets. It was initially headed by  |Mohammad_Najibullah|Mohammad_Najibullah| , until he became  |President_of_Afghanistan|President_Of_Afghanistan|  in 1986. Najibullah and other high officials were  |Parcham|Parcham| is. As head of the KHAD apparatus, Najibullah was also extremely powerful.     Consequently, KHAD evolved into a Parchami stronghold, equally zealous in the suppression of enemies of the revolution. Thus, KHAD was zealous in suppressing  |Khalq|Khalq| is in the government and in the armed forces.     There was a bitter rivalry between Najibullah and  |Sayed_Muhammad_Gulabzoi|Sayed_Muhammad_Gulabzoi| . Gulabzoi, a Khalq sympathizer, was Minister of the Interior and commander of Sarandoy , the national  |gendarmerie|Gendarmerie| . Gulabzoi was one of the few prominent Khalqis remaining in office in a Parcham-dominated regime.     In late 1985, Najibullah was promoted to be a secretary on the PDPA Central Committee; in this capacity he may be able to exercise party authority over all security organs, including those attached to the Khalq-dominated defense and interior ministries. It was assumed to be a reward for the efficiency and ruthlessness of the secret police, which was in sharp contrast to the performance of the poorly trained and demoralized armed forces.       In the mid-1980s, KHAD enjoyed a formidable measure of autonomy in relation to other Afghan state institutions.     KHAD reportedly had some success in penetrating the leadership councils of several resistance groups, most of which were headquartered in  |Pakistan|Pakistan| . By the mid-1980s KHAD had gained a fearsome reputation as the eyes, ears, and scourge of the regime. Its influence was pervasive and its methods lawless. KHADs activities reached beyond the borders of Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan and  |Iran|Iran| .     After establishment of Karzai government in 2001, KHAD was reestablished and Gen. Arif of the Northern Alliance became its chief. KHAD was directly controlled by the defense minister  |Mohammed_Fahim|Mohammed_Fahim| , who previously controlled it from 1992 until the  |Taliban|Taliban|  took Kabul in 1996. There are some complaints that KHAD was used as a tool against opponents by the Northern Alliance.       KHAD was also accused of  |human_rights|Human_Rights|  abuses in the mid-1980s.    M. Hassan Kakar. Berkeley, University of California Press, 1995.   also according to a disputed General Report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of The Netherlands, 29 February 2000, English translation 2001 Security services in Communist Afghanistan AGSA, KAM, KhAD and WAD  These included the use of  |torture|Torture| , the use of predetermined  |show_trials|Show_Trial|  to dispose of political prisoners, and widespread arbitrary arrest and detention.

KHAD also operated eight detention centers in the capital, which were located at KHAD headquarters, at the Ministry of the Interior headquarters, and at a location known as the Central Interrogation Office.

In 2008 another report on this matter was published by the  |UNHCR|Unhcr| . In this report some conclusions of the Dutch report were contested.      On 14 October 2005, the District Court in the Hague convicted two high-ranking KhAD officers who sought asylum in the Netherlands in the 1990s. Hesamuddin Hesam and Habibullah Jalalzoy were found guilty of complicity to torture and violations of the laws and customs of war, committed in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Hesam was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. He was the head of the military intelligence service and deputy minister of the Ministry of State Security . Jalalzoy was the head of the unit investigations and interrogations within the military intelligence of the KhAD. He was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment.

General Abdullah Faqirzada was one of the deputy heads of the KhAD-e-Nezamy from 1980 until 1987. Although the court held it plausible that Faqirzada was closely involved with the human rights abuses in the military branch of the KhAD, it concluded there was no evidence for his individual involvement nor his  |command_responsibility|Command_Responsibility| .
