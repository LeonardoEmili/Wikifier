      Edvard Munch  was a  |Norwegian|Norwegians| |painter|Painting| , whose best known work,  The Scream , has become one of the most iconic images of world art.     His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania , Munch began to live a bohemian life under the influence of nihilist  |Hans_Jæger|Hans_Jæger| , who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state . From this would presently emerge his distinctive style.     Travel brought new influences and new outlets. In Paris, he learned much from  |Paul_Gauguin|Paul_Gauguin| ,  |Vincent_van_Gogh|Vincent_Van_Gogh|  and  |Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec|Henri_De_Toulouse-Lautrec| , especially their use of colour. In Berlin, he met Swedish dramatist  |August_Strindberg|August_Strindberg| , whom he painted, as he embarked on his major canon The Frieze of Life, depicting a series of deeply-felt themes such as love, anxiety, jealousy and betrayal, steeped in atmosphere.     But it was back in Kristiania that his legendary work The Scream was conceived. According to Munch, he was out walking at sunset, when he ‘heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature’. That agonised face is widely identified with the angst of modern man. Between 1893 and 1910, he made two painted versions and two in pastels, as well as a number of prints. One of the pastels would eventually command the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.     As his fame and wealth grew, his emotional state remained as insecure as ever. He briefly considered marriage, but could not commit himself. A breakdown in 1908 forced him to give up heavy drinking, and he was cheered by his increasing acceptance by the people of Kristiania and exposure in the city’s museums. His later years were spent working in peace and privacy. Although his works were banned in Nazi Germany, most of them survived World War II, ensuring him a secure legacy.         Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of  |Ådalsbruk|Ådalsbruk|  in  |Løten|Løten| ,  |Norway|Union_Between_Sweden_And_Norway| , to Laura Catherine Bjølstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Laura was artistically talented and may have encouraged Edvard and Sophie. Edvard was related to painter  |Jacob_Munch|Jacob_Munch|  and to historian  |Peter_Andreas_Munch|Peter_Andreas_Munch| .      The family moved to Christiania  in 1864 when Christian Munch was appointed medical officer at  |Akershus_Fortress|Akershus_Fortress| . Edvards mother died of  |tuberculosis|Tuberculosis|  in 1868, as did Munchs favorite sister Johanne Sophie in 1877.  After their mothers death, the Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of American writer  |Edgar_Allan_Poe|Edgar_Allan_Poe| .      As Edvard remembered it, Christians positive behavior toward his children was overshadowed by his morbid  |pietism|Pietism| . Munch wrote, My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to the point of psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born.  Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvards poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him.  One of Munchs younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died a few months after the wedding. Munch would later write, I inherited two of mankinds most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity.      Christian Munchs military pay was very low, and his attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty. They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. Munchs early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By his teens, art dominated Munchs interests.  At thirteen, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school. He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils.           In 1879, Munch enrolled in a  |technical_college|Institute_Of_Technology|  to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and math. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies.  The following year, much to his fathers disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an unholy trade , and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters.  In contrast to his fathers rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance toward art. He wrote his goal in his diary: in my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself.     In 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch. His teachers were sculptor  |Julius_Middelthun|Julius_Middelthun|  and the  |naturalistic|Naturalism|  painter  |Christian_Krohg|Christian_Krohg| .  That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the Academy in his first portraits, including one of his father and his first self-portrait. In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students.  His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critics dismissive response: It is impressionism carried to the extreme. It is a travesty of art.  Munchs nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for Standing Nude . They may have been confiscated by his father.      During these early years, Munch experimented with many styles, including  |Naturalism|Naturalism|  and  |Impressionism|Impressionism| . Some early works are reminiscent of  |Manet|Édouard_Manet| . Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses. At one point, however, Munchs father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munchs cousin Edvard Diriks , destroyed at least one painting and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.      Munch also received his fathers ire for his relationship with  |Hans_Jæger|Hans_Jæger| , the local nihilist who lived by the code a passion to destroy is also a creative passion and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom.  Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. My ideas developed under the influence of the  |bohemians|Bohemianism|  or rather under Hans Jæger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of  |Strindberg|Strindberg|  and the Germans…but that is wrong. They had already been formed by then.  At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called The City of Free Love.  Still dependent on his family for many of his meals, Munchs relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian life.     After numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jægers commandment that Munch should write his life , meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his souls diary .  This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting  The Sick Child  , based on his sisters death, was his first soul painting , his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another violent outburst of moral indignation from the community.      Only his friend Christian Krohg defended him:   He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munchs pictures are as a rule not complete , as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.      Munch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style.  His idiom continued to veer between  |naturalistic|Naturalism| , as seen in Portrait of Hans Jæger, and  |impressionistic|Impressionism| , as in Rue Lafayette. His  Inger On the Beach  , which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come.  He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the  |Post-Impressionists|Post-Impressionism| , what evolved was a subject matter which was  |symbolist|Symbolism|  in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter  |Léon_Bonnat|Léon_Bonnat| .      Munch seems to have been an early critic of photography as an art form, and remarked that it will never compete with the brush and the palette, until such time as photographs can be taken in Heaven or Hell!      Munchs younger sister Laura was the subject of his 1899 interior Melancholy: Laura. Amanda ONeill says of the work, In this heated claustrophobic scene Munch not only portrays Lauras tragedy, but his own dread of the madness he might have inherited.        Munch arrived in Paris during the festivities of the  |Exposition_Universelle|Exposition_Universelle|  and roomed with two fellow Norwegian artists. His picture Morning was displayed at the Norwegian pavilion.  He spent his mornings at Bonnats busy studio and afternoons at the exhibition, galleries, and museums .  Munch recorded little enthusiasm for Bonnats drawing lessons— It tires and bores me—its numbing —but enjoyed the masters commentary during museum trips.       Munch was enthralled by the vast display of modern European art, including the works of three artists who would prove influential:  |Paul_Gauguin|Paul_Gauguin| ,  |Vincent_van_Gogh|Vincent_Van_Gogh| , and  |Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec|Henri_De_Toulouse-Lautrec| —all notable for how they used color to convey emotion. Munch was particularly inspired by Gauguins reaction against realism and his credo that art was human work and not an imitation of Nature , a belief earlier stated by  |Whistler|James_Abbott_Mcneill_Whistler| .  As one of his Berlin friends said later of Munch, he need not make his way to Tahiti to see and experience the primitive in human nature. He carries his own Tahiti within him.  Influenced by Gauguin, as well as the etchings of German artist  |Max_Klinger|Max_Klinger| , Munch experimented with prints as a medium to create graphic versions of his works. In 1896 he created his first woodcuts—a medium that proved ideal to Munchs symbolic imagery. Together with his contemporary  |Nikolai_Astrup|Nikolai_Astrup| , Munch is considered an innovator of the woodcut medium in Norway.     In December 1889 his father died, leaving Munchs family destitute. He returned home and arranged a large loan from a wealthy Norwegian collector when wealthy relatives failed to help, and assumed financial responsibility for his family from then on.  Christians death depressed him and he was plagued by suicidal thoughts: I live with the dead—my mother, my sister, my grandfather, my father…Kill yourself and then its over. Why live?  Munchs paintings of the following year included sketchy tavern scenes and a series of bright cityscapes in which he experimented with the  |pointillist|Pointillism|  style of  |Georges_Seurat|Georges_Seurat| .              By 1892, Munch formulated his characteristic, and original,  |Synthetist|Synthetism| |aesthetic|Aesthetic| , as seen in  Melancholy  , in which color is the symbol-laden element. Considered by the artist and journalist  |Christian_Krohg|Christian_Krohg|  as the first  |Symbolist|Symbolism|  painting by a Norwegian artist, Melancholy was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo.  In 1892,  |Adelsteen_Normann|Adelsteen_Normann| , on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited Munch to exhibit at its November exhibition,  the societys first one-man exhibition. However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy , and after one week the exhibition closed. Munch was pleased with the great commotion , and wrote in a letter: Never have I had such an amusing time—its incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir.      In Berlin, Munch became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual  |August_Strindberg|August_Strindberg| , whom he painted in 1892. He also met Danish writer and painter  |Holger_Drachmann|Holger_Drachmann| , whom he painted in 1898. Drachmann was 17 years Munchs senior and a drinking companion at  |Zum_schwarzen_Ferkel|Zum_Schwarzen_Ferkel|  in 1893–94.  In 1894 Drachmann wrote of Munch: He struggles hard. Good luck with your struggles, lonely Norwegian.      During his four years in Berlin, Munch sketched out most of the ideas that would comprise his major work, The Frieze of Life, first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings.  He sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his controversial paintings.  Already, Munch was showing a reluctance to part with his paintings, which he termed his children .     His other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked his early mature style.  Munch also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures. Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in Ashes, the figures impart a monumental, static quality. Munchs figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage , whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in The Scream, Munchs men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic. He wrote, No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving.      The Scream      The Scream exists in four versions: two pastels and two paintings . There are also several lithographs of The Scream .     The 1895 pastel sold at auction on 2 May 2012 for  |US$|Us$| 119,922,500, including commission. It is the most colorful of the versions and is distinctive for the downward-looking stance of one of its background figures. It is also the only version not held by a Norwegian museum.     The 1893 version was stolen from the  |National_Gallery|National_Museum_Of_Art,_Architecture_And_Design|  in Oslo in 1994 and recovered. The 1910 painting was stolen in 2004 from The Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage.     The Scream is Munchs most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis.     With this painting, Munch met his stated goal of the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self .  Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.  He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, The Scream? I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again.      In summing up the paintings effects, author Martha Tedeschi has stated:    Whistlers Mother , Woods  American Gothic , Leonardo da Vincis  Mona Lisa  and Edvard Munchs The Scream have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.     Frieze of Life—A Poem about Life, Love and Death |Unter_den_Linden|Unter_Den_Linden|  in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of Munchs work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled Study for a Series: Love. This began a cycle he later called the Frieze of Life—A Poem about Life, Love and Death. Frieze of Life motifs, such as The Storm and Moonlight, are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as Rose and Amelie and Vampire. In Death in the Sickroom, the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding Anxiety, Ashes,  Madonna  and Women in Three Stages .      Around the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the Frieze . He painted a number of pictures, several of them in bigger format and to some extent featuring the  |Art_Nouveau|Art_Nouveau|  aesthetics of the time. He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting Metabolism , initially called Adam and Eve. This work reveals Munchs preoccupation with the fall of man and his pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as The Empty Cross and Golgotha  reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munchs pietistic upbringing. The entire Frieze was shown for the first time at the  |secessionist|Berlin_Secession|  exhibition in Berlin in 1902.      The Frieze of Life themes recur throughout Munchs work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death.  These themes are expressed in paintings such as  The Sick Child  , Love and Pain , Ashes , and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers  or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair .     Munch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity.  These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artists sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence.  Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as Madonna, Hands and Puberty, and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series.  Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life—it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity.      While attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s Munch began to receive some understanding of his artistic goals, as one critic wrote, With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, he paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul.  One of his great supporters in Berlin was  |Walther_Rathenau|Walther_Rathenau| , later the German  |foreign_minister|Foreign_Minister| , who strongly contributed to his success.          In 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his Frieze of Life themes. He further developed his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munchs Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by  |Paul_Klee|Paul_Klee| .  Munch also produced multi-colored versions of The Sick Child,  |concerning_tuberculosis|Tuberculosis_In_Human_Culture| , which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of Kiss . Many of the Parisian critics still considered Munchs work violent and brutal but his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance.  His financial situation improved considerably and in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fishermans cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of  |Åsgårdstrand|Åsgårdstrand|  in Norway. He dubbed this home the Happy House and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years. It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my paintings—I get so inspired to paint when I am here .        In 1897 Munch returned to Kristiania, where he also received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance.  In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a liberated upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in The Frieze of Life series, The Dance of Life .  Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married.  Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin. His Girls on the Jetty, created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations. In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval.  The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munchs work even though the public still found his work alien and strange.     The good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and  |Max_Linde|Max_Linde| . He described the turn of events in his diary, After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me.  However, despite this positive change, Munchs self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. Munch later sawed a self-portrait depicting him and Larsen in half as a consequence of the shooting and subsequent events. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings.  His paintings Still Life  and The Death of Marat I, done in 1906–07, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects.      In 1903–04, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming  |Fauvists|Fauvism| , famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs.  After studying the sculpture of  |Rodin|Auguste_Rodin| , Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture.  During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition.  In 1906, he painted the screen for an  |Ibsen|Ibsen|  play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlins  |Deutsches_Theater|Deutsches_Theater| , in which the Frieze of Life was hung. The theatres director  |Max_Reinhardt|Max_Reinhardt|  later sold it; it is now in the Berlin  |Nationalgalerie|Nationalgalerie| . After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations.           In the autumn of 1908, Munchs anxiety, compounded by excessive drinking and brawling, had become acute. As he later wrote, My condition was verging on madness—it was touch and go.  Subject to hallucinations and feelings of persecution, he entered the clinic of Daniel Jacobson. The  |therapy|Psychotherapy|  Munch received for the next eight months included diet and electrification .  Munchs stay in hospital stabilized his personality, and after returning to Norway in 1909, his work became more colorful and less pessimistic. Further brightening his mood, the general public of Kristiania finally warmed to his work, and museums began to purchase his paintings. He was made a Knight of the Royal Order of St. Olav for services in art .  His first American exhibit was in 1912 in New York.      As part of his recovery, Dr. Jacobson advised Munch to only socialize with good friends and avoid  |drinking_in_public|Drinking_In_Public| . Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery.  He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.      The outbreak of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, All my friends are German but it is France I love.  In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during the rise of the Nazi movement.  Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work.  Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the  |Spanish_flu|Spanish_Flu| , the worldwide pandemic of that year.           Munch spent most of his last two decades in solitude at his nearly self-sufficient estate in Ekely, at  |Skøyen|Skøyen| , Oslo.  Many of his late paintings celebrate farm life, including several in which he used his work horse Rousseau as a model.  Without any effort, Munch attracted a steady stream of female models, whom he painted as the subjects of numerous nude paintings. He likely had sexual relationships with some of them.  Munch occasionally left his home to paint murals on commission, including those done for the  |Freia|Freia|  chocolate factory.      To the end of his life, Munch continued to paint unsparing self-portraits, adding to his self-searching cycle of his life and his unflinching series of takes on his emotional and physical states. In the 1930s and 1940s, the  |Nazis|Nazis|  labeled Munchs work  |degenerate_art|Degenerate_Art|   and removed his 82 works from German museums.   |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  announced in 1937, For all we care, those prehistoric Stone Age culture barbarians and art-stutterers can return to the caves of their ancestors and there can apply their primitive international scratching.      In 1940, the  |Germans_invaded_Norway|Occupation_Of_Norway_By_Nazi_Germany|  and the Nazi party took over the government. Munch was 76 years old. With nearly an entire collection of his art in the second floor of his house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation. Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors , including The Scream and The Sick Child, and they too were hidden from the Nazis.      Munch died in his house at Ekely near Oslo on 23 January 1944, about a month after his 80th birthday. His Nazi-orchestrated funeral suggested to Norwegians that he was a Nazi sympathizer, a kind of appropriation of the independent artist.  The city of Oslo bought the Ekely estate from Munchs heirs in 1946; his house was demolished in May 1960.                  When Munch died, his remaining works were bequeathed to the city of Oslo, which built the  |Munch_Museum|Munch_Museum|  at  |Tøyen|Tøyen|  . The museum holds a collection of approximately 1,100 paintings, 4,500 drawings, and 18,000 prints, the broadest collection of his works in the world.  The Munch Museum serves as Munchs official estate, and has been active in responding to copyright infringements, as well as clearing copyright for the work, such as the appearance of Munchs The Scream in a 2006  |M_&_Ms|M_&_Ms|  advertising campaign.  The U.S. copyright representative for the Munch Museum and the Estate of Edvard Munch is the  |Artists_Rights_Society|Artists_Rights_Society| .      Munchs art was highly personalized and he did little teaching. His private symbolism was far more personal than that of other Symbolist painters such as  |Gustave_Moreau|Gustave_Moreau|  and  |James_Ensor|James_Ensor| . Munch was still highly influential, particularly with the  |German_Expressionists|German_Expressionism| , who followed his philosophy, I do not believe in the art which is not the compulsive result of Mans urge to open his heart. Many of his paintings, including The Scream, have universal appeal in addition to their highly personal meaning.     Munchs works are now represented in numerous major museums and galleries in Norway and abroad. His cabin, the Happy House , was given to the municipality of Åsgårdstrand in 1944; it serves as a small Munch Museum. The inventory has been maintained exactly as he left it.     One version of The Scream was stolen from the National Gallery in 1994. In 2004, another version of The Scream, along with one of Madonna, was stolen from the Munch Museum in a daring daylight robbery. All were eventually recovered, but the paintings stolen in the 2004 robbery were extensively damaged. They have been meticulously restored and are on display again. Three Munch works were stolen from the Hotel  |Refsnes_Gods|Refsnes_Gods|  in 2005; they were shortly recovered, although one of the works was damaged during the robbery.
