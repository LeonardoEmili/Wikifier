Although bacteria are traditionally divided into two main groups, gram-positive and gram-negative, based on their Gram stain retention property, this classification system is ambiguous as it refers to three distinct aspects , which do not necessarily coalesce for some bacterial species.     The gram-positive and gram-negative staining response is also not a reliable characteristic as these two kinds of bacteria do not form phylogenetic coherent groups. However, although Gram staining response is an empirical criterion, its basis lies in the marked differences in the ultrastructure and chemical composition of the bacterial cell wall, marked by the absence or presence of an outer lipid membrane.      All gram-positive bacteria are bounded by a single-unit lipid membrane, and, in general, they contain a thick layer of peptidoglycan responsible for retaining the Gram stain.
