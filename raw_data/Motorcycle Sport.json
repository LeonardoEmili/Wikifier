There are differing variants, with each variant racing on a different surface type.          A road rally is a navigation event on public roads whereby competitors must visit a number of checkpoints in diverse geographical locations while still obeying road traffic laws .          Speedway is a motorcycle sport in which the motorcycles have one gear and no brakes.              Land speed is where a single rider accelerates over a 1 to  long straight track and is timed for top speed through a trap at the end of the run. The rider must exceed the previous top speed record for that class or type of bike for their name to be placed on the record books. See & mdash; for an example.            Enduro is not exactly racing, because the main objective is to traverse a series of checkpoints, arriving exactly on time in accordance with your beginning time and the time it is supposed to take to arrive at each checkpoint. The courses are usually run over thick wooded terrain, sometimes with large obstacles such as logs, ditches, and sudden drops.

Trials is a test of skill on a motorcycle whereby the rider attempts to traverse an observed section without placing a foot on the ground . The winner is the rider with the least penalty points.       Time and observation trials are trials with a time limit. The person who completes the route the quickest sets the standard time and all other competitors must finish within a certain amount of time of the standard time to be counted as a finisher . This is combined with the penalty points accrued from the observed sections to arrive at a winner, who is not alway the quickest rider or the rider who lost the less marks on observation but the rider who balanced these competing demands the best.
