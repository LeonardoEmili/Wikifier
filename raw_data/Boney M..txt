   Boney M. is a  |Euro|Europe| - |Caribbean|Caribbean| |_vocal_group|List_Of_Vocal_Groups|  created by  |German|Germans|  record producer  |Frank_Farian|Frank_Farian| . Originally based in  |West_Germany|West_Germany| , the four original members of the groups official line-up were  |Liz_Mitchell|Liz_Mitchell|  and  |Marcia_Barrett|Marcia_Barrett|  from  |Jamaica|Jamaica| ,  |Maizie_Williams|Maizie_Williams|  from  |Montserrat|Montserrat|  and  |Bobby_Farrell|Bobby_Farrell| , a performing-artist from  |Aruba|Aruba| . The group was formed in 1976 and achieved popularity during the  |disco|Disco|  era of the late 1970s. Since the 1980s, various line-ups of the band have performed with different personnel.     The band has sold around 100 million records worldwide and is known for huge international hits such as  |Daddy_Cool|Daddy_Cool|  ,  |Ma_Baker|Ma_Baker|  ,  |Sunny|Sunny_Boney_M_Version|  ,  |Rasputin|Rasputin|  ,  |Marys_Boy_Child_–_Oh_My_Lord|Marys_Boy_Child_–_Oh_My_Lord|  and  |Rivers_of_Babylon|Rivers_Of_Babylon|  .          German singer-songwriter  |Frank_Farian|Frank_Farian|   recorded the dance track  |Baby_Do_You_Wanna_Bump|Baby_Do_You_Wanna_Bump|  in December 1974. Farian sang the repeated line Do you do you wanna bump? in a deep voice as well as performing the high  |falsetto|Falsetto|  chorus. When the record was released as a single, it was credited to Boney M. , a pseudonym Farian had created for himself after watching the Australian detective show  Boney . Boney M by John Shearlaw and David Brown, Hamlin Paperbacks, 1979 -page 35-6 He said:          After a slow start, the song became a hit in the Netherlands and Belgium. It was then that Farian decided to hire performers to front the group for TV performances. Farian found  |Maizie_Williams|Maizie_Williams|  , who brought in  |Bobby_Farrell|Bobby_Farrell| , a male exotic dancer from  |Aruba|Aruba| . Singer  |Marcia_Barrett|Marcia_Barrett|  joined the group, who brought in  |Liz_Mitchell|Liz_Mitchell| , former member of the  |Les_Humphries_Singers|Les_Humphries_Singers|  and Boney M. was finalised.     Take the Heat off Me  Take the Heat off Me , was released in 1976. It contained tracks that Marcia Barrett had already recorded with Farian, including the title track and Lovin or Leavin , both of which were previously recorded in German by another Farian act,  |Gilla|Gilla| . As Maizie Williams voice was not considered suitable for recording purposes by Farian, and a try-out with Bobby Farrell performing  |No_Woman_No_Cry|No_Woman_No_Cry|  did not work, Farian decided to use only Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett along with his own studio-enhanced voice to create the Boney M. sound.     The albums commercial performance was initially lukewarm. However, the group rigorously toured discos, clubs and even country fairs to earn a reputation for themselves. The groups big break came when, at the end of summer 1976, German television producer Michael Mike Leckebusch  requested the group for his show  Musikladen . Boney M. appeared on the live music show on 18 September 1976, after 10  pm and in their daring stage costumes, where they performed the song  |Daddy_Cool|Daddy_Cool|  . The song quickly went to no.1 in Germany, with the album following the success of the single. Another single,  |Sunny|Sunny|   gave the group their second no.1 hit. The groups popularity had also grown throughout Europe, with Daddy Cool reaching no.1 in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Austria. Both singles were also Top 10 hits in the UK, which would become one of their biggest markets.     Love for Sale  Love for Sale , which contained the hits  |Ma_Baker|Ma_Baker|  and  |Belfast|Belfast|  . The group embarked on their first major concert tours with a live band of musicians called The Black Beauty Circus .  Love for Sale  was certified Gold a year after its release in the UK.  Both singles from the album reached no.1 in Germany and the UK Top 10.     Nightflight to Venus  |Rivers_of_Babylon|Rivers_Of_Babylon| / |Brown_Girl_in_the_Ring|Brown_Girl_In_The_Ring|  , which became a massive hit all over Europe, reaching No. 1 in several countries as well as becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time in the UK. It also became their most successful single in the United States, peaking at No. 30 on the  |U_S_pop_singles_chart|Billboard_Hot_100| . Following this came their biggest-selling album,  Nightflight to Venus , which spawned further hit singles with  |Rasputin|Rasputin|  and  |Painter_Man|Painter_Man|  . Continuing with their success, they released  |Marys_Boy_Child_Oh_My_Lord|Marys_Boy_Child_Ndash_Oh_My_Lord|  , which was the 1978  |Christmas_number_one_single|List_Of_Christmas_Number_One_Singles|  in the United Kingdom and became another of the biggest selling singles of all time there. Also during 1978, Boney M. made a much publicized promotional visit to the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union| , one of the very few Western acts along with  |Elton_John|Elton_John|  to do so, although tracks like Rasputin were not released in the Soviet Union due to their lyrics.     While it had never been a secret that Bobby Farrell never sang on the groups records , in 1978 it became public knowledge that Maizie Williams did not sing on the studio recordings either, since her voice wasnt suited for this kind of music as Farian stated in an interview with German teen magazine  Bravo . Since this had become common practice within the disco genre of the late 1970s, few people cared – unlike when Farian did the same thing with  |Milli_Vanilli|Milli_Vanilli|  in the late 1980s. While only two of Boney M.s official members actually contributed to  |the_bands_records|Boney_M_Discography| , all four members of the group, including Williams and Farrell, performed the vocals live at Boney M. concerts.  The bands live sound was also augmented by several  |backing_vocalists|Backing_Vocalist| , which served to mitigate any vocal deficiencies the group may have had compared with the studio productions.     Oceans of Fantasy  |Hooray_Hooray_Its_a_Holi_Holiday|Hooray_Hooray_Its_A_Holi_Holiday|  , which became another Top 10 hit across Europe. Later in the year they released their fourth album,  Oceans of Fantasy , containing two hit singles –  |_Gotta_Go_Home_El_Lute_|El_Lute_Gotta_Go_Home|  and  |_Im_Born_Again_Bahama_Mama_|Im_Born_Again_Bahama_Mama| . The album also included a Lead and Backing Vocals credit for the first time. Oceans of Fantasy reached no.1 in the UK and was certified Platinum, though their run of Top 10 singles had now ended with Gotta Go Home peaking at no.12 and Im Born Again peaking at 35.       In 1980, Boney M. released a greatest hits album,  The Magic of Boney M.   20 Golden Hits , which also contained two new songs, My Friend Jack and I See a Boat on the River . It made the No. 1 spot in the UK, reaching Gold status within six weeks of release, though it was their last big-selling album in the UK.     Boonoonoonoos  Boonoonoonoos  was finally released by the end of that year, Bobby Farrell was fired from the group due to his unreliability. While still a healthy seller in continental Europe, Boonoonoonoos failed to crack the UK Top 100 after three consecutive No. 1 albums, and Farrells departure left the group unable to promote it. Following this, the group released a Christmas Album.     Ten Thousand Lightyears  |Reggie_Tsiboe|Reggie_Tsiboe|  was hired to replace Farrell as the new male member of Boney M. in 1982 but the singles The Carnival Is Over and Jambo fared poorly, and the groups seventh album  Ten Thousand Lightyears , issued in 1984, marked another commercial low point peaking at 23 in the German album charts. The group, however, returned to the German Top 20 in the autumn of 1984 with Kalimba de Luna and  |Happy_Song|Happy_Song|  , the latter seeing Bobby Farrell return to the group. Both songs were carbon-copies of the original Italian hits by  |Tony_Esposito|Tony_Esposito|  and  |Babys_Gang|Babys_Gang|  respectively.     Eye Dance  Eye Dance  was widely regarded as uninspired and disappointing. After celebrating Boney M.s 10th anniversary in early 1986, the group officially disbanded after the release of the commercially unsuccessful single Young, Free and Single which peaked at No.48.        From this point, different versions of the group were formed by members, some with cooperation of Farian, others without . One version began touring in the first half of 1987 with Marilyn Scharbaai taking Liz Mitchells place. Mitchell returned for a second leg of the tour late 1987, and Marcia Barrett soon left the band. At the same time, Bobby Farrell had set up a deal for a new Boney M. album to be recorded without Farian in Belgium. When Farrell failed to show up for either recording or tour, and Maizie Williams had never sung on record, the album ended up being released as Liz Mitchells first solo album No One Will Force You. Mitchell and Williams completed a tour during 1987–88, adding singer Celena Duncan and Ron Gale as replacements for Barrett and Farrell. Carol Grey later replaced Celena Duncan and Curt De Daran later replaced Ron Gale.     In October 1988, the classic Boney M. line-up reunited without producer Frank Farian for the album  Greatest Hits of All Times   Remix 88  but tensions ran high between the members, and Liz Mitchell left in the spring of 1989 to be replaced by Madeleine Davis. While Mitchell promoted her solo album, the group recorded the single  |Everybody_Wants_to_Dance_Like_Josephine_Baker|Everybody_Wants_To_Dance_Like_Josephine_Baker|  , without Farians knowledge or approval. Threatened with legal action by the producer over the use of the Boney M. name, the single was subsequently withdrawn and Farian issued Stories with his own new Boney M. line-up featuring Liz Mitchell, Reggie Tsiboe and two new members, Sharon Stevens and Patty Onoyewenjo, Stories peaked at 11 in the Swiss charts. A second remix album  Greatest Hits of All Times   Remix 89   Volume II  was released but fared poorly.       1992 saw a renewed interest in Boney M.s music with the Boney M. Megamix single returning the group to the UK Top 10 for the first time since 1980, and a subsequent Greatest Hits album reaching the UK Top 20 in 1993. While Marcia Barrett, now residing in Florida, was battling cancer and unable to perform, Boney M. toured the world with a line-up of Liz Mitchell, Carol Grey, Patricia Lorna Foster and Curt Dee Daran . They released the single ‘Papa Chico’ but failed to chart. Maizie Williams assembled her own Boney M. with an ever-changing line-up. Bobby Farrell also toured with varying trios of female performers.             Liz Mitchell was touring the world with her line-up of Boney M., which is the only line-up officially supported by Farian . Bobby Farrell and Liz Mitchell have released solo albums containing their own re-recordings of Boney M.s classic hits. Maizie Williams released her first solo album in 2006 and her own single version of Boney M.s Sunny . In 2007 her rendition of Daddy Cool with  |Melo_M|Melo_M|  hit the number one spot in the Latvian Charts.  Marcia Barrett has released two solo albums with a third scheduled for release in 2010.      As recounted in his 1988 book  Touching the Void , the British climber  |Joe_Simpson|Joe_Simpson|  was subsequently to find the catchy tune of Brown Girl in the Ring haunting him in the final hours of his struggle to survive the descent of  |Siula_Grande|Siula_Grande|  in the  |Andes|Andes| , and the song was later used in the 2003 film of  Touching the Void  made by  |Kevin_Macdonald|Kevin_Macdonald| . Simpson recalls: I remember thinking, bloody hell, Im going to die to Boney M .     A musical based on the music of Boney M.,  Daddy Cool , opened in London in August 2006 to mixed reviews and sluggish ticket sales, causing it to close in February 2007. From April to July 2007, the show played in a mobile theatre in Berlin, which was specially designed for it.     In April 2007, Australian pop singer Peter Wilson released a song co-written by  |Frank_Farian|Frank_Farian|  entitled  |Doin_Fine|Daddy_Cool_Doin_Fine|  . It is described as paying tribute to the sound of Boney M. and features the famous string arrangement from their first number 1 hit,  |Daddy_Cool|Daddy_Cool|  .     Boney M. made a live appearance at the 37th  |International_Film_Festival_of_India|International_Film_Festival_Of_India|  , which took place on 23 November 2006 in  |Panaji|Panaji| , the state capital of  |Goa|Goa| , India. The group is also popular in the Vietnamese diaspora,  and was featured in Thuy Nga music productions.     In the UK, a new album of their greatest hits, entitled  The Magic of Boney M.  was released via  |BMG|Bertelsmann_Music_Group|  on 27 November 2006. Special additions to this release were a  |Mousse_T_|Mousse_T_|  remix of  |Sunny|Sunny|  and a brand new song from 2006, featuring Liz Mitchell, entitled A Moment of Love .

In November 2007, a new  |Christmas_compilation|Christmas_With_Boney_M_|  was scheduled for release as well as the DVD Fantastic Boney M. – On Stage and on the Road featuring a live performance recorded in Vienna on 1 November 1977 , and a film from the bands 1981 visit to  |Jamaica|Jamaica|  .     Bobby Farrells Boney M. performed a concert at the Amphi in  |Raanana|Raanana| ,  |Israel|Israel|  in May 2007.

Hooray! Its a Holi-Holiday .     The legal rights to the name Boney M. have been a matter of controversy, and even court cases, between the former members of the band and producer Frank Farian ever since the late 1980s. Farian, the man who in effect created the group, has continued to work with Liz Mitchell and her line-up all through the 1990s and 2000s. In January 2007, Zanillya Farrell and Yasmina Ayad-Saban renewed the trademark to the name Boney M. in Germany for a 10-year period.     In January 2009,  |Frank_Farian|Frank_Farian|  released a brand new single called Felicidad America  under the name-check Boney M. feat. Sherita O. & Yulee B. featuring two new vocalists. The song is a remake of the 1980 Boney M. classic  |Felicidad_|Felicidad|  with new vocals and re-written lyrics now referring to the new US president  |Barack_Obama|Barack_Obama| .       In July 2010, Maizie Williams headlined a Boney M. performance at Ramallahs Cultural Palace, in the West Bank, as part of the Palestine International Festival. The band played Daddy Cool , Ma Baker and Brown Girl in the Ring , but refrained from playing Rivers of Babylon , rumored to be at the event organizers request because of its description of the Jewish yearning for Zion.        Bobby Farrell died at the age of 61 from heart failure on 30 December 2010. His agent said Farrell was complaining of breathing problems after performing with his band the evening before.   Farrell lived in Amsterdam until his death. The singer was found dead in a hotel room in  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg| , Russia, where he had been performing.      It was announced in February 2014 that Maizie Williams line-up of Boney M. would be touring Australia in June.  They sang at Guilfest, Guildford, UK on 20 July, and Watchet Live music festival UK, on 24 August.     In March 2015, Farian released Diamonds, a 3CD box celebrating the 40th anniversary of Boney M.

After remaining at No.1 for five weeks, Rivers of Babylon began dropping down the chart, at which point the  |B_side|B_Side|  Brown Girl in the Ring was given extensive radio airplay, and the single ascended to No. 2. The single spent six months in the UK Top 40, including 19 weeks in the Top 10. It eventually sold over two million copies, the second single to do so, and is still one of only seven to achieve this feat.      The group achieved a second UK million-seller with their version of the  |calypso|Calypso_Music|  classic  |Marys_Boy_Child|Marys_Boy_Child|  , released as a medley  |Marys_Boy_Child_–_Oh_My_Lord|Marys_Boy_Child_–_Oh_My_Lord|  , which was previously a million-seller for  |Harry_Belafonte|Harry_Belafonte| .

Compared to other best-selling artists of the 1970s like  |ABBA|Abba| ,  |Donna_Summer|Donna_Summer| , and the  |Bee_Gees|Bee_Gees| , the Boney M. discography is quite unusual – while the greater part of the bands back catalogue has been remixed, remade, remodeled and reissued all through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s by producer Frank Farian and record company  |BMG_Ariola|Bmg_Ariola|  , most of the original 7 and 12 versions issued on vinyl in the 1970s and early 1980s remained unavailable on CD until 2008 and the release of the box set  The Collection  and the single CD compilation  Rivers of Babylon .
