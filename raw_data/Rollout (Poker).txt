Rollout or roll em out is  |poker_jargon|Poker_Jargon|  used for a game phase in certain  |poker_variants|List_Of_Poker_Variants| . It is often incorrectly called  |roll_your_own|Roll_Your_Own|  , to which it has similarities but from which it is fundamentally different.     Poker games with a rollout phase resemble  |stud_poker|Stud_Poker|  but have significantly different strategies, because players generally receive all of their cards up front , and know the final value of their hand in early betting rounds. They resemble stud poker only in that cards are revealed to other players one at a time for each betting round.     There are the same three variations on the idea as with roll your own, depending on when players are allowed to choose which card to reveal. They can either be forced to arrange the order of their cards before any betting begins , or they can also be allowed to choose cards in later rounds based on information found in earlier rounds . In the latter case, the revealing can be made simultaneously or in turn.     In the game of show five, for example, each player is dealt seven cards before any betting begins, and each of the games five betting rounds begins with the players simultaneously revealing one of their cards . Rollout games are frequently played  |high_low_split|High_Low_Split| , and players choose which cards to reveal in order to delay as long as possible revealing which half of the pot they intend to win.
