The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool, but Mona Best was always looking for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of one of the smaller  |semi_detached|Semi_Detached|  houses prevalent in the area.

In 1960,  |Allan_Williams|Allan_Williams| , the Beatles manager, arranged a season of bookings in Hamburg, starting on 17 August 1960, but complained that they did not impress him, and hoped that he could find a better act.     Having no permanent drummer,  |Paul_McCartney|Paul_Mccartney|  looked for someone to fill the Hamburg position. Best had been seen playing in the Casbah with his own group, the Black Jacks, and it was noted that he was a steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the  |bar|Bar| , which pushed the rhythm. In Liverpool, his female fans knew him as being mean, moody, and magnificent , which convinced McCartney he would be good for the group. The Beatles Anthology DVD 2003 McCartney talking Bests reputation in Liverpool After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney persuaded Best to go to Hamburg with the group, by saying they would each earn £15 per week . As Best had passed his school exams , he had the chance to attend teacher-training college, but he decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move. Best had an audition in the Jacaranda Club, which Williams owned, and travelled to Hamburg the next day.

The Beatles first played a full show with Best on 17 August 1960 The Complete Beatles Chronicle by Mark Lewisohn at the Indra club in Hamburg, and the group slept in the  |Bambi_Kino|The_Beatles_In_Hamburgbambi_Kino|  cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former storeroom directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place patronised by a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger  |Kaiserkeller|Kaiserkeller| . As Best had been the only group member to study  |O_Level|O_Level|  German at school, he could converse with the clubs owner,  |Bruno_Koschmider|Bruno_Koschmider| , and the clientele. After the Indra closed following complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.     In October 1960, the group left Koschmiders club to work at the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a slightly better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.     Back in Liverpool, the group members had no contact with each other for two weeks, but Best and his mother made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the groups equipment. Mona arranged all the bookings for the group in Liverpool, after parting company with Williams in late 1961.      |Chas_Newby|Chas_Newby| , the ex-Black Jacks guitarist, was invited to play bass for four concerts, as bassist  |Stuart_Sutcliffe|Stuart_Sutcliffe|  had decided to stay in Hamburg.  beatlesource.com – Retrieved 5 November 2007 Newby played with the group at Litherland Town Hall and at the Casbah. He was shocked at the vast improvement in their playing and singing, and remembered Bests drumming to be very powerful, which pushed the group to play harder and louder. It was probably thanks to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he often told Best in Hamburg to crank it up . When the group returned to Hamburg, by which time McCartney had switched to bass, Best was asked to sing a speciality number written by McCartney, Pinwheel Twist , while McCartney played drums, but he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage.         The reunited Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961. While they played at the Top Ten Club, singer  |Tony_Sheridan|Tony_Sheridan|  recruited them to act as his backing band on a recording for the German  |Polydor|Polydor_Records|  label, produced by bandleader  |Bert_Kaempfert|Bert_Kaempfert| , who signed the group to a Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October 1961, Polydor released the recording  |My_Bonnie|My_Bonnie|  which appeared on the German charts under the name Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers —a generic name used for whoever happened to be in Sheridans backup band. The song was later released in the UK. My Bonnie / The Saints 23 April 1962.

The group recorded 15 songs, mostly cover versions with three Lennon–McCartney songs. John Lennon later admitted they were terrified and nervous. A month later, Decca informed Epstein the group had been rejected. The band members were informed of the rejection except for Best. Epstein officially became the manager of the Beatles on 24 January 1962 with the contract signed in Petes house.      Epstein negotiated ownership of the Decca audition tape, which was then transferred to an acetate disc, in order to promote the band to other record companies in London. In the meantime, Epstein negotiated the release of the Beatles from their recording contract with Bert Kaempfert and  |Polydor_Records|Polydor_Records|  in Germany, which expired on 22 June 1962. Tune In by Mark Lewisohn As a part of this contract, the Beatles recorded at Polydors Studio Rahlstedt on 24 May 1962 in Hamburg as a sessions band, backing Tony Sheridan.   Less than two weeks later the Beatles were recording again at  |Abbey_Road_studios|Abbey_Road_Studios|  in London for  |EMI|Emi| .     The record producer at EMI,  |George_Martin|George_Martin| , met with Epstein on 9 May 1962 at the Abbey Road studios, and was impressed with his enthusiasm. He agreed to sign the Beatles on a recording contract, based on listening to the Decca audition tape, without having met them or having seen them perform live.      Soon after the recording contract was signed, the Beatles performed a commercial test on 6 June 1962 in Studio Two at the Abbey Road studios. Assistant producer  |Ron_Richards|Ron_Richards|  and his engineer  |Norman_Smith|Norman_Smith|  recorded four songs:  |Bésame_Mucho|Bésame_Mucho|  ,  |P_S_I_Love_You|P_S_I_Love_You|  ,  |Ask_Me_Why|Ask_Me_Why|  and  |Love_Me_Do|Love_Me_Do|  .  The last three songs were the Beatles own compositions, which was very unusual for bands new to recording. Martin was in the building but not in the studio. Martin was called into the studio by Norman Smith when he heard the band play Love Me Do .  At the end of the session Martin asked the individual Beatles if there was anything they personally did not like, to which  |George_Harrison|George_Harrison|  replied, Well, theres your tie, for a start. That was the turning point, according to Smith, as Lennon, McCartney, and Best joined in with jokes and comic wordplay.     The Beatles were not new to studio recording, and Bests drumming had been found acceptable by Polydor in Hamburg, but Richards had alerted Martin to Bests unsuitability for British studio work. EMI engineer Norman Smith stated in a 2006 video interview that there was nothing wrong with Petes drumming talent, noting ...it was mainly down to what he was playing and not how he was playing, when Love Me Do was first recorded, referring to the head  |arrangement|Arrangementjazz| .
