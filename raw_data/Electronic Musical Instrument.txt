   An electronic musical instrument is a  |musical_instrument|Musical_Instrument|  that produces sound using  |electronic_circuitry|Electronics| . Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical, electronic or digital  |audio_signal|Audio_Signal|  that ultimately is plugged into a  |power_amplifier|Power_Amplifier|  which drives a  |loudspeaker|Loudspeaker| , creating the sound heard by the performer and listener.     An electronic instrument might include a  |user_interface|User_Interface|  for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the  |pitch|Pitch| ,  |frequency|Frequency| , or duration of each  |note|Musical_Note| . A common user interface is the  |musical_keyboard|Musical_Keyboard| , which functions similarly to the keyboard on an acoustic  |piano|Piano| , except that with an electronic keyboard, the keyboard itself does not make any sound. An electronic keyboard sends a signal to a  |synth_module|Synth_Module| ,  |computer|Computer|  or other electronic or digital sound generator, which then creates a sound. However, it is increasingly common to separate user interface and sound-generating functions into a  |music_controller|Midi_Controller|   and a  |music_synthesizer|Music_Synthesizer| , respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as  |MIDI|Midi|  or  |Open_Sound_Control|Open_Sound_Control| .     All electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of  |audio_signal_processing|Audio_Signal_Processing|  applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called  |sound_effects|Sound_Effect| ; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often unclear.     In the 2010s, electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. In popular music styles such as  |electronic_dance_music|Electronic_Dance_Music| , almost all of the instrument sounds used in recordings are electronic instruments . Development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on  |New_Interfaces_for_Musical_Expression|New_Interfaces_For_Musical_Expression| , have organized to report cutting-edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.             In the 18th-century, musicians and composers adapted a number of acoustic instruments to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the  |Denis_dor|Denis_Dor|  keyboard, dating from 1753, followed shortly by the  |clavecin_électrique|Clavecin_Électrique|  by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The Denis dor consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily to enhance sonic qualities. The clavecin électrique was a keyboard instrument with  |plectra|Plectrum|  activated electrically. However, neither instrument used electricity as a sound-source.     The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by  |Elisha_Gray|Elisha_Gray| .   The Musical Telegraph was a chance by-product of his telephone technology when Gray accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self-vibrating electromagnetic circuit and so invented a basic  |oscillator|Electronic_Oscillator| . The Musical Telegraph used steel reeds oscillated by electromagnets and transmitted over a telephone line. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device into later models, which consisted of a diaphragm vibrating in a magnetic field.     A significant invention, which later had a profound effect on electronic music, was the  |audion|Audion|  in 1906. This was the first thermionic valve, or  |vacuum_tube|Vacuum_Tube|  and which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcasting, and electronic computation, among other things. Other early synthesizers included the  |Telharmonium|Telharmonium|  , the  |Theremin|Theremin|  , Jörg Magers  |Spharophon|Spharophon|  and Partiturophone, Taubmanns similar  |Electronde|Electronde|  ,  |Maurice_Martenots|Maurice_Martenot| |ondes_Martenot|Ondes_Martenot|  , Trautweins  |Trautonium|Trautonium|  . The Mellertion used a non-standard scale, Bertrands Dynaphone could produce octaves and perfect fifths, while the Emicon was an American, keyboard-controlled instrument constructed in 1930 and the German Hellertion combined four instruments to produce chords. Three Russian instruments also appeared, Oubouhofs  |Croix_Sonore|Croix_Sonore|  ,  |Ivor_Darregs|Ivor_Darreg| |microtonal|Microtonal_Music|  Electronic Keyboard Oboe and the  |ANS_synthesizer|Ans_Synthesizer| , constructed by the Russian scientist  |Evgeny_Murzin|Evgeny_Murzin|  from 1937 to 1958. Only two models of this latter were built and the only surviving example is currently stored at the Lomonosov University in  |Moscow|Moscow| . It has been used in many Russian movies—like  Solaris —to produce unusual, cosmic sounds.  All the preceding instruments except those of Darreg and Murzin described in P. Scholes, The Oxford Companion to Music, 10th Ed. OUP, p.322      |Hugh_Le_Caine|Hugh_Le_Caine| , John Hanert,  |Raymond_Scott|Raymond_Scott| , composer  |Percy_Grainger|Percy_Grainger|  , and others built a variety of automated electronic-music controllers during the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1959  |Daphne_Oram|Daphne_Oram|  produced a novel method of synthesis, her  |Oramics|Oramics|  technique, driven by drawings on a 35  mm film strip; it was used for a number of years at the  |BBC_Radiophonic_Workshop|Bbc_Radiophonic_Workshop| .  This workshop was also responsible for the theme to the TV series  |Doctor_Who|Doctor_Who| , a piece, largely created by  |Delia_Derbyshire|Delia_Derbyshire| , that more than any other ensured the popularity of electronic music in the UK.               In 1897  |Thaddeus_Cahill|Thaddeus_Cahill|  patented an instrument called the Telharmonium . Using  |tonewheels|Tonewheel|  to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by  |additive_synthesis|Additive_Synthesis| , it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the  |Hammond_organ|Hammond_Organ| . Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahills enterprise was bankrupt.                  Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919-1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin  built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the  |Theremin|Theremin| . This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines. The Theremin was notable for being the first musical instrument played without touching it. In 1929,  |Joseph_Schillinger|Joseph_Schillinger|  composed First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra, premièred with the  |Cleveland_Orchestra|Cleveland_Orchestra|  with  |Leon_Theremin|Leon_Theremin|  as soloist. The next year  |Henry_Cowell|Henry_Cowell|  commissioned Theremin to create the first electronic rhythm machine, called the  |Rhythmicon|Rhythmicon| . Cowell wrote some compositions for it, and he and Schillinger premiered it in 1932.               The 1920s have been called the apex of the Mechanical Age and the dawning of the Electrical Age. In 1922, in Paris,  |Darius_Milhaud|Darius_Milhaud|  began experiments with vocal transformation by phonograph speed change. Herbert Russcol, The Liberation of Sound: An Introduction to Electronic Music : 68. These continued until 1927. This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instruments  along with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the  |Ondes_Martenot|Ondes_Martenot| , which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, and the  |Trautonium|Trautonium| .   Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris. Composers using the instrument ultimately include  |Boulez|Pierre_Boulez| ,  |Honegger|Arthur_Honegger| ,  |Jolivet|André_Jolivet| ,  |Koechlin|Charles_Koechlin| ,  |Messiaen|Olivier_Messiaen| ,  |Milhaud|Darius_Milhaud| ,  |Tremblay|Gilles_Tremblay| , and  |Varèse|Edgard_Varèse| .  |Radiohead|Radiohead|  guitarist and multi-instrumentalist  |Jonny_Greenwood|Jonny_Greenwood|  also uses it in his compositions and a plethora of Radiohead songs. In 1937, Messiaen wrote Fête des belles eaux for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in  Trois petites Liturgies de la Présence Divine  and the  Turangalîla-Symphonie  .               The Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the  |subharmonic|Subharmonic|  scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of  Parsifal . In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden première of his Japanese Festival Music. This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.               In 1929  |Laurens_Hammond|Laurens_Hammond|  established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the  |Hammond_organ|Hammond_Organ| , which was based on the principles of the  |Telharmonium|Telharmonium| , along with other developments including early reverberation units. Russcol 1972, 70. The Hammond organ is an electromechanical instrument, as it used both mechanical elements and electronic parts. A Hammond organ used spinning metal tonewheels to produce different sounds. A  |magnetic_pickup|Magnetic_Pickup|  similar in design to the pickups in an  |electric_guitar|Electric_Guitar|  is used to transmit the pitches in the tonewheels to an amplifier and speaker enclosure. While the Hammond organ was designed to be a lower-cost alternative to a  |pipe_organ|Pipe_Organ|  for church music, musicians soon discovered that the Hammond was an excellent instrument for  |blues|Blues|  and  |jazz|Jazz| ; indeed, an entire genre of music developed built around this instrument, known as the  |organ_trio|Organ_Trio|  .     The first commercially manufactured synthesizer was the  |Novachord|Novachord| , built by the  |Hammond_Organ|Hammond_Organ|  Company from 1938 to 1942, which offered 72-note  |polyphony|Polyphony|  using 12 oscillators driving  |monostable|Monostable| -based divide-down circuits, basic  |envelope|Envelope_Generator|  control and resonant  |low-pass_filters|Low-Pass_Filter| . The instrument featured 163 vacuum tubes and weighed 500 pounds. The instruments use of envelope control is significant, since this is perhaps the most significant distinction between the modern synthesizer and other electronic instruments.                  The most commonly used electronic instruments are  |synthesizers|Synthesizer| , so-called because they artificially generate sound using a variety of techniques. All early circuit-based synthesis involved the use of analogue circuitry, particularly voltage controlled amplifiers, oscillators and filters. An important technological development was the invention of the  |Clavivox|Clavivox| |synthesizer|Synthesizer|  in 1956 by  |Raymond_Scott|Raymond_Scott|  with subassembly by  |Robert_Moog|Robert_Moog| . French  |composer|Composer|  and engineer  |Edgard_Varèse|Edgard_Varèse|  created a variety of compositions using  |electronic_horns|Electronic_Horn| , whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote  Poème électronique  for the Phillips pavilion at the  |Brussels_World_Fair|Expo_58|  in 1958.           |RCA|Rca|  produced experimental devices to synthesize voice and music in the 1950s. The  |Mark_II_Music_Synthesizer|Rca_Mark_Ii_Sound_Synthesizer| , housed at the  |Columbia-Princeton_Electronic_Music_Center|Computer_Music_Center|  in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| . Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, with contributions from Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, it was only capable of producing music by programming, using a  |paper_tape|Paper_Tape| |sequencer|Music_Sequencer|  punched with holes to control pitch sources and filters, similar to a mechanical  |player_piano|Player_Piano|  but capable of generating a wide variety of sounds. The  |vacuum_tube|Vacuum_Tube|  system had to be patched to create timbres.        In the 1960s synthesizers were still usually confined to studios due to their size. They were usually modular in design, their stand-alone signal sources and processors connected with patch cords or by other means and controlled by a common controlling device.  |Harald_Bode|Harald_Bode| ,  |Don_Buchla|Don_Buchla| ,  |Hugh_Le_Caine|Hugh_Le_Caine| ,  |Raymond_Scott|Raymond_Scott|  and  |Paul_Ketoff|Paul_Ketoff|  were among the first to build such instruments, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Buchla later produced a commercial modular synthesizer, the  |Buchla_Music_Easel|Buchla| .   |Robert_Moog|Robert_Moog| , who had been a student of  |Peter_Mauzey|Peter_Mauzey|  and one of the RCA Mark II engineers, created a synthesizer that could reasonably be used by musicians, designing the circuits while he was at Columbia-Princeton. The  |Moog_synthesizer|Moog_Modular_Synthesizer|  was first displayed at the  |Audio_Engineering_Society|Audio_Engineering_Society|  convention in 1964.  It required experience to set up sounds but was smaller and more intuitive than what had come before, less like a machine and more like a musical instrument. Moog established standards for control interfacing, using a logarithmic 1-volt-per-octave for pitch control and a separate triggering signal. This standardization allowed synthesizers from different manufacturers to operate simultaneously. Pitch control was usually performed either with an organ-style keyboard or a  |music_sequencer|Music_Sequencer|  producing a timed series of control voltages. During the late 1960s hundreds of popular recordings used Moog synthesizers. Other early commercial synthesizer manufacturers included  |ARP|Arp_Instruments,_Inc.| , who also started with modular synthesizers before producing all-in-one instruments, and British firm  |EMS|Electronic_Music_Studios_Ltd| .                In 1970, Moog designed the  |Minimoog|Minimoog| , a non-modular synthesizer with a built-in keyboard. The analogue circuits were interconnected with switches in a simplified arrangement called normalization. Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and easier to use. The  |Minimoog|Minimoog|  sold 12,000 units.  further standardized the design of subsequent synthesizers with its integrated keyboard, pitch and modulation wheels and VCO- .
