     Plant cells are  |eukaryotic|Eukaryote|  cells present in  |green_plants|Viridiplantae| , photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom  |Plant|Plant| ae. Their distinctive features include primary cell walls containing cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin, the presence of plastids with the capability to perform photosynthesis and store starch, a large  |vacuole|Vacuole|  that regulates turgor pressure, the absence of  |flagella|Flagellum|  or  |centrioles|Centriole| , except in the gametes, and a unique method of cell division involving the formation of a cell plate or  |phragmoplast|Phragmoplast|  that separates the new daughter cells.         Plant cells have  |cell_walls|Cell_Wall| , constructed outside the  |cell_membrane|Cell_Membrane|  and composed of  |cellulose|Cellulose| ,  |hemicelluloses|Hemicellulose| , and  |pectin|Pectin| . Their composition contrasts with the cell walls of  |fungi|Fungus| , which are made of  |chitin|Chitin| , of  |bacteria|Bacteria| , which are made of  |peptidoglycan|Peptidoglycan|  and of  |archaea|Archaea| , which are made of  |pseudopeptidoglycan|Pseudopeptidoglycan| . In many cases  |lignin|Lignin|  or  |suberin|Suberin|  are secreted by the  |protoplast|Protoplast|  as secondary wall layers inside the primary cell wall.  |Cutin|Cutin|  is secreted outside the primary cell wall and into the outer layers of the secondary cell wall of the epidermal cells of leaves, stems and other above-ground organs to form the  |plant_cuticle|Plant_Cuticle| . Cell walls perform many essential functions. They provide shape to form the tissue and organs of the plant, and play an important role in intercellular communication and plant-microbe interactions.      Many types of plant cells contain a large central  |vacuole|Vacuole| , a water-filled volume enclosed by a membrane known as the  |tonoplast|Tonoplast|   that maintains the cells  |turgor|Turgor| , controls movement of  |molecules|Molecules|  between the  |cytosol|Cytosol|  and  |sap|Plant_Sap| , stores useful material such as  |phosphorus|Phosphorus|  and  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|   and digests waste  |proteins|Protein|  and  |organelles|Organelle| .     Specialized cell-to-cell communication pathways known as  |plasmodesmata|Plasmodesmata| ,  occur in the form of pores in the primary cell wall through which the  |plasmalemma|Plasmalemma|  and  |endoplasmic_reticulum|Endoplasmic_Reticulum|   of adjacent cells are continuous.     Plant cells contain  |plastids|Plastid| , the most notable being  |chloroplasts|Chloroplast| , which contain the green-colored pigment  |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll|  that converts the energy of sunlight into chemical energy that the plant uses to make its own food from water and carbon dioxide in the process known as  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis|   . Other types of plastids are the  |amyloplasts|Amyloplast| , specialized for  |starch|Starch|  storage,  |elaioplasts|Elaioplast|  specialized for  |fat|Fat|  storage, and  |chromoplasts|Chromoplast|  specialized for synthesis and storage of  |pigments|Pigment| . As in  |mitochondria|Mitochondria| , which have a genome encoding 37 genes,  plastids have their own  |genomes|Genome|  of about 100–120 unique  |genes|Gene|   and are interpreted as having arisen as  |prokaryotic|Prokaryote| |endosymbionts|Endosymbiont|  living in the cells of an early  |eukaryotic|Eukaryote|  ancestor of the  |land_plants|Embryophyte|  and  |algae|Algae| .      Cell division in land plants and a few groups of algae, notably the  |Charophytes|Charophyta|   and the  |Chlorophyte|Chlorophyta|  Order  |Trentepohliales|Trentepohliales| ,  takes place by construction of a  |phragmoplast|Phragmoplast|  as a template for building a  |cell_plate|Cell_Plate|  late in  |cytokinesis|Cytokinesis| .     The motile, free-swimming  |sperm|Sperm|  of  |bryophytes|Bryophyte|  and  |pteridophytes|Pteridophytes| ,  |cycads|Cycad|  and  Ginkgo  are the only cells of land plants to have  |flagella|Flagella|   similar to those in  |animal_cells|Eukaryoteanimal_Cell| ,   but the  |conifers|Conifers|  and  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plant|  do not have motile sperm and lack both flagella and  |centrioles|Centriole| .          Plant cells differentiate from undifferentiated  |meristem|Meristem| atic cells to form the major classes of cells and tissues of  |roots|Root| ,  |stems|Plant_Stem| ,  |leaves|Leaf| ,  |flowers|Flower| , and reproductive structures, each of which may be composed of several cell types.        |_Parenchyma_cells|Ground_Tissueparenchyma|  are living cells that have functions ranging from storage and support to  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis|   and phloem loading . Apart from the xylem and phloem in their vascular bundles, leaves are composed mainly of parenchyma cells. Some parenchyma cells, as in the epidermis, are specialized for light penetration and focusing or regulation of  |gas_exchange|Gas_Exchange| , but others are among the least specialized cells in plant tissue, and may remain  |totipotent|Totipotent| , capable of dividing to produce new populations of undifferentiated cells, throughout their lives.  Parenchyma cells have thin, permeable primary walls enabling the transport of small molecules between them, and their cytoplasm is responsible for a wide range of biochemical functions such as  |nectar|Nectar| |_secretion|Secretion| , or the manufacture of  |secondary_products|Secondary_Metabolite|  that discourage  |herbivory|Herbivory| . Parenchyma cells that contain many chloroplasts and are concerned primarily with photosynthesis are called  |chlorenchyma|Chlorenchyma|  cells. Others, such as the majority of the parenchyma cells in  |potato|Potato| |_tubers|Tubers|  and the  |seed|Seed| |_cotyledons|Cotyledons|  of  |legumes|Legumes| , have a storage function.        |Collenchyma_cells|Ground_Tissuecollenchyma|  – collenchyma cells are alive at maturity and have thickened cellulosic cell walls. These cells mature from meristem derivatives that initially resemble parenchyma, but differences quickly become apparent. Plastids do not develop, and the secretory apparatus proliferates to secrete additional primary wall. The wall is most commonly thickest at the corners, where three or more cells come in contact, and thinnest where only two cells come in contact, though other arrangements of the wall thickening are possible.  |Pectin|Pectin|  and  |hemicellulose|Hemicellulose|  are the dominant constituents of collenchyma cell walls of  |dicotyledon|Dicotyledon| |angiosperms|Angiosperm| , which may contain as little as 20% of cellulose in  Petasites .  Collenchyma cells are typically quite elongated, and may divide transversely to give a septate appearance. The role of this cell type is to support the plant in axes still growing in length, and to confer flexibility and tensile strength on tissues. The primary wall lacks lignin that would make it tough and rigid, so this cell type provides what could be called plastic support – support that can hold a young stem or petiole into the air, but in cells that can be stretched as the cells around them elongate. Stretchable support is a good way to describe what collenchyma does. Parts of the strings in celery are collenchyma.           |Sclerenchyma|Ground_Tissuesclerenchyma|  is a tissue composed of two types of cells,  |sclereids|Sclereid|  and  |fibres|Fibres|  that have thickened,  |lignified|Lignin|  secondary walls   laid down inside of the  |primary_cell_wall|Primary_Cell_Wall| . The secondary walls harden the cells and make them impermeable to water. Consequently, scereids and fibres are typically dead at functional maturity, and the cytoplasm is missing, leaving an empty central cavity.  |Sclereids|Sclereid|  or stone cells,  are hard, tough cells that give leaves or fruits a gritty texture. They may discourage herbivory by damaging digestive passages in small insect larval stages. Sclereids form the hard pit wall of peaches and many other fruits, providing physical protection to the developing kernel.  |Fibres|Fibre|  are elongated cells with lignified secondary walls that provide load-bearing support and tensile strength to the leaves and stems of herbaceous plants. Sclerenchyma fibres are not involved in conduction, either of water and nutrients  or of carbon compounds , but it is likely that they evolved as modifications of xylem and phloem initials in early land plants.             |Xylem|Xylem|  is a complex vascular tissue composed of water-conducting  |tracheids|Tracheid|  or  |vessel_elements|Vessel_Elements| , together with fibres and parenchyma cells. Tracheids MT Tyree; MH Zimmermann Xylem structure and the ascent of sap, 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, New York USA are elongated cells with lignified secondary thickening of the cell walls, specialised for conduction of water, and first appeared in plants during their transition to land in the  |Silurian|Silurian|  period more than 425 million years ago . The possession of xylem tracheids defines the  |vascular_plants|Vascular_Plants|  or Tracheophytes. Tracheids are pointed, elongated xylem cells, the simplest of which have continuous primary cell walls and lignified secondary wall thickenings in the form of rings, hoops, or reticulate networks. More complex tracheids with valve-like perforations called  |bordered_pits|Pit|  characterise the gymnosperms. The  |ferns|Fern|  and other  |pteridophytes|Pteridophyte|  and the  |gymnosperms|Gymnosperm|  have only xylem  |tracheids|Tracheid| , while the  |flowering_plants|Angiosperms|  also have  |xylem_vessels|Vessel_Element| . Vessel elements are hollow xylem cells without end walls that are aligned end-to-end so as to form long continuous tubes. The bryophytes lack true xylem tissue, but their  |sporophytes|Sporophyte|  have a water-conducting tissue known as the hydrome that is composed of elongated cells of simpler construction.        |Phloem|Phloem|  is a specialised tissue for food transport in higher plants, mainly transporting  |sucrose|Sucrose|  along pressure gradients generated by osmosis, a process called  |translocation|Phloemfunction| . Phloem is a complex tissue, consisting of two main cell types, the  |sieve_tubes|Sieve_Tube_Element|  and the intimately associated  |companion_cells|Companion_Cell| , together with parenchyma cells, phloem fibres and sclereids.  Sieve tubes are joined end-to-end with perforate end-plates between known as  sieve plate s, which allow transport of photosynthate between the sieve elements. The sieve tube elements lack  |nuclei|Cell_Nucleus|  and  |ribosomes|Ribosome| , and their metabolism and functions are regulated by the adjacent nucleate companion cells. The companion cells, connected to the sieve tubes via  |plasmodesmata|Plasmodesmata| , are responsible for loading the phloem with  |sugars|Sugar| . The  |bryophytes|Bryophyte|  lack phloem, but  |moss|Moss| |sporophytes|Sporophyte|  have a simpler tissue with analogous function known as the leptome.            The  |plant_epidermis|Epidermis|  is specialised tissue, composed of parenchyma cells, that covers the external surfaces of leaves, stems and roots. Several cell types may be present in the epidermis. Notable among these are the stomatal guard cells that control the rate of  |gas_exchange|Gas_Exchangeplants|  between the plant and the atmosphere, glandular and clothing hairs or  |trichomes|Trichome| , and the  |root_hairs|Root_Hair|  of primary roots. In the shoot epidermis of most plants, only the  |guard_cells|Stomata|  have chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll which is needed for photosynthesis. The epidermal cells of aerial organs arise from the superficial layer of cells known as the tunica that covers the plant  |shoot_apex|Meristem| , whereas the cortex and vascular tissues arise from innermost layer of the shoot apex known as the corpus . The epidermis of roots originates from the layer of cells immediately beneath the root cap. The epidermis of all aerial organs, but not roots, is covered with a  |cuticle|Plant_Cuticle|  made of  |polyester|Polyester| |_cutin|Cutin|  or polymer  |cutan|Cutan|  , with a superficial layer of  |epicuticular_wax|Epicuticular_Wax| es. The epidermal cells of the primary shoot are thought to be the only plant cells with the biochemical capacity to synthesize cutin.
