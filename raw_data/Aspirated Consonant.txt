           In  |phonetics|Phonetics| , aspiration is the strong burst of  |breath|Breathing|  that accompanies either the release or, in the case of  |preaspiration|Preaspiration| , the closure of some  |obstruents|Obstruent| . In English, aspirated consonants are  |allophones|Allophone|  in  |complementary_distribution|Complementary_Distributionin_Phonology|  with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most  |Indian|Languages_Of_India|  and  |East_Asian_languages|East_Asian_Languages| , the difference is  |contrastive|Contrastive_Distributionphonology| .     To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of ones mouth, and say spin  and then pin . One should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with pin that one does not get with spin.       In the  |International_Phonetic_Alphabet|International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  , aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for  |voiceless_consonants|Voicelessness|  followed by the  |aspiration_modifier_letter|Phonetic_Symbols_In_Unicodespacing_Modifier_Letters|  , a  |superscript_form|Subscript_And_Superscript|  of the symbol for the  |voiceless_glottal_fricative|Voiceless_Glottal_Fricative|  . For instance,  represents the voiceless  |bilabial_stop|Bilabial_Stop| , and  represents the aspirated bilabial stop.      |Voiced_consonants|Voice|  are seldom actually aspirated. Symbols for  |voiced_consonants|Voice|  followed by , such as , typically represent consonants with  |murmured_voice|Murmured_Voice| d release . In the  |grammatical_tradition|Shiksha|  of  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit| , aspirated consonants are called voiceless aspirated, and breathy-voiced consonants are called voiced aspirated.     There are no dedicated IPA symbols for degrees of aspiration and typically only two degrees are marked: unaspirated  and aspirated .  |An_old_symbol|Obsolete_And_Nonstandard_Symbols_In_The_International_Phonetic_Alphabet|  for light aspiration was , but this is now obsolete. The aspiration modifier letter may be doubled to indicate especially strong or long aspiration. Hence, the two degrees of aspiration in Korean stops are sometimes transcribed  or  and , but they are usually transcribed  and ,  word lists from , , . with the details of voice onset time given numerically.     Preaspirated consonants are marked by placing the aspiration modifier letter before the consonant symbol:  represents the preaspirated bilabial stop.     Unaspirated or  |tenuis_consonants|Tenuis_Consonant|  are occasionally marked with the modifier letter for unaspiration , a  |superscript|Unicode_Subscripts_And_Superscripts| |equals_sign|Equals_Sign| . Usually, however, unaspirated consonants are left unmarked: .           |Voiceless_consonants|Voicelessness|  are produced with the  |vocal_folds|Vocal_Folds|  open and not vibrating, and voiced consonants are produced when the vocal folds are fractionally closed and vibrating . Voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal folds remain open after a consonant is released. An easy way to measure this is by noting the consonants  |voice_onset_time|Voice_Onset_Time| , as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal folds close.     In some languages, such as  |Navajo|Navajo_Phonology| , aspiration of stops tends to be phonetically realised as voiceless velar airflow; aspiration of affricates is realised as an extended length of the frication.     Aspirated consonants are not always followed by vowels or other voiced sounds. For example, in  |Eastern_Armenian|Eastern_Armenian| , aspiration is contrastive even word-finally, and aspirated consonants occur in  |consonant_clusters|Consonant_Cluster| . In  |Wahgi|Wahgi_Language| , consonants are aspirated only when they are in final position.       The degree of aspiration varies: the voice onset time of aspirated stops is longer or shorter depending on the language or the place of articulation.     Armenian and  |Cantonese|Cantonese|  have aspiration that lasts about as long as English aspirated stops, in addition to unaspirated stops. Korean has lightly-aspirated stops that fall between the Armenian and Cantonese unaspirated and aspirated stops as well as strongly-aspirated stops whose aspiration lasts longer than that of Armenian or Cantonese.      Aspiration varies with  |place_of_articulation|Place_Of_Articulation| . The Spanish voiceless stops  have voice onset times of about 5, 10, and 30 milliseconds, and English aspirated  have VOTs of about 60, 70, and 80 ms. Voice onset time in Korean has been measured at 20, 25, and 50 ms for  and 90, 95, and 125 for .           When aspirated consonants are doubled or  |geminated|Gemination| , the stop is held longer and then has an aspirated release. An aspirated affricate consists of a stop, fricative, and aspirated release. A doubled aspirated affricate has a longer hold in the stop portion and then has a release consisting of the fricative and aspiration.        |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language|  and  |Faroese|Faroese_Language|  have consonants with  |preaspiration|Preaspiration|  , and some scholars interpret them as consonant clusters as well. In Icelandic, preaspirated stops  |contrast_with_double_stops_and_single_stops|Icelandic_Phonologyaspiration_And_Length_Contrasts|   or  zeal     hoax     opening     Preaspirated stops also occur in most  |Sami_languages|Sami_Languages| . For example, in  |Northern_Sami|Northern_Sami| , the unvoiced stop and affricate phonemes , , , ,  are pronounced preaspirated  in medial or final position.       Although most aspirated obstruents in the worlds languages are stops and affricates,  |aspirated_fricatives|Aspirated_Fricative|  such as ,  or  have been documented in  |Korean|Korean_Language| , though these are allophones of other phonemes. Similarly, aspirated fricatives and even aspirated nasals, approximants, and trills occur in a few  |Tibeto-Burman_languages|Tibeto-Burman_Languages| , in some  |Oto-Manguean_languages|Oto-Manguean_Languages| , in the Hmongic language  |Hmu|Hmu_Language| , and in the Siouan language  |Ofo|Ofo_Language| . Some languages, such as  |Choni_Tibetan|Choni_Language| , have as many as four contrastive aspirated fricatives  ,  and .  |Guillaume_Jacques|Guillaume_Jacques|  2011. A panchronic study of aspirated fricatives, with new evidence from Pumi, Lingua 121.9:1518â€“1538      Voiced consonants with voiceless aspiration |murmured|Murmured|  consonants such as the  that are common among the  |languages_of_India|Languages_Of_India| , are extremely rare. They have been documented in  |Kelabit|Kelabit_Language| |Robert_Blust|Robert_Blust| , 2006, The Origin of the Kelabit Voiced Aspirates: A Historical Hypothesis Revisited , Oceanic Linguistics 45:311       Aspiration has varying significance in different languages. It is either allophonic or phonemic, and may be analyzed as an  |underlying|Underlying_Representation|  consonant cluster.          In some languages, such as English, aspiration is  |allophonic|Allophone| . Stops are distinguished primarily by  |voicing|Voice| , and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated, while voiced stops are usually unaspirated.      |English|English_Language| |voiceless|Voiceless| |stops|Stop_Consonant|  are aspirated for most native speakers when they are word-initial or begin a  |stressed_syllable|Stressed_Syllable| .     For instance, distend has unaspirated  since it is not analyzed as two morphemes, but distaste has an aspirated middle  because it is analyzed as dis- + taste and the word taste has an aspirated initial t.     Word-final voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated.     Voiceless stops in  |Pashto|Pashto|  are slightly aspirated prevocalically in a stressed syllable.       In many languages, such as  |Armenian|Armenian_Language| ,  |Korean|Korean_Language| ,  |Lakota|Lakota_Language| ,  |Thai|Thai_Language| ,  |Indo-Aryan_languages|Indo-Aryan_Languages| ,  |Dravidian_languages|Dravidian_Languages| ,  |Icelandic|Icelandic_Language| ,  |Faroese|Faroese_Language| ,  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek| , and the  |varieties_of_Chinese|Varieties_Of_Chinese| , tenuis and aspirated consonants are  |phonemic|Phoneme| . Unaspirated consonants like  and aspirated consonants like  are separate phonemes, and words  |are_distinguished|Distinctive_Feature|  by whether they have one or the other.        |Alemannic_German_dialects|Alemannic_German|  have unaspirated  as well as aspirated ; the latter series are usually viewed as  |consonant_clusters|Consonant_Cluster| .       In  |Danish|Danish_Language|  and most southern varieties of  |German|German_Language| , the  |lenis|Fortis_And_Lenis|  consonants transcribed for historical reasons as  are distinguished from their  |fortis|Fortis_And_Lenis|  counterparts , mainly in their lack of aspiration.        |French|French_Language| ,    Standard  |Dutch|Dutch_Language| , Frans Hinskens, Johan Taeldeman, https://books.google.com/books?idt8jmBQAAQBAJ & lpgPA106 & dqfrisian%20substrate%20dutch & hlnl & pgPA66vsnippet & q Language and space: Dutch, Walter de Gruyter 2014. 3110261332, 9783110261332, p.66  |Tamil|Tamil_Language| ,  |Italian|Italian_Language| ,  |Russian|Russian_Language| ,  |Spanish|Spanish_Language| ,  |Modern_Greek|Greek_Language| ,  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language|  and  |Latvian|Latvian_Language|  are languages that do not have phonemic aspirated consonants.               |Standard_Chinese|Standard_Chinese|  has stops and affricates distinguished by aspiration: for instance, , . In  |pinyin|Pinyin| , tenuis stops are written with letters that represent voiced consonants in English, and aspirated stops with letters that represent voiceless consonants. Thus d represents , and t represents .      |Wu_Chinese|Wu_Chinese|  and  |Southern_Min|Southern_Min|  has a three-way distinction in stops and affricates: . In addition to aspirated and unaspirated consonants, there is a series of muddy consonants, like . These are pronounced with  |slack|Slack_Voice|  or  |breathy_voice|Breathy_Voice| |initial|Syllablechinese|  cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or  |light_tone|Four_Tones| .             Many  |Indo-Aryan_languages|Indo-Aryan_Languages|  have aspirated stops.  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit| ,  |Hindi|Hindustani_Language| ,  |Bengali|Bengali_Language| ,  |Marathi|Marathi_Language| , and  |Gujarati|Gujarati_Language|  have a four-way distinction in stops: voiceless, aspirated, voiced, and breathy-voiced or voiced aspirated, such as .  |Punjabi|Punjabi_Language|  has lost breathy-voiced consonants, which resulted in a  |tone_system|Tone| , and therefore has a distinction between voiceless, aspirated, and voiced: .     Some of the  |Dravidian_languages|Dravidian_Languages| , such as  |Telugu|Telugu_Language| ,  |Malayalam|Malayalam| , and  |Kannada|Kannada_Language| , have a distinction between voiced and voiceless, aspirated and unaspirated only in  |loanwords_from_Indo-Aryan_languages|Indo-Aryan_Loanwords_In_Tamil| . In native Dravidian words, there is no distinction between these categories and stops are  |underspecified|Underspecification|  for voicing and aspiration.          Most dialects of  |Armenian|Armenian_Language|  have aspirated stops, and some have breathy-voiced stops.      |Classical|Classical_Armenian|  and  |Eastern_Armenian|Eastern_Armenian|  have a three-way distinction between voiceless, aspirated, and voiced, such as .      |Western_Armenian|Western_Armenian|  has a two-way distinction between aspirated and voiced: . Western Armenian aspirated  corresponds to Eastern Armenian aspirated  and voiced , and Western voiced  corresponds to Eastern voiceless .          Some forms of  |Greek|Greek_Language|  before the  |Koine_Greek|Koine_Greek|  period are  |reconstructed|Linguistic_Reconstruction|  as having aspirated stops. The  |Classical_Attic_dialect|Attic_Greek|  of  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  had a three-way distinction in stops like Eastern Armenian: . These series were called , ,   smooth, rough, intermediate , respectively, by Koine Greek grammarians.     There were aspirated stops at three places of articulation: labial, coronal, and velar . Earlier Greek, represented by  |Mycenaean_Greek|Mycenaean_Greek| , likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop , which later became labial, coronal, or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment.     The other Ancient Greek dialects,  |Ionic|Ionic_Greek| ,  |Doric|Doric_Greek| ,  |Aeolic|Aeolic_Greek| , and  |Arcadocypriot|Arcadocypriot_Greek| , likely had the same three-way distinction at one point, but Doric seems to have had a fricative in place of  in the Classical period, and the Ionic and Aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration .     Later, during the Koine Greek period, the aspirated and voiced stops  of Attic Greek  |lenited|Lenitionopening|  to voiceless and voiced fricatives, yielding  in  |Medieval|Medieval_Greek|  and  |Modern_Greek|Modern_Greek| . Aspirated consonants survive today in some variants of the Greek language, notably  |Cypriot_Greek|Cypriot_Greek| .           The term aspiration sometimes refers to the sound change of  |debuccalization|Debuccalization| , in which a consonant is  |lenited|Lenition|  to become a  |glottal_stop|Glottal_Stop|  or  |fricative|Voiceless_Glottal_Fricative|  .          So-called voiced aspirated consonants are nearly always pronounced instead with  |breathy_voice|Breathy_Voice| , a type of  |phonation|Phonation|  or vibration of the  |vocal_folds|Vocal_Folds| . The modifier letter  after a voiced consonant actually represents a breathy-voiced or murmured dental stop, as with the voiced aspirated bilabial stop  in the  |Indo-Aryan_languages|Indo-Aryan_Languages| . This consonant is therefore more accurately transcribed as , with the diacritic for breathy voice, or with the modifier letter , a superscript form of the symbol for the  |voiced_glottal_fricative|Voiced_Glottal_Fricative|  .     Some linguists restrict the double-dot subscript  to murmured  |sonorants|Sonorant| , such as  |vowels|Vowel|  and  |nasals|Nasal_Consonant| , which are murmured throughout their duration, and use the superscript hook-aitch .
