The Nilo-Saharan languages are a proposed family of  |African_languages|African_Languages|  spoken by some 50–60 million people, mainly in the upper parts of the  |Chari|Chari_River|  and  |Nile|Nile|  rivers, including historic  |Nubia|Nubia| , north of where the two tributaries of the Nile meet. The languages extend through 17 nations in the northern half of Africa: from  |Algeria|Algeria|  to  |Benin|Benin|  in the west; from  |Libya|Libya|  to the  |Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo|Democratic_Republic_Of_The_Congo|  in the centre; and from  |Egypt|Egypt|  to  |Tanzania|Tanzania|  in the east.     As indicated by its hyphenated name, Nilo-Saharan is a family of the African interior, including the greater Nile Basin and the Central  |Sahara|Sahara|  Desert. Eight of its proposed constituent divisions  are found in the modern two nations of  |Sudan|Sudan|  and  |South_Sudan|South_Sudan| , through which the Nile River flows.     In his book  The Languages of Africa  ,  |Joseph_Greenberg|Joseph_Greenberg|  named the group and argued it was a  |genetic|Genetic|  family. It contains the languages which are not included in the  |Niger–Congo|Niger–Congo_Languages| ,  |Afroasiatic|Afroasiatic_Languages|  or  |Khoisan|Khoisan_Languages|  groups. Although some linguists have seen the phylum as Greenbergs  |wastebasket|Wastebasket_Taxon|  , into which he placed all the otherwise unaffiliated non- |click_languages|Click_Languages|  of Africa,  , specialists in the field have accepted its reality since Greenbergs classification. Blench, Roger & Lameen Souag. m.s. http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Nilo-Saharan/General/Saharan%20Songhay%20branch.pdf Saharan and Songhay form a branch of Nilo-Saharan. Its supporters accept that it is a challenging proposal to demonstrate but contend that it looks more promising the more work is done.        Some of the constituent groups of Nilo-Saharan are estimated to predate the  |African_neolithic|Neolithic_Revolutionagriculture_In_Africa| . Thus, the unity of  |Eastern_Sudanic|Eastern_Sudanic|  is estimated to date to at least the 5th millennium BC.  Nilo-Saharan genetic unity would necessarily be much older still and date to the late  |Upper_Paleolithic|Upper_Paleolithic| .     This larger classification system is not accepted by all linguists, however.  Glottolog  , for example, a publication of the  |Max_Planck_Institute|Max_Planck_Institute|  in Germany, does not recognise the unity of the Nilo-Saharan family or even of the Eastern Sudanic branch;  |Georgiy_Starostin|Georgiy_Starostin|  likewise does not accept a relationship between the branches of Nilo-Saharan, though he leaves open the possibility that some of them may prove to be related to each other once the necessary  |reconstructive|Linguistic_Reconstruction|  work is done.       The constituent families of Nilo-Saharan are quite diverse. One characteristic feature is a tripartite  |singulative|Singulative_Number| – |collective|Collective| – |plurative|Plurative|  number system, which Blench believes is a result of a  |noun-classifier|Classifier|  system in the  |protolanguage|Protolanguage| . The distribution of the families may reflect ancient water courses in a green Sahara during the  |Neolithic_Subpluvial|Neolithic_Subpluvial| , when the desert was more habitable than it is today.        Within the Nilo-Saharan languages are a number of languages with at least a million speakers . In descending order:    |Luo|Luo_Dialect|  .
