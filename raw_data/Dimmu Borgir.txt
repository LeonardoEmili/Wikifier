Gaute Storaas , composer of the orchestral arrangements, released a statement on his role in working on the album. Their music is epic, thematic and symphonic already from the creation; they are clearly having an orchestral approach to composing. My role in this is sometimes just to transcribe their themes, sometimes to take their ideas, tear them apart and build them back up in ways that are true to the bands intentions. The music must also be both interesting and playable for the musicians, and hopefully, meet the quality standards of the orchestral world.

The band became more progressive and symphonic through the years; many black metal purists consider the bands second album, Stormblåst, to be the acts last true contribution to black metal. Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, Dimmu Borgirs third album, distinguished itself in two important areas, firstly forgoing their native language for English and secondly for its dramatic increase in synthesizer content. Significant experimentation began with 1999s  |Spiritual_Black_Dimensions|Spiritual_Black_Dimensions|  , as well as  |Puritanical_Euphoric_Misanthropia|Puritanical_Euphoric_Misanthropia|  due to addition of influences from composers such as Antonín Dvořák , Enya , Richard Wagner , and Frédéric Chopin .

As the music strongly differed from the older, rawer black metal style, Jon Metalion Kristiansen called Spiritual Black Dimensions a fine case of melodic, over-produced symphonic metal. If you like this melodic style I cant really think of anyone doing it better No, I wouldnt call this black metal. Read the interview with Funeral Mist for the right definition of black metal.
