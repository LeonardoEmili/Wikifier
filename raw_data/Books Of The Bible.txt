     Different religious groups include different books in their  |biblical_canons|Biblical_Canon| , in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books. The Jewish  |Tanakh|Tanakh|   contains 24 books divided into three parts: the five books of the  Torah  ; the eight books of the  Neviim  ; and the eleven books of  Ketuvim  . It is composed mainly in  |Biblical_Hebrew|Biblical_Hebrew| , and its  |Septuagint|Septuagint|  is the main textual source for the Christian Greek Old Testament.      |Christian_Bibles|Christian_Bible|  range from the 73 books of the  |Catholic_Church|Catholicism|  canon, the 66 books of the canon of some denominations or the 80 books of the canon of other denominations of the  |Protestant_Church|Protestantism| , to the 81 books of the  |Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  canon. The first part of Christian Bibles is the  |Greek_Old_Testament|Greek_Old_Testament| , which contains, at minimum, the above 24 books of the Tanakh but divided into 39 books and ordered differently. The second part is the  |Greek_New_Testament|Greek_New_Testament| , containing 27 books; the four  |canonical_gospels|Canonical_Gospels| ,  |Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts_Of_The_Apostles| , 21  |Epistles|Epistlenew_Testament_Epistles|  or letters and the  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation| .     The  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church|  and  |Eastern_Christian|Eastern_Christianity|  churches hold that certain  |deuterocanonical_books_and_passages|Deuterocanonical_Books|  are part of the  |Old_Testament_canon|Development_Of_The_Old_Testament_Canon| . The  |Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern_Orthodox| ,  |Oriental_Orthodox|Oriental_Orthodox| , and  |Assyrian_Christian|Assyrian_Church_Of_The_East|  churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books. The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive: if at least one Eastern church accepts the book it is included here. The  |King_James_Bible|King_James_Bible| —which has been called the  |most_influential_version|King_James_Versioninfluence|  of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language and which in the United States is the  |most_used_translation|King_James_Versioninfluence| , being still considered a standard among  |Protestant_churches|Protestantism|  and being used liturgically in the  |Orthodox_Church_in_America|Orthodox_Church_In_America| —contains 80 books: 39 in its Old Testament, 14 in its  |Apocrypha|Biblical_Apocrypha| , and 27 in its New Testament.           |Rabbinic_Judaism|Rabbinic_Judaism|  recognizes the 24 books of the  |Masoretic_Text|Masoretic_Text| , commonly called the Tanakh or  |Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew_Bible| , as authoritative. Darshan, G. , in: M.R. Niehoff , Homer and the Bible in the Eyes of Ancient Interpreters: Between Literary and Religious Concerns , Leiden: Brill 2012, pp. 221–244 There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed: some scholars argue that it was fixed by the  |Hasmonean|Hasmonean|  dynasty , Philip R. Davies in The Canon Debate, page 50: With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty. while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later.

Most conservative scholars believe that the  |Torah|Torah|  was canonized c. 400 BCE, the  |Prophets|Neviim|  c. 200 BCE, and the  |Writings|Ketuvim|  c. 100 CE, McDonald & Sanders, page 4 perhaps at a  |Council_of_Jamnia|Council_Of_Jamnia|  as concluded by  |Heinrich_Graetz|Heinrich_Graetz|  in 1871. The Council of Jamnia theory is increasingly rejected by most scholars.    Anchor Bible Dictionary  Vol. III, pp.  634–7 . McDonald & Sanders, editors, The Canon Debate, 2002, chapter 9: Jamnia Revisited by Jack P. Lewis.                     Protestants and Catholics  use the  |Masoretic_Text|Masoretic_Text|  of the Jewish  |Tanakh|Tanakh|  as the textual basis for their translations of the  |protocanonical_books|Protocanonical_Books|  , with various changes derived from a multiplicity of other ancient sources , while generally using the Septuagint and Vulgate, now supplemented by the ancient Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts, as the textual basis for the  |deuterocanonical_books|Deuterocanonical_Books| .     The Eastern Orthodox use the  |Septuagint|Septuagint|  as the textual basis for the entire Old Testament in both protocanonical and deuteroncanonical books—to use both in the Greek for  |liturgical|Liturgical|  purposes, and as the basis for translations into the  |vernacular|Vernacular| .   Most of the quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, while differing more or less from the version presented by the Masoretic text, align with that of the Septuagint.           These books, which were largely written during the  |intertestamental_period|Intertestamental_Period| , are called the  |biblical_apocrypha|Biblical_Apocrypha|  by Protestants, the  |deuterocanon|Deuterocanon|  by Catholics, and the deuterocanon or  anagignoskomena  by Orthodox. These are works recognized by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches as being part of scripture , but Protestants do not recognize them as  |divinely_inspired|Biblical_Inspiration| . Orthodox differentiate scriptural books by omitting these from corporate worship and from use as a sole basis for doctrine.     Many recognize them as good, but not on the level of the other books of the Bible.  |Anglicanism|Anglicanism|  considers the apocrypha worthy of being read for example of life but not to be used to establish any doctrine.  |Luther|Luthers_Canon|  made a parallel statement in calling them: not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but...useful and good to read.      The difference in canons derives from the difference in the Masoretic Text and the  |Septuagint|Septuagint| . Books found in both the Hebrew and the Greek are accepted by all denominations, and by Jews, these are the protocanonical books. Catholics and Orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament with great currency among the Jews of the ancient world, with the coda that Catholics consider  |3_Esdras|3_Esdras|  and  |3_Maccabees|3_Maccabees|  apocryphal.     Most quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, differing by varying degrees from the Masoretic Text, are taken from the Septuagint. Daniel was written several hundred years after the time of Ezra, and since that time several books of the Septuagint have been found in the original Hebrew, in the  |Dead_Sea_Scrolls|Dead_Sea_Scrolls| , the  |Cairo_Geniza|Cairo_Geniza| , and at  |Masada|Masada| , including a Hebrew text of Sirach and an Aramaic text of Tobit ; the additions to Esther and Daniel are also in their respective Semitic languages.     The unanimous consensus of modern scholars consider several other books, including 1 Maccabees and Judith, to have been composed in Hebrew or Aramaic. Opinion is divided on the book of Baruch, while it is acknowledged that the Letter of Jeremiah, the Wisdom of Solomon, and 2 Maccabees are originally Greek compositions.      |Roman_Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| |Tobit_–_200_BC|Book_Of_Tobit| |_Judith_–_150_BC|Book_Of_Judith| |_Baruch|Book_Of_Baruch|  with the  |Letter_of_Jeremiah|Letter_Of_Jeremiah|  – 150–50 BC    |Sirach_–_132_BC|Book_Of_Sirach| |_1_Maccabees|1_Maccabees|  – 110 BC    |2_Maccabees|2_Maccabees|  – 110–170 BC    |Wisdom_of_Solomon_–_30_BC|Book_Of_Wisdom| |_Additions_to_Esther_–_140–130_BC|Book_Of_Estheradditions_To_Esther| |_Additions_to_Daniel|Additions_To_Daniel| |The_Prayer_of_Azariah_and_Song_of_the_Three_Holy_Children|The_Prayer_Of_Azariah_And_Song_Of_The_Three_Holy_Children|  – 200–0 BC    |Story_of_Susanna_–_200–0_BC|Susanna| |_Bel_and_the_Dragon|Bel_And_The_Dragon|  – 100 BC      |Eastern_Orthodox_Church|Eastern_Orthodox_Church| |1_Esdras|1_Esdras| /3 Esdras Including what is known as  |5_Ezra|5_Ezra|  and  |6_Ezra|6_Ezra|  ; only chapters 3–14 are denoted 4 Ezra proper in critical editions; the full book of 16 chapters is often printed as one work, 2 Esdras or 4 Esdras , in popular editions. See  |Wikipedias_article_on_the_naming_conventions_of_all_of_the_Books_of_Ezra_|Esdrasdifferences_In_Names| . The naming conventions of the various deuterocanonical and apocryphal Books of Ezra/Esdras are different in every tradition . Critical editions generally have settled on the  |Vulgate|Vulgate|  naming conventions, where Ezra and Nehemiah were 1 and 2 Esdras,  |Esdras_A|Greek_Ezra|  is 3 Esdras, and the  |Latin_Apocalypse_of_Ezra|Latin_Ezra|  is 4 Esdras .    |2_Esdras|2_Esdras| /4 Esdras    |Prayer_of_Manasseh|Prayer_Of_Manasseh| |_3_Maccabees|3_Maccabees| |_4_Maccabees|4_Maccabees| |_Psalm_151|Psalm_151| |_Odes|Book_Of_Odes| |_Syriac_Orthodox_Church|Syriac_Orthodox_Church| |_2_Baruch|2_Baruch|  with the Letter of Baruch    |Psalms_152–155|Psalms_152–155| |_Ethiopian_Tewahedo_church|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  accepts all of the deuterocanonical books of Catholicism and anagignoskomena of Eastern Orthodoxy except for the four Books of Maccabees. According to some enumerations, including Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobit, 1 Esdras, 4 Ezra , Wisdom, the rest of Daniel, Baruch, and 1-2 Maccabees It accepts the 39 protocanonical books along with the following books, called the  |narrow_canon|Bible_Translations_Into_Amharicnew_Haile_Selassie_I_Bible|  . These books are accounted pseudepigrapha by all other Christian groups, Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox The enumeration of books in the Ethiopic Bible varies greatly between different authorities and printings.       |4_Baruch|4_Baruch|  or the Paralipomena of Jeremiah    |1_Enoch|Book_Of_Enoch| |_Book_of_Jubilees|Jubilees| |_First_Second_and_Third_Books_of_Ethiopian_Maccabees|Meqabyan| |_Ethiopian_broader_Biblical_Canon|Orthodox_Tewahedo_Biblical_Canon|                  The table uses the spellings and names present in modern editions of the Bible, such as the  |New_American_Bible_Revised_Edition|New_American_Bible_Revised_Edition| ,  |Revised_Standard_Version|Revised_Standard_Version|  and  |English_Standard_Version|English_Standard_Version| . The spelling and names in both the 1609–1610  |Douay|Douay_Rheims_Bible|  Old Testament and the 1749 revision by  |Bishop_Challoner|Bishop_Challoner|  and in the Septuagint differ from those spellings and names used in modern editions that derive from the Hebrew Masoretic text. Generally due to derivation from transliterations of names used in the Latin Vulgate in the case of Catholicism, and from transliterations of the Greek Septuagint in the case of the Orthodox such  |Ecclesiasticus|Ecclesiasticus|  instead of  |Sirach|Sirach|  or  |Ben_Sira|Ben_Sira|  ,  |Paralipomenon|Paralipomenon|  instead of  |Chronicles|Books_Of_Chronicles| , Sophonias instead of  |Zephaniah|Zephaniah| , Noe instead of  |Noah|Noah| , Henoch instead of  |Enoch|Enoch| ,  |Messias|Messias|  instead of  |Messiah|Messiah| , Sion instead of  |Zion|Zion| , etc.     For the Orthodox canon, Septuagint titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. For the Catholic canon, the Douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. Likewise, the King James Version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the New Testament, such as Esaias .     In the spirit of  |ecumenism|Ecumenism|  more recent Catholic translations  use the same standardized spellings and names as Protestant Bibles in those books universally considered canonical—the  |protocanonicals|Protocanonical_Books| .     The  |Talmud|Talmud|  in  |Bava_Batra|Bava_Batra|  14b gives a different order for the books in Neviim and Ketuvim. This order is also quoted in  |Mishneh_Torah|Mishneh_Torah|  Hilchot  |Sefer|Sefer| |_Torah|Torah|  7:15. The order of the books of the Torah are universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.     The disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the  |Biblical_apocrypha|Biblical_Apocrypha| , a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern  |Protestant|Protestant|  Bibles. Catholics, following the  |Canon_of_Trent|Canon_Of_Trent|  , describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the  |Synod_of_Jerusalem_|Synod_Of_Jerusalem| , use the traditional name of  anagignoskomena , meaning that which is to be read. They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German  |Luther_Bible|Luther_Bible|  included such books, as did the English  |1611_King_James_Version|Authorized_King_James_Version| . The foundational  |Thirty_Nine_Articles|Thirty_Nine_Articles|  of  |Anglicanism|Anglicanism| , in  |Article_VI|_S_Thirty_Nine_Articles| , asserts that these disputed books are not used to establish any doctrine, but read for example of life. Although the Biblical apocrypha are still used in  |Anglican_Liturgy|Anglican_Liturgy| , , the modern trend has been to not even print the Old Testament Apocrypha in editions of Anglican-used Bibles.     Empty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.        Several of the books in the Eastern Orthodox canon are also found in the appendix to the Latin Vulgate, formerly the official Bible of the Roman Catholic Church.               In general, among  |Christian_denominations|Christian_Denominations| , the New Testament canon is an agreed-upon list of 27 books, although book order can vary. The book order is the same in the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant traditions. The  |Slavonic|Slavonic_Orthodox| ,  |Armenian|Armenian_Orthodox_Church|  and  |Ethiopian|Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church|  traditions have different New Testament book orders.
