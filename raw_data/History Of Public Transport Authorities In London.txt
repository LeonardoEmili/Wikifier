           The history of public transport authorities in London details the various organisations that have been responsible for the  |public_transport|Public_Transport|  network in and around  |London|London| , England from 1933 until 2000 and have used the  |London_Transport|London_Transport|  brand. Their responsibilities have encompassed the  |buses|Buses_In_London| ,  |coaches|Coach_Transport_In_The_United_Kingdom| ,  |trams|Trams_In_London|  and the  |London_Underground|London_Underground| . The period began with the creation of the  |London_Passenger_Transport_Board|London_Passenger_Transport_Board| , which covered the  |County_of_London|County_Of_London|  and adjacent counties within a 30-mile radius. This area later came under the control of the  |London_Transport_Executive|London_Transport_Executive|  and then the  |London_Transport_Board|London_Transport_Board| . The area of responsibility was reduced to that of the  |Greater_London|Greater_London|  administrative area in 1970 when the  |Greater_London_Council|Greater_London_Council| , and then  |London_Regional_Transport|London_Regional_Transport|  took over responsibility. Since 2000, the  |Greater_London_Authority|Greater_London_Authority|  has been the transport authority and the executive agency has been called  |Transport_for_London|Transport_For_London| ; ending the 67-year use of the London Transport name.       Prior to 1933, the ownership and management of the transport system in London was distributed among a large number of independent and separate organisations. The  |Underground|London_Underground|  railway system had been developed and was owned by the  |Underground_Electric_Railways_Company_of_London|Underground_Electric_Railways_Company_Of_London|  and the  |Metropolitan_Railway|Metropolitan_Railway| .  |Tram|Tram|  and  |Trolleybus|Trolleybus|  networks were owned by various local authorities and public companies and buses were owned by numerous companies. Many of these services were in competition with one another leading to wasteful duplication. The  |London_County_Council|London_County_Council|  managed tram operations within the  |County_of_London|County_Of_London| , but its responsibility did not extend to the bus or tram routes that ran outside its area; or to the railways, which also extended into neighbouring counties. A  |Royal_Commission_on_London_Government|Royal_Commission_On_London_Government|  in the 1920s did not permit the London County Council to extend its area of responsibility and an ad hoc  |London_Traffic_Area|London_Traffic_Area|  was created to regulate motor traffic in the wider London region. In the 1930s another ad hoc solution was sought to improve the control and coordination of public transport.                 The London Passenger Transport Board was the transport authority from 1 July 1933 to 31 December 1947.  |Day_&_Reed_2008|Reference-Day| , p. 112. It unified services in the London area for the first time. The  |London_Passenger_Transport_Act_1933|London_Passenger_Transport_Act_1933|  removed responsibility for  of tram route from the  |London_County_Council|London_County_Council| , three  |county_boroughs|County_Borough|  and a number of other local authorities in the Greater London area. It brought the UERL lines under the same control, and took over supervision of buses from the  |Metropolitan_Police|Metropolitan_Police| . The area of responsibility of the LPTB was far greater than the current  |Greater_London|Greater_London|  boundaries and was known as the London Passenger Transport Area. The period saw massive expansion of the tube network and was directly responsible for the expansion of the suburbs. The extensive  |New_Works_Programme|New_Works_Programme|  was halted by  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , with some projects abandoned and others completed after the end of hostilities. The roundel symbol designed in 1918 was adopted by London Passenger Transport Board and the  |London_Transport|London_Transport|  brand and architectural style was perfected during this period.  The iconic  |tube_map|Tube_Map|  designed in 1931, was published in 1933.          The London Transport Executive was the transport authority from 1 January 1948 to 31 December 1962.  |Day_&_Reed_2008|Reference-Day| , p. 150. London Transport was taken into public ownership and became part of the  |British_Transport_Commission|British_Transport_Commission| , which brought London Transport and  |British_Railways|British_Railways|  under the same control for the first and last time. The period saw the start of direct recruitment from the Caribbean and the repair and replacement of stock and stations damaged during the war as well as completion of delayed projects such as the  |Central_line|Central_Line|  eastern extension. The  |AEC_Routemaster|Aec_Routemaster|  bus was introduced in 1956.  |Trams|Tram|  were withdrawn in 1952 and  |trolleybus|Trolleybus| es in 1962.          The London Transport Board was the transport authority from 1 January 1963 to 31 December 1969  |Day_&_Reed_2008|Reference-Day| , p. 163. It reported directly to the  |Minister_of_Transport|Secretary_Of_State_For_Transport| , ending its direct association with the management of British Railways. During this period many of Britainâ€™s unprofitable railways were closed down, as most routes in the capital were widely used the  |Beeching_Axe|Beeching_Axe|  had little effect. However, during this period there was little investment in public transport and the motor car increased in popularity. During this period, the Victoria line was opened - although work had started in the early 1960s - and the  |AEC_Merlin|Aec_Merlin|  single-deck bus was introduced.             The Greater London Council was the transport authority from 1 January 1970 to 28 June 1984 and the executive agency was called the London Transport Executive.  |Day_&_Reed_2008|Reference-Day| , p. 172. The legislation creating the  |Greater_London_Council|Greater_London_Council|  was already passed in 1963 when the London Transport Board was created. However, control did not pass to the new authority until 1 January 1970. The GLC broadly controlled only those services within the boundaries of  |Greater_London|Greater_London| . The country buses and  |Green_Line_Coaches|Green_Line_Coaches|  had been passed in 1969 to a new company,  |London_Country_Bus_Services|London_Country_Bus_Services| , which in 1970 became part of the  |National_Bus_Company|National_Bus_Company| . The period is perhaps the most controversial in Londons transport history and there was a severe lack of funding from central government and staff shortages.     The inter-modal zonal ticketing system currently used by  |Transport_for_London|Transport_For_London|  originated in this period. Following the  |Greater_London_Council_election_in_1981|1981_Greater_London_Council_Election| , the incoming Labour administration simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named City and West End, where flat fares applied for the first time.  This was accompanied by a cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the  Fares Fair  campaign.   Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982  London Buses fares were subsequently doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three-mile intervals. In 1983, a third revision of fares was undertaken, and a new inter-modal  |Travelcard|Travelcard|  season ticket was launched covering five new numbered zones; representing an overall cut in prices of around 25%. The One Day Travelcard was launched in 1984 and on weekdays was only sold for travel after 09.30.          London Regional Transport was the transport authority from 29 June 1984 to 2 July 2000.  |Day_&_Reed_2008|Reference-Day| , p. 189. The GLC was abolished in 1986 with responsibility for public transport removed two years earlier in 1984. The new authority, London Regional Transport , again came under direct state control, reporting to the  |Secretary_of_State_for_Transport|Secretary_Of_State_For_Transport| . The London Regional Transport Act contained provision for setting up subsidiary companies to run the Underground and bus services and in 1985 London Underground Limited , a wholly owned subsidiary of London Regional Transport, was set up to manage the tube network. In 1988 ten individual line business units were created to manage the network. London Buses Limited was constituted to progress the  |privatisation_of_London_bus_services|Privatisation_Of_London_Bus_Services| . London Transport was converted to a route operating contract tendering authority, and the former bus operating interests and assets of London Transport were split into 12 business units under the banner London Buses. The 12 units competed for contracts with private operators from 1984, and were all sold off by 1994/5 becoming private operators themselves.     Further amendments to the fare system were made during this period, including inclusion of the separately managed British Rail services. In January 1985 the Capitalcard season ticket was launched, offering validity on British Rail as well as London Underground and London Buses. It was priced around 10-15% higher than the Travelcard. In June 1986 the One Day Capitalcard was launched. The Capitalcard brand ended in January 1989 when the Travelcard gained validity on British Rail. In January 1991  |Zone_5|Travelcard_Zone_5|  was split to create a new  |Zone_6|Travelcard_Zone_6| . The  |Docklands_Light_Railway|Docklands_Light_Railway|  was opened on 31 August 1987 and was included in the zonal Travelcard ticketing scheme.             The  |Greater_London_Authority|Greater_London_Authority| , a replacement authority for the GLC, was set up in 2000 with a transport executive called  |Transport_for_London|Transport_For_London|  that took control from 3 July 2000.  It is the first London transport authority since 1933 not to be commonly called London Transport. The London Underground did not pass to TfL until after a  |Private_Finance_Initiative|Private_Finance_Initiative|.
