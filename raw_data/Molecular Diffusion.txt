        Molecular diffusion, often simply called diffusion, is the thermal motion of all particles at  |temperatures|Temperature|  above  |absolute_zero|Absolute_Zero| . The rate of this movement is a function of temperature,  |viscosity|Viscosity|  of the fluid and the size of the particles. Diffusion explains the net  |flux|Flux|  of molecules from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Once the concentrations are equal the molecules continue to move, but since there is no concentration gradient the process of molecular diffusion has ceased and is instead governed by the process of  |self-diffusion|Self-Diffusion| , originating from the random motion of the molecules. The result of diffusion is a gradual mixing of material such that the distribution of molecules is uniform. Since the molecules are still in motion, but an equilibrium has been established, the end result of molecular diffusion is called a dynamic equilibrium . In a  |phase|Phase|  with uniform temperature, absent external net forces acting on the particles, the diffusion process will eventually result in complete mixing.     Consider two systems; S 1 and S 2 at the same  |temperature|Temperature|  and capable of exchanging  |particles|Molecule| . If there is a change in the  |potential_energy|Potential_Energy|  of a system; for example Î¼ 1 sub /sub  sub /sub sub /sub  ref  /ref  |up_/su|Up_/Su|  !-- Wasser should be Water in second figure. --  sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup sup /sup ref name wasser  /ref  ref  /ref  sub /sub sub /sub sub /sub sub /sub  math /math sub /sub sub /sub sub /sub math /math sub /sub sub /sub math /math math /math sub /sub  sub /sub  sub /sub .
