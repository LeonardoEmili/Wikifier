     Sextans is a minor  |equatorial|Celestial_Equator| |_constellation|Constellation|  which was introduced in 1687 by  |Johannes_Hevelius|Johannes_Hevelius| . Its name is  |Latin|Latin|  for the  |astronomical_sextant|Sextant| , an instrument that Hevelius made frequent use of in his observations.             Sextans as a  |constellation|Constellation|  covers a rather dim, sparse region of the sky. It has only one star above the  |fifth_magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude| , namely  |α_Sextantis|Alpha_Sextantis|  at 4.49 m . The constellation contains a few  |double_stars|Double_Star| , including  |γ|Gamma_Sextantis| ,  |35|35_Sextantis| , and  |40_Sextantis|40_Sextantis| . There are a few notable  |variable_stars|Variable_Star| , including  |β|Beta_Sextantis| ,  |25|25_Sextantis| ,  |23_Sextantis|23_Sextantis| , and  |LHS_292|Lhs_292| .  |NGC_3115|Ngc_3115| , an edge-on  |lenticular_galaxy|Lenticular_Galaxy| , is the only noteworthy  |deep_sky_object|Deep_Sky_Object| . It also lies near the ecliptic, which causes the  |Moon|Moon| , and some of the planets to occasionally pass through it for brief periods of time.     The constellation is the location of the field studied by the  |COSMOS_project|Cosmic_Evolution_Survey| , undertaken by the  |Hubble_Space_Telescope|Hubble_Space_Telescope| .      |Sextans_B|Sextans_B|  is a fairly bright  |dwarf_irregular_galaxy|Dwarf_Irregular_Galaxy|  at magnitude 6.6, 4.3 million  |light_years|Light_Year|  from  |Earth|Earth| . It is part of the  |Local_Group|Local_Group|  of galaxies.      |CL_J1001_0220|Cl_J1001_0220|  is as of 2016 the most distant-known  |galaxy_cluster|Galaxy_Cluster|  at  |redshift|Redshift|  z2.506, 11.1 billion light-years from Earth.      In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for  |population_III_stars|Metallicitypopulation_Iii_Stars|  in the  |Cosmos_Redshift_7|Cosmos_Redshift_7| |_galaxy|Galaxy|   found in Sextans. Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early  |universe|Universe|  , and may have started the production of  |chemical_elements|Chemical_Element|  heavier than  |hydrogen|Hydrogen|  that are needed for the later formation of  |planets|Planet|  and  |life|Life|  as we know it.
