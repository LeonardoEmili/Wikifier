With Conté as president, the CMRN set about dismantling Tourés oppressive regime, abolishing the authoritarian constitution, dissolving the sole political party and its mass youth and womens organizations, and announcing the establishment of the Second Republic. The new government released all political prisoners and committed itself to the protection of  |human_rights|Human_Rights| . In order to reverse the steady economic decline under  |Tourés|Sekou_Toure|  rule, the CMRN reorganized the judicial system, decentralized the administration, promoted private enterprise, and encouraged foreign  |investment|Investment| .     In 1990, Guineans approved by referendum a new constitution that inaugurated the Third Republic, and established a  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court| . In 1991, the CMRN was replaced by a mixed military and civilian body, the Transitional Council for National Recovery , with  |Conté|Lansana_Conté|  as president and a mandate to manage a five-year transition to full civilian rule.

Political party activity was legalized in 1992, when more than 40 political parties were officially recognized for the first time.     In December 1993,  |Conté|Lansana_Conté|  was elected to a 5-year term as president in the countrys first multi-party elections, which were marred by irregularities and lack of  |transparency|Transparency|  on the part of the government. In 1995, Contés ruling PUP party won 76 of 114 seats in elections for the National Assembly amid opposition claims of irregularities and government tampering. In 1996, President Conté reorganized the government, appointing Sidya Touré to the revived post of Prime Minister and charging him with special responsibility for leading the governments economic reform program.

Contrary to his usual practice, Conté did not appear on television to mark  |Tabaski|Tabaski|  earlier in December 2008, and this sparked renewed speculation, as well as concern about the possibility of violence in the event of his death. At around the same time, a newspaper published a photograph suggesting that Conté was in poor physical condition and having difficulty standing up. The editor of that newspaper was arrested and the newspaper was required to print a photograph in which Conté looked healthy.     According to the constitution, the President of the National Assembly was to assume the Presidency of the Republic in the event of a vacancy, and a new presidential election was to be held within 60 days. Somparé requested that the President of the Supreme Court,  |Lamine_Sidimé|Lamine_Sidimé| , declare a vacancy in the Presidency and apply the constitution. , Guinéenews, 22 December 2008 .

Calling on citizens to protest nationwide, the ensuing week saw multiple clashes between police and protesters, resulting in at least nine deaths, some of those due to live fire from security forces.       The protests were also a result of the previous months political wrangling between Condés administration and the opposition; minor protests were quelled on the street, and opposition supporters were arbitrarily arrested, prompting the resignation of two Guinean opposition ministers in September 2012.  This month also saw the opposition parties announce their stepping down from the National Transitional Council, which is effectively an interim parliament, and that they would also boycott the national electoral commission. The president of the national electoral commission, Louceny Camara, also stepped down due to pressure from the opposition over his relationship with President Condé; Camara was rumoured to be his ally and a key figure in the presidents rumoured attempts to pre-rig the legislative polls.
