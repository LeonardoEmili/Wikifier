Burkina Faso has a young age structure – the result of declining mortality combined with steady high fertility – and continues to experience rapid population growth, which is putting increasing pressure on the country’s limited arable land. More than 65% of the population is under the age of 25, and the population is growing at 3% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of infants and children, have decreased because of improved health care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an average of almost 6 children. Even if fertility were substantially reduced, today’s large cohort entering their reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic prospects of Burkina Faso’s large working-age population.       :20,107,509   :Note   :0-14 years: 44.28%   :15-24 years: 20.19%   :25-54 years: 28.82%   :55-64 years: 3.55%   :65 years and over: 3.16%     :0-14 years: 44.88%   :15-24 years: 20.07%   :25-54 years: 29.42%   :55-64 years: 3.2%   :65 years and over: 2.43%       :total: 17.4 years Country comparison to the world: 218th   :male: 16.6 years   :female: 18.2 years     :Total: 17.3 years   :Male: 17.1 years   :Female: 17.4 years       :2.76% Country comparison to the world: 12th   :3%       :36.9 births/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 14th       :8.7 deaths/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 72nd       :0 migrant/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 76th       :19.4 years   :note: median age at first birth among women 25-29     ": null
