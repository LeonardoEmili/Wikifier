                Holden, formerly known as General Motors-Holden, is an Australian carmaker and former  |automobile_manufacturer|Automobile_Manufacturer| , which imports manufactured cars under the Holden brand. It is headquartered in  |Port_Melbourne_Victoria|Port_Melbourne_Victoria| .     The company was founded in 1856 as a  |saddle|Saddle| ry manufacturer in  |South_Australia|South_Australia| . In 1908, it moved into the automotive field, becoming a subsidiary of the United States-based  |General_Motors|General_Motors|  in 1931, when the company was renamed General Motors-Holdens Ltd. It was renamed Holden Ltd in 1998, and General Motors-Holden in 2005.     In the past, Holden has offered  |badge_engineered|Badge_Engineering|  models due to sharing arrangements with  |Chevrolet|Chevrolet| ,  |Isuzu|Isuzu| ,  |Nissan|Nissan| ,  |Opel|Opel| ,  |Suzuki|Suzuki| ,  |Toyota|Toyota| , and  |Vauxhall_Motors|Vauxhall_Motors| . In previous years, the vehicle lineup consisted of models from  |GM_Korea|Gm_Korea| ,  |GM_Thailand|Gm_Thailand| , GM North America, and self-developed models like the  |Holden_Commodore|Holden_Commodore| ,  |Holden_Caprice|Holden_Caprice| , and the  |Holden_Ute|Holden_Ute| . Holden also distributed the European Opel brand in Australia in 2012 until its Australian demise in mid-2013,  and briefly the American  |Cadillac|Cadillac|  brand in 2009 until the brands full launch was delayed indefinitely.      Holden also operated assembly plants in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by  |General_Motors_New_Zealand_Limited|Holden_New_Zealand|  in an earlier and quite separate operation from Holden in Australia.     From 1994 to 2017, all Australian-built Holden vehicles were  |manufactured|Manufacturing_In_Australia|  in Elizabeth, South Australia, and engines were produced at the  |Fishermans_Bend|Fishermans_Bend|  plant in  |Melbourne|Melbourne| . Historically, production or assembly plants were operated in all mainland  |states_of_Australia|States_And_Territories_Of_Australia| . The consolidation of final assembly at Elizabeth was completed in 1988, but some assembly operations continued at  |Dandenong|Dandenong|  until 1994.     Although Holdens involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. From 2010 onwards, Holden incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and reductions of government grants and subsidies.  This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden would cease vehicle and engine production by the end of 2017.      On 20 October 2017, the last existing vehicle plant located in Elizabeth was closed as the production of the  |Holden_Commodore|Holden_Commodore|  ended.  Holden continues solely as an importer of vehicles.            In 1852,  |James_Alexander_Holden|James_Alexander_Holden|  emigrated to South Australia from  |Walsall|Walsall| ,  England, and in 1856 established J.A. Holden & Co., a saddlery business in  |Adelaide|Adelaide| .  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Henry_James_Holden|Henry_James_Holden| , became a partner and effectively managed the company.  In 1885, German-born  |H_A_Frost|H_A_Frost|  joined the business as a junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Edward_Holden|Edward_Holden| , James grandson, joined the firm in 1905 with an interest in automobiles.   From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships, and in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery.  The company began to re-body older chassis using motor bodies produced by F T Hack and Co from 1914. Holden & Frost mounted the body, and painted and trimmed it.  The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies after 1913.  After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. H.J. Holden founded a new company in late 1917, and registered Holdens Motor Body Builders Ltd on 25 February 1919, specialising in car bodies and using the former F T Hack & Co facility at 400  |King_William_Street|King_William_Street_Adelaide|  in Adelaide before erecting a large four-story factory on the site.   |Darwin_|Darwin| , p. 3.      By 1923, HMBB were producing 12,000  units per year. During this time, HMBB assembled bodies for  |Ford_Motor_Company_of_Australia|Ford_Australia|  until its  |Geelong|Geelong|  plant was completed.  From 1924, HMBB became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for GM in Australia, with manufacturing taking place at the new  |Woodville|Woodville_South_Australia|  plant.  These bodies were made to suit a number of  |chassis|Chassis|  imported from manufacturers including  |Austin|Austin_Motor_Company| ,  |Buick|Buick| ,  |Chevrolet|Chevrolet| ,  |Cleveland|Cleveland| ,  |Dodge|Dodge| ,  |Essex|Essex| ,  |Fiat|Fiat_Automobiles| ,  |Hudson|Hudson_Motor_Car_Company| ,  |Oakland|Oakland_Motor_Car_Company| ,  |Oldsmobile|Oldsmobile| ,  |Overland|Overland_Automobile| ,  |Reo|Reo_Motor_Car_Company| ,  |Studebaker|Studebaker| , and  |Willys_Knight|Willys_Knight| .       In 1926, General Motors Limited was established with assembly plants at  |Newstead_Queensland|Newstead_Queensland| ;  |Marrickville_New_South_Wales|Marrickville_New_South_Wales| ; City Road,  |Melbourne|Melbourne| ;  |Birkenhead_South_Australia|Birkenhead_South_Australia| ; and  |Cottesloe_Western_Australia|Cottesloe_Western_Australia| |_Darwin_|Darwin| , p. 7. using bodies produced by HMBB and imported  |complete_knock_down|Complete_Knock_Down|  chassis.  |Darwin_|Darwin| , p. 4. In 1930 alone, the still independent Woodville plant built bodies for Austin,  |Chrysler|Chrysler| ,  |DeSoto|Desoto| ,  |Morris|Morris_Motors| ,  |Hillman|Hillman| ,  |Humber|Humber_Limited| ,  |Hupmobile|Hupmobile| , and  |Willys_Overland|Willys_Overland| , as well GM cars. The last of this line of business was the assembly of  |Hillman_Minx|Hillman_Minx|  sedans in 1948.  The  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression|  led to a substantial downturn in production by Holden, from 34,000  units annually in 1930 to just 1,651  units one year later. In 1931, GM purchased HMBB and merged it with General Motors Pty Ltd to form General Motors-Holdens Ltd . Throughout the 1920s, Holden also supplied tramcars to the  |Melbourne_Metropolitan_Tramways_Board|Melbourne_Metropolitan_Tramways_Board| , of which several examples have been preserved in both Australia and New Zealand.          Holdens second full-scale car factory, located in  |Fishermans_Bend|Fishermans_Bend|  , was opened on 5 November 1936 by Prime Minister  |Joseph_Lyons|Joseph_Lyons| , with construction beginning in 1939 on a new plant in  |Pagewood_New_South_Wales|Pagewood_New_South_Wales| . Prime Minister Opens General Motors-Holdens Fishermens Bend Plant  Truck & Bus Transportation  December 1936 page 13 However,  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  delayed car production with efforts shifted to the construction of vehicle bodies,  |field_guns|Field_Gun| , aircraft, and engines. Before the war ended, the  |Australian_government|Government_Of_Australia|  took steps to encourage an Australian automotive industry.  Both GM and  |Ford|Ford_Motor_Company|  provided studies to the Australian government outlining the production of the first Australian-designed car. Fords proposal was the governments first choice, but required substantial financial assistance. GMs study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention.  After the war, Holden returned to producing vehicle bodies, this time for Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Vauxhall.  The  |Oldsmobile_Ace|Oldsmobile_Ace|  was also produced from 1946 to 1948.      From here, Holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an Australian car. This involved compromise with GM, as Holdens managing director,  |Laurence_Hartnett|Laurence_Hartnett| , favoured development of a local design, while GM preferred to see an American design as the basis for Australias Own Car .  |Loffler_|Loffler| , p. 5–7. In the end, the design was based on a previously rejected postwar Chevrolet proposal.  |Loffler_|Loffler| , p. 5. The Holden was launched in 1948, creating long waiting lists extending through 1949 and beyond.  |Balderstone_Bowan_Lewis_|Balderstone_Bowan_Lewis| , p. 184–188.  The name Holden was chosen in honour of Sir Edward Holden, the companys first chairman and grandson of J.A. Holden. Other names considered were GeM , Austral , Melba , Woomerah , Boomerang , Emu , and Canbra , a phonetic spelling of  |Canberra|Canberra| .  Although officially designated  |48–215|Holden_48_215|  , the car was marketed simply as the Holden .  The unofficial usage of the name FX originated within Holden, referring to the updated suspension on the 48–215 of 1953.  |Loffler_|Loffler| , p. 4.           During the 1950s, Holden dominated the Australian car market. GM invested heavily in production capacity, which allowed the company to meet increased postwar demand for motor cars. Less expensive, four-cylinder cars did not offer Holdens the ability to deal with rugged rural areas.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |50_2106|Holden_48_215| |_coupé_utility|Coupé_Utility|  from 1951; the latter was known colloquially as the ute and became ubiquitous in Australian rural areas as the workhorse of choice. Production of both the utility and sedan continued with minor changes until 1953, when they were replaced by the facelifted  |FJ|Holden_Fj|  model, introducing a third  |panel_van|Panel_Van| |_body_style|Car_Body_Style| .  The FJ was the first major change to the Holden since its 1948 introduction. Over time, it gained iconic status and remains one of Australias most recognizable automotive symbols.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |grille|Grille|  dominated the front end of the FJ, which received various other trim and minor mechanical revisions.  |Bebbington_|Bebbington| , p. 14. ...the FJ was easily identified by its bold new,  |Buick|Buick| -style grille, new  |hubcaps|Hubcap|  and new  |torpedo|Torpedo| -style tail-lights.  |Loffler_|Loffler| , p. 5. In 1954, Holden began exporting the FJ to New Zealand.  Although little changed from the 48–215, marketing campaigns and price cuts kept FJ sales steady until a completely redesigned model was launched.  At the 2005  |Australian_International_Motor_Show|Australian_International_Motor_Show|  in Sydney, Holden paid homage to the FJ with the  |Efijy|Holden_Efijy| |_concept_car|Concept_Car| .  |Carey_|Carey_1| , p. 16.     Holdens next model, the  |FE|Holden_Fe| , launched in 1956, offered in a new  |station_wagon|Station_Wagon|  body style dubbed Station Sedan in the companys sales literature.  In the same year, Holden commenced exports to  |Malaya|Federation_Of_Malaya| ,  |Thailand|Thailand| , and  |North_Borneo|North_Borneo| . Strong sales continued in Australia, and Holden achieved a market share of more than 50% in 1958 with the revised  |FC|Holden_Fc|  model.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 117. This was the first Holden to be tested on the new Holden Proving Ground based in  |Lang_Lang_Victoria|Lang_Lang_Victoria| .  In 1957, Holdens export markets grew to 17 countries, with new additions including Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore,  |Fiji|Fiji| ,  |Sudan|Sudan| , the East Africa region, and South Africa. Indonesian market cars were assembled locally by P.T. Udatin. The opening of the  |Dandenong_Victoria|Dandenong_Victoria| , production facility in 1956 brought further jobs; by 1959, Holden employed 19,000 workers country-wide.  In 1959, complete knock-down assembly began in South Africa and Indonesia.       In 1960, Holden introduced its third major new model, the  |FB|Holden_Fb| . The cars style was inspired by 1950s Chevrolets, with  |tailfins|Car_Tailfin|  and a wrap-around  |windshield|Windshield|  with dog leg  |A_pillars|Pillar| . By the time it was introduced, many considered the appearance dated. Much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact Holden.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 122. The FB became the first Holden that was adapted for  |left_hand_drive|Traffic_Directionality|  markets, enhancing its export potential, and as such was exported to  |New_Caledonia|New_Caledonia| ,  |New_Hebrides|New_Hebrides| , the  |Philippines|Philippines| , and Hawaii.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy|    In 1960,  |Ford|Ford_Australia|  unveiled the new  |Falcon|Ford_Falcon|  in Australia, only months after its introduction in the United States. To Holdens advantage, the Falcon was not durable, particularly in the front suspension, making it ill-suited for  |Australian_conditions|Environment_Of_Australia| .  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 133–134. In response to the Falcon, Holden introduced the facelifted  |EK_series|Holden_Ek|  in 1961; the new model featured two-tone paintwork and optional  |Hydramatic|Hydramatic| |_automatic_transmission|Automatic_Transmission| .  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |EJ_series|Holden_Ej|  came in 1962, debuting the new luxury oriented  |Premier|Holden_Premier|  model.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 135. The  |EH|Holden_Eh|  update came a year later, bringing the new  |Red_motor|Holden_Red_Motor| , providing better performance than the previous  |Grey_motor|Holden_Grey_Motor| .  The  |HD_series|Holden_Hd|  of 1965 had the introduction of the  |Powerglide|Powerglide|  automatic transmission.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy|  six-cylinder engine was made available.  In 1966, the  |HR|Holden_Hr|  was introduced, including changes in the form of new front and rear styling and higher-capacity engines. More significantly, the HR fitted standard front  |seat_belts|Seat_Belt| ; Holden thus became the first Australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |compact|Compact_Car|  HA series  |Vauxhall_Viva|Vauxhall_Viva|  in 1964. This was superseded by the  |Holden_Torana|Holden_Torana|  in 1967, a development of the Viva ending Vauxhall production in Australia.  Holden offered the LC, a Torana with new styling, in 1969 with the availability of Holdens six-cylinder engine. In the development days, the six-cylinder Torana was reserved for  |motor_racing|Auto_Racing| , but research had shown a business case existed for such a model.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 191–192. The LC Torana was the first application of Holdens new three-speed Tri-Matic automatic transmission.  |Bebbington_|Bebbington| , p. 103. Also introduced on the LC was the Tri-matic automatic transmission. This was GM-Hs own three-speed unit. This was the result of Holdens A$16.5  million transformation of the Woodville, South Australia, factory for its production.        Holdens association with the manufacture of Chevrolets and  |Pontiacs|Pontiac|  ended in 1968, coinciding with the year of Holdens next major new model, the  |HK|Holden_Hk|  .  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |V8_engine|V8_Engine| , a  |Chevrolet|Chevrolet|  engine imported from Canada.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Brougham|Holden_Brougham| ; and a two-door  |coupé|Coupé| , the  |Monaro|Holden_Monaro| .  |Davis_|Davis| , p. 102. The mainstream  |Holden_Special|Holden_Special|  was rebranded the  |Kingswood|Holden_Kingswood| , and the basic  |fleet_model|Fleet_Vehicle| , the  |Standard|Holden_Standard| , became the  |Belmont|Holden_Kingswood| .  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 171. On 3 March 1969,  |Alexander_Rhea|Alexander_Rhea| , managing director of General Motors-Holdens at the time, was joined by press photographers and the Federal Minister of Shipping and Transport,  |Ian_Sinclair|Ian_Sinclair|  as the two men drove the two-millionth Holden, Autocar , p. 62. an  |HK_Brougham|Holden_Brougham| , off the production line. This came just over half a decade since the one-millionth car, an  |EJ_Premier|Holden_Ej|  sedan, rolled off the Dandenong line on 25 October 1962.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 137. The millionth Holden, a Eura Gold EJ Premier sedan, passing down the Dandenong production line on 25 October 1962. Following the Chevrolet V8 fitted to the HK, the first Australian-designed and mass-produced V8, the  |Holden_V8_engine|Holden_V8_Engine|  debuted in the Hurricane concept of 1969 before fitment to facelifted  |HT_model|Holden_Ht| . This was available in two capacities:  and .  Late in HT production, use of the new Tri-Matic automatic transmission, first seen in the LC Torana was phased in as Powerglide stock was exhausted, but Holdens official line was that the HG of 1971 was the first full-sized Holden to receive it.  |Bebbington_|Bebbington| , p. 36. Tri-matic automatic transmission replaced Powerglide late in the model run .  |Bebbington_|Bebbington| , p. 38. the official introduction of the Tri-matic three-speed automatic transmission to the full-size car range.        Despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely, the Ford Falcon,  |Chrysler_Valiant|Chrysler_Valiant| , and Japanese cars—in the 1960s, Holdens locally produced large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australias top-selling vehicles. Sales were boosted by exporting the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility body styles to  |Indonesia|Indonesia| ,  |Trinidad_and_Tobago|Trinidad_And_Tobago| ,  |Pakistan|Pakistan| , the  |Philippines|Philippines| , and South Africa in complete knock-down form.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |HQ|Holden_Hq|  series in 1971.  |Strauss_|Strauss| , p. 11. At this time, the company was producing all of its passenger cars in Australia, and every model was of Australian design; however, by the end of the decade, Holden was producing cars based on overseas designs. The HQ was thoroughly re-engineered, featuring a perimeter frame and semi |monocoque|Monocoque|  construction. Other firsts included an all-coil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons, while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coil/leaf suspension configuration.  The series included the new prestige  |Statesman|Statesman|  brand, which also had a longer wheelbase, replacing the  |Brougham|Holden_Brougham| .  The Statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a Holden , but rather a Statesman .  |Luck_|Luck| , p. 62.          The HQ framework led to a new generation of two-door  |Monaros|Holden_Monaro| , and despite the introduction of the similar-sized competitors, the HQ range became the top-selling Holden of all time, with 485,650  units sold in three years;  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |HJ|Holden_Hj| , heralding new front-panel styling and a revised rear fascia.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 226. This new bodywork was to remain, albeit with minor upgrades, through the HX and HZ series.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 340–341. Detuned engines adhering to government  |emission_standards|Emission_Standard|  were brought in with the HX series, whilst the HZ brought considerably improved  |road_handling|Car_Handling|  and comfort with the introduction of radial-tuned suspension.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 239–241. As a result of GMs toying with the  |Wankel_rotary_engine|Wankel_Engine| , as used by  |Mazda|Mazda|  of Japan, an export agreement was initiated in 1975. This involved Holden exporting with  |powertrains|Powertrain| , HJ, and later, HX series  |Premiers|Holden_Kingswoodhj|  as the  |Mazda_Roadpacer_AP|Mazda_Roadpacer_Ap| . Mazda then fitted these cars with the  |13B|Mazda_Wankel_Engineap|  rotary engine and three-speed automatic transmission. Production ended in 1977, after just 840 units sold.   |McCarthy_|Mccarthy| , p. 142. ...a faction within General Motors had a serious case of the hots for  |Dr_Wankels|Felix_Wankel|  rotary engine. The Premier, in all its glory , was shipped to  |Hiroshima|Hiroshima|  where Mazda partially fitted the empty engine bay with a 13B rotor motor, backed by a three-speed auto. Production lasted just two years and 840 units... .     During the 1970s, Holden ran an advertising  |jingle|Jingle|  Football, Meat Pies, Kangaroos, and Holden cars , a localized version of the Baseball, Hot Dogs, Apple Pies, and Chevrolet jingle used by GMs Chevrolet division in the United States.  Also, development of the Torana continued in with the larger  |mid_sized|Mid_Size_Car|  LH series released in 1974, offered only as a four-door sedan.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 340. The LH Torana was one of the few cars worldwide engineered to accommodate four-, six-, and eight-cylinder engines.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 198. This trend continued until Holden introduced the  |Sunbird|Holden_Sunbird|  in 1976, essentially the four-cylinder Torana with a new name. Designated LX, both the Sunbird and Torana introduced a three-door hatchback variant.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 244. A final UC update appeared in 1978.  |Bebbington_|Bebbington| , p. 115. During its production run, the Torana achieved legendary racing success in Australia, achieving victories at the  |Mount_Panorama_Circuit|Mount_Panorama_Circuit|  in  |Bathurst_New_South_Wales|Bathurst_New_South_Wales| .           In 1975, Holden introduced the  |compact|Compact_Car| |_Gemini|Isuzu_Gemini| , the Australian version of the  |T_car|Gm_T_Platform|  , based on the  |Opel_Kadett|Opel_Kadett|  C. The Gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with Isuzu, GMs Japanese affiliate; and was powered by a 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine.  Fast becoming a popular car, the Gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class, and the nameplate lived on until 1987.      Holdens most popular car to date, the Commodore, was introduced in 1978 as the  |VB|Holden_Commodore| .  |Tuckey_|Tuckey| , p. 27. The new family car was loosely based on the  |Opel_Rekord|Opel_Rekord|  E body shell, but with the front from the  |Opel_Senator|Opel_Senator|  grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holdens sales leadership in Australia.  |Tuckey_|Tuckey| , p. 33. However, some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the cars acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers.  |Robinson_|Robinson| , p. 23, 26–27. With the abandonment of  |left_hand_drive|Left_Hand_Drive|  markets, Holden exported almost 100,000 Commodores to markets such as New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia,  |Malta|Malta|  and Singapore.     Holden discontinued the Torana in 1979 and the Sunbird in 1980. After the 1978 introduction of the Commodore, the Torana became the in-between car, surrounded by the smaller and more economical  |Gemini|Isuzu_Gemini|  and the larger, more sophisticated Commodore. The closest successor to the Torana was the  |Camira|Holden_Camira| , released in 1982 as Australias version of GMs medium-sized  |J_car|Gm_J_Platform|  .  |Robinson_|Robinson| , p. 24.               The 1980s were challenging for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried to revive the industry with the  |Button_car_plan|Button_Car_Plan| , which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 277. The decade opened with the shut-down of the  |Pagewood_New_South_Wales|Pagewood_New_South_Wales|  production plant and introduction of the  |light_commercial|Light_Commercial_Vehicle| |_Rodeo|Holden_Rodeo| , sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive  |chassis_cab|Chassis_Cab|  models with a choice of  |petrol|Gasoline|  and  |diesel|Diesel_Engine|  powerplants.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Isuzu_TF|Isuzu_Tf| . Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive  |Jackaroo|Isuzu_Bighorn|  , the  |Shuttle|Isuzu_Fargoholden_Shuttle|  van and the  |Piazza|Isuzu_Piazza|  three-door sports hatchback.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Holden_Gemini|Holden_Gemini|  from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.  |_Reborn_|Reborn_| , p. 19. We have been waiting a long time for this front wheel drive replacement for the original Gemini. The Isuzu people have not exactly been speedy signing off the development for the RB, or what has been known as the R-car... .     While GM Australias commercial vehicle range had originally been mostly based on  |Bedford|Bedford_Vehicles|  products, these had gradually been replaced by  |Isuzu|Isuzu|  products. This process began in the 1970s and by 1982 Holdens commercial vehicle arm no longer offered any Bedford products.      The new  |Holden_WB|Holden_Wb|  commercial vehicles and the  |Statesman_WB|Statesman_Wb|  limousines were introduced in 1980. However, the designs, based on the HQ and updated  |HJ|Holden_Hj| ,  |HX|Holden_Hx|  and  |HZ|Holden_Hz|  models from the 1970s were less competitive than similar models in  |Fords|Ford_Motor_Company|  lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those  |vehicle_classes|Car_Classification|  altogether in 1984. Sales of the  |Commodore|Holden_Commodore|  also fell, with the effects of the  |1979_energy_crisis|1979_Energy_Crisis|  lessening, and for the first time the Commodore lost ground to the  |Ford_Falcon|Ford_Falcon| . Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers:  |Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi_Motors_Australia| ,  |Nissan|Nissan_Motors|  and  |Toyota|Toyota|  gained market share.  When released in 1982, the  |Camira|Holden_Camira|  initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6-litre engine underpowered, and the cars build and ride quality below-average. The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holdens accumulated losses of over A$500  million by the mid-1980s.  |Robinson_|Robinson| , p. 26.          In 1984, Holden introduced the  |VK_Commodore|Holden_Commodore| , with significant styling changes from the previous  |VH|Holden_Commodore| . The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the  |VL|Holden_Commodore| , which had new front and rear styling.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Nissan_RB30|Nissan_Rb_Enginerb30|  six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine  |Wheels|Wheels|  from reporting on the matter.  The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol.  Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available. However, changing  |exchange_rates|Exchange_Rate|  doubled the cost of the engine and transmission over the life of the VL.  |Robinson_|Robinson| , p. 25. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holdens mounted losses of A$780  million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process.  |Robinson_|Robinson| , p. 27. ...on 19 December 1986 GM paid off Holdens accumulated losses of around A$780m, leaving the company free of debt. This was a new beginning, but GM insisted the company be split in two... This involved the splitting of Holden into Holdens Motor Company and Holdens Engine Company .  |Davis_Davis_|Davis_Davis| , p. 91. In December 1986, GM-H announced a major restructure of its activities replacing the existing General Motors-Holdens Ltd with two sister firms, Holdens Motor Company and Holdens Engine Company . For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at  |Elizabeth_South_Australia|Elizabeth_South_Australia| , with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in  |Port_Melbourne_Victoria|Port_Melbourne_Victoria| . The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder  Family II  engines for use in cars built overseas.  The final phase of the Commodores recovery strategy involved the 1988  |VN|Holden_Commodore| , a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre  |Buick_V6_engine|Buick_V6_Engine| .     Holden began to sell the subcompact  |Suzuki_Swift|Suzuki_Swift| -based  |Barina|Holden_Barina|  in 1985. The Barina was launched concurrently with the  |Suzuki|Suzuki| -sourced  |Holden_Drover|Suzuki_Jimnysj413_Samurai| , followed by the  |Scurry|Suzuki_Carry|  later on in 1985.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Nissan_Pulsar|Nissan_Pulsar|  hatchbacks were rebadged as the  |Holden_Astra|Holden_Astra| , as a result of a deal with Nissan.  |Earl_|Earl| , p. 29. This arrangement ceased in 1989 when Holden entered a new alliance with Toyota, forming a new company:  |United_Australian_Automobile_Industries|United_Australian_Automobile_Industries|  . UAAI resulted in Holden selling rebadged versions of Toyotas  |Corolla|Toyota_Corolla|  and  |Camry|Toyota_Camry| , as the  |Holden_Nova|Holden_Nova|  and  |Apollo|Holden_Apollo|  respectively, with Toyota re-branding the Commodore as the Lexcen.  |Earl_|Earl| , p. 27–28.             The company changed throughout the 1990s, increasing its Australian market share from 21  percent in 1991 to 28.2  percent in 1999.  Besides manufacturing Australias best selling car, which was exported in significant numbers, Holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere. In this decade, Holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles.  During 1998, General Motors-Holdens Ltd name was shortened to Holden Ltd .  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Holden_New_Zealand|Holden_New_Zealand|  announced that production at the assembly plant based in  |Trentham|Trentham_New_Zealand|  would be phased out and vehicles would be imported  |duty|Duty| -free—this came after the 1984 closure of the  |Petone|Petone|  assembly line due to low output volumes.  During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import  |tariffs|Tariff| . By 1997, the federal government had already cut tariffs to 22.5  percent, from 57.5  percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15  percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australias population was not large enough, and that the changes could tarnish the local industry.           Holden re-introduced its defunct  |Statesman|Statesman|  title in 1990—this time under the Holden marque, as the  |Statesman_and_Caprice|Holden_Caprice| . For 1991, Holden updated the Statesman and Caprice with a range of improvements, including the introduction of four-wheel  |anti_lock_brakes|Anti_Lock_Braking_System|  ;  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 343. although, a rear-wheel system had been standard on the Statesman Caprice from March 1976. ABS was added to the short-wheelbase Commodore range in 1992.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy| |Robinson_|Robinson| , p. 26–27. The  |VN_Commodore|Holden_Commodore|  received a major facelift in 1993 with the  |VR|Holden_Commodore| —compared to the VN, approximately 80  percent of the car model was new. Exterior changes resulted in a smoother overall body and a twin-kidney  |grille|Grille| —a Commodore styling trait that remained until the 2002  |VY|Holden_Commodore|  model and,  as of 2013, remains a permanent staple on HSV variants.     Holden introduced the all-new  |VT_Commodore|Holden_Commodore|  in 1997, the outcome of a A$600  million development programme that spanned more than five years. The new model featured a rounded exterior body shell, improved  |dynamics|Car_Handling|  and many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, a stronger body structure increased crash safety.  |McCarthy_McKay_Newton_Robinson_|Mccarthy_Mckay_Newton_Robinson| , p. 158. The locally produced  |Buick|Buick| -sourced  |V6_engine|V6_Engine|  powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre  |Holden_V8_engine|Holden_V8_Engine| , and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre  LS  unit.  |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy|      The UAAI badge-engineered cars first introduced in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and Corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates.  The first generation Nova and the donor Corolla were produced at Holdens  |Dandenong_Victoria|Dandenong_Victoria|  facility until 1994.  UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned to selling only GM products. The  |Holden_Astra|Holden_Astra|  and  |Vectra|Opel_Vectra| , both designed by  |Opel|Opel|  in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This came after the 1994 introduction of the  |Opel_Corsa|Opel_Corsa|  replacing the already available  |Suzuki_Swift|Suzuki_Swift|  as the source for the  |Holden_Barina|Holden_Barina| .  Sales of the full-size  |Holden_Suburban|Holden_Suburban| |_SUV|Sport_Utility_Vehicle|  sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001.  Also in 1998, local assembly of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia. These cars were exported to Japan and Southeast Asia with Opel badges.   |Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy_|Davis_Kennedy_Kennedy|        Holdens market surge from the 1990s reversed in the 2000s decade. In Australia, Holdens market share dropped from 27.5  percent in 2000 to 15.2  percent in 2006.  From March 2003, Holden no longer held the number one sales position in Australia, losing ground to  |Toyota|Toyota| .  |_Number_Crunching_|Number_Crunching| , p. 181.     This overall downturn affected Holdens profits; the company recorded a combined gain of A$842.9  million from 2002 to 2004, and a combined loss of A$290  million from 2005 to 2006.  Factors contributing to the loss included the development of an all-new model, the strong Australian dollar and the cost of reducing the workforce at the Elizabeth plant, including the loss of 1,400  jobs after the closure of the third-shift assembly line in 2005, after two years in operation.  Holden fared better in 2007, posting an A$6  million loss.  This was followed by an A$70.2  million loss in the 2008,  an A$210.6  million loss in 2009, and a profit of A$112  million in 2010.  On 18 May 2005, Holden Ltd became GM Holden Ltd , coinciding with the resettling to the new Holden headquarters on 191 Salmon Street,  |Port_Melbourne_Victoria|Port_Melbourne_Victoria| .           Holden caused controversy in 2005 with their Holden Employee Pricing television advertisement, which ran from October to December 2005. The campaign publicised, for the first time ever, all Australians can enjoy the financial benefit of Holden Employee Pricing . However, this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received. At the same time, employees were given a further discount of 25 to 29  percent on selected models.      Holden revived the  |Monaro|Holden_Monaro|  coupe in 2001. Based on the  |VT_Commodore|Holden_Commodore|  architecture, the coupe attracted worldwide attention after being shown as a concept car at Australian  |auto_shows|Auto_Show| .  The VT Commodore received its first major update in 2002 with the  |VY|Holden_Commodore|  series. A mildly facelifted  |VZ|Holden_Commodore|  model launched in 2004, introducing the  High Feature  engine.  |McCarthy_McKay_Newton_Robinson_|Mccarthy_Mckay_Newton_Robinson| , p. 159. This was built at the Fishermans Bend facility completed in 2003, with a maximum output of 900 engines per day. This has reportedly added A$5.2  billion to the  |Australian_economy|Economy_Of_Australia| ; exports account for about A$450  million alone.  After the VZ, the High Feature engine powered the all-new  |Holden_Commodore_|Holden_Commodore| . In contrast to previous models, the VE no longer used an  |Opel|Opel| -sourced  |platform|Automobile_Platform|  adapted both mechanically and in size,  |Robinson_|Robinson| , p. 34–35, 55–56. but was based on the  |GM_Zeta_platform|Gm_Zeta_Platform|  that was earmarked to become a Global RWD Architecture , until plans were cancelled due to the 2007/08  |global_financial_crisis|Global_Financial_Crisis| .          Throughout the 1990s, Opel had also been the source of many Holden models. To increase profitability, Holden looked to the South Korean  |Daewoo|Gm_Daewoo|  brand for replacements after acquiring a 44.6  percent stake—worth US$251  million—in the company in 2002 as a representative of GM.   This was increased to 50.9  percent in 2005,  but when GM further increased its stake to 70.1  percent around the time of its 2009  |Chapter_11_reorganisation|General_Motors_Chapter_11_Reorganization| , Holdens interest was relinquished and transferred to another part of GM.      The commencement of the Holden-branded Daewoo models began with the 2005  |Holden_Barina|Holden_Barina| , which based on the  |Daewoo_Kalos|Daewoo_Kalos| , replaced the  |Opel_Corsa|Opel_Corsa|  as the source of the Barina.  |Carey_|Carey_2| , p. 131. In the same year, the Viva, based on the  |Daewoo_Lacetti|Daewoo_Lacetti| , replaced the entry-level  |Holden_Astra|Holden_Astra|  Classic, although the new-generation Astra introduced in 2004 continued on.  |Carey_|Carey_3| , p. 128–129. The  |Captiva|Daewoo_Winstorm| |_crossover_SUV|Crossover_Suv|  came next in 2006. After discontinuing the  |Frontera|Holden_Frontera|  and  |Jackaroo|Isuzu_Bighorn|  models in 2003, Holden was only left with one  |all_wheel_drive|All_Wheel_Drive|  model: the  |Adventra|Holden_Adventra| , a Commodore-based station wagon.  |Ponchard_|Ponchard| , p. 106–112. The fourth model to be replaced with a South Korean alternative was the  |Vectra|Opel_Vectra|  by the mid-size  |Epica|Daewoo_Tosca|  in 2007.  |Newton_|Newton| , p. 104–108. As a result of the split between GM and  |Isuzu|Isuzu| , Holden lost the rights to use the Rodeo nameplate. Consequently, the  |Holden_Rodeo|Holden_Rodeo|  was facelifted and relaunched as the  |Colorado|Isuzu_D_Max|  in 2008.  Following Holdens successful application for a A$149  million government grant to build a localized version of the  |Chevrolet_Cruze|Chevrolet_Cruze|  in Australia from 2011, Holden in 2009 announced that it would initially import the small car unchanged from South Korea as the  |Holden_Cruze|Chevrolet_Cruze| .       Following the government grant announcement,  |Kevin_Rudd|Kevin_Rudd| , Australias  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Australia|  at the time, stated that production would support 600 new jobs at the Elizabeth facility; however, this failed to take into account Holdens previous announcement, whereby 600 jobs would be shed when production of the  Family II  engine ceased in late 2009.  In mid-2013, Holden sought a further A$265  million, in addition to the A$275  million that was already committed by the governments of Canberra, South Australia and Victoria, to remain viable as a car manufacturer in Australia. A source close to Holden informed the Australian news publication that the car company is losing money on every vehicle that it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to A$200 per week to cut costs, following the announcement of 400 job cuts and an assembly line reduction of 65 cars per day. From 2001 to 2012, Holden received over A$150 million a year in subsidy from Australian government. The subsidy from 2007 was more than Holdens capital investment of the same period. From 2004, Holden was only able to make a profit in 2010 and 2011.        In March 2012, Holden was given a $270  million lifeline by the  |Gillard_Federal_Government|Gillard_Government| ,  |Weatherill|Weatherill_Ministry|  and  |Baillieu|Baillieu_Ministry|  ministries. In return, Holden planned to inject over $1  billion into car manufacturing in Australia. They estimated the new investment package would return around $4  billion to the Australian economy and see GM Holden continue making cars in Australia until at least 2022.      Industry Minister  |Kim_Carr|Kim_Carr|  confirmed on 10 July 2013 that talks had been scheduled between the Australian government and Holden.  On 13 August 2013, 1,700 employees at the Elizabeth plant in northern Adelaide voted to accept a three-year wage freeze in order to decrease the chances of the production lines closure in 2016. Holdens ultimate survival, though, depended on continued negotiations with the Federal Government—to secure funding for the period from 2016 to 2022—and the final decision of the global headquarters in Detroit, US.      Following an unsuccessful attempt to secure the extra funding required from the new Liberal/National coalition government, on 11 December 2013,  |General_Motors|General_Motors|  announced that Holden would cease engine and vehicle manufacturing operations in Australia by the end of 2017.  As a result, 2,900 jobs would be lost over four years.  Beyond 2017 Holdens Australian presence would consist of a national sales company, a parts distribution centre and a global design studio.      In May 2014 GM reversed their decision to abandon the Lang Lang Proving Ground and decided to keep it as part of their engineering capability in Australia.      In 2015, Holden again began selling a range of Opel-derived cars comprising the  |Astra_VXR|Opel_Astra|  and  |Insignia_VXR|Opel_Insignia|  and  |Cascada|Opel_Cascada| . Later that year, Holden also announced plans to sell the European Astra and the Korean  |Cruze|Chevrolet_Cruze|  alongside each other from 2017.      In December 2015, Belgian entrepreneur  |Guido_Dumarey|Guido_Dumarey|  commenced negotiations to buy the Commodore manufacturing plant in South Australia, with a view to continue producing a rebadged Zeta-based premium range of rear and all-wheel drive vehicles for local and export sales.  The proposal was met with doubt in South Australia,  and it later came to nothing.  On 20 October 2017 Holden ceased manufacturing vehicles in Australia. Now Holden imports their cars from Opel in Germany and GM plants in Canada and USA.                     |Holden_Monaro|Holden_Monaro| |_Holden_Camira|Holden_Camira| |_Holden_Torana|Holden_Torana| |_Holden_Adventura|Holden_Commodore_Vz| |_Holden_One_tonner|Holden_One_Tonner| |_Holden_Kingswood|Holden_Kingswood| |_Holden_Brougham|Holden_Brougham| |_Holden_Special|Holden_Special| |_Holden_Astra|Holden_Astra| |_Holden_Apollo|Holden_Apollo| |_Holden_Nova|Holden_Nova| |_Holden_Vectra|Holden_Vectra| |_Holden_Zafira|Holden_Zafira| |_Holden_Combo|Holden_Combo| |_Holden_Calibra|Holden_Calibra| |_Holden_Insignia|Holden_Insignia| |_Holden_Cascada|Holden_Cascada| |_Holden_Tigra|Holden_Tigra| |_Holden_Barina|Holden_Barina| |_Holden_Cruze|Chevrolet_Cruze| |_Holden_Malibu|Holden_Malibu| |_Holden_Suburban|Holden_Suburban| |_Holden_Volt|Holden_Volt| |_Holden_Barina|Holden_Barina| |_Holden_Epica|Holden_Epica| |_Holden_Viva|Chevrolet_Optra| |_Holden_Captiva|Holden_Captiva| |_Holden_Barina|Holden_Barina| |_Holden_Jackaroo|Holden_Jackaroo| |_Holden_Rodeo|Holden_Rodeo| |_Holden_Monterey|Holden_Monterey| |_Holden_Frontera|Holden_Frontera| |_Holden_Gemini|Holden_Gemini| |_Holden_Piazza|Holden_Piazza| |_Holden_Shuttle|Holden_Shuttle| |_Holden_Drover|Holden_Drover| |_Holden_Scurry|Holden_Scurry| |_Holden_Cruze|Suzuki_Ignis| |_Holden_Barina|Holden_Barina|                On 8 May 2015 Jeff Rolfs, Holdens CFO, became interim chairman and managing director. Holden announced on 6 February 2015 that Mark Bernhard would return to Holden as chairman and managing director, the first Australian to hold the post in 25 years.  In 2010 Holden sold vehicles across Australia through the Holden Dealer Network , which employed more than 13,500  people.      In 1987 Holden established  |Holden_Special_Vehicles|Holden_Special_Vehicles|  in partnership with  |Tom_Walkinshaw|Tom_Walkinshaw| , who primarily manufactured modified, high-performance Commodore variants.  To further reinforce the brand, HSV introduced the  |HSV_Dealer_Team|Hsv_Dealer_Team|  into the V8 Supercar fold in 2005 under the naming rights of Toll HSV Dealer Team.      Holdens logo, of a lion holding a stone, was introduced in 1928. Holdens Motor Body Builders appointed  |Rayner_Hoff|Rayner_Hoff|  to design the emblem, which refers to a fable in which observations of lions rolling stones led to the invention of the wheel.  |Loffler_|Loffler| , p. 13. With the 1948 launch of the  |48–215|Holden_48_215| , Holden revised its logo. It commissioned another redesign in 1972 to better represent the company.  |Wright_|Wright| , p. 152. The emblem was reworked once more in 1994.        Holden began to export vehicles in 1954, sending the  |FJ|Holden_Fj|  to New Zealand.  |Tuckey_|Tuckey| , p. 120. Exports to New Zealand continued, but to broaden their export potential, Holden began to cater their  |Commodore|Holden_Commodore| ,  |Monaro|Holden_Monaro|  and  |Statesman_Caprice|Holden_Caprice|  models for both right- and left-hand drive markets. The Middle East was Holdens largest export market, with the Commodore sold as the  |Chevrolet_Lumina|Chevrolet_Lumina|  from 1998, and the  |Statesman|Holden_Caprice|  from 1999 as the  |Chevrolet_Caprice|Chevrolet_Caprice| . Commodores were also sold as the Chevrolet Lumina in  |Brunei|Brunei| ,  |Fiji|Fiji|  and South Africa, and as the  |Chevrolet_Omega|Chevrolet_Omega|  in Brazil.    |Pontiac|Pontiac|  in North America also imported Commodore sedans from 2008 through to 2009 as the  |G8|Pontiac_G8| . The G8s cessation was a consequence of  |GMs_Chapter_11_bankruptcy|General_Motors_Chapter_11_Reorganization|  resulting in the demise of the Pontiac brand.      Sales of the Monaro began in 2003 to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe. Later that year a modified version of the Monaro began selling in the United States as the  |Pontiac_GTO|Pontiac_Gto| , and under the Monaro name through  |Vauxhall|Vauxhall_Motors|  dealerships in the United Kingdom. This arrangement continued through to 2005 when the car was discontinued.  The long-wheelbase Statesman sales in the Chinese market as the Buick Royaum began in 2005, before being replaced in 2007 by the Statesman-based  |Buick_Park_Avenue|Buick_Park_Avenuethird_Generation| .  Statesman/Caprice exports to South Korea also began in 2005. These Korean models were sold as the  |Daewoo_Statesman|Daewoo_Statesman| , and later as the  |Daewoo_Veritas|Daewoo_Veritas|  from 2008.  Holdens move into international markets proved profitable; export revenue increased from A$973  million in 1999 to just under $1.3  billion in 2006.      From 2011 the  |WM_Caprice|Holden_Caprice|  was exported to North America as the  |_Chevrolet_Caprice_PPV|Chevrolet_Caprice| , a version of the Caprice built exclusively for law enforcement in North America and sold only to police.  From 2007 the HSV-based Commodore was exported to the United Kingdom as the  |Vauxhall_VXR8|Vauxhall_Vxr8| .      In 2013 Chevrolet announced that exports of the Commodore would resume to North America in the form of the  |VF_Commodore|Holden_Commodore|  as the  |Chevrolet_SS|Holden_Commodore|  sedan for the 2014 model year.  The Chevrolet SS Sedan was also imported to the United States for 2015 with only minor changes, notably the addition of Magnetic Ride Control suspension and a  |Tremec|Transmission_Technologies_Corporation| |_TR_6060|Tremec_Tr_6060_Transmission|  manual transmission.  For the 2016 model year the SS sedan received a facelift based on the VF Series II Commodore unveiled in September 2015.    In 2017, production of Holdens last two American exports, the SS and the  |Caprice_PPV|Holden_Caprice|  was discontinued.        |Edward_Holden|Edward_Holden| |_Laurence_Hartnett|Laurence_Hartnett|    Harold E.

Currently Holden as a full time importer, typically has had strong success with their Colorado and more recently, smaller success with Astra sedan, hatchback and wagon.                    Holden has been involved with factory backed teams in Australian touring car racing since 1968. The main factory-backed teams have been the  |Holden_Dealer_Team|Holden_Dealer_Team|  and the  |Holden_Racing_Team|Walkinshaw_Andretti_United|  . Since 2017,  |Triple_Eight_Race_Engineering|Triple_Eight_Race_Engineering|  has been Holdens factory team. Holden has won the  |Bathurst_1000|Bathurst_1000|  32 times,  more than any other manufacturer,  and has won the  |Australian_Touring_Car|Australian_Touring_Car_Championship|  and  |Supercars_Championship|Supercars_Championship|  title 20 times.  |Brad_Jones_Racing|Brad_Jones_Racing| ,  |Charlie_Schwerkolt_Racing|Charlie_Schwerkolt_Racing| ,  |Erebus_Motorsport|Erebus_Motorsport| ,  |Matt_Stone_Racing|Matt_Stone_Racing| ,  |Tekno_Autosports|Tekno_Autosports|  and  |Walkinshaw_Andretti_United|Walkinshaw_Andretti_United|  also run Holden Commodores in the series.
