   Intercalation or embolism in timekeeping is the insertion of a leap day, week, or month into some calendar years to make the calendar follow the seasons or moon phases.  |Lunisolar_calendars|Lunisolar_Calendar|  may require intercalations of both days and months.          The solar or  |tropical_year|Tropical_Year|  does not have a whole number of days , but a  |calendar_year|Calendar_Year|  must have a whole number of days. The most common way to reconcile the two is to vary the number of days in the calendar year.     In solar calendars, this is done by adding to a  |common_year|Common_Year|  of 365 days, an extra day about every four years, causing a  |leap_year|Leap_Year|  to have 366 days .     The  |Decree_of_Canopus|Decree_Of_Canopus| , which was issued by the pharaoh  |Ptolemy_III_Euergetes|Ptolemy_Iii_Euergetes|  of  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt|  in 239 BCE, decreed a solar leap day system; an Egyptian leap year was not adopted until 25 BC, when the Roman Emperor  |Augustus|Augustus|  successfully instituted a reformed  |Alexandrian_calendar|Coptic_Calendar| .     In the  |Julian_calendar|Julian_Calendar| , as well as in the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| , which improved upon it, intercalation is done by adding an extra day to February in each leap year. In the Julian calendar this was done every four years. In the Gregorian, years divisible by 100 but not 400 were exempted in order to improve accuracy. Thus, 2000 was a leap year; 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.     Epagomenal From ἐπαγόμενος, epagomenos  + -al days are days within a solar calendar that are outside any regular month. Usually five epagomenal days are included within every year , but a sixth epagomenal day is intercalated every four years in some .     The  |Baháí_calendar|Baháí_Calendar|  includes enough epagomenal days before the last month  to ensure that the following year starts on the  |March_equinox|March_Equinox| . These are known as the  |Ayyám_i_Há|Ayyám_I_Há| .       The solar year does not have a whole number of  |lunar_months|Lunar_Month|  , so a lunisolar calendar must have a variable number of  |months|Month|  in a year. Regular years have 12 months, but embolismic years insert a 13th intercalary or  leap  or  embolismic month every second or third year . Whether to insert an intercalary month in a given year may be determined using regular cycles such as the 19-year  |Metonic_cycle|Metonic_Cycle|   or using calculations of lunar phases . The  |Buddhist_calendar|Buddhist_Calendar|  adds both an intercalary day and month on a usually regular cycle.          The  |tabular_Islamic_calendar|Tabular_Islamic_Calendar|  usually has 12 lunar months that alternate between 30 and 29 days every year, but an intercalary day is added to the last month of the year 11 times within a 30-year cycle. Some historians also linked the pre-Islamic practice of  |Nasi|Nasi|  to intercalation.     The  |Solar_Hijri_calendar|Solar_Hijri_Calendar|  is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure, and hence the intercalation, with the exception that the year date starts with the  |Hegira|Hegira| .        The  |International_Earth_Rotation_and_Reference_Systems_Service|International_Earth_Rotation_And_Reference_Systems_Service|  can insert or remove  |leap_seconds|Leap_Second|  from the last day of any month . These are sometimes described as intercalary.         |ISO_8601|Iso_8601|  includes a  |specification|Iso_Week_Date| .
