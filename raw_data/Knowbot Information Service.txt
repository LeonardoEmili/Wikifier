The Knowbot Information Service , also known as netaddress, is an Internet user  |search_engine|Search_Engine|  that debuted in December 1989. Although it searched users, not content, it could be argued to be the first  |search_engine|Search_Engine|  on the Internet as it queried more than a single network for information. It provided a uniform user interface to a variety of remote directory services such as  |whois|Whois| ,  |finger|Finger_Protocol| ,  |X.500|X.500| , and  |MCI_Mail|Mci_Mail| . By submitting a single query to KIS, a user can search a set of remote white pages services and see the results of the search in a uniform format. There are several interfaces to the KIS service including  |e-mail|E-Mail|  and  |telnet|Telnet| . Another KIS interface imitates the Berkeley whois command.     KIS consists of two distinct types of modules which interact with each other to provide the service. One module is a user agent module that runs on the KIS mail host machine. The second module is a remote server module that interrogates various database services across the network and provides the results to the user agent module in a uniform fashion. Interactions between the two modules can be via messages between  |knowbot|Knowbot| .
