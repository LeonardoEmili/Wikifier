First, when the prefix bi is added to a name, a hydrogen is added to the ions formula and its charge is increased by 1, the latter being a consequence of the hydrogen ions +1 charge. An alternative to the bi- prefix is to use the word hydrogen in its place: the anion derived from  + , , can be called either bicarbonate or hydrogencarbonate.

        " family:        First, think of the -ate ion as being the base name, in which case the addition of a per- prefix adds an oxygen. Changing the -ate suffix to -ite will reduce the oxygens by one, and keeping the suffix -ite and adding the prefix hypo- reduces the number of oxygens by one more. In all situations, the charge is not affected. The naming pattern follows within many different oxyanion series based on a standard root for that particular series. The -ite has one less oxygen than the -ate, but different -ate anions might have different numbers of oxygen atoms.     These rules do not work with all polyatomic anions, but they do work with the most common ones. Following table give examples for some of these common anion groups.            The following tables give additional examples of commonly encountered polyatomic ions. Only a few representatives are given, as the number of polyatomic ions encountered in practice is very large.          ": null
