Educational perennialism also infrequently referred to as Universal Curriculum  is a  |normative_educational_philosophy|Philosophyofeducationnormativeeducationalphilosophies| .  |Perennialists|Perennialist|  believe that one should teach the things that are of everlasting pertinence to all people everywhere, and that the emphasis should be on principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, rather than machines or techniques, and about liberal, rather than vocational, topics.     Although perennialism may appear similar to  |essentialism|Educational_Essentialism| , perennialism focuses first on personal development, while essentialism focuses first on essential skills. Essentialist curricula thus tend to be much more vocational and fact-based, and far less liberal and principle-based. Both philosophies are typically considered to be  |teacher|Teacher| -centered, as opposed to student-centered philosophies of education such as  |progressivism|Educational_Progressivism| . However, since the teachers associated with perennialism are in a sense the authors of the Western masterpieces themselves, these teachers may be open to student criticism through the associated  |Socratic_method|Socratic_Method| , which, if carried out as true dialogue, involves a balance between teacher activity and student activity, with the teacher promoting discussion.       The word perennial in secular perennialism suggests something that lasts an indefinitely long time, recurs again and again, or is self-renewing. As promoted primarily by  |Robert_Hutchins|Robert_Hutchins|  and  |Mortimer_Adler|Mortimer_Adler| , a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended. This form of perennialism comprises the  |humanist|Humanism|  and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the  |University_of_Chicago|University_Of_Chicago| , where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core. Other notable figures in the movement include  |Stringfellow_Barr|Stringfellow_Barr|  and  |Scott_Buchanan|Scott_Buchanan|  ,  |Mark_Van_Doren|Mark_Van_Doren| ,  |Alexander_Meiklejohn|Alexander_Meiklejohn| , and Sir  |Richard_Livingstone|Richard_Livingstone| , an English  |classicist|Classicism|  with an American following.     Secular perennialists espouse the idea that education should focus on the historical development of a continually developing common oriented base of human knowledge and art, the timeless value of classic thought on central human issues by landmark thinkers, and revolutionary ideas critical to historical  |paradigm_shifts|Paradigm_Shift|  or changes in world view. A program of studies which is highly general, nonspecialized, and nonvocational is advocated. Travers, Paul D. and Ronald W. Rebore. Foundations of Education, Becoming a Teacher. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: 1990. P. 66. They firmly believe that exposure of all citizens to the development of thought by those most responsible for the evolution of the occidental oriented tradition is integral to the survival of the freedoms, human rights and responsibilities inherent to a true Democracy.     Adler states:   ... our political democracy depends upon the reconstitution of our schools. Our schools are not turning out young people prepared for the high office and the duties of citizenship in a democratic republic. Our political institutions cannot thrive, they may not even survive, if we do not produce a greater number of thinking citizens, from whom some statesmen of the type we had in the 18th century might eventually emerge. We are, indeed, a nation at risk, and nothing but radical reform of our schools can save us from impending disaster... Whatever the price... the price we will pay for not doing it will be much greater. Adler, Mortimer J. . The Radical Academy.       Hutchins writes in the same vein:   The business of saying ... that people are not capable of achieving a good education is too strongly reminiscent of the opposition of every extension of democracy. This opposition has always rested on the allegation that the people were incapable of exercising the power they demanded. Always the historic statement has been verified: you cannot expect the slave to show the virtues of the free man unless you first set him free. When the slave has been set free, he has, in the passage of time, become indistinguishable from those who have always been free ... There appears to be an innate human tendency to underestimate the capacity of those who do not belong to our group. Those who do not share our background cannot have our ability. Foreigners, people who are in a different economic status, and the young seem invariably to be regarded as intellectually backward ... Hutchins, Robert Maynard. Great Books: The Foundation of a Liberal Education. Simon & Schuster, New York: 1954.       As with the  |essentialists|Educational_Essentialism| , perennialists are educationally conservative in the requirement of a curriculum focused upon fundamental subject areas, but stress that the overall aim should be exposure to historys finest thinkers as models for discovery. The student should be taught such basic subjects as English, languages, history, mathematics, natural science, philosophy, and fine arts. Kneller, George F. Introduction to the Philosophy of Education. John Wiley & Sons: 1971. Adler states: The three Rs, which always signified the formal disciplines, are the essence of liberal or general education. Adler: op. cit., p. 62     Secular perennialists agree with  |progressivists|Educational_Progressivism|  that memorization of vast amounts of factual information and a focus on second-hand information in textbooks and lectures does not develop rational thought. They advocate learning through the development of meaningful conceptual thinking and judgement by means of a directed reading list of the profound, aesthetic, and meaningful  |great_books|Great_Books|  of the  |Western_canon|Western_Canon| . These books, secular perennialists argue, are written by the worlds finest thinkers, and cumulatively comprise the  |Great_Conversation|Great_Conversation|  of humanity with regard to the central human questions. Their basic argument for the use of original works is that these are the products of  |genius|Genius|  . Hutchins remarks:     Great books are great teachers; they are showing us every day what ordinary people are capable of. These books come out of ignorant, inquiring humanity. They are usually the first announcements for success in learning. Most of them were written for, and addressed to, ordinary people.     It is important to note that the Great Conversation is not static, which is the impression that one might obtain from some descriptions of perennialism, a confusion with religious perennialism, or even the term perennialism itself. The Great Conversation and the set of related great books changes as the representative thought of man changes or progresses, and is therefore representative of an evolution of thought, but is not based upon the whim or fancy of the latest cultural fads. Hutchins makes this point very clear:       In the course of history... new books have been written that have won their place in the list. Books once thought entitled to belong to it have been superseded; and this process of change will continue as long as men can think and write. It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to the Great Conversation. ...the West needs to recapture and reemphasize and bring to bear upon its present problems the wisdom that lies in the works of its greatest thinkers and in the name of love Hutchins / /blockquote blockquote ref name Hutchins / /blockquote  ref  /ref  !-- This section is linked from  |Philosophy_of_education|Philosophy_Of_Education|  --  ref  /ref   .
