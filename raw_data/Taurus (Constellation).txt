        Taurus  is one of the  |constellations|Constellation|  of the  |zodiac|Zodiac| , which means it is crossed by the plane of the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic| . Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the  |northern_hemispheres|Northern_Hemisphere|  winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the  |Early_Bronze_Age|Early_Bronze_Age|  when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring  |equinox|Equinox| . Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced  |various_bull_figures|Sacred_Bull|  in the mythologies of Ancient  |Sumer|Sumerian_Religion| ,  |Akkad|Akkadian_Religion| ,  |Assyria|Assyrian_Religion| ,  |Babylon|Babylonian_Religion| ,  |Egypt|Ancient_Egyptian_Religion| ,  |Greece|Ancient_Greek_Religion| , and  |Rome|Religion_In_Ancient_Rome| .     A number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest  |open_clusters|Open_Cluster|  to Earth, the  |Pleiades|Pleiades|  and the  |Hyades|Hyades| , both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the  |red_giant|Red_Giant| |_Aldebaran|Aldebaran|  is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the  |supernova_remnant|Supernova_Remnant| |_Messier_1|Messier_1| , more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation. The  |variable_star|Variable_Star| |_T_Tauri|T_Tauri|  is the prototype of a class of  |pre_main_sequence_stars|Pre_Main_Sequence_Star| .       Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the  |northern_hemispheres|Northern_Hemisphere|  winter sky, between  |Aries|Aries|  to the west and  |Gemini|Gemini|  to the east; to the north lies  |Perseus|Perseus|  and  |Auriga|Auriga| , to the southeast  |Orion|Orion| , to the south  |Eridanus|Eridanus| , and to the southwest  |Cetus|Cetus| . In late November-early December, Taurus reaches opposition and is visible the entire night. By late March, it is setting at sunset and completely disappears behind the Suns glare from May to July.     This constellation forms part of the zodiac and hence is intersected by the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic| . This circle across the  |celestial_sphere|Celestial_Sphere|  forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in the constellation Taurus during some part of each year. The  |galactic_plane|Galactic_Plane|  of the  |Milky_Way|Milky_Way|  intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the  |galactic_anticenter|Galactic_Anticenter|  is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as  |Goulds_Belt|Goulds_Belt|  passes through the constellation.     The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the  |International_Astronomical_Union|International_Astronomical_Union|  in 1922, is Tau . The official constellation boundaries, as set by  |Eugène_Delporte|Eugène_Joseph_Delporte|  in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 26 segments. In the  |equatorial_coordinate_system|Equatorial_Coordinate_System| , the  |right_ascension|Right_Ascension|  coordinates of these borders lie between  and , while the  |declination|Declination|  coordinates are between 31.10° and −1.35°. Because a small part of the constellation lies to the south of the  |celestial_equator|Celestial_Equator| , this can not be a completely  |circumpolar_constellation|Circumpolar_Constellation|  at any latitude.              During November, the  |Taurid|Taurid| |_meteor_shower|Meteor_Shower|  appears to radiate from the general direction of this constellation. The  |Beta_Taurid|Beta_Taurid|  meteor shower occurs during the months of June and July in the daytime, and is normally observed using radio techniques. Between 18 and 29 October, both the  |Northern_Taurids|Northern_Taurids|  and the  |Southern_Taurids|Southern_Taurids|  are active; though the latter stream is stronger.  However, between November 1 and 10, the two streams equalize.      The brightest member of this constellation is  |Aldebaran|Aldebaran| , an orange-hued,  |spectral_class|Spectral_Class|  K5  III  |giant_star|Giant_Star| . Its name derives from  ,  |Arabic|Arabic_Language|  for the follower , probably from the fact that it follows the  |Pleiades|Pleiades|  during the nightly motion of the  |celestial_sphere|Celestial_Sphere|  across the sky.  Forming the profile of a Bulls face is a V or K-shaped  |asterism|Asterism|  of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the  |Hyades|Hyades| , the nearest distinct open  |star_cluster|Star_Cluster|  after the  |Ursa_Major_Moving_Group|Ursa_Major_Moving_Group| . In this profile, Aldebaran forms the bulls bloodshot eye, which has been described as glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion , a constellation that lies just to the southwest. The Hyades span about 5° of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye. It includes a naked eye double star,  |Theta_Tauri|Theta_Tauri|   , with a separation of 5.6   |arcminutes|Arcminutes| .     In the northeastern quadrant of the Taurus constellation lie the  |Pleiades|Pleiades|  , one of the best known open clusters, easily visible to the naked eye. The seven most prominent stars in this cluster are at least visual  |magnitude|Apparent_Magnitude|  six, and so the cluster is also named the Seven Sisters . However, many more stars are visible with even a modest telescope. Astronomers estimate that the cluster has approximately 500-1,000 stars, all of which are around 100 million years old. However, they vary considerably in type. The Pleiades themselves are represented by large, bright stars; also many small  |brown_dwarfs|Brown_Dwarf|  and  |white_dwarfs|White_Dwarf|  exist. The cluster is estimated to dissipate in another 250 million years. The Pleiades cluster is classified as a Shapley class c and Trumpler class I 3 r n cluster, indicating that it is irregularly shaped and loose, though concentrated at its center and detached from the star-field.         In the northern part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of  |NGC_1514|Ngc_1514| . This  |planetary_nebula|Planetary_Nebula|  is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer  |William_Herschel|William_Herschel|  in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that  |nebulae|Nebula|  were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer  |William_Huggins|William_Huggins|  used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.     To the west, the two horns of the bull are formed by  |Beta_Tauri|Beta_Tauri|  and  |Zeta_Tauri|Zeta_Tauri| ; two star systems that are separated by 8°. Beta is a white, spectral class B7 III giant star known as El Nath, which comes from the Arabic phrase the butting , as in butting by the horns of the bull. At magnitude 1.65, it is the second brightest star in the constellation, and shares the border with the neighboring constellation of  |Auriga|Auriga| . As a result, it also bears the designation Gamma Aurigae. Zeta Tauri  is an  |eclipsing_binary|Eclipsing_Binary|  star that completes an orbit every 133 days.          A degree to the northwest of ζ Tauri is the  |Crab_Nebula|Crab_Nebula|  , a  |supernova_remnant|Supernova_Remnant| . This expanding  |nebula|Nebula|  was created by a  |Type_II_supernova|Type_Ii_Supernova|  explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak, the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe.  |North_American_peoples|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when  |John_Bevis|John_Bevis|  found it.     The star  |Lambda_Tauri|Lambda_Tauri|  is an eclipsing binary star. This system consists of a spectral class B3 star being orbited by a less massive class A4 star. The  |plane_of_their_orbit|Orbital_Plane|  lies almost along the line of sight to the Earth. Every 3.953 days the system temporarily decreases in brightness by 1.1 magnitudes as the brighter star is partially eclipsed by the dimmer companion. The two stars are separated by only 0.1  |astronomical_units|Astronomical_Unit| , so their shapes are modified by mutual tidal interaction. This results in a variation of their net magnitude throughout each orbit.          Located about 1.8° west of  |Epsilon_Tauri|Epsilon_Tauri|  is  |T_Tauri|T_Tauri| , the prototype of a class of  |variable_stars|Variable_Star|  called  |T_Tauri_stars|T_Tauri_Star| . This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between  |magnitude|Visual_Magnitude|  9 to 13 over a period of weeks or months. This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a  |main_sequence|Main_Sequence|  star. The surrounding  |reflection_nebula|Reflection_Nebula| |_NGC_1555|Ngc_1555|  is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity. To the north lies  |Kappa_Tauri|Kappa_Tauri| , a visual  |double_star|Double_Star|  consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.          This constellation includes part of the Taurus-Auriga complex, or Taurus dark clouds, a star-forming region containing sparse, filamentary clouds of gas and dust. This spans a diameter of  and contains 35,000   |solar_mass|Solar_Mass| es of material, which is both larger and less massive than the  |Orion_Nebula|Orion_Nebula| . At a distance of , this is one of the nearest active star forming regions. Located in this region, about 10° to the northeast of Aldebaran, is an asterism  |NGC_1746|Ngc_1746|  spanning a width of 45  |arcminutes|Arcminute| .                 The identification of the  |constellation|Constellation|  of Taurus with a bull is very old, certainly dating to the  |Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic| , and perhaps even to the  |Upper_Paleolithic|Upper_Paleolithic| . Michael Rappenglück of the  |University_of_Munich|University_Of_Munich|  believes that Taurus is represented in a  |cave_painting|Cave_Painting|  at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at  |Lascaux|Lascaux|  , which he believes is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades. The name seven sisters has been used for the Pleiades in the languages of many cultures, including indigenous groups of  |Australia|Australia| ,  |North_America|North_America|  and  |Siberia|Siberia| . This suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin.     Taurus marked the point of  |vernal_equinox|Vernal_Equinox|  in the  |Chalcolithic|Chalcolithic|  and the  |Early_Bronze_Age|Early_Bronze_Age| , from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation  |Aries|Aries| . The Pleiades were closest to the Sun at vernal equinox around the  |23rd_century_BC|23Rd_Century_Bc| . In  |Babylonian_astronomy|Babylonian_Astronomy| , the constellation was listed in the  |MUL_APIN|Mul_Apin|  as , The  |Bull_of_Heaven|Bull_Of_Heaven|  . It has been claimed that when the Babylonians first set up their zodiac, the vernal equinox lay in Taurus  . This is in fact incorrect: when the MUL.APIN tablets were compiled in ~1100-700 BC  , the vernal equinox was marked by the Babylonian constellation known as the hired man  . The  |Akkadian|Akkadian_Language|  name was Alu.     In the  |Old_Babylonian|Akkadian_Language|   Epic of Gilgamesh , the goddess  |Ishtar|Ishtar|  sends Taurus, the  |Bull_of_Heaven|Bull_Of_Heaven| , to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Enkidu tears off the bulls hind part and hurls the quarters into the sky where they become the stars we know as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of  |Orion|Orion| , facing Taurus as if in combat, while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with  |Inanna|Inanna| , the  |Sumerian_goddess|Mesopotamian_Religion|  of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back , there is good reason to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.     The same iconic representation of the Heavenly Bull was depicted in the  |Dendera_zodiac|Dendera_Zodiac| , an  |Egypt|Egypt| ian bas-relief carving in a ceiling that depicted the  |celestial_hemisphere|Celestial_Hemisphere|  using a  |planisphere|Planisphere| . In these ancient cultures, the orientation of the horns was portrayed as upward or backward. This differed from the later Greek depiction where the horns pointed forward. To the Egyptians, the constellation Taurus was a sacred bull that was associated with the renewal of life in spring. When the spring equinox entered Taurus, the constellation would become covered by the Sun in the western sky as spring began. This sacrifice led to the renewal of the land. To the early  |Hebrews|Hebrews| , Taurus was the first constellation in their zodiac and consequently it was represented by the first letter in their alphabet,  |Aleph|Aleph| .     In 1990, due to the  |precession_of_the_equinoxes|Precession_Of_The_Equinoxes| , the position of the Sun on the first day of summer crossed the IAU boundary of Gemini into Taurus. The Sun will slowly move through Taurus at a rate of 1° east every 72 years until approximately 2600 AD, at which point it will be in Aries on the first day of summer.     In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Taurus was identified with  |Zeus|Zeus| , who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull to abduct  |Europa|Europa| , a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation is depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as  |Io|Io| , a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife  |Hera|Hera| , Zeus changed Io into the form of a heifer. Greek mythographer  |Acusilaus|Acusilaus|  marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the  |Cretan_Bull|Cretan_Bull| , one of  |The_Twelve_Labors|Labors_Of_Hercules|  of  |Heracles|Heracles| .     Taurus became an important object of worship among the  |Druids|Druid| . Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the  |Inuit|Inuit| , the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing the spirit of the  |polar_bear|Polar_Bear| . Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay.     In  |Buddhism|Buddhism| , legends hold that  |Gautama_Buddha|Gautama_Buddha|  was born when the  |Full_Moon|Full_Moon|  was in  |Vaisakha|Vaisakha| , or Taurus. Buddhas birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or  |Vesākha|Vesākha| , which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.          , the Sun appears in the constellation Taurus from May 13 to June 21. In  |tropical_astrology|Tropical_Astrology| , the Sun is considered to be in the sign  |Taurus|Taurus|  from April 20 to May 20.       The  |space_probe|Space_Probe|   Pioneer 10  is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its batteries will be long dead.       Several stars in Hyades cluster include  |Kappa_Tauri|Kappa_Tauri|  were photographed during  |Solar_eclipse_of_May_29_1919|Solar_Eclipse_Of_May_29_1919|  by the expedition of  |Arthur_Eddington|Arthur_Eddington|  in  |Príncipe|Príncipe|  and others in  |Sobral_Brazil|Sobral_Ceará|  that  |confirmed|Tests_Of_General_Relativity| |Albert_Einsteins|Albert_Einstein|  prediction of the  |bending_of_light|Gravitational_Lens|  around the  |Sun|Sun|  from his  |general_theory_of_relativity|General_Theory_Of_Relativity|  which he published in 1915.
