      Saint Lucia  is one of many small land masses composing the insular group known as the  |Windward_Islands|Windward_Islands| . Unlike large limestone areas such as  |Florida|Florida| ,  |Cuba|Cuba| , and the  |Yucatan_Peninsula|Yucatan_Peninsula| , or the  |Bahamas|Bahamas| , which is a small island group composed of coral and sand, St. Lucia is a typical Windward Island formation of  |volcanic|Volcanic|  rock that came into existence long after much of the region had already been formed.     St. Lucias physical features are notable. Dominated by high peaks and rain forests in the interior, the  island is known for the twin peaks of  |Gros_Piton|Gros_Piton|  and  |Petit_Piton|Petit_Piton|  on the southwestern coast, its soft sandy beaches, and its magnificent natural harbors.  |Mount_Gimie|Mount_Gimie| , the highest peak, is located in the central mountain range and rises to  above sea level, a contrast that is also evident in the abrupt climatic transition from coastal to inland areas. The steep terrain also accentuates the many rivers that flow from central St. Lucia to the Caribbean. Fertile land holdings, which support banana farming, are scattered throughout the island.     St. Lucia has a tropical, humid climate moderated by northeast trade winds that allow for pleasant year-round conditions. Mean annual temperatures range from  to  at sea level and drop to an average of  in the mountain peaks. The abundant annual rainfall accumulates to approximately , with most precipitation occurring during the June to December wet season. Hurricanes are the most severe climatic disturbance in this area and have been known to cause extensive damage. Although St. Lucia has historically been spared from serious hurricane destruction,  |Hurricane_Allen|Hurricane_Allen|  decimated the agricultural sector and claimed nine lives in 1980. More recently, in 2010, Hurricane Tomas claimed seven lives and also caused extensive agricultural damage, particularly to the islands burgeoning cocoa crop.           Coordinates:      Saint Lucia is in the  |Caribbean|Caribbean| , an island between the  |Caribbean_Sea|Caribbean_Sea|  and North  |Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic_Ocean| , north of  |Saint_Vincent|Saint_Vincent_And_The_Grenadines|  and north-west of  |Barbados|Barbados| .

Since it is fairly close to the equator, and the surrounding sea surface temperature only fluctuates 3°C the coastal air temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer. The dry season is from December to June, and the rainy season is from June to November. Average daytime temperatures are around , and average night time temperatures are around . Average annual rainfall ranges from  on the coast to  in the mountain rainforests.       Volcanic and mountainous with some broad, fertile valleys.

The island was severely affected by  |Hurricane_Allen|Hurricane_Allen|  in 1980 and  |Hurricane_Tomas|Hurricane_Tomas|  in 2010, causing agricultural damage and a drop in visitor arrivals, but Saint Lucia has generally had fewer hurricanes than many other Caribbean islands, due to its southerly location. Hurricanes and volcanoes would both damage the coral.           Deforestation; soil erosion, particularly in the northern region.       party to:    |Biodiversity|Biodiversity| ,  |Climate_Change|United_Nations_Framework_Convention_On_Climate_Change| ,  |Desertification|Desertification| ,  |Endangered_Species|Endangered_Species| ,  |Environmental_Modification|Environmental_Modification| ,  |Hazardous_Wastes|Hazardous_Wastes| ,  |Law_of_the_Sea|Law_Of_The_Sea| ,  |Marine_Dumping|Marine_Dumping| ,  |Ozone_Layer_Protection|Ozone_Layer_Protection| ,  |Whaling|Whaling| ,  |Climate_Change-Kyoto_Protocol|Climate_Change-Kyoto_Protocol|.
