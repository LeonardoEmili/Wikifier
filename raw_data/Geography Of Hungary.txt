|Hungary|Hungary|  is a  |landlocked|Landlocked|  country in  |East_Central_Europe|East_Central_Europe|  with a land area of 93,030 square km. It measures about 250  km from north to south and 524  km from east to west. It has 2,106  km of boundaries, shared with  |Austria|Austria|  to the west,  |Serbia|Serbia| ,  |Croatia|Croatia|  and  |Slovenia|Slovenia|  to the south and southwest,  |Romania|Romania|  to the southeast,  |Ukraine|Ukraine|  to the northeast, and  |Slovakia|Slovakia|  to the north.     Hungarys modern borders were first established after  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  when, by the terms of the  |Treaty_of_Trianon|Treaty_Of_Trianon|  in 1920, it lost more than 71% of what had formerly been the  |Kingdom_of_Hungary|Kingdom_Of_Hungary| , 58.5% of its population, and 32% of the Hungarians. The country secured some boundary revisions from 1938 to 1941: In 1938 the  |First_Vienna_Award|First_Vienna_Award|  gave back territory from  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia| , in 1939 Hungary occupied  |Carpatho_Ukraine|Carpatho_Ukraine| . In 1940 the  |Second_Vienna_Award|Second_Vienna_Award|  gave back  |Northern_Transylvania|Northern_Transylvania|  and finally Hungary occupied the  |Bácska|Bačka|  and  |Muraköz|Međimurje_County|  regions during the  |Invasion_of_Yugoslavia|Invasion_Of_Yugoslavia| . However, Hungary lost these territories again with its defeat in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . After World War II, the Trianon boundaries were restored with a small revision that benefited Czechoslovakia.     Most of the country has an elevation of less than 200 m. Although Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains, those reaching heights of 300 m or more cover less than 2% of the country. The highest point in the country is  |Kékes|Kékes|  in the  |Mátra_Mountains|Mátra|  northeast of  |Budapest|Budapest| . The lowest spot is 77.6 m above sea level, located in the south of Hungary, near  |Szeged|Szeged| .     The major rivers in the country are the  |Danube|Danube|  and  |Tisza|Tisza| . The Danube is navigable within Hungary for 418 kilometers. The Tisza River is navigable for 444  km in the country. Less important rivers include the  |Drava|Drava|  along the Croatian border, the  |Rába|Rába| , the  |Szamos|Someș| , the  |Sió|Sió| , and the  |Ipoly|Ipeľ|  along the Slovakian border. Hungary has three major lakes.  |Lake_Balaton|Lake_Balaton| , the largest, is 78  km long and from 3 to 14  km wide, with an area of 600 square km  . Hungarians often refer to it as the Hungarian Sea. It is Central Europes largest  |freshwater|Freshwater|  lake and an important recreation area. Its shallow waters offer good summer swimming, and in winter its frozen surface provides excellent opportunities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water are  |Lake_Velence|Lake_Velence|  in Fejér County and Lake Fertő , and the artificial  |Lake_Tisza|Lake_Tisza| .     Hungary has three major geographic regions : the  |Great_Alföld|Great_Alföld| , lying east of the Danube River; the  |Transdanubia|Transdanubia| , a hilly region lying west of the Danube and extending to the Austrian foothills of the  |Alps|Alps| ; and the  |North_Hungarian_Mountains|North_Hungarian_Mountains| , which is a mountainous and hilly country beyond the northern boundary of the Great Hungarian Plain.     The countrys best natural resource is fertile land, although soil quality varies greatly. About 70% of the countrys total territory is suitable for agriculture; of this portion, 72% is arable land. Hungary lacks extensive domestic sources of energy and raw materials needed for industrial development.          :: Main articles: Little Hungarian Plain , Transdanubia , Great Alföld .        The Little Alföld or Little Hungarian Plain is a plain of approximately 8,000  km 2 in northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and eastern Austria, along the lower course of the  |Rába|Rába|  River, with high quality fertile soils.     The Transdanubia region lies in the western part of the country, bounded by the Danube River, the Drava River, and the remainder of the countrys border with Slovenia and Croatia. It lies south and west of the course of the Danube. It contains Lake Fertő and Lake Balaton. The region consists mostly of rolling hills. Transdanubia is primarily an agricultural area, with flourishing crops, livestock, and viticulture. Mineral deposits and oil are found in  |Zala_county|Zala_County|  close to the border of Croatia.     The Great Alföld contains the basin of the Tisza River and its branches. It encompasses more than half of the countrys territory. Bordered by mountains on all sides, it has a variety of terrains, including regions of fertile soil, sandy areas, wastelands, and swampy areas. Hungarians have inhabited the Great Plain for at least a millennium. Here is found the  |puszta|Puszta| , a long, and uncultivated expanse , with which much Hungarian folklore is associated. In earlier centuries, the Great Plain was unsuitable for farming because of frequent flooding. Instead, it was the home of massive herds of cattle and horses. In the last half of the 19th century, the government sponsored programs to control the riverways and expedite inland drainage in the Great Plain. With the danger of recurrent flooding largely eliminated, much of the land was placed under cultivation, and herding ceased to be a major contributor to the areas economy.       :: Main articles: Alpokalja , Transdanubian Mountains , Mecsek , North Hungarian Mountains .     Although the majority of the country has an elevation lesser than 300 m, Hungary has several moderately high ranges of mountains. They can be classified to four geographic regions, from west to east:  |Alpokalja|Alpokalja| ,  |Transdanubian_Mountains|Transdanubian_Mountains| ,  |Mecsek|Mecsek|  and  |North_Hungarian_Mountains|North_Hungarian_Mountains| . Alpokalja  is located along the  |Austria|Austria| n border; its highest point is  |Írott_kő|Írott_Kő|  with an elevation of 882 metres. The Transdanubian Mountains stretch from the west part of  |Lake_Balaton|Lake_Balaton|  to the  |Danube_Bend|Danube_Bend|  near  |Budapest|Budapest| , where it meets the North Hungarian Mountains. Its tallest peak is the 757 m high  |Pilis|Pilis| .  |Mecsek|Mecsek|  is the southernmost Hungarian mountain range, located north from  |Pécs|Pécs|  - Its highest point is the  |Zengő|Zengő|  with 682 metres.     The North Hungarian Mountains lie north of Budapest and run in a northeasterly direction south of the border with Slovakia. The higher ridges, which are mostly forested, have rich coal and iron deposits. Minerals are a major resource of the area and have long been the basis of the industrial economies of cities in the region. Viticulture is also important, producing the famous  |Tokaji|Tokaji|  wine. The highest peak of it is the  |Kékes|Kékes| , located in the  |Mátra|Mátra|  mountain range.                       Hungary has a mainly  |continental_climate|Continental_Climate| , with cold winters and warm to hot summers. The average annual temperature is about , in summer , and in winter , with extremes ranging from about  in summer to  in winter. Average yearly rainfall is about . Distribution and frequency of rainfall are unpredictable. The western part of the country usually receives more rain than the eastern part, where severe droughts may occur in summertime. Weather conditions in the Great Plain can be especially harsh, with hot summers, cold winters, and scant rainfall.     By the 1980s, the countryside was beginning to show the effects of pollution, both from herbicides used in agriculture and from industrial pollutants. Most noticeable was the gradual contamination of the countrys bodies of water, endangering fish and wildlife. Although concern was mounting over these disturbing threats to the environment, no major steps had yet been taken to arrest them.                                   Hungary, with its plains and hilly regions, is highly suitable for agriculture.       Doubtless, one of Hungarys most important natural resources is  |arable_land|Arable_Land| . It covers about 48.57% of the country, which is outstanding in the world . The mass majority of the  |fertile_soil|Fertile_Soil|  has a good quality.     The most important agricultural zones are the  |Little_Hungarian_Plain|Little_Hungarian_Plain|  ,  |Transdanubia|Transdanubia| , and the  |Great_Hungarian_Plain|Great_Hungarian_Plain| . The last covers more than half of the country , whereas soil quality varies extremely; the territory even contains a small, grassy  |semi_desert|Semi_Desert| , the so-called  |puszta|Puszta|  . Puszta is exploited by  |sheep|Sheep|  and  |cattle|Cattle|  raising.     The most important Hungarian agricultural products include  |corn|Maize| ,  |wheat|Wheat| ,  |barley|Barley| ,  |oat|Oat| ,  |sunflower|Sunflower| ,  |poppy|Poppy| ,  |potato|Potato| ,  |millet|Millet| ,  |sugar_beet|Beet| ,  |flax|Flax| , and many other plants. There are also some newly naturalized plants too, for example  |amaranth|Amaranth| .  |Poppy_seed|Poppy_Seed|  is part of the traditional  |Hungarian_cuisine|Hungarian_Cuisine| .      The country is well known for producing high quality  |peppers|Capsicum_Annuum| , which are often made into  |paprika|Paprika| . There are numerous fruits reared, including many subspecies of  |apple|Apple| ,  |pear|Pear| ,  |peach|Peach| ,  |grape|Grape| ,  |apricot|Apricot| ,  |watermelon|Watermelon| ,  |cantaloupe|Cantaloupe| , etc.     Hungary does not grow any  |GMO|Genetically_Modified_Organism|  products, thus these products are mainly imported from the  |United_States|United_States| . They cannot, however, be distributed without a mark on the wrapping.       Wine production has a long history in Hungary. There are two languages in  |Europe|Europe|  in which the word for wine does not derive from the  |Latin|Latin_Language| , being  |Greek|Greek_Language|    and  |Hungarian|Hungarian_Language| . The Hungarian word is bor.     Viticulture has been recorded in the territory of todays Hungary since the Roman times, who were responsible for the introduction of the cultivation of wines. The arriving Hungarians took over the practice and have maintained it ever since.     Today, there are numerous wine regions in Hungary, producing quality and inexpensive wines as well, comparable to Western European ones. The majority of the countrys wine regions are located in the mountains or in the hills, such as  |Transdanubian_Mountains|Transdanubian_Mountains| ,  |North_Hungarian_Mountains|North_Hungarian_Mountains| ,  |Villány_Mountains|Villány_Mountains| , and so on. Important ones include the regions of  |Eger|Eger| ,  |Hajós|Hajós| ,  |Somló|Somló| ,  |Sopron|Sopron| ,  |Villány|Villány| ,  |Szekszárd|Szekszárd| , and  |Tokaj_Hegyalja|Tokaj_Hegyalja| .       19% of the country is covered by  |forests|Forest| . These are mainly mountainous areas, such as the North Hungarian and the Transdanubian Mountains, and the  |Alpokalja|Alpokalja| . The composition of forests is various, with trees like  |fir|Fir| ,  |beech|Beech| ,  |oak|Oak| ,  |willow|Willow| ,  |acacia|Acacia| ,  |plane|Platanus| , etc.             Hungarys current  |counties|Counties_Of_Hungary|  are largely based on the countrys historic regions. The counties are subdivided into  district s , and these are further divided into  municipalities  . Hungary has 19 counties, 174 districts + 23  |districts_in_Budapest|List_Of_Districts_In_Budapest|  and 2,722 municipality.         country comparison to the world:  |108th|List_Of_Sovereign_States_And_Dependencies_By_Area|  Land boundaries: total: 2,009  km .
