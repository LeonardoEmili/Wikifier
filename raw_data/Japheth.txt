     Japheth  , is one of the three  |sons_of_Noah|Sons_Of_Noah|  in the  |Book_of_Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis| , where he plays a role in the story of Noahs drunkenness and the  |curse_of_Ham|Curse_Of_Ham| , and subsequently in the  |Table_of_Nations|Table_Of_Nations|  as the ancestor of the peoples of the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea| ,  |Anatolia|Anatolia| , and elsewhere. In medieval and early modern European tradition he was considered to be the progenitor of European and, later, East Asian peoples.  |Susan_Reynolds|Susan_Reynolds| , Medieval origines gentium and the community of the realm, History, 68, 1983, pp. 375-90 Ivane Javakhishvili.

There are two possible sources to the meaning of the name.    From Aramaic root , meaning to extend. In this case, the name would mean may He extend .   From Hebrew root , meaning beauty, in which case the name would mean beautiful.       Japheth first appears in the Book of Genesis as one of the three sons of Noah, saved through the  |Ark|Genesis_Flood_Narrative| . They are always in the order Shem, Ham, and Japheth when all three are listed , but Genesis 9:24 calls  |Ham|Ham|  the youngest, and Genesis 10:21 refers ambiguously to Shem as brother of Japheth the elder, which could mean that either is the eldest. Most modern writers accept Shem-Ham-Japheth as reflecting birth order, but this is not always the case: Moses and Rachel also appear at the head of such lists despite explicit descriptions of them as younger siblings.     Following the Flood he features in the story of Noahs drunkenness. Ham sees Noah drunk and naked in his tent and tells his brothers, who then cover their father with a cloak while avoiding the sight; when Noah awakes he  |curses_Canaan|Curse_Of_Canaan| , the son of Ham, and blesses Shem and Japheth: Blessed be the Lord God of Shem and may Canaan be his slave; and may God enlarge Japheth and may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave!” .     Chapter 10 of Genesis, the  |Table_of_Nations|Table_Of_Nations| , tells how the entire Earth was populated by the sons of Noah following the Flood, beginning with the descendants of Japheth:                              The  |Book_of_Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis|  is the first of the five books of the  |Torah|Torah| , that contains the account of Israels origins as a people. Scholars increasingly see this as a product of the  |Achaemenid_Empire|Achaemenid_Empire|  , although some would place its production in the  |Hellenistic_period|Hellenistic_Period|  or even the  |Hasmonean_dynasty|Hasmonean_Dynasty|  . The story of Japheth and his brothers may be even more recent: almost none of the persons, places and stories in the first eleven chapters of Genesis  are ever mentioned anywhere else in the Bible, leading scholars to suppose that the history is a late composition, attached to Genesis to serve as an introduction to that book and to the Torah.     Japheth is a transliteration of the Greek  |Iapetos|Iapetus| , the ancestor of the Hellenic peoples. His sons and grandsons associate him with the geographic area of the eastern Mediterranean and Asia — Ionia/Javan, Rhodes/Rodanim, Cyprus/Kittim, and other points in the region of Greece and Asia Minor — approximating to one of the three kingdoms into which the generals of Alexander the Great divided his empire on his death .  The point of the blessing of Japheth seems to be that Japheth and Shem would rule jointly over Canaan . From the 19th century until the late 20th century it was usual to see Japheth as a reference to the  |Philistines|Philistines| , who shared dominion over Canaan during the pre-monarchic and early monarchic period of Israels history. This view accorded with earlier understanding of the origin of the Book of Genesis, which was seen as having been composed in stages beginning with the time of  |Solomon|Solomon| , when the Philistines still existed . However, Genesis 10:14 identifies their ancestor as Ham rather than Japheth.                For those who take the  |genealogies_of_Genesis|Genealogies_Of_Genesis|  to be  |historically_accurate|Biblical_Literalism| , Japheth is commonly believed to be the father of Europeans. The link between Japheth and the Europeans stems from  |Genesis|Book_Of_Genesis|  10:5, which states:          According to that book, Japheth and his two  |brothers|Brother|  formed the three major  |races|Race| |Japhetic_race|Japhetites| |Shem|Shem|  is the father of the  |Semitic_race|Semitic_People| |Ham|Ham|  is the father of the  |Hamitic_race|Hamitic| |William_Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|  play  Henry IV, Part II  contains a wry comment about people who claim to be related to royal families.  |Prince_Hal|Prince_Hal|  notes of such people,                    In the Bible, Japheth is ascribed seven sons:  |Gomer|Gomer| ,  |Magog|Magog| ,  |Tiras|Tiras| ,  |Javan|Javan| ,  |Meshech|Meshech| ,  |Tubal|Tubal| , and  |Madai|Madai| . According to  |Josephus|Josephus|       Josephus subsequently detailed the nations supposed to have descended from the seven sons of Japheth.     The  |Book_of_Jasher|Sefer_Hayashar|  , published by Talmudic rabbis in the 17th century, provides some new names for Japheths grandchildren not found in the Bible, and provided a much more detailed genealogy .       In the seventh century,  |Isidore_of_Seville|Isidore_Of_Seville|  published his noted history, in which he traces the origins of most of the nations of Europe back to Japheth.   Scholars in almost every European nation continued to repeat and develop Saint Isidores assertion of descent from Noah through Japheth into the nineteenth century.      |Ivane_Javakhishvili|Ivane_Javakhishvili|  associated Japheths sons with certain ancient tribes, called  |Tubals|Tubal|   and  |Meshechs|Meshech|  , who they claim represent non-Indo-European and non-Semitic, possibly Proto-Iberian tribes of  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  of the  |3rd|3Rd_Millennium_Bc| - |1st_millennia_BC|1St_Millennium_Bc| .     In the Polish tradition of  |Sarmatism|Sarmatism| , the Sarmatians, an  |Iranic_people|Iranian_Peoples| , were said to be descended from Japheth, son of  |Noah|Noah| , enabling the Polish nobility to imagine themselves able to trace their ancestry directly to Noah.     In Scotland, histories tracing the  |Scottish_people|Scottish_People|  to Japheth were published as late as  |George_Chalmers|George_Chalmers|  well-received Caledonia, published in 3 volumes from 1807 to 1824.  |Colin_Kidd|Colin_Kidd| , British Identities before Nationalism; Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 52       Japheth is not mentioned by name in the  |Quran|Quran|  but is referred to indirectly in the narrative of  |Noah|Noah|  .  |Muslim|Muslim| |exegesis|Exegesis| , however, names all of Noahs sons, and these include Japheth.
