      In  |geometry|Geometry| , an octahedron is a  |polyhedron|Polyhedron|  with eight faces, twelve edges, and six vertices. The term is most commonly used to refer to the regular octahedron, a  |Platonic_solid|Platonic_Solid|  composed of eight  |equilateral_triangles|Equilateral_Triangle| , four of which meet at each  |vertex|Wikt:Vertex| .     A regular octahedron is the  |dual_polyhedron|Dual_Polyhedron|  of a  |cube|Cube| . It is a  |rectified|Rectification| |tetrahedron|Tetrahedron| . It is a square  |bipyramid|Bipyramid|  in any of three  |orthogonal|Orthogonal|  orientations. It is also a triangular  |antiprism|Antiprism|  in any of four orientations.     An octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a  |cross_polytope|Cross_Polytope| .     A regular octahedron is a  |3-ball|N-Ball|  in the  |Manhattan_metric|Taxicab_Geometry| .           If the edge length of a regular octahedron is a, the  |radius|Radius|  of a circumscribed  |sphere|Sphere|  is   : ru   a   0.707   a     and the radius of an inscribed sphere  is   : ri   a   0.408  a     while the midradius, which touches the middle of each edge, is   : rm   a 0.5  a       The octahedron has four special  |orthogonal_projections|Orthogonal_Projection| , centered, on an edge, vertex, face, and normal to a face. The second and third correspond to the B 2 and A 2  |Coxeter_planes|Coxeter_Plane| .          The octahedron can also be represented as a  |spherical_tiling|Spherical_Tiling| , and projected onto the plane via a  |stereographic_projection|Stereographic_Projection| . This projection is  |conformal|Conformal_Map| , preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.            An octahedron with edge length  can be placed with its center at the origin and its vertices on the coordinate axes; the  |Cartesian_coordinates|Cartesian_Coordinates|  of the vertices are then   : ;   : ;   : .     In an x–y–z  |Cartesian_coordinate_system|Cartesian_Coordinate_System| , the octahedron with center  |coordinates|Coordinate_System|   and radius r is the set of all points  such that   :   - a  +   - b  +   - c  r.       The surface area A and the  |volume|Volume|  V of a regular octahedron of edge length a are:   : A2    3.464a2   : V      0.471a3     Thus the volume is four times that of a regular  |tetrahedron|Tetrahedron|  with the same edge length, while the surface area is twice .     If an octahedron has been stretched so that it obeys the equation   :   1,     the formulas for the surface area and volume expand to become   : A4   xm   ym   zm       : V      Additionally the inertia tensor of the stretched octahedron is   :   I         m & 0 & 0     0 &   m & 0     0 & 0 &   m           These reduce to the equations for the regular octahedron when   : xmymzma           The interior of the  |compound|Polyhedral_Compound|  of two dual  |tetrahedra|Tetrahedra|  is an octahedron, and this compound, called the  |stella_octangula|Stella_Octangula| , is its first and only  |stellation|Stellation| . Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size . The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the  |cuboctahedron|Cuboctahedron|  and  |icosidodecahedron|Icosidodecahedron|  relate to the other Platonic solids. One can also divide the edges of an octahedron in the ratio of the  |golden_mean|Golden_Ratio|  to define the vertices of an  |icosahedron|Icosahedron| . This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedrons edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. There are five octahedra that define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together they define a regular compound.      |Octahedra_and_tetrahedra|Tetrahedral-Octahedral_Honeycomb|  can be alternated to form a vertex, edge, and face-uniform  |tessellation_of_space|Tessellation_Of_Space| , called the  |octet_truss|Octet_Truss|  by  |Buckminster_Fuller|Buckminster_Fuller| . This is the only such tiling save the regular tessellation of  |cubes|Cube| , and is one of the 28  |convex_uniform_honeycombs|Convex_Uniform_Honeycomb| . Another is a tessellation of octahedra and  |cuboctahedra|Cuboctahedra| .     The octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having an even number of faces meeting at each vertex. Consequently, it is the only member of that group to possess mirror planes that do not pass through any of the faces.     Using the standard nomenclature for  |Johnson_solids|Johnson_Solid| , an octahedron would be called a square bipyramid. Truncation of two opposite vertices results in a  |square_bifrustum|Square_Bifrustum| .     The octahedron is  |4-connected|K-Vertex-Connected_Graph| , meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected  |simplicial|Simplicial_Polytope| |well-covered|Well-Covered_Graph|  polyhedra, meaning that all of the  |maximal_independent_sets|Maximal_Independent_Set|  of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the  |pentagonal_dipyramid|Pentagonal_Dipyramid| , the  |snub_disphenoid|Snub_Disphenoid| , and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.        There are 3  |uniform_colorings|Uniform_Coloring|  of the octahedron, named by the triangular face colors going around each vertex: 1212, 1112, 1111.     The octahedrons  |symmetry_group|Symmetry_Group|  is O h , of order 48, the three dimensional  |hyperoctahedral_group|Hyperoctahedral_Group| . This groups  |subgroups|Subgroup|  include D 3d , the symmetry group of a triangular  |antiprism|Antiprism| ; D 4h  , the symmetry group of a square  |bipyramid|Bipyramid| ; and T d , the symmetry group of a  |rectified_tetrahedron|Octahedrontetratetrahedron| . These symmetries can be emphasized by different colorings of the faces.          It has eleven arrangements of  |nets|Net| .       The octahedron is the  |dual_polyhedron|Dual_Polyhedron|  to the  |cube|Cube| .   :       The uniform  |tetrahemihexahedron|Tetrahemihexahedron|  is a  |tetrahedral_symmetry|Tetrahedral_Symmetry| |faceting|Faceting|  of the regular octahedron, sharing  |edge|Edge_Arrangement|  and  |vertex_arrangement|Vertex_Arrangement| . It has four of the triangular faces, and 3 central squares.          The following polyhedra are combinatorially equivalent to the regular polyhedron. They all have six vertices, eight triangular faces, and twelve edges that correspond one-for-one with the features of a regular octahedron.   Triangular antiprism s |bipyramids|Bipyramid| , in which at least one of the equatorial quadrilaterals lies on a plane. The regular octahedron is a special case in which all three quadrilaterals are planar squares.    |Schönhardt_polyhedron|Schönhardt_Polyhedron| , a non-convex polyhedron that cannot be partitioned into tetrahedra without introducing new vertices.    |Bricard_octahedron|Bricard_Octahedron| , a non-convex self-crossing  |flexible_polyhedron|Flexible_Polyhedron|        More generally, an octahedron can be any polyhedron with eight faces. The regular octahedron has 6 vertices and 12 edges, the minimum for an octahedron; irregular octahedra may have as many as 12 vertices and 18 edges.    There are 257 topologically distinct convex octahedra, excluding mirror images. More specifically there are 2, 11, 42, 74, 76, 38, 14 for octahedra with 6 to 12 vertices respectively.       Some better known irregular octahedra include the following:    |Hexagonal_prism|Hexagonal_Prism| |pyramid|Pyramid| |Truncated_tetrahedron|Truncated_Tetrahedron| |Tetragonal_trapezohedron|Tetragonal_Trapezohedron| |kites|Kite| .             |diamond|Diamond| ,  |alum|Alum|  or  |fluorite|Fluorite|  are commonly octahedral, as the space-filling  |tetrahedral-octahedral_honeycomb|Tetrahedral-Octahedral_Honeycomb| .   The plates of  |kamacite|Kamacite|  alloy in  |octahedrite|Octahedrite| |meteorites|Meteorites|  are arranged paralleling the eight faces of an octahedron.   Many metal ions  |coordinate|Coordination_Chemistry|  six ligands in an octahedral or  |distorted|Jahn-Teller_Effect|  octahedral configuration.    |Widmanstätten_patterns|Widmanstätten_Pattern|  in  |nickel|Nickel| - |iron|Iron| |crystals|Crystal| |roleplaying_games|Roleplaying_Game| , this solid is known as a d8 , one of the more common  |polyhedral_dice|Dicepolyhedral_Dice| .   If each edge of an octahedron is replaced by a one- |ohm|Ohm| |resistor|Resistor| , the resistance between opposite vertices is  ohm, and that between adjacent vertices  ohm.    Six musical notes can be arranged on the vertices of an octahedron in such a way that each edge represents a consonant dyad and each face represents a consonant triad; see  |hexany|Hexany| .       A framework of repeating tetrahedrons and octahedrons was invented by  |Buckminster_Fuller|Buckminster_Fuller|  in the 1950s, known as a  |space_frame|Space_Frame| , commonly regarded as the strongest structure for resisting  |cantilever|Cantilever|  stresses.       A regular octahedron can be augmented into a  |tetrahedron|Tetrahedron|  by adding 4 tetrahedra on alternated faces. Adding tetrahedra to all 8 faces creates the  |stellated_octahedron|Stellated_Octahedron| .        The octahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube.          It is also one of the simplest examples of a  |hypersimplex|Hypersimplex| , a polytope formed by certain intersections of a  |hypercube|Hypercube|  with a  |hyperplane|Hyperplane| .     The octahedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra with  |Schläfli_symbols|Schläfli_Symbol|  , continuing into the  |hyperbolic_plane|Hyperbolic_Space| .            The regular octahedron can also be considered a  rectified tetrahedron – and can be called a tetratetrahedron. This can be shown by a 2-color face model. With this coloring, the octahedron has  |tetrahedral_symmetry|Tetrahedral_Symmetry| .     Compare this truncation sequence between a tetrahedron and its dual:        The above shapes may also be realized as slices orthogonal to the long diagonal of a  |tesseract|Tesseract| . If this diagonal is oriented vertically with a height of 1, then the first five slices above occur at heights r, , , , and s, where r is any number in the range .
