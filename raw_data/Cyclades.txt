        The Cyclades  are an  |island_group|Island_Group|  in the  |Aegean_Sea|Aegean_Sea| , southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative  |prefecture|Prefectures_Of_Greece|  of Greece. They are one of the  |island_groups|List_Of_Islands_Of_Greece|  which constitute the Aegean  |archipelago|Archipelago| . The name refers to the islands around the sacred island of  |Delos|Delos| . The largest island of the Cyclades is  |Naxos|Naxos| .               The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age  |Cycladic_culture|Cycladic_Culture|  is best known for its schematic, flat sculptures carved out of the islands pure white marble centuries before the great Middle  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age| |Minoan_civilization|Minoan_Civilization|  arose in Crete to the south.     A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on  |emmer|Emmer|  and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats . Excavated sites include  |Chalandriani|Chalandriani| ,  |Phylakopi|Phylakopi| ,  |Skarkos|Skarkos| ,  |Saliagos|Saliagos|  and Kephala  with signs of copperworking, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities , and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of  |Christianity|Christianity| .            The first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the  |British_School_at_Athens|British_School_At_Athens|  and by  |Christos_Tsountas|Christos_Tsountas| , who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898–1899 and coined the term Cycladic civilization . Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by  |Jean_Arp|Jean_Arp|  or  |Constantin_Brâncuși|Constantin_Brâncuși| . Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these  |Cycladic_figurines|Cycladic_Art|  has been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood.     Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic  |frying_pans|Frying_Pans| . More accurate  |archaeology|Archaeology|  has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from  |Anatolia|Anatolia|  c. 5000 BCE. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.  3300 – 2000 BCE, when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is known as the  |Helladic_period|Helladic_Period| .     In recent decades the Cyclades have become popular with European and other  |tourists|Tourism| , and as a result there have been problems with  |erosion|Erosion| ,  |pollution|Pollution| , and water shortages.                                 The Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being  |Amorgos|Amorgos| ,  |Anafi|Anafi| ,  |Andros|Andros| ,  |Antiparos|Antiparos| ,  |Delos|Delos| ,  |Ios|Ios| ,  |Kea|Kea| ,  |Kimolos|Kimolos| ,  |Kythnos|Kythnos| ,  |Milos|Milos| ,  |Mykonos|Mykonos| ,  |Naxos|Naxos| ,  |Paros|Paros| ,  |Folegandros|Folegandros| ,  |Serifos|Serifos| ,  |Sifnos|Sifnos| ,  |Sikinos|Sikinos| ,  |Syros|Syros| ,  |Tinos|Tinos| , and  |Thira_or_Santoríni|Santorini| . There are also many minor islands including  |Donousa|Donousa| ,  |Eschati|Eschati| ,  |Gyaros|Gyaros| ,  |Irakleia|Irakleia| ,  |Koufonisia|Koufonisia| ,  |Makronisos|Makronisos| ,  |Rineia|Rineia| , and  |Schoinousa|Schoinousa| . The name Cyclades refers to the islands forming a circle around the sacred island of Delos. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.      |Ermoupoli|Ermoupoli|  on Syros is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.     The islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two  |volcanic_islands|Volcano| , Milos and Santorini. The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes  |wine|Wine| ,  |fruit|Fruit| ,  |wheat|Wheat| ,  |olive_oil|Olive_Oil| , and  |tobacco|Tobacco| . Lower temperatures are registered in higher elevations and these areas do not usually see wintry weather.     The Cyclades are bounded to the south by the  |Sea_of_Crete|Sea_Of_Crete| . Saundry, Hogan & Baum. 2011         The Cyclades Prefecture  was one of the  |prefectures_of_Greece|Prefectures_Of_Greece| . As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine  |regional_units|Regional_Units_Of_Greece|  of the  |South_Aegean|South_Aegean|  region:    |Andros|Andros| |Kea-Kythnos|Kea-Kythnos| |Milos|Milos| |Mykonos|Mykonos| |Naxos|Naxos| |Paros|Paros| |Thira|Thira| |Syros|Syros| |Tinos|Tinos|          The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.       |Amorgos|Amorgos| |Andros|Andros| |Kea|Kea| |Milos|Milos| |Naxos|Naxos| |Paros|Paros| |Syros|Syros| |Tinos|Tinos| |Thira|Thira| Note: Provinces no longer hold any legal status in  |Greece|Greece| .
