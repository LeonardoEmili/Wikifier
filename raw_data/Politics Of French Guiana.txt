|_French_Guiana|French_Guiana|  is not a separate territory but is both an overseas  |région|Region_Of_France|  and overseas  |department|Departments_Of_France|  of  |France|France| , with the same government institutions as areas on the French mainland. The administrative center is  |Cayenne|Cayenne| .     The President of France appoints a  |prefect|Prefect|   as his representative to head the local government of French Guiana. There are two local executive bodies: the 19‑member general council and the 34‑member regional council, both elected. The Assembly of French Guiana replaced the  |General_Council|General_Council_Of_French_Guiana|  and the  |Regional_Council|Regional_Council_Of_French_Guiana|  in 2016.     In 2014 the  |prefect|Prefect|  is  |Éric_Spitz|Éric_Spitz| . The President of the general council is  |Alain_Tien_Liong|Alain_Tien_Liong|  and the President of the Regional Council is  |Rodolphe_Alexandre|Rodolphe_Alexandre| .       Politics in French Guiana are dominated by the  |Guianese_Socialist_Party|Guianese_Socialist_Party| , which has a close association with the  |Socialist_Party|Socialist_Party|  in mainland France.     A chronic issue affecting French Guiana is the influx of illegal immigrants and clandestine  |gold_prospectors|Gold_Prospecting|  from  |Brazil|Brazil|  and  |Suriname|Suriname| . The border between the department and  |Suriname|Suriname|  is formed by the  |Maroni_River|Maroni_River| , which flows through rain forest and is difficult for the  |Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie_Nationale|  and the  |French_Foreign_Legion|French_Foreign_Legion|  to patrol.     There have been several phases launched by the French government to combat illegal gold mining in French Guiana, beginning with Operation Anaconda beginning in 2003, followed by Operation Harpie in 2008, 2009 and Operation Harpie Reinforce in 2010. Colonel François Müller, the commander of French Guianas gendarme, believes these operations have been successful. However, after each operation ends, Brazilian miners,  |garimpeiros|Garimpeiros| , return.  Soon after Operation Harpie Reinforce began, an altercation took place between French authorities and Brazilian miners. On March 12, 2010, a team of French soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation, during which the soldiers had arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold... currently worth about $22,317 . Garimpeiros returned to retrieve the lost loot and colleagues. The soldiers fired warning shots and rubber flash balls but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500  grammes of gold. The violent reaction by the garimpeiros can be explained by the exceptional take of 617 grammes of gold, about 20 percent of the quantity seized in 2009 during the battle against illegal mining , said Phillipe Duporge, the director of French Guianas border police, at a press conference the next day.
