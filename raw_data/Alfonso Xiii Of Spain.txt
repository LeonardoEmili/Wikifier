     Alfonso XIII , also known as El Africano or the African, was  |King_of_Spain|King_Of_Spain|  from 1886 until the proclamation of the  |Second_Republic|Second_Republic_Of_Spain|  in 1931. Alfonso was monarch from birth as his father,  |Alfonso_XII|Alfonso_Xii| , had died the previous year. Alfonsos mother,  |Maria_Christina_of_Austria|Maria_Christina_Of_Austria| , served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.     During Alfonsos reign Spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups; the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants; problems arising from the  |Rif_War|Rif_War| ; and  |Catalan_nationalism|Catalan_Nationalism| . This political and social turbulence that began with the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War|  prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true  |liberal_democracy|Liberal_Democracy| , which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of  |Miguel_Primo_de_Rivera|Miguel_Primo_De_Rivera| . With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime. Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the kings support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera.     He left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, which were taken as a plebiscite on abolishing the monarchy.                  Alfonso was born in  |Madrid|Madrid|  on 17 May 1886. He was the posthumous son of  |Alfonso_XII_of_Spain|Alfonso_Xii_Of_Spain| , who had died in November 1885, and became King of Spain upon his birth. Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the Spanish prime minister on a silver tray.     Five days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a golden fleece round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the River Jordan in Palestine. Magnificent Monarchs p.21 by  |Ian_Locke|Ian_Locke| ; published by  |Macmillan|Macmillan_Publishers|  in 1999;  The French newspaper  Le Figaro  described the young king in 1889 as the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth . The Happiest Living Monarch , New York Times. 14 August 1889. His mother,  |Maria_Christina_of_Austria|Maria_Christina_Of_Austria| , served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over  |Cuba|Cuba| ,  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico| ,  |Guam|Guam|  and the  |Philippines|Philippines|  to the United States as a result of the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War| .     When he came of age in May 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain.  New York Times, 29 March 1902. He took his oath to the constitution before members of the Cortes on 17 May.           By 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland| , he stayed at  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace|  with King  |Edward_VII|Edward_Vii| . There he met Princess  |Victoria_Eugenie_of_Battenberg|Victoria_Eugenie_Of_Battenberg| , the daughter of Edwards youngest sister  |Princess_Beatrice|Princess_Beatrice_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , and a granddaughter of  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria| . He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a  |Protestant|Protestantism| , and would have to become a Catholic. Victorias brother Leopold was a  |haemophilia|Haemophilia| c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonsos mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the  |House_of_Habsburg-Lorraine|House_Of_Habsburg-Lorraine| , or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.     Victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in  |Biarritz|Biarritz| ,  |France|France| , later that month, and converted to Catholicism in  |San_Sebastián|San_Sebastián|  in March.        In May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the  |Royal_Monastery_of_San_Jerónimo|San_Jerónimo_El_Real|  in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victorias cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales . The wedding was marked by  |an_assassination_attempt|Morral_Affair|  on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan  |anarchist|Anarchist|  Mateu Morral. As the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured many bystanders and members of the procession.      On 10 May 1907, the couples first child,  |Alfonso,_Prince_of_Asturias|Alfonso,_Prince_Of_Asturias| , was born. However, Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition.     Neither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons,  |Gonzalo|Gonzalo_Of_Spain|  , had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his wife for transmitting the condition to their sons.      From 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children. A sixth illegitimate child had been born before his marriage.               During  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, Spain remained neutral. his wife was British, his mother Austrian, amongst other family relationships. The King established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides. This office used the Spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of POWs – transmitting and receiving letters for them, and other services.  The office was located in the  |Royal_Palace|Palacio_Real| .     Alfonso became gravely ill during the  |1918_flu_pandemic|1918_Flu_Pandemic| . Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed. This gave the misleading impression that Spain was the most-affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed the Spanish Flu. Barry 171.              Following World War I, Spain entered the lengthy yet victorious  |Rif_War|Rif_War|  to preserve its colonial rule over northern Morocco. Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso el Africano .  Alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch, and supported the  |Africanists|Africanist|  who wanted to conquer for Spain a new empire in Africa to compensate for the lost empire in the Americas and Asia. Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 274 The Rif War had starkly polarized Spanish society between the  |Africanists|Africanist|  who wanted to conquer an empire in Africa vs. the abandonistas who wanted to abandon Morocco as not worth the blood and treasure. Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 286. Alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals, and one of his most favored generals was  |Manuel_Fernández_Silvestre|Manuel_Fernández_Silvestre| . Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 276 In 1921, when Silvestre advanced up into the  |Rif_mountains|Rif|  of Morocco, Alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read Hurrah for real men! , urging Silvestre not to retreat at a time when Silvestre was experiencing major difficulties. Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 280. Silvestre stayed the course, leading his men into the  |Battle_of_Annual|Battle_Of_Annual| , one of Spains worst defeats. Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the Disaster of the Annual while he was playing golf. Reportedly, Alfonsos response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say Chicken meat is cheap , before resuming his game of golf. Perry, James Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 284. Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the Disaster of the Annual , which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King couldnt care less about the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the Cortes started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestres advance into the Rif mountains.     After the Disaster of the Annual , Spains war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging onto Morocco, support for the abandonistas grew as many people could see no point to the war. In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in  |Malaga|Malaga|  simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the Rif Republic was waved about. With the  |Africanists|Africanist|  comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the abandonistas forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the  |military_coup_détat_later_in_1923|Miguelprimoderiveramilitaryestablishesdictatorship| . On September 13, 1923, General  |Miguel_Primo_de_Rivera|Miguel_Primo_De_Rivera,_2Nd_Marquis_Of_Estella| , seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonsos support until 1930. It is believed that one of Alfonsos main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning Cortes report into the Annual disaster. The poetic  |Generation_of_27|Generation_Of_27|  as well as Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era.       In January 1930, due to economic problems and general unpopularity, Miguel Primo de Rivera resigned as Prime Minister. Alfonso, as the Prime Ministers ally, shared the popular dislike. The King had so closely associated with the  |Primo_de_Rivera|Primo_De_Rivera|  dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost seven years. In April 1931,  |General|General| |José_Sanjurjo|José_Sanjurjo|  told him even the army was not loyal. On 12 April, the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections. The municipal elections were fought as a virtual referendum on the future of the monarchy. Alfonso left the country on 14 April as the  |Second_Spanish_Republic|Second_Spanish_Republic|  was proclaimed, but did not formally abdicate. He eventually settled in Rome.     By a law of 26 November 1931, Alfonso was accused by the Cortes of high treason. See:  Gaceta de Madrid no. 332, 28/11/1931, p. 1250 This law would later be repealed by a new law dated 15 December 1938, signed by  |Francisco_Franco|Francisco_Franco| . See:  Boletín Oficial del Estado no. 173, 20/12/1938, p. 3039.       In 1933, his two eldest sons, Alfonso and Jaime, renounced their claims to the defunct throne, and in 1934 his youngest son Gonzalo died. This left his third son  |Juan,_Count_of_Barcelona|Juan,_Count_Of_Barcelona|  his only male heir. Juan later was the father of  |Juan_Carlos_I|Juan_Carlos_I_Of_Spain| .       When the Army rose up against the democratically elected Republican Government Paul Preston, History of the Spanish Civil War and war broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favoured the Nationalist military rebels against the Republic. But in September 1936 the Nationalist leader, General  |Francisco_Franco|Francisco_Franco| , declared that the Nationalists would not restore Alfonso as king.  Nevertheless, Alfonso sent his son Juan to Spain in 1936, to participate in the uprising. However, General  |Mola|Emilio_Mola|  had Juan arrested near the French border and expelled from the country.     On 29 September 1936, upon the death of  |Infante_Alfonso_Carlos,_Duke_of_San_Jaime|Infante_Alfonso_Carlos,_Duke_Of_San_Jaime|  , Alfonso also became the senior heir of  |Hugh_Capet|Hugh_Capet|  and so was hailed by some French  |legitimists|Legitimists|  as King Alphonse I of France and Navarre.       On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII abdicated his rights to the defunct Spanish throne in favour of Juan. He died in Rome on 28 February of that year.     In Spain, the  caudillo  Franco ordered three days of national mourning. Mourning in Spain , The Times : 3.

Alfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxurious  |Hotel_Palace|Hotel_Palace|  in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges  in historic buildings of Spain. His fondness for the sport of  |football|Association_Football|  led to the patronage of several Royal football clubs, the first being  |Real_Club_Deportivo_de_La_Coruña|Real_Club_Deportivo_De_La_Coruña|  in 1907.  Selected others include  |Real_Madrid|Real_Madrid_C.F.| ,  |Real_Sociedad|Real_Sociedad| ,  |Real_Betis|Real_Betis| ,  |Real_Unión|Real_Unión| ,  |Espanyol|Rcd_Espanyol|  and  |Real_Zaragoza|Real_Zaragoza| .     An avenue in the northern Madrid neighbourhood of Chamartín, Avenida de Alfonso XIII, is named after him. A plaza or town center in  |Iloilo_City|Iloilo_City| ,  |Philippines|Philippines|  was named in his honour called Plaza Alfonso XIII.  A street in  |Merthyr_Tydfil|Merthyr_Tydfil| , in  |Wales|Wales| , was built especially to house Spanish immigrants in the mining industry and named Alphonso Street after Alfonso XIII.      Alfonso XIII appears as King Buby in  |Luis_Colomas|Luis_Coloma|  story of  |Ratoncito_Pérez|Ratoncito_Pérez|  , which was written for the King when he was 8 years old. The story of Ratoncito Pérez has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then, with the character of Alfonso XIII appearing in some. Alfonso XIII is also mentioned on the plaque to Ratoncito Pérez on the second floor of  |la_calle_del_Arenal|La_Calle_Del_Arenal|  .
