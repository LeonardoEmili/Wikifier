                 Marmite  is a British  |food_spread|Spread|  made from  |yeast_extract|Yeast_Extract| , a  |by-product|By-Product|  of  |beer_brewing|Brewing| . Marmite is produced by  |Unilever|Unilever| . Other similar products include the Australian  |Vegemite|Vegemite|  , the Swiss  |Cenovis|Cenovis| , and the German  |Vitam-R|Vitam-R| . A similar spread, also named  |Marmite|Marmite|  , has been manufactured in New Zealand since 1919. That product is the only one sold as Marmite in  |Australasia|Australasia|  and the Pacific, whereas elsewhere in the world the British version predominates. The product is notable as a  |vegan_source|Vegan_Food|  of  |B_vitamins|B_Vitamins| , including supplemental  |Vitamin_B_12|Vitamin_B12| .     Marmite is a sticky, dark brown  |food_paste|Paste|  with a distinctive, powerful flavour, that is extremely salty. This distinctive taste is represented in the marketing slogan: Love it or hate it. Such is its prominence in  |British_popular_culture|British_Popular_Culture|  that the products name is often used as a metaphor for something that is an  |acquired_taste|Acquired_Taste|  or tends to polarise opinions.   Marmite is a commonly used ingredient in dishes as a flavoring, as it is particularly rich in  |umami|Umami|  due to its very high levels of  |glutamate|Glutamate|  .      The image on the front of the jar shows a  |marmite|Marmite|  , a French term for a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot. Marmite was originally supplied in  |earthenware|Earthenware|  pots but since the 1920s has been sold in glass cases.       The product that was to become Marmite was invented during the late 19th century when German scientist  |Justus_von_Liebig|Justus_Von_Liebig|  discovered that brewers yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten.   During 1902, the Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in  |Burton_upon_Trent|Burton_Upon_Trent| , Staffordshire, England with Marmite as its main product and Burton as the site of the first factory.  The by-product yeast needed for the paste was supplied by  |Bass_Brewery|Bass_Brewery| . By 1907, the product had become successful enough to warrant construction of a second factory at  |Camberwell_Green|Camberwell_Green|  in London.      By 1912, the discovery of  |vitamins|Vitamins|  was a boost for Marmite, as the spread is a rich source of the  |vitamin_B_complex|Vitamin_B_Complex| ;   with the  |vitamin_B_1|Thiamine|  deficiency  |beri-beri|Beri-Beri|  being common during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| , the spread became more popular.  British troops during World War I were issued Marmite as part of their  |rations|Field_Ration| .     During the 1930s, Marmite was used by the English scientist  |Lucy_Wills|Lucy_Wills|  to successfully treat a form of  |anaemia|Anaemia|  in mill workers in Bombay. She later identified  |folic_acid|Folic_Acid|  as the active ingredient.  Marmite was used to treat malnutrition by  |Suriya-Mal|Suriya-Mal_Movement|  workers during the 1934â€“5  |malaria|Malaria|  epidemic in  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka| .  Housewives were encouraged to spread Marmite thinly and to use it sparingly just now because of limited rations of the product.     During 1990, Marmite Limited, which had become a subsidiary of  |Bovril|Bovril|  Limited, was bought by  |CPC_International_Inc|Hellmanns_And_Best_Foods| , which changed its name to  |Best_Foods_Inc|Hellmanns_And_Best_Foods|  during 1998. Best Foods Inc subsequently merged with Unilever during 2000, and Marmite is now a trademark owned by Unilever.  .       There are a number of similar yeast products available in other countries; these products are not directly connected to the original Marmite recipe and brand. The Australian product  |Vegemite|Vegemite|  is distributed in many countries, and  |AussieMite|Aussiemite|  is sold in Australia. Other products include OzeMite, which is made by  |Dick_Smith_Foods|Dick_Smith_Foods| ;  |Cenovis|Cenovis| , a Swiss spread; and Vegex, an  |autolyzed|Autolyzed|  yeast product available in the United States since 1913.        Marmite is traditionally eaten as a  |savoury|Umami|  spread on bread,  |toast|Toast| , savoury biscuits or  |crackers|Cracker| , and other similar baked products. Owing to its concentrated taste it is often spread thinly with butter or margarine.  Marmite can also be made into a savoury hot drink by adding one teaspoon to a mug of hot water, much like  |Oxo|Oxo|  and  |Bovril|Bovril| . Marmite is also commonly used to richen  |casseroles|Casserole|  and  |stews|Stew| .     Marmite is paired with cheese, such as in a  |cheese_sandwich|Cheese_Sandwich| , and has been used as an additional flavouring in  |Mini_Cheddars|Mini_Cheddars| , a cheese-flavoured biscuit snack. Similarly, it is one of  |Walkers_Crisps|Walkers|  flavours; is sold as a flavouring on rice cakes; and Marmite Biscuits.  |Starbucks|Starbucks|  in the UK has a cheese and Marmite  |panini|Panino|  on its menu.      Marmite has been used as an ingredient in cocktails, including the Marmite Cocktail and the Marmite Gold Rush.            While the process is secret, the general method for making yeast extract on a commercial scale is to add salt to a suspension of yeast, making the solution  |hypertonic|Hypertonicity| , which results in the cells shrivelling; this triggers  |autolysis|Autolysis| , during which the yeast self-destructs. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, and since yeast cells have thick cell walls which would detract from the smoothness of the end product, the husks are sieved out. As with other yeast extracts, Marmite contains free  |glutamic_acids|Glutamic_Acid| , which are analogous to  |monosodium_glutamate|Monosodium_Glutamate| .     Presently, the main ingredients of Marmite are glutamic acid-rich yeast extract, with lesser quantities of  |salt|Sodium_Chloride| , vegetable extract, spice extracts and celery extracts, although the precise composition is a  |trade_secret|Trade_Secret| .  Some sources suggest that  |Vitamin_B_12|Vitamin_B12|  is not naturally found in yeast extract, and is only present because it is added to Marmite during manufacture.  Others indicate that Brewers and nutritional yeast extracts are also a rich source of B vitamins, particularly B-1, B-2, B-3, B-6, B-12, and folic acid.        Marmite is rich in B vitamins including  |thiamin|Thiamin|  ,  |riboflavin|Riboflavin|  ,  |niacin|Niacin|  ,  |folic_acid|Folic_Acid|  and vitamin B 12 . The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount per serving rather than the percentage in bulk Marmite that is relevant. The main ingredient of Marmite is yeast extract, which contains a high concentration of glutamic acid. Marmite is not gluten free, as it is made with wheat, and although it is thoroughly washed, it may contain small quantities of gluten.      Marmite should be avoided if a person takes a  |MAOI|Monoamine_Oxidase_Inhibitor|  antidepressant, such as  |phenelzine|Phenelzine|  or  |tranylcypromine|Tranylcypromine|  , as yeast extracts interact adversely with these types of medications due to their  |tyramine|Tyramine|  content.      Marmite is presently fortified with added vitamins, resulting in it being banned temporarily in Denmark, which disallows foodstuffs that have been fortified until they have been tested.  The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated during 2015 that Marmite had not been banned in the country, but that fortified foods need to be tested for safety and approved before they can be marketed in the country.  During 2014, suppliers applied for a risk assessment to be performed after which Marmite became available in Denmark.
