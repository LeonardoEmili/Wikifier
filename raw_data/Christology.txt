Christology from within and ahead by Mark L. Y. Chan 2001  pp. 59–62      Several approaches can be distinguished within Christology. The term Christology from above  or high Christology  refers to approaches that include aspects of divinity, such as Lord and Son of God, and the idea of the  |pre_existence_of_Christ|Pre_Existence_Of_Christ|  as the  Logos  , as expressed in the  |prologue_to_the_Gospel_of_John|Wikisource_Bible_John1| . These approaches interpret the works of Christ in terms of his divinity. According to Pannenberg, Christology from above was far more common in the ancient Church, beginning with  |Ignatius_of_Antioch|Ignatius_Of_Antioch|  and the second century Apologists.  The term Christology from below  or low Christology  refers to approaches that begin with the human aspects and the ministry of Jesus and move towards his divinity and the mystery of incarnation.               A basic Christological teaching is that the person of  |Jesus_Christ|Christ|  is both human and divine. The human and divine natures of Jesus Christ apparently  form a duality, as they coexist within one person . Introducing Christian Doctrine by Millard J. Erickson, L. Arnold Hustad 2001 ISBN p. 234 There are no direct discussions in the  |New_Testament|New_Testament|  regarding the  |dual_nature|Hypostatic_Union|  of the Person of Christ as both divine and human, and since the early days of Christianity, theologians have debated various approaches to the understanding of these natures, at times resulting in ecumenical councils, and schisms.     Some historical christological doctrines gained broad support.

Instead of considering sin as an affront to Gods honour, it sees sin as the breaking of Gods moral law.

Amazon, Kindle              The earliest Christological reflections were shaped by both the Jewish background of the earliest Christians, and by the Greek world of the eastern Mediterranean in which they operated.  The earliest Christian writings give several titles to Jesus, such as  |Son_of_Man|Son_Of_Man| ,  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_God| ,  |Messiah|Messiah| , and  |Kyrios|Kyrios| , which were all derived from the Hebrew scriptures.  According to Matt Stefon and Hans J. Hillerbrand,        Historically in the  |Alexandrian_school|Alexandrian_School|  of thought , Jesus Christ is the  |eternal_Logos|Logos|  who already possesses unity with the Father before the act of  |Incarnation|Incarnation| . Karl Barths christology by Charles T. Waldrop 1985  pp. 19–23 In contrast, the  |Antiochian_school|Antiochian_School|  viewed Christ as a single, unified human person apart from his relationship to the divine.        The notion of pre-existence is deeply rooted in Jewish thought, and can be found in apocalyptic thought and among the rabbis of Pauls time, but Paul was most influenced by Jewish-Hellenistic wisdom literature, where Wisdom is extolled as something existing before the world and already working in creation. According to Witherington, Paul subscribed to the christological notion that Christ existed prior to taking on human flesh founding the story of Christ on the story of divine Wisdom.        The title  |Kyrios|Kyrios|  for Jesus is central to the development of  |New_Testament|New_Testament|  Christology. It is the Greek translation of  |Aramaic|Aramaic|  Mari, which in everyday Aramaic usage was a very respectful form of polite address, which means more than just Teacher and was somewhat similar to  |Rabbi|Rabbi| . While the term Mari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, the Greek Kyrios came to represent his lordship over the world. The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959  p. 202      The  |early_Christians|Early_Christianity|  placed Kyrios at the center of their understanding, and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries. Christology: Biblical And Historical by Mini S. Johnson, 2005  pp. 229–35  The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the Kyrios title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of Kyrios included the  |pre_existence_of_Christ|Pre_Existence_Of_Christ| , for they believed if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning. The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959  pp. 234–37             Two fundamentally different Christologies developed in the early Church, namely a low or  |adoptionist|Adoptionism|  Christology, and a high or incarnation Christology.  The chronology of the development of these early Christologies is a matter of debate within contemporary scholarship.     The low Christology or adoptionist Christology is the belief that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead,  thereby raising him to divine status.  According to the evolutionary model  c.q. evolutionary theories,  the Christological understanding of Christ developed over time, Bart Ehrman, How Jesus became God, Course Guide as witnessed in the Gospels, with the earliest Christians believing that Jesus was a human who was exalted, c.q.  |adopted|Adoptionism|  as Gods Son, when he was resurrected. Geza Vermez , The Resurrection, p.138-139 Later beliefs shifted the exaltation to his baptism, birth, and subsequently to the idea of his pre-existence, as witnessed in the Gospel of John. This evolutionary model was proposed by proponents of the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule, especially  |Wilhelm_Boussets|Wilhelm_Bousset|  influential Kyrios Christos . This evolutionary model was very influential, and the low Christology has long been regarded as the oldest Christology.      The other early Christology is high Christology, which is the view that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being who became a human, did the Father’s will on earth, and then was taken back up into heaven whence he had originally come,  and from where he  |appeared_on_earth|Christophany| . According to Bousset, this high Christology developed at the time of Pauls writing, under the influence of Gentile Christians, who brought their pagan Hellenistic traditions to the early Christian communities, introducing divine honours to Jesus. According to Casey and Dunn, this high Christology developed after the time of Paul, at the end of the first century CE when the Gospel according to John was written.     Since the 1970s, these late datings for the development of a high Christology have been contested, and a majority of scholars argue that this High Christology existed already before the writings of Paul.  According to the New Religionsgeschichtliche Schule,  Larry Hurtado ,  c.q. Early High Christology Club, which includes  |Martin_Hengel|Martin_Hengel| ,  |Larry_Hurtado|Larry_Hurtado| ,  |N_T_Wright|N_T_Wright| , and  |Richard_Bauckham|Richard_Bauckham| , this incarnation Christology or high Christology did not evolve over a longer time, but was a big bang of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul.   Some Early High Christology proponents scholars argue that this High Christology may go back to Jesus himself. Larry Hurtado,            The study of the various Christologies of the  |Apostolic_Age|Apostolic_Age|  is based on early Christian documents.          The oldest Christian sources are the writings of  |Paul|Paul_The_Apostle| . The central Christology of Paul conveys the notion of Christs pre-existence and the identification of Christ as  Kyrios . Both notions already existed before him in the early Christian communities, and Paul deepened them and used them for preaching in the Hellenistic communities.     The  |Pauline_epistles|Pauline_Epistles|  use Kyrios to identify Jesus almost 230 times, and express the theme that the true mark of a Christian is the confession of Jesus as the true Lord. Paul viewed the superiority of the Christian revelation over all other divine manifestations as a consequence of the fact that Christ is the  |Son_of_God|Son_Of_God| .     The Pauline epistles also advanced the  |cosmic_Christ|Cosmic_Christ| ology  later developed in the fourth gospel,  elaborating the cosmic implications of Jesus existence as the Son of God, as in Corinthians 5:17: Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. Also, in Colossians 1:15: He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.             The synoptic Gospels date from after the writings of Paul. They provide episodes from the life of Jesus and some of his works, but the authors of the New Testament show little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life, Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by  |Karl_Rahner|Karl_Rahner|  2004  p. 731 and as in  |John_21_25|Wikisource_Bible_John21_25| , the Gospels do not claim to be an exhaustive list of his works.     Christologies that can be gleaned from the three  |Synoptic_Gospels|Synoptic_Gospels|  generally emphasize the humanity of Jesus, his sayings, his  |parables|Parables_Of_Jesus| , and his  |miracles|Miracles_Of_Jesus| . The  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John|  provides a different perspective that focuses on his divinity. The first 14 verses of the Gospel of John are devoted to the divinity of Jesus as the  Logos , usually translated as Word , along with his pre-existence, and they emphasize the cosmic significance of Christ, e.g. John 1:3: All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In the context of these verses, the Word made flesh is identical with the Word who was in the beginning with God, being exegetically equated with Jesus.               Following the  |Apostolic_Age|Apostolic_Age| , from the second century onwards, a number of controversies developed about how the human and divine are related within the person of Jesus. As of the second century, a number of different and opposing approaches developed among various groups. In contrast to prevailing  |monoprosopic|Monoprosopic|  views on the Person of Christ, alternative  |dyoprosopic|Dyoprosopic|  notions were also promoted by some theologians, but such views were rejected by the  |ecumenical_councils|Ecumenical_Councils| . For example,  |Arianism|Arianism|  did not endorse divinity,  |Ebionism|Ebionism|  argued Jesus was an ordinary mortal, while  |Gnosticism|Gnosticism|  held  |docetic|Docetism|  views which argued Christ was a spiritual being who only appeared to have a physical body. The resulting tensions led to  |schisms|Schism|  within the church in the second and third centuries, and  |ecumenical_councils|Ecumenical_Councils|  were convened in the fourth and fifth centuries to deal with the issues.     Although some of the debates may seem to various modern students to be over a theological iota, they took place in controversial political circumstances, reflecting the relations of temporal powers and divine authority, and certainly resulted in schisms, among others that separated the  |Church_of_the_East|Church_Of_The_East|  from the Church of the Roman Empire.

The 431 council was called because in defense of his loyal priest Anastasius, Nestorius had denied the  Theotokos  title for  |Mary|Virgin_Mary|  and later contradicted  |Proclus|Proclus|  during a sermon in  |Constantinople|Constantinople| . Pope  |Celestine_I|Celestine_I|  wrote about this to  |Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria| , who orchestrated the council. During the council, Nestorius defended his position by arguing there must be two persons of Christ, one human, the other divine, and Mary had given birth only to a human, hence could not be called the Theotokos, i.e. the one who gives birth to God .

Jenson 2004  p. 84            The 451  |Council_of_Chalcedon|Council_Of_Chalcedon|  was highly influential, and marked a key turning point in the Christological debates. It is the last council which many  |Anglicans|Anglican|  and most  |Protestants|Protestants|  consider ecumenical.     The Council of Chalcedon fully promulgated the Western  |dyophysite|Dyophysitism|  understanding put forth by  |Pope_Leo_I|Pope_Leo_I|  of Rome of the  hypostatic union , the proposition that Christ has one human nature  physis  and one divine nature physis, each distinct and complete, and united with neither confusion nor division. Most of the major branches of Western Christianity  and  |Eastern_Orthodoxy|Eastern_Orthodoxy|  subscribe to the Chalcedonian Christological formulation, while many branches of  |Oriental_Orthodox_Churches|Oriental_Orthodox_Churches|   reject it.     Although the  |Chalcedonian_Creed|Chalcedonian_Creed|  did not put an end to all Christological debate, it did clarify the terms used and became a point of reference for many future Christologies. But it also broke apart the church of the  |Eastern_Roman_Empire|Eastern_Roman_Empire|  in the fifth century, and unquestionably established the primacy of Rome in the East over those who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. This was reaffirmed in 519, when the Eastern Chalcedonians accepted the  |Formula_of_Hormisdas|Pope_Hormisdas| , anathematizing all of their own Eastern Chalcedonian hierarchy, who died out of communion with Rome from 482-519.       The  |Second_Council_of_Constantinople|Second_Council_Of_Constantinople|  in 553 interpreted the decrees of Chalcedon, and further explained the relationship of the two natures of Jesus. It also condemned the alleged teachings of  |Origen|Origen|  on the pre-existence of the soul, and other topics.      The  |Third_Council_of_Constantinople|Third_Council_Of_Constantinople|  in 681 declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the  |Monothelites|Monothelites| ,  with the divine will having precedence, leading and guiding the human will. The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology by Alan Richardson and John Bowden  page 169     The  |Second_Council_of_Nicaea|Second_Council_Of_Nicaea|  was called under the Empress Regent  |Irene_of_Athens|Irene_Of_Athens|  in 787, known as the second of Nicaea.

Calvins Christology by Stephen Edmondson 2004  p. 217 Calvin also emphasized the importance of the Work of Christ in any attempt at understanding the Person of Christ and cautioned against ignoring the Works of Jesus during his ministry. Calvins First Catechism by I. John Hesselink 1997  p. 217              The 19th century saw the rise of Liberal Protestant theology, which questioned the dogmatic foundations of Christianity, and approached the Bible with critical-historical tools. Jaroslav Jan Pelikan,  The divinity of Jesus was problematized, and replaced with an emphasis on the ethical aspects of his teachings.        |Catholic|Catholic| |_theologian|Theologian| |_Karl_Rahner|Karl_Rahner|  sees the purpose of modern Christology as to formulate the Christian belief that God became man and that God-made-man is the individual Jesus Christ in a manner that this statement can be understood consistently, without the confusions of past debates and mythologies. Rahner pointed out the coincidence between the Person of Christ and the Word of God, referring to  |Mark_8_38|Wikisource_Bible_Mark8_38|  and  |Luke_9_26|Wikisource_Bible_Luke9_26|  which state whoever is ashamed of the words of Jesus is ashamed of the Lord himself. Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004  p. 1822      |Hans_von_Balthasar|Hans_Urs_Von_Balthasar|  argued the union of the human and divine natures of Christ was achieved not by the absorption of human attributes, but by their assumption .

Bauer 1999 p. 17 According to Ulrich Luz , the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages. The theology of the Gospel of Matthew by Ulrich Luz 1995 p. 31         The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provides a rich background for Christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the Pauline Epistles . Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 p. 106     A central element in the Christology presented in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan . New Testament christology by Frank J. Matera 1999 p. 67 In this view, as in Acts 2:23 , the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the lawless is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God. The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns by Marion L. Soards 1994 p. 34     Pauls Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term the cross of Christ used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels. Christology by Hans Schwarz 1998 pp 132–34 For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences, as in Cor 2:8. In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death , died at the right time based on the plan of God. For Paul, the power of the cross is not separable from the resurrection of Jesus.           The threefold office  of Jesus Christ is a Christian doctrine based upon the teachings of the Old Testament. It was described by Eusebius and more fully developed by John Calvin . It states that Jesus Christ performed three functions in his earthly ministry  – those of prophet , priest , and king . In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be indicated by anointing him or her by pouring oil over the head. Thus, the term messiah, meaning anointed one , is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently associated with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the Book of Hebrews .         Some Christians, notably Roman Catholics , view Mariology as a key component of Christology. Mariology Is Christology , in Vittorio Messori , The Mary Hypothesis, Rome: 2005. In this view, not only is Mariology a logical and necessary consequence of Christology, but without it, Christology is incomplete, since the figure of Mary contributes to a fuller understanding of who Christ is and what he did. Paul Haffner, 2004 The mystery of Mary Gracewing Press p. 17     Protestants have criticized Mariology because many of its assertions lack any biblical foundation. Walter A. Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Second Edition , 736. Strong Protestant reaction against Roman Catholic Marian devotion and teaching has been a significant issue for ecumenical dialogue. Erwin Fahlbusch et al., “Mariology,” The Encyclopedia of Christianity , 409.     Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger expressed this sentiment about Roman Catholic Mariology when in two separate occasions he stated, The appearance of a truly Marian awareness serves as the touchstone indicating whether or not the Christological substance is fully present Communio , 1996, Volume 23, p. 175 and It is necessary to go back to Mary, if we want to return to the truth about Jesus Christ.
