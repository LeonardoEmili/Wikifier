Copleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for debating the  |existence_of_God|Existence_Of_God|  with  |Bertrand_Russell|Bertrand_Russell|  in a celebrated 1948  |BBC|Bbc|  broadcast; the following year he debated  |logical_positivism|Logical_Positivism|  and the meaningfulness of  |religious_language|Sacred_Language|  with his friend the  |analytic_philosopher|Analytic_Philosophy| |A._J._Ayer|A._J._Ayer| .          Frederick Charles Copleston was born 10 April 1907 near  |Taunton|Taunton| , Somerset, England. He was raised in the  |Anglican|Anglican|  faith—his uncle,  |Reginald_Stephen_Copleston|Reginald_Stephen_Copleston| , was an  |Anglican_bishop_of_Calcutta|Anglican_Diocese_Of_Calcutta| ; another uncle,  |Ernest_Copleston|Ernest_Copleston| , was the  |Bishop_of_Colombo|Bishop_Of_Colombo| . Copleston was educated at  |Marlborough_College|Marlborough_College|  from 1920 to 1925. At the age of eighteen, he converted to the Roman Catholic faith, which caused great stress in his family. Despite his initial objections, his father helped him complete his education at  |St_Johns_College,_Oxford|St_Johns_College,_Oxford| , where he studied from 1925 to 1929. He graduated from  |Oxford_University|Oxford_University|  in 1929 having managed a third in classical moderations and a good second at  |Greats|Literae_Humaniores| .     In 1930, Copleston became a  |Jesuit|Jesuit| . After studying at the Jesuit novitiate in Roehampton for two years, he resettled at Heythrop, where in 1937 he was ordained a Jesuit priest at  |Heythrop_College|Heythrop_College,_University_Of_London| . In 1938 he travelled to Germany to complete his training, returning to Britain just before the outbreak of war in 1939. Copleston originally intended to study for his doctorate at the Gregorian University in Rome, but the war now made that impossible. Instead, he accepted an offer to return to Heythrop College to teach the history of philosophy to the few remaining Jesuits there.     While teaching at Heythrop College, Copleston began writing his influential multi-volume  A History of Philosophy  , a textbook that presents clear accounts of  |ancient|Ancient_Philosophy| , medieval, and modern philosophy. The original and  |DoubleDay|Doubleday|  editions of the History were published in 9 volumes. From 2003  |Continuum|Continuum_International_Publishing_Group|  added two other works by Copleston to the series to present it as a work of 11 volumes. Still highly respected, Coplestons history has been described as a monumental achievement that stays true to the authors it discusses, being very much a work in exposition .     Copleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for  |debating|Copleston–Russell_Debate|  the  |existence_of_God|Existence_Of_God|  with  |Bertrand_Russell|Bertrand_Russell|  in a celebrated 1948  |BBC|Bbc|  broadcast;  the following year he debated  |logical_positivism|Logical_Positivism|  and the meaningfulness of  |religious_language|Sacred_Language|  with his friend the  |analytic_philosopher|Analytic_Philosophy| |A._J._Ayer|A._J._Ayer| .     Throughout the rest of his academic career, Copleston accepted a number of prestigious titles, including Visiting Professor at  |Pontifical_Gregorian_University|Pontifical_Gregorian_University|  in Rome, where he spent six months each year lecturing from 1952 to 1968. In 1970, he was made Fellow of the  |British_Academy|British_Academy|  , and in 1972 he was given a personal professorship from Heythrop College, since re-established by the  |University_of_London|University_Of_London| . In 1975, he was made an Honorary Fellow of St. Johns College, Oxford.     After officially retiring in 1974, he continued to lecture. From 1974 to 1982, Copleston was Visiting Professor at the  |University_of_Santa_Clara|Santa_Clara_University| , and from 1979 to 1981, he delivered the  |Gifford_Lectures|Gifford_Lectures|  at the  |University_of_Aberdeen|University_Of_Aberdeen| , which were published as Religion and the One. These lectures were attempted to express themes perennial in his thinking and more personal than in his history . Toward the end of his life, Copleston received honorary doctorates from several institutions, including Santa Clara University, California,  |Uppsala_University|Uppsala_University| , and the  |University_of_St_Andrews|University_Of_St_Andrews| .     Copleston was offered memberships in the  |Royal_Institute_of_Philosophy|Royal_Institute_Of_Philosophy|  and in the  |Aristotelian_Society|Aristotelian_Society| . In 1993 he was made  |CBE|Order_Of_The_British_Empire| . Copleston died on 3 February 1994 at  |St_Thomas_Hospital|St_Thomas_Hospital|  in London, at the age of 86.          In addition to his influential multi-volume  History of Philosophy  , one of Coplestons most significant contributions to modern philosophy was his work on the theories of Saint  |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas| . He attempted to clarify Aquinass  |Five_Ways|Quinquae_Viae|   by making a distinction between  in fieri  causes and  in esse  causes. By doing so, Copleston makes clear that Aquinas wanted to put forth the concept of an omnipresent God rather than a being that could have disappeared after setting the chain of cause and effect into motion.        |A_History_of_Philosophy|A_History_Of_Philosophy|       Other select works Friedrich Nietzsche: Philosopher of Culture , expanded edition;   Arthur Schopenhauer: Philosopher of Pessimism    Medieval Philosophy  , revised edition:  A History of Medieval Philosophy      Aquinas       Contemporary Philosophy: Studies of Logical Positivism and Existentialism  , republished with a new first chapter in 1972 this 1972 edition was later  of the  |Continuum|Continuum_International_Publishing_Group|  edition of Coplestons  A History of Philosophy  from 2003   Religion and Philosophy    Philosophers and Philosophies   On the History of Philosophy and Other Essays Vater, Michael https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b0ff/3a4ff817e0ea15590075c8207dea824d6508.pdf Review of On the History of Philosophy and Other Essays by Frederick Copleston published version in:  The Review of Metaphysics , Vol. 36, No. 3 : 700-701   Philosophers and Culture   Religion and the One: Philosophies East and West     Philosophy in Russia: From Herzen to Lenin and Berdyaev  later  of the  |Continuum|Continuum_International_Publishing_Group|  edition of Coplestons  A History of Philosophy  from 2003   Russian Religious Philosophy   Memoirs of a Philosopher     for a more complete bibliography see  The Heythrop Journal . 28 .
