      Transportation in Puerto Rico  includes a system of roads, highways, freeways, airports, ports and harbors, and railway systems, serving a population of approximately 4 million year-round. It is funded primarily with both  |local|Government_Of_Puerto_Rico|  and  |federal|Federal_Government_Of_The_United_States|  government funds.          Puerto Rico has a total of 30 airports , including one in each of the smaller islands of  |Vieques|Vieques,_Puerto_Rico|  and  |Culebra|Culebra,_Puerto_Rico| . The main airport is  |Luis_Muñoz_Marín_International_Airport|Luis_Muñoz_Marín_International_Airport| , and consists of two runways and three concourses. It is by far the busiest airport in Puerto Rico, with direct connections to most major cities in the mainland United States, Latin America, Canada, the Caribbean  |Madrid|Madrid| , Spain, Germany.     Puerto Rico has 21 airports with paved runways, of which:   3 airports with more than  of runway.   3 airports with runways ranging between  and .   15 airports with less than  of runway.   Puerto Rico also has 8 airports with unpaved runways, all of which have less than  of runway.       The following are current and former passenger and cargo airlines based in Puerto Rico or with flights to Puerto Rico:        |Aerovías_Nacionales_de_Puerto_Rico|Aerovías_Nacionales_De_Puerto_Rico| |Prinair|Prinair| |Puertorriqueña_de_Aviación|Puertorriqueña_De_Aviación| |Pan_American_World_Airways|Pan_American_World_Airways| |Mexicana_de_Aviacion|Mexicana_De_Aviacion| |Lufthansa|Lufthansa| |Viasa|Viasa| |Aerolineas_Argentinas|Aerolineas_Argentinas| |KLM|Klm| |TWA|Twa| |Air_Caribbean|Air_Caribbean| |Air_Culebra|Air_Culebra| |Air_Flamenco|Air_Flamenco| |Dorado_Wings|Dorado_Wings| |Executive_Air|Executive_Air| |Fina_Air|Fina_Air| |Isla_Nena_Air|Isla_Nena_Air| |Oceanair|Oceanair| |Roblex_Aviation|Roblex_Aviation| |San_Juan_Aviation|San_Juan_Aviation| |Tol_Air|Tol_Air| |Vieques_Air_Link|Vieques_Air_Link| |American_Airlines|American_Airlines| |American_Eagle|American_Eagle_Airlines| |Delta_Air_Lines|Delta_Air_Lines| |Spirit_Airlines|Spirit_Airlines| |JetBlue|Jetblue| |AirTran_Airways|Airtran_Airways| |American_Trans_Air|American_Trans_Air| |United|United_Airlines| |Continental|Continental_Airlines| |Copa_Airlines|Copa_Airlines| |Insel_Air|Insel_Air| |Iberia_Airlines|Iberia_Airlines| |Virgin_Atlantic_Airlines|Virgin_Atlantic_Airlines| |US_Airways|Us_Airways| |PAWA_Dominicana|Pawa_Dominicana| |Southwest_Airlines|Southwest_Airlines| |Volaris|Volaris| |Norwegian_Air_Shuttle|Norwegian_Air_Shuttle| |Fed_Ex_Express|Fed_Ex_Express| |Cargolux|Cargolux| |CAL_Cargo_Airlines|Cal_Cargo_Airlines| |Martinair|Martinair|                   Sea-based transportation of any merchandise or persons shipped entirely or even partly by water between U.S. points—either directly or indirectly via one or any number of foreign points—U.S. Federal Law requires that said items or persons must travel in U.S.-built, U.S.-crewed, U.S.-citizen owned vessels that are U.S.-documented by the Coast Guard for such maritime  |cabotage|Cabotage|  carriage. This transportation/trade restriction includes Puerto Rico under the Jones Act of 1920 . The  |Jones_Act|Merchant_Marine_Act_Of_1920|  and various other United States laws that govern the domestic and domestic-foreign-domestic transportation of merchandise and passengers by water between two points in the United States, including Puerto Rico, have been extended to that island-territory since the initial years of United States political relations. Currently, the only providers who ship from the United States to Puerto Rico are  |Crowley_Maritime|Crowley_Maritime| ,  |TOTE_Maritime|Tote_Maritime| , and  |Trailer_Bridge|Trailer_Bridge| .     Strictly construed, the Jones Act refers only to Section 27 of the  |Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920|Merchant_Marine_Act_Of_1920| , , which has come to bear the name of its original sponsor, Sen.  |Wesley_L._Jones|Wesley_L._Jones| . Another law that was enacted in 1886 requires essentially the same standards for the transport of passengers between U.S. points, directly or indirectly transported through foreign ports or foreign points . However, since the mid-1980s, as part of a joint effort between the  |cruise_ship|Cruise_Ship|  industry that serves Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican politicians such as then  |Resident_Commissioner|Resident_Commissioner_Of_Puerto_Rico| , U.S. non-voting Representative  |Baltasar_Corrada_del_Río|Baltasar_Corrada_Del_Río| , obtained a limited-exception since no U.S. cruise ships that were Jones Act-eligible were participating in said market.     The application of these  |coastwise_shipping|Coastwise_Shipping|  laws and their imposition on Puerto Rico consist in a serious restriction of  |free_trade|Free_Trade|  and have been under scrutiny and controversy due to the apparent contradictory rhetoric involving the United States Governments sponsorship of free trade policies around the world, while its own national  |shipping|Shipping|  policy is essentially  |mercantilist|Mercantilist|  and based on notions foreign to free-trade principles.        San Juan Port  - Mainly divided in three: one in  |Old_San_Juan|Old_San_Juan|  which includes cargo/freight and cruise ships, the Pan American Port Terminal in Isla Grande section mostly for cruise ships, and Puerto Nuevo Bay, exclusively for freight/cargo ships the belong to Guaynabo City not to San Juan. It is the main port of the island.    Port of Ponce  - The second largest port in Puerto Rico and can handle both freight/cargo and cruise ships. It is currently undergoing a significant expansion , with plans to convert it to an international shipping hub.    Port of Mayagüez  - The third largest port in Puerto Rico. It is mainly used for freight/cargo ships but is also home to the  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic| -Puerto Rico passenger ferry and has also been used for cruise ships.       The following are minor ports and harbors used for small freight/cargo ships, fishing vessels, and private boats/yachts:  |Guánica|Guánica,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Guayanilla|Guayanilla,_Puerto_Rico| , Guayama, Fajardo,  |Culebra|Culebra,_Puerto_Rico| , and  |Vieques|Vieques,_Puerto_Rico| .     There are ferries between Ceiba-Culebra and Ceiba-Vieques; between  |San_Juan_and_Cataño|La_Lancha_De_Cataño| ; and between Ponce and  |Caja_de_Muertos|Caja_De_Muertos|  .     There are several private marinas in Puerto Rico for boats and yachts, the largest being Puerto del Rey in Fajardo and  |Club_Naútico_de_Ponce|Club_Naútico_De_Ponce| .            The  |Merchant_Marine_Act_of_1920|Merchant_Marine_Act_Of_1920|   prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports . Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from  |Central|Central_America|  and  |South_America|South_America| ,  |Western_Europe|Western_Europe| , and  |Africa|Africa|  cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors  |break_bulk|Break_Bulk_Cargo|  and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.     Puerto Rican consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods again across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea on U.S.-flagged ships subject to the extremely high operating costs imposed by the Jones Act. This also makes Puerto Rico less competitive with Caribbean ports as a shopping destination for tourists from home countries with much higher taxes even though prices for non-American manufactured goods in theory should be cheaper since Puerto Rico is much closer to Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa.     The  |local_government_of_Puerto_Rico|Government_Of_Puerto_Rico|  has requested several times to the  |U.S._Congress|U.S._Congress|  to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success. The most recent measure has been taken by the  |17th_Legislative_Assembly_of_Puerto_Rico|17Th_Legislative_Assembly_Of_Puerto_Rico|  through .   These measures have always received support from all the  |major_local_political_parties|Political_Party_Strength_In_Puerto_Rico| . In 2013 the  |Government_Accountability_Office|Government_Accountability_Office|  published a report which concluded that repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs and that shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs.  The report, however, concluded that the effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain for both Puerto Rico and the United States, particularly for the  |U.S._shipping_industry|United_States_Merchant_Marine|  and the military preparedness of the United States.         Tren Urbano  - Provides passenger train service between various points of the  |San_Juan_Metropolitan_Area|San_Juan_Metropolitan_Area| , between  |Bayamón|Bayamón,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Guaynabo|Guaynabo|  and several important sections of San Juan.    Port of Ponce Railroad  - The only  |industrial_railroad|Industrial_Railway|  operating on the entire island and located within the  |Puerto_de_Las_Américas|Puerto_De_Las_Américas|  in  |Ponce,_Puerto_Rico|Ponce,_Puerto_Rico| . It consists of a small  |railroad_yard|Rail_Yard|  and a railroad ferry terminal. About twice monthly, the  |railroad_ferry|Train_Ferry|  transports  |tanker_cars|Tank_Car|  on a  |barge|Car_Float|  between  |Mobile,_Alabama|Mobile,_Alabama|  and the Ponce rail terminal, delivering chemicals for Puerto Ricos pharmaceutical industry.   Chemex Railroad operation in Ponce.    Tourism Railroads  - Several locomotives are used for tourism and recreational services, such as  |El_Parque_del_Tren|El_Parque_Del_Tren|  in Bayamón  , RadioSabor.es and the historic narrow gauge old sugarcane plantation  |Tren_del_Sur|Tren_Del_Sur|  in  |Arroyo|Arroyo,_Puerto_Rico|  . Government of Puerto Rico              The Puerto Rico train system flourished during the late 19th and early 20th century due to a large  |sugar_cane|Sugar_Cane|  industry in the island. Most, if not all, of these system were private-owned services. Vieques Island also had the system all around the island connecting the others sugar cane plantations.     During the 1870s and 1890s, Puerto Rico did not have a national railroad system, but the city of Mayagüez did have a small passenger rail system for transporting its residents mainly along the Mendez Vigo Avenue.     The main system can be traced back to 1891, when the northern line was built between San Juan and the town of  |Manatí|Manatí| . The system was expanded to include all the western coastal towns, providing a link which would allow passengers to travel between the northern and southern parts of the island in less than a day for the first time in its history. Before its downfall, the Puerto Rico railroad system operated in all major cities, with tracks and stations along most of the coastal towns and direct lines to all major sugar refineries.     However, when Puerto Rico changed its mostly agricultural economy to an industrialized one, and the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments started investing heavily in interstate  |highways|Highway|  and  |freeways|Freeway| , the railroad business soon collapsed. Passenger travel ceased in 1953, while the commercial train system continued operating until 1957.             Puerto Rico has an extensive system of roads and  |highways|Highway|  featuring tolled freeways . Some are designated as  |Interstate_Highways|Interstate_Highways| ; although these routes do not connect to the  |contiguous_United_States|Contiguous_United_States| , and are unsigned as such, they still receive funding in a similar fashion to the other Interstates on the U.S. mainland. In total, there are more than 8,950 miles of paved road. Some of the major highways are:      PR-1  - Original main road between  |San_Juan|San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico|  and  |Ponce|Ponce,_Puerto_Rico|  before the completion of PR-52. It is now mostly used by people living nearby and as a scenic route.    PR-2  - Main  |freeway|Freeway| /highway/ |urban_primary_highway|Street|  between/through Ponce,  |Mayagüez|Mayagüez| ,  |Aguadilla|Aguadilla,_Puerto_Rico| , and  |Arecibo|Arecibo,_Puerto_Rico| . Original main highway between Arecibo and San Juan before completion of PR-22 . This is the longest road in Puerto Rico.    PR-3  -  Original main highway/urban primary highway between/through  |Salinas|Salinas,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Guayama|Guayama,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Humacao|Humacao,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Fajardo|Fajardo,_Puerto_Rico|  and San Juan .    PR-22  - Main freeway between San Juan and  |Hatillo|Hatillo,_Puerto_Rico|  .    PR-52   - Main freeway between San Juan and Ponce.    PR-10  - Main highway between Ponce and Arecibo .    PR-53  - Main freeway between Salinas, Guayama,  |Yabucoa|Yabucoa,_Puerto_Rico| , Humacao and Fajardo .    PR-66  - Main freeway between  |Canóvanas|Canovanas,_Puerto_Rico| ,  |Carolina|Carolina,_Puerto_Rico| , San Juan, and  |Río_Grande|Río_Grande,_Puerto_Rico| .          Transportation in Puerto Rico is heavily dependent on automobile transportation. Nevertheless, the government has increased investment in public transportation in an attempt to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion. The islands metro area is serviced with three major public transportation systems:     The 10.7 mile metro system called  |Tren_Urbano|Tren_Urbano|  with a total of 16 stations.  The project, which began operations in late 2004 cost a total of $2.25 billion and was more than $1 billion over budget and four years late. However, the subsidized Tren Urbano has received far less ridership than was originally projected and has failed to make a significant impact on reducing the islands metropolitan area traffic. , TOLLROADSNews, November 20, 2005, accessed April 13, 2007.   A daily ferry service known as the  |Cataño_Ferry|Cataño_Ferry| ,  which operates a route across  |San_Juan_Bay|San_Juan_Bay|  between Old San Juan and the municipality of  |Cataño|Cataño,_Puerto_Rico| .     |Metropolitan_Bus_Authority|Autoridad_Metropolitana_De_Autobuses|   provides daily bus transportation to residents of San Juan, Guaynabo, Bayamón, Trujillo Alto, Cataño, and Carolina through . Its fleet consists of 277 regular buses and 35 buses for handicapped persons, and its ridership is estimated at 112,000 on work days.        Most cities and towns also have a  |Jitney-type_taxi|Share_Taxi|  system locally called Carros Públicos. Each town has a central taxi terminal usually within walking distance of the towns central plaza where taxis are stationed, and they provide transportation through local and islandwide routes. In February 2014, the islandwide system of Carros Públicos consisted of over 3,000 vehicles authorized by the Comission de Servico Público , and it covered almost 500 routes. At approximately 130,000 passengers per day, in 2014 the Públicos system handled over five times the daily passenger volume of the islands largest international airport, the  |Luis_Muñoz_Marín|Luis_Muñoz_Marín_International_Airport| .
