           The Glagolitic script  is the oldest known  |Slavic|Old_Church_Slavonic| |alphabet|Alphabet| . It is generally agreed to have been created in the 9th century by  |Saint_Cyril|Saints_Cyril_And_Methodius| , a Byzantine monk from  |Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki| . He and his brother,  |Saint_Methodius|Saint_Methodius_Of_Thessaloniki| , were sent by the Byzantine Emperor  |Michael_III|Michael_Iii|  in 863 to  |Great_Moravia|Great_Moravia|  to spread Christianity among the  |West_Slavs|West_Slavs|  in the area. The brothers decided to translate liturgical books into the then current Slavic language understandable to the general population . As the words of that language could not be easily written by using either the Greek or Latin alphabets, Cyril decided to invent a new script, Glagolitic, which he based on the local dialect of the Slavic tribes from the Byzantine  |theme_of_Thessalonica|Thessalonica| .     After the deaths of Cyril and Methodius, the Glagolitic alphabet ceased to be used in Moravia, but their students continued to propagate it in the  |First_Bulgarian_Empire|First_Bulgarian_Empire| , where it was subsequently also displaced by the  |Cyrillic_alphabet|Cyrillic_Script|  developed at the  |Preslav_Literary_School|Preslav_Literary_School| . The Glagolitic alphabet was preserved only by the clergy of  |Croatia|Croatia|  to write  |Church_Slavonic|Church_Slavonic|  until the early 19th century.       The name was not created until many centuries after the scripts creation, and comes from the  |Old_Church_Slavonic|Old_Church_Slavonic| |глаголъ|Wikt:Глаголъ|  glagol utterance . The verb glagolati means to speak . It has been conjectured that the name glagolitsa developed in  |Croatia|Croatia|  around the 14th century and was derived from the word glagolity, applied to adherents of the liturgy in Slavonic. Bernard Comrie and Greville G. Corbett, The Slavonic Languages, Taylor & Francis, 2002, p. 29.                                       The creation of the characters is popularly attributed to  |Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius|Saints_Cyril_And_Methodius| , who may have created them to facilitate the introduction of Christianity. Alan Timberlake, A Reference Grammar of Russian, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 14: In order to write in Slavic they devised a new alphabet which is now called Glagolitic. Florin Curta & Paul Stephenson, Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500–1250, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 214: At the emperor’s request,  |Constantine|Saint_Cyril_The_Philosopher|  and his brother started the translation of religious texts into Old Church Slavonic, a literary language most likely based on the Macedonian dialect allegedly used in the hinterland of their home-town, Thessalonica. Constantine devised a new alphabet, later called Glagolitic, to render the sounds of the new language and to adapt it to the new conditions iii Moravia. The two brothers seem to have initially translated only texts for religious instruction, such as the excerpts from the Gospels that were used in liturgy. Simon Franklin, Writing, Society and Culture in Early Rus, c. 950–1300, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 93: East Christian Slays used two alphabets, Glagolitic and Cyrillic. Just to confuse matters, the script devised by Cyril was probably Glagolitic, while Cyrillic—which came to predominate, emerged somewhat later. Henri-Jean Martin, The History and Power of Writing, University of Chicago Press, 1995, p. 40 Jean W. Sedlar, East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500, University of Washington Press, 1994, p. 114: Indeed, when a Slavic ruler named Rastislav in the year 863 invited the Byzantine emperor to send him a Christian bishop, the emperor was more than willing. He commissioned two eminent Greeks of Salonika. Constantine and his brother  |Methodius|Saint_Methodius_Of_Thessaloniki| , to develop a written language for the use of the Slavic peoples. These two apostles were not the first to translate religious writings into  |Slavic|Slavic_Languages| , since some preliminary work had been done earlier by Bavarian missionaries. However, they were the first to invent a Slavic alphabet and undertake translations into Slavic on a major scale. It is believed that the original letters were fitted to Macedonian dialects specifically.  The original Glagolitic letters are regarded as having been a good fit for the original system  .
