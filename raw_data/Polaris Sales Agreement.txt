           The Polaris Sales Agreement was a treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom which began the  |UK_Polaris_programme|Uk_Polaris_Programme| . The agreement was signed on 6 April 1963. It formally arranged the terms and conditions under which the  |Polaris|Ugm_27_Polaris|  missile system was provided to the United Kingdom.     The United Kingdom had been planning to buy the air-launched  |Skybolt|Gam_87_Skybolt|  missile to extend the operational life of the British  |V_bombers|V_Bomber| , but the United States decided to cancel the Skybolt program in 1962 as it no longer needed the missile. The crisis created by the cancellation prompted an emergency meeting between the  |President_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States| ,  |John_F_Kennedy|John_F_Kennedy| , and the  |Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| ,  |Harold_Macmillan|Harold_Macmillan| , which resulted in the  |Nassau_Agreement|Nassau_Agreement| , under which the United States agreed to provide Polaris missiles to the United Kingdom instead.     The Polaris Sales Agreement provided for the implementation of the Nassau Agreement. The United States would supply the United Kingdom with Polaris missiles, launch tubes, and the  |fire_control_system|Fire_Control_System| . The United Kingdom would manufacture the warheads and submarines. In return, the US was given certain assurances by the United Kingdom regarding the use of the missile, but not a veto on the use of British nuclear weapons. The British  Polaris  |ballistic_missile_submarines|Ballistic_Missile_Submarine|  were built on time and under budget, and came to be seen as a credible deterrent that enhanced Britains international status.     Along with the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the Polaris Sales Agreement became a pillar of the nuclear  |Special_Relationship|Special_Relationship|  between Britain and the United States. The agreement was amended in 1982 to provide for the sale of the  |Trident_missile|Trident|  system.          During the early part of the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , Britain had a  |nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapons|  project, codenamed  |Tube_Alloys|Tube_Alloys| . In August 1943, the  |Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom| ,  |Winston_Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  and the  |President_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States| ,  |Franklin_Roosevelt|Franklin_Roosevelt| , signed the  |Quebec_Agreement|Quebec_Agreement| , which merged Tube Alloys with the American  |Manhattan_Project|Manhattan_Project| . The British government trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it regarded as a joint discovery, but the 1946  |McMahon_Act|United_States_Atomic_Energy_Act_Of_1946|  ended cooperation. Fearing a resurgence of  |United_States_isolationism|United_States_Isolationism| , and Britain losing its  |great_power|Great_Power|  status, the British government restarted its own development effort, now codenamed  |High_Explosive_Research|High_Explosive_Research| . The first British atomic bomb was tested in  |Operation_Hurricane|Operation_Hurricane|  on 3 October 1952. The subsequent  |British_development_of_the_hydrogen_bomb|British_Hydrogen_Bomb_Programme| , and a favourable international relations climate created by the  |Sputnik_crisis|Sputnik_Crisis| , led to the McMahon Act being amended in 1958, and the restoration of the nuclear  |Special_Relationship|Special_Relationship|  in the form of the  |1958_US–UK_Mutual_Defence_Agreement|1958_Us–Uk_Mutual_Defence_Agreement|  , which allowed Britain to acquire nuclear weapons systems from the United States.     Britains  |nuclear_weapons|Nuclear_Weapon|  armament was initially based on  |free_fall_bombs|Free_Fall_Bomb|  delivered by the  |V_bombers|V_Bomber|  of the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  , but the possibility of the manned bomber becoming obsolete by the late 1960s due to improvements in anti-aircraft defences was foreseen. In 1953, work began on a  |medium_range_ballistic_missile|Medium_Range_Ballistic_Missile|  called  |Blue_Streak|Blue_Streak| , but by 1958, there were concerns about its vulnerability to a  |pre_emptive_nuclear_strike|Pre_Emptive_Nuclear_Strike| . To extend the effectiveness and operational life of the V bombers, an air-launched, rocket-propelled  |standoff_missile|Standoff_Missile|  called  |Blue_Steel|Blue_Steel|  was developed, but it was anticipated that the air defences of the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  would improve to the extent that V bombers might still find it difficult to attack their targets. A solution appeared to be the American  |Skybolt|Agm_48_Skybolt|  missile, which combined the range of Blue Streak with the mobile basing of the Blue Steel, and was small enough that two could be carried on an  |Avro_Vulcan|Avro_Vulcan|  bomber.     An institutional challenge to Skybolt came from the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy| , which was developing a  |submarine_launched_ballistic_missile|Submarine_Launched_Ballistic_Missile|  , the  |UGM_27_Polaris|Ugm_27_Polaris| . The US  |Chief_of_Naval_Operations|Chief_Of_Naval_Operations| ,  |Admiral|Admiral| |_Arleigh_Burke|Arleigh_Burke| , kept the  |First_Sea_Lord|First_Sea_Lord| ,  |Lord_Mountbatten|Lord_Mountbatten| , apprised of its development. By moving the deterrent out to sea, Polaris offered the prospect of a deterrent that was invulnerable to a first strike, and reduced the risk of a nuclear strike on the British Isles. The British Nuclear Deterrent Study Group produced a study that argued that SLBM technology was as yet unproven, that Polaris would be expensive, and that given the time it would take to build the boats, it could not be deployed before the early 1970s. The  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  Defence Committee therefore approved the acquisition of Skybolt in February 1960. The Prime Minister,  |Harold_Macmillan|Harold_Macmillan| , met with the President,  |Dwight_D_Eisenhower|Dwight_D_Eisenhower| , in March 1960, and secured permission to buy Skybolt. In return, the Americans could base the  |US_Navys|Us_Navy|  Polaris  |ballistic_missile_submarines|Ballistic_Missile_Submarine|  in the  |Holy_Loch|Holy_Loch|  in Scotland. The financial arrangement was particularly favourable to Britain, as the US was charging only the  |unit_cost|Unit_Cost|  of Skybolt, absorbing all the research and development costs. With this agreement in hand, the cancellation of Blue Streak was announced in the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  on 13 April 1960.     The subsequent American decision to cancel Skybolt created a political crisis in the UK, and an emergency meeting between Macmillan and President  |John_F_Kennedy|John_F_Kennedy|  was called in  |Nassau_Bahamas|Nassau_Bahamas| . Macmillan rejected the US offers of paying half the cost of developing Skybolt, and of supplying the  |AGM_28_Hound_Dog|Agm_28_Hound_Dog|  missile instead. This brought options down to Polaris, but the Americans would only supply it on condition that it be used as part of a proposed  |Multilateral_Force|Multilateral_Force|  . Kennedy ultimately relented, and agreed to supply Britain with Polaris missiles, while the Prime Minister made it clear that except where Her Majestys Government may decide that supreme national interests are at stake, these British forces will be used for the purposes of international defence of the Western Alliance in all circumstances.  A joint statement to this effect, the  |Nassau_Agreement|Nassau_Agreement| , was issued on 21 December 1962.          With the Nassau Agreement in hand, it remained to work out the details.  |Vice_Admiral|Vice_Admiral| |_Michael_Le_Fanu|Michael_Le_Fanu|  had a meeting with the  |United_States_Secretary_of_Defense|United_States_Secretary_Of_Defense| ,  |Robert_S_McNamara|Robert_S_Mcnamara| , on 21 December 1962, the final day of the Nassau conference. He found McNamara eager to help, and enthusiastic about the idea of Polaris costing as little as possible. The first issue identified was how many Polaris boats should be built. While the Vulcans to carry Skybolt were already in service, the submarines to carry Polaris were not, and there was no provision in the defence budget for them. Some naval officers feared that their construction would adversely impact the  |hunter_killer_submarine|Hunter_Killer_Submarine|  programme. The First Sea Lord,  |Admiral_of_the_Fleet|Admiral_Of_The_Fleet|  Sir  |Caspar_John|Caspar_John| , denounced the millstone of Polaris hung around our necks as potential wreckers of the real navy .     The number of missiles required was based on substituting for Skybolt. To achieve the same capability, the BNDSG calculated that this would require eight Polaris submarines, each of which would have 16 missiles, for a total of 128 missiles, with 128 one-megaton warheads. It was subsequently decided to halve this, based on the decision that the ability to destroy twenty Soviet cities would have nearly as great a deterrent effect as the ability to destroy forty. The  |Admiralty|Admiralty|  considered the possibility of hybrid submarines that could operate as hunter-killers while carrying eight Polaris missiles, but McNamara noted that this would be inefficient, as twice as many submarines would need to be on station to maintain the deterrent, and cautioned that the effect of tinkering with the US Navys 16-missile layout was unpredictable.  |The_Treasury|Hm_Treasury|  costed a four-boat Polaris fleet at £314 million by 1972/73. A Cabinet Defence Committee meeting on 23 January 1963 approved the plan for four boats, with Thorneycroft noting that four boats would be cheaper and faster to build.     A mission led by Sir  |Solly_Zuckerman|Solly_Zuckerman| , the  |Chief_Scientific_Adviser_to_the_Ministry_of_Defence|Chief_Scientific_Adviser_To_The_Ministry_Of_Defence| , left for the United States to discuss Polaris on 8 January 1963. It included the  |Vice_Chief_of_the_Naval_Staff|Vice_Chief_Of_The_Naval_Staff| , Vice Admiral Sir  |Varyl_Begg|Varyl_Begg| ; the Deputy Secretary of the Admiralty, James Mackay; Rear Admiral  |Hugh_Mackenzie|Hugh_Mackenzie| ; and physicist Sir  |Robert_Cockburn|Robert_Cockburn|  and F. J. Doggett from the Ministry of Aviation. That the involvement of the Ministry of Aviation might be a complicating factor was foreseen, but it had experience with nuclear weapons development. Mackenzie had been the  |Flag_Officer_Submarines|Flag_Officer_Submarines|  until 31 December 1962, when Le Fanu had appointed him the Chief Polaris Executive . As such, he was directly answerable to Le Fanu as Controller of the Navy. His CPE staff was divided between London and Foxhill, near  |Bath_Somerset|Bath_Somerset| , where Royal Navy had its ship design, logistics and weapons groups. It was intended as a counterpart to the  |United_States_Navy_Special_Projects_Office|United_States_Navy_Special_Projects_Office|  , with whom it would have to deal.     The principal finding of the Zuckerman mission was that the Americans had developed a new version of the Polaris missile, the A3. With a range extended of , it had a new weapons bay housing three re-entry vehicles and a new   |W58|W58|  warhead to penetrate improved Soviet anti-missile defences expected to become available around 1970. A decision was therefore required on whether to purchase the old A2 missile or the new A3. The Zuckerman mission came out in favour of the new A3 missile, although it was still under development and not expected to enter service until August 1964, as the deterrent would remain credible for much longer. The decision was endorsed by the  |First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty|First_Lord_Of_The_Admiralty| ,  |Lord_Carrington|Lord_Carrington| , in May 1963, and was officially made by Thorneycroft on 10 June 1963.     The choice of the A3 created a problem for the  |Atomic_Weapons_Research_Establishment|Atomic_Weapons_Research_Establishment|  at  |Aldermaston|Aldermaston| , for the Skybolt warhead that had recently been tested in the  |Tendrac_nuclear_test|British_Nuclear_Testing_In_The_United_States|  at the  |Nevada_Test_Site|Nevada_Test_Site|  in the United States would require a redesigned Re-Entry System in order to be fitted to a Polaris missile, at an estimated cost of between £30 million and £40 million. The alternative was to make a British copy of the W58. While the AWRE was familiar with the  |W47|W47|  warhead used in the A2, it knew nothing of the W58. A presidential determination was required to release information on the W58 under the MDA, but with this in hand, a mission led by  |John_Challens|John_Challens| , the Chief of Warhead Development at the AWRE, visited the  |Lawrence_Livermore_Laboratory|Lawrence_Livermore_Laboratory|  from 22 to 24 January 1963, and was shown details of the W58.        The Zuckerman mission found the SPO helpful and forthcoming, but there was one major shock. The British were expected to contribute to the research and development costs of the A3, backdated to 1 January 1963. These were expected to top $700 million by 1968. Skybolt had been offered to the UK at  |unit_cost|Unit_Cost| , with the US absorbing the research and development costs, but no such agreement had been reached at Nassau for Polaris. Thorneycroft baulked at the prospect of paying research and development costs, but McNamara pointed out that the  |United_States_Congress|United_States_Congress|  would not stand for an agreement that placed all the burden on the United States. Macmillan instructed the  |British_Ambassador_to_the_United_States|British_Ambassador_To_The_United_States| , Sir  |David_Ormsby_Gore|David_Ormsby_Gore| , to inform Kennedy that Britain was not willing to commit to an open-ended sharing of research and development costs, but, as a compromise, would pay an additional five per cent for each missile. He asked that Kennedy be informed that a breakdown of the Nassau Agreement would likely cause the fall of his government. Ormsby-Gore met with Kennedy that very day, and while Kennedy noted that the five per cent offer was not the most generous offer he had ever heard of , he accepted it. McNamara, certain that the United States was being ripped off, calculated the five percent on top of not just the missiles, but their fire control and navigation systems as well, adding around £2 million to the bill. On Ormsby-Gores advice, this formulation was accepted.     An American mission now visited the United Kingdom. This was led by  |Paul_H_Nitze|Paul_H_Nitze| , the  |Assistant_Secretary_of_Defense_for_International_Security_Affairs|Assistant_Secretary_Of_Defense_For_International_Security_Affairs| , and included  |Walt_W_Rostow|Walt_W_Rostow| , the  |Director_of_Policy_Planning|Director_Of_Policy_Planning|  at the  |State_Department|State_Department| , and Admiral  |Ignatius_J_Galantin|Ignatius_J_Galantin| , the head of the SPO. The Americans had ideas about how the programme should be organised. They foresaw the  |UK_Polaris_programme|Uk_Polaris_Programme|  having project officers from both countries, with a Joint Steering Task Group that met regularly to provide advice. This was accepted, and would become part of the final agreement. However, a follow-up British mission under Leslie Williams, the Director General Atomic Weapons at the Ministry of Aviation, whose members included Challens and Rear Admiral Frederick Dossor, was given a letter by the SPO with a list of subjects that were off limits. These included  |penetration_aids|Penetration_Aid| , which were held to be outside the scope of the Nassau Agreement.     One remaining obstacle in the path of the programme was how it would be integrated with the MLF. The British response to the MLF concept ranged from unenthusiastic to hostile throughout the military establishment and in the two principal political parties . Apart from anything else, it was estimated to cost as much as £100 million over ten years. Nonetheless, the Foreign Office argued that Britain must support the MLF. The Nassau Agreement had invigorated the MLF effort in the United States. Kennedy appointed  |Livingston_T_Merchant|Livingston_T_Merchant|  to negotiate the MLF with the European governments, which he did in February and March 1963. While reaffirming support for those parts of the Nassau Agreement concerning the MLF, the British were successful in getting them omitted from the Polaris Sales Agreement.        The British team completed drafting the agreement in March 1963, and copies were circulated for discussion. The contracts for their construction were announced that month. The Polaris boats would be the largest submarines built in Britain up to that time, and would be built by  |Vickers_Armstrong_Shipbuilders|Vickers_Shipbuilding_And_Engineering|  in  |Barrow_in_Furness|Barrow_In_Furness|  and  |Cammell_Laird|Cammell_Laird|  in  |Birkenhead|Birkenhead| . For similar reasons to the US Navy, the Royal Navy decided to base the boats at  |Faslane|Faslane| , on the  |Gareloch|Gareloch| , not far from the US Navys base on the Holy Loch. The drawback of the site was that it isolated the Polaris boats from the rest of the navy. The Polaris Sales Agreement was signed in Washington, DC, on 6 April 1963 by Ormsby-Gore and  |Dean_Rusk|Dean_Rusk| , the  |United_States_Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State| .          The two liaison officers were appointed in April; Captain Peter la Niece became the Royal Navy project officer in Washington, DC, while Captain Phil Rollings became the US Navy project officer in London. The Joint Steering Task Group held its first meeting in Washington on 26 June 1963. The shipbuilding programme would prove to be a remarkable achievement, with the four  submarines built on time and within the budget. The first boat,  was launched in September 1966, and commenced its first deterrent patrol in June 1968. The annual running costs of the Polaris boats came to around two per cent of the defence budget, and they came to be seen as a credible deterrent that enhanced Britains international status. Along with the more celebrated 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the Polaris Sales Agreement became a pillar of the nuclear Special Relationship between Britain and the United States.          The Polaris Sales Agreement provided an established framework for negotiations over missiles and re-entry systems. The legal agreement took the form of amending the Polaris Sales Agreement through an exchange of notes between the two governments so that Polaris in the original now also covered the purchase of Trident. There were also some amendments to the classified annexes of the Polaris Sales Agreement to delete the exclusion of penetrating aids. Under the Polaris Sales Agreement, the United Kingdom paid a five per cent levy on the cost of equipment supplied in recognition of US research and development costs already incurred. For Trident, a payment of $116 million was substituted.  The United Kingdom procured the Trident system from America and fitted them to their own submarines, which had only 16 missile tubes like Polaris rather than the 24 in the American . The first , , entered operational service in December 1994, by which time the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  had ended.
