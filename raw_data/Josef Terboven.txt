     Josef Antonius Heinrich Terboven was a  |Nazi|Nazi_Party|  leader, best known as the  |Reichskommissar|Reichskommissar|  for  |Norway|Norway|  during the  |German_occupation_of_Norway|Occupation_Of_Norway_By_Nazi_Germany|  and the  |Quisling_regime|Quisling_Regime| .       Terboven  was born in  |Essen|Essen| , Germany, as the son of minor  |landed_gentry|Landed_Gentry|  of  |Dutch|Netherlands|  descent. He served in the German  |field_artillery|Artillery|  and nascent  |air_force|Luftstreitkräfte|  in  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and was awarded the  |Iron_Cross|Iron_Cross| , rising to the rank of lieutenant. He studied law and political science at the universities of  |Munich|University_Of_Munich|  and  |Freiburg|University_Of_Freiburg| , where he first got involved in politics.       Dropping out of the university in 1923, Terboven joined the  |NSDAP|Nazi_Party|  with member number 25247 and participated in the abortive  |Beer_Hall_Putsch|Beer_Hall_Putsch|  in Munich. When the NSDAP was subsequently outlawed, he found work at a bank for a few years before he was laid off in 1925.     He then went to work full-time for the  |Nazi|Nazism|  party. Terboven helped establish the party in Essen and became  |Gauleiter|Gauleiter| |_there_in_1928|Gau_Essen| . From 1925 on he was part of the  |Sturmabteilung|Sturmabteilung| , in which he reached the rank of  Obergruppenführer  by 1936. On 29 June 1934, Terboven married Ilse Stahl,  |Joseph_Goebbels|Joseph_Goebbels|  former secretary and mistress.  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  was the guest of honour at the wedding. Terboven was made  Oberpräsident der Rheinprovinz  in 1935 and developed a reputation as a petty and ruthless tyrant.             Terboven was made  |Reichskommissar|Reichskommissar|  for  |Norway|Norway|  on 24 April 1940, even before the  |military_invasion|Operation_Weserübung|  was completed on 7 June 1940. He moved into the Norwegian crown princes residence at  |Skaugum|Skaugum|  in September 1940 and made his headquarters in  |Stortinget|Stortinget|  . Ilse and their daughter Inge did not accompany him to Norway, remaining in Germany.     Terboven only had supervisory authority over the civilian administration in Norway. The German civilian administration did not rule Norway directly, however, and remained relatively small. Daily affairs were managed by the existing Norwegian state administration, headed by an acting cabinet and then by the Quisling cabinet. Terboven did not have authority over the 400,000 regular  |German_Army_forces|Wehrmacht|  stationed in Norway which were under the command of General  |Nikolaus_von_Falkenhorst|Nikolaus_Von_Falkenhorst| , but he did command a personal force of around 6,000 men, of whom 800 were part of the secret police.     In contrast to the military forces commanded by Falkenhorst, which aimed to reach an understanding with the Norwegian people and were under orders by Falkenhorst to treat Norwegians with courtesy, Terboven behaved in the same petty and ruthless way he did as governor of the Rheinprovinz, and was widely disliked, not only by the Norwegians, but also by many Germans. From 1941, he increasingly focused on crushing the  |irregular|Irregular_Warfare|  military resistance against the Germans, declaring  |martial_law_in_Trondheim_in_1942|Martial_Law_In_Trondheim_In_1942| , and ordering the destruction of  |Telavåg|Telavåg| .  |Goebbels|Joseph_Goebbels|  expressed annoyance in  |his_diary|Goebbels_Diaries|  about what he called Terbovens bullying tactics against the Norwegians, as they alienated the population against the Germans. Terboven nevertheless remained in ultimate charge of Norway until the end of the war in 1945, even after the proclamation of a Norwegian  |puppet_regime|Puppet_Regime|  under  |Vidkun_Quisling|Vidkun_Quisling| , the  |Quisling_government|Quisling_Government| . On 18 December 1944, Falkenhorst was dismissed from his command for opposing certain radical policies of Terboven.     As the tide of the war turned against Germany, Terbovens personal aspiration was to organise a Fortress Norway  for the Nazi regimes last stand. Hitlers successor,  |Admiral_Dönitz|Karl_Dönitz| , dismissed Terboven from his post as Reichskommissar on 7 May, transferring his powers to General Böhme.       Terboven also planned  |concentration_camps|Concentration_Camp|  in Norway, establishing  |Falstad_concentration_camp|Falstad_Concentration_Camp|  near  |Levanger|Levanger|  and  |Bredtvet_concentration_camp|Bredtvet_Concentration_Camp|  in  |Oslo|Oslo|  in late 1941.     On 18 July 1942 the  |Beisfjord_massacre|Beisfjord_Massacre|  occurred. Terboven ordered the massacre a few days earlier.     In July 1942 at least one German guard employed by the  |Korgen|Korgen|  prison camp was killed. The commandant ordered retribution: execution by gunfire for 39 prisoners at Korgen and 20 at  |Osen|Vefsn|  ; in the days that followed, Terboven also ordered retribution: around 400 prisoners shot and killed in various camps.        With the announcement of  |Germanys_surrender|German_Instrument_Of_Surrender| , Terboven committed  |suicide|Suicide|  on 8 May 1945 by detonating 50  kg of  |dynamite|Dynamite|  in a bunker  on the  |Skaugum|Skaugum|  compound. He died alongside the body of  Obergruppenführer   |Wilhelm_Rediess|Wilhelm_Rediess| ,  |SS_and_Police_Leader|Ss_And_Police_Leader|  and commander of all  |SS|Ss|  troops in Norway, who had shot himself earlier. His family survived him in West Germany, and Ilse died in 1972.       In the 1965 film  The Heroes of Telemark , Josef Terboven was played by English actor  |Eric_Porter|Eric_Porter| .     He is portrayed in the 1996 film  Hamsun  by  |Edgar_Selge|Edgar_Selge| .             from  |Deutsches_Historisches_Museum|Deutsches_Historisches_Museum|   from  |Historisches_Centrum_Hagen|Historisches_Centrum_Hagen|                                                                        .
