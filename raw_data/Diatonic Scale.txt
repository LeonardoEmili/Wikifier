          In  |music_theory|Music_Theory| , a diatonic scale is a  |heptatonic_scale|Heptatonic_Scale|  that includes five  |whole_steps|Whole_Step|   and two  |half_steps|Half_Step|   in each octave, in which the two half steps are separated from each other by either two or three whole steps, depending on their position in the scale. This pattern ensures that, in a diatonic scale spanning more than one octave, all the half steps are  |maximally_separated|Maximal_Evenness|  from each other .     The seven  |pitches|Pitch|  of any diatonic scale can also be obtained by using a  |chain|Interval_Cycle|  of six  |perfect_fifths|Perfect_Fifth| . For instance, the seven  |natural|Natural|  pitches that form the C- |major_scale|Major_Scale|  can be obtained from a stack of perfect fifths starting from F:   :F—C—G—D—A—E—B     Any sequence of seven successive  |natural_notes|Natural_Note| , such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, and any  |transposition|Transposition|  thereof, is a diatonic scale. Modern  |musical_keyboards|Musical_Keyboard|  are designed so that the white notes form a diatonic scale, though transpositions of this diatonic scale require one or more black keys. A diatonic scale can be also described as two  |tetrachords|Tetrachord|  separated by a  |whole_tone|Whole_Tone| .     The term  diatonic  originally referred to the  |diatonic_genus|Diatonic_Genus| , one of the three  |genera|Genus|  of the ancient Greeks. In  |musical_set_theory|Set_Theory| ,  |Allen_Forte|Allen_Forte|  classifies diatonic scales as  |set_form|Set_Form|  7–35.     This article does not concern alternative seven-note scales such as the  |harmonic_minor|Harmonic_Minor|  or the  |melodic_minor|Melodic_Minor|  which, although sometimes called diatonic , do not fulfill the condition of maximal separation of the semitones indicated above.       Western music from the  |Middle_Ages|Medieval_Music|  until the  |late_19th_century|Romantic_Music|   is based on the diatonic scale and the unique  |hierarchical|Hierarchy|  relationships created by this system of organizing seven notes.          There is a claim that the 45,000-year-old  |Divje_Babe_Flute|Divje_Babe_Flute|  used a diatonic scale; however, there is no proof or consensus of it even being a musical instrument. Random Samples , Science April 1997, vol 276 no 5310 pp 203–205 .     There is evidence that the  |Sumer|Sumer| ians and  |Babylonia|Babylonia| ns used a version of the diatonic scale.   This derives from surviving inscriptions that contain a tuning system and musical composition. Despite the conjectural nature of reconstructions of the piece known as the  |Hurrian_songs|Hurrian_Songs|  from the surviving score, the evidence that it used the diatonic scale is much more soundly based. This is because instructions for tuning the scale involve tuning a chain of six fifths, so that the corresponding circle of seven  |major|Major_Third|  and  |minor|Minor_Third|  thirds are all consonant-sounding, and this is a recipe for tuning a diatonic scale.     The 9,000-year-old  |flutes|Gudi|  found in  |Jiahu|Jiahu| , China indicate the evolution, over a period of 1,200 years, of flutes having 4, 5 and 6 holes to having 7 and 8 holes, the latter exhibiting striking similarity to diatonic hole spacings and sounds.        The scales corresponding to the medieval  |church_modes|Church_Modes|  were diatonic. Depending on which of the seven notes of the diatonic scale you use as the beginning, the positions of the intervals fall at different distances from the starting tone , producing seven different scales. One of these, the  |one_starting_on_B|Locrian_Mode| , has no pure fifth above its reference note  instead of a B–C–D    C–D–E–F–G–A–B–C was described as F–G–A–B–C–D–E–F      As a result, medieval theory described the church modes as corresponding to four diatonic scales only .        |Heinrich_Glarean|Heinrich_Glarean|  considered that the modal scales including a B had to be the result of a transposition. In his  Dodecachordon , he not only described six natural diatonic scales , but also six transposed ones, each including a B, resulting in the total of twelve scales that justified the title of his treatise.       By the beginning of the  |Baroque|Baroque_Music|  period, the notion of the musical  |key|Key|  was established, describing additional possible transpositions of the diatonic scale.  |Major|Major_Scale|  and  |minor_scales|Minor_Scale|  came to dominate until at least the start of the 20th century, partly because their intervallic patterns are suited to the reinforcement of a central  |triad|Triad| . Some church modes survived into the early 18th century, as well as appearing in  |classical|Classical_Period|  and  |20th_century_music|20Th_Century_Music| , and  |jazz|Jazz|  .          Of Glareans six natural scales, three are major scales , and three are minor . To these may be added the seventh diatonic scale, with a diminished fifth above the reference note, the  |Locrian|Locrian_Mode|  scale. These could be transposed not only to include one flat in the signature , but to all twelve notes of the  |chromatic_scale|Chromatic_Scale| , resulting in a total of eighty-four diatonic scales.     The modern  |musical_keyboard|Musical_Keyboard|  originated as a diatonic keyboard with only white keys. Meeùs, N. . Keyboard. Grove Music Online. Retrieved 9 May. 2018, from . The black keys were progressively added for several purposes:     improving the consonances, mainly the thirds, by providing a major third on each degree;   allowing all twelve transpositions described above;   and helping musicians to find their bearings on the keyboard.     The pattern of elementary intervals forming the diatonic scale can be represented either by the letters T  and S  respectively. With this abbreviation, major scale, for instance, can be represented as     :T–T–S–T–T–T–S          The  |major_scale|Major_Scale|  or  |Ionian|Ionian_Mode|  scale is one of the diatonic scales. It is made up of seven distinct  |notes|Musical_Note| , plus an eighth that duplicates the first an  |octave|Octave|  higher. The pattern of seven intervals separating the eight notes is T–T–S–T–T–T–S. In  |solfege|Solfege| , the syllables used to name each  |degree|Degree|  of the scale are Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Ti–Do. A sequence of successive  |natural_notes|Natural_Note|  starting from C is an example of major scale, called  |C_major|C_Major|  scale.        The eight degrees of the scale are also known by traditional names, especially when used in a tonal context:   :1st –  |Tonic|Tonic|    :2nd –  |Supertonic|Supertonic|    :3rd –  |Mediant|Mediant|    :4th –  |Subdominant|Subdominant|    :5th –  |Dominant|Dominant|    :6th –  |Submediant|Submediant|    :7th –  |Leading_tone|Leading_Tone|    :8th –  |Tonic|Tonic|            For each major scale, there is a corresponding  |natural_minor_scale|Minor_Scalenatural_Minor_Scale| , sometimes called its  |relative_minor|Relative_Key| . It uses the same sequence of notes as the corresponding major scale but starts from a different note. That is, it begins on the sixth degree of the major scale and proceeds step-by-step to the first octave of the sixth degree. A sequence of successive  |natural_notes|Natural_Note|  starting from A is an example of a  |natural_minor_scale|Natural_Minor_Scale| , called the A natural minor scale.        The degrees of the natural minor scale, especially in a tonal context, have the same names as those of the major scale, except the seventh degree, which is known as the  |subtonic|Subtonic|  because it is a whole step below the tonic. The term  |leading_tone|Leading_Tone|  is generally reserved for seventh degrees that are a half step below the tonic, as is the case in the major scale.     Besides the natural minor scale, five other kinds of scales can be obtained from the notes of a major scale, by simply choosing a different note as the starting note. All these scales meet the definition of diatonic scale.          The whole collection of diatonic scales as defined above can be divided into seven different scales.     As explained above, all  |major_scales|Major_Scale|  use the same interval sequence T–T–S–T–T–T–S. This interval sequence was called the Ionian mode by Glarean. It is one of the seven modern modes. From any major scale, a new scale is obtained by taking a different  |degree|Degree|  as the tonic. With this method it is possible to generate six other scales or modes from each major scale. Another way to describe the same result would be to consider that, behind the diatonic scales, there exists an underlying diatonic system which is the series of diatonic notes without a reference note; assigning the reference note in turn to each of the seven notes in each octave of the system produces seven diatonic scales, each characterized by a different interval sequence:          For the sake of simplicity, the examples shown above are formed by  |natural_notes|Natural_Note|  . However, any  |transposition|Transposition|  of each of these scales is a valid example of the corresponding mode. In other words, transposition preserves mode.     The whole set of diatonic scales is commonly defined as the set composed of these seven natural-note scales, together with all of their possible transpositions. As discussed  |elsewhere|Diatonic_And_Chromaticdiatonic_Scales| , different definitions of this set are sometimes adopted in the literature.            A diatonic scale can be also described as two  |tetrachords|Tetrachordromantic_Era|  separated by a  |whole_tone|Whole_Tone| . For example, under this view the two tetrachord structures of C  major would be:   : –   each tetrachord being formed of two tones and a semitone, T T S,     and the natural minor of A would be:   : –   formed two different tetrachords, the first consisting in a semitone between two tones, T S T, and the second of a semitone and two tones, S T T.     The medieval conception of the tetrachordal structure, however, was based on one single tetrachord, that of the D scale,   : –   each formed of a semitone between tones, T S T. It viewed other diatonic scales as differently overlapping disjunct and conjunct tetrachords:   :E scale: E–F–G   A–B–C–D D–E   :F scale: F–G   A–B–C–D D–E–F   :G scale: G   A–B–C–D D–E–F–G   :A scale: A–B–C–D D–E–F–G   A   :B scale: B–C–D D–E–F–G   A–B   :C scale: C–D D–E–F–G   A–B–C   .       Diatonic scales can be tuned variously, either by iteration of a perfect or tempered fifth, or by a combination of perfect fifths and perfect thirds , or possibly by a combination of fifths and thirds of various sizes, as in  |well_temperament|Well_Temperament| .          If the scale is produced by the iteration of six perfect fifths, for instance F–C–G–D–A–E–B, the result is  |Pythagorean_tuning|Pythagorean_Tuning|      Six of the fifth intervals are all  1.5 , but B–F′ is the discordant  |tritone|Tritone| , here  1.423828125 . Tones are each  1.125 and diatonic semitones are  ≈ 1.0535 .     Extending the series of fifths to eleven fifths would result into the Pythagorean  |Chromatic_scale|Chromatic_Scale| .          Equal temperament is the division of the octave in twelve equal semitones. The frequency ratio of the semitone then becomes the  |twelfth_root_of_two|Twelfth_Root_Of_Two|  . The tone is the sum of two semitone. Its ratio is the sixth root of two . Equal temperament can be produced by a succession of tempered fifths, each of them with the ratio of 2  ≈ 1.498307, 700 cents.          The fifths could be tempered more than in equal temperament, in order to produce better thirds. See  |quarter_comma_meantone|Quarter_Comma_Meantone|  for a meantone temperament commonly used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and sometimes after, which produces perfect major thirds.          Just intonation often is represented using Eulers  |Tonnetz|Tonnetz| , with the horizontal axis showing the perfect fifths and the vertical axis the perfect major thirds. In the Tonnetz, the diatonic scale in just intonation appears as follows:          F–A, C–E and G–B, aligned vertically, are perfect major thirds; A–E–B and F–C–G–D are two series of perfect fifths. The notes of the top line, A, E and B, are lowered by the  |syntonic_comma|Syntonic_Comma| , , and the wolf fifth D–A is too narrow by the same amount. The tritone F–B is  ≈ 1.40625.     This tuning has been first described by  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy|  and is known as  |Ptolemys_intense_diatonic_scale|Ptolemys_Intense_Diatonic_Scale| . It was also mentioned by Zarlino in the 16th century and has been described by theorists in the 17th and 18th centuries as the natural scale.        Since the frequency ratios are based on simple powers of the prime numbers 2,3 and 5 this is also known as  |Five_limit_tuning|Five_Limit_Tuning| .
