              A salute is a  |gesture|Gesture|  or other action used to display  |respect|Respect| . Salutes are primarily associated with  |armed_forces|Armed_Forces| , but other organizations and civilians also use salutes.             In military traditions of various times and places, there have been numerous methods of performing salutes, using  |hand|Hand|  gestures,  |cannon|Cannon|  or  |rifle|Rifle|  shots, hoisting of  |flags|Flag| , removal of  |headgear|Headgear| , or other means of showing respect or deference. In the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| , only commissioned  |officers|Officer|  are saluted, and the salute is to the commission they carry from their respective commanders-in-chief representing the Monarch, not the officers themselves.     The British Armys salute is almost identical to the French salute, with the palm facing outward. The customary salute in the  |Polish_Armed_Forces|Polish_Armed_Forces|  is the  |two-fingers_salute|Two-Fingers_Salute| , a variation of the British military salute with only two fingers extended. In the  |Russian_military|Armed_Forces_Of_The_Russian_Federation| , the right hand, palm down, is brought to the right temple, almost, but not quite, touching; the head has to be covered. In the  |Hellenic_Army|Hellenic_Army|  salute, the palm is facing down and the fingers point to the coat of arms.     In the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy| ,  |United_States_Marine_Corps|United_States_Marine_Corps| ,  |United_States_Coast_Guard|United_States_Coast_Guard| ,  |United_States_Public_Health_Service_Commissioned_Corps|United_States_Public_Health_Service_Commissioned_Corps| ,  |Colombian_Army|Colombian_Army|  and  |Ecuadorian_Army|Ecuadorian_Army| , as well as in all branches of the  |French_Armed_Forces|French_Armed_Forces| ,  |Spanish_Armed_Forces|Spanish_Armed_Forces| ,  |British_Armed_Forces|British_Armed_Forces|  ,  |Canadian_Forces|Canadian_Forces| ,  |Danish_Armed_Forces|Danish_Defence| ,  |Hellenic_Armed_Forces|Hellenic_Armed_Forces| ,  |Italian_Armed_Forces|Italian_Armed_Forces| ,  |Norwegian_Armed_Forces|Norwegian_Armed_Forces| ,  |Polish_Armed_Forces|Polish_Armed_Forces| , Irish Defence Forces,  |Australian_Defence_Force|Australian_Defence_Force| ,  |South_African_National_Defence_Force|South_African_National_Defence_Force| ,  Swedish Defence Forces,  |Turkish_Armed_Forces|Turkish_Armed_Forces| ,  |Portuguese_Armed_Forces|Portuguese_Armed_Forces|  and  |Russian|Russian_Armed_Forces|  and all former Soviet republic forces, hand salutes are only given when a  |cover|Cover|   is worn.     When the presence of enemy  |snipers|Sniper|  is suspected, military salutes are generally forbidden, since the enemy may use them to recognize officers as valuable targets.       Some soldiers may salute with the left hand when the right hand is encumbered in some way , for example, a soldier with a rifle at Right Shoulder Arms; if movement of a weapon would be encumbered when making the armed salute; if the performance of duty requires the right hand for use or operation of equipment such as riding a motorcycle; if it is not possible to use the hand due to injury or amputation; when escorting a woman and it is not possible to walk on her right side. A right-handed boatswain Mate piping an Officer aboard may salute with his/her left hand.          According to some modern military manuals, the modern Western salute originated in France when  |knights|Knight|  greeted each other to show friendly intentions by raising their  |visors|Visor|  to show their faces, using a salute. Others also note that the raising of ones visor was a way to identify oneself saying This is who I am, and I am not afraid. Medieval visors were, to this end, equipped with a protruding spike that allowed the visor to be raised using a saluting motion.       The US Army Quartermaster School provides another explanation of the origin of the hand salute: that it was a long-established  |military_courtesy|Military_Courtesy|  for subordinates to remove their headgear in the presence of superiors. As late as the American Revolution, a British Army soldier saluted by removing his hat. With the advent of increasingly cumbersome headgear in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, the act of removing ones hat was gradually converted into the simpler gesture of grasping or touching the visor and issuing a courteous salutation.     As early as 1745, a British order book stated that: The men are ordered not to pull off their hats when they pass an officer, or to speak to them, but only to clap up their hands to their hats and bow as they pass. Over time, it became conventionalized into something resembling the modern hand salute. , US Army Quartermaster Center & School, retrieved 27 September 2014 In the Austrian Army the practice of making a hand salute replaced that of removing the headdress in 1790, although officers wearing  |cocked_hats|Bicorne|  continued to remove them when greeting superiors until 1868.      The naval salute, with the palm downwards is said to have evolved because the palms of naval ratings, particularly  |deckhands|Sailor| , were often dirty through working with lines and was deemed insulting to present a dirty palm to an officer; thus the palm was turned downwards. During the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , British crews saluted officers by touching a clenched fist to the brow as though grasping a hat-brim between fingers and thumb.               When carrying a sword , European military forces and their cultural descendants use a two-step gesture. The sword is first raised, in the right hand, to the level of and close to the front of the neck. The blade is inclined forward and up 30 degrees from the vertical; the true edge is to the left. Then the sword is slashed downward to a position with the point close to the ground in front of the right foot. The blade is inclined down and forward with the true edge to the left. This gesture originated in the  |Crusades|Crusades| . The  |hilt|Hilt|  of a  |sword|Sword|  formed a cross with the blade, so if a  |crucifix|Crucifix|  was not available, a Crusader could kiss the hilt of his sword when praying, before entering battle, for oaths and vows, and so on. The lowering of the point to the ground is a traditional act of submission.     In  |fencing|Fencing| , the fencers salute each other before putting their masks on to begin a bout. There are several methods of doing this, but the most common is to bring the sword in front of the face so that the blade is pointing up in front of the nose. The fencers also salute the referee and the audience.     When armed with a rifle, two methods are available when saluting. The usual method is called  |present_arms|Present_Arms|  ; the rifle is brought to the vertical, muzzle up, in front of center of the chest with the trigger away from the body. The hands hold the stock close to the positions they would have if the rifle were being fired, though the trigger is not touched. Less formal salutes include the order arms salute and the shoulder arms salutes. These are most often given by a sentry to a low-ranking superior who does not rate the full present arms salute. In the order arms salute, the rifle rests on its butt by the sentrys right foot, held near the muzzle by the sentrys right hand, and does not move. The sentry brings his flattened left hand across his body and touches the rifle near its muzzle. When the rifle is being carried on the shoulder, a similar gesture is used in which the flattened free hand is brought across the body to touch the rifle near the rear of the receiver.     A different type of salute with a rifle is a ritual firing performed during military funerals, known as a  |three-volley_salute|Three-Volley_Salute| . In this ceremonial act, an  |odd_number|Parity|  of rifleman fire three blank cartridges in unison into the air over the casket. This originates from an old European tradition wherein a battle was halted to remove the dead and wounded, then three shots were fired to signal readiness to reengage.                    The custom of firing cannon salutes originated in the  |Royal_Navy|Royal_Navy| . When a cannon was fired, it partially disarmed the ship, so needlessly firing a cannon showed respect and trust. As a matter of courtesy a warship would fire her guns harmlessly out to sea, to show that she had no hostile intent. At first, ships were required to fire seven guns, and forts, with their more numerous guns and a larger supply of gunpowder, to fire 21 times. Later, as the quality of gunpowder improved, the British increased the number of shots required from ships to match the forts.     The system of odd numbered rounds originated from  |Samuel_Pepys|Samuel_Pepys| , Secretary to the Navy in the  |Restoration|English_Restoration| , as a way of economising on the use of powder, the rule until that time having been that all guns had to be fired. Odd numbers were chosen, as even numbers indicated a death.      As naval customs evolved, the  |21-gun_salute|21-Gun_Salute|  came to be reserved for  |heads_of_state|Head_Of_State| , with fewer rounds used to salute lower-ranking officials. Today, In the US Armed Forces,  |heads_of_government|Head_Of_Government|  and cabinet ministers , and military officers with  |five-star_rank|Five-Star_Rank|  receive 19 rounds;  |four-stars|Four-Star_Rank|  receive 17 rounds;  |three-stars|Three-Star_Rank|  receive 15;  |two-stars|Two-Star_Rank|  receive 13; and a  |one-star|One-Star_Rank|  general or admiral receives 11. These same standards are currently adhered to by ground-based saluting batteries.     Multiples of 21-gun salutes may be fired for particularly important celebrations. In monarchies this is often done at births of members of the royal family of the country and other official celebrations associated with the royal family.       A specialty platoon of the  |3rd_US_Infantry_Regiment|3Rd_Us_Infantry_Regiment| , the Presidential Salute Battery is based at  |Fort_Myer|Fort_Myer| , Virginia. The Guns Platoon has the task of rendering military honors in the  |National_Capital_Region|Washington_Metropolitan_Area| , including  |armed_forces_full-honors_funerals|Military_Funeral| ;  |state_funerals|State_Funerals_In_The_United_States| ;  |presidential_inaugurations|United_States_Presidential_Inauguration| ; full-honors  |wreath|Wreath|  ceremonies at the  |Tomb_of_the_Unknowns|Tomb_Of_The_Unknowns|  in  |Arlington_National_Cemetery|Arlington_National_Cemetery| ;  |state_arrivals|State_Arrival_Ceremony|  at the White House and  |Pentagon|The_Pentagon| , and retirement ceremonies for  |general-grade_officers|General_Officer|  in the  |Military_District_of_Washington|Military_District_Of_Washington| , which are normally conducted at Fort Myer.     The Presidential Salute Battery also participates in  |A_Capitol_Fourth|A_Capitol_Fourth| , the Washington  |Independence_Day|Independence_Day|  celebration; the guns accompany the  |National_Symphony_Orchestra|National_Symphony_Orchestra|  in performing the  |1812_Overture|1812_Overture|  .     The platoon maintains its battery of ten ceremonially-modified World War II-vintage  |M-5|3_Inch_Gun_M5| |anti-tank_guns|Anti-Tank_Guns|  at the Old Guard regimental motor pool.       A ceremonial or celebratory form of aerial salute is the  |flypast|Flypast|  , which often follows major parades such as the annual  |Trooping_the_Colour|Trooping_The_Colour|  in the United Kingdom or the French  |défilé_du_14_juillet|Bastille_Day_Military_Parade| . It is seen in other countries as well, notably Singapore and Canada. In Singapore, the  |Republic_of_Singapore_Air_Force|Republic_Of_Singapore_Air_Force|  usually conducts aerial salutes during the annual  |National_Day_Parade|Singapore_National_Day_Parade|  and major state events, such as during the  |funeral_of_Lee_Kuan_Yew|Death_Of_Lee_Kuan_Yew| .     Gun salute by aircraft, primarily displayed during funerals, began with simple flypasts during  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  and have evolved into the  |missing_man_formation|Missing_Man_Formation| , where either a formation of aircraft is conspicuously missing an element, or where a single plane abruptly leaves a formation     A casual salute by an aircraft, somewhat akin to waving to a friend, is the custom of waggling the wings by partially rolling the aircraft first to one side, and then the other.         In both countries, the right-hand salute is generally identical to, and drawn from the traditions of, the British armed forces. The salute of the Australian or New Zealand Army is best described as the right arm taking the path of the longest way up and then the shortest way down. Similar in many ways, the salute of the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force takes the longest way up and the shortest way down. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy, however, take the shortest way up, palm down, and the shortest way down. The action of the arm rotating up is slower than the action of the conclusion of the salute which is the arm being quickly snapped down to the saluters side. Junior members are required to salute first and the senior member is obliged to return the compliment. Protocol dictates that the Monarch, members of the Royal Family, the Governor-General and State Governors are to be saluted at all times by all ranks. Except where a Drill Manual protocol dictates otherwise, the duration of the salute is timed at three beats of the quick-time march , timed from the moment the senior member first returns it. In situations where cover is not being worn, the salute is given verbally; the junior party will first come to attention, then offer the salute Good morning/afternoon Your Majesty/Your Royal Highness/Prime Minister/Your Grace/Sir/Maam , etc., as the case may be. It is this, rather than the act of standing to attention, which indicates that a salute is being offered. If either party consists of two or more members, all will come to attention, but only the most senior member of the party will offer the physical or verbal salute. The party which is wearing headdress must always offer, or respond with, a full salute. At the Forward Edge of the Battle Area no salutes of any kind are given, under any circumstances; it is always sensible to assume that there are snipers in the area. In this case, parties personally known to each other are addressed familiarly by their first or given names, regardless of rank; senior officers are addressed as one might address a stranger, courteously, but without any naming or mark of respect.                    General Jacks Diary ed by John Terraine The salute is given to acknowledge the Queens commission. A salute may not be given unless a soldier is wearing his regimental headdress, for example a  |beret|Beret| ,  |caubeen|Caubeen| ,  |Tam_o_Shanter|Tam_O_Shanter| ,  |Glengarry|Glengarry| , field service cap or peaked cap. This does not apply to members of The Blues and Royals The Household Cavalry who, after The  |Battle_of_Warburg|Battle_Of_Warburg|  were allowed to salute without headdress. If a soldier or officer is not wearing headdress then he or she must come to attention instead of giving/returning the salute. The subordinate salutes first and maintains the salute until the superior has responded in kind.     There is a widespread though erroneous belief that it is statutory for all ranks to salute a bearer of the  |Victoria_Cross|Victoria_Cross|  . There is no official requirement that appears in the official Warrant of the VC, nor in Queens Regulations and Orders, but tradition dictates that this occurs and as such the Chiefs of Staff will salute a Private awarded either a VC or  |George_Cross|George_Cross| .      Therefore, when a subordinate airman salutes an officer, he is indirectly acknowledging Her Majesty as Head of State. A salute returned by the officer is on behalf of the Queen.     The RAF salute is similar to the British Army, the hand is brought upwards in a circular motion out from the body, it is stopped 1 inch to the rear of the right of the right eye, the elbow and wrist are kept inline with the shoulder. The hand is then brought straight down back to the position of attention, this movement is completed to the timing UP TWO-THREE/DOWN Air Officer Administration Headquarters Personnel and Training Command.
