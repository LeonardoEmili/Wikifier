                              is a televised  |anime|Anime|  series, produced and animated by  |Nippon_Sunrise|Sunrise| . Created and directed by  |Yoshiyuki_Tomino|Yoshiyuki_Tomino| , it premiered in Japan on  |Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network|Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network|  and its affiliated  |ANN|Ann|  stations on April 7, 1979, and lasted until January 26, 1980, spanning 43 episodes. It was the very first  Gundam  series, which has subsequently been adapted into numerous sequels and spin-offs. Set in the futuristic  |calendar_year|Calendar_Year| |Universal_Century|Universal_Century|  0079, the plot focuses on the war between the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation, with the latter unveiling a new  |giant_robot|Mecha|  known as the  |RX-78-2_Gundam|Gundam|  piloted by the teenage civilian mechanic  |Amuro_Ray|Amuro_Ray| .     In 1981, the series was re-edited for theatrical release and split into three movies. The characters were designed by  |Yoshikazu_Yasuhiko|Yoshikazu_Yasuhiko| , and  |Kunio_Okawara|Kunio_Okawara|  was responsible for the mechanical designs, including the eponymous giant robot, the RX-78-2 Gundam. The first movie was released on February 22, 1981. Tomino himself also wrote a trilogy of novels that retell the events of the series. Two  |manga|Manga|  adaptations of the series have also been written by two  |manga_artists|Mangaka| .     Despite initial low ratings that caused the series cancellation, the popularity of Gundam saw a boost from the introduction of  |Bandais|Bandai| |Gunpla_models|Gundam_Model|  in 1980 and from  |reruns|Reruns|  and the theatrical release of the anime, leading to the creation of a prolific and lucrative media and toy franchise. The series is famous for revolutionizing the giant robot genre due to the handling of mobile suits as weapons of war as well as the portrayal of their pilots as ordinary soldiers, as opposed to the previous style of portraying hero pilots and their giant super hero robots.          Set in a  |fictional_universe|Fictional_Universe|  in the year  |2179|2179|  , the Principality of Zeon has declared independence from the Earth Federation, and subsequently launched a war of independence called the One Year War. The conflict has directly affected every continent on Earth, also nearly every space colony and lunar settlement. Zeon, though smaller, has the tactical upper hand through their use of a new type of humanoid weapons called mobile suits. After half of all humanity perishes in the conflict, the war settled into a bitter stalemate lasting over 8 months.     The story begins with a newly deployed Federation warship, the  White Base , arriving at the secret research base located at the Side 7 colony to pick up the Federations newest weapon. However, they are closely followed by Zeon forces. A Zeon reconnaissance team member disobeys mission orders and attacks the colony, killing most of the Federation crew and civilians in the process. Out of desperation, young  |Amuro_Ray|Amuro_Ray|  accidentally finds the Federations new prototype arsenal—the  |RX-78_Gundam|Gundam| , and manages to beat back Zeon forces. Scrambling everything they can, the White Base sets out with her newly formed crew of civilian recruits and refugees in her journey to survive.     On their journey, the White Base members often encounter the Zeon Lieutenant Commander  |Char_Aznable|Char_Aznable| . Although Char antagonizes Amuro in battle, he takes advantage of their position as Federation members to have them kill members from Zeons Zabi family as part of his revenge scheme. Amuro also meets ensign  |Lalah_Sune|Lalah_Sune|  with whom he falls in love, but accidentally kills when facing Char. When the Federation Forces invade the Fortress of A Baoa Qu to defeat the Zeon forces, Amuro engages on a final one-on-one duel against Char due to both blaming the other for Lalahs death. Having realized he forgot his true enemy, Char stops fighting to kill the last surviving Zabi member, Kycilia Zabi. Amuro then reunites with his comrades as the war reaches its end.          The Mobile Suits of the show were inspired by the  |powered_armor|Powered_Exoskeleton|  from the novel  Starship Troopers  from 1959.  Mobile suits were conceptualized as human-like robots which would not only appeal to children.  Yoshiyuki Tominos original plot for the anime was considerably much more grim, with Amuro dying halfway through the series, and the crew of the White Base having to ally with Char , but finally having to battle him after he takes control of the Principality of Zeon. The original concept found expression in a series of novels written by Tomino soon after the shows conclusion, and elements of the storyline weaved themselves into  Zeta Gundam  and  Chars Counterattack .     In previous series Tomino worked in, villains were alien agents. Mobile Suit Gundam was the first of his work which featured humans as antagonists. The director commented he wanted to tell a story about war. He aimed to expose thoroughly starting with Japanese aggression in Manchuria in 1939. Tomino did not allow for changes to history and wanted to use the story to make viewers confront the tragic realities of war. The director was unwilling to discuss the message of his work, expecting the viewers to reach their own conclusion. Additionally, he commented he packed his frustrations when making Gundam.      Tomino met mechanical designer  |Kunio_Okawara|Kunio_Okawara|  when he first worked in two television series from Sunrise. Tomino liked Okawaras work and asked him to collaborate with him in his upcoming project. Originally, the anime would be called Gunboy but it was renamed Mobile Suit Gundam.  The White Base, the mothership of the protagonist crew members, is designed with a 3 plane view method by Kunio Okawara, however, it is not specially designed for the anime series Gundam, it was actually a salvaged design from the anime  Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3 . Gundam Century Renewal Version, Kishosha, March 15, 2000,  The idea of having a space carrier from Tomino is partly inspired by the earlier science fiction anime  Space Battleship Yamato , in which he claimed to be a fan of. It was intended to be in a more realistic black color, but was changed to white by the order of Sunrise, similar to the color change of the main mecha Gundam was changed from a grayish white to white, red, blue and yellow. Director Tomino showed great disgust in the color change, also noticing the unrealistic non-aerodynamic design of it after the show was on air, said in an interview that such design would never appear in the real world, since it would be a sitting duck from fighter aircraft. Tomino still held a grudge 10 years after the show aired and stated in an interview in  Newtype  1989 April issue that the imaginary enemies of Gundam are Sunrise, sponsors and television stations. Newtype magazine 1989 April Issue     Tomino compares the machines with religious history in Japan, most notably the worship of  |Buddha|Buddha|  statues located in temples. The relationship between the pilot and the mobile suit has also been compared with the  |Formula_One|Formula_One|  drivers who rely on machines to achieve a goal.  In order to give the mechas fast movements, most of the fights were situated in space where there was no gravity. This led to the creation of space colonies as a common setting. In order to explain how could such a young man as Amuro pilot the Gundam, the team came up with the idea of making him a Newtype.           In February 1980, Mobile Suit Gundam was aired in Italy, the first country to broadcast the show outside Japan.  Mobile Suit Gundam was also later aired by the anime satellite television network,  |Animax|Animax| , across Japan, with the series continuing to be aired on the network currently, and later its respective networks worldwide, including Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions.     Hoping to capitalize on the success of  Gundam Wing  from the previous year,  |Bandai_Entertainment|Bandai_Entertainment|  released a heavily edited and English-dubbed version of Mobile Suit Gundam, premiering on  |Cartoon_Networks|Cartoon_Network| |Toonami|Toonami|  weekday afternoon after-school action programming block across the United States on Monday, July 23, 2001. The series did not do as well as Wing but the ratings were high enough for the whole series to be aired and to spawn an enormous toy line. Due to the  |September_11th_attacks|September_11Th_Attacks| , Cartoon Network, like many other American TV stations, began pulling, and editing, war-themed content and violent programming, resulting in the cancellation of the series. However, the series finale was shown as part of Toonamis New Years Eve-il special on December 31, 2001  interview and the unaired episodes were aired in reruns during 2002.     On Saturday, June 8, 2002, the series was given another chance by Cartoon Network on their late-night  |Adult_Swim|Adult_Swim|  block, but it was again pulled before completing its run because of low ratings.     On May 30, 2006, Bandai Entertainment re-released the English dub of the TV series in a 10 volume DVD set.  Rotten Tomatoes page of the first volume. There was no Japanese audio track included, apparently because  |Yoshiyuki_Tomino|Yoshiyuki_Tomino|  felt that the original mono mix was in too poor of a condition to use.  & nameSections & fileindex & reqviewarticle & artid40 & page1 However, in 2007 the original series was released on DVD in Japan, which sold over 100,000 copies within a months time from December 21, 2007 to January 21, 2008. Otona no Gundam, Adults Gundam, Nikki Entertainment     At the 2010  |New_York_Comic_Con|New_York_Comic_Con| / |New_York_Anime_Festival|New_York_Anime_Festival| , Bandai Entertainment announced that they would re-release Mobile Suit Gundam with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub. Only one episode out of the 43 episode will not be dubbed, at the request of  |Yoshiyuki_Tomino|Yoshiyuki_Tomino| . Bandai released Gundam in two sets in the summer of 2011.  The first set was released on September 13, 2011.      Following the closure in 2012 of Bandai Entertainment, the series has been out of print. At their  |New_York_Comic-Con|New_York_Comic-Con|  2014 panel, Sunrise announced their plans to re-release all of the Gundam series on home video in North America, starting with the original series. They will be distributed via  |Right_Stuf_Inc.|Right_Stuf_Inc.| .  They will release the series on Blu-ray and DVD in October 2015.      On July 25, 2015, UK anime distributor Anime Limited announced they will release Mobile Suit Gundam in cooperation with Sunrise for the first time in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray.     In both American TV showings and on the international DVD and Blu-ray release, episode 15 was cut out. According to Yoshiyuki Tomino, the removal was made at his request, with the episode becoming a lost episode of sorts, never being dubbed.  The episode remained on the Japanese DVD and Blu-ray releases.       In 1979, before the end of the anime, Yoshiyuki Tomino himself created the first novelizations of the original Gundam anime series. The novels, issued as a series of three books, allowed him to depict his story in a more sophisticated, adult, and detailed fashion. Along with this adaptation came several major changes to the story. For example, Amuro is already a member of the Federation military at the time of the initial Zeon attack on Side 7, and the main characters in the Federation serve on the White Base-class ships Pegasus and Pegasus II rather than the Pegasus-class White Base.  Additionally, the war continues well into the year UC 0080 in the novels, whereas it concludes at the beginning of that year in the anime series. In the novel Amuro Ray is killed in the final attack against the Zeonic stronghold of A Baoa Qu when his RX-78-3 is pierced through the torso by a Rick Doms beam bazooka. This occurs as Chars unit attempts to warn him about Gihrens intention to destroy the fortress and take the Federations offensive fleet along with it. Char and the crew of Pegasus II , along with handpicked men under Kycilia Zabis command, make a deep penetrating attack against the Side 3 and together kill Gihren Zabi, after which Kycilia is killed by Char. Tomino later lamented that had he known that anime ending would be different and that another series would be made, he would not have killed off Amuro in the novels.     The three novels were translated into English by  |Frederik_Schodt|Frederik_Schodt|  and published by Del Rey Books in September 1990. At the time, there were no officially recognized romanizations of character and mecha names, and a variety of different spellings were being used in the English-language fan community. In the original three novels, therefore, Mr. Schodt wrote the name Char as Sha. Sha is a transliteration of the Japanese pronunciation, although Mr. Tomino later publicly confirmed at Anime Expo New York 2002 that the name was originally based on the French name  |Charles_Aznavour|Charles_Aznavour| , a popular French-language singer. He also rendered Zaku as Zak, and Jion as Zeon, instead of Zion, which was in use in some circles. Some North American fans, already attached to particular spellings, took great umbrage at Schodts renditions, forgetting that in the original Japanese most character and mecha names are written in  katakana , and that there were, therefore, no official spellings. Many years later, when the Gundam series was finally licensed in North America, the rights holders came up with a unified list of official spellings for English-language material, and some of these spellings include Schodts renditions, as well as the renditions to which certain North American fans were attached.     In 2004, Frederik Schodt revised his original translation of the books, which had been out of print for nearly a decade. What had been a three volume set in the 1990 Del Rey edition was re-released by Stone Bridge Press as one single volume of 476 pages , titled Mobile Suit Gundam: Awakening, Escalation, Confrontation. Since the rights holders in Japan by this time had created a unified list of romanized character and mecha names, Schodt was able to use it, and Amuros rival in the novel thus became Char and not Sha ; the popular Zeon Mobile Suit, similarly, became Zaku, and not Zak .        Following the success of the Mobile Suit Gundam TV series, in 1981 Tomino reworked the footage into three separate compilation movies. The first two movies, Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam: Soldiers of Sorrow, were released in 1981. The third movie, Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space, was released in 1982.     Each of the three movies is largely composed of old footage from the TV series, however Tomino felt that some things could be changed for the better. Tomino removed several aspects of the show which he felt were still too super robot-esque for the real robot series he intended Gundam to be, such as the Gundam Hammer weapon. The G-Armor upgrade parts were also completely removed and replaced in the narrative by the more realistic Core Booster support fighters, and Hayato receives a RX-77 Guncannon at Jaburo to replace the disadvantaged RX-75 Guntank. The third movie also includes a substantial amount of new footage expanding on the battles of Solomon and A Baoa Qu.     The first Gundam film, upon release on 22 February 1981, drew a large crowd of 15,000 people at its premiere, leading to concerns from police and media that it could lead to social unrest from a riotous crowd. The event is considered a turning point in the  |history_of_anime|History_Of_Anime| , referred to as the day that anime changed according to  Asahi Shimbun  newspaper.  The first film grossed , and Gundam II grossed .  Mobile Suit Gundam III: Encounters in Space was 1982s fourth  |highest-grossing_Japanese_film|List_Of_Highest-Grossing_Films_In_Japan| , with a  |distribution_income|Gross_Rental|  of   and a total box office gross of .  Collectively, the trilogy grossed  at the Japanese box office.     In 1998, the three compilation movies were first released directly to VHS subtitled into English as part of Bandais AnimeVillage releases, which makes them among the first Gundam works released in English. The movies were released again in North America on May 7, 2002 in DVD format, available separately or in a boxed set. These are also available only with re-done Japanese audio with English subtitles, the DVDs identical to the 20th anniversary release of the movie compilation in Japan. The original Japanese voice cast members rerecorded their lines with the exception of those who were deceased. The 20th anniversary release was digitally remastered and many of the sound effects were replaced, most notably the futuristic gun sounds being replaced by louder machine gun sound effects. Also, the music soundtrack, while not remixed was rearranged and in some cases removed from some scenes. The vocal songs are rearranged also, especially in the closing credits of the second and third movies.      |Bandai_Visual|Bandai_Visual|  has announced the re-release of the Mobile Suit Gundam movies on DVD from new HD masters and with the original, theatrical, mono audio mix. This boxed set was released in Japan on December 21, 2007.   On May 18, 2010, Bandai Entertainment re-released the 20th anniversary version of the trilogy under their Anime Legends label.

It was released on March, 27th 2017, in Japanese with English subtitles only.       There have been two manga series based on Mobile Suit Gundam.

However, the staff was able to negotiate a one-month extension to end the series with 43 episodes.

With the introduction of their line of Gundam  |models|Gunpla| , the popularity of the show began to soar.

Despite being released in 1979, the original Gundam series is still remembered and recognized within the  |anime_fan_community|Otaku| . The series revolutionized  |mecha|Mecha|  anime,  introducing the new Real Robot genre, and over the years became synonymous with the entire genre for many. As a result, for example,  |parodies|Parodies|  of mecha genre commonly feature  |homages|Homage|  to Mobile Suit Gundam, thanks to its immediate recognizability.      The series was the first winner of the  Animage  Anime Grand Prix prize, in 1979 and the first half of 1980. In the top 100 anime from Animage, Gundam was twenty-fourth.

Most of the series critical response has been owed to the setting and characters.  |John_Oppliger|John_Oppliger|  observes that the characters of  |Amuro_Ray|Amuro_Ray| , to whom the young Japanese of that time could easily relate, and  |Char_Aznable|Char_Aznable| , who was simply fascinating , made a major contribution to the series popularity. He also concludes that in many respects First Gundam stands for the nostalgic identifying values of everything that anime itself represents . The series has been praised by  |Anime_News_Network|Anime_News_Network|  for the way it portrays war with Amuro facing traumatic moments as a result of killing enemy soldiers in his becoming of a soldier.   The series is also notable for having humans from a different race as antagonists rather than evil creatures.
