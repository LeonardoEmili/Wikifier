Modes of  |transport|Transport|  in  |Gabon|Gabon|  include  |rail|Rail_Transport| ,  |road|Road_Transport| ,  |water|Water_Transport| , and  |air|Air_Transport| . The one rail link, the  |Trans-Gabon_Railway|Trans-Gabon_Railway| , connects the port of  |Owendo|Owendo|  with the inland town of  |Franceville|Franceville| . Most but not all of the country is connected to the road network, much of which is unpaved, and which centres on seven national routes identified as N1 to N7. The largest  |seaports|Seaport|  are  |Port-Gentil|Port-Gentil|  and the newer Owendo, and 1,600  km of inland waterways are  |navigable|Navigability| . There are three international  |airports|Airport| , eight other paved airports, and over 40 with unpaved runways. Nearly 300  km of  |pipelines|Pipeline_Transport|  carry  |petroleum|Petroleum|  products, mainly crude oil.          Until the 1970s, Gabon had no railroads. A 936  km railroad construction program, the  |Trans-Gabon_Railway|Trans-Gabon_Railway| , began in October 1974. In its first stage, completed in 1983, the project linked the port of  |Owendo|Owendo|  with the interior city of  |Booué|Booué|  . The second stage, completed in December 1986, linked Booué with  |Franceville|Franceville|  via  |Moanda|Moanda| , thus facilitating exports of  |manganese|Manganese|  from the southeast and forestry exploitation in the same region. A proposed third stage would continue the line from Booué to  |Belinga|Belinga|  in the northeast, where there are  |iron_ore|Iron_Ore|  deposits.     In 2003, the railway began the process of installing a satellite based telecommunications system.  As of 2004, Gabon State Railways totalled 814  km of standard-gauge track.     total: 814  km  standard gauge: 814  km 1.435-m gauge; single track                      ; Existing    |Libreville|Libreville|  - capital    |Owendo|Owendo|  - port    |Sahoué|Sahoué|  - port    |Franceville|Franceville|  -  |railhead|Railhead| |Ndjolé|Ndjolé| |Lopé|Lopé| |Booué|Booué|  - likely junction for branchline to  |Makokou|Makokou| |Lastoursville|Lastoursville| |Moanda|Moanda| |Ntoum|Ntoum|  - proposed junction for iron ore traffic to  |Santa_Clara|Santa_Clara,_Gabon| |Kango|Kango| |Four-Place|Four-Place| |Mounana|Mounana|  - ?     ;Proposed    |Makokou|Makokou|  - iron ore    |Cape_Santa_Clara|Santa_Clara,_Gabon|  - proposed  |deep_water_port|List_Of_Deep_Water_Ports|  for  |Makokou|Makokou|  iron ore.    |Bélinga|Bélinga|  - possible iron ore mine.

In 2002, the road network comprised 8,454  km, of which 838  km   were paved, including 30  km of expressways. A north-south road runs the length of the country, from  |Bitam|Bitam|  to  |Ndendé|Ndendé| . This main north-south link continues into  |Cameroon|Cameroon|  in the north and the Congo in the south. An east–west road connects Libreville and Mékambo. Farther south, another road runs from  |Mayumba|Mayumba|  to  |Lastoursville|Lastoursville|  and Franceville. In 1995 there were about 23,000 automobiles and 10,000 commercial vehicles in use.     total:   7,670  km   paved:   629  km   unpaved:   7,041  km     Roads in Gabon link most areas of the country, and many of the main roads are of a reasonable standard. However, remoter areas along the coast and in the east are often not connected to the road network. Major roads are denoted national routes and numbered, with a prefix N :      |N1_road|N1_Road| |Libreville|Libreville|  –  |Kougouleu|Kougouleu|  –  |Bifoun|Bifoun|  –  |Lambaréné|Lambaréné|  –  |Mouila|Mouila|  –  |Ndendé|Ndendé|  –  |Tchibanga|Tchibanga|  -     |N2_road|N2_Road| |Bifoun|Bifoun|  –  |Alembe|Alembe|  –  |Viate|Viate|  –  |Mitzic|Mitzic|  –  |Bibasse|Bibasse|  –  |Oyem|Oyem|  –  |Bitam|Bitam|  –  |Éboro|Éboro|  –     |N3_road|N3_Road| |Alembe|Alembe|  –  |Kazamabika|Kazamabika|  –  |Lastoursville|Lastoursville|  –  |Moanda|Moanda|  –  |Franceville|Franceville| |N4_road|N4_Road| |Viate|Viate|  –  |Ekonlong|Ekonlong|  –  |Makokou|Makokou|  –  |Mékambo|Mékambo| |N5_road|N5_Road| |Kougouleu|Kougouleu|  –  |Bibasse|Bibasse| |N6_road|N6_Road| |Mayumba|Mayumba|  –  |Tchibanga|Tchibanga|  –  |Ndendé|Ndendé|  –  |Lebamba|Lebamba|  -  |Koulamoutou|Koulamoutou|  –  |Lastoursville|Lastoursville| |N7_road|N7_Road| |Makokou|Makokou|  –  |Bakwaka|Bakwaka|  –  |Okondja|Okondja|  –  |Lékori|Lékori|  -  |Akiéni|Akiéni|  –  |Ngouoni|Ngouoni|  –  |Franceville|Franceville|          The busiest ports are  |Port-Gentil|Port-Gentil| , the center for exports of petroleum products and imports of mining equipment, and  |Owendo|Owendo| , a new port that opened in 1974 on the  |Ogooué_estuary|Ogooué_Estuary| , 10  km north of Libreville. Owendos capacity, initially 300,000 tons, reached 1.5 million tons in 1979, when the port was enlarged to include timber-handling facilities. The smaller port at Mayumba also handles timber, and a deepwater port is planned for the city.       As of 2002, there was one merchant marine vessel, with a gross tonnage of 2,419/.       Gabon has 1,600  km of perennially navigable waterways, including 310  km on the  |Ogooué_River|Ogooué_River| .       Gabon had an estimated 56 airports in 2004, but only 11 of which had paved runways as of 2005. There are three international airports:  |Libreville|Libreville_International_Airport| ,  |Port-Gentil|Port-Gentil_International_Airport| , and  |Franceville|Mvengue_El_Hadj_Omar_Bongo_Ondimba_International_Airport| . Numerous airlines provide international flights.  |Nouvelle_Air_Affaires_Gabon|Nouvelle_Air_Affaires_Gabon|  handles scheduled domestic service. In 2003, about 386,000 passengers were carried on scheduled domestic and international airline flights.       total:   11   over 3,047 m:   1   2,438 to 3,047 m:   1   1,524 to 2,437 m:   8   914 to 1,523 m:   1       total:   45   1,524 to 2,437 m:   9   914 to 1,523 m:   16   under 914 m:.
