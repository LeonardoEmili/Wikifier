     Radiation therapy or radiotherapy, often abbreviated RT, RTx, or XRT, is  |therapy|Therapy|  using  |ionizing_radiation|Ionizing_Radiation| , generally as part of  |cancer_treatment|Oncology|  to control or kill  |malignant|Malignancy| |cells|Cell|  and normally delivered by a  |linear_accelerator|Linear_Particle_Accelerator| . Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of  |adjuvant_therapy|Adjuvant_Therapy| , to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor . Radiation therapy is synergistic with  |chemotherapy|Chemotherapy| , and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology.     Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the  |DNA|Dna|  of cancerous tissue leading to  |cellular_death|Mitotic_Catastrophe| . To spare normal tissues , shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger  |absorbed_dose|Absorbed_Dose|  there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumour itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.     Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from  |radiology|Radiology| , the use of radiation in  |medical_imaging|Medical_Imaging|  and  |diagnosis|Medical_Diagnosis| . Radiation may be prescribed by a  |radiation_oncologist|Radiation_Oncologist|  with intent to cure or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as  |palliative_treatment|Palliative_Care|  or as therapeutic treatment . It is also common to combine radiation therapy with  |surgery|Surgery| , chemotherapy,  |hormone_therapy|Hormonal_Therapy| ,  |immunotherapy|Immunotherapy|  or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.     The precise treatment intent  will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient.  |Total_body_irradiation|Total_Body_Irradiation|  is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a  |bone_marrow_transplant|Bone_Marrow_Transplant| .  |Brachytherapy|Brachytherapy| , in which a  |radioactive_source|Radioactive_Source|  is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of  |trigeminal_neuralgia|Trigeminal_Neuralgia| ,  |acoustic_neuromas|Vestibular_Schwannoma| , severe  |thyroid_eye_disease|Graves_Ophthalmopathy| ,  |pterygium|Pterygium| ,  |pigmented_villonodular_synovitis|Pigmented_Villonodular_Synovitis| , and prevention of  |keloid|Keloid|  scar growth, vascular  |restenosis|Restenosis| , and  |heterotopic_ossification|Heterotopic_Ossification| . The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.             Different cancers respond to radiation therapy in different ways. CK Bomford, IH Kunkler, J Walter. Walter and Miller’s Textbook of Radiation therapy , p311 Radiosensitivity on GP notebook  Radiation therapy- what GPs need to know on patient.co.uk      The response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.   Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include  |leukemias|Leukemias| , most  |lymphomas|Lymphomas|  and  |germ_cell_tumors|Germ_Cell_Tumors| .   The majority of  |epithelial_cancers|Epithelial_Cancers|  are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation to achieve a radical cure.   Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice.  |Renal_cell_cancer|Renal_Cell_Cancer|  and  |melanoma|Melanoma|  are generally considered to be radioresistant but radiation therapy is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma. Combining radiation therapy with  |immunotherapy|Immunotherapy|  is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.      It is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation curability of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localised to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example:  |non-melanoma_skin_cancer|Skin_Neoplasm| ,  |head_and_neck_cancer|Head_And_Neck_Cancer| ,  |breast_cancer|Breast_Cancer| ,  |non-small_cell_lung_cancer|Non-Small_Cell_Lung_Cancer| ,  |cervical_cancer|Cervical_Cancer| ,  |anal_cancer|Anal_Cancer| , and  |prostate_cancer|Prostate_Cancer| .  |Metastatic|Metastatic|  cancers are generally incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.     Before treatment, a CT scan is often performed to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields. Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC.  in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ . 11 ed. 2008. Patient positioning is crucial at this stage as the patient will have to be set-up in the identical position during treatment. Many patient positioning devices have been developed for this purpose, including masks and cushions which can be molded to the patient.     The response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size. Due to complex  |radiobiology|Radiobiology| , very large tumors respond less well to radiation than smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with  |wide_local_excision|Wide_Local_Excision|  or  |mastectomy|Mastectomy|  followed by  |adjuvant_radiation_therapy|Adjuvant_Radiation_Therapy| . Another method is to shrink the tumor with  |neoadjuvant|Neoadjuvant|  chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include:  |Cisplatin|Cisplatin| ,  |Nimorazole|Nimorazole| , and  |Cetuximab|Cetuximab| .     The impact of radiotherapy varies between different types of cancer and different groups.  For example, for breast cancer after  |breast-conserving_surgery|Breast-Conserving_Surgery| , radiotherapy has been found to halve the rate at which the disease recurs.        Radiation therapy is in itself painless. Many low-dose  |palliative_treatments|Palliative_Care|   cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced in the days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment , in the months or years following treatment , or after re-treatment . The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself , and the patient.     Most side effects are predictable and expected. Side effects from radiation are usually limited to the area of the patients body that is under treatment. Side effects are dose- dependent; for example higher doses of head and neck radiation can be associated with  |cardiovascular|Cardiovascular|  complications,  |thyroid|Thyroid|  dysfunction, and  |pituitary|Pituitary|  axis dysfunction.  Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.     The main side effects reported are fatigue and skin irritation, like a mild to moderate sun burn. The fatigue often sets in during the middle of a course of treatment and can last for weeks after treatment ends. The irritated skin will heal, but may not be as elastic as it was before.        ; Nausea and vomiting   :This is not a general side effect of radiation therapy, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen , or with radiation therapy to certain nausea-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the  |vestibules_of_the_inner_ears|Vestibule_Of_The_Ear| .  As with any distressing treatment, some patients vomit immediately during radiotherapy, or even in anticipation of it, but this is considered a psychological response. Nausea for any reason can be treated with antiemetics.  Common radiation side effects   ; Damage to the  |epithelial|Epithelium|  surfaces    :Epithelial surfaces may sustain damage from radiation therapy. Depending on the area being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this  |moist_desquamation|Moist_Desquamation|  is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.   ; Mouth, throat and stomach sores   :If the head and neck area is treated, temporary soreness and ulceration commonly occur in the mouth and throat.  If severe, this can affect swallowing, and the patient may need painkillers and nutritional support/food supplements. The esophagus can also become sore if it is treated directly, or if, as commonly occurs, it receives a dose of collateral radiation during treatment of lung cancer. When treating liver malignancies and metastases, it is possible for collateral radiation to cause gastric, stomach or duodenal ulcers   This collateral radiation is commonly caused by non-targeted delivery of the radioactive agents being infused.  Methods, techniques and devices are available to lower the occurrence of this type of adverse side effect.    ; Intestinal discomfort   :The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures . Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea.   ; Swelling   :As part of the general  |inflammation|Inflammation|  that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during radiation therapy. This is a concern during treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases, especially where there is pre-existing raised  |intracranial_pressure|Intracranial_Pressure|  or where the tumor is causing near-total obstruction of a  |lumen|Lumen|  . Surgical intervention may be considered prior to treatment with radiation. If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive  |steroids|Steroids|  during radiation therapy to reduce swelling.   ; Infertility   :The  |gonads|Gonads|  are very sensitive to radiation. They may be unable to produce  |gametes|Gametes|  following direct exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment.       Late side effects occur months to years after treatment and are generally limited to the area that has been treated. They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.     ;  |Fibrosis|Fibrosis|    : Tissues which have been irradiated tend to become less elastic over time due to a diffuse scarring process.   ; Epilation   : Epilation may occur on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1  Gy. It only occurs within the radiation field/s. Hair loss may be permanent with a single dose of 10  Gy, but if the dose is fractionated permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45  Gy.   ; Dryness   : The salivary glands and tear glands have a radiation tolerance of about 30   |Gy|Gray|  in 2  Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical head and neck cancer treatments. Dry mouth  and dry eyes  can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patients  |quality_of_life|Quality_Of_Life| . Similarly,  |sweat_glands|Sweat_Gland|  in treated skin  tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal  |mucosa|Mucosa|  is often dry following pelvic irradiation.   ;  |Lymphedema|Lymphedema|    : Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during radiation therapy. It is the most commonly reported complication in breast radiation therapy patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .    ; Cancer   : Radiation is a potential cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen in some patients. Cancer survivors are already more likely than the general population to develop malignancies due to a number of factors including lifestyle choices, genetics, and previous radiation treatment. It is difficult to directly quantify the rates of these secondary cancers from any single cause. Studies have found radiation therapy as the cause of secondary malignancies for only a small minority of patients.   Techniques such as IMRT and VMAT which aim to reduce dose to healthy tissues will lower these risks.  It usually occurs 20 – 30 years following treatment, although some haematological malignancies may develop within 5 – 10 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer.   ;  |Cardiovascular_disease|Cardiovascular_Disease|    : Radiation can increase the risk of heart disease and death as observed in previous breast cancer RT regimens.  Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event by 1.5 to 4 times a persons normal rate, aggravating factors included.  The increase is dose dependent, related to the RTs dose strength, volume and location.   : Cardiovascular late side effects have been termed radiation-induced heart disease and radiation-induced vascular disease .  Symptoms are dose dependent and include  |cardiomyopathy|Cardiomyopathy| ,  |myocardial_fibrosis|Myocardial_Fibrosis| ,  |valvular_heart_disease|Valvular_Heart_Disease| ,  |coronary_artery_disease|Coronary_Artery_Disease| ,  |heart_arrhythmia|Heart_Arrhythmia|  and  |peripheral_artery_disease|Peripheral_Artery_Disease| . Radiation-induced fibrosis, vascular  |cell_damage|Endothelial_Dysfunction|  and  |oxidative_stress|Oxidative_Stress|  can lead to these and other late side effect symptoms. Most radiation-induced cardiovascular diseases occur 10 or more years post treatment, making causality determinations more difficult.   ; Cognitive decline   : In cases of radiation applied to the head radiation therapy may cause  |cognitive_decline|Radiation_Induced_Cognitive_Decline| . Cognitive decline was especially apparent in young children, between the ages of 5 to 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5-year-old children declined each year after treatment by several IQ points.    ;  |Radiation_enteropathy|Radiation_Enteropathy|    : The gastrointestinal tract can be damaged following abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy.  Atrophy, fibrosis and vascular changes produce  |malabsorption|Malabsorption| ,  |diarrhea|Diarrhea| ,  |steatorrhea|Steatorrhea|  and  |bleeding|Gastrointestinal_Bleeding|  with  |bile_acid_diarrhea|Bile_Acid_Diarrhea|  and  |vitamin_B12|Vitamin_B12|  malabsorption commonly found due to ileal involvement.  |Pelvic_radiation_disease|Pelvic_Radiation_Disease|  includes  |radiation_proctitis|Radiation_Proctitis| , producing bleeding, diarrhoea and urgency,  and can also cause radiation cystitis when the bladder is affected.   ; Radiation-induced  |polyneuropathy|Peripheral_Neuropathy|    : Radiation treatments are vitally necessary but may damage nerves near the target area or within the delivery path as nerve tissue is also  |radiosensitive|Radiosensitivity| .  Nerve damage from ionizing radiation occurs in phases, the initial phase from microvascular injury, capillary damage and  |nerve_demyelination|Demyelinating_Disease| .   Subsequent damage occurs from vascular constriction and  |nerve_compression|Nerve_Compression_Syndrome|  due to  |uncontrolled_fibrous_tissue_growth|Fibrosis|  caused by radiation. Radiation-induced polyneuropathy, , occurs in approximately 1-5% of those receiving radiation therapy.   : Depending upon the irradiated zone, late effect neuropathy may occur in either the  |central_nervous_system|Central_Nervous_System|  or the  |peripheral_nervous_system|Peripheral_Nervous_System| . In the CNS for example, cranial nerve injury typically presents as a visual acuity loss 1-14 years post treatment. In the PNS, injury to the plexus nerves presents as radiation-induced brachial plexopathy or  |radiation-induced_lumbosacral_plexopathy|Radiation-Induced_Lumbar_Plexopathy|  appearing up to 3 decades post treatment.       Cumulative effects from this process should not be confused with long-term effects—when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic.  These doses are calculated by the radiation oncologist and many factors are taken into account before the subsequent radiation takes place.       During the first two weeks after  |fertilization|Fertilization| , radiation therapy is lethal but not  |teratogenic|Teratogenic| .   High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce  |anomalies|Congenital_Anomaly| ,  |impaired_growth|Intrauterine_Growth_Restriction|  and  |intellectual_disability|Intellectual_Disability| , and there may be an increased risk of  |childhood_leukemia|Childhood_Leukemia|  and other tumours in the offspring.     In males previously having undergone radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy. However, the use of  |assisted_reproductive_technologies|Assisted_Reproductive_Technologies|  and  |micromanipulation_techniques|Micromanipulation_Technique|  might increase this risk.        |Hypopituitarism|Hypopituitarism|  commonly develops after radiation therapy for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, head and neck tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies. Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects  |growth_hormone|Growth_Hormone|  and  |gonadal_hormones|Gonadal_Hormone| .  In contrast,  |adrenocorticotrophic_hormone|Adrenocorticotrophic_Hormone|  and  |thyroid_stimulating_hormone|Thyroid_Stimulating_Hormone|  deficiencies are the least common among people with radiation-induced hypopituitarism. Changes in  |prolactin|Prolactin| -secretion is usually mild, and vasopressin deficiency appears to be very rare as a consequence of radiation.       There are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine  |Therac-25|Therac-25|  was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in  |Missouri|Missouri|  overexposed 76 patients during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly.      Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. ASTRO has launched a safety initiative called  that, among other things, aims to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from happening. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients to ask their doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.             Radiation therapy is used to treat early stage  |Dupuytrens_disease|Dupuytrens_Contracture|  and  |Ledderhose_disease|Plantar_Fibromatosis| . When Dupuytrens disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then radiation therapy is used to prevent further progress of the disease. Radiation therapy is also used post surgery in some cases to prevent the disease continuing to progress. Low doses of radiation are used typically three gray of radiation for five days, with a break of three months followed by another phase of three gray of radiation for five days.            Radiation therapy works by damaging the  |DNA|Dna|  of cancerous cells. This DNA damage is caused by one of two types of energy,  |photon|Photon|  or  |charged_particle|Charged_Particle| . This damage is either direct or indirect  |ionization|Ionization|  of the atoms which make up the DNA chain. Indirect  |ionization|Ionization|  happens as a result of the ionization of water, forming  |free_radicals|Radical| , notably  |hydroxyl|Hydroxyl|  radicals, which then damage the DNA.     In photon therapy, most of the radiation effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage and  |double-stranded_DNA|Double-Stranded_Dna|  damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are much more difficult to repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo  |cell_death|Apoptosis| . Cancer cells are generally less  |differentiated|Cellular_Differentiation|  and more  |stem_cell|Stem_Cell| -like; they reproduce more than most healthy  |differentiated|Cellular_Differentiation|  cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.     One of the major limitations of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in  |oxygen|Oxygen| . Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as  |hypoxia|Hypoxia| . Oxygen is a potent  |radiosensitizer|Radiosensitizer| , increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment.    Much research has been devoted to overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks,  |hyperthermia_therapy|Hyperthermia_Therapy|  , blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as  |misonidazole|Misonidazole|  and  |metronidazole|Metronidazole| , and hypoxic  |cytotoxins|Cytotoxins|  , such as  |tirapazamine|Tirapazamine| . Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an  |oxygen_diffusion-enhancing_compound|Oxygen_Diffusion-Enhancing_Compound|  such as  |trans_sodium_crocetinate|Trans_Sodium_Crocetinate|  as a  |radiosensitizer|Radiosensitizer| .      Charged particles such as  |protons|Proton|  and  |boron|Boron| ,  |carbon|Carbon| , and  |neon|Neon|  ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET  and have an antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the  |Bragg_peak|Bragg_Peak|  effect. See  |proton_therapy|Proton_Therapy|  for a good example of the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy vs.  |charged_particle_therapy|Charged_Particle_Therapy| . This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRTs use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. Curtis RE, Freedman DM, Ron E, Ries LAG, Hacker DG, Edwards BK, Tucker MA, Fraumeni JF Jr. . New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973–2000. National Cancer Institute. NIH Publ. No. 05-5302. Bethesda, MD, 2006. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging .   This x-ray exposure is especially bad for children, due to their growing bodies, and they have a 30% chance of a second malignancy after 5 years post initial RT.        The amount of radiation used in photon radiation therapy is measured in  |grays|Gray|  , and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80  Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40  Gy.     Preventive doses are typically around 45–60  Gy in 1.8–2  Gy fractions Many other factors are considered by  |radiation_oncologists|Radiation_Oncologist|  when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether radiation therapy is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery.     Delivery parameters of a prescribed dose are determined during  |treatment_planning|Treatment_Planning|  . Treatment planning is generally performed on dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software. Depending on the radiation delivery method, several angles or sources may be used to sum to the total necessary dose. The planner will try to design a plan that delivers a uniform prescription dose to the tumor and minimizes dose to surrounding healthy tissues.     In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions may be evaluated using the  |dosimetry|Dosimetry|  technique known as  |gel_dosimetry|Gel_Dosimetry| .      ;Fractionation      The total dose is fractionated for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells that were in a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.      Fractionation regimens are individualised between different radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2  Gy per day, five days a week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within a certain amount of time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8  Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.     In some cases, two fractions per day are used near the end of a course of treatment. This schedule, known as a concomitant boost regimen or hyperfractionation, is used on tumors that regenerate more quickly when they are smaller. In particular, tumors in the head-and-neck demonstrate this behavior.     Patients receiving  |palliative_radiation|Palliative_Radiation|  to treat uncomplicated painful bone metastasis should not receive more than a single fraction of radiation. , which cites    A single treatment gives comparable pain relief and morbidity outcomes to multiple-fraction treatments, and for patients with limited life expectancy, a single treatment is best to improve patient comfort.     ;Schedules for fractionation   One fractionation schedule that is increasingly being used and continues to be studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2  Gy/fraction to 20  Gy/fraction, the latter being typical of stereotactic treatments for subcranial lesions, or SRS for intracranial lesions. The rationale of hypofractionation is to reduce the probability of local recurrence by denying clonogenic cells the time they require to reproduce and also to exploit the radiosensitivity of some tumors. In particular, stereotactic treatments are intended to destroy clonogenic cells by a process of ablation – i.e. the delivery of a dose intended to destroy clonogenic cells directly, rather than to interrupt the process of clonogenic cell division repeatedly , as in routine radiotherapy.       Different cancer types have different radiation sensitivity. However, predicting the sensitivity based on genomic or proteomic analyses of biopsy samples has proved difficult.   An alternative approach to genomics and proteomics was offered by the discovery that radiation protection in microbes is offered by non-enzymatic complexes of  |manganese|Manganese|  and small organic metabolites.  The content and variation of manganese were found to be good predictors of  |radiosensitivity|Radiosensitivity| , and this finding extends also to human cells.  An association was confirmed between total cellular manganese contents and their variation, and clinically-inferred radioresponsiveness in different tumor cells, a finding that may be useful for more precise radiodosages and improved treatment of cancer patients.        Historically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are :    |external_beam_radiation_therapy|External_Beam_Radiation_Therapy|  or teletherapy;   brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy; and   systemic radioisotope therapy or  |unsealed_source_radiotherapy|Unsealed_Source_Radiotherapy| .   The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel.      |Particle_therapy|Particle_Therapy|  is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are  |protons|Proton|  or heavier  |ions|Ions| .              The following three sections refer to treatment using x-rays.          Historically conventional external beam radiation therapy was delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical linear accelerators which generate high energy x-rays.   2DXRT mainly consists of a single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides.     Conventional refers to the way the treatment is planned or simulated on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions , and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired plan. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume.     An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning to such an extent that tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy has become the standard treatment for almost all tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.               Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.     There are two types of stereotactic radiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. Stereotactic body radiation therapy refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.      Some doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.     Stereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse,  |Cyberknife|Cyberknife| ,  |Gamma_Knife|Gamma_Knife| , Novalis, Primatom, Synergy,  |X-Knife|X-Knife| ,  |TomoTherapy|Tomotherapy| , Trilogy and  |Truebeam|Truebeam| .  This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.         The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.      Virtual simulation, the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.     An enhancement of virtual simulation is 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy , in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a  |beams_eye_view|Beams_Eye_View|  using a  |multileaf_collimator|Multileaf_Collimator|  and a variable number of beams.  When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.          Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT.  IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes, for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel.  Computer-controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform  |optimization|Optimization|  and treatment simulation . The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beams intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissues is decreased or avoided completely. This results in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.     3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast, and lung. Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency programs must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.     Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers in a series of pivotal trials performed by Professor  |Christopher_Nutting|Christopher_Nutting|  of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT,  about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans or that move between or during a treatment . New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty—for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called  |image-guided_radiation_therapy|Image-Guided_Radiation_Therapy|  or four-dimensional radiation therapy.     Another technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location.  The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.       A well-studied issue with IRMT is the tongue and groove effect which results in unwanted underdosing, due to irradiating through extended tongues and grooves of overlapping MLC leaves.  While solutions to this issue have been developed, which either reduce the TG effect to negligible amounts or remove it completely, they depend upon the method of IMRT being used and some of them carry costs of their own. Some texts distinguish tongue and groove error from tongue or groove error , according as both or one side of the aperture is occluded.        Volumetric modulated arc therapy is a radiation technique introduced in 2007  which can achieve highly conformal dose distributions on target volume coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry , changing speed and shape of the beam with a  |multileaf_collimator|Multileaf_Collimator|  and fluence output rate of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT has an advantage in patient treatment, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy , of reduced radiation delivery times.   Comparisons between VMAT and conventional IMRT for their sparing of healthy tissues and Organs at Risk depends upon the cancer type. In the treatment of  |nasopharyngeal|Nasopharynx_Cancer| ,  |oropharyngeal|Oropharyngeal_Cancer|  and  |hypopharyngeal|Hypopharyngeal_Cancer|  carcinomas VMAT provides equivalent or better OAR protection. In the treatment of  |prostate_cancer|Prostate_Cancer|  the OAR protection result is mixed with some studies favoring VMAT, others favoring IMRT.               In particle therapy , energetic ionizing particles are directed at the target tumor.  The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum  that occurs near the end of the particles  |range|Range| , and it then drops to zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.               |Auger_therapy|Auger_Therapy|  makes use of a very high dose  of ionizing radiation in situ that provides molecular modifications at an atomic scale. AT differs from conventional radiation therapy in several aspects; it neither relies upon radioactive nuclei to cause cellular radiation damage at a cellular dimension, nor engages multiple external pencil-beams from different directions to zero-in to deliver a dose to the targeted area with reduced dose outside the targeted tissue/organ locations. Instead, the in situ delivery of a very high dose at the molecular level using AT aims for in situ molecular modifications involving molecular breakages and molecular re-arrangements such as a change of stacking structures as well as cellular metabolic functions related to the said molecule structures.       Contact x-ray brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy using kilovoltage  |X-rays|X-Ray|  applied close to the tumour to treat  |rectal_cancer|Rectal_Cancer| . The process involves inserting the  |x-ray_tube|X-Ray_Tube|  through the  |anus|Anus|  into the rectum and placing it against the cancerous tissue, then high doses of X-rays are emitted directly into the  |tumor|Tumor_Cells|  at two weekly intervals. It is typically used for treating early rectal cancer in patients who may not be candidates for surgery.    A 2015 NICE review found the main side effect to be bleeding that occurred in about 38% of cases, and radiation-induced ulcer which occurred in 27% of cases.               Brachytherapy is delivered by placing radiation source inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical,    prostate,    breast,    and skin cancer    and can also be used to treat tumours in many other body sites.        In brachytherapy, radiation sources are precisely placed directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.    A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.     As one example of the localized nature of breast brachytherapy, the SAVI device delivers the radiation dose through multiple catheters, each of which can be individually controlled. This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam radiation therapy and older methods of breast brachytherapy.           Systemic radioisotope therapy is a form of targeted therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through  |infusion|Route_Of_Administration|  or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of  |metaiodobenzylguanidine|Metaiodobenzylguanidine|  to treat  |neuroblastoma|Neuroblastoma| , of oral  |iodine-131|Iodine-131|  to treat  |thyroid_cancer|Thyroid_Cancer|  or  |thyrotoxicosis|Thyrotoxicosis| , and of hormone-bound  |lutetium-177|Lutetium-177|  and  |yttrium-90|Yttrium-90|  to treat  |neuroendocrine_tumors|Neuroendocrine_Tumors|  .     Another example is the injection of radioactive yttrium-90 or holmium-166 microspheres into the  |hepatic_artery|Hepatic_Artery_Proper|  to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases. These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as  |selective_internal_radiation_therapy|Selective_Internal_Radiation_Therapy| . The microspheres are approximately 30   |µm|Μm|  in diameter and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a  |catheter|Catheter|  up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently three different kinds of microspheres:  |SIR-Spheres|Sir-Spheres| ,  |TheraSphere|Therasphere|  and QuiremSpheres.     A major use of systemic radioisotope therapy is in the treatment of  |bone_metastasis|Bone_Metastasis|  from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used in the treatment of bone metastasis are  |radium-223|Radium-223| ,   |strontium-89|Strontium-89|  and  |samarium_lexidronam|Samarium_Lexidronam| .      In 2002, the  |United_States_Food_and_Drug_Administration|U.S._Food_And_Drug_Administration|  approved  |ibritumomab_tiuxetan|Ibritumomab_Tiuxetan|  , which is an anti- |CD20|Cd20| |monoclonal_antibody|Monoclonal_Antibody|  conjugated to yttrium-90.     In 2003, the FDA approved the  |tositumomab|Tositumomab| /iodine tositumomab regimen , which is a combination of an iodine-131 labelled and an unlabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.     These medications were the first agents of what is known as  |radioimmunotherapy|Radioimmunotherapy| , and they were approved for the treatment of refractory  |non-Hodgkins_lymphoma|Non-Hodgkins_Lymphoma| .           |Intraoperative_radiation_therapy|Intraoperative_Radiation_Therapy|  is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, such as a  |cancer|Cancerous|  tumor, while the area is exposed during  |surgery|Surgery| .        The rationale for IORT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.         |Deep_inspiration_breath-hold|Deep_Inspiration_Breath-Hold|  is a method of delivering radiotherapy while limiting radiation exposure to the heart and lungs.  It is used primarily for treating left-sided breast cancer. The technique involves a patient holding their breath during treatment. There are two basic methods of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold and spirometry-monitored deep inspiration breath hold.                Medicine has used radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of x-rays in 1895 by  |Wilhelm_Röntgen|Wilhelm_Röntgen| .   |Emil_Grubbe|Emil_Grubbe|  of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use x-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.      The field of radiation therapy began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of  |Nobel_Prize|Nobel_Prize| –winning scientist  |Marie_Curie|Marie_Curie|  , who discovered the radioactive elements  |polonium|Polonium|  and  |radium|Radium|  in 1898. This began a new era in medical treatment and research. Through the 1920s the hazards of radiation exposure were not understood, and little protection was used. Radium was believed to have wide curative powers and radiotherapy was applied to many diseases.     Prior to World War 2, the only practical sources of radiation for radiotherapy were  |radium|Radium| , its emanation ,  |radon|Radon|  gas, and the  |x-ray_tube|X-Ray_Tube| .  |External_beam_radiotherapy|External_Beam_Radiotherapy|  began at the turn of the century with relatively low voltage .
