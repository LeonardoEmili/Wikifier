                 Bioinformatics  is an  |interdisciplinary|Interdisciplinary|  field that develops methods and  |software_tools|Software_Tool|  for understanding  |biological|Biology|  data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines  |biology|Biology| ,  |computer_science|Computer_Science| ,  |information_engineering|Information_Engineering| ,  |mathematics|Mathematics|  and  |statistics|Statistics|  to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for  in silico  analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques.     Bioinformatics includes biological studies that use  |computer_programming|Computer_Programming|  as part of their methodology, as well as a specific analysis pipelines that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of  |genomics|Genomics| . Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates  |genes|Gene|  and single  |nucleotide|Nucleotide|  polymorphisms . Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties , or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within  |nucleic_acid|Nucleic_Acid|  and  |protein|Protein|  sequences, called  |proteomics|Proteomics| .        Bioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In experimental  |molecular_biology|Molecular_Biology| , bioinformatics techniques such as  |image|Image_Processing|  and  |signal_processing|Signal_Processing|  allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed  |mutations|Mutation| . It plays a role in the  |text_mining|Text_Mining|  of biological literature and the development of biological and gene  |ontologies|Ontology|  to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in comparing, analyzing and interpreting of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of  |systems_biology|Systems_Biology| . In  |structural_biology|Structural_Biology| , it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA,  RNA,  proteins  as well as biomolecular interactions.           Historically, the term bioinformatics did not mean what it means today.  |Paulien_Hogeweg|Paulien_Hogeweg|  and  |Ben_Hesper|Ben_Hesper|  coined it in 1970 to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems.    This definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to  |biochemistry|Biochemistry|  .            Computers became essential in molecular biology when  |protein_sequences|Protein_Sequences|  became available after  |Frederick_Sanger|Frederick_Sanger|  determined the sequence of  |insulin|Insulin|  in the early 1950s. Comparing multiple sequences manually turned out to be impractical. A pioneer in the field was  |Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff|Margaret_Oakley_Dayhoff| .  She compiled one of the first protein sequence databases, initially published as books Dayhoff, M.O. Atlas of protein sequence and structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, 215 pp. and pioneered methods of sequence alignment and molecular evolution.  Another early contributor to bioinformatics was  |Elvin_A._Kabat|Elvin_A._Kabat| , who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences released with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991.        To study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data. This includes nucleotide and  |amino_acid_sequences|Amino_Acid_Sequence| ,  |protein_domains|Protein_Domain| , and  |protein_structures|Protein_Structure| .  The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as  |computational_biology|Computational_Biology| . Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:     Development and implementation of computer programs that enable efficient access to, management and use of, various types of information   Development of new algorithms and statistical measures that assess relationships among members of large data sets. For example, there are methods to locate a  |gene|Gene|  within a sequence, to predict protein structure and/or function, and to  |cluster|Cluster_Analysis|  protein sequences into families of related sequences.     The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. Examples include:  |pattern_recognition|Pattern_Recognition| ,  |data_mining|Data_Mining| ,  |machine_learning|Machine_Learning|  algorithms, and  |visualization|Biological_Data_Visualization| . Major research efforts in the field include  |sequence_alignment|Sequence_Alignment| ,  |gene_finding|Gene_Finding| ,  |genome_assembly|Genome_Assembly| ,  |drug_design|Drug_Design| ,  |drug_discovery|Drug_Discovery| ,  |protein_structure_alignment|Protein_Structural_Alignment| ,  |protein_structure_prediction|Protein_Structure_Prediction| , prediction of  |gene_expression|Gene_Expression|  and  |protein–protein_interactions|Protein–Protein_Interactions| ,  |genome-wide_association_studies|Genome-Wide_Association_Studies| , the modeling of  |evolution|Evolution|  and  |cell_division/mitosis.|Cellular_Model|      Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.     Over the past few decades, rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in  |information_technologies|Information_Technologies|  have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.     Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing  |DNA|Dna|  and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.       Bioinformatics is a science field that is similar to but distinct from  |biological_computation|Biological_Computation| , while it is often considered synonymous to  |computational_biology|Computational_Biology| . Biological computation uses  |bioengineering|Bioengineering|  and  |biology|Biology|  to build biological  |computers|Computer| , whereas bioinformatics uses computation to better understand biology. Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The field of bioinformatics experienced explosive growth starting in the mid-1990s, driven largely by the  |Human_Genome_Project|Human_Genome_Project|  and by rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology.     Analyzing biological data to produce meaningful information involves writing and running software programs that use  |algorithms|Algorithm|  from  |graph_theory|Graph_Theory| ,  |artificial_intelligence|Artificial_Intelligence| ,  |soft_computing|Soft_Computing| ,  |data_mining|Data_Mining| ,  |image_processing|Image_Processing| , and  |computer_simulation|Computer_Simulation| . The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as  |discrete_mathematics|Discrete_Mathematics| ,  |control_theory|Control_Theory| ,  |system_theory|System_Theory| ,  |information_theory|Information_Theory| , and  |statistics|Statistics| .               Since the  |Phage_Φ-X174|Phi_X_174|  was  |sequenced|Sequencing|  in 1977,  the  |DNA_sequences|Dna_Sequence|  of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode  |proteins|Protein| , RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a  |species|Species|  or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species . With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today,  |computer_programs|Computer_Program|  such as  |BLAST|Blast|  are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion  |nucleotides|Nucleotide| .  These programs can compensate for mutations in the DNA sequence, to identify sequences that are related, but not identical. A variant of this  |sequence_alignment|Sequence_Alignment|  is used in the sequencing process itself. For the special task of taxonomic classification of sequence snippets, modern  |k-mer|K-Mer|  based software like Kraken achieves throughput unreachable by alignment methods.          Before sequences can be analyzed they have to be obtained from the data storage bank example the Genbank.  |DNA_sequencing|Dna_Sequencing|  is still a non-trivial problem as the raw data may be noisy or afflicted by weak signals.  |Algorithms|Algorithm|  have been developed for  |base_calling|Base_Calling|  for the various experimental approaches to DNA sequencing.          Most DNA sequencing techniques produce short fragments of sequence that need to be assembled to obtain complete gene or genome sequences. The so-called  |shotgun_sequencing|Shotgun_Sequencing|  technique   generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments . The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the  |human_genome|Human_Genome| , it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly usually contains numerous gaps that must be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.                 In the context of  |genomics|Genomics| ,  |annotation|Genome_Projectgenome_Annotation|  is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. This process needs to be automated because most genomes are too large to annotate by hand, not to mention the desire to annotate as many genomes as possible, as the rate of  |sequencing|Dna_Sequencing|  has ceased to pose a bottleneck. Annotation is made possible by the fact that genes have recognisable start and stop regions, although the exact sequence found in these regions can vary between genes.     The first description of a comprehensive genome annotation system was published in 1995 by the team at  |The_Institute_for_Genomic_Research|The_Institute_For_Genomic_Research|  that performed the first complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of a free-living organism, the bacterium  Haemophilus influenzae .  |Owen_White|Owen_White|  designed and built a software system to identify the genes encoding all proteins, transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and to make initial functional assignments. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA, such as the  |GeneMark|Genemark|  program trained and used to find protein-coding genes in  Haemophilus influenzae , are constantly changing and improving.     Following the goals that the Human Genome Project left to achieve after its closure in 2003, a new project developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute in the U.S appeared. The so-called  |ENCODE|Encode|  project is a collaborative data collection of the functional elements of the human genome that uses next-generation DNA-sequencing technologies and genomic tiling arrays, technologies able to automatically generate large amounts of data at a dramatically reduced per-base cost but with the same accuracy and fidelity .             |Evolutionary_biology|Evolutionary_Biology|  is the study of the origin and descent of  |species|Species| , as well as their change over time.  |Informatics|Informatics|  has assisted evolutionary biologists by enabling researchers to:   trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their  |DNA|Dna| , rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone,   compare entire  |genomes|Genomes| , which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as  |gene_duplication|Gene_Duplication| ,  |horizontal_gene_transfer|Horizontal_Gene_Transfer| , and the prediction of factors important in bacterial  |speciation|Speciation| ,   build complex computational  |population_genetics|Population_Genetics|  models to predict the outcome of the system over time    track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms   Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex  |tree_of_life|Evolutionary_Tree| .     The area of research within  |computer_science|Computer_Science|  that uses  |genetic_algorithms|Genetic_Algorithm|  is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary biology, but the two areas are not necessarily related.            The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between  |genes|Genes|   or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion.  Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and  |endosymbiosis|Endosymbiosis| , often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact,  |heuristics|Heuristics| , fixed parameter and  |approximation_algorithms|Approximation_Algorithms|  for problems based on parsimony models to  |Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo|Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo|  algorithms for  |Bayesian_analysis|Bayesian_Analysis|  of problems based on probabilistic models.     Many of these studies are based on the detection of  |sequence_homology|Sequence_Homology|  to assign sequences to  |protein_families|Protein_Family| .             Pan genomics is a concept introduced in 2005 by Tettelin and Medini which eventually took root in bioinformatics. Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular taxonomic group: although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum etc. It is divided in two parts- The Core genome: Set of genes common to all the genomes under study and The Dispensable/Flexible Genome: Set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study. A bioinformatics tool BPGA can be used to characterize the Pan Genome of bacterial species.             With the advent of next-generation sequencing we are obtaining enough sequence data to map the genes of complex diseases  |infertility|Infertility| ,   |breast_cancer|Breast_Cancer|   or  |Alzheimers_disease|Alzheimers_Disease| .  Genome-wide association studies are a useful approach to pinpoint the mutations responsible for such complex diseases.  Through these studies, thousands of DNA variants have been identified that are associated with similar diseases and traits.  Furthermore, the possibility for genes to be used at prognosis, diagnosis or treatment is one of the most essential applications. Many studies are discussing both the promising ways to choose the genes to be used and the problems and pitfalls of using genes to predict disease presence or prognosis.             In  |cancer|Cancer| , the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown  |point_mutations|Point_Mutation|  in a variety of  |genes|Gene|  in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of  |human_genome|Human_Genome|  sequences and  |germline|Germline|  polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as  |oligonucleotide|Oligonucleotide|  microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses , and  |single-nucleotide_polymorphism|Single-Nucleotide_Polymorphism|  arrays to detect known point mutations. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate  |terabytes|Terabyte|  of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or  |noise|Noise| , and thus  |Hidden_Markov_model|Hidden_Markov_Model|  and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real  |copy_number|Copy_Number_Variation|  changes.     Two important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the  |exome|Exome| . First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.      With the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.      Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of  |lesions|Lesion|  found to be recurrent among many tumors.           The  |expression|Gene_Expression|  of many genes can be determined by measuring  |mRNA|Messenger_Rna|  levels with multiple techniques including  |microarrays|Dna_Microarray| ,  |expressed_cDNA_sequence_tag|Expressed_Sequence_Tag|  sequencing,  |serial_analysis_of_gene_expression|Serial_Analysis_Of_Gene_Expression|  tag sequencing,  |massively_parallel_signature_sequencing|Massively_Parallel_Signature_Sequencing|  ,  |RNA-Seq|Rna-Seq| , also known as Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing , or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate  |signal|Signal|  from  |noise|Noise|  in high-throughput gene expression studies.  Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous  |epithelial|Epithelial|  cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.        |Protein_microarrays|Protein_Microarray|  and high throughput  |mass_spectrometry|Mass_Spectrometry|  can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected. Cellular protein localization in a tissue context can be achieved through affinity  |proteomics|Proteomics|  displayed as spatial data based on  |immunohistochemistry|Immunohistochemistry|  and  |tissue_microarrays|Tissue_Microarray| .         |Gene_regulation|Regulation_Of_Gene_Expression|  is the complex orchestration of events by which a signal, potentially an extracellular signal such as a  |hormone|Hormone| , eventually leads to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more  |proteins|Protein| . Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process.     For example, gene expression can be regulated by nearby elements in the genome. Promoter analysis involves the identification and study of  |sequence_motifs|Sequence_Motif|  in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA.  |Enhancer|Enhancer|  elements far away from the promoter can also regulate gene expression, through three-dimensional looping interactions. These interactions can be determined by bioinformatic analysis of  |chromosome_conformation_capture|Chromosome_Conformation_Capture|  experiments.     Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare  |microarray|Microarray|  data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the  |cell_cycle|Cell_Cycle| , along with various stress conditions . One can then apply  |clustering_algorithms|Cluster_Analysis|  to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented  |regulatory_elements|Regulatory_Elements| . Examples of clustering algorithms applied in gene clustering are  |k-means_clustering|K-Means_Clustering| ,  |self-organizing_maps|Self-Organizing_Map|  ,  |hierarchical_clustering|Hierarchical_Clustering| , and  |consensus_clustering|Consensus_Clustering|  methods.       Several approaches have been developed to analyze the location of organelles, genes, proteins, and other components within cells. This is relevant as the location of these components affects the events within a cell and thus helps us to predict the behavior of biological systems. A  |gene_ontology|Gene_Ontology|  category, cellular compartment, has been devised to capture subcellular localization in many  |biological_databases|Biological_Database| .       Microscopic pictures allow us to locate both  |organelles|Organelle|  as well as molecules. It may also help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells, e.g. in  |cancer|Cancer| .       The localization of proteins helps us to evaluate the role of a protein. For instance, if a protein is found in the  |nucleus|Cell_Nucleus|  it may be involved in  |gene_regulation|Regulation_Of_Gene_Expression|  or  |splicing|Rna_Splicing| . By contrast, if a protein is found in  |mitochondria|Mitochondrion| , it may be involved in  |respiration|Cellular_Respiration|  or other  |metabolic_processes|Metabolism| . Protein localization is thus an important component of  |protein_function_prediction|Protein_Function_Prediction| . There are well developed  |protein_subcellular_localization_prediction|Protein_Subcellular_Localization_Prediction|  resources available, including protein subcellular location databases, and prediction tools.            Data from high-throughput  |chromosome_conformation_capture|Chromosome_Conformation_Capture|  experiments, such as  |Hi-C|Hi-C|  and  |ChIA-PET|Chia-Pet| , can provide information on the spatial proximity of DNA loci. Analysis of these experiments can determine the three-dimensional structure and  |nuclear_organization|Nuclear_Organization|  of chromatin. Bioinformatic challenges in this field include partitioning the genome into domains, such as  |Topologically_Associating_Domains|Topologically_Associating_Domain|  , that are organised together in three-dimensional space.                   Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  sequence of a protein, the so-called  |primary_structure|Primary_Structure| , can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment.  Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. Structural information is usually classified as one of  secondary ,  tertiary  and  quaternary  structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. Most efforts have so far been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.     One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of  |homology|Sequence_Homology| . In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene A, whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene B, whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share As function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called  |homology_modeling|Homology_Modeling| , this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably.     One example of this is hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes , which are distant relatives from the same  |protein_superfamily|Protein_Superfamily| . Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Although both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes and shared ancestor.      Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and de novo physics-based modeling.     Another aspect of structural bioinformatics include the use of protein structures for  |Virtual_Screening|Virtual_Screening|  models such as  |Quantitative_Structure-Activity_Relationship|Qsar|  models and proteochemometric models . Furthermore, a proteins crystal structure can be used in simulation of for example ligand-binding studies and in silico mutagenesis studies.            Network analysis seeks to understand the relationships within  |biological_networks|Biological_Network|  such as  |metabolic|Metabolic_Network|  or  |protein–protein_interaction_networks|Interactome| . Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity , network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically, functionally, or both.     Systems biology involves the use of  |computer_simulations|Computer_Simulation|  of  |cellular|Cell|  subsystems  to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.  |Artificial_life|Artificial_Life|  or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple life forms.               Tens of thousands of three-dimensional protein structures have been determined by  |X-ray_crystallography|X-Ray_Crystallography|  and  |protein_nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy|Protein_Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance_Spectroscopy|  and a central question in structural bioinformatics is whether it is practical to predict possible protein–protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without performing  |protein–protein_interaction|Protein–Protein_Interaction|  experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the  |protein–protein_docking|Protein–Protein_Docking|  problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.     Other interactions encountered in the field include Protein–ligand and  |protein–peptide|Protein–Peptide| . Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational  |algorithms|Algorithm| , termed docking algorithms, for studying  |molecular_interactions|Interactome| .                The growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed sub-fields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example:   Abbreviation recognition – identify the long-form and abbreviation of biological terms   Named entity recognition – recognizing biological terms such as gene names   Protein–protein interaction – identify which  |proteins|Protein|  interact with which proteins from text     The area of research draws from  |statistics|Statistics|  and  |computational_linguistics|Computational_Linguistics| .       Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content  |biomedical_imagery|Medical_Imaging| . Modern  |image_analysis|Image_Analysis|  systems augment an observers ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving  |accuracy|Accuracy| ,  |objectivity|Objectivity| , or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both  |diagnostics|Diagnostics|  and research. Some examples are:   high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization     |morphometrics|Morphometrics| |DNA_mapping|Gene_Mapping| , e.g. the  |Sulston_score|Sulston_Score|           Computational techniques are used to analyse high-throughput, low-measurement single cell data, such as that obtained from  |flow_cytometry|Flow_Cytometry| . These methods typically involve finding populations of cells that are relevant to a particular disease state or experimental condition.          Biodiversity informatics deals with the collection and analysis of  |biodiversity|Biodiversity|  data, such as  |taxonomic_databases|Taxonomic_Database| , or  |microbiome|Microbiome|  data. Examples of such analyses include  |phylogenetics|Phylogenetics| ,  |niche_modelling|Niche_Modelling| ,  |species_richness|Species_Richness|  mapping,  |DNA_barcoding|Dna_Barcoding| , or  |species|Speciesism|  identification tools.       Biological ontologies are  |directed_acyclic_graphs|Directed_Acyclic_Graph|  of  |controlled_vocabularies|Controlled_Vocabulary| . They are designed to capture biological concepts and descriptions in a way that can be easily categorised and analysed with computers. When categorised in this way, it is possible to gain added value from holistic and integrated analysis.     The  |OBO_Foundry|Obo_Foundry|  was an effort to standardise certain ontologies. One of the most widespread is the  |Gene_ontology|Gene_Ontology|  which describes gene function. There are also ontologies which describe phenotypes.          Databases are essential for bioinformatics research and applications. Many databases exist, covering various information types: for example, DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, phenotypes and biodiversity. Databases may contain empirical data , predicted data , or, most commonly, both. They may be specific to a particular organism, pathway or molecule of interest. Alternatively, they can incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases. These databases vary in their format, access mechanism, and whether they are public or not.     Some of the most commonly used databases are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, please check the link at the beginning of the subsection.
