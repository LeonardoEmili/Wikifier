Fins, scales, and bones of all but the largest of smelts are cooked without removal.     On the Maine coast, smelts were also a sign of spring, with the run of these small fish up tiny tidal estuaries.

The fish did not command a high price on the market, but provided a source of supplemental income due to their abundance. The smelts were flash frozen simply by leaving them on the ice and then sold to fish buyers who came down the rivers.     In the present day, smelts are fished both commercially using nets at sea, and for recreation by hand-netting them or spearing or angling them through holes in river ice. They are often the target fish of small fishing shack villages that spring up along frozen rivers. Typical ways of preparing them include pan-frying in flour and butter, or deep-frying in batter, and they are sometimes cooked directly out of the water over small stoves in the shacks.
