   In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a  |function|Function|  f from a  |set|Set|  X to a set Y is surjective , or a surjection, if for every  |element|Element|  y in the  |codomain|Codomain|  Y of f there is at least one element x in the  |domain|Domain_Of_A_Function|  X of f such that f y. It is not required that x be  |unique|Unique| ; the function f may map one or more elements of X to the same element of Y.          The term surjective and the related terms  injective  and  bijective  were introduced by  |Nicolas_Bourbaki|Nicolas_Bourbaki| , . a group of mainly  |French|France|  20th-century  |mathematicians|Mathematician|  who under this pseudonym wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, beginning in 1935. The French word  sur  means over or above and relates to the fact that the  |image|Image|  of the domain of a surjective function completely covers the functions codomain.     Any function induces a surjection by  |restricting|Restriction_Of_A_Function|  its codomain to the image of its domain. Every surjective function has a  |right_inverse|Inverse_Functionleft_And_Right_Inverses| , and every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The  |composite|Function_Composition|  of surjective functions is always surjective. Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection.          A surjective function is a  |function|Function|  whose  |image|Image|  is equal to its  |codomain|Codomain| . Equivalently, a function f with  |domain|Domain_Of_A_Function|  X and codomain Y is surjective if for every y in Y there exists at least one x in X with fy . Surjections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow ,  as in f : X ↠ Y.     Symbolically,     :If f  X   Y , then f is said to be surjective if     :   y   Y,     x   X,   fy .          For any set X, the  |identity_function|Identity_Function|  id X on X is surjective.     The function  defined by f n  mod  2  is surjective.     The function  defined by f 2x + 1 is surjective , because for every  |real_number|Real_Number|  y we have an x such that f yx is /2.     The function  defined by f x 3 − 3x is surjective, because the pre-image of any  |real_number|Real_Number|  y is the solution set of the cubic polynomial equation x 3 − 3x − y 0 and every cubic polynomial with real coefficients has at least one real root. However, this function is not  |injective|Injective_Function|   since e.g. the pre-image of y 2 is .      The function  defined by g x 2  is not surjective, because there is no real number x such that x 2 −1. However, the function  defined by g x 2  is surjective because for every y in the nonnegative real codomain Y there is at least one x in the real domain X such that x 2 y.     The  |natural_logarithm|Natural_Logarithm|  function  is a surjective and even bijective mapping from the set of positive real numbers to the set of all real numbers. Its inverse, the  |exponential_function|Exponential_Function| , is not surjective as its range is the set of positive real numbers, and its domain is usually defined to be the set of all real numbers. The  |matrix_exponential|Matrix_Exponential|  is not surjective when seen as a map from the space of all n×n  |matrices|Matrix|  to itself. It is, however, usually defined as a map from the space of all n×n matrices to the  |general_linear_group|General_Linear_Group|  of degree n, i.e. the  |group|Group|  of all n×n  |invertible_matrices|Invertible_Matrix| . Under this definition the matrix exponential is surjective for complex matrices, although still not surjective for real matrices.     The  |projection|Projection|  from a  |cartesian_product|Cartesian_Product|   to one of its factors is surjective unless the other factor is empty.     In a 3D video game, vectors are projected onto a 2D flat screen by means of a surjective function.                      A function is  |bijective|Bijective_Function|  if and only if it is both surjective and  |injective|Injective_Function| .     If a function is identified with its  |graph|Graph_Of_A_Function| , then surjectivity is not a property of the function itself, but rather a property of the  |mapping|Map|   . This is, the function together with its codomain. Unlike injectivity, surjectivity cannot be read off of the graph of the function alone.       The function  is said to be a  |right_inverse|Inverse_Functionleft_And_Right_Inverses|  of the function  if f y for every y in Y . In other words, g is a right inverse of f if the  |composition|Function_Composition|   of g and f in that order is the  |identity_function|Identity_Function|  on the domain Y of g. The function g need not be a complete  |inverse|Inverse_Function|  of f because the composition in the other order, , may not be the identity function on the domain X of f. In other words, f can undo or reverse g, but cannot necessarily be reversed by it.     Every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The proposition that every surjective function has a right inverse is equivalent to the  |axiom_of_choice|Axiom_Of_Choice| .     If  is surjective and B is a  |subset|Subset|  of Y, then f B. Thus, B can be recovered from its  |preimage|Preimage|  .     For example, in the first illustration, above, there is some function g such that g 4. There is also some function f such that f C. It doesnt matter that g can also equal 3; it only matters that f reverses g  non-surjective function.          A function  is surjective if and only if it is  |right-cancellative|Right-Cancellative|  given any functions , whenever g o f h o f, then g h. This property is formulated in terms of functions and their  |composition|Function_Composition|  and can be generalized to the more general notion of the  |morphisms|Morphism|  of a  |category|Category|  and their composition. Right-cancellative morphisms are called  |epimorphisms|Epimorphism| . Specifically, surjective functions are precisely the epimorphisms in the  |category_of_sets|Category_Of_Sets| . The prefix epi is derived from the Greek preposition ἐπί meaning over, above, on.     Any morphism with a right inverse is an epimorphism, but the converse is not true in general. A right inverse g of a morphism f is called a  |section|Section|  of f. A morphism with a right inverse is called a  |split_epimorphism|Split_Epimorphism| .       Any function with domain X and codomain Y can be seen as a  |left-total|Left-Total_Relation|  and  |right-unique|Right-Unique_Relation|  binary relation between X and Y by identifying it with its  |function_graph|Function_Graph| . A surjective function with domain X and codomain Y is then a binary relation between X and Y that is right-unique and both left-total and  |right-total|Right-Total_Relation| .       The  |cardinality|Cardinality|  of the domain of a surjective function is greater than or equal to the cardinality of its codomain: If  is a surjective function, then X has at least as many elements as Y, in the sense of  |cardinal_numbers|Cardinal_Number| .      Specifically, if both X and Y are  |finite|Finite_Set|  with the same number of elements, then  is surjective if and only if f is  |injective|Injective| .     Given two sets X and Y, the notation  is used to say that either X is empty or that there is a surjection from Y onto X. Using the axiom of choice one can show that  and  together imply that  Y X  a variant of the  |Schröder–Bernstein_theorem|Schröder–Bernstein_Theorem| .       The  |composite|Function_Composition|  of surjective functions is always surjective: If f and g are both surjective, and the codomain of g is equal to the domain of f, then  is surjective. Conversely, if  is surjective, then f is surjective . These properties generalize from surjections in the  |category_of_sets|Category_Of_Sets|  to any  |epimorphisms|Epimorphism|  in any  |category|Category| .     Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an  |injection|Injective_Function|  there exist a surjection  and an injection  such that h g o f. To see this, define Y to be the set of  |preimages|Preimage|   where z is in . These preimages are  |disjoint|Disjoint_Sets|  and  |partition|Partition_Of_A_Set|  X. Then f carries each x to the element of Y which contains it, and g carries each element of Y to the point in Z to which h sends its points. Then f is surjective since it is a projection map, and g is injective by definition.       Any function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain to its range. Any surjective function induces a bijection defined on a  |quotient|Quotient_Set|  of its domain by collapsing all arguments mapping to a given fixed image. More precisely, every surjection  can be factored as a projection followed by a bijection as follows. Let A/~ be the  |equivalence_class|Equivalence_Class| es of A under the following  |equivalence_relation|Equivalence_Relation| x ~ y if and only if f f. Equivalently, A/~ is the set of all preimages under f. Let P : A → A/~ be the  |projection_map|Projection_Map|  which sends each x in A to its equivalence class x ~ , and let f P : A/~ → B be the well-defined function given by f P  f. Then f f P o P.
