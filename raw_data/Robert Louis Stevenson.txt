              Robert Louis Stevenson was a Scottish novelist and travel writer, most noted for  Treasure Island ,  Kidnapped ,  Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , and  A Childs Garden of Verses .     Born and educated in Edinburgh, Stevenson suffered from serious bronchial trouble for much of his life, but continued to write prolifically and travel widely in defiance of his poor health. As a young man, he mixed in London literary circles, receiving encouragement from  |Andrew_Lang|Andrew_Lang| ,  |Edmund_Gosse|Edmund_Gosse| ,  |Leslie_Stephen|Leslie_Stephen|  and  |W_E_Henley|William_Ernest_Henley| , the last of whom may have provided the model for  |Long_John_Silver|Long_John_Silver|  in Treasure Island. Stevenson spent several years in search of a location suited to his health, before finally settling in  |Samoa|Samoa| , where he died.     A celebrity in his lifetime, Stevensons critical reputation has fluctuated since his death, though today his works are held in general acclaim. He is currently ranked as the 26th most translated author in the world.                 Stevenson was born at 8 Howard Place,  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| , Scotland on 13 November 1850 to  |Thomas_Stevenson|Thomas_Stevenson|  , a leading lighthouse engineer, and his wife Margaret Isabella . He was christened Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson. At about age 18, he changed the spelling of Lewis to Louis , and he dropped Balfour in 1873. Mehew . The spelling Lewis is said to have been rejected because his father violently disliked another person of the same name, and the new spelling was not accompanied by a change of pronunciation .     Lighthouse design was the familys profession; Thomass father was civil engineer  |Robert_Stevenson|Robert_Stevenson| , and Thomass brothers  |Alan|Alan_Stevenson|  and  |David|David_Stevenson|  were in the same field. Paxton . Thomass maternal grandfather  |Thomas_Smith|Thomas_Smith|  had been in the same profession. However, Roberts mothers family were gentry, tracing their lineage back to Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of  |Inchyra|Inchyra|  in Fife in the fifteenth century. His mothers father Lewis Balfour was a minister of the  |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland|  at nearby  |Colinton|Colinton| , Balfour , 10–12; Furnas , 24; Mehew . and her siblings included physician  |George_William_Balfour|George_William_Balfour|  and marine engineer  |James_Balfour|James_Balfour| . Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfathers house. Now I often wonder what I inherited from this old minister, Stevenson wrote. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them.  Memories and Portraits  , .     Lewis Balfour and his daughter both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates for their health. Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when the family moved to a damp, chilly house at 1 Inverleith Terrace in 1851.  The family moved again to the sunnier 17 Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was 11. Illness was a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Furnas , 25–8; Mehew . Contemporaneous views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was  |bronchiectasis|Bronchiectasis|   or even  |sarcoidosis|Sarcoidosis| .      Stevensons parents were both devout Presbyterians, but the household was not strict in its adherence to Calvinist principles. His nurse  |Alison_Cunningham|Alison_Cunningham|   was more fervently religious. Her mix of Calvinism and folk beliefs were an early source of nightmares for the child, and he showed a precocious concern for religion. Furnas , 28–32; Mehew . But she also cared for him tenderly in illness, reading to him from  |John_Bunyan|John_Bunyan|  and the Bible as he lay sick in bed and telling tales of the  |Covenanters|Covenanter| . Stevenson recalled this time of sickness in The Land of Counterpane in  A Childs Garden of Verses  , Available at  and elsewhere. dedicating the book to his nurse. Furnas , 29; Mehew .      Stevenson was an only child, both strange-looking and eccentric, and he found it hard to fit in when he was sent to a nearby school at age 6, a problem repeated at age 11 when he went on to the  |Edinburgh_Academy|Edinburgh_Academy| ; but he mixed well in lively games with his cousins in summer holidays at  |Colinton|Colinton| . Furnas , 34–6; Mehew . Alison Cunninghams recollection of Stevenson balances the picture of an oversensitive child, like other bairns, whiles very naughty : Furnas , 30. His frequent illnesses often kept him away from his first school, so he was taught for long stretches by private tutors. He was a late reader, learning at age 7 or 8, but even before this he dictated stories to his mother and nurse, Mehew . and he compulsively wrote stories throughout his childhood. His father was proud of this interest; he had also written stories in his spare time until his own father found them and told him to give up such nonsense and mind your business. He paid for the printing of Roberts first publication at 16, entitled The Pentland Rising: A Page of History, 1666. It was an account of the  |Covenanters_rebellion|Covenantersrestoration_And_The_Killing_Time|  which was published in 1866, the 200th anniversary of the event. Balfour I, 67; Furnas , pp. 43–45.       In September 1857, Stevenson went to Mr Hendersons School in India Street, Edinburgh, but because of poor health stayed only a few weeks and did not return until October 1859. During his many absences he was taught by private tutors. In October 1861, he went to  |Edinburgh_Academy|Edinburgh_Academy| , an independent school for boys, and stayed there sporadically for about fifteen months. In the autumn of 1863, he spent one term at an English boarding school at Spring Grove in  |Isleworth|Isleworth|  in Middlesex . In October 1864, following an improvement to his health, he was sent to Robert Thomsons private school in Frederick Street, Edinburgh, where he remained until he went to university. .

He showed from the start no enthusiasm for his studies and devoted much energy to avoiding lectures. This time was more important for the friendships he made with other students in the  |Speculative_Society|The_Speculative_Society|  , particularly with Charles Baxter, who would become Stevensons financial agent, and with a professor,  |Fleeming_Jenkin|Fleeming_Jenkin| , whose house staged amateur drama in which Stevenson took part, and whose biography he would later write. Furnas , 51–54, 60–62; Mehew Perhaps most important at this point in his life was a cousin, Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson , a lively and light-hearted young man who, instead of the family profession, had chosen to study art. Balfour I, 86–8; 90–4; Furnas , 64–9 Each year during vacations, Stevenson travelled to inspect the familys engineering works—to  |Anstruther|Anstruther|  and  |Wick|Wick_Highland|  in 1868, with his father on his official tour of  |Orkney|Orkney|  and  |Shetland|Shetland|  islands lighthouses in 1869, and for three weeks to the island of  |Erraid|Erraid|  in 1870. He enjoyed the travels more for the material they gave for his writing than for any engineering interest. The voyage with his father pleased him because a similar journey of  |Walter_Scott|Walter_Scott|  with Robert Stevenson had provided the inspiration for Scotts 1822 novel  The Pirate . Balfour I, 70–2; Furnas , 48–9; Mehew In April 1871, Stevenson notified his father of his decision to pursue a life of letters. Though the elder Stevenson was naturally disappointed, the surprise cannot have been great, and Stevensons mother reported that he was wonderfully resigned to his sons choice. To provide some security, it was agreed that Stevenson should read Law and  |be_called_to_the_Scottish_bar|Admission_To_Practice_Law| . Balfour I, 85–6 In his 1887 poetry collection Underwoods, Stevenson muses on his having turned from the family profession: Underwoods , Poem XXXVIII     Say not of me that weakly I declined   The labours of my sires, and fled the sea,   The towers we founded and the lamps we lit,   To play at home with paper like a child.   But rather say: In the afternoon of time   A strenuous family dusted from its hands   The sand of granite, and beholding far   Along the sounding coast its pyramids   And tall memorials catch the dying sun,   Smiled well content, and to this childish task   Around the fire addressed its evening hours.     In other respects too, Stevenson was moving away from his upbringing. His dress became more  |Bohemian|Bohemianism| ; he already wore his hair long, but he now took to wearing a velveteen jacket and rarely attended parties in conventional evening dress. Furnas , 69–70; Mehew Within the limits of a strict allowance, he visited cheap pubs and brothels. Furnas , 53–7; Mehew  .
