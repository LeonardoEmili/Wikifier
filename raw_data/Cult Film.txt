                A cult film or cult movie, also commonly referred to as a cult classic, is a  |film|Film|  that has acquired a  |cult_following|Cult_Following| . Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate  |fanbase|Fanbase| , an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and  |audience_participation|Audience_Participation| . Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially  |box_office_bombs|Box_Office_Bomb| , while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure,  |transgressive|Transgressive_Art|  films shunned by the  |mainstream|Mainstream| . The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror  |classificatory_disputes_about_art|Classificatory_Disputes_About_Art| . The term cult film itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded  |underground_films|Underground_Film|  and  |midnight_movies|Midnight_Movie| , though cult was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.     Cult films trace their origin back to controversial and  |suppressed|Film_Censorship|  films kept alive by dedicated fans. In some cases, reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release, occasionally for their  |camp|Camp|  value. Other cult films have since become well-respected or reassessed as classics; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films. After failing in the cinema, some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or profitable sellers on home video. Others have inspired their own  |film_festivals|Film_Festival| . Cult films can both appeal to specific subcultures and form their own subcultures. Other media that reference cult films can easily identify which demographics they desire to attract and offer savvy fans an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.     Cult films frequently break cultural taboos, and many feature excessive displays of violence, gore, sexuality, profanity, or combinations thereof. This can lead to controversy, censorship, and outright bans; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent. Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films. Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films; fans of these films often emphasize the films niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects. Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons, such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing, will often be ostracized or ridiculed. Likewise, fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection.     Since the late 1970s, cult films have become increasingly popular. Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream, and showings of cult films have proved to be a profitable business venture. Overbroad usage of the term has resulted in controversy, as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is the slightest bit weird or unconventional; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic. Films are frequently stated to be an instant cult classic now, occasionally before they are released. Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release. At the same time, other films have acquired massive, quick cult followings, owing to spreading  |virally|Viral_Marketing|  through  |social_media|Social_Media| . Easy access to cult films via  |video_on_demand|Video_On_Demand|  and  |peer-to-peer_file_sharing|Peer-To-Peer_File_Sharing|  has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films.          A cult film is any film that has a  |cult_following|Cult_Following| , although the term is not easily defined and can be applied to a wide variety of films.  Some definitions exclude films that have been released by major studios or have big budgets,  that try specifically to become cult films,  or become accepted by mainstream audiences and critics.  Cult films are defined by audience reaction as much as by their content.  This may take the form of elaborate and ritualized  |audience_participation|Audience_Participation| ,  |film_festivals|Film_Festival| , or  |cosplay|Cosplay| . Over time, the definition has become more vague and inclusive as it drifts away from earlier, stricter views.  Increasing use of the term by mainstream publications has resulted in controversy, as  |cinephiles|Cinephile|  argue that the term has become meaningless  or elastic, a catchall for anything slightly maverick or strange .  |Martin,_Adrian|Adrian_Martin|  . Whats Cult Got to Do with It? In Defense of Cinephile Elitism.  Cineaste , Winter 2008, 34 , cited by Dan Bentley-Baker. .  Bright Lights Film Journal . Retrieved 2013-04-27. Academic Mark Shiel has criticized the term itself as being a weak concept, reliant on subjectivity; different groups can interpret films in their own terms.  According to feminist scholar Joanne Hollows, this subjectivity causes films with large female cult followings to be perceived as too mainstream and not transgressive enough to qualify as a cult film.   Academic Mike Chopra‑Gant says that cult films become decontextualized when studied as a group,  and Shiel criticizes this  |recontextualization|Recontextualization|  as  |cultural_commodification|Cultural_Commodification| .     In 2008,  Cineaste  asked a range of academics for their definition of a cult film. Several people defined cult films primarily in terms of their opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a  |transgressive|Transgressive_Art|  element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to conventional moviegoers and mainstreaming of cult films. Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements. Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior. Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria. Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in  |structuration|Structuration| , where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized.  |Ernest_Mathijs|Ernest_Mathijs|  focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while  |Jonathan_Rosenbaum|Jonathan_Rosenbaum|  rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword. Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term. That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident.  This ambiguity leads critics of  |postmodernism|Postmodernism|  to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism, as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or  |metanarratives|Metanarrative| . These inherent dichotomies can lead audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans.      Writing in Defining Cult Movies, Jancovich et al. quote academic Jeffrey Sconce, who defines cult films in terms of  |paracinema|Paracinema| , marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance: everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography. However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their subcultural ideology and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term. Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally. At the same time, they state that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than a rebellion against it. This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as  |defamiliarization|Defamiliarization| .  This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream. This nonconformity is eventually co-opted by the dominant forces, such as Hollywood, and marketed to the mainstream.  Academic  |Xavier_Mendik|Xavier_Mendik|  also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult by virtue of their genre or content, especially if it is transgressive. Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.        Cult films have existed since the early days of cinema. Film critic Harry Allan Potamkin traces them back to 1910s France and the reception of  |Pearl_White|Pearl_White| ,  |William_S._Hart|William_S._Hart| , and  |Charlie_Chaplin|Charlie_Chaplin| , which he described as a dissent from the popular ritual .   Nosferatu  was an unauthorized adaptation of  |Bram_Stokers|Bram_Stoker|   Dracula . Stokers widow sued the production company and drove it to bankruptcy. All known copies of the film were destroyed, and Nosferatu become an early cult film, kept alive by a cult following that circulated illegal bootlegs.  Academic Chuck Kleinhans identifies the  |Marx_Brothers|Marx_Brothers|  as making other early cult films. On their original release, some highly regarded classics from the  |Golden_Age_of_Hollywood|Golden_Age_Of_Hollywood|  were panned by critics and audiences, relegated to cult status.  The Night of the Hunter  was a cult film for years, quoted often and championed by fans, before it was reassessed as an important and influential classic.  During this time, American  |exploitation_films|Exploitation_Film|  and imported European  |art_films|Art_Film|  were marketed similarly. Although critics  |Pauline_Kael|Pauline_Kael|  and  |Arthur_Knight|Arthur_Knight|  argued against arbitrary divisions into  |high|High_Culture|  and  |low_culture|Low_Culture| , American films settled into rigid genres; European art films continued to push the boundaries of simple definitions, and these exploitative art films and artistic exploitation films would go on to influence American cult films.   Much like later cult films, these early exploitation films encouraged audience participation, influenced by live theater and vaudeville.     Modern cult films grew from 1960s  |counterculture|Counterculture|  and  |underground_films|Underground_Film| , popular among those who rejected mainstream Hollywood films. These underground film festivals led to the creation of  |midnight_movies|Midnight_Movie| , which attracted cult followings.  The term cult film itself was an outgrowth of this movement and was first used in the 1970s,  though cult had been in use for decades in film analysis with both positive and negative connotations.  These films were more concerned with cultural significance than the social justice sought by earlier  |avant-garde_films|Avant-Garde_Film| . Midnight movies became more popular and mainstream, peaking with the release of  The Rocky Horror Picture Show  , which finally found its audience several years after its release. Eventually, the rise of home video would marginalize midnight movies once again, after which many directors joined the burgeoning  |independent_film|Independent_Film|  scene or went back underground.  Home video would give a second life to box office flops, as positive  |word-of-mouth|Word-Of-Mouth|  or excessive replay on cable television led these films to develop an appreciative audience,  as well as obsessive replay and study.  For example,  The Beastmaster  , despite its failure at the box office, became one of the most played movies on American cable television   and developed into a cult film. Home video and television broadcasts of cult films were initially greeted with hostility. Joanne Hollows states that they were seen as turning cult films mainstream – in effect, feminizing them by opening them to distracted, passive audiences.           Releases from major studios – such as  The Big Lebowski  , which was distributed by  |Universal_Studios|Universal_Studios|  – can become cult films when they fail at the box office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video. Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture. With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues. The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as The Big Lebowski, can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers. Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial.  Discussing his reputation for making cult films,  |Bollywood|Bollywood|  director  |Anurag_Kashyap|Anurag_Kashyap|  said, I didnt set out to make cult films. I wanted to make box-office hits.  Writing in Cult Cinema, academics Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton state that this acceptance of mainstream culture and commercialism is not out of character, as cult audiences have a more complex relationship to these concepts: they are more opposed to mainstream values and excessive commercialism than they are anything else.      In a global context, popularity can vary widely by territory, especially with regard to limited releases.  Mad Max  was an international hit – except in America  where it became an obscure cult favorite, ignored by critics and available for years only in a dubbed version though it earned over $100M internationally.   Foreign cinema can put a different spin on popular genres, such as  |Japanese_horror|Japanese_Horror| , which was initially a cult favorite in America.  Asian imports to the West are often marketed as exotic cult films and of interchangeable national identity, which academic Chi-Yun Shin criticizes as reductive.  Foreign influence can affect fan response, especially on genres tied to a national identity; when they become more global in scope, questions of authenticity may arise.   Filmmakers and films ignored in their own country can become the objects of cult adoration in another, producing perplexed reactions in their native country.  Cult films can also establish an early viability for more mainstream films both for filmmakers and national cinema. The early cult horror films of  |Peter_Jackson|Peter_Jackson|  were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and  |its_cinema|Cinema_Of_New_Zealand| . As more artistic films emerged, New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood, which mirrored Jacksons career trajectory.  Heavenly Creatures  acquired its own cult following, became a part of New Zealands national identity, and paved the way for big-budget, Hollywood-style epics, such as Jacksons  |The_Lord_of_the_Rings_trilogy|The_Lord_Of_The_Rings| .      Mathijs states that cult films and fandom frequently involve nontraditional elements of time and time management. Fans will often watch films obsessively, an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet can be seen as resisting the commodification of leisure time. They may also watch films idiosyncratically: sped up, slowed down, frequently paused, or at odd hours. Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time – time travel, non-linear narratives, and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular. Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits, such as viewing horror films on Halloween, sentimental melodrama on Christmas, and romantic films on Valentines Day. These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites.  Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor. These films, ritually watched every season, give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers. New films often have trouble making inroads against the institutions of  Its A Wonderful Life  and  Miracle on 34th Street  . These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values.  Halloween, on the other hand, allows flaunting societys taboos and testing ones fears. Horror films have appropriated the holiday, and many horror films debut on Halloween. Mathijs criticizes the over-cultified, commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films, which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community. Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect.      Despite their oppositional nature, cult films can produce celebrities. Like cult films themselves, authenticity is an important aspect of their popularity.  Actors can become typecast as they become strongly associated with such iconic roles.  |Tim_Curry|Tim_Curry| , despite his acknowledged range as an actor, found casting difficult after he achieved fame in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Even when discussing unrelated projects, interviewers frequently bring up the role, which causes him to tire of discussing it.   |Mary_Woronov|Mary_Woronov| , known for her transgressive roles in cult films, eventually transitioned to mainstream films. She was expected to recreate the transgressive elements of her cult films within the confines of mainstream cinema. Instead of the complex gender deconstructions of her  |Andy_Warhol|Andy_Warhol|  films, she became typecast as a lesbian or domineering woman.   |Sylvia_Kristel|Sylvia_Kristel| , after starring in  Emmanuelle  , found herself highly associated with the film and the sexual liberation of the 1970s. Caught between the transgressive elements of her cult film and the mainstream appeal of soft-core pornography, she was unable to work in anything but exploitation films and Emmanuelle sequels. Despite her immense popularity and cult following, she would rate only a footnote in most histories of European cinema if she was even mentioned.  Similarly,  |Chloë_Sevigny|Chloë_Sevigny|  has struggled with her reputation as a cult independent film star famous for her daring roles in transgressive films.  Cult films can also trap directors.  |Leonard_Kastle|Leonard_Kastle| , who directed  The Honeymoon Killers  , never directed another film again. Despite his cult following, which included  |François_Truffaut|François_Truffaut| , he was unable to find financing for any of his other screenplays.  Qualities that bring cult films to prominence – such as an uncompromising, unorthodox vision – caused  |Alejandro_Jodorowsky|Alejandro_Jodorowsky|  to languish in obscurity for years.        Transgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s. Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of  |European_art_cinema|European_Art_Cinema|  and  |experimental_film|Experimental_Film| , the gritty subject matter of  |Italian_neorealism|Italian_Neorealism| , and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation. Some used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time. In the 1980s, filmmaker  |Nick_Zedd|Nick_Zedd|  identified this movement as the  |Cinema_of_Transgression|Cinema_Of_Transgression|  and later wrote a manifesto. Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as downtown culture . These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as  The Village Voice . Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film.   Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film.  Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as  Battle Royale  , which broke many rules of teenage  |slasher_films|Slasher_Film| .  The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans.  Audience participation itself can be transgressive, such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.       According to Mathijs, critical reception is important to a films perception as cult, through topicality and controversy. Topicality, which can be regional or critical , enables attention and a contextual response. Cultural topics make the film relevant and can lead to controversy, such as a  |moral_panic|Moral_Panic| , which provides opposition. Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film. These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not be at all similar. However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important. While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist. Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status.  Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, an example of which would be Rex Reeds  |comments_about_Korean_culture|Rex_Reedoffensive_Comments_In_Reviews|  in his review of  Oldboy  . Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as how Joe Bob Briggs and  |Roger_Ebert|Roger_Ebert|  dueled over  I Spit On Your Grave  . Briggs would later contribute a commentary track to the DVD release in which he describes it as a feminist film.  Films which do not attract enough controversy may be ridiculed and rejected when suggested as cult films.      Academic Peter Hutchings, noting the many definitions of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known in part for their excesses. Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms. Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema.  |Film_censorship|Film_Censorship|  can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films. Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors. Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema.   In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted. Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films. Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny,  using these films as catharsis for the things that they hate most in life.  Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire.  |Frank_Henenlotter|Frank_Henenlotter|  faced censorship and ridicule, but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch, such as violence, drug addiction, and misogyny.   |Lloyd_Kaufman|Lloyd_Kaufman|  sees his films political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities. Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood, vomit, and diarrhea, Kaufmans films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics.  Excess can also exist as camp, such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism.       Films that are influenced by unpopular styles or genres can become cult films. Director  |Jean_Rollin|Jean_Rollin|  worked within  cinéma fantastique , an unpopular genre in modern France. Influenced by American films and early French fantasists, he drifted between art, exploitation, and pornography. His films were reviled by critics, but he retained a cult following drawn by the nudity and eroticism.  Similarly,  |Jess_Franco|Jess_Franco|  chafed under fascist censorship in Spain but became influential in Spains horror boom of the 1960s.  These transgressive films that straddle the line between art and horror may have overlapping cult followings, each with their own interpretation and reasons for appreciating it. The films that followed Jess Franco were unique in their rejection of mainstream art. Popular among fans of European horror for their subversiveness and obscurity, these later Spanish films allowed political dissidents to criticize the fascist regime within the cloak of exploitation and horror. Unlike most exploitation directors, they were not trying to establish a reputation. They were already established in the art-house world and intentionally chose to work within paracinema as a reaction against the  |New_Spanish_Cinema|Cinema_Of_Spainthe_New_Spanish_Cinema| , an artistic revival supported by the fascists.  As late as the 1980s, critics still cited  |Pedro_Almodóvars|Pedro_Almodóvar|  anti-macho iconoclasm as a rebellion against fascist mores, as he grew from countercultural rebel to mainstream respectability.   Transgressive elements that limit a directors appeal in one country can be celebrated or highlighted in another.  |Takashi_Miike|Takashi_Miike|  has been marketed in the West as a shocking and avant-garde filmmaker despite his many family-friendly comedies, which have not been imported.     The transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship. During the 1970s and early 1980s, a wave of explicit, graphic exploitation films caused controversy. Called  |video_nasties|Video_Nasty|  within the UK, they ignited calls for censorship and stricter laws on home video releases, which were largely unregulated.  Consequently, the  |British_Board_of_Film_Classification|British_Board_Of_Film_Classification|  banned many popular cult films due to issues of sex, violence, and incitement to crime.  Released during the  |cannibal_boom|Cannibal_Boom| ,  Cannibal Holocaust  was banned in dozens of countries and caused the director to be briefly jailed over fears that it was a real  |snuff_film|Snuff_Film| .  Although opposed to censorship, director  |Ruggero_Deodato|Ruggero_Deodato|  would later agree with cuts made by the BBFC which removed unsimulated animal killings, which limited the films distribution.  Frequently banned films may introduce questions of authenticity as fans question whether they have seen a truly uncensored cut. Cult films have been falsely claimed to have been banned to increase their transgressive reputation and explain their lack of mainstream penetration. Marketing campaigns have also used such claims to raise interest among curious audiences.  Home video has allowed cult film fans to import rare or banned films, finally giving them a chance to complete their collection with imports and bootlegs. Cult films previously banned are sometimes released with much fanfare and the fans assumed to be already familiar with the controversy. Personal responsibility is often highlighted, and a strong anti-censorship message may be present.  Previously lost scenes cut by studios can be re-added and restore a directors original vision, which draws similar fanfare and acclaim from fans.  Imports are sometimes censored to remove elements that would be controversial, such as references to Islamic spirituality in Indonesian cult films.      Academics have written of how transgressive themes in cult films can be regressive. David Church and Chuck Kleinhans describe an uncritical celebration of transgressive themes in cult films, including misogyny and racism. Church has also criticized gendered descriptions of transgressive content that celebrate masculinity. Joanne Hollows further identifies a gendered component to the celebration of transgressive themes in cult films, where male terms are used to describe films outside the mainstream while female terms are used to describe mainstream, conformist cinema.  Jacinda Reads expansion states that cult films, despite their potential for empowerment of the marginalized, are more often used by politically incorrect males. Knowledgeable about feminism and multiculturalism, they seek a refuge from the academic acceptance of these progressive ideals. Their playful and ironic acceptance of regressive  |lad_culture|Lad_Culture|  invites, and even dares, condemnation from academics and the uncool. Thus, cult films become a tool to reinforce mainstream values through transgressive content;  Rebecca Feasy states that cultural hierarchies can also be reaffirmed through mockery of films perceived to be lacking masculinity.  However, the  |sexploitation|Sexploitation|  films of  |Doris_Wishman|Doris_Wishman|  took a feminist approach which avoids and subverts the  |male_gaze|Male_Gaze|  and traditional goal-oriented methods. Wishmans subject matter, though exploitative and transgressive, was always framed in terms of female empowerment and the feminine spectator. Her use of common cult film motifs – female nudity and ambiguous gender – were repurposed to comment on feminist topics.  Similarly, the films of  |Russ_Meyer|Russ_Meyer|  were a complicated combination of transgressive, mainstream, progressive, and regressive elements. They attracted both acclaim and denouncement from critics and progressives.  Transgressive films imported from cultures that are recognizably different yet still relatable can be used to progressively examine issues in another culture.        Cult films can be used to help define or create groups as a form of  |subcultural_capital|Subcultural_Capital| ; knowledge of cult films proves that one is authentic or non-mainstream . They can be used to provoke an outraged response from the mainstream, which further defines the subculture, as only members could possibly tolerate such deviant entertainment.  More accessible films have less subcultural capital; among extremists, banned films will have the most. By referencing cult films, media can identify desired demographics, strengthen bonds with specific subcultures, and stand out among those who understand the  |intertextuality|Intertextuality| .  Popular films from previous eras may be reclaimed by genre fans long after they have been forgotten by the original audiences. This can be done for authenticity, such as horror fans who seek out now-obscure titles from the 1950s instead of the modern, well-known remakes.  Authenticity may also drive fans to deny genre categorization to films perceived as too mainstream or accessible.   Authenticity in performance  and expertise  can drive fan acclaim. Authenticity can also drive fans to decry the mainstream in the form of hostile critics and censors.  Especially when promoted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable programmers, choice of venue can be an important part of expressing individuality. Besides creating new communities, cult films can link formerly disparate groups, such as fans and critics.  As these groups intermix, they can influence each other, though this may be resisted by older fans, unfamiliar with these new references.  In extreme cases, cult films can lead to the creation of religions, such as  |Dudeism|Dudeism| .  For their avoidance of mainstream culture and audiences, enjoyment of irony, and celebration of obscure subcultures, academic Martin Roberts compares cult film fans to  |hipsters|Hipster| .           A film can become the object of a cult following within a particular region or culture if it has unusual significance. For example,  |Norman_Wisdoms|Norman_Wisdom|  films, friendly to Marxist interpretation, amassed a cult following in Albania, as they were among the few Western films allowed by the countrys Communist rulers.    The Wizard of Oz  and its star,  |Judy_Garland|Judy_Garland| , hold  |special_significance|Judy_Garland_As_Gay_Icon|  to American and British gay culture, although it is a widely viewed and historically important film in greater American culture. Similarly,  |James_Dean|James_Dean|  and his brief film career have become icons of alienated youth.  Cult films can have such niche appeal that they are only popular within certain subcultures, such as  Reefer Madness   and  Hemp for Victory   among the  |stoner_subculture|Cannabis_Culture| . Beach party musicals, popular among American surfers, failed to find an equivalent audience when imported to the United Kingdom. When films target subcultures like this, they may seem unintelligible without the proper  |cultural_capital|Cultural_Capital| . Films which appeal to teenagers may offer subcultural identities that are easily recognized and differentiate various subcultural groups.  Films which appeal to stereotypical male activities, such as sports, can easily gain strong male cult followings. Sports metaphors are often used in the marketing of cult films to males, such as emphasizing the extreme nature of the film, which increases the appeal to youth subcultures fond of extreme sports.        Matt Hills concept of the cult blockbuster involves cult followings inside larger, mainstream films. Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings. The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and  |fan_works|Fan_Work| . Hills identifies three different cult followings for  The Lord of the Rings , each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream.  Academic Emma Pett identifies  Back to the Future  as another example of a cult blockbuster. Although the film topped the charts when it was released, it has developed a nostalgic cult following over the years. The hammy acting by  |Christopher_Lloyd|Christopher_Lloyd|  and quotable dialogue draw a cult following, as they mimic traditional cult films.  Blockbuster science fiction films that include philosophical subtexts, such as  The Matrix , allow cult film fans to enjoy them on a higher level than the mainstream.   Star Wars , with its large cult following in geek subculture, has been cited as both a cult blockbuster  and a cult film. Although a mainstream epic, Star Wars has provided its fans with a spirituality and culture outside of the mainstream.      Fans, in response to the popularity of these blockbusters, will claim elements for themselves while rejecting others. For example, in the Star Wars film series, mainstream  |criticism_of_Jar_Jar_Binks|Jar_Jar_Binksallegations_Of_Racial_Caricature|  focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing.   Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings. They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media, as cult blockbusters are often franchised, preconceived as a film series, or both. To reduce mainstream accessibility, a film series can be self-reflexive and full of in-jokes that only longtime fans can understand. Mainstream critics may ridicule commercially successful directors of cult blockbusters, such as  |James_Cameron|James_Cameron| ,  |Michael_Bay|Michael_Bay| , and  |Luc_Besson|Luc_Besson| , whose films have been called simplistic. This critical backlash may serve to embellish the filmmakers reception as cult auteurs. In the same way, critics may ridicule fans of cult blockbusters as immature or shallow.      Cult films can create their own subculture. Rocky Horror, originally made to exploit the popularity of  |glam_subculture|Glam_Rock| , became what academic Gina Marchetti called a sub-subculture , a variant that outlived its parent subculture.  Although often described as primarily composed of obsessed fans, cult film fandom can include many newer, less experienced members.  Familiar with the films reputation and having watched clips on YouTube, these fans may take the next step and enter the films fandom. If they are the majority, they may alter or ignore long-standing traditions, such as audience participation rituals; rituals which lack perceived authenticity may be criticized, but accepted rituals bring subcultural capital to veteran fans who introduce them to the newer members. Fans who flaunt their knowledge receive negative reactions. Newer fans may cite the film itself as their reason for attending a showing, but longtime fans often cite the community. Organized fandoms may spread and become popular as a way of introducing new people to the film, as well as theatrical screenings being privileged by the media and fandom itself. Fandom can also be used as a process of legitimation.  Fans of cult films, as in  |media_fandom|Media_Fandom| , are frequently producers instead of mere consumers. Unconcerned with traditional views on intellectual property, these fan works are often unsanctioned, transformative, and ignore  |fictional_canon|Canon| .      Like cult films themselves, magazines and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness. They maintain a sense of exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny, gore, and racism. Obsessive trivia can be used to bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital. Specialist stores on the fringes of society can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom, especially when they use erotic or gory imagery.  By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia, non-fans can be excluded. Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation. Casual readers and non-fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates, as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute. When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons, such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal, they may be ridiculed. Thus, fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the  |Other|Other|  , a philosophical construct divergent from  |social_norms|Norm| . Commercial aspects of fandom can also be defined in terms of otherness and thus valid to consume: consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers, but the mainstream is denigrated. Irony or self-deprecating humor can also be used.  In online communities, different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital. Even within subcultures, fans who break subcultural scripts, such as denying the affectivity of a disturbing film, will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity.            The critic  |Michael_Medved|Michael_Medved|  characterized examples of the so bad its good class of low-budget cult film through books such as  The Golden Turkey Awards . These films include financially fruitless and critically scorned films that have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs, such as  Plan 9 from Outer Space   ,  The Room  ,  and the Ugandan action-comedy film  Who Killed Captain Alex?  .  Similarly,  |Paul_Verhoevens|Paul_Verhoeven|   Showgirls  bombed in theaters but developed a cult following on video. Catching on,  |Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|  capitalized on the films ironic appeal and marketed it as a cult film.  Sometimes, fans will impose their own interpretation of films which have attracted derision, such as reinterpreting an earnest melodrama as a comedy.  Jacob deNobel of the  Carroll County Times  states that films can be perceived as nonsensical or inept when audiences misunderstand avant-garde filmmaking or misinterpret parody. Films such as Rocky Horror can be misinterpreted as weird for weirdness sake by people unfamiliar with the cult films that it parodies. deNobel ultimately rejects the use of the label so bad its good as mean-spirited and often misapplied.   |Alamo_Drafthouse|Alamo_Drafthouse_Cinema|  programmer Zack Carlson has further said that any film which succeeds in entertaining an audience is good, regardless of irony.  In  |francophone|Francophone|  culture, so bad its good films, known as , have given rise to a  |subculture|Subculture|  with dedicated websites such as Nanarland, film festivals and viewings in theaters, as well as various books analyzing the phenomenon. The rise of the Internet and on-demand films has led critics to question whether so bad its good films have a future now that people have such diverse options in both availability and catalog,  though fans eager to experience the worst films ever made can lead to lucrative showings for local theaters  and merchandisers.        Chuck Kleinhans states that the difference between a guilty pleasure and a cult film can be as simple as the number of fans; David Church raises the question of how many people it takes to form a cult following, especially now that home video makes fans difficult to count. As these cult films become more popular, they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as  |camp|Camp| , irony, genuine affection, or combinations thereof. Earnest fans, who recognize and accept the films faults, can make minor celebrities of the films cast,  though the benefits are not always clear.  Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously.  Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious, artistic-minded films. This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle,  |method|Method_Acting| -inspired acting.  Mark Chalon Smith of the  Los Angeles Times  says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas, such as camp or transgressive content. Smith states that the early films of  |John_Waters|John_Waters|  are amateurish and less influential than claimed, but Waters outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema.  Films such as  Myra Breckinridge  and  Beyond the Valley of the Dolls  can experience critical reappraisal later, once their camp excess and avant-garde filmmaking are better accepted,  and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy. Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them, as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic.        According to academic Brigid Cherry,  |nostalgia|Nostalgia|  is a strong element of certain kinds of cult appeal. When  |Veoh|Veoh|  added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity.  Academic I.  Q. Hunter describes cult films as New Hollywood in extremis and a form of nostalgia for that period. Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia as a form of resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time-based economy. By virtue of the time travel plot, Back to the Future permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s. Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period. Similarly, films directed by  |John_Hughes|John_Hughes|  have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism.  Mathijs and Sexton describe  Grease  as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following. Other cult films, such as  Streets of Fire  , create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past.  Cult films may also subvert nostalgia, such as The Big Lebowski, which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow.  Nathan Lee of the  New York Sun  identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche in films such as  Donnie Darko  as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds.        Author Tomas Crowder-Taraborrelli describes  |midnight_movies|Midnight_Movie|  as a reaction against the political and cultural conservatism in America,  and Joan Hawkins identifies the movement as running the gamut from anarchist to  |libertarian|Libertarianism| , united in their anti-establishment attitude and punk aesthetic.  These films are resistant to simple categorization and are defined by the fanaticism and ritualistic behaviors of their audiences. Midnight movies require a night life and an audience willing to invest themselves actively.   Hawkins states that these films took a rather bleak point of view due to the living conditions of the artists and the economic prospects of the 1970s. Like the surrealists and dadaists, they not only satirically attacked society but also the very structure of film – a counter-cinema that deconstructs narrative and traditional processes.  In the late 1980s and 1990s, midnight movies transitioned from underground showings to home video viewings; eventually, a desire for community brought a resurgence, and The Big Lebowski kick-started a new generation. Demographics shifted, and more hip and mainstream audiences were drawn to them. Although studios expressed skepticism, large audiences were drawn to box office flops, such as  Donnie Darko  ,  The Warriors  and  Office Space  .  Modern midnight movies retain their popularity and have been strongly diverging from mainstream films shown at midnight. Mainstream cinemas, eager to disassociate themselves from negative associations and increase profits, have begun abandoning midnight screenings. Although classic midnight movies have dropped off in popularity, they still bring reliable crowds.        Although seemingly at odds with each other,  |art|Art_Film|  and  |exploitation_films|Exploitation_Film|  are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom, listed alongside each other and described in similar terms: their ability to provoke a response. The most exploitative aspects of art films are thus played up and their academic recognition ignored.  This flattening of culture follows the popularity of  |post-structuralism|Post-Structuralism| , which rejects a hierarchy of artistic merit and equates exploitation and art.  Mathijs and Sexton state that although cult films are not synonymous with exploitation, as is occasionally assumed, this is a key component; they write that exploitation, which exists on the fringes of the mainstream and deals with  |taboo|Taboo|  subjects, is well-suited for cult followings.  Academic David Andrews writes that cult softcore films are the most masculinized, youth-oriented, populist, and openly pornographic softcore area.  The sexploitation films of  |Russ_Meyer|Russ_Meyer|  were among the first to abandon all hypocritical pretenses of morality and were technically proficient enough to gain a cult following. His persistent vision saw him received as an auteur worthy of academic study; director John Waters attributes this to Meyers ability to create complicated, sexually charged films without resorting to explicit sex.  Myrna Oliver described  |Doris_Wishmans|Doris_Wishman|  exploitation films as crass, coarse, and camp  ... perfect fodder for a cult following.  Sick films , the most disturbing and graphically transgressive films, have their own distinct cult following; these films transcend their roots in exploitation, horror, and art films.  In 1960s and 1970s America, exploitation and art films shared audiences and marketing, especially in New York Citys  |grindhouse|Grindhouse|  cinemas.        Mathijs and Sexton state that  |genre|Film_Genre|  is an important part of cult films; cult films will often mix, mock, or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres. Science fiction, fantasy, and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings; as science fiction films become more popular, fans emphasize non-mainstream and less commercial aspects of it.   |B_films|B_Film| , which are often conflated with exploitation, are as important to cult films as exploitation. Teodor Reljic of  Malta Today  states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Maltas burgeoning film industry.  Genre films, B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations, can appeal to cult film fans: given their transgressive excesses, horror films are likely to become to cult films;  films like  Galaxy Quest  highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction;  and authentic martial arts skills in  |Hong_Kong_action_films|Hong_Kong_Action_Cinema|  can drive them to become cult favorites.  Cult musicals can range from the traditional, such as  Singin in the Rain  , which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia, camp, and spectacle, to the more non-traditional, such as  Cry-Baby  , which parodies musicals, and Rocky Horror, which uses a rock soundtrack.  Romantic fairy tale  The Princess Bride  failed to attract audiences in its original release, as the studio did not know how to market it.  The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films, and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun.   Ad Week  writes that cult B films, when released on home video, market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia.         |Animation|Animation|  can provide wide open vistas for stories. The French film  Fantastic Planet  explored ideas beyond the limits of traditional, live-action science fiction films.  Phil Hoad of  The Guardian  identifies  Akira  as introducing violent, adult Japanese animation  to the West and paving the way for later works.  Anime, according to academic Brian Ruh, is not a cult genre, but the lack of individual fandoms inside  |anime_fandom|Anime_Fandom|  itself lends itself to a bleeding over of cult attention and can help spread works internationally. Anime, which is often highly turned into series, provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity. The  Ghost in the Shell  films, for example, provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies. Markets that did not support the sale of these materials saw less cult activity.   |Ralph_Bakshis|Ralph_Bakshi|  career has been marked with controversy:  Fritz the Cat  , the first animated film to be  |rated_X_by_the_MPAA|Mpaa_Film_Rating_Systemx_Replaced_By_Nc-17| , provoked outrage for its racial caricatures and graphic depictions of sex, and  Coonskin  was decried as racist.  Bakshi recalls that older animators had tired of kid stuff and desired edgier work, whereas younger animators hated his work for destroying the Disney images . Eventually, his work would be reassessed and cult followings, which include  |Quentin_Tarantino|Quentin_Tarantino|  and  |Robert_Rodriguez|Robert_Rodriguez| , developed around several of his films.   Heavy Metal  faced similar denunciations from critics. Donald Liebenson of the Los Angeles Times cites the violence and sexual imagery as alienating critics, who did not know what to make of the film. It would go on to become a popular midnight movie and frequently bootlegged by fans, as licensing issues kept it from being released on video for many years.        Sensationalistic documentaries called  |mondo_films|Mondo_Film|  replicate the most shocking and transgressive elements of exploitation films. They are usually modeled after sick films and cover similar subject matter. In  The Cult Film Reader , academics Mathijs and Mendik write that these documentaries often present non-Western societies as stereotypically mysterious, seductive, immoral, deceptive, barbaric or savage .  Though they can be interpreted as racist, Mathijs and Mendik state that they also exhibit a liberal attitude towards the breaking of cultural taboos . Mondo films like  Faces of Death  mix real and fake footage freely, and they gain their cult following through the outrage and debate over authenticity that results.  Like so bad its good cult films, old propaganda and government hygiene films may be enjoyed ironically by more modern audiences for the camp value of the outdated themes and outlandish claims made about perceived social threats, such as drug use. Academic Barry K. Grant states that  |Frank_Capras|Frank_Capra|   Why We Fight  World War II propaganda films are explicitly not cult, because they are slickly made and have proven their ability to persuade an audience.  The  |sponsored_film|Sponsored_Film|   Mr. B Natural  became a cult hit when it was broadcast on the satirical television show  Mystery Science Theater 3000 ;  cast member  |Trace_Beaulieu|Trace_Beaulieu|  cited these educational shorts as his favorite to mock on the show.  Mark Jancovich states that cult audiences are drawn to these films because of their very banality or incoherence of their political positions , unlike traditional cult films, which achieve popularity through auteurist radicalism.             Mark Shiel explains the rising popularity of cult films as an attempt by cinephiles and scholars to escape the oppressive conformity and mainstream appeal of even independent film, as well as a lack of condescension in both critics and the films; Academic Donna de Ville says it is a chance to subvert the dominance of academics and cinephiles. According to Xavier Mendik, academics have been really interested in cult movies for quite a while now. Mendik has sought to bring together academic interest and fandom through  |Cine-Excess|Cine-Excess| , a film festival. I. Q. Hunter states that its much easier to be a cultist now, but it is also rather more inconsequential. Citing the mainstream availability of Cannibal Holocaust, Jeffrey Sconce rejects definitions of cult films based on controversy and excess, as theyve now become meaningless.  Cult films have influenced such diverse industries as cosmetics,  music videos, and fashion.  Cult films have shown up in less expected places; as a sign of his popularity, a bronze statue of  |Ed_Wood|Ed_Wood|  has been proposed in his hometown,  and  LOsservatore Romano , the official newspaper of the  |Holy_See|Holy_See| , has courted controversy for its endorsement of cult films and pop culture.  When cities attempt to renovate neighborhoods, fans have called attempts to demolish iconic settings from cult films cultural vandalism .  Cult films can also drive tourism,  even when it is unwanted.      As far back as the 1970s,  Attack of the Killer Tomatoes  was designed specifically to be a cult film,  and The Rocky Horror Picture Show was produced by  |20th_Century_Fox|20Th_Century_Fox| , a major Hollywood studio. Over its decades-long release, Rocky Horror became the seventh highest grossing R-rated film when adjusted for inflation;  Journalist Matt Singer has questioned whether Rocky Horrors popularity invalidates its cult status.  Founded in 1974,  |Troma_Entertainment|Troma_Entertainment| , an independent studio, would become known for both its cult following and cult films.  In the 1980s,  |Danny_Pearys|Danny_Peary|   Cult Movies  would influence director  |Edgar_Wright|Edgar_Wright|   and film critic Scott Tobias of  The A.V. Club .  The rise of home video would have a mainstreaming effect on cult films and cultish behavior, though some collectors would be unlikely to self-identify as cult film fans. Film critic  |Joe_Bob_Briggs|Joe_Bob_Briggs|  began reviewing  |drive-in_theater|Drive-In_Theater|  and cult films, though he faced much criticism as an early advocate of  |exploitation|Exploitation_Film|  and cult films. Briggs highlights the mainstreaming of cult films by pointing out the respectful obituaries that cult directors have received from formerly hostile publications and acceptance of politically incorrect films at mainstream film festivals. This acceptance is not universal, though, and some critics have resisted this mainstreaming of paracinema.  Beginning in the 1990s, director  |Quentin_Tarantino|Quentin_Tarantino|  would have the greatest success in turning cult films mainstream.  Tarantino later used his fame to champion obscure cult films that had influenced him and set up the short-lived  |Rolling_Thunder_Pictures|Rolling_Thunder_Pictures| , which distributed several of his favorite cult films.  Tarantinos clout led Phil Hoad of  The Guardian  to call Tarantino the worlds most influential director.      As major Hollywood studios and audiences both become savvy to cult films, productions once limited to cult appeal have instead become popular hits, and cult directors have become hot properties known for more mainstream and accessible films. Remarking on the popular trend of remaking cult films, Claude Brodesser-Akner of  New York  magazine states that Hollywood studios have been superstitiously hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia.  Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films now that they have finally become successful and mainstream, are too slick to attract a proper cult following, lack context, or are too easily found online.  In response, David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films, often using illegal distribution methods, which preserves the outlaw status of cult films. Virtual spaces, such as online forums and fan sites, replace the traditional  |fanzines|Fanzine|  and newsletters. Cult film fans consider themselves collectors, rather than consumers, as they associate consumers with mainstream, Hollywood audiences.  This collecting can take the place of fetishization of a single film. Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like Rocky Horror, academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings. Koven also identifies television shows, such as  Twin Peaks , as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture.  |David_Lynch|David_Lynch|  himself has not ruled out another television series, as studios have become reluctant to take chances on non-mainstream ideas.  Despite this, the  |Alamo_Drafthouse|Alamo_Drafthouse|  has capitalized on cult films and the surrounding culture through inspiration drawn from Rocky Horror and retro promotional gimmickry. They sell out their shows regularly and have acquired a cult following of their own.     Academic Bob Batchelor, writing in Cult Pop Culture, states that the internet has democratized cult culture and destroyed the line between cult and mainstream. Fans of even the most obscure films can communicate online with each other in vibrant communities.  Although known for their big-budget  |blockbusters|Blockbuster| ,  |Steven_Spielberg|Steven_Spielberg|  and  |George_Lucas|George_Lucas|  have criticized the current Hollywood system of gambling everything on the opening weekend of these productions. Geoffrey Macnab of  The Independent  instead suggests that Hollywood look to capitalize on cult films, which have exploded in popularity on the internet.  The rise of  |social_media|Social_Media|  has been a boon to cult films. Sites such as  |Twitter|Twitter|  have displaced traditional venues for fandom and courted controversy from cultural critics who are unamused by campy cult films.  After a clip from one of his films went  |viral|Viral_Video| , director-producer  |Roger_Corman|Roger_Corman|  made a distribution deal with  |YouTube|Youtube| .   |Found_footage|Found_Footage|  which had originally been distributed as cult VHS collections eventually went viral on YouTube, which opened them to new generations of fans.  Films such as  Birdemic  and  The Room  gained quick, massive popularity, as prominent members of social networking sites discussed them. Their rise as instant cult classics bypasses the years of obscurity that most cult films labor under.  In response, critics have described the use of  |viral_marketing|Viral_Marketing|  as  |astroturfing|Astroturfing|  and an attempt to manufacture cult films.      I. Q. Hunter identifies a prefabricated cult film style which includes deliberately, insulting bad films , slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation , and mainstream films that sell themselves as worth obsessing over . Writing for  |NPR|Npr| , Scott Tobias states that  |Don_Coscarelli|Don_Coscarelli| , whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm. Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as trying too hard to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness.  Influenced by the successful online hype of  The Blair Witch Project  , other films have attempted to draw online cult fandom with the use of prefabricated cult appeal.  Snakes on a Plane  is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans. Uniquely, its cult following preceded the films release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be. This reached the point of  |convergence_culture|Technological_Convergenceconvergence_Culture|  when fan speculation began to impact on the films production.  Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released,  it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following. In retrospect, critic Spencer Kornhaber would call it a serendipitous novelty and a footnote to a more naive era of the Internet .  However, it became influential in both marketing  and titling.  This trend of instant cult classics which are hailed yet fail to attain a lasting following is described by Matt Singer, who states that the phrase is an oxymoron.      Cult films are often approached in terms of  |auteur_theory|Auteur_Theory| , which states that the directors creative vision drives a film. This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics.  Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a directors creative vision are likely to accept it as cult. According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism. Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship. By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans. Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream.  Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs. This may take the place of – and even ignore – political readings of the director. Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture. While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation. Someone like  |George_Romero|George_Romero| , whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.
