The northern and western portions are administered by Pakistan and comprise three areas: Azad Kashmir, Gilgit, and Baltistan, ... The southern and southeastern portions constitute the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian- and Pakistani-administered portions are divided by a “line of control” agreed to in 1972, although neither country recognizes it as an international boundary. In addition, China became active in the eastern area of Kashmir in the 1950s and since 1962 has controlled the northeastern part of Ladakh .  Quote: The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades.   Since Indias partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought three wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part. Today it remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. China administers parts of the territory.

Rafiqi states:         |Rinchan|Rinchan| , from  |Ladakh|Ladakh| , and Lankar Chak, from  |Dard|Dardic_People|  territory near  |Gilgit|Gilgit| , came to Kashmir and played a notable role in the subsequent political history of the Valley. All the three men were granted  |Jagirs|Jagir|  by the King.  |Rinchan|Rinchan|  became the ruler of Kashmir for three years.     Shah Mir was the first ruler of the  |Shah_Mir_dynasty|Shah_Mir_Dynasty| , which was established in 1339. Muslim  |ulama|Ulama| , such as  |Mir_Sayyid_Ali_Hamadani|Mir_Sayyid_Ali_Hamadani| , arrived from Central Asia to proselytize in Kashmir and their efforts converted thousands of Kashmiris to Islam  and Hamadanis son also convinced  |Sikander_Butshikan|Sikandar_Butshikan|  to enforce Islamic law. By the late 1400s most Kashmiris had accepted Islam.  Persian was introduced in Kashmir by the Šāh-Miri dynasty and started to flourish under Sultan Zayn-al-ʿĀbedin .           The  |Mughal|Mughal_Empire| |_padishah|Padishah| |_Akbar|Akbar|  conquered Kashmir from 1585–86, taking advantage of Kashmirs internal Sunni-Shia divisions,  and thus ended indigenous Kashmiri Muslim rule.  Akbar added it to the  |Kabul_Subah|History_Of_Afghanistanmughals_2C_Uzbeks_And_Safavids|  , but  |Shah_Jahan|Shah_Jahan|  carved it out as a separate  |subah|Subah|  with its seat at  |Srinagar|Srinagar| . Kashmir became the northern-most region of Mughal India as well as a pleasure ground in the summertime. They built Persian water-gardens in Srinagar, along the shores of  |Dal_Lake|Dal_Lake| , with cool and elegantly proportioned terraces, fountains, roses, jasmine and rows of chinar trees.        The Afghan  |Durrani_dynastys|Durrani_Dynasty| |_Durrani_Empire|Durrani_Empire|  controlled Kashmir from 1751, when 15th Mughal  |padshah|Padishah| |Ahmad_Shah_Bahadurs|Ahmad_Shah_Bahadur|  viceroy Muin-ul-Mulk was defeated and reinstated by the Durrani founder  |Ahmad_Shah_Durrani|Ahmad_Shah_Durrani|  , until the 1820 Sikh triumph.

As the Kashmiris had suffered under the Afghans, they initially welcomed the new Sikh rulers.  However, the Sikh governors turned out to be hard taskmasters, and Sikh rule was generally considered oppressive,  protected perhaps by the remoteness of Kashmir from the capital of the Sikh Empire in Lahore.  The Sikhs enacted a number of anti-Muslim laws, which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter, closing down the  |Jamia_Masjid|Jamia_Masjid_Srinagar|  in Srinagar, and banning the  |adhan|Adhan| , the public Muslim call to prayer. Kashmir had also now begun to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs.  High taxes, according to some contemporary accounts, had depopulated large tracts of the countryside, allowing only one-sixteenth of the cultivable land to be cultivated. Many Kashmiri peasants migrated to the plains of the Punjab.  However, after a famine in 1832, the Sikhs reduced the land tax to half the produce of the land and also began to offer interest-free loans to farmers; Kashmir became the second highest revenue earner for the Sikh Empire. During this time  |Kashmiri_shawls|Pashmina|  became known worldwide, attracting many buyers, especially in the West.     The  |state_of_Jammu|Jammu_District| , which had been on the ascendant after the decline of the Mughal Empire, came under the sway of the Sikhs in 1770. Further in 1808, it was fully conquered by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Gulab Singh, then a youngster in the House of Jammu, enrolled in the Sikh troops and, by distinguishing himself in campaigns, gradually rose in power and influence. In 1822, he was anointed as the Raja of Jammu. Along with his able general  |Zorawar_Singh_Kahluria|Zorawar_Singh_Kahluria| , he conquered and subdued  |Rajouri|Rajouri_District|  ,  |Kishtwar|Kishtwar_District|  , Suru valley and  |Kargil|Kargil_District|  ,  |Ladakh|Leh_District|  , and  |Baltistan|Baltistan|  , thereby surrounding the  |Kashmir_Valley|Kashmir_Valley| . He became a wealthy and influential noble in the Sikh court.               In 1845, the  |First_Anglo_Sikh_War|First_Anglo_Sikh_War|  broke out. According to  The Imperial Gazetteer of India :     Gulab Singh contrived to hold himself aloof till the battle of Sobraon , when he appeared as a useful mediator and the trusted advisor of Sir  |Henry_Lawrence|Henry_Montgomery_Lawrence| . Two treaties were concluded. By the first the State of Lahore  handed over to the British, as equivalent for one crore indemnity, the hill countries between the rivers Beas and Indus; by the second the British made over to Gulab Singh for 75 lakhs all the hilly or mountainous country situated to the east of the Indus and the west of the Ravi i.e. the  |Vale_of_Kashmir|Kashmir_Valley| |incely_sta|Incely_Sta| as it was first calledpossibly due to their secular nature |ion_territo|Ion_Territo| in Pakistan2007Northern Areas and KashmirJammu and KashmirAksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract10  |lakhs|Lakh|  74.16%23.72%0.89%1.21%implying 935 othersi.e. 5.24%0.94%or 90.87% of the Hindu population of the princely state186,000167,00048,00093,00075.94%22.06%1%1.16%which as a result of the second world war, was estimated from the 1931 census75.97%20.48%1.39%1846–1947landof 19501.5 to 190,000200,000300,000 exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the cashmere goat and increased competition from China .
