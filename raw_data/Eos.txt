     In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| , Eos  is a  |Titaness|Titan|  and the  |goddess|Goddess| |_Lycophron|Lycophron|  calls her by an archaic name, Tito . Kerenyi observes that Tito shares a linguistic origin with Eoss lover  |Tithonus|Tithonus| , which belonged to an older, pre-Greek language. of the  |dawn|Dawn| , who rose each morning from her home at the edge of the  |Oceanus|Oceanus| .       The  |Proto_Greek|Proto_Greek_Language|  form of Ἠώς / Ēṓs has been reconstructed as ἀυhώς / auhṓs, and in  |Mycenaean_Greek|Mycenaean_Greek|  as hāwōs.  According to  |Robert_S_P_Beekes|Robert_S_P_Beekes| , the initial aspiration could be due to  |metathesis|Metathesis| . It is cognate to the  |Vedic|Vedic|  goddess  Ushas ,  |Lithuania|Culture_Of_Lithuania| n goddess  Aušrinė , and  |Roman|Ancient_Roman_Religion|  goddess  Aurora  , all three of whom are also goddesses of the dawn.     All four are considered derivatives of the  |Proto_Indo_European|Proto_Indo_European_Language|  stem h₂ewsṓs , dawn . The root also gave rise to  |Proto_Germanic|Proto_Germanic|  Austrō,  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German|  Ōstara and  |Old_English|Old_English|   Ēostre / Ēastre. This  |cognate|Cognate|  keening leads to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess,  |Hausos|Hausos|  .   |R_S_P_Beekes|Robert_S_P_Beekes| , Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 492.

Eos had just shaken off the wing of carefree sleep and opened the gates of sunrise, leaving the lightbringing couch of Kephalos .  . In  |Homer|Homer| , Homer, Iliad viii.1 & xxiv.695 her  |saffron_coloured|Saffron|  robe is embroidered or woven with flowers; Odyssey vi:48 etc rosy-fingered and with golden arms, she is pictured on  |Attic_vases|Attic_Vase|  as a beautiful woman, crowned with a  |tiara|Tiara|  or  |diadem|Diadem|  and with the large white-feathered wings of a bird.       From The Iliad  |Oceanus|Oceanus| , to bring light to mortals and immortals,  |Thetis|Thetis|  reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her.  |Homer|Homer| ,  Iliad  xix.1   : But soon as early Dawn appeared, the  |rosy|Rose| -fingered, then gathered the folk about the  |pyre|Pyre|  of glorious  |Hector|Hector| . Homer, Iliad xxiv.776     She is most often associated with her Homeric  |epithet|Epithet|  rosy-fingered , but Homer also calls her Eos Erigeneia |Eosphoros|Eosphorus| , that most often heralds the light of early-rising Dawn . Homer,  Odyssey  xiii.93         : And after these Erigeneia bore the star  |Eosphoros|Eosphoros|  , and the gleaming stars with which heaven is crowned. Hesiod, Theogony 378-382     Thus Eos, preceded by the  |Morning_Star|Phosphorus| , is seen as the genetrix of all the stars and planets; her tears are considered to have created the morning dew,  |personified|Personification|  as  |Ersa|Ersa|  or  |Herse|Herse| . Ovid, Metamorphoses 13.621-2       Eos team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the  Odyssey  as Firebright and Daybright . While  |Quintus|Quintus_Smyrnaeus|  described her exulting in her heart over the radiant horses  that drew her chariot, amidst the bright-haired  |Horae|Horae| , the feminine Hours, climbing the arc of heaven and scattering sparks of fire. Quintus Smyrnaeus, Posthomerica i.48              Eos fell in love several times. According to  |Pseudo_Apollodorus|Pseudo_Apollodorus| , it was the jealous Aphrodite who cursed her to be perpetually in love and have an unsatisfiable sexual desire because once had Eos lain with Aphrodites sweetheart Ares, the god of war. Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.4.4 This caused her to abduct a number of handsome young men, most notably  |Cephalus|Cephalus_Of_Athens| ,  |Tithonus|Tithonus| ,  |Orion|Orion| , and  |Cleitus|Cleitus| . The good-looking Cleitus was made immortal by her. Homer, Odyssey 15.249 ff She also asked for Tithonus to be made immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal youth, which resulted in him living forever as a helpless old man. Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, 318 ff Out of pity, she turned into a  |cicada|Cicada| .     According to Hesiod, by Tithonus, Eos had two sons,  |Memnon|Memnon|  and  |Emathion|Emathion| . Hesiod, Theogony 984ff Memnon fought among the Trojans in the  |Trojan_War|Trojan_War|  and was slain. Her image with the dead Memnon across her knees, like  |Thetis|Thetis|  with the dead  |Achilles|Achilles|  are  |icons|Icon|  that inspired the Christian  |Pietà|Pietà|  .     The abduction of Cephalus had special appeal for an Athenian audience because Cephalus was a local boy, Mary R. Lefkowitz, Predatory Goddesses Hesperia 71.4 p. 326. and so this myth element appeared frequently in Attic vase-paintings and was exported with them. In the literary myths, Eos kidnapped  |Cephalus|Cephalus|  when he was hunting and took him to Syria. Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.14.3 Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 1.3.1 Hyginus, Fabulae 189 Ovid, Metamorphoses vii.703 ff     The second-century CE traveller Pausanias was informed that the abductor of Cephalus was  |Hemera|Hemera| , goddess of Day. Pausanias remarking on the subjects shown in the Royal Stoa, Athens and on the throne of Apollo at Amyklai . Although Cephalus was already married to  |Procris|Procris| , Eos bore him three sons, including  |Phaeton|Phaethon|  and  |Hesperus|Hesperus| , but he then began pining for Procris, causing a disgruntled Eos to return him to her and put a curse on them.     In Hyginus report, Cephalus accidentally killed Procris some time later after he mistook her for an animal while hunting.     In Ovids account, Procris, a jealous wife, was spying on him and heard him singing to the wind, but thought he was serenading his ex-lover Eos.       There are no known temples, shrines, or altars to Eos. However, Ovid seems to allude to the existence of at least two shrines of Eos, as he describes them in plural, albeit few, in the lines:   : ‘Least I may be of all the goddesses the golden heavens hold – in all the world my shrines are rarest.’ Ovid, Metamorphoses 13.576 ff     Ovid may therefore have known of at least two such shrines.           Among the Etruscans, the generative dawn-goddess was  |Thesan|Thesan| . Depictions of the dawn-goddess with a young lover became popular in Etruria in the fifth century, probably inspired by imported Greek vase-painting. Marilyn Y. Goldberg, The Eos and Kephalos from Cære: Its Subject and Date American Journal of Archæology 91.4 p 607. Though Etruscans preferred to show the goddess as a nurturer  rather than an abductor of young men, the late Archaic sculptural  |acroterion|Acroterion|  from Etruscan Cære, now in Berlin, showing the goddess in archaic running pose adapted from the Greeks, and bearing a boy in her arms, has commonly been identified as Eos and  |Cephalus|Cephalus| . Goldberg 1987:605-614 casts doubt on the boys identification, in the context of Etruscan and Greek abduction motifs. On an Etruscan mirror Thesan is shown carrying off a young man, whose name is inscribed as Tinthu. Noted by Goldberg 1987: in I. Mayer-Prokop, Die gravierten etruskischen Griffspiegel archaischen Stils 1966, fig. 61.            The  |Roman|Roman_Mythology|  equivalent of Eos is  |Aurora|Aurora| , also a cognate showing the characteristic  |Latin|Latin| |_rhotacism|Rhotacism_Latin| . Dawn became associated in Roman cult with Matuta, later known as  |Mater_Matuta|Mater_Matuta| . She was also associated with the sea harbors and ports, and had a temple on the  |Forum_Boarium|Forum_Boarium| . On June 11, the  |Matralia|Matralia| .
