However, legal disputes made the amount of any payment uncertain.     After a few months in London, he began to seem more like his former self again. In September 1713 he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in Bristol and may have been kept in confinement for two years. He returned to Lower Largo, where he met Sophia Bruce, a young dairymaid. They eloped to London early in 1717 but apparently did not marry. He was soon off to sea again, having enlisted in the Royal Navy . While on a visit to Plymouth in 1720, he married a widowed innkeeper named Frances Candis. He was serving as masters mate on board , engaged in an anti- piracy patrol off the west coast of Africa, when he died on 13 December 1721, succumbing to the yellow fever that plagued the voyage.

An illustration on the first page of the novel shows a rather melancholy-looking man standing on the shore of an island, gazing inland , in the words of modern explorer Tim Severin . He is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins, his feet and shins bare. Yet Crusoes island is located not in the mid-latitudes of the South Pacific but away in the Caribbean , where the furry attire would hardly be comfortable in the tropical heat. This incongruity supports the popular belief that Selkirk was a model for the fictional character, though most literary scholars now accept that his was just one of many survival narratives that Defoe knew about .       thu   William Cowper s The Solitude Of Alexander Selkirk is about Selkirks feelings as the castaway lived all alone on the island. This poem gave rise to the common phrase monarch of all I survey via the verse:   :::I am monarch of all I survey,   :::My right there is none to dispute;   :::From the centre all round to the sea,   :::I am lord of the fowl and the brute.
