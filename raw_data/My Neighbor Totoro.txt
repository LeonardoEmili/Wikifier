In  |1958_Japan|1958_In_Japan| , university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, move into an old house to be closer to the hospital where the girls mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by tiny creatures called  susuwatari —small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places. The susuwatari are called black soots in early subtitles and soot sprites in the later English dubbed version. When the girls become comfortable in their new house, the soot spirits leave to find another empty house.     One day, Mei discovers two small spirits who lead her into the hollow of a large  |camphor_tree|Cinnamomum_Camphora| . She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as Totoro . She falls asleep atop Totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei is unable to show her family Totoros tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.     One rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuos bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsukis back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken for her father. Totoro is delighted and gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A  |giant_bus_shaped_cat|Catbus|  halts at the stop and Totoro boards it and leaves. Shortly after, Tatsuos bus arrives.     The girls plant the seeds. A few days later, they awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his colleagues engaged in a  |ceremonial_dance|Ceremonial_Dance|  around the planted seeds. The girls join in and the seeds grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying  |top|Top| . In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have indeed sprouted; it is left unclear whether the girls were dreaming.     The girls find out that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei does not take this well, and argues with Satsuki, later leaving for the hospital to bring fresh corn to Yasuko. Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the  |camphor_tree|Cinnamomum_Camphora|  and pleads for Totoros help. Delighted to help, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. The bus then whisks them over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls overhear a conversation between their parents and discover that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where it is discovered by their parents, and return home.     Eventually, Mei and Satsukis mother returns home, and the sisters play with other children, while Totoro and his friends watch them from afar.               |Art_director|Art_Director| |_Kazuo_Oga|Kazuo_Oga|  was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a  |satoyama|Satoyama| . The director challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Ogas experience with My Neighbor Totoro jump-started the artists career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the palette of the film, Oga seeking to paint black soil from  |Akita_Prefecture|Akita_Prefecture|  and Miyazaki preferring the color of red soil from the  |Kantō_region|Kantō_Region| .  The ultimate product was described by  |Studio_Ghibli|Studio_Ghibli|  producer Toshio Suzuki: It was nature painted with translucent colors.      Ogas conscientious approach to My Neighbor Totoro was a style that the International Herald Tribune recognized as the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive . The newspaper described the final product:      Ogas work on My Neighbor Totoro led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli. The studio assigned jobs to Oga that would play to his strengths, and Ogas style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.      In several of Miyazakis initial conceptual  |watercolors|Watercolor_Painting| , as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home video releases, only one young girl is depicted, rather than two sisters. According to Miyazaki, If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldnt be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult. The opening sequence of the film was not storyboarded, Miyazaki said. The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the  |time_sheets|Exposure_Sheet| . Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets...   The ending sequence depicts the mothers return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.      The storyboard depicts the town of Matsuko as the setting, with the year being 1955; Miyazaki stated that it was not exact and the team worked on a setting in the recent past .  The film was originally set to be an hour long, but throughout the process it grew to respond to the social context including the reason for the move and the fathers occupation.      Miyazaki has said that Totoro is not a spirit: hes only an animal. I believe he lives on acorns. Hes supposedly the forest keeper, but thats only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation.  The character of Mei was modeled on Miyazakis niece.        After writing and filming  Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind  and  Castle in the Sky  , Hayao Miyazaki began directing My Neighbor Totoro for  |Studio_Ghibli|Studio_Ghibli| . Miyazakis production paralleled his colleague  |Isao_Takahatas|Isao_Takahata|  production of  Grave of the Fireflies . Miyazakis film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both My Neighbor Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience .        In Japan, My Neighbor Totoro sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution income of  in 1988. The film went on to gross a total box office revenue of  in Japan, as of 2006.  Overseas, My Neighbor Totoro has received international releases since 2002  .
