The  |prehistory_of_the_Americas|Prehistory_Of_The_Americas|   begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia during the height of an  |Ice_Age|Ice_Age| . These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from the people of the  |Old_World|Old_World|  until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Iceland led by  |Leif_Erikson|Leif_Erikson|  and with the  |voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus|Voyages_Of_Christopher_Columbus|  in 1492.     The ancestors of todays  |American_Indigenous_peoples|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  were the  |Paleo_Indians|Paleo_Indians| ; they were  |hunter_gatherers|Hunter_Gatherer|  who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the  |Americas|Americas|  via  |Beringia|Beringia| , the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the  |Bering_Strait|Bering_Strait| . Small  |lithic_stage|Lithic_Stage|  peoples followed  |megafauna|Megafauna|  like bison, mammoth , and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname big-game hunters. Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.     Cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as  |Iroquois|Iroquois|  on North America and  |Pirahã|Pirahã_People|  of South America. These cultures later developed into  |civilizations|Civilization| . In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts. Cultures that may be considered advanced or civilized include  |Norte_Chico|Norte_Chico_Civilization| ,  |Cahokia|Cahokia| ,  |Zapotec|Zapotec_Civilization| ,  |Toltec|Toltec| ,  |Olmec|Olmec| ,  |Maya|Maya_Civilization| ,  |Aztec|Aztec| ,  |Chimor|Chimor| ,  |Mixtec|Mixtec| ,  |Moche|Moche| ,  |Mississippian|Mississippian_Culture| ,  |Puebloan|Puebloan| ,  |Totonac|Totonac| ,  |Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan| ,  |Huastec_people|Huastec_People| ,  |Purépecha|Purépecha_People| ,  |Izapa|Izapa| ,  |Mazatec|Mazatec_People| ,  |Muisca|Muisca_People| , and the  |Inca|Inca| .After the  |voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus|Voyages_Of_Christopher_Columbus|  in 1492,  |Spanish|Spanish_Empire|  and later  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Empire| ,  |English|British_Empire| ,  |French|French_Colonial_Empire|  and  |Dutch|Dutch_Empire|  colonial expeditions arrived in the New World, conquering and settling the discovered lands, which led to a transformation of the cultural and physical landscape in the Americas. Spain colonized most of the Americas from present-day  |Southwestern_United_States|Southwestern_United_States| ,  |Florida|Florida|  and the  |Caribbean|Caribbean|  to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day  |Brazil|Brazil|  while England established colonies on the  |Eastern_coast_of_the_United_States|Thirteen_Colonies| , as well as the  |North_Pacific_coast|Northwestern_United_States|  and in most of  |Canada|Canada| . France settled in  |Quebec|Quebec|  and other parts of Eastern  |Canada|Canada|  and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland , some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.     European colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of Native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The transformation of American cultures through colonization is evident in architecture, religion, gastronomy, the arts and particularly languages, the most widespread being  |Spanish|Spanish_Language|  ,  |English|English_Language|  and  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Language|  . The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when  |Brazil|Brazil|  and the larger  |Hispanic_America|Hispanic_America| n nations declared independence. The  |United_States|United_States|  obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as  |Cuba|Cuba|  and  |Puerto_Rico|Puerto_Rico|  which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as  |Guyana|Guyana|  obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and  |French_Guiana|French_Guiana|  remain part of a European power to this day.                          The specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion.    The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the  |Beringia_land_bridge|Beringia|  between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 – 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the  |Quaternary_glaciation|Quaternary_Glaciation| .  These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct  |Pleistocene|Pleistocene| |_megafauna|Megafauna|  along ice-free corridors that stretched between the  |Laurentide|Laurentide_Ice_Sheet|  and  |Cordilleran|Cordilleran_Ice_Sheet|  ice sheets.  Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using  |primitive_boats|Boathistory| , they migrated down the  |Pacific_Northwest|Pacific_Northwest|  coast to South America.  Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a  |sea_level_rise|Sea_Level_Rise|  of a hundred meters following the last ice age.      Archaeologists contend that the Paleo-Indian migration out of Beringia , ranges from 40,000 to around 16,500 years ago.    This time range is a hot source of debate. The few agreements achieved to date are the origin from  |Central_Asia|Central_Asia| , with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the  |last_glacial_period|Last_Glacial_Period| , or more specifically what is known as the  |late_glacial_maximum|Late_Glacial_Maximumnorth_America| , around 16,000 – 13,000 years before present.      The  |American_Journal_of_Human_Genetics|American_Journal_Of_Human_Genetics|  released an article in 2007 stating Here we show, by using 86 complete  |mitochondrial|Mitochondrial| |_genomes|Genomes| , that all Indigenous American  |haplogroups|Haplogroups| , including  |Haplogroup_X_|Haplogroup_X| , were part of a single founding population.  Amerindian groups in the Bering Strait region exhibit perhaps the strongest DNA or mitochondrial DNA relations to  |Siberian_peoples|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_Siberia| . The genetic diversity of Amerindian indigenous groups increase with distance from the assumed entry point into the Americas.   Certain genetic diversity patterns from West to East suggest, particularly in South America, that migration proceeded first down the west coast, and then proceeded eastward.  Geneticists have variously estimated that peoples of Asia and the Americas were part of the same population from 42,000 to 21,000 years ago.      New studies shed light on the founding population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal  |Nature|Nature|  reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young boy in Mal’ta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that can be traced back to western Eurasians, who may have had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought  Professor Kelly Graf said that Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day Native Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia. A route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the  |Solutrean_hypothesis|Solutrean_Hypothesis| .      On October 3, 2014, the  |Oregon|Oregon|  cave where the oldest  |DNA|Dna|  evidence of  |human|Human|  habitation in  |North_America|North_America|  was found was added to the  |National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National_Register_Of_Historic_Places| . The DNA,  |radiocarbon_dated|Radiocarbon_Dating|  to 14,300 years ago, was found in fossilized human  |coprolites|Coprolites|  uncovered in the  |Paisley_Five_Mile_Point_Caves|Paisley_Five_Mile_Point_Caves|  in south central Oregon.                 The  |Lithic_stage|Lithic_Stage|  or  Paleo-Indian period , is the earliest classification term referring to the first stage of human habitation in the Americas, covering the  |Late_Pleistocene|Late_Pleistocene|  epoch. The time period derives its name from the appearance of  |Lithic_flake|Lithic_Flake| d stone tools.  |Stone_tools|Stone_Tool| , particularly  |projectile_points|Projectile_Point|  and  |scrapers|Scraper| , are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the  |Americas|Americas| .  |Lithic_reduction|Lithic_Reduction|  stone tools are used by  |archaeologists|Archaeologists|  and  |anthropologists|Anthropologist|  to classify cultural periods.          Several thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle  |Archaic_period|Archaic_Stage|  around 6000 BCE. Particular  |archaeological_cultures|Archaeological_Culture|  can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.     In the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the  |Norte_Chico_civilization|Norte_Chico_Civilization| , also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the  |five_sites|Cradle_Of_Civilization|  where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican  |Olmec|Olmec|  civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under  |Narmer|Narmer|  and the emergence of the first  |Egyptian_hieroglyphics|Egyptian_Hieroglyphics| .     Monumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.     Ongoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.     The role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico,  |Michael_E_Moseley|Michael_E_Moseley|  contended that a maritime subsistence economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed maritime foundation of Andean Civilization was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa and southwest Asia .     While earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as  |squash|Squash| ,  |beans|Beans| ,  |lucuma|Lucuma| ,  |guava|Guava| ,  |pacay|Pacay| , and  |camote|Camote|  at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added  |avocado|Avocado| ,  |achira|Canna| , and  |corn|Corn|  to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.       |Cotton|Cotton|  was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish.     In the 2005 book  1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus , journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at  |Huaricanga|Huaricanga|  in the Fortaleza area.     The Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.             After the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere:  |Chavin|Chavín_Culture| ,  |Nazca|Nazca| ,  |Moche|Moche| ,  |Huari|Huari_Culture| ,  |Quitus|Quitus| ,  |Cañaris|Cañari| ,  |Chimu|Chimu| ,  |Pachacamac|Pachacamac| ,  |Tiahuanaco|Tiahuanaco| ,  |Aymara|Aymara_People|  and  |Inca|Inca|  in the Central  |Andes|Andes|  ;  |Muisca|Muisca_People|  in Colombia ;  |Taínos|Taínos|  in Dominican Republic and part of Caribbean; and the  |Olmecs|Olmec| ,  |Maya|Maya_Civilization| ,  |Toltecs|Toltec| ,  |Mixtecs|Mixtec| ,  |Zapotecs|Zapotec_Civilization| ,  |Aztecs|Aztec|  and  |Purepecha|Purépecha_People|  in southern North America .     The  |Olmec|Olmec|  civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the  |six_sites|Cradle_Of_Civilization|  around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.     Some elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The  |domestication_of_maize|Maizeorigin|  is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.  Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo . La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.     The Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.     Cities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in  |Tenochtitlan|Tenochtitlan| , the capital of the  |Aztec_Empire|Aztec_Empire| . The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the  |conquistadors|Conquistador|  when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians,  |Cahokia|Cahokia| , located near modern  |East_St_Louis_Illinois|East_St_Louis_Illinois| , may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America.  |Monks_Mound|Monks_Mound| , the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.     These civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding  |maize|Maize|  from having ears 2–5  cm in length to perhaps 10–15  cm in length.  |Potato|Potato| es,  |tomato|Tomato| es,  |pumpkins|Pumpkin| ,  |beans|Bean| ,  |avocados|Avocado| , and  |chocolate|Chocolate|  are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although  |alpacas|Alpaca|  and  |llamas|Llama|  were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the  |Andes|Andes| . By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the  |Mississippi_River|Mississippi_River|  Valley after introduction from  |Mexico|Mexico| . The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of  |Europeans|European_Ethnic_Groups| .          ;Cahokia      Cahokia was a major regional  |chiefdom|Chiefdom| , with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the  |Great_Lakes|Great_Lakes|  to the  |Gulf_of_Mexico|Gulf_Of_Mexico| .     ;Haudenosaune      The  |Iroquois_League_of_Nations|Iroquois|  or People of the Long House , based in present-day upstate and western  |New_York|New_York| , had a  |confederacy|Confederation|  model from the mid-15th  century. It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies.        Leadership was restricted to a group of 50  |sachem|Sachem| |chiefs|Tribal_Chief| , each representing one  |clan|Clan|  within a tribe; the  |Oneida|Oneida_People|  and  |Mohawk_people|Mohawk_People|  had nine seats each; the  |Onondagas|Onondaga_People|  held fourteen; the  |Cayuga|Cayuga_Nation|  had ten seats; and the  |Seneca|Seneca_Nation|  had eight. Representation was not based on population numbers, as the Seneca tribe greatly outnumbered the others. When a sachem chief died, his successor was chosen by the senior woman of his tribe in consultation with other female members of the clan; property and hereditary leadership were passed  |matrilineally|Matrilineality| . Decisions were not made through voting but through consensus decision making, with each sachem chief holding theoretical  |veto_power|Veto| . The Onondaga were the  |firekeepers|Firekeeper|  , responsible for raising topics to be discussed. They occupied one side of a three-sided fire     Elizabeth Tooker, an  |anthropologist|Anthropologist| , has said that it was unlikely the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears little resemblance to the system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.     Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th  century, or in the 17th  century  |Beaver_Wars|Beaver_Wars| .      Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the  |Osage|Osage_Nation| ,  |Kaw|Kaw_People| ,  |Ponca|Ponca|  and  |Omaha_people|Omaha_People| . By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day  |Kansas|Kansas| ,  |Nebraska|Nebraska| ,  |Arkansas|Arkansas|  and  |Oklahoma|Oklahoma| . The Osage warred with  |Caddo|Caddo| -speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories.          ;Pueblo people      The  |Pueblo_people|Pueblo_People|  of what is now occupied by the  |Southwestern_United_States|Southwestern_United_States|  and northern  |Mexico|Mexico| , living conditions were that of large stone apartment like  |adobe|Adobe|  structures. They live in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, and possibly surrounding areas.             ;Chichimeca        Chichimeca was the name that the  |Mexica|Aztec|  generically applied to a wide range of semi- |nomad|Nomad| ic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day  |Mexico|Mexico| , and carried the same sense as the European term  |barbarian|Barbarian|  . The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic  |hunter_gatherer|Hunter_Gatherer|  peoples of northern Mexico.            ;Zapotec   The  |Zapotec|Zapotec_Civilization|  emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city  |Monte_Alban|Monte_Alban| .     ;Olmec   The  |Olmec|Olmec|  civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in  |Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica|  and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.     ;Purepecha   The  |Purepecha|Purépecha_People|  civilization emerged around 1000 CE in  |Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica|  . They flourished from 1100 CE to 1530 CE. They continue to live on in the state of  |Michoacán|Michoacán| . Fierce warriors, they were never conquered and in their glory years, successfully sealed off huge areas from Aztec domination.     ;Maya       |Maya|Maya_Civilization|  history spans 3,000 years. The  |Classic_Maya|Classic_Maya_Collapse|  may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.     ;Toltec   The  |Toltec|Toltec|  were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.     ;Teotihuacan    |Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan|  was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.     ;Aztec   The  |Aztec|Aztec|  having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.               ;Norte Chico   The oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the  |Norte_Chico|Norte_Chico|  region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The  |Quipu|Quipu| , a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chicos prominence.     ;Chavín   The  |Chavín|Chavín|  established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern  |Peru|Peru|  at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chavín civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.     ; |Inca|Inca|    Holding their capital at the great city of  |Cusco|Cusco| , the  |Inca_civilization|Inca_Civilization|  dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.   Known as Tahuantinsuyu, or the land of the four regions , in  |Quechua|Quechua_Languages| , the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain.  |Terrace_farming|Terrace_Farming|  was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful  |trepanation|Trepanning|  of the skull in Inca civilization.                           Around 1000, the  |Vikings|Vikings|  established a short-lived settlement in  |Newfoundland|Newfoundland| , now known as  |LAnse_aux_Meadows|Lanse_Aux_Meadows| . Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.     Spain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer  |Christopher_Columbus|Christopher_Columbus|  in 1492; it quickly led to extensive  |European_colonization_of_the_Americas|European_Colonization_Of_The_Americas| . The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.          15th to 19th century colonies in the New World:    |Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas|Spanish_Colonization_Of_The_Americas| |_Viceroyalty_of_New_Spain|Viceroyalty_Of_New_Spain| |_Viceroyalty_of_Peru|Viceroyalty_Of_Peru| |_Spanish_Main|Spanish_Main| |_Spanish_West_Indies|Spanish_West_Indies| |_Captaincy_General_of_Guatemala|Captaincy_General_Of_Guatemala| |_British_America|British_America|  /  |Thirteen_Colonies|Thirteen_Colonies| |_Danish_West_Indies|Danish_West_Indies| |_New_Netherland|New_Netherland| |_New_France|New_France| |_Captaincy_General_of_Venezuela|Captaincy_General_Of_Venezuela| |_Portuguese_colonization_of_the_Americas|Portuguese_Colonization_Of_The_Americas| |_Colonial_Brazil|Colonial_Brazil|           The formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the  |United_States_Declaration_of_Independence|United_States_Declaration_Of_Independence|  of 1776. The  |American_Revolutionary_War|American_Revolutionary_War|  lasted through the period of the  |Siege_of_Yorktown|Siege_Of_Yorktown|  — its last major campaign — in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved  |in_1783|Treaty_Of_Paris| .     The Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the  |Spanish_American_wars_of_independence|Spanish_American_Wars_Of_Independence| .  |Simón_Bolívar|Simón_Bolívar|  and  |José_de_San_Martín|José_De_San_Martín| , among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the  |Paraguayan_War|Paraguayan_War|  and the  |War_of_the_Pacific|War_Of_The_Pacific| .  In the Portuguese colony  |Dom_Pedro_I|Pedro_I_Of_Brazil|  , son of the Portuguese  |king|Monarch| |_Dom_João_VI|Dom_João_Vi| , proclaimed the countrys independence in 1822 and became Brazils first  |Emperor|Emperor| . This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.          Slavery has had a significant role in the economic development of the  |New_World|New_World|  after the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans. The  |cotton|Cotton| ,  |tobacco|Tobacco| , and  |sugar_cane|Sugar_Cane|  harvested by slaves became important exports for the United States and the Caribbean countries.                    As a part of the  |British_Empire|British_Empire| , Canada immediately entered World War I when it broke out in 1914. Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of  |poison_gas|Poison_Gas_In_World_War_I|  attacks at  |Ypres|Second_Battle_Of_Ypres| . Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in  |conscription|Conscription| , despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of  |French_Canadians|French_Canadians| . In the ensuing  |Conscription_Crisis_of_1917|Conscription_Crisis_Of_1917| , riots broke out on the streets of  |Montreal|Montreal| . In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the  |First_day_on_the_Somme|First_Day_On_The_Somme| .     The United States stayed out of the conflict  |until_1917|American_Entry_Into_World_War_I| , when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the  |Paris_Peace_Conference_of_1919|Paris_Peace_Conference_1919|  that shaped  |interwar|Interwar|  Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.          The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada.

The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the  |allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii| . Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the  |Gulf_of_Mexico|Gulf_Of_Mexico|  waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexicos neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a  |superpower|Superpower|  .          The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part.

However, the dominant  |New_Deal_coalition|New_Deal_Coalition|  collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| , and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as  |the_once_dominant_liberalism_weakened_and_collapsed|Modern_Liberalism_In_The_United_States| . Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of  |Pierre_Elliot_Trudeau|Pierre_Elliot_Trudeau| . In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.          Canadas  |Brian_Mulroney|Brian_Mulroney|  not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States.

Mexican presidents  |Miguel_de_la_Madrid|Miguel_De_La_Madrid| , in the early 1980s and  |Carlos_Salinas_de_Gortari|Carlos_Salinas_De_Gortari|  in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move.

Canada did not support the United States later move to  |invade_Iraq|Iraq_War| , however.     In the U.S. the  |Reagan_Era|Reagan_Era|  of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan|  in 1980.

The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969  |Football_War|Football_War|  between El Salvador and Honduras. A  |Central_American_Parliament|Central_American_Parliament|  has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from  |Panama|Panama|  and the  |Dominican_Republic|Dominican_Republic| .          In the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of  |political_prisoners|Political_Prisoner| , many of whom were tortured and/or killed .
