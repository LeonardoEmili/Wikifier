   Francisco Álvares  was a  |Portuguese|Portugal| |missionary|Missionary|  and  |explorer|Exploration| . In 1515 he traveled to Ethiopia as part of the Portuguese embassy to emperor  |Lebna_Dengel|Lebna_Dengel|  accompanied by returning  |Ethiopian_ambassador_Matheus|Mateus| . The embassy arrived only in 1520 to  |Ethiopia|Ethiopian_Empire|  where he joined long sought Portuguese envoy  |Pêro_da_Covilhã|Pêro_Da_Covilhã| . There he remained six years, returning to Lisbon in 1526-27 having written a report entitled Verdadeira Informação das Terras do Preste João das Indias .       Francisco Álvares was a chaplain-priest and almoner to King  |Manuel_I_of_Portugal|Manuel_I_Of_Portugal| . He was sent in 1515 as part of the Portuguese embassy to the nəgusä nägäst , accompanied by the  |Ethiopian_ambassador_Matheus|Mateus| . Their first attempt to reach the port of  |Massawa|Massawa|  failed due to the actions of  |Lopo_Soares_de_Albergaria|Lopo_Soares_De_Albergaria| , governor of  |Portuguese_India|Portuguese_India| , which got no closer than the  |Dahlak_Archipelago|Dahlak_Archipelago|  and was aborted with the death of the Portuguese ambassador, old  |Duarte_Galvão|Duarte_Galvão|  at  |Kamaran|Kamaran| . Álvares and Mattheus were forced to wait until the arrival of Soares replacement,  |Diogo_Lopes_de_Sequeira|Diogo_Lopes_De_Sequeira| , who successfully sent the embassy on, with Dom  |Rodrigo_de_Lima|Rodrigo_De_Lima|  replacing Duarte Galvão. The party at last reached Massawa on April 9, 1520, and reached the court of  |Lebna_Dengel|Lebna_Dengel|  where he befriended several Europeans who had gained the favor of the Emperor, which included  |Pêro_da_Covilhã|Pêro_Da_Covilhã|  and  |Nicolao_Branceleon|Brancaleon| . Father Álvares remained six years in Ethiopia, returning to  |Lisbon|Lisbon|  in either 1526 or 1527.     In 1533 he was allowed to accompany Dom  |Martinho_de_Portugal|Martinho_De_Portugal|  to  |Rome|Rome|  on an embassy to  |Pope_Clement_VII|Pope_Clement_Vii| , to whom Father Álvares delivered the letter Lebna Dengel had written to the Pope. The precise date of Francisco Álvares death, like that of his birth, is unknown, but the writer of the  |1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica|1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica|  article concludes it was later than 1540, in which year an account of his travels were published at Lisbon. In the introduction of their translation of Álvares work,  |C.F._Beckingham|C.F._Beckingham|  and  |G.W.B._Huntingford|G.W.B._Huntingford|  furnish evidence that points to Álvares death in  |Rome|Rome| , and admit that he may have died before his work was published.       In 1540,  |Luís_Rodrigues|Luís_Rodrigues|  published a version of Álvares account in a one volume folio, entitled Verdadeira Informação das Terras do Preste João das Indias . C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford cite evidence, based in part on the earlier work of Professor  |Roberto_Almagia|Roberto_Almagia| , showing that Rodriguess publication is only a part of Álvaress entire account. Another version of what Álvares wrote was included in an anthology of travel narratives, Navigationi et Viaggi assembled and published by  |Giovanni_Battista_Ramusio|Giovanni_Battista_Ramusio| , and published in 1550.  Navigationi et viaggi Almagia also identified three manuscripts in the  |Vatican_Library|Vatican_Library|  which contain versions of excerpts from the original manuscript.     Francisco Álvares work has been translated into English at least twice. The first time was the work of the  |Henry_Stanley,_3rd_Baron_Stanley_of_Alderley|Henry_Stanley,_3Rd_Baron_Stanley_Of_Alderley|  for the  |Hakluyt_Society|Hakluyt_Society|  in 1881. This translation was revised and augmented with notes by C. F. Beckingham and G. W. B. Huntingford, The Prester John of the Indies .     The author of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article was critical of the information it contained, believing it should be received with caution, as the author is prone to exaggerate, and does not confine himself to what came within his own observation. Beckingham and Huntingford, however, have a higher opinion of Álvares testimony, stating that not only is it incomparably more detailed than any earlier account of Ethiopia that has survived; it is also a very important source for Ethiopian history, for it was written just before the country was devastated by the  |Muslim_Somali|Ahmed_Gragn|  and pagan  |Galla|Oromo_People|  invasions of the second quarter of the sixteenth century. He provides the first recorded and detailed descriptions of  |Axum|Axum|  and  |Lalibela|Lalibela| . They continue...     : He is sometimes wrong, but very rarely silly or incredible. He made a few mistakes; he may well have made others that we cannot detect because he is our sole authority; when he tried to describe buildings his command of language was usually inadequate; he is often confused and obscure, though this may be as much his printers fault as his own; his prose is frequently difficult to read and painful to translate; but he seems to us to be free from the dishonesty of the traveller who tries to exaggerate his own knowledge, importance, or courage .
