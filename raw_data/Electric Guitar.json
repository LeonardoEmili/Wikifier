Electric guitars were originally designed by acoustic guitar makers and instrument manufacturers.

In the case of Gibson and PRS, these are called chambered bodies. The motivation for this may be to reduce weight, to achieve a semi-acoustic tone or both. Hunter, Dave . Gibson Lifestyle  Irizarry, Rob . Building the Ergonomic Guitar.           Semi-acoustic guitars have a hollow body and electronic pickups mounted on the body. They work in a similar way to solid-body electric guitars except that, because the hollow body also vibrates, the pickups convert a combination of string and body vibration into an electrical signal. Whereas chambered guitars are made, like solid-body guitars, from a single block of wood, semi-acoustic and full-hollowbody guitars bodies are made from thin sheets of wood. They do not provide enough acoustic volume for live performance, but they can be used unplugged for quiet practice.

The final stages of on-board sound-shaping circuitry are the volume control  and tone control . Where there are individual volume controls for different pickups, and where pickup signals can be combined, they would affect the timbre of the final sound by adjusting the balance between pickups from a straight 50:50.
