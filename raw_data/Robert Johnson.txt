           Robert Leroy Johnson  was an American  |blues|Blues|  singer, songwriter and musician. His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnsons poorly documented life and death have given rise to much legend. The one most closely associated with his life is that  |he_sold_his_soul_to_the_devil|Deal_With_The_Devil|  at a  |local_crossroads|Crossroads|  to achieve musical success. He is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly as a progenitor of the  |Delta_blues|Delta_Blues|  style.     As an  |itinerant|Wikt:Special:Search/Itinerant|  performer who played mostly on street corners, in  |juke_joints|Juke_Joint| , and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. He participated in only two recording sessions, one in  |San_Antonio|San_Antonio|  in 1936, and one in  |Dallas|Dallas|  in 1937, that produced 29 distinct songs recorded by famed Country Music Hall of Fame producer  |Don_Law|Don_Law| . These songs, recorded at low fidelity in improvised studios, were the totality of his recorded output. Most were released as 10-inch,  |78_rpm|78_Rpm| |singles|Single|  from , with a few released after his death. Other than these recordings, very little was known of him during his life outside of the small musical circuit in the  |Mississippi_Delta|Mississippi_Delta|  where he spent most of his life; much of his story has been reconstructed after his death by researchers.     His music had a small, but influential, following during his life and in the two decades after his death. In late 1938  |John_Hammond|John_Hammond|  sought him out for a concert at  |Carnegie_Hall|Carnegie_Hall| ,  From Spirituals to Swing , only to discover that Johnson had died.  |Brunswick_Records|Brunswick_Records| , which owned the original recordings, was bought by  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records| , where Hammond was employed.  |Musicologist|Musicologist| |Alan_Lomax|Alan_Lomax|  went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson, also not knowing of his death. Law, who by then worked for Columbia Records, assembled a collection of Johnsons recordings titled  King of the Delta Blues Singers  that was released by Columbia in 1961. It is widely credited with finally bringing Johnsons work to a wider audience. The album would become influential, especially on the nascent  |British_blues|British_Blues|  movement which was just getting started at the time;  |Eric_Clapton|Eric_Clapton|  has called Johnson the most important blues singer that ever lived.  LaVere, Stephen . Booklet accompanying Complete Recordings. Sony Music Entertainment. p. 26. Musicians such as  |Bob_Dylan|Bob_Dylan| ,  |Keith_Richards|Keith_Richards| , and  |Robert_Plant|Robert_Plant|  have cited both Johnsons lyricism and musicianship as key influences on their own work. Many of Johnsons songs have been covered over the years, becoming hits for other artists, and his  |guitar_licks|Guitar_Lick|  and lyrics have been borrowed and re-purposed by many later musicians.     Renewed interest in Johnsons work and life led to a burst of scholarship starting in the 1960s. Much of what we know about him today was reconstructed by researchers such as  |Gayle_Dean_Wardlow|Gayle_Dean_Wardlow| . Two films, the 1991 documentary  The Search for Robert Johnson  by  |John_Hammond,_Jr.|John_P._Hammond| , and a 1997 documentary, Cant You Hear the Wind Howl, the Life and Music of Robert Johnson, which included reconstructed scenes with  |Keb_Mo|Keb_Mo|  as Johnson, were both attempts to document his life, and demonstrated the difficulties arising from the scant historical record and conflicting oral accounts.     Johnson was inducted into the  |Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame|Rock_And_Roll_Hall_Of_Fame|  in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, as an early influence on rock and roll. . Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. He was awarded a posthumous  |Grammy_Award|Grammy_Award|  in 1991 for  The Complete Recordings , a 1990 compilation album. His single  |Cross_Road_Blues|Cross_Road_Blues|  was inducted into the  |Grammy_Hall_of_Fame|Grammy_Hall_Of_Fame|  in 1998, and he was given a  |Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award|Grammy_Lifetime_Achievement_Award|  in 2006. In 2003,  |David_Fricke|David_Fricke|  ranked Johnson fifth in  Rolling Stone  magazines 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time .            Johnson was born in  |Hazlehurst,_Mississippi|Hazlehurst,_Mississippi| , possibly on May 8, 1911, Wardlow to Julia Major Dodds and Noah Johnson . Julia was married to Charles Dodds , a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker, with whom she had ten children. Charles Dodds had been forced by a  |lynch|Lynching_In_The_United_States|  mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners. Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert, but after two years sent the boy to  |Memphis|Memphis,_Tennessee|  to live with her husband, who had changed his name to Charles Spencer. Guralnik, pp. 10–11.     Robert rejoined his mother around 1919 in the  |Mississippi_Delta|Mississippi_Delta|  area, near  |Tunica|Tunica,_Mississippi|  and  |Robinsonville|Tunica_Resorts,_Mississippi| . They lived on the Abbay & Leatherman Plantation. . Retrieved September 25, 2018. Julias new husband, known as Dusty Willis, was 24 years her junior. Robert was remembered by some residents as Little Robert Dusty , Guralnik, p. 11. but he was registered at Tunicas Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer. In the 1920 census, he is listed as Robert Spencer, living in  |Lucas,_Arkansas|Lucas,_Arkansas| , with Will and Julia Willis. Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927. The quality of his signature on his marriage certificate Wardlow 1998, p. 201. suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background. A school friend, Willie Coffee, who was interviewed and filmed in later life, recalled that as a youth Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and  |jaw_harp|Jews_Harp| . Mugge, Robert . Hellhounds on My Trail: The Afterlife of Robert Johnson. Quoted in Wald 2004, p. 107. Coffee recalled that Robert was absent for long periods, which suggests that he may have been living and studying in Memphis. Pearson and McCulloch, p. 6.     After school, Robert adopted the surname of his natural father, signing himself as Robert Johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteen-year-old Virginia Travis in February 1929. She died in childbirth shortly after. Wald 2004, p. 108. Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher  |Robert_Mack_McCormick|Robert_Mack_Mccormick|  that this was a divine punishment for Roberts decision to sing secular songs, known as selling your soul to the Devil . McCormick believed that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a full-time blues musician. The Search for Robert Johnson, 1992 film.     Around this time, the blues musician  |Son_House|Son_House|  moved to Robinsonville, where his musical partner  |Willie_Brown|Willie_Brown|  lived. Late in life, House remembered Johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace, possibly searching for his natural father. Here he perfected the guitar style of House and learned other styles from  |Isaiah_Ike_Zimmerman|Ike_Zimmerman| . Pearson and McCulloch, p. 7. Zimmerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight. Pearson and McCulloch, p. 94.   When Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he seemed to have miraculously acquired a guitar technique. Guralnick, p. 15. House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnsons pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnsons technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.     While living in Martinsville, Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith. He married Caletta Craft in May 1931. In 1932, the couple moved to  |Clarksdale,_Mississippi|Clarksdale,_Mississippi| , in the Delta. Caletta died in childbirth, and Johnson left for a career as a walking or itinerant musician.       From 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between the cities of  |Memphis|Memphis,_Tennessee|  and  |Helena|Helena,_Arkansas| , and the smaller towns of the Mississippi Delta and neighboring regions of Mississippi and Arkansas. Pearson and McCulloch, p. 12. Gioia, p. 172. On occasion, he traveled much farther. The blues musician  |Johnny_Shines|Johnny_Shines|  accompanied him to Chicago, Texas, New York, Canada, Kentucky, and Indiana. Neff and Connor, p. 56.  |Henry_Townsend|Henry_Townsend|  shared a musical engagement with him in St. Louis. Townsend, p. 68. In many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends. Guralnik, p. 28. He did not marry again but formed some long-term relationships with women to whom he would return periodically. In other places he stayed with a woman he seduced at his first performance. Guralnik, p. 24. Gioia, p. 175. In each location, Johnsons hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere. He used different names in different places, employing at least eight distinct surnames. Gioia, pp. 172–173.     Biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him;  |Robert_Lockwood,_Jr.|Robert_Lockwood,_Jr.| , who knew him as his mothers partner;  |David_Honeyboy_Edwards|David_Honeyboy_Edwards| , whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson. Edwards, p. 100. From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts, Schroeder, p. 22. biographers have attempted to summarize Johnsons character. He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable . Guralnik, p. 29. As for his character, everyone seems to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way . Wald, p. 112. Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road. Pearson and McCulloch, p. 111.     When Johnson arrived in a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day   – and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.     Shines was 17 when he met Johnson in 1933. He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself. Shines is quoted describing Johnson in Samuel Charterss Robert Johnson     During this time Johnson established what would be a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician  |Robert_Lockwood,_Jr.|Robert_Lockwood,_Jr.|  Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them, and in most cases, he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.     In 1941,  |Alan_Lomax|Alan_Lomax|  learned from  |Muddy_Waters|Muddy_Waters|  that Johnson had performed in the area around  |Clarksdale,_Mississippi|Clarksdale,_Mississippi| . Lomax 1993 By 1959, the historian  |Samuel_Charters|Samuel_Charters|  could add only that  |Will_Shade|Will_Shade| , of the  |Memphis_Jug_Band|Memphis_Jug_Band| , remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in  |West_Memphis,_Arkansas|West_Memphis,_Arkansas| . Charters 1959 In the last year of his life, Johnson is believed to have traveled to St. Louis and possibly Illinois and then to some states in the East. In 1938,  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records|  producer  |John_H._Hammond|John_H._Hammond| , who owned some of Johnsons records, directed the record producer  |Don_Law|Don_Law|  seek out Johnson to book him for the first  |From_Spirituals_to_Swing|From_Spirituals_To_Swing|  concert at  |Carnegie_Hall|Carnegie_Hall|  in New York. On learning of Johnsons death, Hammond replaced him with  |Big_Bill_Broonzy|Big_Bill_Broonzy| , but he played two of Johnsons records from the stage.          In Jackson, Mississippi, around 1936, Johnson sought out  |H._C._Speir|H._C._Speir| , who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout. Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle, who, as a salesman for the ARC group of labels, introduced Johnson to  |Don_Law|Don_Law|  to record his first sessions in San Antonio, Texas. The recording session was held on November 23–25, 1936, in room 414 of the  |Gunter_Hotel|Gunter_Hotel|  in San Antonio, Blues Wizards S.A. Legacy . San Antonio Express-News. November 30, 1986. p. 1-J. which Brunswick Records had set up to be a temporary recording studio. In the ensuing three-day session, Johnson played 16 selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them. He reportedly performed facing the wall, which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer. This conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the 1961 album  King of the Delta Blues Singers . The  |slide_guitarist|Slide_Guitarist| |Ry_Cooder|Ry_Cooder|  speculates that Johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar, a technique he calls corner loading . Ry Cooder quoted in Guitar Player magazine, September 1990, p69, in article The Real Robert Johnson by Jas Obrecht     Among the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were  |Come_On_in_My_Kitchen|Come_On_In_My_Kitchen|  ,  |Kind_Hearted_Woman_Blues|Kind_Hearted_Woman_Blues|  ,  |I_Believe_Ill_Dust_My_Broom|Dust_My_Broom|  and  |Cross_Road_Blues|Cross_Road_Blues|  . The first to be released were  |Terraplane_Blues|Terraplane_Blues|  and Last Fair Deal Gone Down , probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear. Terraplane Blues became a modest regional hit, selling 5,000 copies.     His first recorded song, Kind Hearted Woman Blues , was part of a cycle of spin-offs and response songs that began with  |Leroy_Carrs|Leroy_Carr|  Mean Mistreater Mama . According to  |Elijah_Wald|Elijah_Wald| , it was the most musically complex in the cycle Wald 2004, p. 131. and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric, rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses. Wald 2004, pp. 132– 176. In contrast to most Delta players, Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78-rpm side. Wald 2004, p. 132. Most of Johnsons somber and introspective songs and performances come from his second recording session. Wald 2004, p. 167.     Johnson traveled to  |Dallas|Dallas| , Texas, for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the  |Vitagraph|Vitagraph|  Building, at 508 Park Avenue,  on June 19–20, 1937 where Brunswick Record Corporation was located on the third floor. Eric Clapton  – Sessions for Robert Johnson. Documentary, 2004. Worleys Dallas City Directory, 1937. Eleven records from this session would be released within the following year. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs, and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this, there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his time and place. Wald 2004, p. 130. Johnson recorded almost half of the 29 songs that make up his entire discography in Dallas.       Johnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near  |Greenwood,_Mississippi|Greenwood,_Mississippi| , of unknown causes. His death was not reported publicly; he merely disappeared from the historical record and it was not until almost 30 years later, when  |Gayle_Dean_Wardlow|Gayle_Dean_Wardlow| , a Mississippi-based  |musicologist|Musicologist|  researching Johnsons life, found his death certificate, which listed only the date and location, with no official cause of death. No formal autopsy was done, as a dead black man found by the side of the road near a farm, a  |pro_forma|Pro_Forma|  examination was done to file the death certificate, and no immediate cause of death was determined. It is likely he had  |congenital_syphilis|Congenital_Syphilis|  and it was suspected later by medical professionals that may have been a contributing factor in his death. However, 30 years of local legend and oral tradition had, like the rest of his life story, built a legend which has filled in gaps in the scant historical record.      Several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death. Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about  from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician  |Sonny_Boy_Williamson|Sonny_Boy_Williamson_Ii| , Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, and she gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked it out of his hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, Dont ever knock a bottle out of my hand. Soon after, he was offered another bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened. Witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain. The  |musicologist|Musicology| |Robert_Mack_McCormick|Robert_Mack_Mccormick|  claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but he declined to reveal the mans name.     While  |strychnine|Strychnine|  has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson, at least one scholar has disputed the notion. Tom Graves, in his book Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson, relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in strong liquor. Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days.      The LeFlore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, years later and after conducting an investigation into Johnsons death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote a clarifying note on the back of Johnsons death certificate:          In 2006, a medical practitioner, David Connell, suggested, on the basis of photographs showing Johnsons unnaturally long fingers and one bad eye , that Johnson may have had  |Marfan_syndrome|Marfan_Syndrome| , which could have both affected his guitar playing and contributed to his death due to  |aortic_dissection|Aortic_Dissection| . . Retrieved 4 June 2019 . Retrieved 4 June 2019          The exact location of Johnsons grave is officially unknown; three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside Greenwood.   Research in the 1980s and 1990s strongly suggests Johnson was buried in the graveyard of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church near Morgan City, Mississippi, not far from Greenwood, in an unmarked grave. A one-ton  |cenotaph|Cenotaph|  in the shape of an obelisk, listing all of Johnsons song titles, with a central inscription by  |Peter_Guralnick|Peter_Guralnick| , was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the  |Mt._Zion_Memorial_Fund|Mt._Zion_Memorial_Fund| .   In 1990, a small marker with the epitaph Resting in the Blues was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel, near Quito, Mississippi, by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones, after they saw a photograph in Living Blues magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnsons ex-girlfriends to be Johnsons burial site. Cheseborough, Steve . Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues. University Press of Mississippi. pp. 145–146. .   More recent research by Stephen LaVere Pearson and McCulloch, p. 117. indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the Little Zion Church, north of Greenwood along Money Road. Through LaVere, Sony Music placed a marker at this site, which bears LaVeres name as well as Johnsons.     John Hammond, Jr., in the documentary  The Search for Robert Johnson  , suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a paupers grave  very near where he died.       According to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician. He was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near  |Dockery_Plantation|Dockery_Plantation|  at midnight. There he was met by a large black man who took the guitar and tuned it. The Devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument. This story of a deal with the Devil at the crossroads mirrors the legend of  |Faust|Faust| . In exchange for his soul, Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.       This legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by  |Gayle_Dean_Wardlow|Gayle_Dean_Wardlow| , Wardlow, pp. 196–201. Edward Komara Wardlow, pp. 203–204. and Elijah Wald, who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnsons rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death. Wald, pp. 265–276.  |Son_House|Son_House|  once told the story to  |Pete_Welding|Pete_Welding|  as an explanation of Johnsons astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in  Down Beat  in 1966. Whelan Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between Houses observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.     Further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by  |Greil_Marcus|Greil_Marcus|  Marcus 1975. and  |Robert_Palmer|Robert_Palmer| . Palmer 1981. Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography Crossroads, by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician  |Tommy_Johnson|Tommy_Johnson| . This story was collected from his musical associate  |Ishman_Bracey|Ishman_Bracey|  and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s. Wardlow 1998. One version of Ledell Johnsons account was published in  |David_Evanss|David_Evans|  1971 biography of Tommy Johnson, Evans 1971. and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside Houses story in the widely read Searching for Robert Johnson, by Peter Guralnick. Guralnik 1982.     In another version, Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zinnerman of  |Hazlehurst,_Mississippi|Hazlehurst,_Mississippi| , learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zinnerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young Johnson. Wardlow 1998, p. 197.  Recent research by the blues scholar  |Bruce_Conforth|Bruce_Conforth| , in  Living Blues  magazine, makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet and no one would disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed: Zimmerman was not from Hazlehurst but nearby  |Beauregard|Beauregard,_Mississippi| , and he did not practice in one graveyard, but in several in the area. Living Blues 39:1 , February 2008. pp. 68–73. Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman, who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him.     While Dockery, Hazlehurst and Beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads, there are also tourist attractions claiming to be The Crossroads in both Clarksdale and Memphis. Wardlow 1998, p. 200. Residents of  |Rosedale,_Mississippi|Rosedale,_Mississippi| , claim Johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of Highways 1 and 8 in their town, while the 1986 movie  Crossroads  was filmed in  |Beulah,_Mississippi|Beulah,_Mississippi| . The blues historian Steve Cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads, because Robert Johnson was a rambling guy .        See generally  |Crossroads_main_article,_blues_songs_section|Crossroads_Blues_Songs| .     Some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the Christian figure of Satan but also to the African trickster god  |Legba|Papa_Legba| , himself associated with crossroads. Folklorist Harry M. Hyatt wrote that, during his research in the South from 1935 to 1939, when African-Americans born in the 19th or early 20th century said they or anyone else had sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads, they had a different meaning in mind. Hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating African religious retentions surrounding Legba and the making of a deal with the so-called devil at the crossroads. Hyatt, Harry . Hoodoo–Conjuration–Witchcraft–Rootwork, Beliefs Accepted by Many Negroes and White Persons. Western Publications.          This view that the devil in Johnsons songs is derived from an African deity was disputed by the blues scholar  |David_Evans|David_Evans|  in an essay published in 1999, Demythologizing the Blues :          The musicologist  |Alan_Lomax|Alan_Lomax|  dismissed the myth, stating, In fact, every blues fiddler, banjo picker, harp blower, piano strummer and guitar framer was, in the opinion of both himself and his peers, a child of the Devil, a consequence of the black view of the European dance embrace as sinful in the extreme . Lomax, p. 365.       Johnson is considered a master of the blues, particularly of the Delta blues style.  |Keith_Richards|Keith_Richards| , of the  |Rolling_Stones|The_Rolling_Stones| , said in 1990, You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it. But according to  |Elijah_Wald|Elijah_Wald| , in his book Escaping the Delta, Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles, from raw country  |slide_guitar|Slide_Guitar|  to jazz and pop licks, and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song. Wald 2004, p. 127. His first recorded song, Kind Hearted Woman Blues , in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of  |Chicago|Chicago_Blues|  or  |St._Louis|St._Louis_Blues| , with a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement . Wald 2004, p. 133. Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. Theyre Red Hot , from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an uptown  |swing|Swing_Music|  or  |ragtime|Ragtime|  sound similar to that of the  |Harlem_Hamfats|Harlem_Hamfats| , but as Wald remarked, no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home  |Ink_Spots|Ink_Spots|  ... could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them. Wald 2004, pp. 152–154.            An important aspect of Johnsons singing was his use of  |microtonality|Microtonal_Music| . These subtle inflections of  |pitch|Pitch|  help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion.  |Eric_Clapton|Eric_Clapton|  described Johnsons music as the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice . In two takes of Me and the Devil Blues he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing. Wald 2004, pp. 178–179. The songs hip humor and sophistication is often overlooked. nerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism , wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.     Johnson is also known for using the guitar as the other vocalist in the song , a technique later perfected by  |B._B._King|B._B._King|  and his personified guitar named  |Lucille|Lucille|             Johnson mastered the guitar, being considered today one of the all-time greats on the instrument. His approach was complex and musically advanced. When  |Keith_Richards|Keith_Richards|  was first introduced to Johnsons music by his bandmate  |Brian_Jones|Brian_Jones| , he asked, Who is the other guy playing with him? , not realizing it was Johnson playing one guitar. I was hearing two guitars, and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself ,  said Richards, who later stated that Robert Johnson was like an orchestra all by himself . As for his guitar technique, its politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from hen-picking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chucka-chucka rhythm figures.       In  The Story with Dick Gordon , Bill Ferris, of  |American_Public_Media|American_Public_Media| , said, Robert Johnson I think of in the same way I think of the British  |Romantic|Romanticism|  poets,  |Keats|John_Keats|  and  |Shelley|Percy_Bysshe_Shelley| , who burned out early, who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry  ... The Blues, if anything, are deeply sexual. You know, my car doesnt run, Im gonna check my oil  ... if you dont like my apples, dont shake my tree. Every verse has sexuality associated with it.         In  The Guardian s music blog from May 2010, Jon Wilde speculated without proof that Johnsons recordings may have been accidentally speeded up when first committed to 78 or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting .  He did not give a source for this statement. Biographer  |Elijah_Wald|Elijah_Wald|  and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds, including that Johnsons extant recordings were made on five different days, spread across two years at two different studios, making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable.  In addition, fellow musicians, contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed Johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than 70 years preceding Wildes hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered.       Johnson fused approaches specific to Delta blues to those from the broader music world. The slide guitar work on Rambling on My Mind is pure Delta and Johnsons vocal there has a touch of  ... Son House rawness , but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta blues—it is more like something out of  |minstrel_show|Minstrel_Show|  music or  |vaudeville|Vaudeville| . Wald 2004, p. 139. Johnson did record versions of Preaching the Blues and Walking Blues in the older bluesmans vocal and guitar style . As with the first take of Come On in My Kitchen , the influence of Skip James is evident in Jamess Devil Got My Woman , but the lyrics rise to the level of first-rate poetry, and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output. Wald 2004, pp. 171–172.     The sad, romantic Love in Vain successfully blends several of Johnsons disparate influences. The form, including the wordless last verse, follows Leroy Carrs last hit When the Sun Goes Down ; the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song  |Blind_Lemon_Jefferson|Blind_Lemon_Jefferson|  recorded in 1926. Wald 2004, p. 183. Johnsons last recording, Milkcows Calf Blues is his most direct tribute to  |Kokomo_Arnold|Kokomo_Arnold| , who wrote Milkcow Blues and influenced Johnsons vocal style. Wald 2004, p. 184.      |From_Four_Until_Late|From_Four_Until_Late|  shows Johnsons mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the Delta. He  |croons|Crooner|  the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of  |Lonnie_Johnson|Lonnie_Johnson| , and his guitar style is more that of a  |ragtime|Ragtime| -influenced player like  |Blind_Blake|Blind_Blake| . Wald 2004, pp. 170–171, 174. Lonnie Johnsons influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual Delta style: Malted Milk and Drunken Hearted Man . Both copy the arrangement of Lonnie Johnsons Life Saver Blues . Wald 2004, p. 175. The two takes of Me and the Devil Blues show the influence of  |Peetie_Wheatstraw|Peetie_Wheatstraw| , calling into question the interpretation of this piece as the spontaneous heart-cry of a demon-driven folk artist . Wald 2004, p. 177.          Johnson has had enormous impact on music and musicians, but outside his own time and place and even the genre for which he was famous. His influence on contemporaries was much smaller, in part because he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners, in  |juke_joints|Juke_Joint| , and at Saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music. He also died young after recording only a handful of songs. Johnson, though well-traveled and admired in his performances, was little noted in his lifetime, and his records were even less appreciated.  |Terraplane_Blues|Terraplane_Blues|  , sometimes described as Johnsons only hit record, outsold his others, but was still only a minor success.     If one had asked black blues fans about Johnson in the first 20 years after his death, writes  |Elijah_Wald|Elijah_Wald| , the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled Robert who? This lack of recognition extended to black musicians: As far as the evolution of black music goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note . Wald 2004.  |Columbia_Records|Columbia_Records|  released the album  King of the Delta Blues Singers , a compilation of Johnsons recordings, in 1961, which introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he received only long after his death.       Johnsons greatest influence has been on genres of music that developed after his death:  |rock_and_roll|Rock_And_Roll|  and rock. The  |Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame|Rock_And_Roll_Hall_Of_Fame|  included four of his songs in a set of 500  they deemed to have shaped the genre:    |Sweet_Home_Chicago|Sweet_Home_Chicago| |Cross_Road_Blues|Cross_Road_Blues| |Hellhound_on_My_Trail|Hellhound_On_My_Trail| |Love_in_Vain|Love_In_Vain|      Johnson recorded these songs a decade and a half before the  |advent_of_rock_and_roll|Origins_Of_Rock_And_Roll| , dying a year or two later. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him as an early influence in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, almost a half century after his death. Marc Meyers, of the  Wall Street Journal , wrote that His Stop Breakin Down Blues from 1937 is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in 1954.       Many of the artists who claim to have been influenced by Johnson the most, injecting his revolutionary stylings into their work and recording tribute songs and collections, are prominent rock musicians from the United Kingdom. His impact on these musicians—who contributed to and helped to define  |rock_and_roll|Rock_And_Roll|  and rock music—came from the compilation of his works released in 1961 by Columbia Records .      |Brian_Jones|Brian_Jones| , of  |the_Rolling_Stones|The_Rolling_Stones| , introduced his bandmate Keith Richards to this album by Johnson. The blues masters recordings would have as much impact on him as on  |Mick_Jagger|Mick_Jagger| . The group performed his  |Walkin_Blues|Walkin_Blues|  at the  |Rock_and_Roll_Circus|Rock_And_Roll_Circus|  in 1968. They arranged their own version of  |Love_in_Vain|Love_In_Vain|  for their album  Let It Bleed  and recorded  |Stop_Breakin_Down_Blues|Stop_Breakin_Down_Blues|  for  Exile on Main Street . Jagger, in the role of Turner in the 1970 film  Performance , performed excerpts from  |Come_On_in_My_Kitchen|Come_On_In_My_Kitchen|  and  |Me_and_the_Devil_Blues|Me_And_The_Devil_Blues|  .      |Alexis_Korner|Alexis_Korner| , who has been called the Founding Father of British Blues , co-wrote and recorded a song entitled Robert Johnson for  The Party Album , released in 1978. Other examples of the influence he had on English blues and  |blues-rock|Blues_Rock|  musicians and musical groups include the following:    |Eric_Clapton|Eric_Clapton|  considers Johnson the most important blues musician who ever lived . He recorded enough of his songs to make  Me and Mr. Johnson , a blues-rock album released in 2004 as a tribute to the legendary bluesman . He earlier recorded Crossroads , an arrangement of  |Cross_Road_Blues|Cross_Road_Blues|  , with  |Cream|Cream|  in 1968, leading some to consider him the man largely responsible for making Robert Johnson a household name. . Listen to the Story. KPLU 88.5. March 23, 2012.    |Robert_Plant|Robert_Plant| , of  |Led_Zeppelin|Led_Zeppelin| , referred to Johnson on the  |NPR|National_Public_Radio|  radio program Fresh Air as Robert Johnson, to whom we all owed our existence, in some way. His group recorded  |Traveling_Riverside_Blues|Traveling_Riverside_Blues|  , a song that drew from Johnsons original and quoted a number of his songs; the accompanying music video showed images from the Delta, which Johnson often wrote about.    |Fleetwood_Mac|Fleetwood_Mac|  was strongly influenced by Johnson in the groups early years as a British blues band. Guitarist  |Jeremy_Spencer|Jeremy_Spencer|  contributed two covers of Johnson-derived songs to the groups early albums, and lead guitarist  |Peter_Green|Peter_Green|  later recorded Johnsons entire catalogue in two albums,  The Robert Johnson Songbook  and  Hot Foot Powder .    |Sam_Dunns|Sam_Dunn|  documentary  Metal Evolution  cites Johnson as the great grandfather to all things heavy metal , with members of the bands  |Rush|Rush|  and  |Slipknot|Slipknot|  agreeing that he played a major role in the development of rock music.    |Bob_Dylan|Bob_Dylan|  wrote of Johnson in his 2004 autobiography  Chronicles: Volume One , If I hadnt heard the Robert Johnson record when I did, there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that I wouldnt have felt free enough or upraised enough to write.          Johnsons revolutionary guitar playing has led contemporary critics, assessing his talents through the handful of old recordings available, to rate him among the greatest guitar players of all time:   In 1990,  Spin magazine rated him first in its list of 35 Guitar Gods —on the 52nd anniversary of his death. 35 Guitar Gods . Spin. August 1990.   In 2008,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked him fifth on their list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time —70 years after he died.   In 2010, Guitar.com ranked him ninth in its list of Top 50 Guitarists of All Time —72 years after he died.      Musicians who proclaim Johnsons profound impact on them—including Keith Richards,  |Jimi_Hendrix|Jimi_Hendrix| , and Eric Clapton—all rated in the top ten with him on each of these lists. The  |boogie|Boogie_Woogie| |bass_line|Bass_Line|  he fashioned for  |I_Believe_Ill_Dust_My_Broom|I_Believe_Ill_Dust_My_Broom|  has now passed into the standard guitar repertoire. At the time it was completely new, a guitarists version of something people would otherwise have heard only from a piano. Wald 2004, p. 136. Reggie Ugwu in the New York Times said that Johnson, imitating the boogie-woogie style of piano playing, used his guitar to play rhythm, bass and slide simultaneously, all while singing.             Very little of Johnsons early life is known with certainty. Two marriage licenses for Johnson have been located in county records offices. The ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates, as do the entries showing his attendance at Indian Creek School, in Tunica, Mississippi. That he was not listed among his mothers children in the  |1910_census|1910_United_States_Census|  Freeland 2000. casts further doubt on these dates. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother, who was also Roberts mother, remembered his birth date as May  8, 1911. The  |1920_census|1920_United_States_Census|  gives his age as 7, suggesting he was born in 1912 or 1913.  Five significant dates from his career are documented: Monday, Thursday and Friday, November 23, 26, and 27, 1936, at a recording session in San Antonio, Texas; and Saturday and Sunday, June 19 and 20, 1937, at a recording session in Dallas. His death certificate, discovered in 1968, lists the date and location of his death. Wardlow and Komara 1998, p. 87.     Johnsons records were admired by record collectors from the time of their first release, and efforts were made to discover his biography, with virtually no success. The blues researcher  |Mack_McCormick|Mack_Mccormick|  began researching his family background in 1972, but died in 2015 without ever publishing his findings. McCormicks research eventually became as much a legend as Johnson himself. In 1982, McCormick permitted  |Peter_Guralnick|Peter_Guralnick|  to publish a summary in Living Blues , later reprinted in book form as Searching for Robert Johnson. Guralnick Later research has sought to confirm this account or to add minor details. A revised summary acknowledging major informants was written by Stephen LaVere for the booklet accompanying the  |compilation_album|Compilation_Album|   Robert Johnson, The Complete Recordings  , and is maintained with updates at the Delta Haze website.    The documentary film  The Search for Robert Johnson  contains accounts by McCormick and Wardlow of what informants have told them: long interviews of  |David_Honeyboy_Edwards|David_Honeyboy_Edwards|  and Johnny Shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family. Another film, Cant You Hear the Wind Howl: The Life and Music of Robert Johnson,  combines documentary segments with recreated scenes featuring  |Keb_Mo|Keb_Mo|  as Johnson with narration by Danny Glover. Shines, Edwards and Robert Lockwood contribute interviews. These published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives, partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with other accounts.     A relatively full account of Johnsons brief musical career emerged in the 1960s, largely from accounts by Son House, Johnny Shines, David Honeyboy Edwards and Robert Lockwood. In 1961, the sleeve notes to the album  King of the Delta Blues Singers  included reminiscences of  |Don_Law|Don_Law|  who had recorded Johnson in 1936. Law added to the mystique surrounding Johnson, representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy.       The two confirmed images of Johnson were located in 1973, in the possession of his half-sister Carrie Thompson, but were not widely published until the late 1980s. A third photo, purporting to show Johnson posing with the blues musician  |Johnny_Shines|Johnny_Shines| , was published in the November 2008 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine. Digiacomo, Frank . Searching for Robert Johnson .  Vanity Fair . November 2008. It was declared authentic by the forensic artist  |Lois_Gibson|Lois_Gibson|  and by Johnsons estate in 2013.  The authenticity of the third photo has been disputed by some music historians, including  |Elijah_Wald|Elijah_Wald| ,  |Bruce_Conforth|Bruce_Conforth|  and  |Gayle_Dean_Wardlow|Gayle_Dean_Wardlow| , who considered that the clothing suggests a date after Johnsons death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched.  In December 2015, a fourth photograph was published, purportedly showing Johnson, his wife Calletta Craft, Estella Coleman, and Robert Lockwood Jr. Baddour, Dylan. . Chron.com. Retrieved 28 December 2015. This photograph was also declared authentic by Lois Gibson, but her identification of Johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians.

In his book Searching for Robert Johnson,  |Peter_Guralnick|Peter_Guralnick|  stated that the blues archivist  |Mack_McCormick|Mack_Mccormick|  showed him a photograph of Johnson with his nephew Louis, probably taken at the same time as the famous pinstripe suit photograph, showing Louis dressed in his United States Navy uniform. This photograph has never been made public.       Johnson left no  |will|Will_And_Testament| . In 1998, the  |Mississippi_Supreme_Court|Mississippi_Supreme_Court|  ruled that Claud Johnson, a retired truck driver living in  |Crystal_Springs,_Mississippi|Crystal_Springs,_Mississippi| , was the son of Robert Johnson and his only heir. The court heard that he had been born to Virgie Jane Smith , who had a relationship with Robert Johnson in 1931. The relationship was attested to by a friend, Eula Mae Williams, but other relatives descended from Robert Johnsons half-sister, Carrie Harris Thompson, contested Claud Johnsons claim. The effect of the judgment was to allow Claud Johnson to receive over $1 million in royalties.  Claud Johnson died, aged 83, on June 30, 2015, leaving six children.        The  Radiolab  podcast Crossroads , broadcast initially April 16, 2012, on  |NPR|Vpr| , raises the possibility that more than one Robert Johnson was traveling around the region making music at the time of the subjects life — perhaps confusing related biographical information. Producers of the show spoke with Tom Graves, Elijah Wald, David Evans, and  |Robert_Mack_McCormick|Mack_Mccormick|  to support this theory. The death certificate attributed to Johnson, for example, indicates on the reverse side that Robert Johnson came to the area to play banjo and died of  |syphilis|Syphilis| . This could help explain some of the confusion surrounding Johnsons cause of death.     Johnson was also reportedly seen twice after his supposed death, once in 1939 and another time in  |Memphis|Memphis,_Tennessee|  in 1941.              Eleven 78-rpm records by Johnson were released by  |Vocalion_Records|Vocalion_Records|  during his lifetime. A twelfth was issued posthumously. Komara 2007, pp. 63–68. Johnsons estate holds the copyrights to his songs.     In 1961, Columbia Records released  King of the Delta Blues Singers  on vinyl, the album representing the first modern-era release of Johnsons performances, which started the re-discovery of Johnson as blues artist.     Columbia Records issued a second volume,  King of the Delta Blues Singers, Vol. II , in 1970.      The Complete Recordings , a two-disc set, released on August 28, 1990, contains almost everything Johnson recorded, with all 29 recordings, and 12 alternate takes.  . The Awards Insider.
