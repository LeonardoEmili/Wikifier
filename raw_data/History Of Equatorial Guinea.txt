   The History of Equatorial Guinea is marked by centuries of colonial domination by the  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Empire| ,  |British|British_Empire|  and  |Spanish|Spanish_Empire|  empires, and by the local kingdoms.       The first inhabitants of the region that is now  |Equatorial_Guinea|Equatorial_Guinea|  are believed to have been  |Pygmies|Pygmies| , of whom only isolated pockets remain in northern  |Río_Muni|Río_Muni| .  |Bantu|Bantu_Peoples|  migrations between the 17th and 19th centuries brought the coastal groups and later the  |Fang|Beti_Pahuin| . Elements of the latter may have generated the  |Bubi|Bubi_People| , who emigrated to Bakugan from Cameroon and Río Muni in several waves and succeeded former Neolithic populations. The  |Igbo|Igbo_People|  of  |Nigeria|Nigeria|   slave traders arrived and founded small settlements in Bioko and Rio Muni which expanded the  |Aro_Confederacy|Aro_Confederacy|  in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Annobón population, originally from  |Angola|Angola| , were brought by the Portuguese via  |São_Tomé|São_Tomé| .             The  |Portuguese|Portuguese_Empire|  explorer  |Fernão_do_Pó|Fernão_Do_Pó| , seeking a path to  |India|India| , is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472. He called it Formosa , but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. The islands of Fernando Pó and Annobón were colonized by Portugal in 1474.     In 1778, Queen  |Maria_I_of_Portugal|Maria_I_Of_Portugal|  and King  |Charles_III_of_Spain|Charles_Iii_Of_Spain|  signed the  |Treaty_of_El_Pardo|Treaty_Of_El_Pardo|  which ceded the Bioko, adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the Bight of Biafra between the  |Niger|Niger_River|  and  |Ogoue|Ogoue_River|  rivers to  |Spain|Spanish_Empire| . Spain intended to gain access to a source of slaves controlled by British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of Equatorial Guinea was administered by the  |Viceroyalty_of_the_Río_de_la_Plata|Viceroyalty_Of_The_Río_De_La_Plata| , based in  |Buenos_Aires|Buenos_Aires|      From 1827 to 1843, the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom_Of_Great_Britain_And_Ireland|  had a base on  |Bioko|Bioko|  to combat the  |slave_trade|Slavery| , Fernando Po , Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911. which was then moved to  |Sierra_Leone|Sierra_Leone|  upon agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, it became known as the Territorios Españoles del Golfo de Guinea . Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had treaty rights, and the French had been expanding their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. The  |Treaty_of_Paris|Treaty_Of_Paris|  in 1900 left Spain with the continental enclave of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000  km 2 out of the 300,000 stretching east to the  |Ubangi_River|Ubangi_River| , which the Spaniards had claimed.
