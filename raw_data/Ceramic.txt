                       A ceramic  is a  |solid|Solid|  material comprising an  |inorganic_compound|Inorganic_Compound|  of  |metal|Metal| ,  |non_metal|Nonmetal|  or  |metalloid|Metalloid|  atoms primarily held in  |ionic|Ionic_Bonding|  and  |covalent|Covalent_Bond|  bonds. Common examples are  |earthenware|Earthenware| ,  |porcelain|Porcelain| , and  |brick|Brick| .      The  |crystallinity|Crystallinity|  of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline,  |vitrified|Vitrification| , and often completely  |amorphous|Amorphous|  . Most often, fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case with earthenware,  |stoneware|Stoneware| , and porcelain. Varying crystallinity and  |electron|Electron|  composition in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and  |electrical_insulators|Insulator|  . With such a large range of possible options for the composition/structure of a ceramic , the breadth of the subject is vast, and identifiable attributes  are difficult to specify for the group as a whole. General properties such as high melting temperature, high hardness, poor conductivity, high  |moduli_of_elasticity|Elastic_Modulus| , chemical resistance and low ductility are the norm,  with known exceptions to each of these rules . Many composites, such as  |fiberglass|Fiberglass|  and  |carbon_fiber|Carbon_Fiber_Reinforced_Polymer| , while containing ceramic materials, are not considered to be part of the ceramic family.      The earliest ceramics made by humans were  |pottery|Pottery|  objects  or  |figurines|Figurine|  made from  |clay|Clay| , either by itself or mixed with other materials like  |silica|Silicon_Dioxide| , hardened and  |sintered|Sintering|  in fire. Later ceramics were  |glazed|Glazing|  and fired to create smooth, colored surfaces, decreasing  |porosity|Porosity|  through the use of glassy, amorphous ceramic coatings on top of the crystalline ceramic substrates.  Ceramics now include domestic, industrial and building products, as well as a wide range of  |ceramic_art|Ceramic_Art| . In the 20th century, new  |ceramic_materials|Ceramic_Materials|  were developed for use in advanced ceramic engineering, such as in  |semiconductors|Semiconductor| .     The word  ceramic  comes from the  |Greek|Greek_Language|  word  , of pottery or for pottery , , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library from  , potters clay, tile, pottery . , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library The earliest known mention of the root ceram- is the  |Mycenaean_Greek|Mycenaean_Greek|  , workers of ceramics , written in  |Linear_B|Linear_B|  syllabic script. , Word study tool of ancient languages The word ceramic may be used as an adjective to describe a material, product or process, or it may be used as a noun, either singular, or, more commonly, as the plural noun ceramics .                A ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as  |carbon|Carbon|  or  |silicon|Silicon| , may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in  |shearing|Shear_Stress|  and tension. They withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, ranging from 1,000  °C to 1,600  °C .  |Glass|Glass|  is often not considered a ceramic because of its  |amorphous|Amorphous|  character. However, glassmaking involves several steps of the ceramic process, and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials.     Traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as  |kaolinite|Kaolinite| , whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as  |alumina|Alumina| . The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include  |silicon_carbide|Silicon_Carbide|  and  |tungsten_carbide|Tungsten_Carbide| . Both are valued for their abrasion resistance and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical, electronics industries and body armor.       Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories – either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction in situ, or by forming powders into the desired shape, and then  |sintering|Sintering|  to form a solid body.  |Ceramic_forming_techniques|Ceramic_Forming_Techniques|  include shaping by hand ,  |slip_casting|Slipcasting| ,  |tape_casting|Tape_Casting|  ,  |injection_molding|Injection_Molding| , dry pressing, and other variations.       Noncrystalline ceramics, being glass, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing into a mold. If later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic, widely used as cook-tops and also as a glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal.       The physical properties of any ceramic substance are a direct result of its crystalline structure and chemical composition.  |Solid_state_chemistry|Solid_State_Chemistry|  reveals the fundamental connection between microstructure and properties such as localized density variations, grain size distribution, type of porosity and second-phase content, which can all be correlated with ceramic properties such as mechanical strength σ by the Hall-Petch equation,  |hardness|Hardness| ,  |toughness|Toughness| ,  |dielectric_constant|Dielectric_Constant| , and the  |optical|Optical|  properties exhibited by  |transparent_materials|Transparent_Materials| .      |Ceramography|Ceramography|  is the art and science of preparation, examination and evaluation of ceramic microstructures. Evaluation and characterization of ceramic microstructures is often implemented on similar spatial scales to that used commonly in the emerging field of nanotechnology: from tens of  |angstroms|Angstrom|  to tens of micrometers . This is typically somewhere between the minimum wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye.     The microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries, pores, micro-cracks, structural defects and hardness microindentions. Most bulk mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the observed microstructure. The fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the cleaved and polished microstructure. Physical properties which constitute the field of  |materials_science|Materials_Science|  and  |engineering|Engineering|  include the following:            Mechanical properties are important in structural and building materials as well as textile fabrics. In modern  |materials_science|Materials_Science| , fracture mechanics is an important tool in improving the mechanical performance of materials and components. It applies the  |physics|Physics|  of  |stress|Stress|  and  |strain|Deformation| , in particular the theories of  |elasticity|Elasticity|  and  |plasticity|Plasticity| , to the microscopic  |crystallographic_defects|Crystallographic_Defects|  found in real materials in order to predict the macroscopic mechanical failure of bodies.  |Fractography|Fractography|  is widely used with fracture mechanics to understand the causes of failures and also verify the theoretical  |failure|Failure|  predictions with real life failures.     Ceramic materials are usually  |ionic|Ionic_Bond|  or  |covalent|Covalent|  bonded materials, and can be  |crystal|Crystal| line or  |amorphous|Amorphous_Solid| . A material held together by either type of bond will tend to  |fracture|Fracturebrittle_Fracture|  before any  |plastic_deformation|Plastic_Deformation|  takes place, which results in poor  |toughness|Toughness|  in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend to be porous, the  |pores|Porosity|  and other microscopic imperfections act as  |stress_concentrators|Stress_Concentration| , decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the  |tensile_strength|Tensile_Strength| . These combine to give  |catastrophic_failures|Catastrophic_Failure| , as opposed to the more ductile  |failure_modes|Failure_Mode|  of metals.     These materials do show  |plastic_deformation|Plasticity| . However, because of the rigid structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available  |slip_systems|Slip_System|  for  |dislocations|Dislocation|  to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline materials,  |viscous|Viscosity|  flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials.     To overcome the brittle behaviour, ceramic material development has introduced the class of  |ceramic_matrix_composite|Ceramic_Matrix_Composite|  materials, in which ceramic fibers are embedded and with specific coatings are forming fiber bridges across any crack. This mechanism substantially increases the fracture toughness of such ceramics. Ceramic  |disc_brakes|Disc_Brake|  are an example of using a ceramic matrix composite material manufactured with a specific process.       Often times if a ceramic will be subjected to substantial mechanical loading it will undergo a process called  |Ice_templating|Freeze_Casting| . This process allows the finite control of the  |microstructure|Microstructure|  of the ceramic material and therefore the control of the mechanical properties. Ceramic engineers use this technique to tune the mechanical properties to their desired application. Specifically,  |Strength|Strength_Of_Materials|  is increased when this technique is employed. Ice templating allows one to create macroscopic pores in a unidirectional arrangement. The applications of this oxide strengthening technique are important for  |solid_oxide_fuel_cells|Solid_Oxide_Fuel_Cell|  and also  |water_filtration|Water_Purification|  devices.     In order to process a sample through ice templating a few steps are required to be completed by the ceramicist. First an aqueous  |colloidal_suspension|Colloid|  must be prepared containing the dissolved ceramic powder, say  |Yttria_Stablized_Zirconia_|Yttria_Stabilized_Zirconia| . After the ceramic precursor is ensured to be evenly dispersed throughout the colloidal solution then next processing step may begin. At this point we have a pure solution containing our YSZ dissolved powder and aqueous  |water|Water|  in the liquid state. The solution is then cooled on a platform that allows for unidirectional cooling like the one shown in the animation to the right. The solution sample of YSZ is cooled from the bottom to the top in a unidirectional fashion. This forces  |ice|Ice|  crystals to grow in compliance to the unidirectional cooling. Inside the solution, as it is cooling, these ice crystals force the dissolved YSZ particles to the solidification front of the solid-liquid interphase boundary. At this stage of the process we have pure ice crystals lined up in a unidirectional fashion alongside concentrated pockets of the YSZ colloidal particles. The next step of the process is the  |sublimation|Sublimation|  step. The sample is simultaneously heated and the pressure is reduced enough to force to ice crystals to subliminate, since the sample is also heated the YSZ pockets begin to  |anneal|Annealing|  together too form the first macroscopically aligned ceramic microstuctures. The sample is then further  |sintered|Sintering|  to confirm the  |evaporation|Evaporation|  of the residual water and the final consolidation of the ceramic microstructure.     During the execution of this technique a few variables can be controlled to influence the pore size and morphology of the microstructure. These important variables of the ice-templating technique are namely the initial solids loading of the colloid, the cooling rate, the sintering temperature and time length, and also it has been shown that certain additives can influence the micro-structural morphology during this process. A good understanding of these parameters is essential to understanding the relationships between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of anisotropically porous materials.

Some ceramics are  |semiconductors|Semiconductor| . Most of these are  |transition_metal_oxides|Transition_Metal_Oxides|  that are II-VI semiconductors, such as  |zinc_oxide|Zinc_Oxide| .     While there are prospects of mass-producing blue  |LEDs|Led|  from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show  |grain_boundary|Grain_Boundary|  effects.     One of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain  |threshold_voltage|Threshold_Voltage| . Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a  |breakdown|Electrical_Breakdown|  of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its  |electrical_resistance|Electrical_Resistance|  dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred  |ohms|Ohm| . The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self-reset – after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high.     This makes them ideal for  |surge_protection|Surge_Protector|  applications; as there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in  |electrical_substations|Electrical_Substation| , where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from  |lightning|Lightning|  strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.     Semiconducting ceramics are also employed as  |gas_sensors|Gas_Sensor| . When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes. With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be produced.          Under some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit  |high_temperature_superconductivity|High_Temperature_Superconductivity| . The reason for this is not understood, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics.        |Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectricity| , a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to  |measure_time|Crystal_Oscillator|  in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity . The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.     The piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit  |pyroelectricity|Pyroelectricity| , and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These materials can be used to inter convert between thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in  |motion_sensors|Motion_Sensor| , where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.     In turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the  |ferroelectric_effect|Ferroelectric_Effect| , in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field. Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store information in  |ferroelectric_capacitors|Ferroelectric_Capacitor| , elements of  |ferroelectric_RAM|Ferroelectric_Ram| .     The most common such materials are  |lead_zirconate_titanate|Lead_Zirconate_Titanate|  and  |barium_titanate|Barium_Titanate| . Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency  |loudspeakers|Loudspeaker| , transducers for  |sonar|Sonar| , and actuators for  |atomic_force|Atomic_Force_Microscope|  and  |scanning_tunneling_microscopes|Scanning_Tunneling_Microscope| .          Increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metals| |titanates|Titanate| . The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass through the material until  |joule_heating|Joule_Heating|  brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.     At the transition temperature, the materials  |dielectric|Dielectric|  response becomes theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with ceramic in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.           |Optically_transparent_materials|Optics|  focus on the response of a material to incoming lightwaves of a range of wavelengths.  |Frequency_selective_optical_filters|Optical_Filter|  can be utilized to alter or enhance the brightness and contrast of a digital image. Guided lightwave transmission via frequency selective  |waveguides|Waveguides|  involves the emerging field of fiber  |optics|Optics|  and the ability of certain glassy compositions as a  |transmission_medium|Transmission_Medium|  for a range of frequencies simultaneously  with little or no  |interference|Adjacent_Channel_Interference|  between competing  |wavelengths|Wavelengths|  or frequencies. This  |resonant|Resonant| |_mode|Normal_Mode|  of  |energy|Energy|  and  |data_transmission|Data_Transmission|  via electromagnetic  |wave_propagation|Wave_Propagation| , though low powered, is virtually lossless. Optical waveguides are used as components in  |Integrated_optical_circuits|Integrated_Optical_Circuit|   or as the transmission medium in local and long haul  |optical_communication|Optical_Communication|  systems. Also of value to the emerging materials scientist is the sensitivity of materials to radiation in the thermal  |infrared|Infrared|  portion of the  |electromagnetic_spectrum|Electromagnetic_Spectrum| . This heat-seeking ability is responsible for such diverse optical phenomena as  |Night_vision|Night_Vision|  and IR  |luminescence|Luminescence| .     Thus, there is an increasing need in the  |military|Military|  sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to  |transmit|Transmit| |_light|Light|   in the  |visible|Visible_Spectrum|  and mid- |infrared|Infrared|  regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring  |transparent|Transparency_And_Translucency|  armor, including next-generation high-speed  |missiles|Missile|  and pods, as well as protection against improvised explosive devices .     In the 1960s, scientists at General Electric discovered that under the right manufacturing conditions, some ceramics, especially  |aluminium_oxide|Aluminium_Oxide|  , could be made  |translucent|Translucent| . These translucent materials were transparent enough to be used for containing the electrical  |plasma|Plasma|  generated in high- |pressure|Pressure| |_sodium|Sodium|  street lamps. During the past two decades, additional types of transparent ceramics have been developed for applications such as nose cones for  |heat_seeking|Heat_Seeking| |_missiles|Missiles| ,  |windows|Window|  for fighter  |aircraft|Aircraft| , and  |scintillation_counters|Scintillation_Counter|  for computed  |tomography|Tomography|  scanners.     In the early 1970s, Thomas Soules pioneered computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina. His model showed that microscopic  |pores|Porosity|  in ceramic, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline  |grains|Crystallite| , caused light to  |scatter|Scattering|  and prevented true transparency. The volume fraction of these microscopic pores had to be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission.     This is basically a  |particle_size|Particle_Size|  effect.  |Opacity|Opacity|  results from the  |incoherent_scattering|Incoherent_Scattering|  of light at surfaces and  |interfaces|Interface| . In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of  |grain_boundaries|Grain_Boundaries|  which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.     In the formation of  |polycrystalline|Polycrystalline|  materials  the size of the  |crystalline|Crystalline|  grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline  |particles|Wiktionary_Particles|  present in the raw material during formation of the object. Moreover, the size of the  |grain_boundaries|Grain_Boundaries|  scales directly with particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size below the  |wavelength|Wavelength|  of  |visible_light|Visible_Light|  eliminates any light  |scattering|Scattering| , resulting in a  |transparent|Transparency_And_Translucency|  material.     Recently, Japanese scientists have developed techniques to produce ceramic parts that rival the  |transparency|Transparency_And_Translucency|  of traditional crystals and exceed the  |fracture_toughness|Fracture_Toughness|  of a single crystal. In particular, scientists at the Japanese firm Konoshima Ltd., a producer of ceramic construction materials and industrial chemicals, have been looking for markets for their transparent ceramics.     Livermore researchers realized that these ceramics might greatly benefit high-powered  |lasers|Lasers|  used in the National Ignition Facility Programs Directorate. In particular, a Livermore research team began to acquire advanced transparent ceramics from Konoshima to determine if they could meet the  |optical|Optical|  requirements needed for Livermore’s Solid-State Heat Capacity Laser . Livermore researchers have also been testing applications of these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser-driven  |fusion|Nuclear_Fusion|  power plants.                  A  |composite_material|Composite_Material|  of ceramic and  |metal|Metal|  is known as  |cermet|Cermet| .     Other ceramic materials, generally requiring greater purity in their make-up than those above, include forms of several chemical compounds, including:      |Barium_titanate|Barium_Titanate|   displays  |ferroelectricity|Ferroelectricity| , meaning that its mechanical, electrical, and thermal responses are coupled to one another and also history-dependent. It is widely used in  |electromechanical|Electromechanics| |transducers|Transducer| , ceramic  |capacitors|Capacitor| , and  |data_storage|Ferroelectric_Ram|  elements.  |Grain_boundary|Crystallite|  conditions can create  |PTC|Positive_Temperature_Coefficient|  effects in  |heating_elements|Heating_Element| .    |Bismuth_strontium_calcium_copper_oxide|Bismuth_Strontium_Calcium_Copper_Oxide| , a  |high_temperature_superconductor|High_Temperature_Superconductor| |_Boron_oxide|Boron_Oxide|  is used in body armour.    |Boron_nitride|Boron_Nitride|  is structurally  |isoelectronic|Isoelectronic|  to carbon and takes on similar physical forms: a  |graphite|Graphite| -like one used as a  |lubricant|Lubricant| , and a  |diamond|Diamond| -like one used as an abrasive.    |Earthenware|Earthenware|  used for domestic ware such as plates and mugs.    |Ferrite|Ferrite|  is used in the  |magnetic_cores|Magnetic_Core|  of electrical  |transformers|Transformer|  and  |magnetic_core_memory|Magnetic_Core_Memory| .    |Lead_zirconate_titanate|Lead_Zirconate_Titanate|  was developed at the  |United_States|United_States| |_National_Bureau_of_Standards|National_Institute_Of_Standards_And_Technology|  in 1954. PZT is used as an  |ultrasonic_transducer|Ultrasonic_Sensor| , as its piezoelectric properties greatly exceed those of Rochelle salt. Wachtman, John B., Jr. Ceramic Innovations in the 20th century, The American Ceramic Society. .    |Magnesium_diboride|Magnesium_Diboride|   is an  |unconventional_superconductor|Unconventional_Superconductor| .    |Porcelain|Porcelain|  is used for a wide range of household and industrial products.    |Sialon|Sialon|   has high strength; resistance to thermal shock, chemical and wear resistance, and low density. These ceramics are used in non-ferrous molten metal handling, weld pins and the chemical industry.    |Silicon_carbide|Silicon_Carbide|  is used as a  |susceptor|Susceptor|  in microwave furnaces, a commonly used abrasive, and as a  |refractory|Refraction|  material.    |Silicon_nitride|Silicon_Nitride|   is used as an  |abrasive|Abrasive|  powder.   Steatite is used as an  |electrical_insulator|Electrical_Insulator| .    |Titanium_carbide|Titanium_Carbide|  Used in space shuttle re-entry shields and scratchproof watches.    |Uranium_oxide|Uranium_Oxide|  , used as  |fuel|Nuclear_Fuel|  in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor| .    |Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide|Yttrium_Barium_Copper_Oxide|  , another high temperature  |superconductor|Superconductivity| .    |Zinc_oxide|Zinc_Oxide|  , which is a  |semiconductor|Semiconductor| , and used in the construction of  |varistors|Varistor| .    |Zirconium_dioxide|Zirconium_Dioxide|  , which in pure form undergoes many  |phase_changes|Phase_Transition|  between room temperature and practical  |sintering|Sintering|  temperatures, can be chemically stabilized in several different forms. Its high oxygen  |ion_conductivity|Ion_Conductivity|  recommends it for use in  |fuel_cells|Fuel_Cell|  and automotive  |oxygen_sensors|Oxygen_Sensor| . In another variant,  |metastable|Metastable|  structures can impart  |transformation_toughening|Fracture_Toughness|  for mechanical applications; most  |ceramic_knife|Ceramic_Knife|  blades are made of this material.   Partially stabilised zirconia is much less brittle than other ceramics and is used for metal forming tools, valves and liners, abrasive slurries, kitchen knives and bearings subject to severe abrasion.               For convenience, ceramic products are usually divided into four main types; these are shown below with some examples:   Structural, including  |bricks|Brick| ,  |pipes|Pipe| ,  |floor|Flooring|  and  |roof_tiles|Roof_Tile| |_Refractories|Refractory| , such as  |kiln|Kiln|  linings, gas fire radiants,  |steel|Steel|  and glass making crucibles   Whitewares, including  |tableware|Tableware| , cookware, wall tiles, pottery products and sanitary ware    Technical, also known as engineering, advanced, special, and fine ceramics. Such items include:   gas burner  |nozzles|Nozzle| |_ballistic_protection|Ballistic_Vest| ,  |vehicle_armour|Vehicle_Armour| |_nuclear_fuel|Nuclear_Fuel|  uranium oxide pellets    |biomedical_implants|Implant| |_jet_engine|Jet_Engine| |_turbine|Turbine|  blades   ceramic  |disk_brake|Disk_Brake| |_missile|Missile|  nose cones    |bearing_|Bearing| |_Space_Shuttle_program|Space_Shuttle_Program|           Frequently, the raw materials of modern ceramics do not include clays. Geiger, Greg. , American Ceramic Society   Those that do are classified as follows:    |Earthenware|Earthenware| , fired at lower temperatures than other types    |Stoneware|Stoneware| ,  |vitreous|Vitrificationin_Ceramics|  or semi-vitreous    |Porcelain|Porcelain| , which contains a high content of  |kaolin|Kaolin| |_Bone_china|Bone_China|        Ceramics can also be classified into three distinct material categories:    |Oxides|Oxide| :  |alumina|Alumina| ,  |beryllia|Beryllia| ,  |ceria|Ceria| ,  |zirconia|Zirconia| |_carbide|Carbide| ,  |boride|Boride| ,  |nitride|Nitride| ,  |silicide|Silicide| |Composite_materials|Composite_Material| : particulate reinforced,  |fiber_reinforced|Ceramic_Matrix_Composite| , combinations of  |oxides|Oxide|  and nonoxides.     Each one of these classes can be developed into unique material properties because ceramics tend to be crystalline.       Knife blades: the blade of a  |ceramic_knife|Ceramic_Knife|  will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and susceptible to breaking.    |Carbon_ceramic_brake_disks|Disk_Brake|  for vehicles are resistant to  |brake_fade|Brake_Fade|  at high temperatures.   Advanced  |composite_ceramic_and_metal_matrices|Composite_Armour|  have been designed for most modern  |armoured_fighting_vehicles|Armoured_Fighting_Vehicles|  because they offer superior penetrating resistance against  |shaped_charges|Shaped_Charge|   and  |kinetic_energy_penetrators|Kinetic_Energy_Penetrator| .   Ceramics such as  |alumina|Alumina|  and  |boron_carbide|Boron_Carbide|  have been used in  |ballistic_armored_vests|Bulletproof_Vest|  to repel high-velocity  |rifle|Rifle|  fire. Such plates are known commonly as  |small_arms_protective_inserts|Small_Arms_Protective_Insert| , or SAPIs. Similar material is used to protect the  |cockpits|Cockpit|  of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.   Ceramics can be used in place of steel for  |ball_bearings|Ball_Bearing| . Their higher hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last for triple the lifetime of a steel part. They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from  |friction|Friction|  during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.   In the early 1980s,  |Toyota|Toyota|  researched production of an  |adiabatic|Adiabatic| |_engine|Internal_Combustion_Engine|  using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000  °F . The expected advantages would have been lighter materials and a smaller cooling system , leading to a major weight reduction. The expected increase of  |fuel_efficiency|Fuel_Efficiency|  of the engine  could not be verified experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a  |thermal_insulator|Thermal_Insulator| . Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages.  Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology.   |gas_turbine|Gas_Turbine| |_engines|Heat_Engine| . Currently, even blades made of  |advanced_metal_alloys|Superalloy|  used in the engines hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.   Recent advances have been made in ceramics which include  |bioceramics|Bioceramic| , such as dental implants and synthetic bones.  |Hydroxyapatite|Hydroxyapatite| , the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so are of great interest for gene delivery and  |tissue_engineering|Tissue_Engineering|  scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength, and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein  |collagens|Collagen| , synthetic bones.   Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals. B.E. Burakov, M.I Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation, Imperial College Press, London, 198 pp. .   .     High-tech ceramic is used in watchmaking for producing watch cases. The material is valued by watchmakers for its light weight, scratch resistance, durability and smooth touch.  |IWC|International_Watch_Company|  is one of the brands that initiated the use of ceramic in watchmaking.        Ceramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the culture, technology and behavior of peoples of the past. They are among the most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site, generally in the form of small fragments of broken pottery called  |sherds|Sherd| . Processing of collected sherds can be consistent with two main types of analysis: technical and traditional.     Traditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts, sherds and larger fragments into specific types based on style, composition, manufacturing and morphology. By creating these typologies it is possible to distinguish between different cultural styles, the purpose of the ceramic and technological state of the people among other conclusions. In addition, by looking at stylistic changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate the ceramics into distinct diagnostic groups . A comparison of ceramic artifacts with known dated assemblages allows for a chronological assignment of these pieces. Mississippi Valley Archaeological Center,  , Retrieved 04-11-12     The technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the composition of ceramic artifacts and sherds to determine the source of the material and through this the possible manufacturing site. Key criteria are the composition of the clay and the  |temper|Temper| .
