The photoelectric effect is the emission of  |electrons|Electron|  or other free carriers when  |light|Light|  hits a material. Electrons emitted in this manner can be called photoelectrons. This phenomenon is commonly studied in  |electronic|Electronics| |physics|Physics|  and in fields of  |chemistry|Chemistry|  such as  |quantum_chemistry|Quantum_Chemistry|  and  |electrochemistry|Electrochemistry| .     According to  |classical_electromagnetic|Classical_Electromagnetism|  theory, the photoelectric effect can be attributed to the transfer of  |energy|Energy|  from the light to an electron. From this perspective, an alteration in the  |intensity|Intensity|  of light induces changes in the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the metal. According to this theory, a sufficiently dim light is expected to show a time lag between the initial shining of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron.     But the experimental results did not correlate with either of the two predictions made by classical theory. Instead, experiments showed that electrons are dislodged only by the impingement of light when it reached or exceeded a threshold  |frequency|Frequency| . Below that threshold, no electrons are emitted from the material, regardless of the light intensity or the length of time of exposure to the light.     Because a low-frequency beam at a high intensity could not build up the energy required to produce photoelectrons like it would have if lights energy were continuous like a wave,  |Einstein|Albert_Einstein|  proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of  |discrete_wave_packets|Photon|  .     Emission of conduction electrons from typical metals usually requires a few electron-volts, corresponding to short-wavelength visible or ultraviolet light. Emissions can be induced with photons with energies approaching zero to over 1  |MeV|Mev|  for core electrons in  |elements|Chemical_Element|  with a high  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number| . Study of the photoelectric effect led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced the formation of the concept of  |wave–particle_duality|Wave–Particle_Duality| .  Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the photoconductive effect , the  |photovoltaic_effect|Photovoltaic_Effect| , and the  |photoelectrochemical_effect|Photoelectrochemical_Cell| .            The photons of a light beam have  |a_characteristic_energy_which_is_proportional_to_the_frequency_of_the_light|Photon_Energy| . In the photoemission process, if an electron within some material absorbs the energy of one photon and acquires more energy than the  |work_function|Work_Function|  of the material, it is ejected. If the photon energy is too low, the electron is unable to escape the material. Since an increase in the intensity of low-frequency light will only increase the number of low-energy photons sent over a given interval of time, this change in intensity will not create any single photon with enough energy to dislodge an electron. Thus, the energy of the emitted electrons does not depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but only on the energy of the individual photons. It is an interaction between the incident photon and the innermost electrons. The movement of an outer electron to occupy the vacancy then result in the emission of a photon.     Electrons can absorb energy from photons when irradiated, but they usually follow an all or nothing principle. All of the energy from one photon must be absorbed and used to liberate one electron from atomic binding, or else the energy is re-emitted. If the photon energy is absorbed, some of the energy liberates the electron from the atom, and the rest contributes to the electrons  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  as a free particle.        Photoemission can occur from any material, but it is most easily observable from metals or other conductors because the process produces a charge imbalance, and if this charge imbalance is not neutralized by current flow , the potential barrier to emission increases until the emission current ceases. It is also usual to have the emitting surface in a vacuum, since gases impede the flow of photoelectrons and make them difficult to observe. Additionally, the energy barrier to photoemission is usually increased by thin oxide layers on metal surfaces if the metal has been exposed to oxygen, so most practical experiments and devices based on the photoelectric effect use clean metal surfaces in a vacuum.     When the photoelectron is emitted into a solid rather than into a vacuum, the term internal photoemission is often used, and emission into a vacuum distinguished as external photoemission.       The theory of the source of photoelectric effect must explain the experimental observations of the emission of electrons from an illuminated metal surface.     For a given metal surface, there exists a certain minimum frequency of incident  |radiation|Radiation|  below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the threshold frequency. Increasing the frequency of the incident beam, keeping the number of incident photons fixed increases the maximum  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of the photoelectrons emitted. Thus the stopping  |voltage|Voltage|  increases . The number of electrons also changes because of the  |probability|Probability|  that each photon results in an emitted electron are a function of  |photon_energy|Photon_Energy| . If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron.     Above the threshold frequency, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectron depends on the frequency of the incident light, but is independent of the intensity of the incident light so long as the latter is not too high.      For a given metal and frequency of incident radiation, the rate at which photoelectrons are ejected is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light. An increase in the intensity of the incident beam increases the magnitude of the photoelectric current, although the stopping voltage remains the same.     The time lag between the incidence of radiation and the emission of a photoelectron is very small, less than 10 −9 second.     The direction of distribution of emitted electrons peaks in the direction of  |polarization|Polarization|  of the incident light, if it is linearly polarized.        In 1905, Einstein proposed an explanation of the photoelectric effect using a concept first put forward by Max Planck that light waves consist of tiny bundles or packets of energy known as  |photons|Photons|  or quanta.    The maximum  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  K  of an ejected electron is given by     : K  h  -       where h is the  |Planck_constant|Planck_Constant|  and f is the frequency of the incident photon. The term   is the  |work_function|Work_Function|  , which gives the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of the metal. The work function satisfies     :   h      where f0 is the threshold frequency for the metal. The maximum  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of an ejected electron is then     : K  h       Kinetic energy is positive, so we must have f /math ref name Fromhold1991  /ref !--needs a diagram, Ps and Qs confusing otherwise --  ref  /ref math /math  sub /sub  math /math math /math math /math math /math  ref name Stefan2003  /ref  ref name Smithsonian report / ref name Smithsonian report /  ref name Smithsonian report /  ref name Smithsonian report /  ref name Refc /ref ref  /ref  ref name Petrova-KochHezel2009  /ref  ref name Smith1873  /ref  ref name Refe  /ref ref name BudWarner1998  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name Smithsonian report  /ref  ref name Reff  /ref  ref name Refg /ref ref name Refh /ref  ref name Refi /ref  ref name Refj /ref ref name Stoletow1888  /ref ref name Stoletow1888a  /ref ref name Stoletow1888b  /ref ref name Stoletow1889  /ref ref name Stoletow1889a  /ref ref name Stoletow1890  /ref ref name Refk /ref ref name Refl  /ref  ref name Refm  /ref  ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref ref  /ref  sub /sub  ref name Refo  /ref ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref  /ref  ref name Smithsonian report /  ref name RefLenard /  ref name Refp  /ref  ref name Refq  /ref ref name Refr  /ref ref  /ref ref name Smithsonian report /  ref name Refs  /ref ref name Lamb1968  /ref  ref name RefMillikan /  ref name Refu  /ref ref name Ref  /ref ref name Refv  /ref ref name Ref / ref name Refw  /ref  ref name RefTimothy  /ref  ref name Refx  /ref  ref nameTsokos  /ref  ref name Stefan2003 /  ref name Refaa  /ref  ref  /ref ref name Refab  /ref  ref name Refac  /ref ref name Refad  /ref  ref name Evans1955a  /ref  ref name Evans1955  /ref  ref name Davisson1965  /ref math /math  ref name Knoll1999 .
