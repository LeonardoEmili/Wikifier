              The   is the  |Irish|Ireland|  term for a  |supernatural|Supernatural|  race in  |Irish_mythology|Irish_Mythology|  and  |Scottish_mythology|Scottish_Mythology|  , comparable to the  |fairies|Fairy|  or  |elves|Elf| . They are said to live underground in fairy mounds, across the western sea, or in an invisible world that coexists with the world of humans. This world is described in the  Lebor Gabála Érenn  as a  |parallel_universe|Parallel_Universe|  in which the aos sí walk amongst the living. In the  |Irish_language|Irish_Language| , aos sí means people of the mounds . In modern Irish the people of the mounds are also called daoine sídhe ; in Scottish mythology they are daoine sìth. James MacKillop, A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology , s.v. daoine sídhe. They are variously said to be the ancestors, the spirits of nature, or goddesses and gods.  |Evans_Wentz_W_Y_|Walter_Evans_Wentz|  . Gerrards Cross, Colin Smythe Humanities Press      Some  |secondary|Secondary_Source|  and  |tertiary_sources|Tertiary_Source| , including well-known and influential authors such as  |W_B_Yeats|W_B_Yeats| , refer to aos sí simply as the sídhe .        In many  |Gael|Gael| ic tales, the aos sí are later, literary versions of the  |Tuatha_Dé_Danann|Tuatha_Dé_Danann|  —the deities and deified ancestors of  |Irish_mythology|Irish_Mythology| . Some sources describe them as the survivors of the Tuatha Dé Danann who retreated into the  |Otherworld|Otherworld|  when fleeing the mortal Sons of  |Míl_Espáine|Míl_Espáine|  who, like many other early invaders of Ireland, came from Iberia. As part of the terms of their surrender to the  |Milesians|Milesians| , the  |Tuatha_Dé_Danann|Tuatha_Dé_Danann|  agreed to retreat and dwell underground.  |Geoffrey_Keating|Geoffrey_Keating| , an Irish historian of the late 17th century, equates Iberia with the Land of the Dead, providing a possible connection to the aos sí.     In folk belief and practice, the aos sí are often appeased with offerings, and care is taken to avoid angering or insulting them. Often they are not named directly, but rather spoken of as The Good Neighbors , The Fair Folk , or simply The Folk . The most common names for them, aos sí, aes sídhe, daoine sídhe  and daoine sìth mean, literally, people of the mounds . The aos sí are generally described as stunningly beautiful, though they can also be terrible and hideous.     Aos sí are seen as fierce guardians of their abodes—whether a fairy hill, a  |fairy_ring|Fairy_Ring| , a special tree  or a particular  |loch|Loch|  or wood. It is believed that infringing on these spaces will cause the aos sí to retaliate in an effort to remove the people or objects that invaded their homes. Many of these tales contribute to the  |changeling|Changeling|  myth in  |west_European|Western_Europe| |_folklore|Folklore| , with the aos sí kidnapping trespassers or replacing their children with changelings as a punishment for transgressing. The aos sí are often connected to certain times of year and hours; as the  |Gaelic_Otherworld|Tír_Na_Nóg|  is believed to come closer to the mortal world at the times of dusk and dawn, the aos sí correspondingly become easier to encounter. Some festivals such as  |Samhain|Samhain| ,  |Beltane|Beltane|  and  |Midsummer|Midsummer|  are also associated with the aos sí.     sídheídhe are the hills or  |tumuli|Tumulusireland|  that dot the Irish landscape. In modern Irish the word is sí; in Scottish Gaelic, sìth; in Old Irish síde and the singular is síd.  |Dictionary_of_the_Irish_Language|Dictionary_Of_The_Irish_Language| http://www.dil.ie/37441 síd, síth In a number of later, English-language texts, the word sídhe is incorrectly used both for the mounds and the people of the mounds. However sidh in older texts refers specifically to the palaces, courts, halls or residences of the otherworldly beings that supposedly inhabit them. OCurry, E., Lectures on Manuscript Materials, Dublin 1861, p. 504, quoted by Evans-Wentz 1966, p. 291 The fact that many of these sídhe have been found to be ancient burial mounds has contributed to the theory that the aos sí were the pre-Celtic occupants of Ireland.     Others present these stories as  |mythology|Mythology|  deriving from  |Greek|Greece|  cultural influence, deriving arguments mainly from  |Hesiods|Hesiod|   Works and Days , which portrays the basic moral foundation and plantation techniques of the citizens of Greece and describes the races of men, created by the Greek deities. However, many of these views have been deemed unlikely, and the influence can be explained by the similar moral foundations stemming from the two cultures  |Indo_European|Proto_Indo_Europeans|  background.       The  |banshee|Banshee|  or bean sídhe , which means woman of the sídhe ,  |Dictionary_of_the_Irish_Language|Dictionary_Of_The_Irish_Language| http://www.dil.ie/37441 síd, síth and http://www.dil.ie/5644 ben has come to indicate any supernatural woman of Ireland who announces a coming death by wailing and  |keening|Keening| . Her counterpart in  |Scottish_mythology|Scottish_Mythology|  is the bean sìth . Other varieties of aos sí and daoine sìth include the Scottish  bean nighe  |armour|Armour|  of the person who is doomed to die; the  leanan sídhe  cat sìth  Cù Sìth  sluagh sídhe — the fairy host —is sometimes depicted in Irish and Scottish lore as a crowd of airborne spirits, perhaps the cursed, evil or restless dead. The siabhra , may be a type of these lesser spirits, prone to evil and mischief.
