Even in sonnets that dont strictly follow the problem/resolution structure, the ninth line still often marks a turn by signaling a change in the tone, mood, or stance of the poem.     Later, the ABBA ABBA pattern became the standard for Italian sonnets. For the sestet there were two different possibilities: CDE CDE and CDC CDC. In time, other variants on this rhyming scheme were introduced, such as CDCDCD. Petrarch typically used an ABBA ABBA pattern for the octave, followed by either CDE CDE or CDC CDC rhymes in the sestet. The Crybin variant of the Italian sonnet has the rhyme scheme ABBA CDDC EFG EFG.       Most Sonnets in Dantes  La Vita Nuova  are Petrarchan.

These sonnets were all essentially inspired by the Petrarchan tradition, and generally treat of the poets love for some woman, with the exception of Shakespeares sequence of 154 sonnets. The form is often named after Shakespeare, not because he was the first to write in this form but because he became its most famous practitioner. The form consists of fourteen lines structured as three quatrains and a couplet. The third quatrain generally introduces an unexpected sharp thematic or imagistic turn , the volta. In Shakespeares sonnets, however, the volta usually comes in the couplet, and usually summarizes the theme of the poem or introduces a fresh new look at the theme.
