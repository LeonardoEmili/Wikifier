The Azawakh is a  |breed_of_dog|Breed_Of_Dog|  from  |West_Africa|West_Africa| . It is also used as a  |sighthound|Sighthound| , they have been relegated to a secondary function of camp guardian due to the lack of  |game|Game|  in the region. With ancient origins, it is raised throughout the  |Sahelian_zone|Sahel|  of  |Mali|Mali| ,  |Niger|Niger| , and  |Burkina_Faso|Burkina_Faso| . This region includes the  |Azawagh_Valley|Iullemmeden_Basin|  for which the breed is named. While commonly associated with the nomadic  |Tuareg_people|Tuareg_People| , they are also bred and owned by other  |ethnic_groups|List_Of_Ethnic_Groups_Of_Africa|  such as the  |Peulh|Fula_People| ,  |Bella|Ikelan| , and  |Hausa|Hausa_People| . The Azawakah is more related to the  |Sloughi|Sloughi|  than it is to the  |Saluki|Saluki| .                Morphology is very similar to that of the Middle Eastern and South Indian sight hounds, all swift, high-bred coursing hounds, although there are several obvious differences. For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant.       The standards call for a hound from ; its height is . The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are dry , meaning that they are quite flat, unlike the  |Greyhound|Greyhound|  and  |Whippet|Whippet| . In this respect it is similar in type to the  |Saluki|Saluki| .          Colours permitted by the  |Fédération_Cynologique_Internationale_|Fédération_Cynologique_Internationale|  breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and  |brindle|Brindle|  , with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet . Since 2015 white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in the  |FCI|Federation_Cynologique_Internationale|  member countries, as is a white collar or half collar .     Some conservationists support the idea that in Africa, Azawakhs are still found in a variety of colours such as red, blue fawn , grizzle, and, rarely, blue and black with various white markings including Irish marked and particolour . , 2005, Dr. Gabriel Meissen. Because of this wide color variation in the native population, the American standard used by the  |AKC|American_Kennel_Club|  and  |UKC|United_Kennel_Club|  allows any color combination found in Africa.        The Azawakhs light, supple, lissome gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is an upright  |double_suspension_gallop|Double_Suspension_Gallop| .                Azawakhs are an incredibly sound  |coursing|Coursing|  hound. Serious injuries are rare. The dogs heal very quickly from injury.     Azawakh have no known incidence of hip dysplasia. There is a small occurrence of adult-onset idiopathic  |epilepsy|Epilepsy|  in the breed.  |Wobbler_disease|Wobbler_Disease| , or cervical vertebral instability, does rarely occur. Some breeders believe this is largely a developmental problem where puppies grow too quickly due to a high-protein Western diet.       Like the Basenji and Tibetan Mastiff, the Azawakh often has a single annual estrus. Unassisted birth of healthy puppies is normal. Litter sizes are usually from four to six puppies, but litters as small as one and as large as ten occur.       Azawakh need a fairly high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in large enclosed areas to run off steam. The dogs are very social and emotional. They need a master that provides firm but fair leadership. Azawakh thrive on companionship of other Azawakh.       Bred by the  |Tuareg|Tuareg_People| ,  |Fula|Fula_People|  and various other nomads of the  |Sahara|Sahara|  and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of  |Mali|Mali| ,  |Niger|Niger| ,  |Burkina_Faso|Burkina_Faso| , and southern  |Algeria|Algeria| , the breed known by the tuaregs as ”Oska” was used there as a  |guard_dog|Guard_Dog|  and to hunt  |gazelle|Gazelle|  and  |hare|Hare|  at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. The austerity of the  |Sahel|Sahel|  environment has ensured that only the most fit dogs survive and has accentuated the breeds ruggedness and independence. Unlike some other sighthounds, the Azawakh is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. In role of a guard dog, if an Azawakh senses danger it will bark to alert the other members of the pack, and they will gather together as a pack under the lead of the alpha dog, then chase off or attack the predator. The  |Sloughi|Sloughi| , by comparison, is more of an independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct.     Azawakhs have a range of temperaments from lap dog to quite fierce. Lifelong socialization and firm but gentle handling are critical. Well socialised and trained, they can be good with other dogs, cats, children, and strangers.     Unlike other sighthounds, the primary function of the Azawakh in its native land is that of protector. It develops an intense bond with its owner, yet can perform independently from its master. With those they accept, Azawakh are gentle and extremely affectionate. With strangers many are reserved and prefer not to be touched, but are not inherently aggressive. Although raised to guard against predators, they do not have innate aggression toward canines or humans unless they are threatened.     Azawakh have high energy and tremendous endurance. They are excellent training companions for runners and are nearly impervious to heat. They will happily run in weather over 100 degrees Fahrenheit that would kill a  |Greyhound|Greyhound| .     Many Azawakh dislike rain and cold weather.     Azawakh are pack oriented and form complex social hierarchies. They have tremendous memories and are able to recognize each other after long periods of separation. They can often be found sleeping on top of each other for warmth and companionship.       Alberto Rossi: To raise an Azawakh is like building a very fragile construction, which takes a lot of sensibility and can be destroyed from one minute to the next. But every minute it lasts, it fills you with great happiness. Every time I´m sitting in a chair or sofa at least one of my dogs tries to take a seat on my lap. The same happens to those of my guests which they love. In these moments they seem to be the image of calmness, gentleness, and trust. But one should not be deceived about this. In the deepest place of their soul resides something wild and native, and they will remind us about it with the first occasion and we should not forget, even for a moment, not to treat them like a normal dog.       Throughout the Sahel, very elegant puppies can be found among rustic siblings. The Sahel nomads do not have the same breed concepts as in the West and, unlike the  |Bedouin|Bedouin|  of the North, do not recognize a strict separation of al hor from kelb dogs. The nomads act as an extra level of selection on top of the intense natural selection pressure of the Sahel environment. The approach to selection is diametrically opposed to Western breeding, and presents the advantage of maintaining a large reservoir of genetic variability and resilience.     The peoples of the Sahel control dam lines and cull puppies heavily at birth according to locally held aesthetic criteria that are not yet fully understood. In the Sahel, color is not a selection criterion. The alpha male dog from the local population is usually the sire. Females are usually culled unless the family projects a need for more dogs in the future.     The breed is relatively uncommon in Europe and North America but there is a growing band of devotees. Azawakh may be registered with the FCI in the USA via the Federación Canófila de Puerto Rico .    European FCI clubs and the AKC recognize the FCPR as an acceptable registry. The  |AKC|American_Kennel_Club|   currently recognizes Azawakh as a  |Foundation_Stock_Service|Foundation_Stock_Service_Program|   breed and they are eligible to participate in AKC-sanctioned Companion & Performance events. The breed will enter the AKC Miscellaneous Class on June 30, 2011. The American Azawakh Association .   is the AKC Parent Club for the Azawakh. Azawakh may be registered with the  |UKC|United_Kennel_Club|  and  |ARBA|American_Rare_Breed_Association| . The breed is not yet registered by  |CKC|Canadian_Kennel_Club| . Azawakh are eligible for  |ASFA|American_Sighthound_Field_Association|  and  |AKC|American_Kennel_Club|  lure coursing and  |NOFCA|Nofca|  open field coursing events.                     The breed originated from the  |pariah_dogs|Pariah_Dogs|  of sub-Saharan Africa  also called bush dogs or basenji—and is also closely related to the  |Sloughi|Sloughi|  of the  |Maghreb|Maghreb| . Despite morphological similarities, mitochondrial DNA evidence shows that it is only very distantly related to other sight hounds. Azawakh have a rare  |glucose_isomerase|Glucose_Isomerase|  allele that occurs only in  |fox|Fox| es,  |jackals|Jackals| ,  |Italian_wolves|Eurasian_Wolfitalian_Wolf| , Sloughi dogs and a handful of other quite unrelated rare dogs found mostly in Japan. The presence of the GPI B suggests an ancient differentiation of the Azawakh from other dog populations.  |Petroglyph|Petroglyph|  rock art dating from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago during the  |Green_Sahara|Green_Sahara|  shows cursorial dogs in conjunction with hunters. Archaeologists have found dog bones buried in Holocene settlements in the Sahara. At the close of the Holocene Wet Phase in the 4th millennium BCE, the Sahara returned to desert and created a formidable physical barrier to travel. Together, this evidence suggests that the Azawakh population has a unique genetic heritage and that it has been largely isolated from other dog populations for millennia.
