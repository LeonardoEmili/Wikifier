   A barrister is a type of  |lawyer|Lawyer|  in  |common_law|Common_Law| |jurisdictions|Jurisdiction| . Barristers mostly specialise in courtroom  |advocacy|Advocacy|  and  |litigation|Litigation| . Their tasks include taking cases in superior  |courts|Court|  and  |tribunals|Tribunal| , drafting legal  |pleadings|Pleading| , researching the philosophy, hypothesis and history of law, and giving expert legal opinions.     Barristers are distinguished from  |solicitors|Solicitor| , who have more direct access to clients, and may do transactional-type legal work. It is mainly barristers who are appointed as judges, and they are rarely hired by clients directly. In some legal systems, including those of  |Scotland|Scots_Law| ,  |South_Africa|Anglo-Dutch_Law| ,  |Scandinavia|Stockholm_Institute_For_Scandinavian_Lawscandinavian_Law| ,  |Pakistan|Law_Of_Pakistan| ,  |India|Law_Of_India| ,  |Bangladesh|Law_Of_Bangladesh| , and the British Crown dependencies of  |Jersey|Law_Of_Jersey| ,  |Guernsey|Guernseypolitics|  and the  |Isle_of_Man|Manx_Law| , the word barrister is also regarded as an  |honorific|Honorific|  title.     In a few jurisdictions, barristers are usually forbidden from conducting litigation, and can only act on the instructions of a solicitor, who performs tasks such as corresponding with parties and the court, and  |drafting|Legal_Writing|  court documents. In England and Wales, barristers may seek authorisation from the  |Bar_Standards_Board|Bar_Standards_Board|  to conduct litigation. This allows a barrister to practise in a dual capacity, fulfilling the role of both barrister and solicitor.      In some countries with common law legal systems, such as  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  and some regions of  |Australia|Australia| ,  |lawyers|Lawyer|  are entitled to practise both as barristers and solicitors, but it remains a separate system of qualification to practise exclusively as a barrister.              A barrister, who can be considered a  |jurist|Jurist| , is a lawyer who represents a litigant as advocate before a court of appropriate jurisdiction. A barrister speaks in court and presents the case before a judge or jury. In some jurisdictions, a barrister receives additional training in evidence law, ethics, and court practice and procedure. In contrast, a solicitor generally meets with clients, does preparatory and administrative work and provides legal advice. In this role, he or she may draft and review legal documents, interact with the client as necessary, prepare evidence, and generally manage the day-to-day administration of a lawsuit. A solicitor can provide a crucial support role to a barrister when in court, such as managing large volumes of documents in the case or even negotiating a settlement outside the courtroom while the trial continues inside.     There are other essential differences. A barrister will usually have  |rights_of_audience|Rights_Of_Audience|  in the higher courts, whereas other legal professionals will often have more limited access, or will need to acquire additional qualifications to have such access. As in common law countries in which there is a split between the roles of barrister and solicitor, the barrister in  |civil_law|Civil_Law|  jurisdictions is responsible for appearing in trials or pleading cases before the courts.     Barristers usually have particular knowledge of case law, precedent, and the skills to build a case. When a solicitor in general practice is confronted with an unusual point of law, they may seek the opinion of counsel on the issue. In  |insurance|Insurance|  contracts there is often the requirement to seek the expert opinion of counsel where the policy contains what is known as a  |QC_clause|Qc_Clause|  .     In most countries, barristers operate as sole practitioners and are prohibited from forming partnerships or from working as a barrister as part of a corporation.  However, barristers normally band together into  |chambers|Chambers|  to share clerks and operating expenses. Some chambers grow to be large and sophisticated and have a distinctly corporate feel. In some jurisdictions, they may be employed by firms of solicitors, banks, or corporations as in-house legal advisers.     In contrast, solicitors and attorneys work directly with the clients and are responsible for engaging a barrister with the appropriate expertise for the case. Barristers generally have little or no direct contact with their lay clients, particularly without the presence or involvement of the solicitor. All correspondence, inquiries, invoices, and so on, will be addressed to the solicitor, who is primarily responsible for the barristers fees.     In court, barristers are often visibly distinguished from solicitors by their apparel. For example, in Ireland, England, and Wales, a barrister usually wears a horsehair wig, stiff collar,  |bands|Bands| , and a gown. Since January 2008,  |solicitor_advocates|Solicitor_Advocate|  have also been entitled to wear wigs, but wear different gowns.      In many countries the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed a monopoly on appearances before the higher courts, but in  |Great_Britain|United_Kingdom|  this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, are not prepared to provide general advice to members of the public.     Historically, barristers have had a major role in trial preparation, including drafting  |pleadings|Pleading|  and reviewing evidence. In some areas of law, that is still the case. In other areas, it is relatively common for the barrister to receive the brief from the instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial only a day or two before the proceeding. Part of the reason for this is cost. A barrister is entitled to a brief fee when a brief is delivered, and this represents the bulk of her/his fee in relation to any trial. They are then usually entitled to a refresher for each day of the trial after the first. But if a case is settled before the trial, the barrister is not needed and the brief fee would be wasted. Some solicitors avoid this by delaying delivery of the brief until it is certain the case will go to trial.       Some benefits of maintaining the split include:   Having an independent barrister reviewing a course of action gives the client a fresh and independent opinion from an expert in the field distinct from solicitors who may maintain ongoing and long-term relationships with the client. This view was expressed by Sir Owen Dixon, Chief Justice of Australia,     In many jurisdictions, judges are appointed from the bar. Since barristers do not have long-term client relationships and are further removed from clients than solicitors, judicial appointees are more independent.   Having recourse to all of the specialist barristers at the bar can enable smaller firms, who could not maintain large specialist departments, to compete with larger firms.   A barrister acts as a check on the solicitor conducting the trial; if it becomes apparent that the claim or defence has not been properly conducted by the solicitor prior to trial, the barrister can advise the client of a separate possible claim against the solicitor.   Expertise in conducting trials, owing to the fact that barristers are specialist advocates.   In many jurisdictions, barristers must follow the  |cab-rank_rule|Cab-Rank_Rule| , which obliges them to accept a brief if it is in their area of expertise and if they are available, facilitating access to justice for the unpopular.     Some disadvantages of the split include:   A multiplicity of legal advisers can lead to less efficiency and higher costs, a concern to Sir  |David_Clementi|David_Clementi|  in his review of the English legal profession.     Because they are further removed from the client, barristers can be less familiar with the clients needs.     A detailed examination of the justifications for a split legal profession and of the arguments in favour of a fused profession can be found in English solicitor Peter Reeves 1986 book, Are Two Legal Professions Necessary? London: Waterlow Publishers Limited, 1986          Barristers are regulated by the  |Bar|Bar_Association|  for the jurisdiction where they practise, and in some countries, by the  |Inn_of_Court|Inns_Of_Court|  to which they belong. In some countries, there is external regulation.     Inns of Court, where they exist, regulate admission to the profession. Inns of Court are independent societies that are titularly responsible for the training, admission , and discipline of barristers. Where they exist, a person may only be called to the Bar by an Inn, of which they must first be a member. In fact, historically, call to and success at the Bar, to a large degree, depended upon social connections made early in life. Daniel Duman, The English and Colonial Bars in the 19th Century ,      A Bar collectively describes all members of the profession of barrister within a given jurisdiction. While as a minimum the Bar is an association embracing all its members, it is usually the case, either de facto or de jure, that the Bar is invested with regulatory powers over the manner in which barristers practise.       In the common law tradition, the respective roles of a lawyer – that is as legal adviser and advocate – were formally split into two separate, regulated sub-professions, the other being the office of solicitor. Historically, the distinction was absolute, but in the modern legal age, some countries that had a split legal profession now have a  |fused_profession|Fused_Profession|  – anyone entitled to practise as a barrister may also practise as a solicitor, and vice versa. In practice, the distinction may be non-existent, minor, or marked, depending on the jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, such as Australia, Scotland and Ireland, there is little overlap.          In the Australian states of  |New_South_Wales|New_South_Wales| ,  |Victoria|Victoria|  and  |Queensland|Queensland| , there is a split profession. Nevertheless, subject to conditions, barristers can accept direct access work from clients. Each state Bar Association regulates the profession and essentially has the functions of the English Inns of Court. In the states of  |South_Australia|South_Australia|  and  |Western_Australia|Western_Australia| , as well as the  |Australian_Capital_Territory|Australian_Capital_Territory| , the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, but an independent bar nonetheless exists, regulated by the Legal Practice Board of the state or territory. In  |Tasmania|Tasmania|  and the  |Northern_Territory|Northern_Territory| , the profession is fused, although a very small number of practitioners operate as an independent bar.     Generally, counsel dress in the traditional English manner  before superior courts, although this is not usually done for interlocutory applications. Wigs and robes are still worn in the Supreme Court and the District Court in civil matters and are dependent on the judicial officers attire. Robes and wigs are worn in all criminal cases.  In Western Australia, wigs are no longer worn in any court.     Each year, the Bar Association appoints certain barristers of seniority and eminence to the rank of Senior Counsel or Queens Counsel . Such barristers carry the title SC or QC after their name. The appointments are made after a process of consultation with members of the profession and the judiciary. Senior Counsel appear in particularly complex or difficult cases. They make up about 14 per cent of the bar in New South Wales.       In Bangladesh, the law relating to the Barristers is the Bangladesh Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Order,1972 as amended which is administered and enforced by the Bangladesh Bar Council. Bangladesh Bar Council is the supreme statutory body to regulate the legal professions in Bangladesh and ensure educational standard and regulatory compliance by the Advocates on roll of the Bar Council. The Bar Council, with the help of government, prescribes rules to regulate the profession. All law graduates educating from home or abroad have to write and pass the Bar Council Examination to be enrolled and admitted as professional Advocates to practise law both as Barristers & Solicitors. The newly enrolled advocates are permitted to start practice in the lower courts after admitting as members of the local Bar Associations. After two years of Practice in lower court, the Advocates are eligible to be enrolled in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. By passing the Bar Council Examination, the advocates are issued with certificates of enrollment and permission in prescribed form to practise in the High Court Division of the Supreme Court also. Only those advocates who became Barristers in U.K. maintain their honorific title of barristers. In Bangladesh there is an association called Barristers Association of Bangladesh that represents the such U.K. bases barristers.       In Canada , the professions of barrister and solicitor are fused, and many lawyers refer to themselves with both names, even if they do not practise in both areas. Stephen Waddams, Introduction to the Study of Law, 7th ed at 128. In colloquial parlance within the Canadian legal profession, lawyers often term themselves as litigators , or as solicitors , depending on the nature of their law practice though some may in effect practise as both litigators and solicitors. However, litigators would generally perform all litigation functions traditionally performed by barristers and solicitors; in contrast, those terming themselves solicitors would generally limit themselves to legal work not involving practice before the courts , though some might practise before chambers judges. As is the practice in many other Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, Canadian litigators are gowned , but without a wig, when appearing before courts of superior jurisdiction . All law graduates from Canadian law schools, and holders of NCA certificates of Qualification from the Federation of Law Societies of Canada after can apply to the relevant Provincial regulating body for admission . Prerequisites to admission as a member to a law society involve the completion of a Canadian law degree , a year of articling as a student supervised by a qualified lawyer, and passing the bar exams mandated by the province the student has applied for a licence in. Once these requirements are complete then the articling student may be called to the bar after the review if their application and consideration of any good character issues at which they are presented to the Court in a call ceremony. The applicant then becomes a member of the law society as a barrister and solicitor .     The situation is somewhat different in Quebec as a result of its  |civil_law|Civil_Law|  tradition. The profession of solicitor, or avoué, never took hold in colonial Quebec, so attorneys Here the term attorney may be preferable as an avocat is very much like an American attorney in that he/she may be both a trial and case lawyer.  have traditionally been a fused profession, arguing and preparing cases in contentious matters, whereas Quebecs other type of lawyer,  |civil-law_notaries|Civil_Law_Notary|  , handle out-of-court non-contentious matters. However, a number of areas of non-contentious  |private_law|Private_Law|  are not monopolized by notaries so that attorneys often specialise in handling either trials, cases, advising, or non-trial matters. The only disadvantage is that attorneys cannot draw up  |public_instruments|Public_Instrument|  that have the same force of law as  |notarial_acts|Act| . Most large law firms in Quebec offer the full range of legal services of law firms in common-law provinces. Intending Quebec attorneys must earn a bachelors degree in civil law, pass the provincial bar examination, and successfully complete a legal internship to be admitted to practice. Attorneys are regulated by the Quebec Law Society .       In France, avocats, or attorneys, were, until the 20th century, the equivalent of barristers. The profession included several grades ranked by seniority: avocat-stagiaire , avocat, and avocat honoraire . Since the 14th century and during the course of the 19th and 20th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the conseil juridique and avoué , and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner, with the notable exception of notaires , who are ministry appointed lawyers and who retain exclusivity over conveyancing and probate. After the 1971 and 1990 legal reforms, the avocat was fused with the avoué and the conseil juridique, making the avocat  an all-purpose lawyer for matters of contentious jurisdiction, analogous to an American attorney. French attorneys usually do not act both as litigators and legal consultants , known respectively as avocat plaidant and avocat-conseil. This distinction is however purely informal and does not correspond to any difference in qualification or admission to the roll. All intending attorneys must pass an examination to be able to enrol in one of the Centre régional de formation à la profession davocat  . The CRFPA course has a duration of two years and is a mix between classroom teachings and internships. Its culmination is the stage final , where the intending attorney spends 6 months in a law firm . The intending attorney then needs to pass the Certificat dAptitude à la Profession dAvocat , which is the last professional examination allowing him/her to join a courts bar . It is generally recognised that the first examination is much more difficult than the CAPA and is dreaded by most law students. Each bar is regulated by a Bar Council .       In Germany, no distinction is made and lawyers may plead at all courts with the exception of the civil branch of the Federal Court of Justice  to which fewer than fifty lawyers are admitted. § 78 of the Zivilprozessordnung.  Those lawyers may not plead at other courts, almost only deal with litigation, and are usually instructed by a lawyer who represented the client in the lower courts. However, these restrictions do not apply to criminal cases, nor to pleadings at courts of the other court systems .          The legal profession in Hong Kong is also divided into two branches: barristers and solicitors.     In the  |High_Court|High_Court|  and the  |Court_of_Final_Appeal|Court_Of_Final_Appeal| , as a general rule, only barristers and  |solicitor-advocates|Solicitor-Advocate|  are allowed to speak on behalf of any party in open court. This means that solicitors are restricted from doing so. In these two courts, barristers dress in the traditional English manner, as do the judges and other lawyers.     In Hong Kong, the rank of Queens Counsel was granted prior to the  |transfer_of_the_sovereignty_of_Hong_Kong|Transfer_Of_The_Sovereignty_Of_Hong_Kong|  from the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  to  |China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  in 1997. After the handover, the rank has been replaced by  |Senior_Counsel|Senior_Counsel| |post-nominal_letters|Post-Nominal_Letters| |India|Law_Of_India| , the law relating to the Barrister is the Advocates Act, 1961 introduced and thought up by  |Ashoke_Kumar_Sen|Ashoke_Kumar_Sen| , the then law minister of India, which is a law passed by the Parliament and is administered and enforced by the  |Bar_Council_of_India|Bar_Council_Of_India| . Under the act, the Bar Council of India is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India is authorized to pass regulations and make orders in individual cases and also generally.     Each State has a Bar Council of its own whose function is to enroll the Barristers willing to practise predominately within the territorial confines of that State and to perform the functions of the Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a State Bar Council to practise in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Barrister from appearing before any court in India, even though it is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.   The advantage with having the State Bar Councils is that the workload of the Bar Council of India can be divided into these various State Bar Councils and also that matters can be dealt with locally and in an expedited manner. However, for all practical and legal purposes, the Bar Council of India retains with it, the final power to take decisions in any and all matters related to the legal profession on the whole or with respect to any   The process for being entitled to practise in India is twofold. First, the applicant must be a holder of a law degree from a recognized institution in India and second, must pass the enrollment qualifications of the Bar Council of the state where he/she seeks to be enrolled. For this purpose, the Bar Council of India has an internal Committee whose function is to supervise and examine the various institutions conferring law degrees and to grant recognition to these institutions once they meet the required standards. In this manner the Bar Council of India also ensures the standard of education required for practising in India is met with. As regards the qualification for enrollment with the State Bar Council, while the actual formalities may vary from one State to another, yet predominately they ensure that the application has not been a bankrupt /criminal and is generally fit to practise before courts of India.   Enrollment with a Bar Council also means that the law degree holder is recognized as a Barrister and is required to maintain a standards of conduct and professional demeanor at all times, both on and off the profession. The Bar Council of India also prescribes Rules of Conduct to be observed by the Barristers in the courts, while interacting with clients and even otherwise.       In the  |Republic_of_Ireland|Republic_Of_Ireland| , admission to the Bar by the Chief Justice of Ireland is restricted to those on whom a Barrister-at-Law degree has first been conferred.  |The_Honorable_Society_of_Kings_Inns|Kings_Inns|  Note: the historical spelling variant Honorable, not the contemporary Honourable is the only educational establishment which runs vocational courses for barristers in the Republic and degrees of Barrister-at-Law can only be conferred by Kings Inns. Kings Inns are also the only body with the capacity to call individuals to the bar and to disbar them.     Most Irish barristers choose to be governed thereafter by the  |Bar_Council_of_Ireland|Bar_Council_Of_Ireland| , a quasi-private entity. Senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar, when they may describe themselves as Senior Counsel . All barristers who have not been called to the Inner Bar are known as Junior Counsel , regardless of age or experience. Admission to the Inner Bar is made by declaration before the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_Ireland| ,  |patents_of_precedence|Patent_Of_Precedence|  having been granted by the  |Government|Government_Of_Ireland| . Irish barristers are sole practitioners and may not form chambers or partnerships if they wish to remain members of the Bar Councils Law Library.     To practise under the Bar Council of Irelands rules, a newly qualified barrister is apprenticed to an experienced barrister of at least seven years experience. This apprenticeship is known as  |pupillage|Pupillage|  or  |devilling|Devilling| . Devilling is compulsory for those barristers who wish to be members of the Law Library and lasts for one legal year. It is common to devil for a second year in a less formal arrangement but this is not compulsory. Devils are not generally paid for their work in their devilling year.       In Israel, there is no distinction between barristers and solicitors, even though the judicial system is based mostly on English common law, as a continuation of the  |British_Mandate_in_Palestine|British_Mandate_For_Palestine| .       Japan adopts a unified system. However, there are certain classes of qualified professionals who are allowed to practise in certain limited areas of law, such as scriveners , tax accountants  and patent agents . Only the lawyers  can appear before court and are qualified to practise in any areas of law, including, but not limited to, areas that those qualified law-related professionals above are allowed to practise. Most attorneys still focus primarily on court practice and still a very small number of attorneys give sophisticated and expert legal advice on a day-to-day basis to large corporations.       The  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  used to have a semi-separated legal profession comprising the lawyer and the procureur, the latter resembling, to some extent, the profession of barrister. Under that system, lawyers were entitled to represent their clients in law, but were only able to file cases before the court at which they were registered. Cases falling under the jurisdiction of another court had to be filed by a procureur registered at that court, in practice often another lawyer exercising both functions. Questions were raised on the necessity of the separation, given the fact that its main purpose – the preservation of the quality of the legal profession and observance of local court rules and customs – had become obsolete. For that reason, the procureur as a separate profession was abolished and its functions merged with the legal profession in 2008.  Currently, lawyers can file cases before any court, regardless of where they are registered. The only notable exception concerns cases brought before the  |Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_Netherlands| , which have to be handled by lawyers registered in the district of  |South_Holland|South_Holland| , mainly for qualitative reasons.       In New Zealand, the professions are not formally fused but practitioners are enrolled in the High Court as Barristers and Solicitors . They may choose, however, to practise as barristers sole. About 15% practise solely as barristers, mainly in the larger cities and usually in chambers . They receive instructions from other practitioners, at least nominally. They usually conduct the proceedings in their entirety.     Any lawyer may apply to become a  |Queens_Counsel|Queens_Counsel|  to recognize long-standing contribution to the legal profession but this status is only conferred on those practising as solicitors in exceptional circumstances. This step, referred to as being called to the inner bar or taking silk , is considered highly prestigious and has been a step in the career of many New Zealand judges.     Unlike other jurisdictions, the term junior barrister is popularly used to refer to a lawyer who holds a practising certificate as a barrister, but is employed by another, more senior barrister. Generally, junior barristers are within their first five years of practise and are not yet qualified to practise as barristers sole. Barristers sole who are not Queens Counsel are never referred to as junior barristers.       In  |Nigeria|Nigeria| , there is no formal distinction between barristers and solicitors. All students who pass the bar examinations – offered exclusively by the  |Nigerian_Law_School|Nigerian_Law_School|  – are called to the Nigerian bar, by the Body of Benchers. Lawyers may argue in any Federal trial or appellate court as well as any of the courts in Nigerias 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The Legal Practitioners Act, refers to Nigerian lawyers as Legal Practitioners, and following their  |call_to_the_Bar|Call_To_The_Bar| , Nigerian lawyers enter their names in the register or Roll of Legal Practitioners kept at the Supreme Court. Perhaps for this reason, a Nigerian lawyer is also often referred to as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, and many Nigerian lawyers term themselves Barrister-at-Law complete with the postnominal initials B.L. .     The vast majority of Nigerian lawyers combine contentious and non-contentious work, although there is a growing tendency for practitioners in the bigger practices to specialise in one or the other. In colloquial parlance within the Nigerian legal profession, lawyers may, for this reason, be referred to as litigators or as solicitors .     Consistent with the practice in England and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, senior members of the profession may be selected for elevation to the Inner Bar by conferment of the rank of  |Senior_Advocate_of_Nigeria|Senior_Advocate_Of_Nigeria|  .       In  |Pakistan|Law_Of_Pakistan|  to practice as a Barrister, law graduates have to complete three steps. They have to pass the Bar Practice and Training Course , be Called to the Bar by an Inn of Court from England and Wales and attain a licence to practice as an advocate in the Courts of Pakistan from the relevant Bar Council, provincial or federal. However the profession in Pakistan is fused and an advocate works both as a barrister and a solicitor, with higher rights of audience being provided.       In  |Poland|Poland| , there are two main types of legal professions:  |advocate|Advocate|  and legal counsel. Both are regulated and these professions are restricted only for people who graduated five-year law studies, have at least three years of experience and passed five difficult national exams or have a doctor of law degree. Before 2015, the only difference was that advocates have a right to represent clients before the court in all cases and the legal advisors could not represent clients before the court in criminal cases. Presently, the legal advisors can also represent clients in criminal cases so currently, the differences between this professions are only historical significance.          In  |South_Africa|South_Africa|  the employment and practise of advocates is consistent with the rest of the Commonwealth. Advocates carry the rank of Junior or Senior Counsel , and are mostly briefed and paid by solicitors . They are usually employed in the higher courts, particularly in the Appeal Courts where they often appear as specialist counsel. South African solicitors follow a practice of referring cases to Counsel for an opinion before proceeding with a case, when Counsel in question practises as a specialist in the case law at stake. Aspiring advocates currently spend one year in pupillage before being admitted to the bar in their respective provincial or judicial jurisdictions. The term Advocate is sometimes used in South Africa as a title, e. g. Advocate John Doe, SC in the same fashion as Dr. John Doe for a medical doctor.       In South Korea, there is no distinction between the judiciary and lawyers. Previously, a person who has passed the national bar exam after two years of national education is able to become a judge, prosecutor, or lawyer in accordance to their grades upon graduation. As a result of changes from implementing an accommodated law school system, there are two standard means of becoming a lawyer. Under the current legal system, to be a judge or a prosecutor, lawyers need to practise their legal knowledge. A lawyer does not have any limitation of practice.       Spain has a division but it does not correspond to the division in Britain between barristers/advocates and solicitors. Procuradores represent the litigant procedurally in court, generally under the authority of a power of attorney executed by a civil law notary, while abogados represent the substantive claims of the litigant through trial advocacy. Abogados perform both transactional work and advise in connection with court proceedings, and they have full right of audience in front of the court. The court proceeding is carried out with abogados, not with procuradores. In a nutshell, procuradores are court agents that operate under the instructions of an abogado. Their practice is confined to the locality of the court to which they are admitted.                 Although with somewhat different laws,  |England|England|  and  |Wales|Wales|  are considered within the United Kingdom  |a_single_united_and_unified_legal_jurisdiction|England_And_Wales|  for the purposes of both civil and criminal law, alongside Scotland and Northern Ireland, the other two legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom. England and Wales are covered by a common bar and a single law society .     The profession of barrister in England and Wales is a separate profession from that of solicitor. It is, however, possible to hold the qualification of both barrister and solicitor at the same time. It is not necessary to leave the bar to qualify as a solicitor.     Barristers are regulated by the  |Bar_Standards_Board|Bar_Standards_Board| , a division of the  |General_Council_of_the_Bar|General_Council_Of_The_Bar| . A barrister must be a member of one of the  |Inns_of_Court|Inns_Of_Court| , which traditionally educated and regulated barristers. There are four Inns of Court:  |The_Honourable_Society_of_Lincolns_Inn|Lincolns_Inn| ,  |The_Honourable_Society_of_Grays_Inn|Grays_Inn| ,  |The_Honourable_Society_of_the_Middle_Temple|Middle_Temple| , and  |The_Honourable_Society_of_the_Inner_Temple|Inner_Temple| . All are situated in central London, near the  |Royal_Courts_of_Justice|Royal_Courts_Of_Justice| . They perform scholastic and social roles, and in all cases, provide financial aid to student barristers through scholarships. It is the Inns that actually call the student to the Bar at a ceremony similar to a graduation. Social functions include dining with other members and guests and hosting other events.     Law graduates wishing to work and be known as barristers must take the  |Bar_Professional_Training_Course|Bar_Professional_Training_Course|  at one of the institutions authorised by the Bar Council to offer the BPTC. Qualification details of English Bar,  On successful completion of the BPTC student barristers are called to the bar by their respective inns and are elevated to the degree of Barrister . However, before they can practise independently they must first undertake 12 months of  |pupillage|Pupillage| . The first six months of this period is spent shadowing more senior practitioners, after which pupil barristers may begin to undertake some court work of their own. Following successful completion of this stage, most barristers then join a set of Chambers, a group of counsel who share the costs of premises and support staff whilst remaining individually self-employed.     In December 2014 there were just over 15,500 barristers in independent practice, of whom about ten percent are  |Queens_Counsel|Queens_Counsel|  and the remainder are  |junior_barristers|Junior_Barrister| . Many barristers are employed in companies as in-house counsel, or by local or national government or in academic institutions.     Certain barristers in England and Wales are now instructed directly by members of the public.   Members of the public may engage the services of the barrister directly within the framework of the  |Public_Access_Scheme|Public_Access_Scheme| ; a solicitor is not involved at any stage. Barristers undertaking public access work can provide legal advice and representation in court in almost all areas of law   and are entitled to represent clients in any court or tribunal in England and Wales. Once instructions from a client are accepted, it is the barrister who advises and guides the client through the relevant legal procedure or litigation.     Before a barrister can undertake Public Access work, they must have completed a special course. At present, about one in 20 barristers has so qualified. There is also a separate scheme called Licensed Access, available to certain nominated classes of professional client; it is not open to the general public. Public access work is experiencing a huge surge at the bar, with barristers taking advantage of the new opportunity for the bar to make profit in the face of legal aid cuts elsewhere in the profession.     The ability of barristers to accept such instructions is a recent development; it results from a change in the rules set down by the General Council of the Bar in July 2004. The Public Access Scheme has been introduced as part of the drive to open up the legal system to the public and to make it easier and cheaper to obtain access to legal advice. It further reduces the distinction between solicitors and barristers. The distinction remains however because there are certain aspects of a solicitors role that a barrister is not able to undertake.     Some honorific suffixes to signify notable barristers may be  Esquire .  Even though the term barrister-at-law is sometimes seen, and was once very common, it has never been formally correct in England and Wales. Barrister is the only correct nomenclature. This was confirmed by the Professional Conduct Committee of the Bar Council when it changed its rules on the usage of the description by individuals in 1970, Annual Statement of the Bar Council, 1969/70.

The term junior is often misleading since many members of the Junior Bar are experienced barristers with considerable expertise.      |Benchers|Bencher|  are, and have been for centuries, the governing bodies of the four  |Inns_of_Court|Inns_Of_Court|  in London and  |Kings_Inns|Kings_Inns| , Dublin. The Benchers of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland governed the Inn until the enactment of the Constitution of the Inn in 1983, which provides that the government of the Inn is shared between the Benchers, the Executive Council of the Inn and members of the Inn assembled in General Meeting.     The Executive Council is responsible for considering Memorials submitted by applicants for admission as students of the Inn and by Bar students of the Inn for admission to the degree of Barrister-at-Law and making recommendations to the Benchers. The final decisions on these Memorials are taken by the Benchers. The Benchers also have the exclusive power of expelling or suspending a Bar student and of disbarring a barrister or suspending a barrister from practice.     The Executive Council is also involved with: education; fees of students; calling counsel to the Bar, although call to the Bar is performed by the  |Lord_Chief_Justice_of_Northern_Ireland|Lord_Chief_Justice_Of_Northern_Ireland|  on the invitation of the Benchers; administration of the Bar Library ; and liaising with corresponding bodies in other countries.     The Bar Council is responsible for the maintenance of the standards, honour and independence of the Bar and, through its Professional Conduct Committee, receives and investigates complaints against members of the Bar in their professional capacity.

The legal profession includes both barristers and solicitors with most barristers also acting as solicitors. Admission and Disciplinary matters in Gibraltar are dealt with by the Bar Council of Gibraltar and the Supreme Court of Gibraltar. In order for barristers or solicitors to be admitted as practising lawyers in Gibraltar they must comply with the Supreme Court Act 1930 as amended by the Supreme Court Amendment Act 2015 which requires, amongst other things, for all newly admitted lawyers as of 1 July 2015 to undertake a years course in Gibraltar law at the University of Gibraltar. Solicitors also have right of audience in Gibraltars courts.       The United States does not draw a distinction between lawyers as pleaders and lawyers as agents . All lawyers who have passed a  |bar_examination|Bar_Examination|  and have been admitted to practice may prosecute or defend in the courts of the state where they are admitted. Historically, a distinction was made, and a separate label for barristers  existed in certain states, though both professions have long since been fused into the all-purpose attorney.

Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys to obtain a separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that courts bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted as a matter of course to any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located.
