   In  |geometry|Geometry| , an Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by  |Archimedes|Archimedes| . They are the  |convex|Convex_Polytope| |_uniform_polyhedra|Uniform_Polyhedron|  composed of  |regular_polygons|Regular_Polygon|  meeting in identical  |vertices|Vertex| , excluding the 5  |Platonic_solids|Platonic_Solid|  and excluding the prisms and antiprisms. They differ from the  |Johnson_solids|Johnson_Solid| , whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.     Identical vertices means that each two vertices are symmetric to each other: A global  |isometry|Isometry|  of the entire solid takes one vertex to the other while laying the solid directly on its initial position.  observed that a 14th polyhedron, the  |elongated_square_gyrobicupola|Elongated_Square_Gyrobicupola|  , meets a weaker definition of an Archimedean solid, in which identical vertices means merely that the faces surrounding each vertex are of the same types , so only a local isometry is required. Grünbaum pointed out a frequent error in which authors define Archimedean solids using this local definition but omit the 14th polyhedron. If only 13 polyhedra are to be listed, the definition must use global symmetries of the polyhedron rather than local neighborhoods.      |Prisms|Prism|  and  |antiprisms|Antiprism| , whose  |symmetry_groups|Symmetry_Group|  are the  |dihedral_groups|Dihedral_Group| , are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, even though their faces are regular polygons and their symmetry groups act transitively on their vertices. Excluding these two infinite families, there are 13 Archimedean solids. All the Archimedean solids can be made via  |Wythoff_constructions|Wythoff_Construction|  from the Platonic solids with  |tetrahedral|Tetrahedral_Symmetry| ,  |octahedral|Octahedral_Symmetry|  and  |icosahedral_symmetry|Icosahedral_Symmetry| .       The Archimedean solids take their name from  |Archimedes|Archimedes| , who discussed them in a now-lost work.  |Pappus|Pappus_Of_Alexandria|  refers to it, stating that Archimedes listed 13 polyhedra. . During the  |Renaissance|Renaissance| ,  |artists|Artist|  and  |mathematicians|Mathematician|  valued pure forms with high symmetry, and by around 1620  |Johannes_Kepler|Johannes_Kepler|  had completed the rediscovery of the 13 polyhedra, Field J., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler, Archive for History of Exact Sciences, 50, 1997, 227 as well as defining the  |prisms|Prism| ,  |antiprisms|Antiprisms| , and the non-convex solids known as  |Kepler_Poinsot_polyhedra|Kepler_Poinsot_Polyhedra| .
