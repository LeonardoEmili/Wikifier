However, Augustine was not a resident of the Holy Land and therefore was not familiar with the local populations and their oral traditions. Gradually, paintings of Jesus took on characteristics of portrait images.     At this time the manner of depicting Jesus was not yet uniform, and there was some controversy over which of the two most common icons was to be favored. The first or Semitic form showed Jesus with short and frizzy hair; the second showed a bearded Jesus with hair parted in the middle, the manner in which the god Zeus was depicted. Theodorus Lector remarked Church History 1:15. that of the two, the one with short and frizzy hair was more authentic . To support his assertion, he relates a story that a pagan commissioned to paint an image of Jesus used the Zeus form instead of the Semitic form, and that as punishment his hands withered.

In the post-Justinianic period the icon assumes an ever increasing role in popular devotion, and there is a proliferation of miracle stories connected with icons, some of them rather shocking to our eyes .   However, the earlier references by Eusebius and Irenaeus indicate veneration of images and reported miracles associated with them as early as the 2nd century. What might be shocking to our contemporary eyes may not have been viewed as such by the early Christians.   Acts 5:15 reports that people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peters shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.       In the icons of Eastern Orthodoxy, and of the Early Medieval West, very little room is made for artistic license. Almost everything within the image has a symbolic aspect. Christ, the saints, and the angels all have halos. Angels  have wings because they are messengers.

These Truths We Hold, St. Tikhons Seminary Press, 1986. Eastern Orthodoxy further teaches that a clear understanding of the importance of Icons was part of the church from its very beginning, and has never changed, although explanations of their importance may have developed over time. This is because icon painting is rooted in the theology of the Incarnation  which didnt change, though its subsequent clarification within the Church occurred over the period of the first seven Ecumenical Councils. Also, icons served as tools of edification for the illiterate faithful during most of the history of Christendom. Thus, icons are words in painting; they refer to the history of salvation and to its manifestation in concrete persons. In the Orthodox Church icons have always been understood as a visible gospel, as a testimony to the great things given man by God the incarnate Logos  In the Council of 860 it was stated that all that is uttered in words written in syllables is also proclaimed in the language of colors . Mansi xvi. 40D. See also Evdokimov, L Orthodoxie , p. 222.     Eastern Orthodox find the first instance of an image or icon in the Bible when God made man in His own image , in Genesis 1:26–27. In Exodus, God commanded that the Israelites not make any graven image; but soon afterwards, he commanded that they make graven images of cherubim and other like things, both as statues and woven on tapestries. Later, Solomon included still more such imagery when he built the first temple. Eastern Orthodox believe these qualify as icons, in that they were visible images depicting heavenly beings and, in the case of the cherubim, used to indirectly indicate Gods presence above the Ark.     In the Book of Numbers it is written that God told Moses to make a bronze serpent,  Nehushtan , and hold it up, so that anyone looking at the snake would be healed of their snakebites. In John 3, Jesus refers to the same serpent, saying that he must be lifted up in the same way that the serpent was. ": null
