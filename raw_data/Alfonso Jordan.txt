Alfonso Jordan, also spelled Alfons Jordan or Alphonse Jourdain , was the  |Count_of_Tripoli|Count_Of_Tripoli|  ,  |Count_of_Rouergue|Count_Of_Rouergue|  and  |Count_of_Toulouse|Count_Of_Toulouse| ,  |Margrave_of_Provence|Margrave_Of_Provence|  and  |Duke_of_Narbonne|Duke_Of_Narbonne|  .     He was the son of  |Raymond_IV_of_Toulouse|Raymond_Iv_Of_Toulouse|  by his third wife,  |Elvira_of_Castile|Elvira_Of_Castile_Countess_Of_Toulouse| . He was born in the castle of Mont Pèlerin in  |Tripoli|Tripoli_Lebanon|  while his father was on the  |First_Crusade|First_Crusade| . He was given the name Jourdain after being baptised in the  |Jordan_River|Jordan_River| .     Alfonsos father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin,  |William_Jordan|Guillaume_Jourdain| ,  |Count_of_Cerdagne|Count_Of_Cerdagne| , until he was five. He was then taken to Europe, where his half-brother  |Bertrand|Bertrand_Of_Toulouse|  had given him the county of Rouergue. Upon Bertrands death in 1112, Alfonso succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of Provence.     In 1114, Duke  |William_IX_of_Aquitaine|William_Ix_Of_Aquitaine| , who claimed Toulouse by right of his wife Philippa, daughter of Count  |William_IV|William_Iv_Of_Toulouse| , invaded the county and conquered it. Alfonso recovered a part in 1119, but he was not in full control until 1123. When at last successful, he was  |excommunicated|Excommunicated|  by  |Pope_Callixtus_II|Pope_Callixtus_Ii|  for having expelled the monks of  |Saint_Gilles|Saint_Gilles_Gard| , who had aided his enemies.          Alfonso next had to fight for his rights in Provence against Count  |Raymond_Berengar_III_of_Barcelona|Raymond_Berengar_Iii_Of_Barcelona| . Not until September 1125 did their war end in peace and concord . Adam Kosto, Making Agreements in Medieval Catalonia: Power, Order, and the Written Word, 1000–1200 , 256–58. At this stage, Alfonso was master of the regions lying between the  |Pyrenees|Pyrenees|  and the  |Alps|Alps| , the  |Auvergne|Auvergne|  and the sea. His ascendancy was, according to one commentator, an unmixed good to the country, for during a period of fourteen years art and industry flourished.   In March 1126, Alfonso was at the court of  |Alfonso_VII_of_León|Alfonso_Vii_Of_León|  when he acceded to the throne.   According to the  Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris , Alfonso and  |Suero_Vermúdez|Suero_Vermúdez|  took the city of  |León|León_León|  from opposition magnates and handed it over to Alfonso VII. Among those who may have accompanied Alfonso on one of his many extended stays in Spain was the troubadour  |Marcabru|Marcabru| .          About 1134 Alfonso seized the  |viscounty_of_Narbonne|Viscount_Of_Narbonne|  and ruled it during the minority of the Viscountess  |Ermengarde|Ermengarde_Of_Narbonne| , only restoring it to her in 1143.   In 1141 King  |Louis_VII|Louis_Vii_Of_France|  pressed the claim of Philippa on behalf of his wife,  |Eleanor_of_Aquitaine|Eleanor_Of_Aquitaine| , even besieging Toulouse, but without result.   That same year Alfonso Jordan was again in Spain, making a  |pilgrimage_to_Saint_James_of_Compostela|Way_Of_Saint_James| , when he proposed a peace between the king of León and  |García_VI_of_Navarre|García_Ramírez_Of_Navarre| , which became the basis for subsequent negotiations.     In 1144, Alfonso again incurred the displeasure of the church by siding with the citizens of  |Montpellier|Montpellier|  against  |their_lord|Lord_Of_Montpellier| .   In 1145,  |Bernard_of_Clairvaux|Bernard_Of_Clairvaux|  addressed a letter to him full of concern about a heretic named Henry in the diocese of Toulouse.   Bernard even went there to preach against the heresy, an early expression of  |Catharism|Catharism| . Walter Leggett Wakefield and Austin Patterson Evans, Heresies of the High Middle Ages , 122.   A second time he was excommunicated; but in 1146 he took the cross at a meeting in  |Vézelay|Vézelay|  called by Louis VII.   In August 1147, he embarked for the near east on the  |Second_Crusade|Second_Crusade| .   He lingered on the way in Italy and probably in  |Constantinople|Constantinople| , where he may have met the Emperor  |Manuel_I|Manuel_I_Comnenus| .     Alfonso finally arrived at  |Acre|Acre_Palestine|  in 1148.   Among his companions he had made enemies and he was destined to take no share in the crusade he had joined.   He died at  |Caesarea|Caesarea| , and there were accusations of poisoning, usually levelled either against Eleanor of Aquitaine, wife of Louis, or  |Melisende|Melisende_Of_Jerusalem| , the mother of King  |Baldwin_III_of_Jerusalem|Baldwin_Iii_Of_Jerusalem| , who may have wanted to eliminate him as a rival to her brother-in-law  |Raymond_II|Raymond_Ii_Count_Of_Tripoli| .   By his wife since 1125, Faydiva dUzès, he left two legitimate sons:  |Raymond|Raymond_V_Of_Toulouse| , who succeeded him, and Alfonso. His daughter  |Faydiva|Faidiva_Of_Toulouse|  married Count  |Humbert_III_of_Savoy|Humbert_Iii_Of_Savoy| . He left two other daughters: the legitimate Agnes and the illegitimate Laurentia, who married Count  |Bernard_III_of_Comminges|Bernard_Iii_Of_Comminges| .
