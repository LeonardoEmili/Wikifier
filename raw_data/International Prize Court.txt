The International Prize Court was an  |international_court|International_Judicial_Institutions|  proposed at the beginning of the 20th century, to hear  |prize_cases|Prize_Court| . An international agreement to create it, the Convention Relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court, was made at the  |Second_Hague_Conference|Second_Hague_Conference|  in 1907 but never came into force.     The capturing of  |prizes|Prize|  during wartime is a tradition that goes back as far as organized warfare itself. The International Prize Court was to hear  |appeals|Appellate_Court|  from national courts concerning prize cases. Even as a draft, the convention was innovative for the time, in being both the first ever treaty for a truly international court , and in providing individuals with  |access_to_the_court|Locus_Standi| , going against the prevailing doctrines of  |international_law|International_Law|  at the time, according to which only states had rights and duties under international law. The Convention was opposed, particularly by elements within the  |United_States|United_States|  and the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , as a violation of  |national_sovereignty|National_Sovereignty| .     The 1907 convention was modified by the Additional Protocol to the Convention Relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court, done at the Hague on October 18, 1910. The protocol was an attempt to resolve some concerns expressed by the United States at the court, which felt it to be in violation of  |its_constitutional|United_States_Constitution|  provision that provides for the  |U.S._Supreme_Court|U.S._Supreme_Court|  being the final judicial authority. However, neither the convention nor the subsequent protocol ever entered into force, since only  |Nicaragua|Nicaragua|  ratified the agreements. As a result, the court never came into existence.     A number of ideas from the International Prize Court proposal can be seen in present day international courts, such as its provision for judges ad hoc, later adopted in the  |Permanent_Court_of_International_Justice|Permanent_Court_Of_International_Justice|  and the subsequent  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice|.
