Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance.

During most performances, the performer holds the character above their head or in front of their body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or – in the case of live-hand Muppets – wearing the hands similarly to gloves. One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.     For more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character.

They are also test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match .  When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.                    On September 17, 2002, ": null
