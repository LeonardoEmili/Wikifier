   Balmoral Castle  is a large  |estate_house|Estate_House|  in  |Royal_Deeside|Royal_Deeside| ,  |Aberdeenshire|Aberdeenshire| , Scotland, near the village of  |Crathie|Crathie| ,  west of  |Ballater|Ballater|  and  east of  |Braemar|Braemar| .     Balmoral has been one of the  |residences|List_Of_British_Royal_Residences|  of the  |British_royal_family|British_Royal_Family|  since 1852, when the estate and its original castle were purchased privately by  |Prince_Albert|Albert_Prince_Consort| , the husband of  |Queen_Victoria|Queen_Victoria| . It remains private property of the royal family and is not part of the  |Crown_Estate|Crown_Estate| .     Soon after the estate was purchased by the royal family, the existing house was found to be too small and the current Balmoral Castle was commissioned. The architect was  |William_Smith|William_Smith|  of Aberdeen, although his designs were amended by Prince Albert.     The castle is an example of  |Scottish_baronial_architecture|Scottish_Baronial_Architecture| , and is classified by  |Historic_Environment_Scotland|Historic_Environment_Scotland|  as a  |category_A_listed|Category_A_Listed|  building.  The new castle was completed in 1856 and the old castle demolished shortly thereafter.     The Balmoral  |Estate|Estate|  has been added to by successive members of the royal family, and now covers an area of approximately . It is a working estate, including  |grouse_moors|Red_Grouse| , forestry, and farmland, as well as managed herds of deer,  |Highland_cattle|Highland_Cattle| , and ponies.               |King_Robert_II|Robert_Ii_Of_Scotland|  of Scotland had a  |hunting_lodge|Hunting|  in the area. Historical records also indicate that a house at Balmoral was built by Sir William Drummond in 1390.  The estate is recorded in 1451 as Bouchmorale , and later was tenanted by Alexander Gordon, second son of the  |1st_Earl_of_Huntly|Alexander_Gordon_1St_Earl_Of_Huntly| . A  |tower_house|Tower_Houses_In_Britain_And_Ireland|  was built on the estate by the Gordons.      In 1662, the estate passed to Charles Farquharson of  |Inverey|Inverey| , brother of  |John_Farquharson|John_Farquharson_3Rd_Of_Inverey| , the Black Colonel . The Farquharsons were  |Jacobite|Jacobitism|  sympathisers, and James Farquharson of Balmoral was involved in both the 1715 and 1745  |rebellions|Jacobite_Risings| . He was wounded at the  |Battle_of_Falkirk|Battle_Of_Falkirk|  in 1746. The Farquharson estates were  |forfeit|Wikt_Forfeit| , and passed to the Farquharsons of  |Auchendryne|Braemar| .  In 1798,  |James_Duff_2nd_Earl_Fife|James_Duff_2Nd_Earl_Fife| , acquired Balmoral and leased the castle.  |Sir_Robert_Gordon|Robert_Gordon| , a younger brother of the  |4th_Earl_of_Aberdeen|George_Gordon_4Th_Earl_Of_Aberdeen| , acquired the lease in 1830. He made major alterations to the original castle at Balmoral, including baronial-style extensions that were designed by  |John_Smith|John_Smith|  of Aberdeen.         Queen Victoria and Prince Albert first visited Scotland in 1842, five years after her accession to the throne and two years after their marriage. During this first visit they stayed at  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| , and at  |Taymouth_Castle|Taymouth_Castle|  in  |Perthshire|Perthshire| , the home of the  |Marquess_of_Breadalbane|John_Campbell_2Nd_Marquess_Of_Breadalbane| . They returned in 1844 to stay at  |Blair_Castle|Blair_Castle|  and, in 1847, when they rented Ardverikie by  |Loch_Laggan|Loch_Laggan| . Millar, pp.23,31 During the latter trip they encountered weather that was extremely rainy, which led  |Sir_James_Clark|James_Clark| , the queens doctor, to recommend  |Deeside|River_Dee_Aberdeenshire|  instead, for its more healthy climate. Millar, p.39     Sir Robert Gordon died in 1847 and his lease on Balmoral reverted to Lord Aberdeen. In February 1848 an arrangement was made—that Prince Albert would acquire the remaining part of the lease on Balmoral, together with its furniture and staff—without having seen the property first.           The royal couple arrived for their first visit on 8 September 1848. Millar, pp.40–41 Victoria found the house small but pretty , Millar, p.41 and recorded in her diary that: All seemed to breathe freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils . The surrounding hilly landscape reminded them of  |Thuringia|Thuringia| , Alberts homeland in Germany.      Quickly, the house was confirmed to be too small and, in 1848, John and William Smith were commissioned to design new offices, cottages, and other ancillary buildings. Improvements to the woodlands, gardens, and estate buildings also were being made, with the assistance of the landscape gardener, James Beattie, and possibly by the painter,  |James_Giles|James_Giles| .     Major additions to the old house were considered in 1849, Millar, p.55 but by then negotiations were under way to purchase the estate from the trustees of the deceased Earl Fife. After seeing a  |corrugated_iron|Corrugated_Iron|  cottage at the  |Great_Exhibition_of_1851|Great_Exhibition_Of_1851| , Prince Albert ordered a pre-fabricated iron building for Balmoral from E. T. Bellhouse & Co., to serve as a temporary ballroom and dining room.  It was in use by 1 October 1851, and would serve as a ballroom until 1856. Millar, p.59     The sale was completed in June 1852, the price being £32,000, and Prince Albert formally took possession that autumn.  Millar, p.56 The neighbouring estate of  |Birkhall|Birkhall|  was bought at the same time, and the lease on  |Abergeldie_Castle|Abergeldie_Castle|  secured as well. To mark the occasion, the  Purchase Cairn  was erected in the hills overlooking the castle, the first of many.              The growing family of Victoria and Albert, the need for additional staff, and the quarters required for visiting friends and official visitors such as cabinet members, however, meant that extension of the existing structure would not be sufficient and that a larger house needed to be built. In early 1852, this was commissioned from William Smith. The son of John Smith , William Smith was city architect of  |Aberdeen|Aberdeen|  from 1852. On learning of the commission,  |William_Burn|William_Burn|  sought an interview with the prince, apparently to complain that Smith previously had plagiarised his work, however, Burn was unsuccessful in depriving Smith of the appointment.  William Smiths designs were amended by Prince Albert, who took a close interest in details such as turrets and windows. Millar, p.57          Construction began during summer 1853, on a site some  northwest of the original building that was considered to have a better vista. Millar, pp.56–57 Another reason for consideration was, that whilst construction was ongoing, the family would still be able to use the old house.  Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone on 28 September 1853, during her annual autumn visit. Millar, p.58 By the autumn of 1855, the royal apartments were ready for occupancy, although the tower was still under construction and the servants had to be lodged in the old house. By coincidence, shortly after their arrival at the estate that autumn, news circulated about the fall of  |Sevastopol|Siege_Of_Sevastopol| , ending the Crimean War, resulting in wild celebrations by royalty and locals alike. While visiting the estate shortly thereafter,  |Prince_Frederick_of_Prussia|Frederick_Iii_German_Emperor|  asked for the hand of  |Princess_Victoria|Victoria_Princess_Royal| .           The new house was completed in 1856, and the old castle subsequently was demolished. By autumn 1857, a new bridge across the Dee, designed by  |Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel|Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel|  linking Crathie and Balmoral was finished.      Balmoral Castle is built from  |granite|Granite|  quarried at Invergelder on the estate,  It consists of two main blocks, each arranged around a courtyard. The southwestern block contains the main rooms, while the northeastern contains the service wings. At the southeast is an  tall clock tower topped with turrets, one of which has a balustrade similar to a feature at  |Castle_Fraser|Castle_Fraser| .  Being similar in style to the demolished castle of the 1830s, the architecture of the new house is considered to be somewhat dated for its time when contrasted with the richer forms of  |Scots_Baronial|Scots_Baronial|  being developed by William Burn and others during the 1850s.  As an exercise in Scots Baronial, it sometimes is described as being too ordered, pedantic, and even,  |Germanic|Architecture_Of_Germany| —as a consequence of Prince Alberts influence on the design.     The purchase of a Scottish estate by Victoria and Albert and their adoption of a Scottish architectural style, however, was very influential for the ongoing revival of  |Highland_culture|Highland_Culture| . They decorated Balmoral with tartans and attended  |highland_games|Highland_Games|  at Braemar. Queen Victoria expressed an affinity for Scotland, even professing herself to be a  |Jacobite|Jacobitism| .  Added to the work of  |Sir_Walter_Scott|Sir_Walter_Scott| , this became a major factor in promoting the adoption of  |Highland_culture|Highland_Culture|  by  |Lowland_Scots|Lowland_Scotland| . Historian Michael Lynch comments that the Scottishness of Balmoral helped to give the monarchy a truly British dimension for the first time .             Even before the completion of the new house, the pattern of the life of the royal couple in the Highlands was soon established. Victoria took long walks of up to four hours daily and Albert spent many days hunting deer and game. In 1849, diarist  |Charles_Greville|Charles_Greville|  described their life at Balmoral as resembling that of gentry rather than royalty. Millar, p.44 Victoria began a policy of commissioning artists to record Balmoral, its surroundings, and its staff. Over the years, numerous painters were employed at Balmoral, including  |Edwin|Edwin_Landseer|  and  |Charles_Landseer|Charles_Landseer| ,  |Carl_Haag|Carl_Haag| ,  |William_Wyld|William_Wyld| , and  |William_Henry_Fisk|William_Henry_Fisk| . Millar, passim The royal couple took great interest in their staff. They established a lending library.     During the 1850s, new plantations were established near the house and exotic conifers were planted on the grounds. Prince Albert had an active role in these improvements, overseeing the design of  |parterres|Parterre| , the diversion of the main road north of the river via a new bridge, and plans for farm buildings. These buildings included a  |model_dairy|Model_Farm|  that he developed during 1861, the year of his death. The dairy was completed by Victoria. Subsequently, she also built several monuments to her husband on the estate. These include a pyramid-shaped cairn built a year after Alberts death, on top of Craig Lurachain. A large statue of Albert with a dog and a gun by  |William_Theed|William_Theed| , was inaugurated on 15 October 1867, the twenty-eighth anniversary of their engagement.   Millar, p.102          Following Alberts death, Victoria spent increasing periods at Balmoral, staying for as long as four months a year during early summer and autumn. Few further changes were made to the grounds, with the exception of some alterations to mountain paths, the erection of various cairns and monuments, and the addition of some cottages  built for senior staff.  It was during this period that Victoria began to depend on her servant,  |John_Brown|John_Brown| . He was a local  |ghillie|Wikt_Gillie|  from Crathie, who became one of her closest companions during her long mourning.      In 1887, Balmoral Castle was the birthplace of  |Victoria_Eugenie|Victoria_Eugenie_Of_Battenberg| , a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She was born to  |Princess_Beatrice|Princess_Beatrice_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , the fifth daughter of Victoria and Albert. Victoria Eugenie would become the queen of Spain.     In September 1896, Victoria welcomed  |Emperor_Nicholas_II_of_Russia|Nicholas_Ii_Of_Russia|  and  |Empress_Alexandra|Alexandra_Feodorovna|  to Balmoral. Four years later Victoria made her last visit to the estate, three months before her death on 22 January 1901.              After Victorias death, the royal family continued to use Balmoral during annual autumn visits.  |George_V|George_V|  had substantial improvements made during the 1910s and 1920s, including formal gardens to the south of the castle.     During the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , royal visits to Balmoral ceased. In addition, due to the enmity with Germany, Danzig Shiel, a lodge built by Victoria in Ballochbuie was renamed Garbh Allt Shiel and the King of Prussias Fountain was removed from the grounds.      Since the 1950s,  |Prince_Philip|Prince_Philip_Duke_Of_Edinburgh|  has added herbaceous borders and a water garden. During the 1980s new staff buildings were built close to the castle.          Though called a castle, Balmorals primary function is that of a country house.  It is a typical and rather ordinary country house from the Victorian period. The tower and pepper pot turrets are characteristic features of the residences Scottish Baronial style. The seven-storey tower is an architectural feature borrowed from medieval defensive  |tower_houses|Tower_House| . The pepper pot turrets were influenced by the style of 16th-century French  |château|Château| x. Other features of the Scottish Baronial style are the  |crow_stepped_gables|Crow_Stepped_Gable| ,  |dormer|Dormer|  windows, and  |battlement|Battlement| ed  |porte_cochère|Porte_Cochère| .        Balmoral is a private property and, unlike the monarchs  |official_residences|Official_Residence| , is not the property of  |the_Crown|The_Crown| . It originally was purchased personally by Prince Albert, rather than the queen, meaning that no revenues from the estate go to Parliament or to the public purse, as would otherwise be the case for property owned outright by the monarch in accord with the  |Civil_List_Act_1760|Civil_List_Act_1760| . Along with  |Sandringham_House|Sandringham_House|  in Norfolk, ownership of Balmoral was inherited by  |Edward_VIII|Edward_Viii|  on his accession in 1936. When he  |abdicated|Edward_Viii_Abdication_Crisis|  later the same year, however, he retained ownership of them. A financial settlement was devised, under which Balmoral and Sandringham were purchased by Edwards brother and successor to the Crown,  |George_VI|George_Vi| .      Currently, the estate is still owned outright by the monarch, but is managed by Trustees under Deeds of Nomination and Appointment.              Balmoral Estate is within the  |Cairngorms_National_Park|Cairngorms_National_Park|  and is partly within the Deeside and Lochnagar  |National_Scenic_Area|National_Scenic_Area| .
