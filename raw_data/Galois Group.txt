In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , more specifically in the area of  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra|  known as  |Galois_theory|Galois_Theory| , the Galois group of a certain type of  |field_extension|Field_Extension|  is a specific  |group|Group|  associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the  |polynomials|Polynomial|  that give rise to them via Galois groups is called  |Galois_theory|Galois_Theory| , so named in honor of  |Évariste_Galois|Évariste_Galois|  who first discovered them.     For a more elementary discussion of Galois groups in terms of  |permutation_groups|Permutation_Group| , see the article on  |Galois_theory|Galois_Theory| .         Suppose that  is an  |extension|Field_Extension|  of the  |field|Field|   . An  |automorphism|Automorphism|  of  is defined to be an automorphism of  that fixes  pointwise. In other words, an automorphism of  is an  |isomorphism|Isomorphism|   from  to  such that  for each . The set of all automorphisms of  forms a group with the operation of  |function_composition|Function_Composition| . This group is sometimes denoted by .     If  is a  |Galois_extension|Galois_Extension| , then  is called the Galois group of  over , and is usually denoted by . Some authors refer to  as the Galois group for arbitrary extensions  and use the corresponding notation, e.g. .     If  is not a  |Galois_extension|Galois_Extension| , then the Galois group of  over  is sometimes defined as , where  is the  |Galois_closure|Galois_Closure|  of .       In the following examples  is a field, and , ,  are the fields of  |complex|Complex_Number| ,  |real|Real_Number| , and  |rational|Rational_Number|  numbers, respectively. The notation  indicates the  |field_extension|Field_Extension|  obtained by  |adjoining|Adjunction|  an element  to the field .      is the trivial group that has a single element, namely the identity automorphism.    has two elements, the identity automorphism and the  |complex_conjugation|Complex_Conjugation|  automorphism. .    is trivial. Indeed, it can be shown that any automorphism of  must preserve the  |ordering|Order_Theory|  of the real numbers and hence must be the identity.    is an infinite group.    has two elements, the identity automorphism and the automorphism which exchanges + and −.   Consider the field . The group  contains only the identity automorphism. This is because  is not a  |normal_extension|Normal_Extension| , since the other two complex cube roots of 2 are missing from the extension—in other words  is not a  |splitting_field|Splitting_Field| .   Consider now , where  is a  |primitive_cube_root_of_unity|Root_Of_Unity| . The group  is isomorphic to , the  |dihedral_group_of_order_6|Dihedral_Group_Of_Order_6| , and  is in fact the splitting field of  over .   If  is a prime power, and if  and  denote the  |Galois_fields|Finite_Field|  of order  and  respectively, then  is cyclic of order  and generated by the  |Frobenius_homomorphism|Frobenius_Homomorphism| .   If  is an  |irreducible_polynomial|Irreducible_Polynomial|  of prime degree  with rational coefficients and exactly two nonreal roots, then the Galois group of  is the full  |symmetric_group|Symmetric_Group|  .       The significance of an extension being Galois is that it obeys the  |fundamental_theorem_of_Galois_theory|Fundamental_Theorem_Of_Galois_Theory|  subgroups of the Galois group correspond to the intermediate fields of the field extension.     If  is a Galois extension, then  can be given a  |topology|Topological_Space| , called the Krull topology, that makes it into a  |profinite_group|Profinite_Group| .
