            A game show is a type of radio, television, or stage show in which contestants, individually or as teams, play a  |game|Game|  which involves answering questions or solving puzzles, usually for money or prizes. Alternatively, a gameshow can be a  |demonstrative_program|Lets_Play|  about a game In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and  |goods_and_services|Goods_And_Services|  provided by the shows  |sponsor|Sponsor|  prize suppliers.              Game shows began to appear on radio and television in the late 1930s. The very first television game show,  Spelling Bee , as well as the first radio game show,  Information Please , were both broadcast in 1938; the first major success in the game show genre was  Dr. I.Q. , a radio quiz show that began in 1939.  Truth or Consequences  was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television; the  CBS Television Quiz  followed shortly thereafter. Its first episode aired in 1941 as an experimental broadcast. Over the course of the 1950s, as television began to pervade the popular culture, game shows quickly became a fixture. Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives. Higher-stakes programs would air in  |primetime|Primetime| . During the late 1950s, high-stakes games such as  Twenty-One  and  The $64,000 Question  began a rapid rise in popularity. However, the rise of quiz shows proved to be short-lived. In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were  |discovered_to_be_rigged|Quiz_Show_Scandals|  and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled.     An early variant of the game show, the  |panel_game|Panel_Game| , survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like  Whats My Line? ,  Ive Got A Secret , and  To Tell the Truth , panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as  Match Game  and  Hollywood Squares . In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nations top stand-up comedians on shows such as  Have I Got News for You ,  Would I Lie to You? ,  Mock the Week ,  QI , and  8 Out of 10 Cats , all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.       Game shows remained a fixture of US daytime television through the 1960s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 1960s; examples include  Jeopardy!  which began in 1964 and the original version of The Match Game first aired in 1962.  Lets Make a Deal  began in 1963 and the 1960s also marked the debut of Hollywood Squares,  Password ,  The Dating Game , and  The Newlywed Game .     Though  |CBS|Cbs|  gave up on daytime game shows in 1968, the other networks did not follow suit.  |Color_television|Color_Television|  was introduced to the game show genre in the late 1960s on all three networks. The 1970s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks.  The New Price Is Right , an update of the 1950s-era game show  The Price Is Right , debuted in 1972 and marked CBSs return to the game show format in its  |effort_to_draw_wealthier,_suburban_viewers|Rural_Purge| . The Match Game became Big Money  Match Game 73, which proved popular enough to prompt a spin-off,  Family Feud , on ABC in 1976.  The $10,000 Pyramid  and its numerous higher-stakes derivatives also debuted in 1973, while the 1970s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and  |host|Game_Show_Host| |Jack_Barry|Jack_Barry| , who debuted  The Jokers Wild  and a clean version of the previously rigged  Tic-Tac-Dough  in the 1970s.  Wheel of Fortune  debuted on NBC in 1975. The  |Prime_Time_Access_Rule|Prime_Time_Access_Rule| , which took effect in 1971, barred networks from broadcasting in the 7–8 p.m. time slot immediately preceding  |prime_time|Prime_Time| , opening up time slots for  |syndicated|Broadcast_Syndication|  programming. Most of the syndicated programs were nighttime adaptations of network daytime game shows. These game shows originally aired once a week, but by the late 1970s and early 1980s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week.       Game shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful. Most tapes were  |destroyed|Wipinggame_Shows|  until the early 1980s. Over the course of the late 1980s and early 1990s, as fewer new hits were produced, game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup. ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid-1980s . NBCs game block also lasted until 1991, but the network attempted to bring them back in 1993 before cancelling its game show block again in 1994. CBS phased out most of its game shows, except for The Price Is Right, by 1993. To the benefit of the genre, the moves of Wheel of Fortune and a modernized revival of Jeopardy! to  |syndication|Broadcast_Syndication|  in 1983 and 1984, respectively, was and remains highly successful; the two are, to this day, fixtures in the prime time access period .      |Cable_television|Cable_Television|  also allowed for the debut of game shows such as  Supermarket Sweep  and  Debt  ,  Trivial Pursuit  and  Family Challenge  , and  Double Dare  . It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns. General interest networks such as  |CBN_Cable_Network|Television_Networks_Preceding_Abc_Family|  and  |USA_Network|Usa_Network|  had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid-1980s to the mid-90s before that  |niche|Niche_Market|  was overtaken by  |Game_Show_Network|Game_Show_Network|  in 1994.     In the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom| , game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the 1990s as they did in the United States, due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the  |Independent_Broadcasting_Authority|Independent_Broadcasting_Authority|  in the 1980s and that those restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, allowing for higher-stakes games to be played.     After the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid-1990s United States , the British game show  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  began distribution around the globe. Upon the shows American debut in 1999, it was a hit and became a regular part of ABCs primetime lineup until 2002; that show would eventually air in syndication for seventeen years afterward. Several shorter-lived high-stakes games were attempted around the time of the  |millennium|Millennium| , both in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as  Winning Lines ,  The Chair ,  Greed ,  Paranoia , and  Shafted , leading to some dubbing this period as The Million-Dollar Game Show Craze . The boom quickly went bust, as by July 2000, almost all of the imitator million-dollar shows were canceled ; these higher stakes contests nevertheless opened the door to  |reality_television|Reality_Television|  contests such as  Survivor  and  Big Brother , in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment. Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well, such as Family Feud, Hollywood Squares, and Millionaire.       In the U.S., CBS is currently the only major network airing daily national game shows. It still airs  The Price Is Right  and, as of 2009, is also airing a revival of  Lets Make a Deal . Deal airs on weekdays at a time chosen by each CBS affiliate, while Price airs weekdays at 10  am or 11  am in most markets. The oldest, continually aired radio quiz show in the United States was Simply Trivia, which aired on public radio station  |WYSO|Wyso|  in  |Yellow_Springs,_Ohio|Yellow_Springs,_Ohio| . It ran from 1972 through 2014.      Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Family Feud have continued in syndication. To keep pace with the prime-time quiz shows, Jeopardy! doubled its question values in 2001 and lifted its winnings limit in 2003, which one year later allowed  |Ken_Jennings|Ken_Jennings|  to become the shows first multi-million dollar winner; it has also increased the stakes of its tournaments and put a larger focus on contestants with strong personalities. The show has since produced two more millionaires, tournament winner  |Brad_Rutter|Brad_Rutter|  and recent champion  |James_Holzhauer|James_Holzhauer| . Family Feud revived in popularity with a change in tone under host  |Steve_Harvey|Steve_Harvey|  to include more  |suggestive_humor|Blue_Comedy| .     In 2009, actress and comedienne  |Kim_Coles|Kim_Coles|  became the first black woman to host a prime time game show, Pay It Off.     The rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs.  |Buzzr|Buzzr|  was established by  |FremantleMedia_North_America|Fremantlemedia_North_America| , owners of numerous classic U.S. game shows, as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June 2015. There has also been a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues, where the general audience can participate in the show, such as the science-inspired Geek Out Game Show or the Yuck Show.     During the latter half of the 2000s and the first half of the 2010s, several game shows were conducted in a tournament format; examples included  Duel ,  The Million Second Quiz ,  500 Questions ,  The American Bible Challenge , and  Mental Samurai .     A boom in  |prime_time|Prime_Time|  revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid-2010s. In 2016, ABC packaged the existing  Celebrity Family Feud , which had returned in 2015, with new versions of  To Tell the Truth ,  The $100,000 Pyramid , and  Match Game  in 2016.  |TBS|Tbs| , in turn, launched a  |marijuana|Cannabis| -themed revival of  The Jokers Wild , hosted by  |Snoop_Dogg|Snoop_Dogg| , in October 2017. This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time, including  Deal or No Deal ,  Child Support ,  Hollywood Game Night ,  1 vs. 100 , and  The Wall , and a string of music-themed games such as  Dont Forget the Lyrics! ,  The Singing Bee , and  Beat Shazam .         The popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world.  |Reg_Grundy_Organisation|Reg_Grundy_Organisation| , for instance, would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries, especially in Grundys native  |Australia|Australia| . Most game show formats that are popular in one country are  |franchised|Media_Franchise|  to others.     Game shows have had an inconsistent place in  |Canadian_television|Television_In_Canada| , with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French-speaking  |Quebec|Quebec| ois market and the majority of English-language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from, or made with the express intent of export to, the United States. There have been exceptions to this . Unlike  |reality_television|Reality_Television|  franchises, international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials, based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for  |Canadian_content|Canadian_Content|  credits . The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there, with Canadian games often having very low budgets for prizes, unless the series is made for export. Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows, and there have been at least two Canadian game show hosts –  |Monty_Hall|Monty_Hall|  and  |Alex_Trebek|Alex_Trebek|  – who have gone on to long careers hosting American series, while  |Jim_Perry|Jim_Perry| , an American host, was prominent as a host of Canadian shows.     American game shows have a tendency to hire stronger contestants than their British or Australian counterparts. Many of the most successful game show contestants in America would likely never be cast in a British or Australian game show for fear of having them dominate the game, according to  |Mark_Labbett|Mark_Labbett| , who appeared in all three countries on the game show  The Chase .        Many of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through  |product_placement|Product_Placement| , but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show. There is the widespread use of promotional consideration , in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturers product as a prize or  |consolation_prize|Consolation_Prize| . Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded at all and are instead just used as part of the gameplay .     For high-stakes games, a network may purchase  |prize_indemnity_insurance|Prize_Indemnity_Insurance|  to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket. If the said prize is won too often, the insurance company may refuse to insure a show; this was a factor in the discontinuation of  The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular  series of prime-time specials. In April 2008, three of the contestants on The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular won the top prize in a five-episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner, due in large part to a change in the rules. The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes. A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an  |annuity|Annuity| , spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades.     From about 1960 through the rest of the 20th century, American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the 1950s. This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes, usually five, on which a player could appear on a show. The introduction of  |syndicated|Broadcast_Syndication|  games, particularly in the 1980s, eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show. British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 1990s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game.  In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 1990s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.       A bonus round usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher. Graham, Jefferson, Come on Down!!! The TV Game Show Book, Abbeville Press Publishers, New York, 1988.     The game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as bonus rounds , many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role.     There is no one formula for the format of a bonus round. There are differences in almost every bonus round, though there are many recurring elements from show to show. The bonus round is often played for the shows top prize.     Until the 1960s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner – if a game shows rules provided for this – became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.     One of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series  Beat the Clock . After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 20 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $200 if she was unsuccessful.     Another early bonus round ended each episode of  You Bet Your Life  with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.     Another early example was the Lightning Round on the word game  Password , starting in 1961. The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 60 seconds, netting $50 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $250. Schwartz, David, Steve Ryan and Fred Westbock. The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows: 3rd Edition , Checkmark Books, Facts on File Inc., 1999, pg. xviii.      The bonus round came about after game show producer  |Mark_Goodson|Mark_Goodson|  was first presented Password, contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show. We needed something more, and thats how the Lightning Round was invited, said  |Howard_Felsher|Howard_Felsher| , who produced Password and  Family Feud . From that point on every game show had to have an end round. Youd bring a show to a network and theyd say, Whats the endgame? as if they had thought of it themselves. Graham, p. 54.     The end game of  Match Game , hosted for most of its run by  |Gene_Rayburn|Gene_Rayburn| , served as the impetus for a completely new game show. The first part of Match Games Super-Match bonus round, called the Audience Match , asked contestants to guess how a studio audience responded to a question. In 1975, with then regular panelist  |Richard_Dawson|Richard_Dawson|  becoming restless and progressively less cooperative, Goodson decided that this line of questioning would make a good game show of its own, and the concept eventually became  Family Feud .
