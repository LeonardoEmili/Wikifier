Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.     The upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet , how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources . No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxos version. However, elements of Belleforests version which are not in Saxos story do appear in Shakespeares play.

Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering an authentic Hamlet an unrealisable ideal. ... there are texts of this play but no text . The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different Hamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis. Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play.

The discovery in 1823 of Q1—whose existence had been quite unsuspected—caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation.

New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that Q1s more linear plot design is certainly easier to follow but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlets shifts in mood.

It is suggested by Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate from issues of poor textual quality. Editing Q1 thus poses problems in whether or not to correct differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her introduction to Q1, wrote that I have avoided as many other alterations as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation. The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881.

Much of Hamlets language is courtly: elaborate, witty discourse, as recommended by Baldassare Castiglione s 1528 etiquette guide, The Courtier. This work specifically advises royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language. Osric and Polonius, especially, seem to respect this injunction. Claudiuss speech is rich with rhetorical figures—as is Hamlets and, at times, Ophelias—while the language of Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers is simpler. Claudiuss high status is reinforced by using the royal first person plural , and anaphora mixed with metaphor to resonate with Greek political speeches.     Of all the characters, Hamlet has the greatest rhetorical skill. He uses highly developed metaphors, stichomythia , and in nine memorable words deploys both anaphora and asyndeton : to die: to sleep—  / To sleep, perchance to dream . Hamlet 3.1.63–64. In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: But I have that within which passes show,  / These but the trappings and the suits of woe . Hamlet 1.2.85–86. At times, he relies heavily on pun s to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them. His nunnery remarks to Ophelia are an example of a cruel double meaning as nunnery was Elizabethan slang for brothel. His very first words in the play are a pun; when Claudius addresses him as my cousin Hamlet, and my son , Hamlet says as an aside: A little more than kin, and less than kind. Hamlet 2.1.63–65.     An unusual rhetorical device, hendiadys , appears in several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelias speech at the end of the nunnery scene: Thexpectancy and rose of the fair state Hamlet 3.1.151. and And I, of ladies most deject and wretched . Hamlet 3.1.154. Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that Hamlet was written later in Shakespeares life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the plays sense of duality and dislocation. Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in Hamlet because he showed how a characters language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings . She gives the example of Hamlets advice to Ophelia, get thee to a nunnery , which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlets confused feelings about female sexuality.

Freud does not offer over-all interpretations of the plays, but uses the two tragedies to illustrate and corroborate his psychological theories, which are based on his treatments of his patients and on his studies. Productions of Hamlet have used Freuds ideas to support their own interpretations. In The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud says that according to his experience parents play a leading part in the infantile psychology of all persons who subsequently become psychoneurotics, and that falling in love with one parent and hating the other is a common impulse in early childhood, and is important source material of subsequent neurosis . He says that in their amorous or hostile attitude toward their parents neurotics reveal something that occurs with less intensity in the minds of the majority of children . Freud considered that Sophocles’ tragedy, Oedipus Rex, with its story that involves crimes of parricide and incest, has furnished us with legendary matter which corroborates these ideas, and that the profound and universal validity of the old legends is understandable only by recognizing the validity of these theories of infantile psychology .     Freud explores the reason Oedipus Rex is capable of moving a modern reader or playgoer no less powerfully than it moved the contemporary Greeks . He suggests that It may be that we were all destined to direct our first sexual impulses toward our mothers, and our first impulses of hatred and violence toward our fathers. Freud suggests that we recoil from the person for whom this primitive wish of our childhood has been fulfilled with all the force of the repression which these wishes have undergone in our minds since childhood.      These ideas, which became a cornerstone of Freuds psychological theories, he named the ": null

But the difference in the psychic life of the two civilizations that produced each play, and the progress made over time of repression in the emotional life of humanity can be seen in the way the same material is handled by the two playwrights: In Oedipus Rex incest and murder are brought into the light as might occur in a dream, but in Hamlet these impulses remain repressed and we learn of their existence though Hamlets inhibitions to act out the revenge, while he is shown to be capable of acting decisively and boldly in other contexts. Freud asserts, The play is based on Hamlet’s hesitation in accomplishing the task of revenge assigned to him; the text does not give the cause or the motive of this. The conflict is deeply hidden .     Hamlet is able to perform any kind of action except take revenge on the man who murdered his father and has taken his fathers place with his mother—Claudius has led Hamlet to realize the repressed desires of his own childhood. The loathing which was supposed to drive him to revenge is replaced by self-reproach, by conscientious scruples which tell him he himself is no better than the murderer whom he is required to punish . Freud suggests that Hamlets sexual aversion expressed in his nunnery conversation with Ophelia supports the idea that Hamlet is an hysterical subject .     Freud suggests that the character Hamlet goes through an experience that has three characteristics, which he numbered: 1": null
