     Administrative law is the body of  |law|Law|  that governs the activities of  |administrative_agencies|Government_Agency|  of  |government|Forms_Of_Government| . Government agency action can include  |rule_making|Rule_Making| ,  |adjudication|Adjudication| , or the  |enforcement|Enforcement|  of a specific  |regulatory|Regulation|  agenda. Administrative law is considered a branch of  |public_law|Public_Law| .     Administrative law deals with the decision-making of such administrative units of government as  |tribunals|Tribunal| ,  |boards|Board_Of_Directors|  or  |commissions|Government_Agency|  that are part of a national  |regulatory_scheme|Regulation|  in such areas as  |police_law|Police_Law| ,  |international_trade|International_Trade| ,  |manufacturing|Manufacturing| , the  |environment|Environment| ,  |taxation|Taxation| ,  |broadcasting|Broadcasting| ,  |immigration|Immigration|  and  |transport|Transport| .     Administrative law expanded greatly during the twentieth century, as legislative bodies worldwide created more government agencies to regulate the social, economic and political spheres of human interaction.     Civil law countries often have specialized  |administrative_courts|Administrative_Court|  that review these decisions.               Unlike most common-law jurisdictions, the majority of  |civil_law|Civil_Law|  jurisdictions have specialized courts or sections to deal with administrative cases which, as a rule, will apply procedural rules specifically designed for such cases and distinct from those applied in private-law proceedings, such as  |contract|Contract|  or  |tort|Tort|  claims.       In  |Brazil|Brazil| , administrative cases are typically heard either by the Federal Courts or by the Public Treasury divisions of State Courts . In 1998, a constitutional reform, led by the government of President  |Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso|Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso| , introduced regulatory agencies as a part of the executive branch. Since 1988, Brazilian administrative law has been strongly influenced by the judicial interpretations of the constitutional principles of public administration : legality, impersonality, publicity of administrative acts, morality and efficiency.            In  |Chile|Chile|  the  |President_of_the_Republic|President_Of_Chile|  exercises the administrative function, in collaboration with several Ministries or other authorities with ministerial rank. Each Ministry has one or more under-secretary that performs through  |public_services|Public_Services|  the actual satisfaction of public needs. There is not a single  |specialized_court|Administrative_Court|  to deal with actions against the Administrative entities, but instead there are several specialized courts and procedures of review.            In  |France|France| , most claims against the national or local governments as well as claims against private bodies providing public services    and  are handled by  |administrative_courts|Administrative_Court| , which use the  Conseil dÉtat  as a court of last resort for both ordinary and special courts.    and  The main administrative courts are the tribunaux administratifs and appeal courts are the cours administratives dappel. Special administrative courts include the  |National_Court_of_Asylum_Right|Cour_Nationale_Du_Droit_Dasile|  as well as military, medical and judicial disciplinary bodies. The French body of administrative law is called droit administratif .      Over the course of their history, Frances administrative courts have developed an extensive and coherent  |case_law|Jurisprudence_Constante|   and  |legal_doctrine|Legal_Doctrine|  , often before similar concepts were enshrined in constitutional and legal texts. These principes include:      |Right_to_fair_trial|Right_To_Fair_Trial|  ,    and CE, Ass, 26 octobre 1945, Aramu including for internal disciplinary bodies   Right to challenge any administrative decision before an administrative court       Equal treatment of  |public_service|Public_Service|  users       Equal access to government employment  without regard for political opinions       |Freedom_of_association|Freedom_Of_Association|      Right to Entrepreneurship     Right to  |Legal_certainty|Legal_Certainty|        French administrative law, which is the founder of Continental administrative law, has a strong influence on administrative laws in several other countries such as Belgium, Greece, Turkey and Tunisia.            In Germany administrative law is called Verwaltungsrecht  |:de:Verwaltungsrecht|:De:Verwaltungsrecht| , which generally rules the relationship between authorities and the citizens. It establishes citizens rights and obligations against the   authorities. It is a part of the public law, which deals with the organization, the tasks and the acting of the public administration. It also contains rules, regulations, orders and decisions created by and related to administrative agencies, such as federal agencies, federal state authorities, urban administrations, but also admission offices and fiscal authorities etc. Administrative law in Germany follows three basic principles.     Principle of the legality of the authority, which means that there is no acting against the law and no acting without a law.   Principle of legal security, which includes a principle of legal certainty and the principle of nonretroactivity   Principle of proportionality, which says that an act of an authority has to be suitable, necessary and appropriate Oberath, öffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht pp. 12–14     Administrative law in Germany can be divided into general administrative law and special administrative law.       The general administration law is basically ruled in the administrative procedures law . Other legal sources are the Rules of the Administrative Courts , the social security code and the general fiscal law . Oberath, öffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht p. 148     Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz , which was enacted in 1977, Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar No. 1 and 26 regulates the main administrative procedures of the federal government. It serves the purpose to ensure a treatment in accordance with the rule of law by the public authority. Furthermore, it contains the regulations for mass processes and expands the legal protection against the authorities. The VwVfG basically applies for the entire public administrative activities of federal agencies as well as federal state authorities, in case of making federal law. One of the central clause is § 35 VwVfG. It defines the administrative act, the most common form of action in which the public administration occurs against a citizen. The definition in § 35  says, that an administration act is characterized by the following features:     It is an official act Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No.59 of an authority Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No.65 in the field of public law Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No.70 to resolve an individual case Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No. 118 with effect to the outside. Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar §35 No. 124     §§ 36 – 39, §§ 58 – 59 and § 80 VwV––fG rule the structure and the necessary elements of the   administrative act. § 48 and § 49 VwVfG have a high relevance in practice, as well. In these   paragraphs, the prerequisites for redemption of an unlawful administration act  and   withdrawal of a lawful administration act , are listed. Oberath, öffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht 161–163      |Bundesverwaltungsgericht|Bundesverwaltungsgericht| . There are federal courts with special jurisdiction in the fields of social security law  and tax law .            In  |Italy|Italy|  administrative law is known as Diritto amministrativo , a branch of  |public_law|Public_Law|  whose rules govern the organization of the  |public_administration|Public_Administration|  and the activities of the pursuit of the public interest of the  |public_administration|Public_Administration|  and the relationship between this and the citizens.   Its genesis is related to the principle of division of powers of the State. The administrative power, originally called executive , is to organize resources and people whose function is devolved to achieve the public interest objectives as defined by the law.        In the  |Netherlands|Netherlands|  administrative law provisions are usually contained in separate laws. There is however a single General Administrative Law Act that applies both to the making of administrative decisions and the judicial review of these decisions in courts. On the basis of the Awb, citizens can oppose a decision made by an administrative agency within the administration and apply for judicial review in courts if unsuccessful.     Unlike France or Germany, there are no special administrative courts of first instance in the Netherlands, but regular courts have an administrative chamber which specializes in administrative appeals. The courts of appeal in administrative cases however are specialized depending on the case, but most administrative appeals end up in the judicial section of the Council of State .     Before going to court, citizens must usually first object to the decision with the administrative body who made it. This is called bezwaar . This procedure allows for the administrative body to correct possible mistakes themselves and is used to filter cases before going to court. Sometimes, instead of bezwaar, a different system is used called administratief beroep . The difference with bezwaar is that administratief beroep is filed with a different administrative body, usually a higher ranking one, than the administrative body that made the primary decision. Administratief beroep is available only if the law on which the primary decision is based specifically provides for it. An example involves objecting to a  |traffic_ticket|Traffic_Ticket|  with the district attorney , after which the decision can be appealed in court.     In addition, Netherlands General Administrative Law Act is a rather good sample of procedural laws in Europe            Administrative law in the  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Peoples_Republic_Of_China|  was virtually non-existent before the  |economic_reform_era|History_Of_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China_Reform_And_Opening_Up|  initiated by Deng Xiaoping. Since the 1980s, the Peoples Republic of China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law, establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However, many have argued that the usefulness of these laws is vastly inadequate in terms of controlling government actions, largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary, poorly trained judges and lawyers, and corruption.     In 1990, the Administrative Supervision Regulations and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations were passed. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations changed the way government officials were selected and promoted, requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals, and introduced a rotation system. The three regulations have been amended and upgraded into laws. In 1994, the State Compensation Law was passed, followed by the Administrative Penalties Law in 1996. Administrative Compulsory Law was enforced in 2012. Administrative Litigation Law was amended in 2014. The General Administrative Procedure Law is under way.            In the  |Republic_of_China|Republic_Of_China|  the recently enacted Constitutional Procedure Act in 2019 , the Justices of the Constitutional Court of  |Judicial_Yuan|Judicial_Yuan|  of Taiwan is in charge of  |judicial_interpretation|Judicial_Interpretation| . This council has made 757 interpretations to date Interpretations of the Constitutional Court of ROC. Available at  .            In  |Sweden|Sweden| , there is a system of administrative courts that considers only administrative law cases, and is completely separate from the system of general courts.  , accessed on February 20, 2009 This system has three tiers, with 12 county administrative courts  as the first tier, four administrative courts of appeal  as the second tier, and the  |Supreme_Administrative_Court_of_Sweden|Supreme_Administrative_Court_Of_Sweden|   as the third tier.     Migration cases are handled in a two-tier system, effectively within the system general administrative courts. Three of the administrative courts serve as migration courts  with the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm serving as the Migration Court of Appeal .       In  |Turkey|Turkey| , the lawsuits against the acts and actions of the national or local governments and public bodies are handled by administrative courts which are the main administrative courts. The decisions of the administrative courts are checked by the Regional Administrative Courts and Council of State. Council of State as a court of last resort is exactly similar to  |Conseil_dÉtat|Conseil_Détat|  in France. Yucel Ogurlu, Canan Kucukali, Focus on ICT in Turkish Judicial System, , p.50. Administrative Sanctioning System in Turkey, www.idare.gen.tr/ogurlu-administrative.htm            Administrative law in the  |Ukraine|Ukraine|  is a homogeneous legal substance isolated in a system of jurisprudence characterized as: a branch of law; a science; a discipline.        Generally speaking, most countries that follow the principles of  |common_law|Common_Law|  have developed procedures for  |judicial_review|Judicial_Review|  that limit the reviewability of decisions made by administrative law bodies. Often these procedures are coupled with legislation or other common law doctrines that establish standards for proper  |rulemaking|Rulemaking| . Administrative law may also apply to review of decisions of so-called semi-public bodies, such as  |non-profit_corporations|Non-Profit_Corporations| , disciplinary boards, and other decision-making bodies that affect the legal rights of members of a particular group or entity.     While administrative decision-making bodies are often controlled by larger governmental units, their decisions could be reviewed by a  |court|Court|  of  |general_jurisdiction|General_Jurisdiction|  under some principle of judicial review based upon  |due_process|Due_Process|  or  |fundamental_justice|Fundamental_Justice|  . Judicial review of administrative decisions is different from an administrative appeal. When sitting in review of a decision, the Court will only look at the method in which the decision was arrived at, whereas in an administrative appeal the correctness of the decision itself will be examined, usually by a higher body in the agency. This difference is vital in appreciating administrative law in common law countries.     The scope of judicial review may be limited to certain questions of  |fairness|Equity| , or whether the administrative action is  ultra vires . In terms of ultra vires actions in the broad sense, a reviewing court may set aside an administrative decision if it is  |unreasonable|Unreasonable|  ,  |Wednesbury_unreasonable|Wednesbury_Unreasonableness|  , or arbitrary and capricious . Administrative law, as laid down by the  |Supreme_Court_of_India|Supreme_Court_Of_India| , has also recognized two more grounds of judicial review which were recognized but not applied by English Courts, namely  |legitimate_expectation|Legitimate_Expectation|  and  |proportionality|Proportionality| .     The powers to review administrative decisions are usually established by statute, but were originally developed from the royal  |prerogative_writs|Prerogative_Writ|  of  |English_law|English_Law| , such as the writ of  |mandamus|Mandamus|  and the writ of  |certiorari|Certiorari| . In certain common law jurisdictions, such as  |India|India|  or  |Pakistan|Pakistan| , the power to pass such writs is a Constitutionally guaranteed power. This power is seen as fundamental to the power of judicial review and an aspect of the independent  |judiciary|Judiciary| .                                                In the United States, many  |government_agencies|Government_Agency|  are organized under the  |executive_branch|Executive|  of government, although a few are part of the  |judicial|Judiciary|  or  |legislative_branches|Legislature| .     In the  |federal_government|Federal_Government_Of_The_United_States| , the executive branch, led by the  |president|President_Of_The_United_States| , controls the  |federal_executive_departments|United_States_Federal_Executive_Departments| , which are led by secretaries who are members of the  |United_States_Cabinet|United_States_Cabinet| . The many  |independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government|Independent_Agencies_Of_The_United_States_Government|  created by  |statutes|Statutes|  enacted by  |Congress|United_States_Congress|  exist outside of the federal executive departments but are still part of the executive branch.     Congress has also created some special judicial bodies known as  |Article_I_tribunals|Article_I_And_Article_Iii_Tribunals|  to handle some areas of administrative law.     The actions of executive agencies and independent agencies are the main focus of American administrative law. In response to the rapid creation of new independent agencies in the early twentieth century ,  |Congress|U.S._Congress|  enacted the  |Administrative_Procedure_Act|Administrative_Procedure_Act|   in 1946. Many of the independent agencies operate as miniature versions of the tripartite federal government, with the authority to legislate ,  |adjudicate|Adjudication|  , and to execute administrative goals . Because the  |United_States_Constitution|United_States_Constitution|  sets no limits on this tripartite authority of  |administrative_agencies|Government_Agency| , Congress enacted the  |APA|Administrative_Procedure_Act|  to establish fair administrative law procedures to comply with the constitutional requirements of  |due_process|Due_Process| . Agency procedures are drawn from four sources of authority: the APA, organic statutes, agency rules, and informal agency practice. It is important to note, though, that agencies can only act within their congressionally delegated authority, New York v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 535 U.S. 1, 18 . and must comply with the requirements of the APA.     At state level the first version of the Model State Administrative Procedure Act was promulgated and published in 1946 by the Uniform Law Commission , in which year the Federal Administrative Procedure Act was drafted. It is incorporated basic principles with only enough elaboration of detail to support essential features, therefore it is a “model”, and not a “uniform”, act. A model act is needed because state administrative law in the states is not uniform, and there are a variety of approaches used in the various states. Later it was modified in 1961 and 1981. The present version is the 2010 Model State Administrative Procedure Act  which maintains the continuity with earlier ones. The reason of the revision is that, in the past two decades state legislatures, dissatisfied with agency rule-making and adjudication, have enacted statutes that modify administrative adjudication and rule-making procedure.      The  |American_Bar_Associations|American_Bar_Association|  official journal concerning administrative law is the  Administrative Law Review , a quarterly publication that is managed and edited by students at the  |Washington_College_of_Law|Washington_College_Of_Law| .        |Stephen_Breyer|Stephen_Breyer| , a  |U.S._Supreme_Court_Justice|U.S._Supreme_Court_Justice|  since 1994, divides the history of administrative law in the United States into six discrete periods, in his book, Administrative Law & Regulatory Policy :     English antecedents & the American experience to 1875   1875 – 1930: the rise of regulation & the traditional model of administrative law   1930 - 1945: the New Deal   1945 – 1965: the  |Administrative_Procedure_Act|Administrative_Procedure_Act|  & the maturation of the traditional model of administrative law   1965 – 1985: critique and transformation of the administrative process   1985 – ?: retreat or consolidation       The agricultural sector is one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the U.S. economy, as it is regulated in various ways at the international, federal, state, and local levels. Consequently, administrative law is a significant component of the discipline of  |agricultural_law|Agricultural_Law| . The  |United_States_Department_of_Agriculture|United_States_Department_Of_Agriculture|  and its myriad agencies such as the  are the primary sources of regulatory activity, although other administrative bodies such as the  |Environmental_Protection_Agency|United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency| .
