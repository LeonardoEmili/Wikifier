     An afterglow is a broad arch of whitish or pinkish  |sunlight|Sunlight|  in the  |sky|Sky|  that is  |scattered|Light_Scattering|  by fine  |particulates|Particulates|  like  |dust|Dust|  suspended in the  |atmosphere|Earths_Atmosphere| . An afterglow may appear above the highest  |clouds|Cloud|  in the hour of fading  |twilight|Twilight| , or be  |reflected|Reflection|  off high  |snow|Snow| fields in  |mountain|Mountain|  regions long after  |sunset|Sunset| . The particles produce a  |scattering|Scattering|  effect upon the component parts of  |white_light|Electromagnetic_Spectrumvisible_Radiation_28Light_29| .     True  |alpenglow|Alpenglow| , which occurs long after sunset or long before sunrise, is caused by the  |backscatter|Backscatter| ing of red sunlight by  |aerosols|Aerosols|  and fine dust particles low in the atmosphere. After sunset, alpenglow is an afterglow caused by the illumination of atmospheric particles by sunlight as it gets  |refracted|Refraction|  and  |scattered|Rayleigh_Scattering|  through the Earths atmosphere.     The  |high_energy|Energy_Of_Light|  and  |high_frequency|High_Frequency|  light is  |scattered|Scattering_Of_Electromagnetic_Radiation|  out the most, while the remaining low-energy and -frequency light reaches the observer on the  |horizon|Horizon|  at  |twilight|Twilight| . The backscattering of this light further turns it pinkish to reddish. This period of time is referred to as  |blue_hour|Blue_Hour|  and is widely treasured by  |photographers|Photographers|  and  |painters|Painters| .     The afterglow persists until the  |Earths_shadow|Earths_Shadow|   overtakes the sky above the observer as night falls and the stars appear, with  |Venus|Venus|   visible above the horizon opposite of the  |Belt_of_Venus|Belt_Of_Venus|  around the  |antisolar_point|Antisolar_Point| .     After the  |1883_eruption|1883_Eruption_Of_Krakatoa|  of the  |volcano|Volcano| |_Krakatoa|Krakatoa| , a remarkable series of red  |sunsets|Sunset|  appeared worldwide. An enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust were blown to a great height by the volcanos explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric winds.  |Edvard_Munchs|Edvard_Munch|  painting  The Scream  possibly depicts an afterglow during this period.
