     The  |Western_Pacific|Pacific_Ocean|  nation of  |Tuvalu|Tuvalu| , formerly known as the Ellice Islands. It is situated  northeast of  |Australia|Australia|  and is approximately halfway between  |Hawaii|Hawaii|  and Australia. It lies east-northeast of the  |Santa_Cruz_Islands|Santa_Cruz_Islands|  , southeast of  |Nauru|Nauru| , south of  |Kiribati|Kiribati| , west of  |Tokelau|Tokelau| , northwest of  |Samoa|Samoa|  and  |Wallis_and_Futuna|Wallis_And_Futuna|  and north of  |Fiji|Fiji| . It is a very small  |island_country|Island_Country|  of and is . Due to the spread out islands it has the 38th largest  |Exclusive_Economic_Zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone|  of .     Tuvalu consists of three  |reef|Reef|  islands and six  |atolls|Atolls| . The reef islands have a different structure to the atolls, and are described as reef platforms as they are smaller tabular reef platforms that do not have a salt-water  |lagoon|Lagoon| ,  although they have a completely closed rim of dry land, with the remnants of a lagoon that has no connection to the open sea or that may be drying up.  For example,  |Niutao|Niutao|  has two lakes, which are brackish to saline; and are the degraded lagoon as the result of coral debris filling the lagoon.     The  |islands_of_Tuvalu|List_Of_Islands_Of_Tuvalu|  have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26  km², less than . The land is very low-lying, with narrow coral atolls. The highest elevation is  above sea level on  |Niulakita|Niulakita| . Over 4 decades, there had been a net increase in land area of the islets of 73.5 ha , although the changes are not uniform, with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. The sea level at the Funafuti tide gauge has risen at 3.9  mm per year, which is approximately twice the global average.  The rising sea levels are identified as creating an increased transfer of wave energy across reef surfaces, which shifts sand, resulting in accretion to island shorelines,  although this process does not result in additional habitable land.  but as of March 2018  |Enele_Sopoaga|Enele_Sopoaga| , the prime minister of Tuvalu, stated that Tuvalu is not expanding and has gained no additional habitable land.      Tuvalu experiences two distinct seasons, a wet season from November to April and a dry season from May to October.  Westerly gales and heavy rain are the predominate weather conditions from October to March, the period that is known as Tau-o-lalo, with tropical temperatures moderated by easterly winds from April to November. In terms of size, it is the second-smallest country in Oceania. Rodgers, K. A., and Carol Cantrell. The biology and geology of Tuvalu: an annotated bibliography. No. 1.

On 29 August 2012 an Agreement between Tuvalu and Kiribati concerning their Maritime Boundary, was signed by their respective leaders that determined the boundary as being seaward of  |Nanumea|Nanumea|  and  |Niutao|Niutao|  in Tuvalu on the one hand and  |Tabiteuea|Tabiteuea| ,  |Tamana|Tamana,_Kiribati|  and  |Arorae|Arorae|  in  |Kiribati|Kiribati|  on the other hand, along the  |geodesics|Geodesics|  connecting the points of latitude and longitude set out in the agreement.      In October 2014 the prime ministers of Fiji and Tuvalu signed the Fiji-Tuvalu Maritime Boundary Treaty, which establishes the extent of the national areas of jurisdiction between Fiji and Tuvalu as recognized in international law under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

The islets of the  |Funafuti_Conservation_Area|Funafuti_Conservation_Area|  have 40% of the remaining native broadleaf forest on  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  atoll. While  |Coconut|Coconut|  palms are common in Tuvalu, they are usually cultivated rather than naturally seeding and growing. Tuvaluan traditional histories are that the first settlers of the islands planted  |Coconut|Coconut|  palms as they were not found on the islands. The native broadleaf forest of Funafuti would include the following species, that were described by  |Charles_Hedley|Charles_Hedley|  in 1896,  which include the Tuvaluan name Fala or Screw Pine,    Puka or pouka,    Futu,    Fetau,    Ferra, , native fig   Fau or Fo fafini, or womans fibre tree    Lakoumonong,    Lou,    Meili, , fern   birds-nest fern,  Asplenium nidus  Milo or miro,    Ngashu or Naupaka,    Ngia or Ingia, , bush   Nonou or nonu,    Pukavai,    Sageta, , vine   Talla talla gemoa, , fern   Tausunu or tausoun,    Tonga or tongo, , found around swamps   Tulla tulla, , whose prostrate stems trailed for several feet over the ground   Valla valla,    The blossoms that are valued for their scent and for use in flower necklaces and headdresses include: Fetau, ; Jiali, ; Boua ; and  Crinum .      |Donald_Gilbert_Kennedy|Donald_Gilbert_Kennedy| , the resident District Officer in the administration of the  |Gilbert_and_Ellice_Islands|Gilbert_And_Ellice_Islands|  Colony from 1932 to 1938, identified other trees found in the broadleaf forest:      Pua,    Kanava,      Charles Hedley identified the uses of plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest as including:      Food plants |Coconut|Coconut| ; and Ferra, native fig .

Tuvalu experiences the effects of  |El_Niño|El_Niño|  and  |La_Niña|La_Niña|  that flow from changes in ocean temperatures in equatorial and central Pacific.  |El_Niño|El_Niño|  effects increase the chances of tropical storms and  |cyclones|Cyclones| ; while  |La_Niña|La_Niña|  effects increase the chances of drought conditions in Tuvalu.  On 3 October 2011, drought conditions resulted in a state of emergency being declared as water reserves ran low.    Typically the islands of Tuvalu receive between 200mm to 400mm of rainfall per month, however a weak  |La_Niña|La_Niña|  effect causes a drought by cooling the surface of the sea around Tuvalu.            Severe  |tropical_cyclones|Tropical_Cyclone|  are usually rare, however the low level of islands makes them very sensitive to sea-level rise. Tuvalu experienced an average of three cyclones per decade between the 1940s and 1970s, however eight occurred in the 1980s.  The impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and also whether a cyclone coincides with high tides. A warning system, which uses the  |Iridium|Iridium_Satellite_Constellation|  satellite network, was introduced in 2016 in order to allow outlying islands to be better prepare for natural disasters.      George Westbrook recorded a cyclone that struck  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  on 23–24 December 1883.   A cyclone struck Nukulaelae on 17–18 March 1886. Captain Davis of HMS Royalist, who visited the Ellice Group in 1892, recorded in the ships diary that in February 1891 the Ellice Group was devastated by a severe cyclone.  A cyclone caused severe damage to the islands in 1894.          |Cyclone_Bebe|Cyclone_Bebe|  caused severe damage to  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  during the  |1972–73_South_Pacific_cyclone_season|1972–73_South_Pacific_Cyclone_Season| . Funafutis  |Tepuka_Vili_Vili|Pukasavilivili| |islet|Islet|  was devastated by  |Cyclone_Meli|1975–80_Southern_Hemisphere_Tropical_Cyclone_Seasonscyclone_Meli|  in 1979, with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone.   |Cyclone_Gavin|Cyclone_Gavin|  was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season with Cyclones  |Hina|Cyclone_Hina|  and  |Keli|Cyclone_Keli|  following later in the season.  |Cyclone_Ofa|Cyclone_Ofa|  had a major impact on Tuvalu in late January and early February 1990.    On  |Vaitupu|Vaitupu|  Island around 85 percent of residential homes, trees and food crops were destroyed, while residential homes were also destroyed on the islands of  |Niutao|Niutao| ,  |Nui|Nui|  and  |Nukulaelae|Nukulaelae| . The majority of the islands in Tuvalu reported damage to vegetation and crops especially bananas, coconuts and breadfruit, with the extent of damage ranging from 10 to 40 percent. In  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  sea waves flattened the Hurricane Bebe bank at the southern end of the airstrip, which caused sea flooding and prompted the evacuation of several families from their homes. In Nui and Niulakita there was a minor loss of the landscape because of sea flooding while there were no lives lost. Soon after the systems had impacted Tuvalu, a Disaster Rehabilitation Sub-Committee was appointed to evaluate the damage caused and make recommendations to the National Disaster Committee and to the Cabinet of Tuvalu, on what should be done to help rehabilitate the affected areas.     In March 2015  |Cyclone_Pam|Cyclone_Pam| , the Category 5 cyclone that devastated  |Vanuatu|Vanuatu| , caused damage to houses, crops and infrastructure on the outer islands.     A state of emergency was subsequently declared on 13 March.   An estimated 45  percent of the nations nearly 10,000  people were displaced, according to  |Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Tuvalu| |Enele_Sopoaga|Enele_Sopoaga| .   The three northern islands,  |Nanumea|Nanumea| ,  |Nanumanga|Nanumanga|  and  |Niutao|Niutao|  were badly affected by flooding as the result of storm surges. More than 400 people from the northern island of Nanumanga were moved to emergency accommodation in the school buildings, as well as another 85 families from  |Nukulaelae|Nukulaelae|  in the south of Tuvalu. On  |Nui|Nui|  the storm surges contaminated the water supplies and damaged septic tanks and grave sites. The central islands of  |Vaitupu|Vaitupu|  and  |Nukufetau|Nukufetau|  were also affected by flooding caused by storm surges.    The Situation Report published on 30 March reported that on Nukufetau all the displaced people have returned to their homes.      Nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands ;  with both Nui and Nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops. Of the three northern islands , Nanumanga suffered the most damage, with 60–100 houses flooded and damage to the health facility.   |Vasafua|Vasafua|  islet, part of the  |Funafuti_Conservation_Area|Funafuti_Conservation_Area| , was severely damaged by Cyclone Pam. The coconut palms were washed away, leaving the islet as a sand bar.          |Nui|Nui|  was struck by a giant wave on 16 February 1882;  earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occurring in the basin of the  |Pacific_Ocean|Pacific_Ocean|  and along the Pacific  |Ring_of_Fire|Ring_Of_Fire|  are a possible cause of a  |tsunami|Tsunami| . There is  |earthquake_activity_in_the_Solomon_Islands|2007_Solomon_Islands_Earthquaketectonic_Summary| , where earthquakes occurred along the boundary of the  |Pacific_Plate|Pacific_Plate|  with, respectively, the  |Indo-Australia|Indo-Australian_Plate| ,  |Woodlark|Woodlark_Plate| , and Solomon Sea plates.                 Tuvalu consists of three  |reef|Reef|  islands and six true  |atolls|Atolls| . Its small, scattered group of  |atolls|Atolls|  have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26  square kilometres making it the fourth smallest country in the world. The islets that form the atolls are very low-lying.  |Nanumaga|Nanumaga| ,  |Niutao|Niutao| ,  |Niulakita|Niulakita|  are  |reef|Reef|  islands and the six true atolls are  |Funafuti|Funafuti| ,  |Nanumea|Nanumea| ,  |Nui|Nui| ,  |Nukufetau|Nukufetau| ,  |Nukulaelae|Nukulaelae|  and  |Vaitupu|Vaitupu| .  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  is the largest  |atoll|Atoll|  of the nine low  |reef|Reef|  islands and atolls that form the Tuvalu volcanic island chain. It comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25.1 kilometres by 18.4 kilometres , centred on 179°7’E and 8°30’S. On the atolls an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon, with several natural reef channels.  A standard definition of an atoll is an annular reef enclosing a lagoon in which there are no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus . The northern part of the Funafuti lagoon has a deep basin basin, and the southern part of the lagoon has very narrow shallow basin.      The eastern shoreline of  |Fongafale|Fongafale|  in the Funafuti lagoon  was modified during World War II; several piers were constructed, beach areas filled, and deep water access channels were excavated. These alternations to the reef and shoreline have resulted in changes to wave patterns with less sand accumulating to form the beaches as compared to former times; and the shoreline is now exposed to wave action.  Several attempts to stabilize the shoreline have not achieved the desired effect.      The rising population results in increased demand on fish stocks, which are under stress; although the creation of the  |Funafuti_Conservation_Area|Funafuti_Conservation_Area|  has provided a fishing exclusion area that helps sustain fish populations across the Funafuti lagoon. Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti and in-adequation sanitation systems have resulted in pollution.  The Waste Operations and Services Act 2009 provides the legal framework for the waste management and pollution control projects funded by the European Union that are directed to organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems.   |Plastic_waste|Plastic_Pollution|  is also a problem as much imported food and other commodities is supplied in plastic containers or packaging.     Surveys were carried out in May 2010 of the reef habitats of Nanumea, Nukulaelae and Funafuti and a total of 317 fish species were recorded during this Tuvalu Marine Life study. The surveys identified 66 species that had not previously been recorded in Tuvalu, which brings the total number of identified species to 607.            Since there are no streams or rivers and groundwater is not potable, most water needs must be met by catchment systems with storage facilities; beachhead erosion because of the use of sand for building materials; excessive clearance of forest undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from the bleaching of the coral as a consequence of the increase of the ocean temperatures and acidification from increased levels of carbon dioxide; Tuvalu is very concerned about global increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on rising sea levels, which threaten the countrys underground water table. Tuvalu has adopted a national plan of action as the observable transformations over the last ten to fifteen years show Tuvaluans that there have been changes to the sea levels.      Because of the low elevation, the islands that make up this nation are threatened by current and future  |sea_level_rise|Sea_Level_Rise| .   The highest elevation is  above sea level on  |Niulakita|Niulakita| ,  which gives Tuvalu the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country . However, the highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to over topping in tropical cyclones, such as occurred on  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  with  |Cyclone_Bebe|Cyclone_Bebe| .           Tuvalu is mainly composed of coral debris eroded from encircling reefs and pushed up onto the islands by winds and waves.  Paul Kench at the  |University_of_Auckland|University_Of_Auckland|  in New Zealand and Arthur Webb at the  |South_Pacific_Applied_Geoscience_Commission|South_Pacific_Applied_Geoscience_Commission|  in  |Fiji|Fiji|  released a study in 2010 on the dynamic response of reef islands to sea level rise in the central Pacific. Tuvalu was mentioned in the study, and Webb and Kench found that seven islands in one of its nine atolls have spread by more than 3 per cent on average since the 1950s.  One island,  |Funamanu|Funamanu| , gained 0.44 hectares, or nearly 30 per cent of its previous area. In contrast,  |Tepuka_Vili_Vili|Tepuka_Vili_Vili|  has suffered a net loss in area of 22 percent since 1896. The shape and orientation of the reef has also changed over time.     Further research by Kench et al., published in 2018 identifies rising sea levels as creating an increased transfer of wave energy across the reef surfaces of the atolls of Tuvalu, which shifts sand, resulting in accretion to island shorelines. Over 4 decades, there had been a net increase in land area of the islets of 73.5 ha , although the changes are not uniform, with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. However, this process does not result in additional habitable land.     The storm surge resulting from a  |tropical_cyclone|Tropical_Cyclone|  can dramatically shift coral debris. In 1972 Funafuti was in the path of  |Cyclone_Bebe|Cyclone_Bebe| . Tropical Cyclone Bebe was a pre-season  |tropical_cyclone|Tropical_Cyclone|  that impacted the  |Gilbert|Gilbert_Islands| ,  |Ellice_Islands|Tuvalu| , and  |Fiji|Fiji|  island groups. Bureau of Meteorology Tropical Cyclones in the Northern Australian Regions 1971–1972 Australian Government Publishing Service The storm surge created a wall of coral rubble along the ocean side of  |Fongafale|Fongafale|  and  |Funafala|Funafala|  that was about  long, and about  to  thick at the bottom.  The cyclone knocked down about 90% of the houses and trees on Funafuti and contaminated sources of drinking water as a result of the systems storm surge and fresh water flooding.     Tuvalu is affected by  |perigean_spring_tide|Perigean_Spring_Tide|  events which raise the sea level higher than a normal  |high_tide|High_Tide| .  The highest peak tide recorded by the  |Tuvalu_Meteorological_Service|Tuvalu_Meteorological_Service|  was  on 24 February 2006 and again on 19 February 2015.   As a result of historical sea level rise, the  |king_tide|King_Tide|  events lead to flooding of low-lying areas, which is compounded when sea levels are further raised by  |La_Niña|La_Niña|  effects or local storms and waves. In the future, sea level rise may threaten to submerge the nation entirely as it is estimated that a sea level rise of 20–40  centimetres in the next 100 years could make Tuvalu uninhabitable.  Hunter, J. A. 2002.  . Retrieved 13 May 2006.     Tuvalu experiences westerly gales and heavy rain from October to March – the period that is known as Tau-o-lalo; with tropical temperatures moderated by easterly winds from April to November. Drinking water is mostly obtained from rainwater collected on roofs and stored in tanks; these systems are often poorly maintained, resulting in lack of water.  Aid programs of Australia and the European Union have been directed to improving the storage capacity on Funafuti and in the outer islands.      The reefs at Funafuti have suffered damage, with 80 per cent of the coral having been bleached as a consequence of the increase of the ocean temperatures and acidification from increased levels of carbon dioxide.   The coral bleaching, which includes  |staghorn_corals|Staghorn_Coral| , is attributed to the increase in water temperature that occurred during the  |El_Niños|El_Niño|  that occurred from 1998–2000 and from 2000–2001.  Researchers from Japan have investigated rebuilding the  |coral_reefs|Coral_Reef|  through introduction of  |foraminifera|Foraminifera| .        When the airfield, which is now  |Funafuti_International_Airport|Funafuti_International_Airport| , was constructed during World War II. The coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway. The resulting  |borrow_pits|Borrow_Pit|  impacted the fresh-water  |aquifer|Aquifer| . In the low areas of Funafuti the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide.    Since 1994 a project has been in development to assess the environmental impact of transporting sand from the lagoon to fill all the borrow pits and low-lying areas on  |Fongafale|Fongafale| .  In 2013 a feasibility study was carried out and in 2014 the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation project was approved, so that all ten borrow pits would be filled, leaving Tafua Pond, which is a natural pond.  The New Zealand Government funded the BPR project.  The project was carried out in 2015 with 365,000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island. This project increased the usable land space on Fongafale by eight per cent.

The average depth in the Funafuti lagoon is about 20 fathoms .  With a surface of , it is by far the largest lagoon in Tuvalu. The northern part of the lagoon has a deep basin basin, and the southern part of the lagoon has very narrow shallow basin. The land area of the 33 islets aggregates to , less than one percent of the total area of the atoll.     The boreholes on  |Fongafale|Fongafale|  islet at the site now called Darwins Drill, are the result of drilling conducted by the  |Royal_Society_of_London|Royal_Society_Of_London|  for the purpose of investigating the  |formation_of_coral_reefs|Formation_Of_Coral_Reefs|  to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the  |coral|Coral|  of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on  |The_Structure_and_Distribution_of_Coral_Reefs|The_Structure_And_Distribution_Of_Coral_Reefs|  conducted by  |Charles_Darwin|Charles_Darwin|  in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898.  Professor  |Edgeworth_David|Edgeworth_David|  of the  |University_of_Sydney|University_Of_Sydney|  was a member of the 1896 Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society , under  |Professor_William_Sollas|William_Johnson_Sollas|  and lead the expedition in 1897. David, Mrs Edgeworth, Funafuti or Three Months on a Coral Atoll: an unscientific account of a scientific expedition, London: John Murray, 1899 However, the geologic history of atolls is more complex than Darwin and Davis envisioned.  The survey of the atoll published in 1970 described its structure as being:            The investigation of groundwater dynamics of  |Fongafale|Fongafale|  Islet,  |Funafuti|Funafuti| , show that  |tidal_forcing|Tidal_Force|  results in salt water contamination of the  |surficial_aquifer|Surficial_Aquifer|  during  |spring_tides|Perigean_Spring_Tide| .  The degree of aquifer salinization depends on the specific  |topographic|Topographic|  characteristics and the  |hydrologic|Hydrologic|  controls in the sub-surface of the atoll. About half of Fongafale islet is reclaimed swamp that contains porous, highly permeable coral blocks that allow the tidal forcing of salt water.  There was extensive swamp reclamation during World War II to create the air field that is now the  |Funafuti_International_Airport|Funafuti_International_Airport| . As a consequence of the specific topographic characteristics of Fongafale, unlike other atoll islands of a similar size, Fongafale does not have a thick  |freshwater_lens|Lens| . The narrow fresh water and brackish water sheets in the sub-surface of Fongafale islet results in the  |taro|Taro|  swamps and the fresh groundwater resources of the islet being highly vulnerable to salinization resulting from the rising sea-level.     In addition to the increased risk of salinized by the sea-level rise, the freshwater lens is at risk from over extraction due to the large population that now occupies Fongafale islet; the increased extraction can be exacerbated by a decrease of the rainfall recharge rate associated with the climate change. Water pollution is also a chronic problem, with domestic wastewater identified as the primary pollution source.  Approximately 92% of households on Fongafale islet have access to septic tanks and pit toilets. However these sanitary facilities are not built as per the design specifications or they are not suitable for the geophysical characteristics, which results in seepage into the fresh water lens and run off into coastal waters.     On  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  and on the other islands, rainwater collected off the corrugated iron roofs of buildings is now the primary source of fresh water. On Funafuti a desalination unit that was donated by Japan in 2006 also provides fresh water.  In response to the  |2011_drought|2011_Tuvalu_Drought| , Japan funded the purchase of a 100 m³/d desalination plant and two portable 10 m³/d plants as part of its Pacific Environment Community program.   Aid programs from the European Union  and Australia also provided water tanks as part of the longer term solution for the storage of available fresh water.        Swamp taro , known in Tuvalu as  Pulaka , is grown in large pits of composted soil below the water table,  Pulaka has been the main source for  |carbohydrates|Carbohydrate| , it is similar to  |taro|Taro| , but with bigger leaves and larger, coarser roots .      In recent years the Tuvaluan community have raised concerns over increased salinity of the groundwater in pits that are used to cultivate pulaka.  Pits on all islands of Tuvalu  were surveyed in 2006.  |Nukulaelae|Nukulaelae|  and  |Niutao|Niutao|  each had one pit area in which salinity concentrations thought to be too high for successful swamp taro growth. However, on Fongafale in  |Funafuti|Funafuti|  all pits surveyed were either too saline or very marginal for swamp taro production, although a more salt tolerant species of  |taro|Taro|   was being grown in Fongafale.      The extent of the salinization of the aquifer on Fongafale Islet is the result of both man-made changes to the  |topography|Topography|  that occurred when the air field was built in World War II by reclaiming swamp land and excavating coral rock from other parts of the islet. These topographic changes are exacerbated by the groundwater dynamics of the islet, as tidal forcing pushes salt water into the surficial aquifer during spring tides.     The  |freshwater_lens|Lens|  of each atoll is a fragile system.  |Tropical_cyclones|Tropical_Cyclone|  and other storm events also result in wave wash over and extreme high water also occurs during spring tides. These events can result in salt water contamination of the fresh groundwater lens. Periods of low rainfall can also result in contraction of the freshwater lens as the coconut trees and other vegetation draw up the water at a greater than recharge than it can be recharged. The over extraction of ground water to supply human needs has a similar result as drought conditions.
