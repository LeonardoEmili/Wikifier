In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a square-free integer  is an  |integer|Integer|  which is  |divisible|Divisor|  by no  |perfect_square|Square_Number|  other than 1. That is, its  |prime_factorization|Prime_Factorization|  has exactly one factor for each prime that appears in it. For example,  is square-free, but  is not, because 18 is divisible by . The smallest positive square-free numbers are     :1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, ...        The  |radical_of_an_integer|Radical_Of_An_Integer|  is its largest square-free factor. An integer is square-free  |if_and_only_if|If_And_Only_If|  it is equal to its radical.     Any arbitrary positive integer  can be represented in a unique way as the product of a  |powerful_number|Powerful_Number|  and a square-free integer, which are  |coprime|Coprime| . The square-free factor, called the square-free part of the number, is the largest square-free divisor  of  that is coprime with . The square-free part of an integer may be smaller than the largest square-free divisor.     Any arbitrary positive integer  can be represented in a unique way as the product of a  |square|Square|  and a square-free integer:   : nm2 k   In this factorization,  is the largest divisor of  such that  is a divisor of .     In summary, there are three square-free factors that are naturally associated to every integer: the square-free part, the above factor , and the largest square-free factor. Each is a factor of the next one. All are easily deduced from a  |prime_factorization|Prime_Factorization| , where p1,   ph are distinct prime numbers, then the square-free part is   :   pi,   The square-free factor such the quotient is a square is   :   pi,   and the largest square-free factor is   :   pi.     For example, if n7560024  33  52  7, the square-free part is , the square-free factor such that the quotient is a square is , and the largest square-free factor is .     No algorithm is known for computing any of these square-free factors which is faster than computing the complete prime factorization. In particular, there is no known  |polynomial-time|Polynomial-Time|  algorithm for computing the square-free part of an integer, nor even for  |determining|Decision_Problem|  whether an integer is square-free.  In contrast, polynomial-time algorithms are known for  |primality_testing|Primality_Testing| .  This is a major difference between the arithmetic of the integers, and the arithmetic of the  |univariate_polynomials|Univariate_Polynomial| , as polynomial-time algorithms are known for  |square-free_factorization|Square-Free_Factorization|  of polynomials .        A positive integer n is square-free if and only if in the  |prime_factorization|Canonical_Representation_Of_A_Positive_Integer|  of n, no prime factor occurs with an exponent larger than one. Another way of stating the same is that for every prime  |factor|Divisor|  p of n, the prime p does not evenly divide  n  /  p. Also n is square-free if and only if in every factorization n    ab, the factors a and b are  |coprime|Coprime| . An immediate result of this definition is that all prime numbers are square-free.     A positive integer n is square-free if and only if all  |abelian_groups|Abelian_Group|  of  |order|Order|  n are  |isomorphic|Group_Isomorphism| , which is the case if and only if any such group is  |cyclic|Cyclic_Group| . This follows from the classification of  |finitely_generated_abelian_groups|Finitely_Generated_Abelian_Group| .     A integer n is square-free if and only if the  |factor_ring|Factor_Ring|  Z  /  nZ  is a  |product|Product_Of_Rings|  of  |fields|Field| . This follows from the  |Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese_Remainder_Theorem|  and the fact that a ring of the form Z  /  kZ is a field if and only if k is a prime.     For every positive integer n, the set of all positive divisors of n becomes a  |partially_ordered_set|Partially_Ordered_Set|  if we use  |divisibility|Divisor|  as the order relation. This partially ordered set is always a  |distributive_lattice|Distributive_Lattice| . It is a  |Boolean_algebra|Boolean_Algebra|  if and only if n is square-free.     A positive integer n is square-free  |if_and_only_if|If_And_Only_If|   & mu;  ≠  0, where μ denotes the  |Möbius_function|Möbius_Function| .       The absolute value of the Möbius function is the  |indicator_function|Indicator_Function|  for the square-free integers   that is,  is equal to 1 if  is square-free, and 0 if it is not. The  |Dirichlet_series|Dirichlet_Series|  of this indicator function is   :       where  is the  |Riemann_zeta_function|Riemann_Zeta_Function| . This follows from the  |Euler_product|Euler_Product|    :       ,   where the products are taken over the prime numbers.       Let Q denote the number of square-free integers between 1 and x . For large n, 3/4 of the positive integers less than n are not divisible by 4, 8/9 of these numbers are not divisible by 9, and so on. Because these ratios satisfy the  |multiplicative_property|Multiplicative_Function|  , we obtain the approximation:     :   &   x    x      &   x              This argument can be made rigorous for getting the estimate      : Q   + O      Sketch of a proof: the above characterization gives   : Q            observing that the last summand is zero for d /math math  .
