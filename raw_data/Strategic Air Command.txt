:For the current active command, see Air Force Global Strike Command            Strategic Air Command  was both a  |United_States_Department_of_Defense|United_States_Department_Of_Defense| |Specified_Command|List_Of_Former_Unified_Combatant_Commands|  and a  |United_States_Air_Force|United_States_Air_Force| |Major_Command|List_Of_Major_Commands_Of_The_United_States_Air_Force|  , responsible for  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  command and control of two of the three components of the U.S. militarys  |strategic_nuclear_strike_forces|Strategic_Nuclear_Weapon| , the so-called  |nuclear_triad|Nuclear_Triad| , with SAC having control of land-based  |strategic_bomber|Strategic_Bomber|  aircraft and  |intercontinental_ballistic_missiles|Intercontinental_Ballistic_Missile|  or  |ICBMs|Icbm|  .     SAC also operated all strategic  |reconnaissance_aircraft|Reconnaissance_Aircraft| , all strategic airborne command post aircraft, and all USAF  |aerial_refueling|Tanker_Aircraft|  aircraft, to include those in the  |Air_Force_Reserve|Air_Force_Reserve|   and  |Air_National_Guard|Air_National_Guard|  .     However, SAC did not operate the  |KB-50,_WB-50|B-50_Superfortress|  and  |WB-47|Boeing_B-47_Stratojet|  weather reconnaissance aircraft operated through the mid and late 1960s by the  |Air_Weather_Service|Air_Weather_Service| , nor did SAC operate the  |HC-130|Hc-130|  or  |MC-130|Mc-130|  operations aircraft capable of aerial refueling helicopters that were assigned to  |Tactical_Air_Command|Tactical_Air_Command|  , then  |Military_Airlift_Command|Military_Airlift_Command|  , and from 1990 onward, those MC-130 aircraft operated by the  |Air_Force_Special_Operations_Command|Air_Force_Special_Operations_Command|  , or any  |AFRES|Afres|   or ANG tactical aerial refueling aircraft operationally gained by TAC, MAC or AFSOC.     SAC primarily consisted of the  |Second_Air_Force|Second_Air_Force|  ,  |Eighth_Air_Force|Eighth_Air_Force|  and the  |Fifteenth_Air_Force|Fifteenth_Air_Force|  , while SAC headquarters included Directorates for Operations & Plans, Intelligence, Command & Control, Maintenance, Training, Communications, and Personnel. At a lower echelon, SAC headquarters divisions included Aircraft Engineering, Missile Concept,  and Strategic Communications.     In 1992, as part of an overall post-Cold War reorganization of the U.S. Air Force, SAC was disestablished as both a Specified Command and as a MAJCOM, and its  |personnel|:Category:Strategic_Air_Command_Personnel|  and  |equipment|Strategic_Air_Command_Equipment|  redistributed among the  |Air_Combat_Command|Air_Combat_Command|  ,  |Air_Mobility_Command|Air_Mobility_Command|  ,  |Pacific_Air_Forces|Pacific_Air_Forces|  ,  |United_States_Air_Forces_in_Europe|United_States_Air_Forces_In_Europe|  , and  |Air_Education_and_Training_Command|Air_Education_And_Training_Command|  , while SACs central headquarters complex at  |Offutt_AFB|Offutt_Afb| , Nebraska was concurrently transferred to the newly created  |United_States_Strategic_Command|United_States_Strategic_Command|  , which was established as a joint  |Unified_Combatant_Command|Unified_Combatant_Command|  to replace SACs Specified Command role.     In 2009, SACs previous USAF MAJCOM role was reactivated and redesignated as the  |Air_Force_Global_Strike_Command|Air_Force_Global_Strike_Command|  , with AFGSC eventually acquiring claimancy and control of all USAF bomber aircraft and the USAF strategic  |ICBM|Icbm|  force.           The Strategic Air Forces of the United States during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  included  |General|General| |Carl_Spaatzs|Carl_Spaatz|  European command,  |United_States_Strategic_Air_Forces_in_Europe|United_States_Strategic_Air_Forces_In_Europe|  , consisting of the 8AF and 15AF, and the  |United_States_Strategic_Air_Forces_in_the_Pacific|United_States_Strategic_Air_Forces_In_The_Pacific|  and its  |Twentieth_Air_Force|Twentieth_Air_Force|  .      The  |U.S._Army_Air_Forces|U.S._Army_Air_Forces|  first mission in the  |Strategic_Bombing_Campaign|Combined_Bomber_Offensive|  in the  |European_Theater|European_Theater|  during World War II included the  |VIII_Bomber_Command|Viii_Bomber_Command| ,  |which_conducted_the_first_European_heavy_bomber_attack_by_the_USAAF_on_17_August_1942|List_Of_Air_Operations_During_The_Battle_Of_Europe| ; the  |Ninth_Air_Force|Ninth_Air_Force| , which conducted the first  |Operation_Crossbow|Operation_Crossbow|  No-Ball missions on 5 December 1943;  the  |Twelfth_Air_Force|Twelfth_Air_Force| ; and the  |Fifteenth_Air_Force|Fifteenth_Air_Force| ,  |which_executed_bombing_operations_on_2_November_1943|Bombing_Of_Wiener_Neustadt_In_World_War_Ii|  during  |Operation_Pointblank|Operation_Pointblank| .     The  |Operation_Overlord_air_plan|Combined_Bomber_Offensiveoverlord_Air_Plan|  for the strategic bombing of both Germany and German military forces in continental Europe prior to the  |1944_invasion_of_France|Operation_Overlord|  used several Air Forces, primarily those of the  |USAAF|Usaaf|  and those of the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  , with command of air operations transferring to the  |Supreme_Commander_of_the_Allied_Expeditionary_Force|Supreme_Commander_Of_The_Allied_Expeditionary_Force|  on 14 April 1944.     Planning to reorganize for a separate and independent postwar U.S. Air Force had begun by the fall of 1945, with the  |Simpson_Board|William_Hood_Simpson|  tasked to plan, ...the reorganization of the Army and the Air Force... . In January 1946, Generals  |Eisenhower|Dwight_D._Eisenhower|  and  |Spaatz|Carl_Andrew_Spaatz|  agreed on an Air Force organization composed of the Strategic Air Command, the  |Air_Defense_Command|Air_Defense_Command| , the  |Tactical_Air_Command|Tactical_Air_Command| , the  |Air_Transport_Command|Air_Transport_Command|  and the supporting  |Air_Technical_Service_Command|Air_Technical_Service_Command| ,  |Air_Training_Command|Air_Education_And_Training_Command| , the  |Air_University|Air_University| , and the  |Air_Force_Center|Army_Air_Forces_School_Of_Applied_Tacticslineage| .                Strategic Air Command was originally established in the  |U.S._Army_Air_Forces|U.S._Army_Air_Forces|  on 21 March 1946, acquiring part of the personnel and facilities of the  |Continental_Air_Forces|Continental_Air_Forces|  , the World War II command tasked with the air defense of the continental United States . At the time, CAF headquarters was located at  |Bolling_Field|Bolling_Field|   in the District of Columbia and SAC assumed occupancy of its headquarters facilities until relocating SAC headquarters to nearby  |Andrews_Field|Andrews_Field|  , Maryland as a tenant activity until assuming control of Andrews Field in October 1946.      SAC initially totaled 37,000 USAAF personnel.  In addition to Bolling Field and, seven months later, Andrews Field, SAC also assumed responsibility for:    |Roswell_AAF|Walker_Air_Force_Base| , New Mexico , then home of the USAAFs sole nuclear-capable bomb wing, and    |Smoky_Hill_AAF|Schilling_Air_Force_Base| , Kansas      SAC also had seven additional CAF bases transferred on 21 March 1946 which remained in SAC through the 1947 establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service. Those installations included:    |Castle_Field|Castle_Air_Force_Base| , California     |Clovis_AAF|Cannon_Air_Force_Base| , New Mexico     |Fort_Worth_AAF|Carswell_Air_Force_Base| , Texas     |Davis-Monthan_Field|Davis-Monthan_Air_Force_Base| , Arizona     |Rapid_City_AAF|Ellsworth_Air_Force_Base| , South Dakota     |MacDill_Field|Macdill_Air_Force_Base| , Florida     |Mountain_Home_AAF|Mountain_Home_Air_Force_Base| , Idaho      On 31 March 1946, the following additional installation was also assigned to SAC:    |Kirtland_Field|Kirtland_Air_Force_Base| , New Mexico      Under the first SAC  |Commander_in_Chief|List_Of_Commanders-In-Chief_Of_The_Strategic_Air_Command| , General  |George_C._Kenney|George_C._Kenney| , initial units reporting to the Strategic Air Command headquarters on 21 March 1946 included the  |Second_Air_Force|Second_Air_Force| , the  |IX_Troop_Carrier_Command|Ix_Troop_Carrier_Command|  and the  |73d_Air_Division|73D_Air_Division| .      |Fifteenth_Air_Force|Fifteenth_Air_Force|  was assigned to SAC on 31 March , while the IX Troop Carrier Command was inactivated the same date and its assets redistributed within SAC.     With postwar demobilization still underway, eight of the ten assigned bomb groups were inactivated before the  |Eighth_Air_Force|Eighth_Air_Force|  was assigned to SAC on 7 June 1946      Despite the pressures of demobilization, SAC continued the training and evaluation of bomber crews and units still on active duty in the postwar Army Air Forces.  |Radar_Bomb_Scoring|Radar_Bomb_Scoring|  became the preferred method of evaluating bomber crews, with the last of  |888_simulated_bomb_runs_scored|Radar_Bomb_Scoring|  against a bombing site near  |San_Diego|San_Diego| , California during 1946, subsequently increasing to 2,449 bomb runs by 1947.   In the wake of the successful employment of air-dropped nuclear weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki to effectively end World War II, SAC became the focus of the nations nuclear strike capability, to the extent that  |Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff|Joint_Chiefs_Of_Staff|  Publication 1259/27 on 12 December 1946 identified that, ...the air atomic strategic air force should only come under the orders of the JCS.      In addition to the strategic bombing mission, SAC also devoted significant resources to aerial reconnaissance. In 1946, SACs reconnaissance aircraft inventory consisted of F-2 photo variants of the  |C-45_Expeditor|C-45_Expeditor|  support aircraft, but by 1947 SAC had acquired an F-9C squadron consisting of twelve photo-reconnaissance variants of the  |B-17G_Flying_Fortress|B-17G_Flying_Fortress| . An  |F-13|B-29_Superfortress|  squadron, the F-13 later re-designated as the  |RB-29_Superfortress|B-29_Superfortress| , was also established. SAC conducted routine aerial reconnaissance missions near the Soviet borders or near the 12-mile international waters limit, although some missions actually penetrated into Soviet airspace. The flight profiles of these missions—above 30,000 feet and in excess of 300 knots—made interception by Soviet air forces difficult until the Soviets 1948 introduction of the  |MiG-15|Mig-15|  jet fighter.  |Project_Nanook|Project_Nanook| , the Cold Wars first Top Secret reconnaissance effort, used the first RB-29 missions for mapping and visual reconnaissance in the Arctic and along the northern Soviet coast. Later missions were Project LEOPARD along the  |Chukchi_Peninsula|Chukchi_Peninsula| , followed by Projects RICKRACK, STONEWORK, and COVERALLS.      In 1946, the US possessed only nine atomic bombs and twenty-seven  |B-29s|B-29|  capable at any one time of delivering them. Furthermore, it was later determined that an attack by the  |509th_Composite_Bomb_Group|509Th_Bomb_Wing|  during the 1947 to 1948 time frame would have required at least five to six days just to transfer custody of the bombs from  |United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission|United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission|  sites to SAC and deploy the aircraft and weapons to forward operating bases before launching nuclear strikes.

Unfortunately, postwar budget and personnel cuts had had an insidious effect on SAC as its Deputy Commander, Major General Clements McMullen, implemented mandated force reductions. This continued to wear down SAC as a command and morale plummeted. As a result, by the end of 1947, only two of SACs eleven groups were combat ready. After the 1948  |Bikini_Atoll|Bikini_Atoll|  nuclear tests, the Half Moon Joint Emergency War Plan developed in May 1948  proposed dropping 50 atomic bombs on twenty Soviet cities, with President  |Harry_S._Truman|Harry_S._Truman|  approving Half Moon during the June 1948  |Berlin_Blockade|Berlin_Blockade| , . SAC also ordered special ELINT RB-29s to detect improved Soviet  |radars|Radar|  and, in cooperation with the 51st Air Force Base Unit, SAC also monitored radioactive fallout from Soviet atomic testing on  |Novaya_Zemlya|Novaya_Zemlya| .     In terms of overall Air Force basing and infrastructure, SAC continued to acquire an ever-increasing share of USAF infrastructure and the USAF associated budget. In 1947, before the USAF was established as an independent service, construction commenced on  |Limestone_AAF|Loring_Afb| , Maine , a new SAC installation specifically designed to accommodate the  |B-36_Peacemaker|B-36_Peacemaker| .  |Fort_Dix_AAF|Mcguire_Air_Force_Base| , New Jersey ;  |Spokane_AAF|Fairchild_Air_Force_Base| , Washington ; and  |Wendover_Field|Wendover_Air_Force_Base| , Utah  were also transferred to SAC between 30 April and 1 September 1947. Following establishment of the USAF as a separate service,  |SAC_bases_in_the_United_States|List_Of_Strategic_Air_Command_Bases|  consisted of:  |Castle_Air_Force_Base|Castle_Air_Force_Base| ,

       In addition to bases under its operational control, SAC also maintained tenant wings at several bases under the control of other USAF MAJCOMs. These non-SAC bases with SAC tenants included    |Amarillo_AFB|Rick_Husband_Amarillo_International_Airportamarillo_Air_Force_Base| , Texas    |Eglin_AFB|Eglin_Afb| , Florida    |Lowry_AFB|Lowry_Afb| , Colorado    |Mather_AFB|Mather_Afb| , California    |Robins_AFB|Robins_Afb| , Georgia    |Seymour_Johnson_AFB|Seymour_Johnson_Afb| , North Carolina    |Sheppard_AFB|Sheppard_Afb| , Texas    |Wright-Patterson_AFB|Wright-Patterson_Afb| , Ohio     SAC also often maintained a tenant presence at former SAC bases that the command subsequently transferred and relinquished to other MAJCOMs, to include but not limited to:    |Altus_AFB|Altus_Afb| , Oklahoma    |Laughlin_AFB|Laughlin_Afb| , Texas    |MacDill_AFB|Macdill_Afb| , Florida    |Homestead_AFB|Homestead_Afb| , Florida    |Travis_AFB|Travis_Afb| , California                  SAC transferred to the United States Air Force on 26 September 1947, concurrent with the latters establishment as a separate military service. Units directly under SAC HQ included the 8AF and 15AF, as well as the  |311th_Air_Division|311Th_Air_Division| ,  |4th_Fighter_Wing|4Th_Fighter_Wing|  ,  |82nd_Fighter_Wing|82Nd_Fighter_Wing|  ,  |307th_Bomb_Wing|307Th_Bomb_Wing|  , and two reconnaissance units, the  |311th_Reconnaissance_Wing|311Th_Reconnaissance_Wing|  and the  |46th_Reconnaissance_Squadron|46Th_Reconnaissance_Squadron|  .   The  |56th_Fighter_Wing|56Th_Fighter_Wing|  was subsequently assigned to SAC on 1 October 1947.     Following the establishment of the U.S. Air Force, most SAC installations on U.S. territory were renamed as Air Force Base during late 1947 and into 1948, while non-U.S. installations were renamed as Air Base.       In May 1948, in an exercise versus  |Air_Defense_Commands|Air_Defense_Command|  Blue force, a SAC Red strike force simulated attacks on  |Eastern_Seaboard|Eastern_Seaboard_Of_The_United_States|  targets as far south as Virginia.   After a scathing 1948  |Lindbergh|Charles_A._Lindbergh|  review of SAC operations in the air and at six SAC bases, General Kenney was removed as Commanding General on 15 October 1948 and replaced on 19 October 1948 by 8AFs commander, Lieutenant General  |Curtis_LeMay|Curtis_Lemay| . Upon Lemays assumption of command, SAC had only 60 nuclear-capable aircraft, none of which possessed a realistic long range capability against the Soviet Union.     The B-29D, which had become the  |B-50|B-50_Superfortress|  in December 1945,  was first delivered to SAC in June 1948. This was followed by SACs first Convair  |B-36_Peacemaker|B-36_Peacemaker|  bomber arriving at  |Kirtland_AFB|Kirtland_Afb| , New Mexico in September 1948.      In November 1948, LeMay had SACs headquarters and its command post moved from  |Andrews_AFB|Andrews_Afb| , Maryland to  |Offutt_AFB|Offutt_Afb| , Nebraska. At Offutt, the command moved into the A Building, a three-story facility which had previously been used by the  |Glenn_L._Martin_Company|Glenn_L._Martin_Company|  during World War II. Concurrent with establishment of this new headquarters facility, Lemay also increased SAC  |Radar_Bomb_Scoring|Radar_Bomb_Scoring|  runs the same year to 12,084. SAC also enhanced its organic fighter escort capability by initiating replacement of its World War II vintage piston-engine  |F-51D_Mustang|North_American_P-51_Mustang|  and  |F-82E_Twin_Mustang|F-82E_Twin_Mustang|  fighter aircraft with  |F-84G_Thunderjets|F-84G_Thunderjet| .     In January 1949, SAC conducted simulated raids on  |Wright-Patterson_AFB|Wright-Patterson_Afb| , Ohio. Assessments of these simulated raids by, ...LeMays entire command...were appalling,  despite the SAC deputy commander, Major General McMullen, having instructed all bomber units to improve their effectiveness. To motivate crews and improve operational effectiveness command-wide, SAC established  |a_competition,_the_first_so-called_Bomb_Comp|Fairchild_Trophy|  in 1948. Winners of this inaugural event were the  |43rd_Bombardment_Group|43Rd_Bombardment_Group|  and, for aircrew award, a B-29 team from the  |509th_Bombardment_Group|509Th_Bombardment_Group| .      Given its global operating environment, SAC also opened its own survival school at  |Camp_Carson|Camp_Carson| , Colorado in 1949, later moving this school to  |Stead_AFB|Stead_Afb| , Nevada in 1952 before transferring the school to the  |Air_Training_Command|Air_Training_Command|  in 1954.      SAC also created  |Emergency_War_Plan|Emergency_War_Plan|  1–49 , which outlined the means for delivering 133 atomic bombs, ...the entire stockpile...in a single massive attack... on 70 Soviet cities over a 30-day period.      The first Soviet atomic bomb test occurred on 29 August 1949 and the  |Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff|Joint_Chiefs_Of_Staff|  subsequently identified SACs primary objective was to damage or destroy the Soviet Unions ability to deliver nuclear weapons. The JCS further defined SACs secondary objective was to stop any Soviet advances into Western Europe, and its tertiary objective was the previous EWP 1–49 industrial mission.       In July 1950, in response to combat operations on the Korean peninsula, SAC dispatched ten nuclear-capable bombers to  |Guam|Andersen_Afb|   and deployed four B-29 bomber wings in Korea for tactical operations, although this action caused SAC commander Lemay to comment,  ...too many splinters were being whittled off the stick  ..     Initial SAC B-29 successes against North Korea in the summer of 1950 were countered by subsequent Soviet  |MiG-15|Mig-15|  fighter-interceptors, and SACs  |27th_Fighter_Escort_Wing|27Th_Special_Operations_Wing|  began escorting the bombers with F–84 Thunderjets.  |Ground-directed_bombing|Ground-Directed_Bombing|  was subsequently used for  |close_air_support|Close_Air_Support|  missions after three SAC radar bomb scoring squadron detachments arrived at  |Pusan|Pusan,_South_Korea|  in September 1950  . In 1951, SAC began to eliminate its combat groups , transferring medium bombardment groups to  |Far_East_Air_Forces|Far_East_Air_Forces|  Bomber Command for combat.  In 1951, LeMay convinced the Air Staff to allow SAC to approve nuclear targets, and he continued refusing to submit war plans for JCS review, which the JCS eventually came to accept      Although experimented with prior to World War II, SAC refined aerial refueling to a fine art. SACs in-flight refueling mission began in July 1952 when its  |31st_Fighter-Escort_Wing|31St_Fighter-Escort_Wing|  refueled sixty  |F-84G_Thunderjets|F-84G_Thunderjet|  from  |Turner_AFB|Turner_Air_Force_Base| , Georgia to  |Travis_AFB|Travis_Air_Force_Base| , California non-stop with fuel from twenty-four  |KB-29P_Superfortress|Kb-29P_Superfortress| es modified into aerial tankers. Exercise FOX PETER ONE followed with 31st FEW fighters being refueled  |Hickam_AFB|Hickam_Afb|  en route to Hawaii.      On 15 March 1953, a  |38th_Strategic_Reconnaissance_Squadron|38Th_Strategic_Reconnaissance_Squadron|  RB-50 returned fire on a Soviet MiG-15, while a  |343d_Strategic_Reconnaissance_Squadron|343D_Strategic_Reconnaissance_Squadron|  RB-50 was shot down over the  |Sea_of_Japan|Sea_Of_Japan|  2 days after the Korean Armistice, while on 7 November 1954, an RB-29 was shot down near  |Hokkaido_Island|Hokkaido_Island|  in northern Japan. By the time of 27 July 1953 Korean War cease-fire, SAC B-29s had flown over 21,000 sorties and dropped nearly 167,000 tons of bombs, with thirty-four B-29s lost in combat and forty-eight B-29s were lost to damage or crashes.               SACs first jet strategic bomber was the  |swept-wing_B-47|B-47_Stratojet|   medium bomber, which first entered service in 1951 and became operational within SAC in 1953. The B-47 was a component of the October 1953  New Look  strategy, which articulated, in part, that: ...to minimize the threat Joint Chiefs of Staff summary ...the major purpose of air defense was not to shoot down enemy bombers—it was to allow SAC ...to get into the air--and not be destroyed on the ground--to allow massive retaliation . .  |House_of_Commons_of_Canada|House_Of_Commons_Of_Canada|  transcript . Note:  |Massive_retaliation|Massive_Retaliation|  was espoused publicly in January 1954 by Eisenhowers Secretary of State,  |John_Foster_Dulles|John_Foster_Dulles|      Concern of a  |bomber_gap|Bomber_Gap|  grew after the 1955  |Soviet_Aviation_Day|Soviet_Aviation_Day|  and the Soviets rejected the  |Open_Skies|Treaty_On_Open_Skies|  Treaty proposed at the  |Geneva_Summit|Geneva_Summit|  on 21 July 1955. US bomber strength peaked with over 2,500 bombers after production of over 2,000 B-47s and almost 750 B-52s .     In an effort to concurrently enhance it reconnaissance capabilities, SAC also received several  |RB-57D_Canberra|Martin_Rb-57D_Canberra|  aircraft   |in_April_1956|4080Th_Strategic_Reconnaissance_Wing| , with the aircraft initially based at  |Turner_AFB|Turner_Afb| , Georgia. In 1957, these aircraft were forward deployed to  |Rhein-Main_Air_Base|Rhein-Main_Air_Base| , West Germany, in order to conduct reconnaissance missions along the borders of the Soviet Union and other  |Warsaw_Pact|Warsaw_Pact|  nations. However, an unintended consequence of this deployment was that  |Hawker_Hunter|Hawker_Hunter|  fighters of the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force|  stationed in the United Kingdom and in continental Europe often intercepted these classified RB-57 missions as they returned to Rhein-Main AB from over the Baltic.      Since it was designed as a medium bomber, SACs  |B-47_Stratojet|B-47_Stratojet|  traded speed for range. Because of this shorter range, and in order to better enable the B-47 fleet to reach its target sets in the Soviet Union, SAC routinely deployed its US-based B-47 wings to overseas forward operating bases in North Africa, Spain and Turkey. This program, in effect from 1957 to 1966, was known as Reflex with  |Sixteenth_Air_Force|Sixteenth_Air_Force|  , a SAC  |numbered_air_force|Numbered_Air_Force|  permanently stationed in Europe, having tactical and administrative control of the forward deployed aircraft and units.     Beginning in 1955, SAC also moved a portion of its bomber and aerial refueling aircraft to a 24-hour alert status, either on the ground or airborne. By 1960, fully one third of SACs bombers and aerial refueling aircraft were on 24-hour alert, with those crews and aircraft not already airborne ready to take off from designated alert sites at their respective bases within fifteen minutes. Bomber aircraft on ground alert were armed with nuclear weapons while aerial tanker aircraft were sufficiently fueled to provide maximum combat fuel offload to the bombers.      Concurrent with this increased alert posture and in order to better hone strategic bombing skillsets, the 1955  |SAC_Bombing_and_Navigation_Competition|Fairchild_Trophy|  was characterized by radar bomb scoring runs on Amarillo,  |Denver|Lowry_Bombing_And_Gunnery_Rangedenver_Bomb_Plot| , Salt Lake City, Kansas City, San Antonio  and Phoenix;  and the 1957 competition  . Flightglobal.com . Retrieved on 2013-09-18. had three targets:  |Atlanta|Statesboro_Bomb_Scoring_Site| , Kansas City, and St. Louis.  This use of RBS with simulated target areas utilizing mobile and fixed bomb scoring sites adjacent to major cities, industrial areas, military installations and dedicated bombing ranges throughout the United States. This format would continue through successive SAC Bombing and Navigation Competitions through the remainder of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Commencing in the late 1950s, in addition to representation from every SAC wing with a bombing and/or air refueling mission, later SAC competitions would also include participating bomber and aerial refueling units from the  |Royal_Air_Forces|Royal_Air_Force| |Bomber_Command|Raf_Bomber_Command|  and its successor,  |RAF_Strike_Command|Raf_Strike_Command| .     Nuclear Bunkers, SAC Ground Alert, and transfer of SACs Fighter-Escort Wings    It was described as the Western Pentagon, specifically a, ...four-story, reinforced concrete and masonry office building... above ground and a ...segregated, adjacent three-story below ground command post. This was the description of what would become Building 500 at  |Offutt_AFB|Offutt_Afb|  and the new headquarters complex built expressly for SAC, with construction commencing in 1955. SAC headquarters moved from the A Building at Offutt AFB to Building 500 in 1957. The underground  |nuclear_bunker|Nuclear_Bunker|  had 24-inch thick walls and base floor, 10-inch thick intermediate floors, and 24-to-42-inch thick roof. It also contained a war room with six 16-foot data display screens and the capacity to sustain up to 800 people underground for two weeks. The below ground bunker portion of the headquarters complex also contained an  |IBM_704|Ibm_704|  computer, which was used to develop monthly weather forecasts at targets, as well as for computing fuel consumption and fallout cloud patterns for planning strike routes and egress routes .   |Public_Broadcasting_System|Public_Broadcasting_System|       In 1957, SAC also constructed  |The_Notch|The_Notch| , a facility alternatively known as the 8th Air Force Combat Operations Center and the Westover Communications Annex, since it was a sub-post of nearby  |Westover_AFB|Westover_Afb| . A 3-story nuclear bunker located on  |Bare_Mountain,_Massachusetts|Bare_Mountain| , The Notch was built with three-foot thick walls, 1.5 foot thick steel blast doors, and 20 feet underground to protect 350 people for 35 days.  The Notch was shut down as a SAC facility in 1970 when 8th Air Force was relocated to  |Barksdale_AFB|Barksdale_Afb| , Louisiana.     Despite this investment in hardened headquarters and command and control facilities, the 1957  |Gaither_Commission|Gaither_Report|  identified, ...little likelihood of SACs bombers surviving since there was no way  |to_detect_an_incoming_attack|Ballistic_Missile_Early_Warning_System|  until the first warhead landed.  As a result, SACs bombers and tankers began sitting armed ground alert at their respective bases on 1 Oct 57.      In another organizational change during this time period, SACs fighter escort wings were transferred to  |Tactical_Air_Command|Tactical_Air_Command|  during 1957 and 1958.  Finally, during January 1958s Exercise Fir Fly, SAC faker aircraft simulated bombing strikes against metropolitan areas and military installations in the United States defended by Air Defense Commands  |28th_Air_Division|28Th_Air_Division| .                After SACs  |1st_Missile_Division|1St_Missile_Division|  was activated on 18 March 1957, SAC HQ established the Office of Assistant CINCSAC at the  |Air_Force_Ballistic_Missile_Division|Air_Force_Ballistic_Missile_Division|  in California on 1 January 1958. SAC MIKE was responsible for missile development liaison, the intermediate range  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  and  |Thor|Pgm-17A_Thor|  missiles having been transferred to SAC for alert in 1958.       Beginning on 1 February 1958, a SAC Liaison Team was also located at the  |NORAD|Norad|  Command Post at  |Ent_AFB|Ent_Afb| , Colorado, and the two commands agreed that direct land line communications should connect SAC bases with NORADs  |Air_Defense_Direction_Centers|Air_Defense_Direction_Center| . Also in the late 1950s, SAC continued to enhance its intelligence collection activities and develop innovative means of improving the survivability of its forces to surprise attack. From 1958–, a SAC Detachment operated at  |Incirlik_AB|Incirlik_Ab| , Turkey, monitoring Soviet missile telemetry from the  |Kapustin_Yar|Kapustin_Yar|  and  |Tyuratam|Tyuratam|  launch complexes, while in 1959, SACs  |Operation_Big_Star|Operation_Big_Star|  studied, prototyped and evaluated the potential of deploying of  |Minuteman_I|Minuteman|  ICBMs on civilian railroad tracks via USAF-operated locomotives and trains.     President Eisenhower approved the first  |Atlas|Atlas|  ICBM launch by a SAC crew for 9 September 1959 at Vandenberg AFB.      While missile operations continued to ramp up, robust training for flight crews to ensure survivability for strike missions also continued. In some instances SAC bombers would oppose ADC fighter-interceptors simulating Soviet interceptors. Conversely, SAC assisted ADC readiness by simulating Soviet bomber threats to the continental United States that ADC fighters would respond to. However, following a mid-air collision between an ADC  |F-102|F-102|  and a SAC  |B-47|B-47|  during a 17 December 1959 Quick Kick exercise, simulated NORAD fighter attacks were prohibited against SAC bombers.  On 19 December 1959, NORAD and SAC informed their unlts that, for the interim, no fighter attacks against bomber aircraft would be allowed. The order was issued as a result of a mid-air collision on 17 December between an F-102 and a B-47 engaged in exercise  |Quick_Kick|Quick_Kick| .      On 18 March 1960, SAC intercontinental missiles began alert at Maines  |Snark_Missile_Launch_Complex|Snark_Missile_Launch_Complex|  adjacent to  |Presque_Isle_AFB|Presque_Isle_Air_Force_Base| . The following month, on 22 April 1960, SAC turned over the last British-based  |PGM-17_Thor|Pgm-17_Thor|  IRBM to the  |Royal_Air_Force|Royal_Air_Force| .
