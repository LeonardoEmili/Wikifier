In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a bilinear map is a  |function|Function|  combining elements of two  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space|  to yield an element of a third vector space, and is  |linear|Linear_Map|  in each of its arguments.  |Matrix_multiplication|Matrix_Multiplication|  is an example.           Let V, W and X be three  |vector_spaces|Vector_Space|  over the same base  |field|Field|    . A bilinear map is a  |function|Function|    : B : V   W   X   such that   w   W , the map Bw   : v   B   is a  |linear_map|Linear_Map|  from V to X , and   v   V , the map Bv   : w   B   is a linear map from W to X .     In other words, when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed.     If  and we have  for all v, w in V, then we say that B is  symmetric .     The case where X is the base field F, and we have a  bilinear form , is particularly useful .       The definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field F, we use  |modules|Module|  over a  |commutative_ring|Commutative_Ring|  R. It generalizes to n-ary functions, where the proper term is  multilinear .     For non-commutative rings R and S, a left R-module M and a right S-module N, a bilinear map is a map  with T an - |bimodule|Bimodule| , and for which any n in N,  is an R-module homomorphism, and for any m in M,  is an S-module homomorphism. This satisfies     :B r ⋅ B   :B B ⋅ s     for all m in M, n in N, r in R and s in S, as well as B being  |additive|Additive_Map|  in each argument.       A first immediate consequence of the definition is that  whenever  or . This may be seen by writing the  |zero_vector|Zero_Vector|  0 V as   and moving the scalar 0 outside , in front of B, by linearity.     The set  of all bilinear maps is a  |linear_subspace|Linear_Subspace|  of the space  of all maps from  into X.          If V, W, X are  |finite-dimensional|Finite-Dimensional| , then so is . For , i.e. bilinear forms, the dimension of this space is  . To see this, choose a  |basis|Basis|  for V and W; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix , and vice versa.   Now, if X is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have .        |Matrix_multiplication|Matrix|  is a bilinear map .   If a  |vector_space|Vector_Space|  V over the  |real_numbers|Real_Number|  R carries an  |inner_product|Inner_Product_Space| , then the inner product is a bilinear map .   In general, for a vector space V over a field F, a  |bilinear_form|Bilinear_Form|  on V is the same as a bilinear map .   If V is a vector space with  |dual_space|Dual_Space|  V ∗ , then the application operator,  is a bilinear map from  to the base field.   Let V and W be vector spaces over the same base field F. If f is a member of V ∗ and g a member of W ∗ , then  defines a bilinear map .   The  |cross_product|Cross_Product|  in R 3 is a bilinear map .   Let  be a bilinear map, and  be a  |linear_map|Linear_Map| , then  is a bilinear map on  .
