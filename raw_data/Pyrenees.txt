      The Pyrenees  is a  |range_of_mountains|Mountain_Range|  in southwest  |Europe|Europe|  that forms a  |natural_border|Natural_Border|  between  |Spain|Spain|  and  |France|France| . Reaching a height of  altitude at the peak of  |Aneto|Aneto| , the range separates the  |Iberian_Peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula|  from the rest of  |continental_Europe|Continental_Europe| , and extends for about  from the  |Bay_of_Biscay|Bay_Of_Biscay|   to the  |Mediterranean_Sea|Mediterranean_Sea|  .     For the most part, the main crest forms a divide between Spain and France, with the  |microstate|Microstate|  of  |Andorra|Andorra|  sandwiched in between. The  |Principality_of_Catalonia|Principality_Of_Catalonia|  alongside with the  |Kingdom_of_Aragon|Kingdom_Of_Aragon|  in the  |Crown_of_Aragon|Crown_Of_Aragon| ,  |Occitania|Occitania|  and the  |Kingdom_of_Navarre|Kingdom_Of_Navarre|  have historically extended on both sides of the mountain range, with smaller northern portions now in France and larger southern parts now in Spain. Preamble of the          In  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology| ,  |Pyrene|Pyrene|  is a princess who  |gave_her_name|Eponym|  to the Pyrenees. The  |Greek_historian|Greek_Historiography| |_Herodotus|Herodotus|  says Pyrene is the name of a town in  |Celtic_Europe|Celts| .  |Herodotus|Herodotus| , Histories   According to  |Silius_Italicus|Silius_Italicus| ,  |Silius_Italicus|Silius_Italicus| , Punica 3.415–441. she was the virgin daughter of  |Bebryx|Bebryx| , a king in  |Mediterranean_Gaul|Narbonensis|  by whom the hero  |Hercules|Hercules|  was given  |hospitality|Hospitality|  during his  |quest|Quest|  to steal the cattle of  |Geryon|Geryon|  Although  |Geryon|Geryon|  was usually located in the mythical west of the setting sun, he was also associated with  |Iberia|Iberia| ; according to  |Strabo|Strabo| , his triple-body was preserved at  |Cadiz|Cadiz|  in the form of a tree. during his famous  |Labours|Labours_Of_Hercules| . Hercules, characteristically drunk and lustful, violates the sacred code of hospitality and rapes his hosts daughter. Pyrene gives birth to a serpent and runs away to the woods, afraid that her father will be angry. Alone, she pours out her story to the trees, attracting the attention of wild beasts who tear her to pieces.     After his victory over Geryon, Hercules passes through the kingdom of Bebryx again, finding the girls lacerated remains. As is often the case in stories of this hero, the sober Hercules responds with heartbroken grief and remorse at the actions of his darker self, and lays Pyrene to rest tenderly, demanding that the surrounding geography join in mourning and preserve her name: Ben Tipping, Exemplary Epic: Silius Italicus Punica , pp. 20–21  struck by Herculean voice, the mountaintops shudder at the ridges; he kept crying out with a sorrowful noise Pyrene! and all the rock-cliffs and wild-beast haunts echo back Pyrene! … The mountains hold on to the wept-over name through the ages.  |Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny_The_Elder|  connects the story of Hercules and Pyrene to  |Lusitania|Lusitania| , but rejects it as fabulosa, highly fictional.  |Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny_The_Elder| , Natural History       Other classical sources derived the name from the Greek word for fire,  . Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography   William Smith, LLD, Ed.   According to Greek historian  |Diodorus_Siculus|Diodorus_Siculus|  ..in ancient times, we are told, certain herdsmen left a fire and the whole area of the mountains was entirely consumed; and due to this fire, since it raged continuously day after day, the surface of the earth was also burned and the mountains, because of what had taken place, were called the Pyrenees.  |Diodorus_Siculus|Diodorus_Siculus| , The Library of History Vol III, 35           The Spanish Pyrenees are part of the following  |provinces|Provinces_Of_Spain| , from east to west:  |Girona|Girona_Province| ,  |Barcelona|Barcelona_Province| ,  |Lleida|Lleida_Province|  ,  |Huesca|Huesca_Province|  ,  |Navarra|Navarra|   and  |Gipuzkoa|Gipuzkoa|  .     The French Pyrenees are part of the following  département s, from east to west:  |Pyrénées_Orientales|Pyrénées_Orientales|  ,  |Aude|Aude| ,  |Ariège|Ariège| ,  |Haute_Garonne|Haute_Garonne| ,  |Hautes_Pyrénées|Hautes_Pyrénées| , and  |Pyrénées_Atlantiques|Pyrénées_Atlantiques|  .     The independent principality of  |Andorra|Andorra|  is sandwiched in the eastern portion of the mountain range between the  |Spanish_Pyrenees|Spanish_Pyrenees|  and  |French_Pyrenees|French_Pyrenees| .                               |Physiographically|Physical_Geography| , the Pyrenees may be divided into three sections: the Atlantic , the Central, and the Eastern Pyrenees. Together, they form a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System division.     In the Western Pyrenees, from the  |Basque_mountains|Basque_Mountains|  near the  |Bay_of_Biscay|Bay_Of_Biscay|  of the Atlantic Ocean, the average elevation gradually increases from west to east.     The Central Pyrenees extend eastward from the  |Somport|Somport|  pass to the  |Aran_Valley|Aran_Valley| , and they include the highest summits of this range:    |Pico_dAneto|Pico_Daneto|   in the Maladeta ridge,    |Pico_Posets|Pico_Posets|  ,    |Monte_Perdido|Monte_Perdido|  .     In the Eastern Pyrenees, with the exception of one break at the eastern extremity of the Pyrénées Ariègeoises in the  |Ariège|Ariège|  area, the mean elevation is remarkably uniform until a sudden decline occurs in the easternmost portion of the chain known as the  |Albères|Albera_Massif| .          Most  |foothills|Foothill|  of the Pyrenees are on the Spanish side, where there is a large and complex system of ranges stretching from Spanish  |Navarre|Navarre| , across northern Aragon and into Catalonia, almost reaching the  |Mediterranean|Mediterranean|  coast with summits reaching .   At the eastern end on the southern side lies a distinct area known as the  |Sub_Pyrenees|Sub_Pyrenees| . Jordi Sacasas i Lluís, Geografía de Catalunya, Publicacions LAbadia de Montserrat.      On the French side the slopes of the main range descend abruptly and there are no foothills except in the  |Corbières_Massif|Corbières_Massif|  in the northeastern corner of the mountain system. Christophe Neff : Les Corbières maritimes – forment-elles un étage de végétation méditerranéenne thermophile masqué par la pression humaine ? In: Eric Fouache : The Mediterranean World Environment and History. IAG Working Group on Geo-archeology, Symposium Proceedings. Environmental Dynamics and History in Mediterranean Areas, Paris, Université de Paris – Sorbonne 24 – 26 avril 2002. Paris, 2003, 191 – 202, .            The Pyrenees are older than the  |Alps|Alps| |sediments|Sediment|  were first deposited in coastal basins during the  |Paleozoic|Paleozoic|  and  |Mesozoic|Mesozoic|  eras. Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower  |Cretaceous|Cretaceous|  Period, the  |Bay_of_Biscay|Bay_Of_Biscay| |_fanned_out|Seafloor_Spreading| , pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense  |compressional_pressure|Compression|  to large layers of  |sedimentary_rock|Sedimentary_Rock| . The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earths crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the  |Eocene|Eocene|  Epoch.     The eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of  |granite|Granite|  and  |gneiss|Gneiss| ose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of  |limestone|Limestone| . The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of  |granite|Granite| , which is particularly resistant to  |erosion|Erosion| , as well as weak  |glacial|Glacier|  development.     The upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a  |peneplain|Peneplain| . This peneplain originated no earlier than in  |Late_Miocene|Miocene|  times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local  |base_level|Base_Level|  considerably.        Conspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:   the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps   the rarity and relative high elevation of usable  |passes|Mountain_Pass|    the large number of the mountain torrents locally called  gaves , which often form lofty  |waterfalls|Waterfall| , surpassed in Europe only by those of  |Scandinavia|Scandinavia|    the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a  |cirque|Cirque| .     The highest  |waterfall|Waterfall|  is  |Gavarnie|Gavarnie_Falls|  , at the head of the  |Gave_de_Pau|Gave_De_Pau| ; the  |Cirque_de_Gavarnie|Cirque_De_Gavarnie| , in the same valley, together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and  |Cirque_dEstaubé|Cirque_Destaubé| , are notable examples of the  |cirque|Cirque|  formation.     Low passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level. The main passes of note are:   the  |Col_de_la_Perche|Col_De_La_Perche|  , towards the east, between the valley of the  |Têt|Têt_River|  and the valley of the  |Segre|River_Segre| ,   the  |Pas_de_la_Casa_or_Port_dEnvalira|Pas_De_La_Casa| , the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at , and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,   the nearby  |Col_de_Puymorens|Col_De_Puymorens|  , on  |European_route_E09|European_Route_E09|  between France and Spain.   the  |Port_de_la_Bonaigua|Port_De_La_Bonaigua|  , in the middle of the range at the head of the Aran Valley, although the nearly col at Plan de Beret  is the lowest point in the main ridge between the Col de la Perche, almost  to the east and the  |Col_du_Pourtalet|Col_Du_Pourtalet|  , over  to the west.   the Col de  |Somport|Somport|  or Port de Canfranc , where there were old  |Roman_roads|Roman_Road| .   the  |Roncevaux_Pass|Roncevaux_Pass|  , entirely in  |Navarre|Navarre|  is an important point on the  |Santiago_de_Compostela|Santiago_De_Compostela|  pilgrimage route   Because of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been created, beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira, and Puymorens and new routes in the center of the range at  |Bielsa|Bielsa|  and  |Vielha|Vielha_Tunnel| .     A notable visual feature of this  |mountain_range|Mountain_Range|  is  |La_Brèche_de_Roland|La_Brèche_De_Roland| , a gap in the ridge line, whichaccording to legendwas created by  |Roland|Roland| .            The metallic  |ores|Ore|  of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were  |iron|Iron|  mines at several locations in  |Andorra|Geography_Of_Andorranatural_Resources| , as well as at  |Vicdessos|Vicdessos|  in Ariège, and the foot of  |Canigou|Canigou|  in  |Pyrénées_Orientales|Pyrénées_Orientales|  long ago.  |Coal|Coal|  deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of  |lignite|Lignite| . The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of  |Luzenac|Luzenac|  is one of the greatest sources of  |talc|Talc|  in Europe.      |Mineral_springs|Mineral_Spring|  are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the  |hot_springs|Hot_Spring| . The hot springs, among which those of  |Les_Escaldes|Les_Escaldes|  in Andorra,  |Panticosa|Panticosa|  and  |Lles|Lles|  in Spain,  |Ax_les_Thermes|Ax_Les_Thermes| ,  |Bagnères_de_Luchon|Bagnères_De_Luchon|  and  |Eaux_Chaudes|Eaux_Chaudes|  in France may be mentioned, are  |sulfur|Sulfur| ous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of  |Bagnères_de_Bigorre|Bagnères_De_Bigorre|  ,  |Rennes_les_Bains|Rennes_Les_Bains|  , and  |Campagne_sur_Aude|Campagne_Sur_Aude|  , are mostly selenitic and not hot.       The amount of  |precipitation|Precipitation|  the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the  |Bay_of_Biscay|Bay_Of_Biscay| . After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is -2  °C .     Sections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some  |glaciers|Glacier|  in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the  |glacial_periods|Glacial_Period| . The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the  of Hautes-Pyrénées.     The annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about 2,700 to 2,800 metres above sea level. In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above 1,600 metres between December and April.                     A still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the  |Corbières|Corbières|  stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1°, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in  |endemic|Endemic|  species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that  |endemism|Endemism|  is the occurrence of the monotypic genus Xatardia , which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val dEynes and  |Catalonia|Catalonia| . Other examples include  Arenaria montana ,  Bulbocodium vernum , and  Ranunculus glacialis . The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the  |saxifrages|Saxifrage| , several species of which are endemic here.       In their  |fauna|Fauna|  the Pyrenees present some striking instances of  |endemism|Endemism| . The  |Pyrenean_desman|Pyrenean_Desman|  is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other  |desmans|Desman|  are confined to the rivers of the  |Caucasus|Caucasus|  in southern Russia. The Pyrenean euprocte , an endemic relative of the  |salamander|Salamander| , also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the  |cave|Cave| rns of Ariège, the principal genera of which are  Anophthalmus  and Adelops.      The  |Pyrenean_ibex|Pyrenean_Ibex|  mysteriously became extinct in January 2000; the native Pyrenean  |brown_bear|Brown_Bear|  was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but it was re-introduced in 1996 when three bears were brought from  |Slovenia|Slovenia| . The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around  |Fos|Fos_Haute_Garonne| , but only four native ones are still living in the  |Aspe_Valley|Aspe_Valley| .

For their history, see also  |Almogavars|Almogavars| ,  |Marca_Hispanica|Marca_Hispanica| .     The principal languages spoken in the area are Spanish, French,  |Aragonese|Aragonese_Language| ,  |Catalan|Catalan_Language|  , and  |Basque|Basque_Language| .   Also spoken, to a lesser degree, is the  |Occitan_language|Occitan_Language| , consisting of the  |Gascon|Gascon_Language|  and  |Languedocien|Languedocien|  dialects in France and the  |Aranese|Aranese_Language|  dialect in the  |Aran_Valley|Aran_Valley| .     An important feature of rural life in the Pyrenees is  |transhumance|Transhumance| , the moving of livestock from the farms in the valleys up to the higher grounds of the mountains for the summer.  In this way the farming communities could keep larger herds than the lowland farms could support on their own. The principal animals moved were  |cows|Cows|  and  |sheep|Sheep| , but historically most members of farming families also moved to the higher pastures along with their animals, so they also took with them  |pigs|Pigs| ,  |horses|Horses|   and  |chickens|Chickens| . Transhumance thus took the form of a mass biannual migration, moving uphill in May or June  and returning to the farms in September or October. During the summer period, the families would live in basic stone cabins in the high mountains.     Nowadays, industrialisation and changing agriculture practices have diminished the custom. However, the importance of transhumance continues to be recognised through its celebration in popular festivals.        No big cities are in the range itself. The largest urban area close to the Pyrenees is  |Toulouse|Toulouse|  ,  |France|France|  with a population of 1,330,954 in its metropolitan area. On the Spanish side  |Pamplona|Pamplona| ,  is the closest city with a population of 319,208 in its metropolitan area. Inside the Pyrenees the main towns are  |Andorra_la_Vella|Andorra_La_Vella|  ,  |Jaca|Jaca|  in Spain and  |Lourdes|Lourdes|  and  |Foix|Foix|  in France.
