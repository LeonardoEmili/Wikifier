The Brunei Sultanates capital at Kota Batu was assaulted by Governor Sande who led the 1578 Spanish attack.      The word savages in Spanish, cafres, was from the word infidel in Arabic - Kafir, and was used by the Spanish to refer to their own christian savages who were arrested in Brunei.   It was said Castilians are kafir, men who have no souls, who are condemned by fire when they die, and that too because they eat pork by the Brunei Sultan after the term accursed doctrine was used to attack Islam by the Spaniards which fed into hatred between Muslims and Christians sparked by their 1571 war against Brunei.  The Sultans words were in response to insults coming from the Spanish at Manila in 1578, other Muslims from Champa, Java, Borneo, Luzon, Pahang, Demak, Aceh, and the Malays echoed the rhetoric of holy war against the Spanish and Iberian Portuguese, calling them kafir enemies which was a contrast to their earlier nuanced views of the Portuguese in the Hikayat Tanah Hitu and Sejarah Melayu.   The war by Spain against Brunei was defended in an apologia written by Doctor De Sande.  The British eventually partitioned and took over Brunei while Sulu was attacked by the British, Americans, and Spanish which caused its breakdown and downfall after both of them thrived from 1500-1900 for four centuries.  Dar al-Islam was seen as under invasion by kafirs by the Atjehnese led by Zayn al-din and by Muslims in the Philippines as they saw the Spanish invasion, since the Spanish brought the idea of a crusader holy war against Muslim Moros just as the Portuguese did in Indonesia and India against what they called Moors in their political and commercial conquests which they saw through the lens of religion in the 16th century.      In 1578, an attack was launched by the Spanish against Jolo, and in 1875 it was destroyed at their hands, and once again in 1974 it was destroyed by the Philippines.  The Spanish first set foot on Borneo in Brunei.      The Spanish war against Brunei failed to conquer Brunei but it totally cut off the Philippines from Bruneis influence, the Spanish then started colonizing Mindanao and building fortresses. In response, the Bisayas, where Spanish forces were stationed, were subjected to retaliatory attacks by the Magindanao in 1599-1600 due to the Spanish attacks on Mindanao.      The Brunei royal family was related to the Muslim Rajahs who in ruled the principality in 1570 of Manila  and this was what the Spaniards came across on their initial arrival to Manila, Spain uprooted Islam out of areas where it was shallow after they began to force Christianity on the Philippines in their conquests after 1521 while Islam was already widespread in the 16th century Philippines.  In the Philippines in the Cebu islands the natives killed the Spanish fleet leader Magellan. Borneos western coastal areas at Landak, Sukadana, and Sambas saw the growth of Muslim states in the sixteenth century, in the 15th century at Nanking, the capital of China, the death and burial of the Borneo Bruneian king Maharaja Kama took place upon his visit to China with Zheng Hes fleet.      The Spanish were expelled from Brunei in 1579 after they attacked in 1578.   There were fifty thousand inhabitants before the 1597 attack by the Spanish in Brunei.

Several provisions of these treaties caused long-standing bitterness and humiliation among the Chinese: extraterritoriality , customs regulation, and the right to station foreign warships in Chinese waters, including its navigable rivers.     Jane E.

Historians have judged the Qing dynastys vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go......In the Arrow War , the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing.

In 1880, massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to China from Antwerp as China purchased torpedoes, artillery, and 260,260 modern rifles from Europe.      The Russian military observer D. V. Putiatia visited China in 1888 and found that in Northeastern China along the Chinese-Russian border, the Chinese soldiers were potentially able to become adept at European tactics under certain circumstances, and the Chinese soldiers were armed with modern weapons like Krupp artillery, Winchester carbines, and Mauser rifles.      Compared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.      Russian sinologists, the Russian media, threat of internal rebellion, the pariah status inflicted by the Congress of Berlin, the negative state of the Russian economy all led Russia to concede and negotiate with China in St Petersburg, and return most of Ili to China.
