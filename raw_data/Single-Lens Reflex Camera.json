According to the website below, the camera used Nikon S type rangefinder lenses.      Through-the-lens light metering is also known as behind-the-lens metering . In the SLR design scheme, there were various placements made for the metering cells, all of which used CdS  photocells. The cells were either located in the pentaprism housing, where they metered light transmitted through the focusing screen; underneath the reflex mirror glass itself, which was Topcons design; or in front of the shutter mechanism, which was the design used by Canon with their Canon Pellix.

Mamiya Sekor came out with cameras such as the Mamiya Sekor TL and various other versions. Yashica introduced the TL Super. Both of these cameras used M42 screw thread lenses as did the Pentax Spotmatic. Later on Fujica introduced their ST-701, then ST-801 and ST-901 cameras. The ST-701 was the first SLR to use a silicon cell photodiode, which was more sensitive than CdS and was immune to the memory effect that the CdS cell suffered from in bright sunlight. Gradually, other 35  mm SLR camera manufacturers changed their behind-the-lens meters from CdS cells to Silicon Diode photocells.     Other manufacturers responded and introduced their own behind-the-lens metering cameras. Nikon and Miranda, at first, simply upgraded their interchangeable pentaprisms to include behind-the-lens metering and these manufacturers also bought out other camera models with built-in behind-the-lens metering capability, such as the Nikkormat FT and the Miranda Sensorex . Minolta introduced the SRT-101, which used Minoltas proprietary system they referred to as CLC , which was an acronym for contrast light compensation , which metered differently from an average metering behind-the-lens camera.

Inexpensive leaf-shutter cameras also benefited from behind-the-lens metering as, Topcon introduced the Auto 100 with front-mount interchangeable lenses designed only for that camera, and one of the Zeiss Ikon Contaflex leaf shutter cameras. Kowa manufactured their SET-R, which had similar specifications.     Within months, manufacturers decided to bring out models that provided limited area metering, such as Nikons Photomic Tn finder, which concentrated 60% of the CdS cells sensitivity on the inner circle of the focusing screen and 30% on the surrounding area. Canon used spot metering in the unusual Canon Pellix camera, which also had a stationary mirror system that allowed approximately 70% of the light to travel to the film plane and 30% to the photographers eye. This system, unfortunately, degraded the native resolution of the attached lens and provided less illumination to the eyepiece. It did have the advantage of having less vibration than other SLR cameras but this was not sufficient to attract professionals to the camera in numbers.       While auto-exposure was commonly used in the early 1960s with various 35  mm fixed lens rangefinder cameras such as the Konica Auto S, and other cameras such as the Polaroid Land cameras whose early models used selenium cell meters, auto-exposure for interchangeable lens SLRs was a feature that was largely absent, except for a few early leaf-shutter SLRs such as the Kowa SE-R and Topcon Auto 100.     The types of automation found in some of these cameras consisted of the simple programmed shutter, whereby the cameras metering system would select a mechanically set series of apertures with shutter speeds, one setting of which would be sufficient for the correct exposure. In the case of the above-mentioned Kowa and Topcon, automation was semi-automatic, where the cameras CDs meter would select the correct aperture only.     Autoexposure, technically known as semi-automatic exposure, where the cameras metering system chooses either the shutter speed or the aperture, was finally introduced by the Savoyflex and popularized by ": null

Other SLRs soon followed, but because of limitations with their lens mounts, the manufacturers of these cameras had to choose aperture-priority automation, where the cameras metering system selects the correct shutter speed.

Nikon at first produced an aperture-priority camera, but later made subtle changes on the inside of their bayonet mount, which allowed for shutter-priority automation without obsoleting the photographers lenses.            Full-program auto-exposure soon followed with the advent of the Canon A-1 in 1978. This SLR had a P mode on the shutter speed dial, and a lock on the aperture ring to allow the lens to be put on Auto mode. Other manufacturers soon followed with Nikon introducing the FA, Minolta introducing the X-700 in 1981,  and Pentax introducing the Super Program.

Other manufacturers chose to adapt their existing lens systems for autofocus capability, as was the case with Nikon and Pentax.

There are various designs for focal plane shutters. Early focal-plane shutters designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening shutter curtain followed by a closing shutter curtain. During fast shutter speeds, the focal-plane shutter would form a slit whereby the second shutter curtain was closely following the first opening shutter curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the shutter slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as shutter speeds were increased. Initially these shutters were made from a cloth material , but some manufacturers used other materials instead.
