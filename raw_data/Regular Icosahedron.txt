   In  |geometry|Geometry| , a regular icosahedron   is a convex  |polyhedron|Polyhedron|  with 20 faces, 30 edges and 12 vertices. It is one of the five  |Platonic_solids|Platonic_Solid| , and the one with the most sides.     It has five equilateral triangular faces meeting at each vertex. It is represented by its  |Schläfli_symbol|Schläfli_Symbol|  , or sometimes by its  |vertex_figure|Vertex_Figure|  as 3.3.3.3.3 or 3 5 . It is the  |dual|Dual_Polyhedron|  of the  |dodecahedron|Regular_Dodecahedron| , which is represented by , having three pentagonal faces around each vertex.     A regular icosahedron is a  |gyroelongated|Johnson_Solidnames| |pentagonal_bipyramid|Pentagonal_Bipyramid|  and a biaugmented  |pentagonal_antiprism|Pentagonal_Antiprism|  in any of six orientations.     The name comes . The plural can be either icosahedrons or icosahedra .          If the edge length of a regular icosahedron is a, the  |radius|Radius|  of a circumscribed  |sphere|Sphere|  is   : ru         a    0.951    a      and the radius of an inscribed sphere  is   : ri       a   0.755  a      while the midradius, which touches the middle of each edge, is   : rm       a a    0.809  a      where ϕ is the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio| .       The surface area A and the  |volume|Volume|  V of a regular icosahedron of edge length a are:     : A 5    8.660       : V   a3   2.181       The latter is F    20 times the volume of a general  |tetrahedron|Tetrahedron|  with apex at the center of the   inscribed sphere, where the volume of the tetrahedron is one third times the base area  times its height r i .     The volume filling factor of the circumscribed sphere is:     : f    0.605           The vertices of an icosahedron centered at the origin with an edge-length of 2 and a  |circumradius|Circumradius|  of     1.9 are described by  |circular_permutations|Circular_Shift|  of:    :   where ϕ     is the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio| .     Taking all permutations results in the  |Compound_of_two_icosahedra|Compound_Of_Two_Icosahedra| .     Note that these vertices form five sets of three concentric, mutually  |orthogonal|Orthogonal| |golden_rectangles|Golden_Rectangle| , whose edges form  |Borromean_rings|Borromean_Rings| .     If the original icosahedron has edge length 1, its dual  |dodecahedron|Dodecahedron|  has edge length   ϕ  −  1.        The 12 edges of a regular  |octahedron|Octahedron|  can be subdivided in the golden ratio so that the resulting vertices define a regular icosahedron. This is done by first placing vectors along the octahedrons edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly subdividing each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. The  |five_octahedra|Compound_Of_Five_Octahedra|  defining any given icosahedron form a regular  |polyhedral_compound|Polyhedral_Compound| , while the  |two_icosahedra|Compound_Of_Two_Icosahedra|  that can be defined in this way from any given octahedron form a  |uniform_polyhedron_compound|Uniform_Polyhedron_Compound| .            The locations of the vertices of a regular icosahedron can be described using  |spherical_coordinates|Spherical_Coordinates| , for instance as  |latitude_and_longitude|Latitude_And_Longitude| . If two vertices are taken to be at the north and south poles , then the other ten vertices are at latitude ± |arctan|Arctan|  ≈ ±26.57°. These ten vertices are at evenly spaced longitudes , alternating between north and south latitudes.     This scheme takes advantage of the fact that the regular icosahedron is a pentagonal  |gyroelongated_bipyramid|Gyroelongated_Bipyramid| , with D 5d  |dihedral_symmetry|Dihedral_Symmetry_In_Three_Dimensions| —that is, it is formed of two congruent pentagonal pyramids joined by a pentagonal  |antiprism|Antiprism| .       The icosahedron has three special  |orthogonal_projections|Orthogonal_Projection| , centered on a face, an edge and a vertex:          The icosahedron can also be represented as a  |spherical_tiling|Spherical_Tiling| , and projected onto the plane via a  |stereographic_projection|Stereographic_Projection| . This projection is  |conformal|Conformal_Map| , preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.     |nets|Net| .    To color the icosahedron, such that no two adjacent faces have the same color, requires at least 3 colors.  |dodecahedron|Dodecahedron|  inscribed in the same sphere. The problem was solved by  |Hero|Hero_Of_Alexandria| ,  |Pappus|Pappus_Of_Alexandria| , and  |Fibonacci|Fibonacci| , among others. .  |Apollonius_of_Perga|Apollonius_Of_Perga|  discovered the curious result that the ratio of volumes of these two shapes is the same as the ratio of their surface areas. . Both volumes have formulas involving the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio| , but taken to different powers. . As it turns out, the icosahedron occupies less of the spheres volume than the dodecahedron . Numerical values for the volumes of the inscribed Platonic solids may be found in .            The following construction of the icosahedron avoids tedious computations in the  |number_field|Algebraic_Number_Field|   necessary in more elementary approaches.     The existence of the icosahedron amounts to the existence of six  |equiangular_lines|Equiangular_Lines|  in . Indeed, intersecting such a system of equiangular lines with a Euclidean sphere centered at their common intersection yields the twelve vertices of a regular icosahedron as can easily be checked. Conversely, supposing the existence of a regular icosahedron, lines defined by its six pairs of opposite vertices form an equiangular system.     In order to construct such an equiangular system, we start with this 6  ×  6 square  |matrix|Matrix|  . This implies that A has  |eigenvalues|Eigenvalue,_Eigenvector_And_Eigenspace|  – and , both with multiplicity 3 since A is  |symmetric|Symmetric_Matrix|  and of  |trace|Trace|  zero.     The matrix  induces thus a  |Euclidean_structure|Euclidean_Space|  on the  |quotient_space|Quotient_Space|  , which is  |isomorphic|Isomorphism|  to  since the  |kernel|Kernel|   of  has  |dimension|Dimension|  3. The image under the  |projection|Projection|   of the six coordinate axes v, …, v in  forms thus a system of six equiangular lines in  intersecting pairwise at a common acute angle of arccos  . Orthogonal projection of ±v 1 , …, ±v 6 onto the  |-eigenspace|Eigenvalue,_Eigenvector_And_Eigenspace|  of A yields thus the twelve vertices of the icosahedron.     A second straightforward construction of the icosahedron uses  |representation_theory|Group_Representation|  of the  |alternating_group|Alternating_Group|  A 5 acting by direct  |isometries|Isometry|  on the icosahedron.             The rotational  |symmetry_group|Symmetry_Group|  of the regular icosahedron is  |isomorphic|Isomorphic|  to the  |alternating_group|Alternating_Group|  on five letters. This non- |abelian|Abelian_Group| |simple_group|Simple_Group|  is the only non-trivial  |normal_subgroup|Normal_Subgroup|  of the  |symmetric_group|Symmetric_Group|  on five letters. Since the  |Galois_group|Galois_Group|  of the general  |quintic_equation|Quintic_Equation|  is isomorphic to the symmetric group on five letters, and this normal subgroup is simple and non-abelian, the general quintic equation does not have a solution in radicals. The proof of the  |Abel–Ruffini_theorem|Abel–Ruffini_Theorem|  uses this simple fact, and  |Felix_Klein|Felix_Klein|  wrote a book that made use of the theory of icosahedral symmetries to derive an analytical solution to the general quintic equation, . See  |icosahedral_symmetry:_related_geometries|Icosahedral_Symmetryrelated_Geometries|  for further history, and related symmetries on seven and eleven letters.     The full symmetry group of the icosahedron is known as the  |full_icosahedral_group|Full_Icosahedral_Group| , and is isomorphic to the product of the rotational symmetry group and the group C 2 of size two, which is generated by the reflection through the center of the icosahedron.       The icosahedron has a large number of  |stellations|Stellation| . According to specific rules defined in the book  The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra , 59 stellations were identified for the regular icosahedron. The first form is the icosahedron itself. One is a regular  |Kepler–Poinsot_polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot_Polyhedron| . Three are  |regular_compound_polyhedra|Polyhedral_Compoundregular_Compounds| .             The  |small_stellated_dodecahedron|Small_Stellated_Dodecahedron| ,  |great_dodecahedron|Great_Dodecahedron| , and  |great_icosahedron|Great_Icosahedron|  are three  |facetings|Faceting|  of the regular icosahedron. They share the same  |vertex_arrangement|Vertex_Arrangement| . They all have 30 edges. The regular icosahedron and great dodecahedron share the same  |edge_arrangement|Edge_Arrangement|  but differ in faces , as do the small stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron .          There are distortions of the icosahedron that, while no longer regular, are nevertheless  |vertex-uniform|Vertex-Uniform| . These are  |invariant|Invariant|  under the same  |rotations|Rotation|  as the tetrahedron, and are somewhat analogous to the  |snub_cube|Snub_Cube|  and  |snub_dodecahedron|Snub_Dodecahedron| , including some forms which are  |chiral|Chirality|  and some with T h -symmetry, i.e. have different planes of symmetry from the tetrahedron.     The icosahedron is unique among the  |Platonic_solids|Platonic_Solids|  in possessing a  |dihedral_angle|Dihedral_Angle|  not less than 120°. Its dihedral angle is approximately 138.19°. Thus, just as hexagons have angles not less than 120° and cannot be used as the faces of a convex regular polyhedron because such a construction would not meet the requirement that at least three faces meet at a vertex and leave a positive  |defect|Defect|  for folding in three dimensions, icosahedra cannot be used as the  |cells|Cell|  of a convex regular  |polychoron|Polychoron|  because, similarly, at least three cells must meet at an edge and leave a positive defect for folding in four dimensions . However, when combined with suitable cells having smaller dihedral angles, icosahedra can be used as cells in semi-regular polychora , just as hexagons can be used as faces in semi-regular polyhedra . Finally, non-convex polytopes do not carry the same strict requirements as convex polytopes, and icosahedra are indeed the cells of the  |icosahedral_120-cell|Icosahedral_120-Cell| , one of the ten  |non-convex_regular_polychora|Schläfli–Hess_Polychoron| .     An icosahedron can also be called a  |gyroelongated_pentagonal_bipyramid|Gyroelongated_Dipyramid| . It can be decomposed into a  |gyroelongated_pentagonal_pyramid|Gyroelongated_Pentagonal_Pyramid|  and a  |pentagonal_pyramid|Pentagonal_Pyramid|  or into a  |pentagonal_antiprism|Pentagonal_Antiprism|  and two equal pentagonal pyramids.       :   It can be projected to 3D from the 6D  |6-demicube|6-Demicube|  using the same basis vectors that form the hull of the  |Rhombic_triacontahedron|Rhombic_Triacontahedron|  from the  |6-cube|6-Cube| . Shown here including the inner 20 vertices which are not connected by the 30 outer hull edges of 6D norm length . The inner vertices form a  |dodecahedron|Dodecahedron| .     The 3D projection basis vectors used are:   :u    :v    :w           There are 3  |uniform_colorings|Uniform_Coloring|  of the icosahedron. These colorings can be represented as 11213, 11212, 11111, naming the 5 triangular faces around each vertex by their color.     The icosahedron can be considered a snub tetrahedron, as  |snubification|Snub|  of a regular tetrahedron gives a regular icosahedron having chiral  |tetrahedral_symmetry|Tetrahedral_Symmetry| . It can also be constructed as an alternated truncated octahedron, having  |pyritohedral_symmetry|Pyritohedral_Symmetry| . The pyritohedral symmetry version is sometimes called a  |pseudoicosahedron|Pseudoicosahedron| , and is dual to the  |pyritohedron|Pyritohedron| .                    Many  |virus|Virus| es, e.g.  |herpes_virus|Herpesviridae| , have icosahedral  |shells|Capsid| . C. Michael Hogan. 2010. . eds. S. Draggan and C. Cleveland Viral structures are built of repeated identical  |protein|Protein|  subunits known as  |capsomeres|Capsomere| , and the icosahedron is the easiest shape to assemble using these subunits. A regular polyhedron is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein used over and over again; this saves space in the viral  |genome|Genome| .     Various bacterial organelles with an icosahedral shape were also found.  The icosahedral shell encapsulating enzymes and labile intermediates are built of different types of proteins with  |BMC_domains|Bmc_Domain| .     In 1904,  |Ernst_Haeckel|Ernst_Haeckel|  described a number of species of  |Radiolaria|Radiolaria| , including Circogonia icosahedra, whose skeleton is shaped like a regular icosahedron. A copy of Haeckels illustration for this radiolarian appears in the article on  |regular_polyhedra|Regular_Polyhedra| .       The  |closo|Closo_Cluster| - |carboranes|Carboranes|  are chemical compounds with shape very close to icosahedron.  |Icosahedral|Icosahedral_Twins| |twinning|Crystal_Twinning|  also occurs in crystals, especially  |nanoparticles|Nanoparticle| .     Many  |borides|Crystal_Structure_Of_Boron-Rich_Metal_Borides|  and  |allotropes_of_boron|Allotropes_Of_Boron|  contain boron B 12 icosahedron as a basic structure unit.                  Icosahedral  |dice|Dice|  with twenty sides have been used since ancient times. Cromwell, Peter R. Polyhedra Page 327.     In several  |roleplaying_games|Roleplaying_Game| , such as  Dungeons & Dragons , the twenty-sided die  is commonly used in determining success or failure of an action. This die is in the form of a regular icosahedron. It may be numbered from 0 to 9 twice , but most modern versions are labeled from 1 to 20 .     An icosahedron is the three-dimensional game board for Icosagame, formerly known as the Ico Crystal Game.     An icosahedron is used in the board game  Scattergories  to choose a letter of the alphabet. Six letters are omitted .     In the Nintendo 64 game  Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards , the boss Miracle Matter is a regular icosahedron.     Inside a  |Magic_8-Ball|Magic_8-Ball| , various answers to  |yes–no_questions|Yes–No_Question|  are inscribed on a regular icosahedron.          |R._Buckminster_Fuller|R._Buckminster_Fuller|  and Japanese  |cartographer|Cartographer| |Shoji_Sadao|Shoji_Sadao|   designed a world map in the form of an unfolded icosahedron, called the  |Fuller_projection|Fuller_Projection| , whose maximum  |distortion|Distortionmap_Projections|  is only 2%. The American  |electronic_music|Electronic_Music|  duo  |ODESZA|Odesza|  use a regular icosahedron as their logo.          The  |skeleton|N-Skeleton|  of the icosahedron forms a  |graph|Graph| . It is one of 5  |Platonic_graphs|Platonic_Graph| , each a skeleton of its  |Platonic_solid|Platonic_Solid| .     The high degree of symmetry of the polygon is replicated in the properties of this graph, which is  |distance-transitive|Distance-Transitive_Graph|  and  |symmetric|Symmetric_Graph| . The  |automorphism_group|Graph_Automorphism|  has order 120. The vertices can be  |colored|Graph_Coloring|  with 4 colors, the edges with 5 colors, and the  |diameter|Graph_Diameter|  is 3.      The icosahedral graph is  |Hamiltonian|Hamiltonian_Graph| |planar_graph|Planar_Graph| .               There are 4 related  |Johnson_solids|Johnson_Solid| , including pentagonal faces with a subset of the 12 vertices. The similar  |dissected_regular_icosahedron|Dissected_Regular_Icosahedron|  has 2 adjacent vertices diminished, leaving two trapezoidal faces, and a bifastigium has 2 opposite sets of vertices removed and 4 trapezoidal faces. The pentagonal antiprism is formed by removing two opposite vertices.            The icosahedron can be transformed by a  |truncation|Truncation|  sequence into its  |dual|Dual_Polyhedron| , the dodecahedron:        As a snub tetrahedron, and alternation of a truncated octahedron it also exists in the tetrahedral and octahedral symmetry families:           This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular polyhedra with  |Schläfli_symbols|Schläfli_Symbol|  , continuing into the  |hyperbolic_plane|Hyperbolic_Space| .        The regular icosahedron, seen as a snub tetrahedron, is a member of a sequence of  |snubbed|Snub|  polyhedra and tilings with vertex figure  and  |Coxeter–Dynkin_diagram|Coxeter–Dynkin_Diagram|  . These figures and their duals have  rotational  |symmetry|Orbifold_Notation| , being in the Euclidean plane for n 6, and hyperbolic plane for any higher n. The series can be considered to begin with n 2, with one set of faces degenerated into  |digons|Digon| .               The icosahedron can tessellate hyperbolic space in the  |order-3_icosahedral_honeycomb|Order-3_Icosahedral_Honeycomb| , with 3 icosahedra around each edge, 12 icosahedra around each vertex, with  |Schläfli_symbol|Schläfli_Symbol|  . It is  |one_of_four_regular_tessellations|List_Of_Regular_Polytopestessellations_Of_Hyperbolic_3-Space|  in the hyperbolic 3-space.
