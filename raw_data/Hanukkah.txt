            Hanukkah  is a  |Jewish_festival|Jewish_Holidays|  commemorating the rededication of the  |Second_Temple|Second_Temple|  in  |Jerusalem|Jerusalem|  at the time of the  |Maccabean_Revolt|Maccabean_Revolt|  against the  |Seleucid_Empire|Seleucid_Empire| . It is also known as the Festival of Lights .     Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of  |Kislev|Kislev|  according to the  |Hebrew_calendar|Hebrew_Calendar| , which may occur at any time from late November to late December in the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| . The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a  |candelabrum|Candelabra|  with nine branches, called a  |menorah|Menorah|  . One branch is typically placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the  shamash  . Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shamash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.  Other Hanukkah festivities include playing the game of  |dreidel|Hanukkahdreidel|  and eating oil-based foods, such as  |latkes|Latke|  and  |sufganiyot|Sufganiyot| , and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide  |Chabad|Chabad| |Hasidic|Hasidic_Judaism|  movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.        The name Hanukkah derives from the Hebrew verb  , meaning to dedicate . On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.     Many  |homiletical|Homiletics|  explanations have been given for the name:    The name can be broken down into , rested twenty-fifth , referring to the fact that the Jews ceased fighting on the 25th day of  |Kislev|Kislev| , the day on which the holiday begins.  |Ran|Nissim_Of_Gerona|  Shabbat 9b     is also the Hebrew  |acronym|Acronym|  for   — Eight candles, and the  |halakha|Halakha|  is like the House of Hillel . This is a reference to the disagreement between two rabbinical schools of thought — the  |House_of_Hillel|Hillel_The_Elder|  and the  |House_of_Shammai|Shammai|  — on the proper order in which to light the Hanukkah flames. Shammai opined that eight candles should be lit on the first night, seven on the second night, and so on down to one on the last night . Hillel argued in favor of starting with one candle and lighting an additional one every night, up to eight on the eighth night .  |Jewish_law|Jewish_Law|  adopted the position of Hillel.           In  |Hebrew|Hebrew_Language| , the word Hanukkah is written  or  . It is most commonly  |transliterated|Transliteration|  to English as Hanukkah or . The former spelling , which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the words correct spelling in Hebrew,  is the most common  and the preferred choice of  |Merriam–Webster|Merriam–Webster| ,   Collins English Dictionary , the  Oxford Style Manual , and the style guides of  The New York Times  and  The Guardian .  The sound represented by Ch  is not native to the English language. Its use in transliteration of Hebrew into English is based on influences of Yiddish and German, particularly since transliteration into German tended to be earlier than transliteration into English. See . Furthermore, the letter  ḥeth  , which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew  from in classical Hebrew , and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet. Moreover, the kaf consonant is  |geminate|Geminate|  in classical Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal  can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular  leads to the spelling .         The story of Hanukkah is preserved in the books of the  |First|First_Maccabees|  and  |Second_Maccabees|Second_Maccabees| , which describe in detail the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the  |menorah|Menorah| . These books are not part of the  |canonized|Development_Of_The_Hebrew_Bible_Canon| |Tanakh|Tanakh|  used by modern Jews, though the Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider them part of the Bible.      The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in , though the name of the festival and the miracle of the lights do not appear here. A story similar in character, and obviously older in date, is the one alluded to in  according to which the relighting of the altar fire by  |Nehemiah|Nehemiah|  was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee. The above account in 1 Maccabees 4, as well as  portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths  ; similarly  explains the length of the feast as in the manner of the Feast of Booths .             |Megillat_Taanit|Megillat_Taanit|  contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, On the 25th of is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize but gives no further details.     The  |Mishna|Mishna|  mentions Hanukkah in several places, , , , Megillah  and , , and  but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishnas lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah,  |Rav_Nissim_Gaon|Nissim_Ben_Jacob|  postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it. In his Hakdamah Lemafteach Hatalmud Modern scholar  |Reuvein_Margolies|Reuvein_Margolies|  suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the  |Bar_Kochba_revolt|Bar_Kochba_Revolt| , its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans. Yesod Hamishna Vaarichatah pp. 25–28           The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the  |Talmud|Talmud| , committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.  The  |Talmud|Talmud|  says that after the forces of  |Antiochus_IV|Antiochus_Iv|  had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still  |sealed|Seal|  by the  |High_Priest|Kohen_Gadol| , with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days .      The Talmud presents three options:    The law requires only one light each night per household,   A better practice is to light one light each night for each member of the household   The most preferred practice is to vary the number of lights each night.     Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside ones door, on the opposite side of the  |mezuza|Mezuza| , or in the window closest to the street.  |Rashi|Rashi| , in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p.  46a.            |Megillat_Antiochus|Megillat_Antiochus|   concludes with the following words:          The  |Al_HaNissim|Al_Hanissim|  prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the  |Amidah|Amidah|  prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century. Babylonian Talmud, Berachot 28a Al HaNissim describes the history of the holiday as follows:     :In the days of  |Mattiyahu|Mattathias|  ben Yohanan, high priest, the  |Hasmonean|Hasmoneans|  and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom stood up against Your people Israel, to cause them to forget Your Torah and abandon the ways You desire - You, in Your great mercy, stood up for them in their time of trouble; You fought their fight, You judged their judgment, You took their revenge; You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of the few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the evil into the hands of the righteous, the sinners into the hands of those who engaged in Your Torah; You made yourself a great and holy name in Your world, and for Your people Israel You made great redemption and salvation as this very day. And then Your sons came to the inner chamber of Your house, and cleared Your Temple, and purified Your sanctuary, and lit candles in Your holy courtyards, and established eight days of Hanukkah for thanksgiving and praise to Your holy name.       The Jewish historian  |Titus_Flavius_Josephus|Josephus|  narrates in his book,  |Jewish_Antiquities|Antiquities_Of_The_Jews|  XII, how the victorious  |Judas_Maccabeus|Judas_Maccabeus|  ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by  |Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes|Antiochus_Iv_Epiphanes| .   Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the Festival of Lights :     :Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city  |Bethsura|Beth-Zur| , that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies. , Jewish Antiquities xii. 7, § 7, 323         In the  |New_Testament|New_Testament| ,  |John|Gospel_Of_John|  10:22–23 says, Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and  |Jesus|Jesus|  was in the  |temple|Temple_In_Jerusalem|  courts walking in  |Solomon’s_Colonnade|Solomons_Porch|  . The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as the renewals or the consecrations . This is the first reference to the Feast of Dedication by this name in Jewish literature . The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the  |Septuagint|Septuagint|  to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for consecration or dedication is Hanukkah . The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word Khawdata , which literally means renewal or to make new.                   |Judea|Judea|  was part of the  |Ptolemaic_Kingdom|Ptolemaic_Kingdom|  of Egypt until 200  |BCE|Before_Christ|  when King  |Antiochus_III_the_Great|Antiochus_Iii_The_Great|  of  |Syria|Syria|  defeated King  |Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes|Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes|  of Egypt at the  |Battle_of_Panium|Battle_Of_Panium| . Judea then became part of the  |Seleucid_Empire|Seleucid_Empire|  of Syria.  King  |Antiochus_III_the_Great|Antiochus_Iii_The_Great| , wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to live according to their ancestral customs and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.  However, in 175 BCE,  |Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes|Antiochus_Iv_Epiphanes| , the son of Antiochus III, invaded Judea, at the request of the sons of Tobias.  The  |Tobiads|Tobiads| , who led the  |Hellenizing_Jewish_faction|Hellenistic_Judaism|  in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest  |Onias|Menelaus|  and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates:             When the  |Second_Temple|Second_Temple|  in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped,  |Judaism|Judaism|  was outlawed. In 167 BCE,  |Antiochus|Antiochus_Iv_Epiphanes|  ordered an altar to  |Zeus|Zeus|  erected in the Temple. He banned  |brit_milah|Brit_Milah|  and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.      Antiochuss actions provoked a large-scale  |revolt|Maccabean_Revolt| .  |Mattathias|Mattathias|  , a  |Jewish_priest|Kohen| , and his five sons  |Jochanan|Johanan_Maccabeus| ,  |Simeon|Simon_Maccabaeus| ,  |Eleazar|Eleazar_Maccabeus| ,  |Jonathan|Jonathan_Maccabaeus| , and  |Judah|Judas_Maccabeus|  led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochuss order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the governments behest . Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi . By 166 BCE Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BCE the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.  Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, unadulterated and undefiled pure olive oil with the seal of the  |kohen_gadol|High_Priest|  was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. The story goes that one flask was found with only enough oil to burn for one day, yet it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of  |kosher|Kashrut|  oil for the menorah. An eight-day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.      The version of the story in 1 Maccabees states that an eight-day celebration of songs and sacrifices was proclaimed upon re-dedication of the altar, and makes no specific mention of the miracle of the oil.           Some modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in an internal  |civil_war|Civil_War|  between the  |Maccabean|Maccabean|  Jews and the  |Hellenized|Hellenistic_Judaism|  Jews in Jerusalem.     These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like  |Onias|Onias_Iii|  contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like  |Jason|Jason|  and  |Menelaus|Menelaus| .  In particular, Jasons Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.  Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.      What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the  |Hellenizing_Jews|Hellenistic_Judaism|  in their conflict with the traditionalists.  As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.      The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.  However, given the famous question Rabbi  |Yosef_Karo|Yosef_Karo|  posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days ,  it was clear that he believed it was a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Rabbi Karos  Shulchan Aruch  is a main Code of Jewish Law.               |Antiochus_III|Antiochus_Iii|  oust  |Ptolemy_V|Ptolemy_V_Epiphanes|  from  |Judea|Judea|  and  |Samaria|Samaria| .   175 BCE:  |Antiochus_IV|Antiochus_Iv|  ascends the Seleucid throne.

Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the 8-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the  |daily_prayer_service|List_Of_Jewish_Prayers_And_Blessingshanukkah| , and a section is added to the  |blessing_after_meals|Birkat_Hamazon| .      Hanukkah is not a Sabbath-like holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from  |activities_that_are_forbidden_on_the_Sabbath|39_Categories_Of_Activity_Prohibited_On_Shabbat| , as specified in the  Shulkhan Arukh .  Shulkhan Arukh   Orach Chayim  670:1  Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.   Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and Hanukkah Gelt is often given to children. Fried foods  are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember  |Judith|Judith|  and how she overcame  |Holofernes|Holofernes|  by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith  |cut_off_his_head|Judith_Beheading_Holofernes| .                 Each night throughout the 8 day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced beautification  of the  |mitzvah|Mitzvah| , the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.  Shulkhan Arukh   Orach Chayim  671:2 An extra light called a shamash, meaning attendant or sexton,  is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.     Among  |Ashkenazim|Ashkenazic|  the tendency is for every male member of the household to light a full set of lights each night,   while among  |Sephardim|Sephardic|  the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.      The purpose of the shamash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud, Tractate Shabbat 21b–23a against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from  |Sabbath|Shabbat|  candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shamash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shamash candle first and then use it to light the others.  Shulkhan Arukh   Orach Chayim  673:1 So altogether, including the shamash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 . It is Sephardic custom not to light the shamash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shamash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.      The lights can be candles or oil lamps. Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated , while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special  |candelabrum|Candelabrum|  referred to as either a Chanukiah or a menorah . Many families use an oil lamp for Hanukkah. Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shamash light.      In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the  |public_sphere|Public_Sphere|  from the 1970s when Rabbi  |Menachem_M._Schneerson|Menachem_M._Schneerson|  called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of  |public_menorahs|Public_Menorah| .     Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment .     The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the lighting of the house within , but rather for the illumination of the house without, so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holidays miracle . Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some  |Ashkenazi_Jews|Ashkenazi_Jews|  to have a separate menorah for each family member , whereas most  |Sephardi_Jews|Sephardi_Jews|  light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of  |antisemitic_persecution|Antisemitism|  were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in  |Persia|Iran|  under the rule of the  |Zoroastrians|Zoroastrianism| , or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most  |Hasidic|Hasidic_Judaism|  groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the  mezuzah , so that when one passes through the door s/he is surrounded by the holiness of  mitzvot  .      Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles for they too were involved in the miracle. Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 23a           Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.  The custom of many is to light at sundown, although most Hasidim light later. Many Hasidic  |Rebbes|Rebbes|  light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.      Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on  |Shabbat|Shabbat|  itself, the candles must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual, followed by the  |Shabbat_candles|Shabbat_Candles| . At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before  |Havdalah|Havdalah|  and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.      If for whatever reason one didnt light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets. Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.           Typically two blessings  are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night, the  |shehecheyanu|Shehecheyanu|  blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.  Shulkhan Arukh   Orach Chayim  676:1–2     The blessings are said before or after the candles are lit depending on tradition. On the first night of Hanukkah one light is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.             Transliteration:      Translation: Blessed are You,  our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light            Transliteration:      Translation: Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...     Hanerot Halalu Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:  Shulkhan Arukh   Orach Chayim  676:4          Maoz Tzur    In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn  |Maoz_Tzur|Maoz_Tzur|  is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in  |Jewish_history|Jewish_History| , and praises God for survival despite these tragedies , and a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over  |Rome|Ancient_Rome| .      The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.        After lighting the candles and Maoz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some  |Hasidic|Hasidic_Judaism|  and  |Sephardi|Sephardic_Jews|  Jews recite  |Psalms|Psalms| , such as , , and . In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give  |tzedakah|Tzedakah|  in lieu of presents for themselves.              An addition is made to the hodaah benediction in the  |Amidah|Amidah|  , called  Al HaNissim  .  Shulkhan Arukh   Orach Chayim  682:1 This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.       The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the  Hallel  Psalms  are sung during each morning service and the  Tachanun  penitential prayers are omitted.      The Torah is read every day in the  |shacharit|Shacharit|  morning services in  |synagogue|Synagogue| , on the first day beginning from  , and the last day ending with . Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two,  |Jewish_Sabbaths|Shabbat|  . The weekly  |Torah_portion|Parsha|  for the first Sabbath is almost always  Miketz , telling of  |Josephs|Joseph|  dream and his enslavement in  |Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| . The  Haftarah  reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is  – . When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from  – .     The Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.      The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day.   During the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| |Megillat_Antiochus|Megillat_Antiochus|  was read in the  |Italian|Italian_Rite_Jews|  synagogues on Hanukkah just as the  |Book_of_Esther|Book_Of_Esther|  is read on  |Purim|Purim| . It still forms part of the liturgy of the  |Yemenite_Jews|Yemenite_Jews| .      Zot Hanukkah Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue , Zot Hanukkat Hamizbeach |Kabbalah|Kabbalah|  and  |Hasidism|Hasidic_Judaism| , this day is the final seal of the High Holiday season of  |Yom_Kippur|Yom_Kippur|  and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah , a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.        It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.                 A large number of songs have been written on Hanukkah themes, perhaps more so than for any other Jewish holiday. Some of the best known are  Maoz Tzur  , Latkele Latkele , Hanukkiah Li Yesh ,  Ocho Kandelikas  , Kad Katan , Svivon Sov Sov Sov , Haneirot Halolu , Mi Yimalel and Ner Li, Ner Li . Among the most well known songs in English-speaking countries are  |Dreidel,_Dreidel,_Dreidel|Dreidel,_Dreidel,_Dreidel|   and  |Oh_Chanukah|Oh_Chanukah|  .      Among the Rebbes of the  |Nadvorna|Nadvorna| |Hasidic|Hasidic|  dynasty, it is customary for the Rebbes to play  |violin|Violin|  after the menorah is lit.       |Penina_Moises|Penina_Moise|  Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.             There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil  to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the  |Second_Temples|Second_Temple| |Menorah|Menorah|  alight for eight days.  Traditional foods include  |potato_pancakes|Potato_Pancake| , known as latkes in  |Yiddish|Yiddish_Language| , especially among  |Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi_Jews|  families. Sephardi,  |Polish|History_Of_Jews_In_Poland| , and  |Israeli|Israeli_Jews|  families eat jam-filled  |doughnuts|Doughnut|  ,  |bimuelos|Buñuelos|  and  |sufganiyot|Sufganiyot|  which are  |deep-fried|Deep_Frying|  in oil. Hungarian Jews eat cheese pancakes known as cheese latkes .         Latkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.  Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.  In recent years, downsized, mini sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.      Rabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.  This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of  |Judith|Book_Of_Judith|  during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.  The  |deuterocanonical|Deuterocanonical| |book_of_Judith|Book_Of_Judith|  , which is not part of the  |Tanakh|Tanakh| , records that  |Holofernes|Holofernes| , an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her . When Holofernes soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.  |Mishna_Berurah|Mishna_Berurah|  670:2:10      |Roast_goose|Roast_Goose|  has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.                  After lighting the candles, it is customary to play the  |dreidel|Dreidel| . The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words  , referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the  |Beit_Hamikdash|Temple_In_Jerusalem| . On dreidels sold in Israel, the fourth side is inscribed with the letter  , rendering the acronym  , referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent innovation. Stores in  |Haredi|Haredi_Judaism|  neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand there to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.                |Chanukkah_gelt|Chanukkah_Gelt|   known in Israel by the Hebrew translation dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One  |minhag|Minhag|  favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.  Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the  |Halachic|Halachic|  injunction against handling money on the  |Shabbat|Shabbat| .              The United States has a history of recognizing and celebrating Hanukkah in a number of ways. The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister  |David_Ben-Gurion|David_Ben-Gurion|  presented United States President  |Harry_Truman|Harry_Truman|  with a Hanukkah Menorah. In 1979 president  |Jimmy_Carter|Jimmy_Carter|  took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the  |National_Menorah|National_Menorah|  held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President  |George_H.W._Bush|George_H.W._Bush|  displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President  |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.     The  |United_States_Postal_Service|United_States_Postal_Service|  has released several  |Hanukkah-themed|Hanukkah_Stamps| |postage_stamps|Postage_Stamps| . In 1996 the  |United_States_Postal_Service|United_States_Postal_Service|  issued a 32  |cent|Cent|  Hanukkah  |stamp|Postage_Stamp|  as a  |joint_issue|Joint_Issue|  with  |Israel|Israel| .  In 2004 after 8 years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.      In 2001, President  |George_W._Bush|George_W._Bush|  held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House in conjunction with the candle-lighting ceremony, and since then this ceremony has become an annual tradition attended by Jewish leaders from around the country.  In 2008, George Bush linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.      In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The  |White_House|White_House|  commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President  |Barack_Obama|Barack_Obama|  and First Lady  |Michelle_Obama|Michelle_Obama|  as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. Thats what the Hanukkah story teaches us. Its what our young people can teach us— that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.  Rabbi  |Angela_Warnick_Buchdahl|Angela_Warnick_Buchdahl| , in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed Americas founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.           The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the  |Hebrew_calendar|Hebrew_Calendar| . Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of  |Kislev|Kislev|  and concludes on the 2nd or 3rd day of  |Tevet|Tevet|  . The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming:                     In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of  |Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving|  fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President  |Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham_Lincoln| . The last time was 1899; and due to the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.  This convergence prompted the creation of the  |portmanteau|Portmanteau| |neologism|Neologism| |Thanksgivukkah|Thanksgivukkah| .             Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the  |Hebrew_Bible|Tanakh|  was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.      Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Romes grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, like the CE 135 experience.        With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, however, these themes were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.        In North America especially, Hanukkah gained increased importance with many Jewish families in the latter part of the 20th century, including among large numbers of  |secular_Jews|Secular_Jewish_Culture| , who wanted a Jewish alternative to the  |Christmas|Christmas|  celebrations that often overlap with Hanukkah. Though it was traditional among Ashkenazi Jews to give gelt or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families this has been supplemented with other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy gifts just as their Christmas-celebrating peers do.      While Hanukkah is a relatively minor Jewish holiday, as indicated by the lack of religious restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting the candles, in North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to  |Passover|Passover|  as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.      Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkahs miracle of the oil , emphasizing reflection on  |energy_conservation|Energy_Conservation|  and  |energy_independence|North_American_Energy_Independence| . An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Lifes renewable energy campaign.
