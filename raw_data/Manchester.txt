                  Manchester    is a major city and  |metropolitan_borough|Metropolitan_Borough|  in  |Greater_Manchester|Greater_Manchester| ,  |England|England| , with a population of 534,982 as of 2018 .  It lies within the United Kingdoms  |second-most_populous_urban_area|Greater_Manchester_Built-Up_Area| , with a population of 2.9 million,  and third-most populous  |metropolitan_area|List_Of_Metropolitan_Areas_In_Europe| , with a population of 3.3 million.  It is fringed by the  |Cheshire_Plain|Cheshire_Plain|  to the south, the  |Pennines|Pennines|  to the north and east, and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The  |local_authority|Local_Authority|  for the city is  |Manchester_City_Council|Manchester_City_Council| .     The recorded  |history_of_Manchester|History_Of_Manchester|  began with the civilian settlement associated with the  |Roman|Roman_Britain| |fort|Castra|  of Mamucium or Mancunium, which was established in about AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers  |Medlock|River_Medlock|  and  |Irwell|River_Irwell| . It is  |historically|Historic_Counties_Of_England|  a part of  |Lancashire|Lancashire| , although areas of  |Cheshire|Cheshire|  south of the  |River_Mersey|River_Mersey|  were incorporated in the 20th century. The first to be included,  |Wythenshawe|Wythenshawe| , was added to the city in 1931. Throughout the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages|  Manchester remained a  |manorial|Manorialism| |township|Township| , but began to expand at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century. Manchesters unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in  |textile_manufacture_during_the_Industrial_Revolution|Textile_Manufacture_During_The_Industrial_Revolution| ,  and resulted in it becoming the worlds first industrialised city.  •  •  Manchester achieved city status in 1853. The  |Manchester_Ship_Canal|Manchester_Ship_Canal|  opened in 1894, creating the  |Port_of_Manchester|Port_Of_Manchester|  and directly linking the city to the  |Irish_Sea|Irish_Sea| ,  to the west. Its fortune declined after the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , owing to  |deindustrialisation|Deindustrialisation| , but the  |IRA|Provisional_Ira| |bombing_in_1996|1996_Manchester_Bombing|  led to extensive investment and regeneration.  Following successful redevelopment after the IRA bombing, Manchester was the host city for the  |2002_Commonwealth_Games|2002_Commonwealth_Games| .     Manchester is the third most visited city in the UK, after London and  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh| .  It is notable for its  |architecture|Architecture_Of_Manchester| ,  |culture|Culture_Of_Manchester| ,  |musical_exports|Popular_Music_Of_Manchester| ,  |media_links|Media_In_Manchester| ,  |scientific_and_engineering_output|Science_And_Engineering_In_Manchester| ,  |social_impact|Sociology_Of_Manchester| ,  |sports_clubs|Sport_In_Manchester|  and  |transport_connections|Transport_In_Manchester| .     A city of notable firsts,  |Manchester_Liverpool_Road_railway_station|Manchester_Liverpool_Road_Railway_Station|  was the worlds first inter-city passenger railway station. The city has also excelled in scientific advancement, as it was at The University of Manchester in 1917 that scientist Ernest Rutherford first  |split_the_atom|Ernest_Rutherfordscientific_Research| , in 1948 Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Tootill developed and built the worlds first  |stored-program_computer|Manchester_Baby| , and in 2004 Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov successfully isolated and characterised the first  |graphene|Graphene| .      NameManchester originates from the  |Latin|Latin|  name Mamucium or its variant Mancunio and the citizens are still referred to as Mancunians . These names are generally thought to represent a  |Latinisation|Latinization_Of_Names|  of an original  |Brittonic|Common_Brittonic| |name|Celtic_Placenames| . The generally accepted etymology of this name is that it comes from Brittonic mamm- . The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society, ed. by Victor Watts , under MANCHESTER. However, more recent work suggests that it could come from mamma . Both usages are preserved in  |Insular_Celtic_languages|Insular_Celtic_Languages| , such as mam meaning breast in  |Irish|Irish_Gaelic|  and mother in Welsh.  The  |suffix|Suffix|  -chester is from  |Old_English|Old_English|  ceaster .                     The  |Brigantes|Brigantes|  were the major  |Celtic_tribe|Celtic_Tribes_In_Britain_And_Ireland|  in what is now known as  |Northern_England|Northern_England| ; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which  |Manchester_Cathedral|Manchester_Cathedral|  now stands, opposite the bank  |River_Irwell|River_Irwell| .  Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now  |Salford|Salford,_Greater_Manchester|  and  |Stretford|Stretford| . Following the  |Roman_conquest_of_Britain|Roman_Conquest_Of_Britain|  in the 1st century,  |General_Agricola|Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola|  ordered the construction of a  |fort|Castra|  named  |Mamucium|Mamucium|  in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in  |Deva_Victrix|Deva_Victrix|   and  |Eboracum|Eboracum|   were protected from the Brigantes. Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time.  A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in  |Castlefield|Castlefield| . The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century; its  |civilian_settlement|Vicus|  appears to have been abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century.  After the  |Roman_withdrawal|Roman_Withdrawal_From_Britain|  and  |Saxon_conquest|Saxon_Invasions_Of_Britain| , the focus of settlement shifted to the confluence of the Irwell and  |Irk|River_Irk|  sometime before the  |arrival_of_the_Normans|Norman_Conquest|  after 1066.  Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent  |Harrying_of_the_North|Harrying_Of_The_North| .                   Thomas de la Warre,  |lord_of_the_manor|Lord_Of_The_Manor| , founded and constructed a collegiate church for the  |parish|Manchester|  in 1421. The church is now  |Manchester_Cathedral|Manchester_Cathedral| ; the domestic premises of the college house  |Chethams_School_of_Music|Chethams_School_Of_Music|  and  |Chethams_Library|Chethams_Library| .  The library, which opened in 1653 and is still open to the public today, is the oldest free public reference library in the United Kingdom.      Manchester is mentioned as having a  |market|Market_Town|  in 1282.  Around the 14th century, Manchester received an influx of  |Flemish|Flemish_People|  weavers, sometimes credited as the foundation of the regions textile industry.  Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of  |wool|Wool| lens and  |linen|Linen| , and by about 1540, had expanded to become, in  |John_Lelands|John_Leland|  words, The fairest, best builded, quickest, and most populous town of all Lancashire. The cathedral and Chethams buildings are the only significant survivors of Lelands Manchester.     During the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War|  Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting,  |Cromwell|Oliver_Cromwell|  granted it the right to elect its own  |MP|Members_Of_Parliament| .  |Charles_Worsley|Charles_Worsley| , who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the  |Rule_of_the_Major_Generals|Rule_Of_The_Major_Generals| . He was a diligent  |puritan|Puritan| , turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas; he died in 1656.      Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton  |fustians|Fustian| , but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The  |Bridgewater_Canal|Bridgewater_Canal| , Britains first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at  |Worsley|Worsley|  to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at  |Runcorn|Runcorn|  by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton. Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A  |commodities_exchange|Commodities_Exchange| , opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780,  |Richard_Arkwright|Richard_Arkwright|  began construction of Manchesters first cotton mill. In the early 1800s,  |John_Dalton|John_Dalton|  formulated his atomic theory in Manchester.       Manchesters history is concerned with  |textile_manufacture_during_the_Industrial_Revolution|Textile_Manufacture_During_The_Industrial_Revolution| . The great majority of  |cotton_spinning|Spinning|  took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire, and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing,  and later the worlds largest marketplace for cotton goods.  Manchester was dubbed  |Cottonopolis|Cottonopolis|  and Warehouse City during the  |Victorian_era|Victorian_Era| . In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the term manchester is still used for household linen: sheets, pillow cases, towels, etc.  The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchesters population.     Manchester began expanding at an astonishing rate around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| .    It developed a wide range of industries, so that by 1835 Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world. Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade, but diversified into general manufacture. Similarly, the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes, but expanded into other areas. Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance. Trade, and feeding the growing population, required a large transport and distribution infrastructure: the canal system was extended, and Manchester became one end of the worlds first intercity passenger railway—the  |Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway|Liverpool_And_Manchester_Railway| . Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down. In 1878 the  |GPO|Post_Office|   provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester.      The  |Manchester_Ship_Canal|Manchester_Ship_Canal|  was built between 1888 and 1894, in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey, running   from  |Salford|Salford,_Greater_Manchester|  to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey. This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester. On the canals banks, just outside the borough, the worlds first industrial estate was created at  |Trafford_Park|Trafford_Park| . Large quantities of machinery, including cotton processing plant, were exported around the world.     A centre of capitalism, Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots, as well as calls for greater political recognition by the citys working and non-titled classes. One such gathering ended with the  |Peterloo_Massacre|Peterloo_Massacre|  of 16 August 1819. The economic school of  |Manchester_capitalism|Manchester_Capitalism|  developed there, and Manchester was the centre of the  |Anti-Corn_Law_League|Anti-Corn_Law_League|  from 1838 onward.     Manchester has a notable place in the history of  |Marxism|Marxism|  and left-wing politics; being the subject of  |Friedrich_Engels|Friedrich_Engels|  work  The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 ; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester,  and when  |Karl_Marx|Karl_Marx|  visited Manchester, they met at Chethams Library. The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first  |Trades_Union_Congress|Trades_Union_Congress|  was held in Manchester , from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  and the  |Suffragette|Suffragette|  Movement.      At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking , new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.  • • Manchesters golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings  date from then. The citys cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the  |Hallé_Orchestra|Hallé_Orchestra| . In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a  |county_borough|County_Borough|  with even greater autonomy.          Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian  |Simon_Schama|Simon_Schama|  noted that Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke . An American visitor taken to Manchesters blackspots saw wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments .      The number of  |cotton_mills|Cotton_Mill|  in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853. Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by  |Bolton|Bolton|  in the 1850s and  |Oldham|Oldham|  in the 1860s. However, this period of decline coincided with the rise of the city as the financial centre of the region. Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the worlds cotton was processed in the area. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression_In_The_United_Kingdom|  and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.       Like most of the UK, the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the  |Second_World_War|World_War_Ii| . For example, casting and machining expertise at  |Beyer,_Peacock_and_Companys|Beyer,_Peacock_And_Company|  locomotive works in  |Gorton|Gorton|  was switched to bomb making;  |Dunlops|Dunlop_Rubber|  rubber works in  |Chorlton-on-Medlock|Chorlton-On-Medlock|  made  |barrage_balloons|Barrage_Balloon| ; and just outside the city in  |Trafford_Park|Trafford_Park| , engineers  |Metropolitan-Vickers|Metropolitan-Vickers|  made  |Avro_Manchester|Avro_Manchester|  and  |Avro_Lancaster|Avro_Lancaster|  bombers and  |Ford|Ford_Motor_Company|  built the  |Rolls-Royce_Merlin|Rolls-Royce_Merlin|  engines to power them. Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the  |Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe| , and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non-military targets. The biggest took place during the  |Christmas_Blitz|Manchester_Blitz|  on the nights of 22/23 and 24 December 1940, when an estimated  of high explosives plus over 37,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed, including 165 warehouses, 200 business premises, and 150 offices. 376 were killed and 30,000 houses were damaged.   |Manchester_Cathedral|Manchester_Cathedral|  was among the buildings seriously damaged; its restoration took 20 years.        Cotton processing and trading continued to fall in peacetime, and the exchange closed in 1968. By 1963 the port of Manchester was the UKs third largest,  •  and employed over 3,000 men, but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large  |container|Containerization|  ships. Traffic declined, and the port closed in 1982.  Heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by  |Margaret_Thatchers|Margaret_Thatcher|  government after 1979. Manchester lost 150,000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 1983.        Regeneration began in the late 1980s, with initiatives such as the  |Metrolink|Manchester_Metrolink| , the  |Bridgewater_Concert_Hall|Bridgewater_Hall| , the  |Manchester_Arena|Manchester_Arena| , and the rebranding of the port as  |Salford_Quays|Salford_Quays| . Two bids to host the Olympic Games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city.        Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans, including the  |Manchester_Martyrs|Manchester_Martyrs|  of 1867, arson in 1920, a series of explosions in 1939, and two bombs in 1992.   On Saturday 15 June 1996, the  |Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army|Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army|  carried out the  |1996_Manchester_bombing|1996_Manchester_Bombing| , the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre. The largest to be detonated on British soil, the bomb injured over 200 people, heavily damaged nearby buildings, and broke windows  away. The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £50  million, but this was quickly revised upwards.  The final insurance payout was over £400 million; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade.        Spurred by the investment after the 1996 bomb and aided by the  |XVII_Commonwealth_Games|2002_Commonwealth_Games| , the city centre has undergone extensive regeneration.    New and renovated complexes such as  |The_Printworks|The_Printworks|  and  |Corn_Exchange|Corn_Exchange,_Manchester|  have become popular shopping, eating and entertainment areas.  |Manchester_Arndale|Manchester_Arndale|  is the UKs largest city-centre shopping centre.      Large city sections from the 1960s have been demolished, re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel. Old mills have been converted into apartments.  |Hulme|Hulme|  has undergone extensive regeneration, with million-pound loft-house apartments being developed. The 47-storey,   |Beetham_Tower|Beetham_Tower,_Manchester|  was the tallest UK building outside London and the highest residential accommodation in Europe when completed in 2006. It was surpassed in 2018 by the  South Tower of the  |Deansgate_Square|Deansgate_Square|  project, also in Manchester.  In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel licensed Manchester to build the UKs only  |supercasino|Supercasino| ,  but plans were abandoned in February 2008.      On 22 May 2017, an  |Islamic_terrorist|Islamic_Terrorist|  carried out  |a_bombing|Manchester_Arena_Bombing|  at an  |Ariana_Grande|Ariana_Grande|  concert in the  |Manchester_Arena|Manchester_Arena| . The bomb killed 23, including the attacker, and injured over 800.  It was the deadliest terrorist attack and first suicide bombing in Britain since the  |7_July_2005_London_bombings|7_July_2005_London_Bombings| . It caused  |worldwide_condemnation|Reactions_To_The_Manchester_Arena_Bombing|  and changed the  |UKs_threat_level|Uk_Threat_Levels|  to critical for the first time since 2007.      Since around the turn of the 21st century, Manchester has been regarded as the  |second_city_of_the_United_Kingdom|Second_City_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  by sections of the international press,  British public,  and government ministers.   The BBC reports that redevelopment of recent years has heightened claims that Manchester is the second city of the UK.    Manchester and Birmingham traditionally compete as front runners for this unofficial title.                The City of Manchester is governed by the  |Manchester_City_Council|Manchester_City_Council| . The  |Greater_Manchester_Combined_Authority|Greater_Manchester_Combined_Authority| , with a  |directly_elected_mayor|Mayor_Of_Greater_Manchester| , has responsibilities for economic strategy and transport, amongst other areas, on a Greater Manchester-wide basis. Manchester has been a member of the English  |Core_Cities_Group|Core_Cities_Group|  since its inception in 1995.      The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas Grelley in 1301, but lost its  |borough_status|Borough_Status_In_The_United_Kingdom|  in a court case of 1359. Until the 19th century local government was largely in the hands of  |manorial_courts|Manorial_Court| , the last of which was dissolved in 1846.      From  |a_very_early_time|History_Of_Lancashire| , the  |township_of_Manchester|Manchester_Township|  lay within the  |historic_or_ceremonial_county_boundaries|Historic_Counties_Of_England|  of  |Lancashire|Lancashire| .  |Pevsner|Nikolaus_Pevsner|  wrote That  |Stretford|Stretford|  and  |Salford|Salford,_Greater_Manchester|  are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England . A stroke of a  |Norman|Normans| |barons|Baron|  pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford, though it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester, it was Manchester, with its humbler line of  |lords|Lord| , that was separated from Salford.  It was this separation that resulted in Salford becoming the judicial seat of  |Salfordshire|Salfordshire| , which included the  |ancient_parish_of_Manchester|Manchester| . Manchester later formed its own  |Poor_Law_Union|Poor_Law_Union|  using the name Manchester . In 1792, Commissioners—usually known as Police Commissioners —were established for the social improvement of Manchester. Manchester regained its borough status in 1838, and comprised the townships of  |Beswick|Beswick,_Greater_Manchester| ,  |Cheetham_Hill|Cheetham_Hill| ,  |Chorlton_upon_Medlock|Chorlton_Upon_Medlock|  and  |Hulme|Hulme| . By 1846, with increasing population and greater industrialisation, the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the Police Commissioners . In 1853, Manchester was granted  |city_status_in_the_United_Kingdom|City_Status_In_The_United_Kingdom| .     In 1885,  |Bradford|Bradford,_Greater_Manchester| ,  |Harpurhey|Harpurhey| ,  |Rusholme|Rusholme|  and parts of  |Moss_Side|Moss_Side|  and  |Withington|Withington|  townships became part of the City of Manchester. In 1889, the city became a  |county_borough|County_Borough|  as did many larger Lancashire towns, and therefore not governed by  |Lancashire_County_Council|Lancashire_County_Council| . Between 1890 and 1933, more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council, including former villages such as  |Burnage|Burnage| ,  |Chorlton-cum-Hardy|Chorlton-Cum-Hardy| ,  |Didsbury|Didsbury| ,  |Fallowfield|Fallowfield| ,  |Levenshulme|Levenshulme| ,  |Longsight|Longsight| , and  |Withington|Withington| . In 1931, the  |Cheshire|Cheshire| |civil_parishes|Civil_Parishes_In_England|  of  |Baguley|Baguley| ,  |Northenden|Northenden|  and  |Northen_Etchells|Northen_Etchells|  from the south of the  |River_Mersey|River_Mersey|  were added. In 1974, by way of the  |Local_Government_Act_1972|Local_Government_Act_1972| , the City of Manchester became a  |metropolitan_district|Metropolitan_District|  of the  |metropolitan_county|Metropolitan_County|  of  |Greater_Manchester|Greater_Manchester| . That year,  |Ringway|Ringway,_Greater_Manchester| , the village where the  |Manchester_Airport|Manchester_Airport|  is located, was added to the City.     In November 2014, it was announced that Greater Manchester would receive a  |new_directly_elected_Mayor|Mayor_Of_Greater_Manchester| . The Mayor would have fiscal control over health, transport, housing and police in the area.   |Andy_Burnham|Andy_Burnham|  was elected as the first  |Mayor_of_Greater_Manchester|Mayor_Of_Greater_Manchester|  in  |2017|2017_Greater_Manchester_Mayoral_Election| .             At ,  northwest of London, Manchester lies in a bowl-shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the  |Pennines|Pennines| , an upland chain that runs the length of  |northern_England|Northern_England| , and to the south by the  |Cheshire_Plain|Cheshire_Plain| . Manchester is  north-east of  |Liverpool|Liverpool|  and  north-west of  |Sheffield|Sheffield| , making the city the halfway point between the two. The  |city_centre|Manchester_City_Centre|  is on the east bank of the  |River_Irwell|River_Irwell| , near its confluences with the Rivers  |Medlock|River_Medlock|  and  |Irk|River_Irk| , and is relatively low-lying, being between  above sea level.  The  |River_Mersey|River_Mersey|  flows through the south of Manchester. Much of the inner city, especially in the south, is flat, offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines, which can often be capped with snow in the winter months. Manchesters geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the worlds first industrial city. These features are its climate, its proximity to a  |seaport|Port|  at  |Liverpool|Liverpool| , the availability of water power from its rivers, and its nearby coal reserves.       The name Manchester, though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester, has been applied to other, wider divisions of land, particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area. The Manchester City Zone ,  |Manchester_post_town|M_Postcode_Area|  and the  |Manchester_Congestion_Charge|Manchester_Congestion_Charge|  are all examples of this.     For purposes of the  |Office_for_National_Statistics|Office_For_National_Statistics| , Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the  |Greater_Manchester_Urban_Area|Greater_Manchester_Urban_Area| , the United Kingdoms third-largest conurbation. There is a mix of high-density urban and suburban locations. The largest open space in the city, at around ,  is  |Heaton_Park|Heaton_Park| . Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with  |Cheshire|Cheshire| . The  |M60|M60_Motorway|  and  |M56_motorways|M56_Motorway|  pass through  |Northenden|Northenden|  and  |Wythenshawe|Wythenshawe|  respectively in the south of Manchester. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being  |Manchester_Piccadilly_station|Manchester_Piccadilly_Station| .       Manchester experiences a  |temperate|Temperate| |Oceanic_climate|Oceanic_Climate|  , like much of the British Isles, with mild summers and cool winters. Summer daytime temperatures regularly top 20 Celsius, typically reaching 25 Celsius on sunny days throughout July and August in particular. In more recent years, temperatures have reached over 30 Celsius on occasions. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. The citys average annual rainfall is   compared to a UK average of ,  and its mean rain days are 140.4 per annum, compared to the UK average of 154.4. Manchester has a relatively high humidity level, and this, along with abundant soft water, was one factor that led to advancement of the textile industry in the area.  Snowfalls are not common in the city because of the  |urban_warming|Urban_Climate|  effect but the  |West_Pennine_Moors|West_Pennine_Moors|  to the north-west,  |South_Pennines|South_Pennines|  to the north-east and  |Peak_District|Peak_District|  to the east receive more snow, which can close roads leading out of the city.  They include the  |A62|A62_Road|  via  |Oldham|Oldham|  and  |Standedge|Standedge| ,  the  |A57|A57_Road| ,  |Snake_Pass|Snake_Pass| , towards  |Sheffield|Sheffield| ,  and the  |Pennine_section_of_the_M62|M62_Motorwaymilnrow_To_Outlane| .  The lowest temperature ever recorded in Manchester was  on 7 January 2010.                Manchester lies at the centre of a  |green_belt|Green_Belt|  region extending into the wider surrounding counties. This reduces urban sprawl, prevents towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protects the identity of outlying communities, and preserves nearby countryside.
