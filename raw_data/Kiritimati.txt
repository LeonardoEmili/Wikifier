           Kiritimati or Christmas Island is a Pacific Ocean  |raised_coral_atoll|Raised_Coral_Atoll|  in the northern  |Line_Islands|Line_Islands| . It is part of the  |Republic_of_Kiribati|Kiribati| . Its name is a respelling of the English word Christmas according to the  |Kiribati_languages|Gilbertese_Language|  conventions for the Latin script, in which the combination ti is pronounced s, and the name is thus pronounced .     The island has the greatest land area of any  |coral_atoll|Coral_Atoll|  in the world, about ; its lagoon is roughly the same size. The atoll is about  in perimeter, while the lagoon shoreline extends for over . Kiritimati comprises over 70% of the total land area of Kiribati, a country encompassing 33 Pacific atolls and islands.      It lies  north of the  |Equator|Equator| ,  south of  |Honolulu|Honolulu| , and  from  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco| . Kiritimati Island is in the worlds farthest forward time zone,  |UTC+14|Utc+14| , and is one of the first inhabited places on Earth to experience the New Year . Despite being  east of the 180 meridian, a 1995 realignment of the  |International_Date_Line|International_Date_Line|  by the Republic of Kiribati moved Kiritimati to west of the dateline.      |Nuclear_tests|Nuclear_Test|  were conducted on and around Kiritimati by the United Kingdom in the late 1950s, and by the United States in 1962. During these tests the island was not evacuated. Subsequently, British, New Zealand, and Fijian servicemen as well as local islanders have suffered from exposure to the radiation from these blasts.     The entire island is a  |Wildlife_Sanctuary|Wildlife_Sanctuary| ;  access to five particularly sensitive areas  is restricted.          At Western discovery, Kiritimati was uninhabited. As on other Line Islands there might have been a small or temporary native population, most probably  |Polynesian|Polynesians|  traders and settlers, who would have found the island a useful replenishing station on the long voyages from the  |Society_Islands|Society_Islands|  to Hawaiʻi. This trade route was apparently used with some regularity by about AD 1000. From 1200 onwards Polynesian long-distance voyages became less frequent, and had there been human settlement on Kiritimati, it would have been abandoned in the early-mid  |second_millennium_AD|2Nd_Millennium| . Two possible village sites and some stone structures of these early visitors have been located. Today, most inhabitants are Micronesians, and  |Gilbertese|Gilbertese_Language|  is the only language of any significance. English is generally understood, but little used outside the tourism sector.     Kiritimati was discovered to Europeans by the Spanish expedition of Hernando de Grijalva in 1537, that charted it as Acea.

It was claimed by the United States under the  |Guano_Islands_Act|Guano_Islands_Act|  of 1856,  though little actual mining of  |guano|Guano|  took place.        Permanent settlement started by 1882, mainly by workers in coconut plantations and fishermen but, due to an extreme drought which killed off tens of thousands of coconut palms – about 75% of Kiritimatis population of this plant – the island was once again abandoned between 1905 and 1912.     Many of the  |toponyms|Toponym|  in the island go back to Father Emmanuel Rougier, a French priest who  |lease|Lease| d the island from 1917 to 1939 and planted some 800,000  |coconut|Coconut|  trees there. He lived in his Paris house located at Benson Point, across the Burgle Channel from Londres  at Bridges Point where he established the port. Joes Hill was named by Joe English, who served as plantation manager for Rougier between 1915 and 1919. English was left alone on the island for a year and a half , with two teens, when cholera broke out in  |Papeete|Papeete|  and transport stopped due to the  |First_World_War|First_World_War| . English was later rescued by Lord  |John_Jellicoe,_1st_Earl_Jellicoe|John_Jellicoe,_1St_Earl_Jellicoe| ,  |admiral|Admiral|  of the British Fleet. English, still thinking the war was in effect and that the ship was German, pulled his  |revolver|Revolver|  on the British admiral, causing a short standoff until some explanation defused the situation. Upon his rescue, Englishs adventures were later chronicled in the  Boston Globe . Boston Globe, .     Kiritimati was occupied by the  |Allies|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| ; the Americans took over the island garrison, allowing Australian troops to be used for mainland defense. The first contingent of Americans was a company from the  |102nd_Infantry_Regiment|102Nd_Infantry_Regiment| , a National Guard unit from New Haven, Connecticut. The Island was important to hold because if the Japanese had captured it, an airbase could have been constructed that would have allowed interdiction of the main Hawaii-to-Australia supply route. For the first few months there were next to no recreational facilities on the island, and the men amused themselves by shooting at sharks that swam into the lagoon.     The first  |airstrip|Airstrip|  was constructed then for servicing the  |US_Army_Air_Force|Us_Army_Air_Force| |weather_station|Weather_Station|  and communications center. The airstrip also provided rest and refueling facilities for planes traveling between Hawaii and the South Pacific. There was also a small radio-meteorological research station operated by the Kiribati Meteorological Service.    In 1975 the Captain Cook Hotel was built on the former British military base.     The U.S. Guano Islands Act claim was formally ceded by the  |Treaty_of_Tarawa|Treaty_Of_Tarawa|  between the U.S. and Kiribati, signed in 1979 and ratified in 1983.       During the dispute over the  |Carolines|Caroline_Islands|  between Germany and Spain in 1885, arbitrated by  |Pope_Leo_XIII|Pope_Leo_Xiii| , the  |sovereignty|Sovereignty|  of Spain over the Caroline and  |Palau|Palau|  islands as part of the  |Spanish_East_Indies|Spanish_East_Indies|  was analyzed by a commission of  |cardinals|Cardinal|  and confirmed by an agreement signed on 17 December. Its Article 2 specifies the limits of Spanish sovereignty in South  |Micronesia|Micronesia| , being formed by the Equator and 11°N Latitude and by 133° and by 164° Longitude. In 1899, Spain sold the Marianas, Carolines and Palau to Germany after its defeat in 1898 in the  |Spanish–American_War|Spanish–American_War| . However Emilio Pastor Santos, a researcher of the  |Spanish_National_Research_Council|Spanish_National_Research_Council| , claimed in 1948 that there was historical basis, supported by the charts and maps of the time, to argue that Kiritimati and some other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines. Thus Kiritimati was not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany, and therefore was not affected on the part of Spain to any cessation of transfer and theoretically Spain should have the only jurisdiction and right to this island.     Pastor Santos presented his thesis to the Spanish government in 1948. In the Council of Ministers of Spain on 12 January 1949, the  |Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs|Ministry_Of_Foreign_Affairs_And_Cooperation|  declared on this proposal that it has passed to the first stage of public attention. The Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs circulated the following note:          However, no Spanish government has made any attempt in this respect, and this case remains as a historical curiosity related to Kiritimati.

The United Kingdom UKs Nuclear Deterrent . UK Hansard. 18 July 2016. conducted its first successful  |hydrogen_bomb|Hydrogen_Bomb|  test at  |Malden_Island|Malden_Island|  on 15 May 1957; Kiritimati was the operations main base. In fact,  |this_test_did_not_work_as_planned|Operation_Grapplegrapple| , and  |the_first_British_H-bomb_was_successfully_detonated|Grapple_X|  over the southeastern tip of Kiritimati on 8 November 1957. Subsequent test series in 1958  took place above or near Kiritimati itself. The United States conducted 22 successful nuclear detonations as part of  |Operation_Dominic|Operation_Dominic|  here in 1962. Some toponyms come from the nuclear testing period, during which at times over 4,000 servicemen were present. By 1969, military interest in Kiritimati had ceased and the facilities were abandoned and for the most part dismantled. Some communications, transport and logistics facilities, however, were converted for civilian use and it is due to these installations that Kiritimati came to serve as the administrative center for the Line Islands.     The United Kingdom detonated some  of nuclear payload near and  directly above Kiritimati in 1957/58, while the total yield of weapons tested by the United States in the vicinity of the island between 25 April and 11 July 1962 was . During the British  |Grapple_X|Grapple_X|  test of 8 November 1957 which took place directly above the southeastern tip of Kiritimati,  |yield|Nuclear_Weapon_Yield|  was stronger than expected and there was some blast damage in the settlements. Islanders were usually not evacuated during the  |nuclear_weapons_testing|Nuclear_Weapons_Testing| , and data on the environmental and public health impact of these tests remains contested.       The islands population has strongly increased in recent years, from about 2,000 in 1989 to about 5,000 in the early 2000s. Kiritimati has two representatives in the  |Maneaba_ni_Maungatabu|Maneaba_Ni_Maungatabu| . Today there are five villages, four populated and one abandoned, on the island:          The main villages of Kiritimati are Banana, Tabwakea, and London, which are located along the main road on the northern tip of the island, and Poland, which is across the main lagoon to the South. London is the main village and port facility. Banana is near  |Cassidy_International_Airport|Cassidy_International_Airport|   but may be relocated closer to London to prevent contamination of its groundwater. The abandoned village of Paris is no longer listed in census reports.     The ministry of the Line and Phoenix islands is located in London. There are also two new high schools on the road between Tabwakea and Banana: one  |Catholic|Roman_Catholic_Church|  and one  |Protestant|Protestant| . The  |University_of_Hawaii|University_Of_Hawaii|  has a  |climatological|Climatological|  research facility on Kiritimati. A Catholic church dedicated under the auspices of  |Saint_Stanislaus|Stanislaus_Of_Szczepanów|  and a primary school is located in Poland.        |Cassidy_International_Airport|Cassidy_International_Airport|  is located just north of  |Banana|Banana,_Kiribati|  and North East Point.

American  |Te_Mauri_Travel|Te_Mauri_Travel|  offers weekly charter flights from Honolulu.     Although Air Pacific hoped to commence on 25 May 2010 flying on a weekly schedule to Kiritimati Island from both  |Honolulu|Honolulu|  and  |Fiji|Fiji| , they canceled reservations for those flights explaining that the runway is not suitable.

In the early 1950s,  |Wernher_von_Braun|Wernher_Von_Braun|  proposed using this island as a launch site for manned spacecraft. There is a Japanese  |JAXA|Jaxa|  satellite tracking station; the abandoned Aeon Field had at one time been proposed for reuse by the Japanese for their now-canceled  |HOPE-X|Hope-X|  space shuttle project. Kiritimati is also located fairly close to the  |Sea_Launch|Sea_Launch|  satellite launching spot at 0° N 154° W, about 370 kilometres  to the east in international waters.     Most of the atolls food supplies have to be imported.  |Potable_water|Potable_Water|  can be in short supply, especially around November in  |La_Niña|El_Niño|  years. A large and modern  |jetty|Jetty| , handling some cargo, was built by the Japanese at London. Marine fish provide a large portion of the islands nutrition, although  |overfishing|Overfishing|  has caused a drastic decrease in the populations of large, predatory fish over the last several years.     Exports of the atoll are mainly  |copra|Copra|  ; the state-owned coconut  |plantation|Plantation|  covers about . In addition  |aquarium|Aquarium|  fish and  |seaweed|Seaweed|  are exported. A 1970s project to commercially breed  Artemia salina  brine shrimp in the salt ponds was abandoned in 1978. In recent years there have been attempts to explore the viability of live  |crayfish|Crayfish|  and chilled fish exports and salt production.     Furthermore, there is a small amount of tourism, mainly associated with anglers interested in lagoon fishing  or offshore fishing. Week-long  |ecotourism|Ecotourism|  packages during which some of the normally closed areas can be visited are also available. In recent years, surfers have discovered that there are good waves during the Northern Hemispheres winter season and there are interests developing to service these recreational tourists.  . Surfline.Com . Retrieved on 2013-03-02. There is some tourism-related infrastructure, such as a small hotel, rental facilities, and food services.          Kiritimatis roughly  lagoon opens to the sea in the northwest; Burgle Channel is divided into the northern Cook Island Passage and the southern South Passage. The southeastern part of the lagoon is partially dried out today; essentially, progressing SE from Burgle Channel, the  main lagoon gradually turns into a network of subsidiary lagoons,  |tidal_flats|Tidal_Flat| , partially  |hypersaline|Hypersaline| |brine|Brine|  ponds and  |salt_pans|Salt_Pan| , which as a whole has about the same area again as the main lagoon. Thus, the land and lagoon areas can only be given approximately, as no firm boundary exists between the main island body and the salt flats.  |Vaskess_Bay|Vaskess_Bay|  is a large bay which extends along the southwest coast of Kiritimati Island.     In addition to the main island, there are several smaller ones. Cook Island is part of the atoll proper but unconnected to the Kiritimati mainland. It is a sand/coral island of , divides Burgle Channel into the northern and the southern entrance, and has a large seabird colony. Islets  in the lagoon include Motu Tabu  with its  Pisonia  forest and the shrub-covered Motu Upua  at the northern side, and Ngaontetaake  at the eastern side.     Joes Hill  near Artemia Corners on the southeastern  |peninsula|Peninsula|  is the highest point on the atoll, at about   |ASL|Above_Mean_Sea_Level| . On the northwestern peninsula for example, the land rises only to some 7  m , which is still considerable for an atoll.       Despite its proximity to the  |Intertropical_Convergence_Zone|Intertropical_Convergence_Zone| , Kiritimati is located in an equatorial dry zone and rainfall is rather low except during  |El_Niño|El_Niño|  years;  on average per year, in some years it can be as little as  and much of the flats and ponds can dry up such as in late 1978. On the other hand, in some exceptionally wet years abundant downpours in March–April may result in a total annual precipitation of over . Kiritimati is thus affected by regular, severe droughts. They are exacerbated by its geological structure;  |climatically|Climate|  dry Pacific islands are more typically located in the  |desert|Desert|  belt at about 30°N or S  |latitude|Latitude| . Kiritimati is a raised atoll, and although it does occasionally receive plenty of  |precipitation|Precipitation| , little is retained given the porous  |carbonate_rock|Carbonate_Rock| , the thin  |soil|Soil| , and the absence of dense vegetation cover on much of the island, while  |evaporation|Evaporation|  is constantly high. Consequently, Kiritimati is one of the rather few places close to the  |Equator|Equator|  which have an effectively  |arid|Arid|  climate.     The temperature is constantly between 24  °C and 30  °C with more  |diurnal_temperature_variation|Diurnal_Temperature_Variation|  than seasonal variation. Easterly  |trade_winds|Trade_Winds|  predominate.                The  |flora|Flora|  and the  |fauna|Fauna|  consist of  |taxa|Taxa|  adapted to drought.  |Terrestrial|Terrestrial_Animal|  fauna is scant; there are no truly native land  |mammals|Mammal|  and only one native land bird In the strict sense, i.e. excluding the  |amphibious|Wikt:Special:Search/Amphibious| |eastern_reef_egret|Eastern_Reef_Egret|  – Kiribatis  |endemic|Endemism| |reed-warbler|Acrocephalus| , the  |bokikokiko|Bokikokiko|  . The 1957 attempt to introduce the  |endangered|Endangered_Species| |Rimitara_lorikeet|Rimitara_Lorikeet|   has largely failed; a few birds seem to linger on, but the lack of abundant  |coconut_palm|Coconut_Palm|  forest, on which this tiny parrot depends, makes Kiritimati a suboptimal habitat for this  |species|Species| .            The natural vegetation on Kiritimati consists mostly of low  |shrubland|Shrubland|  and  |grassland|Grassland| . What little woodland exists is mainly open  |coconut_palm|Coconut|   plantation. There are three small woods of catchbird trees , at Southeast Point, Northwest Point, and on Motu Tabu. The latter was planted there in recent times. About 50  |introduced|Introduced_Species|  plant  |species|Species|  are found on Kiritimati; as most are plentiful around settlements, former military sites and roads, it seems that these only became established in the 20th century.        Beach naupaka  is the most common  |shrub|Shrub|  on Kiritimati; beach naupaka scrub dominates the vegetation on much of the island, either as pure stands or interspersed with tree heliotrope  and bay cedar . The latter species is dominant on the drier parts of the lagoon flats where it grows up to  tall. Tree heliotrope is most commonly found a short distance from the sea- or lagoon-shore. In some places near the seashore, a low vegetation dominated by Polynesian heliotrope , yellow purslane  and common purslane  is found. In the south and on the sandier parts,  Sida fallax , also growing up to 2 m tall, is abundant. On the southeastern peninsula, S. fallax grows more stunted, and Polynesian heliotrope, yellow and common purslane as well as the  |spiderling|Boerhavia|   Boerhavia repens , the  |parasitic|Parasitic_Plant| |vine|Vine|   Cassytha filiformis , and Pacific Island thintail  supplement it. The last species dominates in the coastal grasslands. The wetter parts of the lagoon shore are often covered by abundant growth of shoreline purslane .     Perhaps the most destructive of the recently introduced plants is sweetscent , a  |camphorweed|Pluchea| , which is considered an  |invasive_weed|Invasive_Species|  as it overgrows and displaces herbs and grasses. The introduced creeper  Tribulus cistoides , despite having also spread conspicuously, is considered to be more beneficial than harmful to the  |ecosystem|Ecosystem| , as it provides good nesting sites for some  |seabirds|Seabird| .                More than 35 bird  |species|Species|  have been recorded from Kiritimati. As noted above, only the  |bokikokiko|Bokikokiko|  , perhaps a few  |Rimitara_lorikeets|Rimitara_Lorikeet|   – if any remain at all – and the occasional  |eastern_reef_egret|Eastern_Reef_Egret|   make up the entire landbird fauna. About 1,000 adult bokikokikos are to be found at any date, but mainly in mixed grass/shrubland away from the settlements.     On the other hand,  |seabirds|Seabird|  are plentiful on Kiritimati, and make up the bulk of the breeding bird population. There are 18 species of seabirds breeding on the island, and Kiritimati is one of the most important breeding grounds anywhere in the world for several of these:      |Phaethontiformes|Phaethontiformes| |red-tailed_tropicbird|Red-Tailed_Tropicbird|   – important breeding colony; 8,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline, fewer than 3,000 in 1984    |Charadriiformes|Charadriiformes| |black_noddy|Black_Noddy|   – 20,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline    |Little_white_tern|Little_White_Tern|   – 8,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline   Central Pacific  |sooty_tern|Sooty_Tern|   – largest breeding colony in the world; around 7,000,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline    |Spectacled_tern|Spectacled_Tern|   – important breeding colony; 6,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline   Central  |blue-grey_noddy|Blue-Grey_Noddy|   – important breeding colony, possibly the largest worldwide of this subspecies; 4,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline    |Procellariiformes|Procellariiformes| |Polynesian_storm_petrel|Polynesian_Storm_Petrel|   – important breeding colony; 1,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline    |Phoenix_petrel|Phoenix_Petrel|   – largest breeding colony in the world; 24,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline    |Christmas_shearwater|Christmas_Shearwater|   – largest  |subpopulation|Subpopulation|  worldwide on Motu Upua; 12,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline    |Wedge-tailed_shearwater|Wedge-Tailed_Shearwater|   – among the very largest breeding colonies in the world; about 1,000,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline    |Pelecaniformes|Pelecaniformes| |lesser_frigatebird|Lesser_Frigatebird|   – important breeding colony; 9,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline   Central Pacific  |great_frigatebird|Great_Frigatebird|   – important breeding colony; 12,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline, 6,500 afterwards   Austropacific  |masked_booby|Masked_Booby|   – important breeding colony; 3,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline   Indopacific  |red-footed_booby|Red-Footed_Booby|   – 12,000 birds before the 1982/83 decline     Kiritimatis lagoon and the saltflats are a prime location for  |migratory_birds|Migratory_Bird|  to stop over or even stay all winter. The most commonly seen migrants are  |ruddy_turnstone|Ruddy_Turnstone|  ,  |Pacific_golden_plover|Pacific_Golden_Plover|  ,  |bristle-thighed_curlew|Bristle-Thighed_Curlew|   and  |wandering_tattler|Wandering_Tattler|  ; other  |seabirds|Seabird| ,  |waders|Wader|  and even  |dabbling_ducks|Dabbling_Duck|  can be encountered every now and then. Around 7 October , some 20 million sooty shearwaters pass through here en route from the North Pacific feeding grounds to breeding sites around New Zealand.      See also Extinction below .       The only mammals native to the region are the common  |Polynesian_rat|Polynesian_Rat|  , and the goat. Indeed, the rat would seem to have been introduced by native seafarers numerous centuries before Cook found Kiritimati in 1777, and the goat is extinct since 14 January 2004.  |Black_rats|Black_Rat|   were present at some time, perhaps introduced by 19th century sailors or during the nuclear tests. They have not been able to gain a foothold between  |predation|Predation|  by cats and  |competitive_exclusion|Competitive_Exclusion|  by Polynesian rats, and no black rat population is found on Kiritimati today.     Up to 2,000  |feral_cats|Feral_Cat|  can in some years be found on the island; the population became established in the 19th century. Their depredations seriously harm the birdlife. Since the late 19th century, they have driven about 60% of the seabird species from the mainland completely, and during particular dry spells they will cross the mudflats and feast upon the birds on the motus.  |Spectacled_tern|Spectacled_Tern|  chicks seem to be a favorite food of the local cat population. There are some measures being taken to ensure the cat population does not grow. That lowering the cat population by some amount would much benefit Christmas and its inhabitants is generally accepted, but the situation is too complex to simply go and eradicate them outright  – see  |below|Conservation_And_Extinction|  for details. A limited population of  |feral_pigs|Feral_Pigs|  exists. They were once plentiful and wreaked havoc especially on the  Onychoprion  and  |noddies|Anous| .  |Pig_hunting|Boar_Hunting|  by locals has been encouraged, and was highly successful at limiting the pig population to a sustainable level, while providing a source of cheap protein for the islanders.           There are some  |supertramp|Supertramp| |lizards|Lizard|  which have reached the island by their own means. Commonly seen are the  |mourning_gecko|Mourning_Gecko|   and the  |skink|Skink|   Cryptoblepharus boutonii ; the  |four-clawed_gecko|Four-Clawed_Gecko|   is less often encountered.     There are some  |crustaceans|Crustacean|  of note to be found on Kiritimati and in the waters immediately adjacent. The  |amphibious|Wikt:Special:Search/Amphibious| |coconut_crab|Coconut_Crab|   is not as common as for example on  |Teraina|Teraina| .  |Ghost_crabs|Ghost_Crab|  ,  Cardisoma carnifex  and  Geograpsus grayi   |land_crabs|Land_Crab| , the  |strawberry_land_hermit_crab|Strawberry_Land_Hermit_Crab|  , and the introduced brine shrimp  Artemia salina  which populates the saline ponds are also notable.       Overfishing and pollution have impacted on the ocean surrounding the island. In the ocean surrounding uninhabited islands of the Northern Line Islands,  |Sharks|Shark|  comprised 74% of the top predator biomass at  |Kingman_Reef|Kingman_Reef|  and 57% at  |Palmyra_Atoll|Palmyra_Atoll|  , whereas low shark numbers have been observed at  |Tabuaeran|Tabuaeran|  and Kiritimati.       |Green_turtles|Green_Turtle|   regularly nest in small numbers on Kiritimati. The lagoon is famous among sea anglers worldwide for its  |bonefish|Bonefish|  , and has been stocked with  Oreochromis   |tilapia|Tilapia|  to decrease  |overfishing|Overfishing|  of marine species. Though the tilapias thrive in  |brackish_water|Brackish_Water|  of the flats, they will not last long should they escape into the surrounding ocean.      |Giant_Trevally|Giant_Trevally|  are found in large numbers both inside and outside of the lagoon and along the surrounding reefs. Very large specimens of Giant Trevally can be found around these surrounding reefs and they are sought after by many fishermen in addition to Bonefish.          In December 1960, the British colonial authority gazetted Kiritimati as a  |bird_sanctuary|Bird_Sanctuary|  under the Gilbert and Ellice Island Colony Wild Birds Protection Ordinance of 1938. Access to Cook Island, Motu Tabu and Motu Upua was restricted. Kiritimati was declared a  |Wildlife_Sanctuary|Wildlife_Sanctuary|  in May 1975, in accordance with the Wildlife Conservation Ordinance of the then self-governing colony. Ngaontetaake and the  |sooty_tern|Sooty_Tern|  breeding grounds at North West Point also became restricted-access zones. Two years later, active conservation measures got underway.     To a limited extent, permits to enter the restricted areas for purposes like research or small-scale  |ecotourism|Ecotourism|  are given. Kiribatis Wildlife Conservation Unit participates in the Kiritimati Development Committee and the Local Land Planning Board, and there exists an integrated program of wildlife conservation and education.  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  is a major sponsor of conservation efforts on Kiritimati.     Egg collecting for food on a massive scale was frequent in the past but is now outlawed. It is to be noted that the sooty terns for example could sustain occasional collection of effectively all of a seasons eggs , if given sufficient time to recover and if cats are absent. Even egg collecting on a scale that significantly decreases costly food imports thus in theory could be possible, but not until the cat and rat populations have been brought under control.  |Poaching|Poaching|  remains a concern; with the population rising and spreading out on Kiritimati, formerly remote bird colonies became more accessible and especially the  |red-tailed_tropicbirds|Red-Tailed_Tropicbirds|  and the  Sula  are strongly affected by hunting and disturbance. Tropicbirds are mainly poached for their feathers which are used in local arts and handicraft; it would certainly be possible to obtain them from living birds as it was routinely done at the height of the Polynesian civilization.     It may seem that the erstwhile numbers of seabirds may only ever be approached again by the wholesale eradication of the feral cats. While this has been since shown to be feasible, E.g. on remote and rugged  |subantarctic|Subantarctic| |Marion_Island|Marion_Island|  with  land area it is not clear whether even a severe curtailing of the cat population would be desirable. Though it previously was assumed that the small Polynesian rat is of little if any harm for seabirds, even  |house_mice|House_Mouse|  have been shown to eat seabird nestlings. Most nesting birds, in particularly  |Procellariiformes|Procellariiformes| , are now accepted to be jeopardized by Rattus exulans. The Kiritimatis cats are meanwhile very fond of young seabirds; it even seems that their behavior has shifted accordingly, with cats being less  |territorial|Territory|  generally and congregating in numbers at active bird colonies, and generally eschewing rats when seabird chicks are in plenty.     Possession of an unneutered female cat on Kiritimati is illegal, and owners need to prevent their domestic cats from running wild . Nighttime cat hunting has made little effect on the cat population. As noted above, vigorous protecting of active nesting grounds from cats by traps, poison and supplemented by shooting while otherwise leaving them alone to hunt rats may well be the optimal solution.      There is no reliable data on the environmental and public health impact of the nuclear tests conducted on the island in the late 1950s. A 1975 study  claimed that there was negligible radiation hazard; certainly,  |fallout|Nuclear_Fallout|  was successfully minimized. More recently however, a  |Massey_University|Massey_University|  study of  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  found  |chromosomal_translocations|Chromosomal_Translocation|  to be increased about threefold on average in veterans who participated in the tests; most of the relevant data remains classified to date.     The 1982/83 mega- |El_Niño|El_Niño|  devastated seabird populations on Kiritimati. In some species,  |mortality|Mortality_Rate|  rose to 90% and breeding success dropped to zero during that time. In general, El Niño conditions will cause seabird populations to drop, taking several years to recover at the present density of predators.  |Global_warming|Global_Warming|  impact on Kiritimati is thus unpredictable. El Niño events seem to become shorter but more frequent in a warmer climate. Much of the islands infrastructure and habitation, with the notable exception of the airport area, is located to the  |leeward|Leeward|  and thus somewhat protected from storms. A rising sea level does not appear to be particularly problematic; the increasing flooding of the subsidiary lagoons would provide easily observed forewarning, and might even benefit seabird populations by making the motus less accessible to predators. In fact, geological data suggests that Kiritimati has withstood prehistoric sea level changes well. The biggest hazard caused by a changing climate would seem to be more prolonged and/or severe droughts, which could even enforce the islands abandonment as they did in 1905. However, it is not clear how weather patterns would change, and it may be that precipitation increases.       The  |type_specimen|Type_Specimen|  of the  |Tuamotu_sandpiper|Tuamotu_Sandpiper|   was collected on Kiritimati in 1778, probably on 1 or 2 January, during  |Captain_Cooks|Captain_Cook|  visit. The expeditions  |naturalist|Naturalist| |William_Anderson|William_Anderson|  observed the bird, and it was painted by William Ellis . The single specimen was in  |Joseph_Bankss|Joseph_Banks|  collection at the end of the 18th century, but later was lost or destroyed. There is some  |taxonomic|Taxonomy|  dispute regarding the Kiritimati population. As all  Prosobonia  seem to be resident birds unwilling to undertake long-distance migrations, an appropriate treatment would be to consider the extinct population the  |nominate_subspecies|Nominate_Subspecies| , as Prosobonia cancellata cancellata or Kiritimati sandpiper, distinct from the surviving  |Tuamotu_Islands|Tuamotu_Islands|  population more than 2,000  km to the southeast.     It may have been, but probably was not, limited to Kiritimati; while no remains have been found, little fieldwork has been conducted and judging from the Tuamotu sandpipers habits, almost all  |Line_Islands|Line_Islands|  would have offered suitable  |habitat|Habitat| . The Kiritimati population of P. cancellata disappeared in the earlier part of the 19th century or so, almost certainly due to predation by introduced mammals. While Prosobonia generally manage to hold their own against  |Polynesian_rats|Polynesian_Rat| , they are highly vulnerable to the  |black_rat|Black_Rat|  and  |feral_cats|Feral_Cat| . Given the uncertainties surrounding the introduction date and maximum population of the former, the cats seem to be the main culprits in the Kiritimati sandpipers extinction.        Given that the island was apparently settled to some extent in prehistoric times, it may already have lost bird species then. The geological data indicates that Kiritimati is quite old, was never completely underwater in the  |Holocene|Holocene|  at least, and thus it might have once harbored highly distinct wetland birds. The limited overall  |habitat|Habitat|  diversity on Kiritimati nonetheless limits the range of such hypothetical  |taxa|Taxa| , as does  |biogeography|Biogeography|  due to its remote location. At least one, possibly several  Gallirallus  and/or  Porzana   |rails|Rail|  make the most likely candidates, given their former presence in the region and that conditions on Kiritimati would seem well suited. Perhaps a  Todiramphus   |kingfisher|Kingfisher|  was also present; such a bird would probably have belonged to the  |sacred_kingfisher|Sacred_Kingfisher|   group as that species today occurs as a vagrant in  |Micronesia|Micronesia| , and related forms are resident in southeastern  |Polynesia|Polynesia| . These birds would have fallen victim to the  |Polynesian_rat|Polynesian_Rat|  and, in the case of the rails which would have almost certainly been  |flightless|Flightless_Birds| , hunting by natives.
