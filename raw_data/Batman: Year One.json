In addition, Millers pacing would have to be altered because of ongoing series relatively small page counts. ONeil reasoned that Crisis on Infinite Earths had completely remade the DC Universe, so Miller would be able to have the same creative freedom that The Dark Knight Returns provided. He also reassured Miller that he and Mazzucchelli weren’t going to lose anything by serializing it.     Miller has said he kept Kane and Fingers basic story for Year One but expanded it.

The newsprint paper used in Batman was unable to reproduce the bright coloring and visual effects of The Dark Knight Returns, so Mazzucchelli took on Year One with a more grounded and darker approach.       In accordance with Wolfmans plans, ONeil initially saw Year One as the start of the second volume of Batman and expected the first part to be its first issue. However, Miller rejected this idea. He explained: I dont need to slash through continuity with as sharp a blade as I thought. Doing the Dark Knight has shown me theres been enough good material  ...

Two years before the relaunch, Batman had all-time low sales of 75,000 copies per month; Year One sold an average of 193,000 copies an issue, numbers not seen since the early 1970s. Despite this, it did not outsell other books like  Uncanny X-Men , and the collected edition sold well but never matched the sales of The Dark Knight Returns. The story, with its noir-inspired narrative and dirty violence, quickly caught the attention of readers. The  Los Angeles Times  wrote that Year One offered an interesting and entertaining update to the origin of Batman.      Year Ones characterization, particularly that of Batman and Gordon, has been praised. Hilary Goldstein  compared their journey to friendship to the plot of the film  Serpico ; they found that the two characters respective story arcs—with Gordons illustrat the corruption in Gotham and Batmans detailing the transformation from man to myth —offered an exploration of Batmans world like no other.  Glenn Matchett  wrote that, unlike The Dark Knight Returns, Year Ones Batman is more vulnerable and inexperienced, which made the story more memorable.  Nick Roberts  thought the characters seemed believable,  and comics historian Matthew K. Manning called the characterization realistic.     The storys depiction of Gotham and dark tone has also been acclaimed. Journalist James Lovegrove described Year One as a noir-inflected pulp tale of vigilantism and integrity, focused on a good man doing the right thing in a dirty world and noted the brutality of its fight sequences.  Jason Serafino  wrote that by ignoring many of Batmans trademark gadgets and villains, Miller managed to present Batman in a relatable and thrilling way.  Goldstein found every moment memorable, writing Miller does not waste a single panel in presenting a gritty and dark story. Matchett agreed; he offered particular praise for the scenes depicting Batman clashing with the police, calling them the moment Batman began to become a legend.
