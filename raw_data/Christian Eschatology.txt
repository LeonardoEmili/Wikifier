     Christian eschatology is a major branch of study within  |Christian_theology|Christian_Theology|  dealing with the last things.  |Eschatology|Eschatology| , from two Greek words meaning last and study , is the study of end things, whether the end of an individual life, the  |end_of_the_age|End_Time| , the end of the  |world|Worldly|  or the nature of the  |Kingdom_of_God|Kingdom_Of_God| . Broadly speaking, Christian eschatology is the study concerned with the ultimate destiny of the individual soul and the entire created order, based primarily upon biblical texts within the  |Old|Old_Testament|  and  |New_Testament|New_Testament| .     Christian eschatology looks to study and discuss matters such as death and the  |afterlife|Afterlife| ,  |Heaven|Heaven_In_Christianity|  and  |Hell|Christian_Views_On_Hell| , the  |second_coming|Second_Coming|  of Jesus, the  |resurrection_of_the_dead|Resurrection_Of_The_Dead| , the  |rapture|Rapture| , the  |tribulation|Tribulation| ,  |millennialism|Millennialism| , the end of the world, the  |Last_Judgment|Last_Judgment| , and the New Heaven and  |New_Earth|New_Earth|  in the  |world_to_come|World_To_Come| .     Eschatological passages are found in many places in the Bible, both in the  |Old|Old_Testament|  and the  |New_Testaments|New_Testament| . There are also many extrabiblical examples of eschatological prophecies, as well as church traditions.           |Eschatology|Eschatology|  is an ancient branch of study in Christian theology, informed by Biblical texts such as the  |Olivet_discourse|Olivet_Discourse| ,  |The_Sheep_and_the_Goats|The_Sheep_And_The_Goats| , and other discourses of end times by Jesus, with the doctrine of the  |Second_Coming|Second_Coming|  discussed by  |Paul_the_Apostle|Paul_The_Apostle|  , , , , ,  and  |Ignatius_of_Antioch|Ignatius_Of_Antioch|  , For example, Chapter 6 of the Epistle of St Ignatius to the Romans.

Erwin Fahlbusch, Dietrich, “Eschatology,” The Encyclopedia of Christianity , 122.     The growing modern interest in eschatology is tied to developments in Anglophone Christianity.  |Puritans|Puritans|  in the 18th and 19th centuries were particularly interested in a  |postmillennial|Postmillennialism|  hope which surrounded Christian conversion.  This would be contrasted with the growing interest in  |premillennialism|Premillennialism| , advocated by dispensational figures such as  |J_N_Darby|John_Nelson_Darby| .  Both of these strands would have significant influences on the growing interests in eschatology in  |Christian_missions|Christian_Mission|  and in Christianity in  |West_Africa|Christianity_In_Africa|  and  |Asia|Christianity_In_Asia| .   However, in the 20th century, there would be a growing number of German scholars such as  |Jürgen_Moltmann|Jürgen_Moltmann|  and  |Wolfhart_Pannenberg|Wolfhart_Pannenberg|  who would likewise be interested in eschatology.      In the 1800s, a group of Christian theologians inclusive of  |Ellen_G_White|Ellen_G_White| ,  |William_Miller_|William_Miller|  and  |Joseph_Bates_|Joseph_Bates|  began to study eschatological implications revealed in the  |Book_of_Daniel|Book_Of_Daniel|  and the  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation| . Their interpretation of Christian eschatology resulted in the founding of the  |Seventh_day_Adventist_church|Seventh_Day_Adventist_Church| .          The following approaches arose from the study of Christianitys most central eschatological document, the  |Book_of_Revelation|Book_Of_Revelation| , but the principles embodied in them can be applied to all prophecy in the  |Bible|Bible| . They are by no means mutually exclusive and are often combined to form a more complete and coherent interpretation of prophetic passages. Most interpretations fit into one, or a combination, of these approaches. The alternate methods of prophetic interpretation,  |Futurism|Futurism|  and  |Preterism|Preterism|  which came from Jesuit writings, were brought about to oppose the  |Historicism|Historicism|  interpretation which had been used from Biblical times Jesuit scholarship rallied to the Roman cause by providing two plausible alternatives to the historical interpretation of the Protestants. 1. Luis de Alcazar of Seville, Spain, devised what became known as the preterist system of prophetic interpretation. This theory proposed that the Revelation deals with events in the Pagan Roman Empire, that antichrist refers to Nero and that the prophecies were therefore fulfilled long before the time of the medieval church. Alcazars preterist system has never made any impact on the conservative, or evangelical wing of the Protestant movement, although in the last one hundred years it has become popular among Protestant rationalists and liberals. 2. A far more successful attack was taken by Francisco Ribera of Salamanca, Spain. He was the founder of the futurist system of prophetic interpretation. Instead of placing antichrist way in the past as did Alcazar, Ribera argues that antichrist would appear way in the future. About 1590 Ribera published a five hundred page commentary on the Apocalypse, denying the Protestant application of antichrist to the church of Rome. M.L.
