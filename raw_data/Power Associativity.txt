In  |abstract_algebra|Abstract_Algebra| , power associativity is a property of a  |binary_operation|Binary_Operation|  which is a weak form of  |associativity|Associativity| .     An  |algebra|Algebra_Over_A_Field|   is said to be power-associative if the  |subalgebra|Subalgebra|  generated by any element is associative. Concretely, this means that if an element x is performed an operation by itself several times, it doesnt matter in which order the operations are carried out, so for instance x x .     Every  |associative_algebra|Associative_Algebra|  is power-associative, but so are all other  |alternative_algebras|Alternative_Algebra|   and even some non-alternative algebras like the  |sedenions|Sedenion|  and  |Okubo_algebras|Okubo_Algebra| . Any algebra whose elements are  |idempotent|Idempotent|  is also power-associative.      |Exponentiation|Exponentiation|  to the power of any  |positive_integer|Positive_Integer|  can be defined consistently whenever multiplication is power-associative. For example, there is no need to distinguish whether x 3 should be defined as x or as x, since these are equal. Exponentiation to the power of zero can also be defined if the operation has an  |identity_element|Identity_Element| , so the existence of identity elements is useful in power-associative contexts.     Over a field of  |characteristic|Characteristic|  0, an algebra is power-associative if and only if it satisfies and , where z-x is the  |associator|Associator|  .
