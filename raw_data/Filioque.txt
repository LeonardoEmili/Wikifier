            Filioque  is a Latin term added to the original Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed , and which has been the subject of great controversy between  |Eastern|Eastern_Christianity|  and  |Western_Christianity|Western_Christianity| . It is not in the original text of the Creed, attributed to the  |First_Council_of_Constantinople|First_Council_Of_Constantinople|  , the  |second_ecumenical_council|Second_Ecumenical_Council| , which says that the  |Holy_Spirit|Holy_Spirit|  proceeds from the Father , without additions of any kind, such as and the Son or alone .     In the late 6th century, some  |Latin_Church|Latin_Church| es added the words and from the Son  to the description of the procession of the Holy Spirit, in what many Eastern Orthodox Christians have at a later stage argued is a violation of  of the  |Council_of_Ephesus|Council_Of_Ephesus| , since the words were not included in the text by either the  |First_Council_of_Nicaea|First_Council_Of_Nicaea|  or that of Constantinople. For a different view, see e.g.  This was incorporated into the liturgical practice of Rome in 1014, but was rejected by Eastern Christianity.     Whether that term Filioque is included, as well as how it is translated and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the doctrine of the  |Trinity|Trinity| , which is central to the majority of Christian churches. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of  |God_the_Fathers|God_The_Father|  role in the Trinity; for others, denial of what it expresses implies a serious underestimation of the role of  |God_the_Son|God_The_Son|  in the Trinity.     The term has been an ongoing source of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, contributing, in major part, to the  |East–West_Schism|East–West_Schism|  of 1054 and proving to be an obstacle to attempts to reunify the two sides. There have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of  |Maximus_the_Confessor|Maximus_The_Confessor| , who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches. Differences over this doctrine and the question of  |papal_primacy|Primacy_Of_The_Bishop_Of_Rome|  have been and remain primary causes of schism between the Eastern Orthodox and Western churches.       : Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem   qui ex Patre Filioque procedit   Qui cum Patre, et Filio simul adoratur, et cum glorificatur.     In the Nicene Creed it is translated by the English phrase and the Son   : I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,   who proceeds from the Father and the Son,   who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified.       The controversy referring to the term Filioque involves four separate disagreements:   about the term itself   about the orthodoxy of the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, to which the term refers   about the legitimacy of inserting the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed,   about the authority of the Pope to define the orthodoxy of the doctrine or to insert the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. Although the disagreement about the doctrine preceded the disagreement about the insertion into the Creed, the two disagreements became linked to the third when the pope approved insertion of the term into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, in the 11th century. Anthony Siecienski writes that Ultimately what was at stake was not only Gods trinitarian nature, but also the nature of the Church, its teaching authority and the distribution of power among its leaders.       |Hubert_Cunliffe-Jones|Hubert_Cunliffe-Jones|  identifies two opposing Eastern Orthodox opinions about the Filioque, a liberal view and a rigorist view. The liberal view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing to allow for a plurality of theologies . Each side went astray in considering their theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was not so much about conflicting dogmas as it was about different  theologoumena  or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of  |dogma|Dogma| , there is room for diversity in theological approaches.     This view is vehemently opposed by those in Eastern Orthodox Church whom Cunliffe-Jones identifies as holding a rigorist view. According to standard Eastern Orthodox position, as pronounced by  |Photius|Photius| ,  |Mark_of_Ephesus|Mark_Of_Ephesus|  and 20th century Eastern Orthodox theologians such as  |Vladimir_Lossky|Vladimir_Lossky| , the Filioque question hinges on fundamental issues of dogma and cannot be dismissed as simply one of different theologoumena. Many in the rigorist camp consider the Filioque to have resulted in the role of the Holy Spirit being underestimated by the Western Church and thus leading to serious doctrinal error.     In a similar vein, Siecienski comments that, although it was common in the 20th century to view the Filioque as just another weapon in the power struggle between Rome and Constantinople and although this was occasionally the case, for many involved in the dispute, the theological issues outweighed by far the ecclesiological concerns. According to Siecienski, the deeper question was perhaps whether Eastern and Western Christianity had wound up developing differing and ultimately incompatible teachings about the nature of God . Moreover, Siecienski asserts that the question of whether the teachings of East and West were truly incompatible became almost secondary to the fact that, starting around the 8th or 9th century, Christians on both sides of the dispute began to believe that the differences were irreconcilable.     From the view of the West, the Eastern rejection of the Filioque denied the  |consubstantiality|Consubstantiality|  of the Father and the Son and was thus a form of crypto- |Arianism|Arianism| . In the East, the interpolation of the Filioque seemed to many to be an indication that the West was teaching a substantially different faith . Siecienski asserts that, as much as power and authority were central issues in the debate, the strength of emotion rising even to the level of hatred can be ascribed to a belief that the other side had destroyed the purity of the faith and refused to accept the clear teachings of the fathers on the Spirits procession .              It is argued that in the relations between the Persons of the  |Trinity|Trinity|  one Person cannot take or receive  anything from either of the others except by way of procession. Texts such as  , were seen by Fathers of the Church, especially  |Athanasius_of_Alexandria|Athanasius_Of_Alexandria| ,  |Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria|  and  |Epiphanius_of_Salamis|Epiphanius_Of_Salamis|  as grounds for saying that the Spirit proceeds substantially from both the Father and the Son. Other texts that have been used include , , , where the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of the Son , the Spirit of Christ , the Spirit of Jesus Christ , and texts in the  |Gospel_of_John|Gospel_Of_John|  on the sending of the Holy Spirit by Jesus .   states that the river of the Water of Life in Heaven is flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb , which may be interpreted as the Holy Spirit proceeding from both the Father and the Son.     Siecienski asserts that the New Testament does not explicitly address the procession of the Holy Spirit as later theology would understand the doctrine , although there are certain principles established in the New Testament that shaped later Trinitarian theology, and particular texts that both Latins and Greeks exploited to support their respective positions vis-à-vis the Filioque . In contrast,  |Veli-Matti_Kärkkäinen|Veli-Matti_Kärkkäinen|  says that Eastern Orthodox believe that the absence of an explicit mention of the double procession of the Holy Spirit is a strong indication that the Filioque is a theologically erroneous doctrine.               |Basil_of_Caesarea|Basil_Of_Caesarea|  wrote: Through the one Son is joined to the Father . He also said that the natural goodness, inherent holiness, and royal dignity reaches from the Father through the only-begotten  to the Spirit . However, Siecienski comments that there are passages in Basil that are certainly capable of being read as advocating something like the Filioque, but to do so would be to misunderstand the inherently soteriological thrust of his work .      |Gregory_of_Nazianzus|Gregory_Of_Nazianzus|  distinguished the coming forth  of the Spirit from the Father from that of the Son from the Father by saying that the latter is by generation, but that of the Spirit by procession , a matter on which there is no dispute between East and West, as shown also by the Latin Father  |Augustine_of_Hippo|Augustine_Of_Hippo| , who wrote that although biblical exegetes had not adequately discussed the individuality of the Holy Spirit,      |Gregory_of_Nyssa|Gregory_Of_Nyssa|  stated:          |Cyril_of_Alexandria|Cyril_Of_Alexandria|  provides a host of quotations that seemingly speak of the Spirits procession from both the Father and the Son . In these passages he uses the Greek verbs   and  , not the verb , the verb that appears in the Greek text of the Nicene Creed.     Epiphanius of Salamis is stated by Bulgakov to present in his writings a whole series of expressions to the effect that the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son, out of the Father and the Son, from the Father and out of the Son, from Both, from one and the same essence as the Father and the Son, and so on . Bulgakov concludes: The patristic teaching of the fourth century lacks that exclusivity which came to characterize Orthodox theology after Photius under the influence of repulsion from the Filioque doctrine. Although we do not here find the pure Filioque that Catholic theologians find, we also do not find that opposition to the Filioque that became something of an Orthodox or, rather, anti-Catholic dogma.      Regarding the Greek Fathers, whether Cappadocian or Alexandrian, there is, according to Siecienski, no citable basis for the claim historically made by both sides, that they explicitly either supported or denied the later theologies concerning the procession of the Spirit from the Son. However, they did enunciate important principles later invoked in support of one theology or the other. These included the insistence on the unique hypostatic properties of each Divine Person, in particular the Fathers property of being, within the Trinity, the one cause, while they also recognized that the Persons, though distinct, cannot be separated, and that not only the sending of the Spirit to creatures but also the Spirits eternal flowing forth  from the Father within the Trinity is through the Son .         Siecienski remarked that, while the Greek fathers were still striving to find language capable of expressing the mysterious nature of the Sons relationship to the Spirit, Latin theologians, even during Cyrils lifetime, had already found their answer – the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son . The degree to which this teaching was compatible with, or contradictory to, the emerging Greek tradition remains, sixteen centuries later, subject to debate.      Before the creed of 381 became known in the West and even before it was adopted by the First Council of Constantinople, Christian writers in the West, of whom  |Tertullian|Tertullian|  ,  |Jerome|Jerome|  ,  |Ambrose|Ambrose|  and  |Augustine|Augustine|  are representatives, spoke of the Spirit as coming from the Father and the Son, while the expression from the Father through the Son is also found among them.     In the early 3rd century  |Roman_province_of_Africa|Roman_Province_Of_Africa| , Tertullian emphasises that Father, Son and Holy Spirit all share a single divine substance, quality and power, which he conceives of as flowing forth from the Father and being transmitted by the Son to the Spirit. Using the metaphor the root, the shoot, and the fruit; the spring, the river, and the stream; and the sun, the ray, and point of light for the unity with distinction in the Trinity, he adds, The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, ...     In his arguments against  |Arianism|Arianism| ,  |Marius_Victorinus|Marius_Victorinus|  strongly connected the Son and the Spirit.     In the mid-4th century,  |Hilary_of_Poitiers|Hilary_Of_Poitiers| , wrote of the Spirit coming forth from the Father and being sent by the Son ; as being from the Father through the Son ; and as having the Father and the Son as his source ; in another passage, Hilary points to  , and wonders aloud whether to receive from the Son is the same thing as to proceed from the Father .     In the late 4th century,  |Ambrose_of_Milan|Ambrose_Of_Milan|  asserted that the Spirit proceeds from  the Father and the Son , without ever being separated from either.   Ambrose adds, th You, Almighty God, Your Son is the Fount of Life, that is, the Fount of the Holy Spirit. For the Spirit is life ...      None of these writers, however, makes the Spirits mode of origin the object of special reflection; all are concerned, rather, to emphasize the equality of status of all three divine persons as God, and all acknowledge that the Father alone is the source of Gods eternal being.       |Pope_Gregory_I|Pope_Gregory_I| , in Gospel Homily 26, notes that the Son is sent by the Father both in the sense of an eternal generation and a temporal Incarnation. Thus, the Spirit is said to be sent by the Son from the Father both as to an eternal procession and a temporal mission. The sending of the Spirit is that procession by which It proceeds from the Father and the Son.  In his  |Moralia_in_Iob|Commentary_On_Job| , initially composed while he was apocrisarius at the imperial court of Constantinople and later edited while Pope of Rome, Gregory wrote, But the Mediator of God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, in all things has Him both always and continually present. For the same Spirit even in substance is brought forth from Him  And thus, though He abides in the holy Preachers, He is justly said to abide in the Mediator in a special manner, for that in them He abides of grace for a particular object, but in Him He abides substantially for all ends.
