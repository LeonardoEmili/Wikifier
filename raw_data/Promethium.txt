      Promethium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Pm and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  61. All of its  |isotopes|Isotope|  are  |radioactive|Radioactive_Decay| ; it is extremely rare, with only about 500–600 grams naturally occurring in Earths crust at any given time. Promethium is one of only two radioactive elements that are followed in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table|  by elements with stable forms, the other being  |technetium|Technetium| . Chemically, promethium is a  |lanthanide|Lanthanide| . Promethium shows only one stable oxidation state of +3.     In 1902  |Bohuslav_Brauner|Bohuslav_Brauner|  suggested that there was a then-unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements  |neodymium|Neodymium|  and  |samarium|Samarium|  ; this was confirmed in 1914 by  |Henry_Moseley|Henry_Moseley| , who, having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known, found that atomic number 61 was missing. In 1926, two groups claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61; both discoveries were soon proven to be false. In 1938, during a nuclear experiment conducted at  |Ohio_State_University|Ohio_State_University| , a few radioactive nuclides were produced that certainly were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced, and the discovery was not generally recognized. Promethium was first produced and characterized at  |Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|  in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor. The discoverers proposed the name prometheum , derived from  |Prometheus|Prometheus| , the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans, to symbolize both the daring and the possible misuse of mankinds intellect . However, a sample of the metal was made only in 1963.     There are two possible sources for natural promethium: rare  |decays|Radioactive_Decay|  of natural  |europium|Europium| -151 and  |uranium|Uranium|  . Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, which are used in  |luminous_paint|Luminous_Paint| ,  |atomic_batteries|Atomic_Battery|  and thickness-measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235  with  |thermal_neutrons|Thermal_Neutron|  to produce promethium-147 as a  |fission_product|Fission_Product| .           A promethium atom has 61 electrons, arranged in the  |configuration|Electron_Configuration|  & 91; |Xe|Xenon|  & 93;4f 5 6s 2 .  In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons and one of the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The elements atomic radius is the second largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the most notable exception to the general trend of the contraction of lanthanide atoms with the increase of their atomic numbers . Many properties of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, the first three ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and lower than those of samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less than those of neodymium.     Promethium has a  |double_hexagonal_close_packed|Close-Packing_Of_Equal_Spheres|  structure and a hardness of 63  kg/mm 2 . This low-temperature alpha form converts into a beta,  |body-centered_cubic|Cubic_Crystal_System|  phase upon heating to 890  °C.         Promethium belongs to the  |cerium_group|Cerium_Group|  of lanthanides and is chemically very similar to the neighboring elements. Because of its instability, chemical studies of promethium are incomplete. Even though a few compounds have been synthesized, they are not fully studied; in general, they tend to be pink or red in color. . Encyclopædia Britannica Online Treatment of acidic solutions containing Pm 3+ ions with  |ammonia|Ammonia|  results in a gelatinous light-brown sediment of hydroxide, Pm 3 , which is insoluble in water. When dissolved in hydrochloric acid, a water-soluble yellow salt, PmCl 3 , is produced; similarly, when dissolved in nitric acid, a nitrate results, Pm 3 . The latter is also well-soluble; when dried, it forms pink crystals, similar to Nd 3 . The electron configuration for Pm 3+ is 4f 4 , and the color of the ion is pink. The ground state term symbol is 5 I 4 .  The sulfate is slightly soluble, like the other cerium group sulfates. Cell parameters have been calculated for its octahydrate; they lead to conclusion that the density of Pm 2 3 ·8  H 2 O is 2.86  g/cm 3 . The oxalate, Pm 2 3 ·10  H 2 O, has the lowest solubility of all lanthanide oxalates.     Unlike the nitrate, the  |oxide|Promethium_Oxide|  is similar to the corresponding samarium salt and not the neodymium salt. As-synthesized, e.g. by heating the oxalate, it is a white or lavender-colored powder with disordered structure. This powder crystallizes in a cubic lattice upon heating to 600  °C. Further annealing at 800  °C and then at 1750  °C irreversibly transforms it to a  |monoclinic|Monoclinic|  and  |hexagonal|Hexagonal_Crystal_System|  phases, respectively, and the last two phases can be interconverted by adjusting the annealing time and temperature.          Promethium forms only one stable oxidation state, +3, in the form of ions; this is in line with other lanthanides. According to its position in the  |periodic_table|Periodic_Table| , the element cannot be expected to form stable +4 or +2 oxidation states; treating chemical compounds containing Pm 3+ ions with strong oxidizing or reducing agents showed that the ion is not easily oxidized or reduced.               Promethium is the only  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  and one of only two elements among the first 83 that has no stable or long-lived  isotopes. This is a result of a  |rarely_occurring_effect|Isotopes_Of_Technetiumstability_Of_Technetium_Isotopes|  of the  |liquid_drop_model|Liquid_Drop_Model|  and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84. The primary decay products are  |neodymium|Neodymium|  and  |samarium|Samarium|  isotopes . Promethium  |nuclear_isomers|Nuclear_Isomer|  may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable  |praseodymium|Praseodymium| -141.     The most stable isotope of the element is promethium-145, which has a specific activity of  and a half-life of 17.7  years via  |electron_capture|Electron_Capture| . Because it has 84 neutrons , it may emit an  |alpha_particle|Alpha_Particle|  to form praseodymium-141 with 82 neutrons. Thus it is the only promethium isotope with an experimentally observed  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay| . Its  |partial_half-life|Partial_Half-Life|  for alpha decay is about 6.3  years, and the relative probability for a 145 Pm nucleus to decay in this way is 2.8  %. Several other promethium isotopes such as 144 Pm, 146 Pm, and 147 Pm also have a positive energy release for alpha decay; their alpha decays are predicted to occur but have not been observed.     The element also has 18 nuclear isomers, with  |mass_numbers|Mass_Number|  of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 . The most stable of them is promethium-148m, with a half-life of 43.1  days; this is longer than the half-lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes, except for promethium-143 to 147. In fact, promethium-148m has a longer half-life than its ground state, promethium-148.          In 1934,  |Willard_Libby|Willard_Libby|  reported that he had found weak beta activity in pure neodymium, which was attributed to a half-life over 10 12  years. Almost 20 years later, it was claimed that the element occurs in natural neodymium in equilibrium in quantities below 10 −20 grams of promethium per one gram of neodymium. However, these observations were disproved by newer investigations, because for all seven naturally occurring neodymium isotopes, any single beta decays are forbidden by energy conservation.  In particular, careful measurements of atomic masses show that the mass difference 150 Nd- 150 Pm is negative , which absolutely prevents the single beta decay of 150 Nd to 150 Pm.      In 1965  |Olavi_Erämetsä|Olavi_Erämetsä|  separated out traces of 145 Pm from a rare earth concentrate purified from  |apatite|Apatite| , resulting in an upper limit of 10 −21 for the abundance of promethium in nature; this may have been produced by the natural nuclear fission of uranium, or by  |cosmic_ray_spallation|Cosmic_Ray_Spallation|  of 146 Nd.      Both isotopes of natural europium have larger  |mass_excess|Mass_Excess| es than sums of those of their potential alpha daughters plus that of an alpha particle; therefore, they may alpha decay to promethium. Research at  |Laboratori_Nazionali_del_Gran_Sasso|Laboratori_Nazionali_Del_Gran_Sasso|  showed that europium-151 experimentally decays to promethium-147 with the half-life of 5  years. It has been shown that europium is responsible for about 12  grams of promethium in the Earths crust. Alpha decays for europium-153 have not been found yet, and its theoretically calculated half-life is so high that this process will probably not be observed in the near future.     Promethium can also be formed in nature as a product of  |spontaneous_fission|Spontaneous_Fission|  of  |uranium-238|Uranium-238| . Only trace amounts can be found in naturally occurring ores: a sample of  |pitchblende|Pitchblende|  has been found to contain promethium at a concentration of four parts per quintillion  by mass.  Uranium is thus responsible for 560  g of promethium in  |Earths_crust|Earths_Crust| .      Promethium has also been identified in the spectrum of the star  |HR_465|Hr_465|  in  |Andromeda|Andromeda| ; it also has been found in HD 101065  and HD 965.  Because of the short half-life of promethium isotopes, they should be formed near the surface of those stars.            In 1902, Czech chemist  |Bohuslav_Brauner|Bohuslav_Brauner|  found out that the differences in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them.  This prediction was supported in 1914 by  |Henry_Moseley|Henry_Moseley|  who, having discovered that  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.  With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in the natural environment.     The first claim of a discovery was published by Luigi Rolla and Lorenzo Fernandes of  |Florence|Florence| , Italy. After separating a mixture of a few rare earth elements nitrate concentrate from the  |Brazil|Brazil| ian mineral  |monazite|Monazite|  by fractionated crystallization, they yielded a solution containing mostly samarium. This solution gave x-ray spectra attributed to samarium and element 61. In honor of their city, they named element 61 florentium . The results were published in 1926, but the scientists claimed that the experiments were done in 1924.       Also in 1926, a group of scientists from the  |University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana–Champaign|University_Of_Illinois_At_Urbana–Champaign| , Smith Hopkins and Len Yntema published the discovery of element 61. They named it illinium, after the university.    Both of these reported discoveries were shown to be erroneous because the spectrum line that corresponded to element 61 was identical to that of  |didymium|Didymium| ; the lines thought to belong to element 61 turned out to belong to a few impurities .     In 1934,  |Josef_Mattauch|Josef_Mattauch|  finally formulated the  |isobar_rule|Mattauch_Isobar_Rule| . One of the indirect consequences of this rule was that element 61 was unable to form stable isotopes.  From 1938, a nuclear experiment was conducted by H. B. Law et al. at  |Ohio_State_University|Ohio_State_University| . Nuclides were produced in 1941 which were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, and the name cyclonium was proposed, but there was a lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced and the discovery not largely recognized.        Promethium was first produced and characterized at  |Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory|  in 1945 by  |Jacob_A._Marinsky|Jacob_A._Marinsky| ,  |Lawrence_E._Glendenin|Lawrence_E._Glendenin|  and  |Charles_D._Coryell|Charles_D._Coryell|  by separation and analysis of the fission products of  |uranium|Uranium|  fuel irradiated in the  |graphite_reactor|X-10_Graphite_Reactor| ; however, being too busy with military-related research during  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| , they did not announce their discovery until 1947.    The original proposed name was clintonium , after the laboratory where the work was conducted; however, the name prometheum was suggested by Grace Mary Coryell, the wife of one of the discoverers. It is derived from  |Prometheus|Prometheus| , the Titan in  |Greek_mythology|Greek_Mythology|  who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans and symbolizes both the daring and the possible misuse of the mankind intellect .  The spelling was then changed to promethium, as this was in accordance with most other metals.  |Jacob_A._Marinsky|Jacob_A._Marinsky| |Lawrence_E._Glendenin|Lawrence_E._Glendenin| |Charles_D._Coryell|Charles_D._Coryell|        In 1963, promethium fluoride was used to make promethium metal. Provisionally purified from impurities of samarium, neodymium, and americium, it was put into a  |tantalum|Tantalum|  crucible which was located in another tantalum crucible; the outer crucible contained lithium metal . After creating a vacuum, the chemicals were mixed to produce promethium metal:     :PmF 3 + 3  Li → Pm + 3  LiF     The promethium sample produced was used to measure a few of the metals properties, such as its  |melting_point|Melting_Point| .     In 1963, ion-exchange methods were used at ORNL to prepare about ten grams of promethium from nuclear reactor fuel processing wastes.        Today, promethium is still recovered from the byproducts of uranium fission; it can also be produced by bombarding 146 Nd with  |neutrons|Neutron| , turning it into 147 Nd which decays into  |147_Pm|Promethium-147|  through beta decay with a half-life of 11 days.          The production methods for different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given because it is the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with  |thermal_neutrons|Thermal_Neutron|  or by bombarding a  |uranium_carbide|Uranium_Carbide|  target with energetic protons in a particle accelerator.  Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with  |fast_neutrons|Fast_Neutron|  to cause  |fast_fission|Fast_Fission| , which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.      As early as the 1960s, Oak Ridge National Laboratory could produce 650  grams of promethium per year and was the worlds only large-volume synthesis facility.  Gram-scale production of promethium has been discontinued in the U.S. in the early 1980s, but will possibly be resumed after 2010 at the  |High_Flux_Isotope_Reactor|High_Flux_Isotope_Reactor| . Currently, Russia is the only country producing promethium-147 on a relatively large scale.           Most promethium is used only for research purposes, except for promethium-147, which can be found outside laboratories. It is obtained as the oxide or chloride, in milligram quantities. This isotope does not emit  |gamma_rays|Gamma_Rays| , and its radiation has a relatively small penetration depth in matter and a relatively long half-life.     Some signal lights use a  |luminous_paint|Luminous_Paint| , containing a  |phosphor|Phosphor|  that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light.  This isotope does not cause aging of the phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally,  |radium|Radium| -226 was used for the purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and  |tritium|Tritium|  .  Promethium may be favored over tritium for  |nuclear_safety_reasons|Nuclear_Safety| .      In  |atomic_batteries|Atomic_Battery| , the beta particles emitted by promethium-147 are converted into electric current by sandwiching a small promethium source between two semiconductor plates. These batteries have a useful lifetime of about five years.  The first promethium-based battery was assembled in 1964 and generated a few milliwatts of power from a volume of about 2 cubic inches, including shielding .      Promethium is also used to measure the thickness of materials by evaluating the amount of radiation from a promethium source that passes through the sample.   It has possible future uses in portable X-ray sources, and as auxiliary heat or power sources for space probes and satellites  .        The element, like other lanthanides, has no biological role. Promethium-147 can emit gamma rays during its  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| ,  which are dangerous for all lifeforms. Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed.  In general, gloves, footwear covers, safety glasses, and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used.     It is not known what human organs are affected by interaction with promethium; a possible candidate is the  |bone_tissues|Bone_Tissue| . Sealed promethium-147 is not dangerous. However, if the packaging is damaged, then promethium becomes dangerous to the environment and humans. If  |radioactive_contamination|Radioactive_Contamination|  is found, the contaminated area should be washed with water and soap, but, even though promethium mainly affects the skin, the skin should not be abraded. If a promethium leak is found, the area should be identified as hazardous and evacuated, and emergency services must be contacted. No dangers from promethium aside from the radioactivity are known.
