Ostracism  was a procedure under the  |Athenian_democracy|Athenian_Democracy|  in which any  |citizen|Citizen|  could be  |expelled|Exile|  from the  |city-state|City-State|  of  |Athens|Athens|  for ten years. While some instances clearly expressed popular anger at the citizen, ostracism was often used preemptively. It was used as a way of neutralizing someone thought to be a threat to the state or potential  |tyrant|Tyrant| . The word ostracism continues to be used for various cases of social  |shunning|Shunning| .       The name is derived from the  ostraka  , referring to the  |pottery_shards|Sherd|  that were used as voting tokens. Broken pottery, abundant and virtually free, served as a kind of scrap paper .     Each year the Athenians were asked in the  |assembly|Ecclesia|  whether they wished to hold an ostracism. The question was put in the sixth of the  |ten_months_used_for_state_business_under_the_democracy|Attic_Calendarstate_Calendar|  . If they voted yes , then an ostracism would be held two months later. In a section of the  |agora|Agora|  set off and suitably barriered, According to some sources, part of the  |agora|Agora|  was roped-off, according to others it was temporarily immured with wooden planks. citizens gave the name of those they wished to be ostracised to a scribe, as many of them were illiterate, and they then scratched the name on pottery shards, and deposited them in  |urns|Urn| . The presiding officials counted the ostraka submitted and sorted the names into separate piles. The person whose pile contained the most ostraka would be banished, provided that an additional criterion of a  |quorum|Quorum|  was met, about which there are two principal sources:   According to  |Plutarch|Plutarch| ,  Life of Aristides 7.5 the ostracism was considered valid if the total number of votes cast was at least 6000.   According to a fragment of  |Philochorus|Philochorus| ,  See n. 30 the winner of the ostracism must have obtained at least 6000 votes.   Plutarchs evidence for a quorum of 6000, on  |a_priori|A_Priori_And_A_Posteriori|  grounds a necessity for ostracism also per the account of Philochorus, accords with the number required for grants of citizenship in the following century and is generally preferred.         The person nominated had ten days to leave the city. If he attempted to return, the penalty was  |death|Capital_Punishment| . Notably, the property of the man banished was not confiscated and there was no loss of status. After the ten years, he was allowed to return without stigma. It was possible for the assembly to recall an ostracised person ahead of time; before the  |Persian_invasion|Persian_Wars|  of 479 BC, an amnesty was declared under which at least two ostracised leaders— |Pericles|Pericles|  father Xanthippus and  |Aristides|Aristides|  the Just—are known to have returned. Similarly,  |Cimon|Cimon| , ostracised in 461 BC, was recalled during an emergency.  |Plutarch|Plutarch| , .       Ostracism was crucially different from  |Athenian_law|Athenian_Law_Court|  at the time; there was no charge, and no defence could be mounted by the person expelled. The two stages of the procedure ran in the reverse order from that used under almost any trial system—here it is as if a jury are first asked  Do you want to find someone guilty? , and subsequently asked  Whom do you wish to accuse? . Equally out of place in a judicial framework is perhaps the institutions most peculiar feature: that it can take place at most once a year, and only for one person. In this it resembles the Greek  pharmakos  or  |scapegoat|Scapegoat| —though in contrast, pharmakos generally ejected a lowly member of the community.     A further distinction between these two modes is that ostracism was an automatic procedure that required no initiative from any individual, with the vote simply occurring on the wish of the electorate—a diffuse exercise of power. By contrast, an Athenian trial needed the initiative of a particular citizen-prosecutor. While prosecution often led to a counterattack , no such response was possible in the case of ostracism as responsibility lay with the polity as a whole. In contrast to a trial, ostracism generally reduced political tension rather than increased it.     Although ten years of exile would have been difficult for an Athenian to face, it was relatively mild in comparison to the kind of sentences inflicted by courts; when dealing with politicians held to be acting against the interests of the people, Athenian juries could inflict very severe penalties such as death, unpayably large fines, confiscation of property, permanent exile and loss of citizens rights through  |atimia|Atimia| . Further, the elite Athenians who suffered ostracism were rich or noble men who had connections or  |xenoi|Xenos|  in the wider Greek world and who, unlike genuine exiles, were able to access their income in  |Attica|Attica|  from abroad. In  |Plutarch|Plutarch| , following as he does the anti-democratic line common in elite sources, the fact that people might be recalled early appears to be another example of the inconsistency of  |majoritarianism|Majoritarianism|  that was characteristic of Athenian democracy. However, ten years of exile usually resolved whatever had prompted the expulsion. Ostracism was simply a pragmatic measure; the concept of serving out the full sentence did not apply as it was a preventative measure, not a punitive one.     One curious window on the practicalities of ostracism comes from the cache of 190  |ostraka|Ostracon|  discovered dumped in a well next to the  |acropolis|Acropolis,_Athens| . Broneer, Oscar. Excavations on the North Slope of the Acropolis, 1937 . Hesperia, 1938. pp. 228–243. From the handwriting, they appear to have been written by fourteen individuals and bear the name of  |Themistocles|Themistocles| , ostracised before 471 BC and were evidently meant for distribution to voters. This was not necessarily evidence of  |electoral_fraud|Electoral_Fraud|  , but their being dumped in the well may suggest that their creators wished to hide them. If so, these ostraka provide an example of organized groups attempting to influence the outcome of ostracisms. The two-month gap between the first and second phases would have easily allowed for such a campaign.     There is another interpretation, however, according to which these ostraka were prepared beforehand by enterprising businessmen who offered them for sale to citizens who could not easily inscribe the desired names for themselves or who simply wished to save time. See Surikov, pp. 284–294     The two-month gap is a key feature in the institution, much as in  |elections|Election|  under modern  |liberal_democracies|Liberal_Democracy| . It first prevented the candidate for expulsion being chosen out of immediate anger, although an Athenian general such as Cimon would have not wanted to lose a battle the week before such a second vote. Secondly, it opened up a period for discussion , whether informally in daily talk or  |public_speeches|Public_Speaking|  before the Athenian assembly or Athenian courts. endnoteOration In this process a consensus, or rival consensuses, might emerge. Further, in that time of waiting, ordinary Athenian citizens must have felt a certain power over the greatest members of their city; conversely, the most prominent citizens had an incentive to worry how their social inferiors regarded them.       Ostracism was not in use throughout the whole period of Athenian democracy , but only occurred in the fifth century BC. The standard account, found in  |Aristotles|Aristotle| |Constitution_of_the_Athenians|Constitution_Of_The_Athenians|  22.3,  attributes the establishment to  |Cleisthenes|Cleisthenes| , a pivotal reformer in the creation of the democracy. In that case, ostracism would have been in place from around 506 BC. The first victim of the practice, however, was not expelled until 487 BC—nearly 20 years later. Over the course of the next 60 years some 12 or more individuals followed him. The list may not be complete, but there is good reason to believe the Athenians did not feel the need to eject someone in this way every year. The list of known ostracisms runs as follows:     |tyrant|Tyrant| |Peisistratos|Peisistratos| |Megacles|Megacles|  son of  |Hippocrates|Hippocrates| ; Cleisthenes nephew   485  |Kallixenos|Kallixenos|  nephew of  |Cleisthenes|Cleisthenes|  and head of the Alcmaeonids at the time   |Xanthippus|Xanthippus|  son of Ariphron;  |Pericles|Pericles|  father   482  |Aristides|Aristides|  son of Lysimachus   471  |Themistocles|Themistocles|  son of Neocles   461  |Cimon|Cimon|  son of  |Miltiades|Miltiades_The_Younger| |Alcibiades|Alcibiades|  son of Kleinias   457 Menon son of Meneclides   442  |Thucydides|Thucydides|  son of Melesias   440s Callias son of Didymos   440s  |Damon|Damon|  son of Damonides   416  |Hyperbolus|Hyperbolus|  son of Antiphanes     Around 12,000 political ostraka have been excavated in the Athenian agora and in the  |Kerameikos|Kerameikos| .  The second victim, Cleisthenes nephew Megacles, is named by 4647 of these, but for a second undated ostracism not listed above. The known ostracisms seem to fall into three distinct phases: the 480s BC, mid-century 461–443 BC and finally the years 417–415: this matches fairly well with the clustering of known expulsions, although Themistocles before 471 may count as an exception. This suggests that ostracism fell in and out of fashion.  |Mabel_Lang|Mabel_Lang| , . Ostraka |Hyperbolus|Hyperbolus|  in circa 417 BC. There is no sign of its use after the  |Peloponnesian_War|Peloponnesian_War| , when democracy was restored after the  |oligarchic|Oligarchic|  coup of  |the_Thirty|Thirty_Tyrants|  had collapsed in 403 BC. However, while ostracism was not an active feature of the fourth-century version of democracy, it remained; the question was put to the assembly each year, but they did not wish to hold one.       Because ostracism was carried out by thousands of people over many decades of an evolving political situation and culture, it did not serve a single monolithic purpose. Observations can be made about the outcomes, as well as the initial purpose for which it was created.     The first rash of people ostracised in the decade after the defeat of the first  |Persian|Achaemenid_Empire|  invasion at  |Marathon|Marathon,_Greece|  in 490 BC were all related or connected to the  |tyrant|Tyrant| |Peisistratos|Peisistratos| , who had controlled Athens for 36 years up to 527 BC. After his son  |Hippias|Hippias|  was deposed with  |Sparta|Sparta| n help in 510 BC, the family sought refuge with the Persians, and nearly twenty years later Hippias landed with their invasion force at Marathon.  |Tyranny|Tyranny|  and Persian aggression were paired threats facing the new democratic regime at Athens, and ostracism was used against both.     Tyranny and democracy had arisen at Athens out of clashes between regional and factional groups organised around politicians, including Cleisthenes. As a reaction, in many of its features the democracy strove to reduce the role of factions as the focus of citizen loyalties. Ostracism, too, may have been intended to work in the same direction: by temporarily decapitating a faction, it could help to defuse confrontations that threatened the order of the State.     In later decades when the threat of tyranny was remote, ostracism seems to have been used as a way to decide between radically opposed policies. For instance, in 443 BC  |Thucydides,_son_of_Melesias|Thucydides,_Son_Of_Melesias|   was ostracised. He led an  |aristocratic|Aristocracy|  opposition to Athenian  |imperialism|Imperialism|  and in particular to  |Pericles|Pericles|  building program on the acropolis, which was funded by taxes created for the wars against the  |Achaemenid_Empire|Achaemenid_Empire| . By expelling Thucydides the Athenian people sent a clear message about the direction of Athenian policy. Plutarch, –, . Similar but more controversial claims have been made about the ostracism of  |Cimon|Cimon|  in 461 BC.     The motives of individual voting citizens cannot, of course, be known. Many of the surviving ostraka name people otherwise unattested. They may well be just someone the submitter disliked, and voted for in moment of private spite. As such, it may be seen as a secular, civic variant of Athenian  |curse_tablets|Curse_Tablet| , studied in scholarly literature under the Latin name defixiones, where small dolls were wrapped in lead sheets written with curses and then buried, sometimes stuck through with nails for good measure.     In one anecdote about Aristides, known as the Just , who was ostracised in 482, an illiterate citizen, not recognising him, came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostrakon. When Aristides asked why, the man replied it was because he was sick of hearing him being called the Just . Plutarch,  Perhaps merely the sense that someone had become too arrogant or prominent was enough to get someones name onto an ostrakon. Ostracism rituals could have also been an attempt to dissuade people from covertly committing murder or assassination for intolerable or emerging individuals of power so as to create an open arena or outlet for those harboring primal frustrations and urges or political motivations. The solution for murder, in Gregory H. Padowitzs theory, would then be ostracism which would ultimately be beneficial for all parties—the unfortunate individual would live and get a second chance and society would be spared the ugliness of feuds, civil war, political jams and murder.       The last ostracism, that of  |Hyperbolos|Hyperbolos|  in or near 417 BC, is elaborately narrated by Plutarch in three separate lives |Nicias|Nicias|  and  |Alcibiades|Alcibiades| , laying aside their own hostility for a moment, use their combined influence to have him ostracised instead. According to Plutarch, the people then become disgusted with ostracism and abandoned the procedure forever.     In part ostracism lapsed as a procedure at the end of the fifth century because it was replaced by the  graphe paranomon , a regular court action under which a much larger number of politicians might be targeted, instead of just one a year as with ostracism, and with greater severity. But it may already have come to seem like an anachronism as factional alliances organised around important men became increasingly less significant in the later period, and power was more specifically located in the interaction of the individual speaker with the power of the assembly and the courts. The threat to the democratic system in the late fifth century came not from  |tyranny|Tyranny|  but from  |oligarchic|Oligarchy|  coups, threats of which became prominent after two brief seizures of power, in 411 BC by  |the_Four_Hundred|Athenian_Coup_Of_411_Bc|  and in 404 BC by  |the_Thirty|Thirty_Tyrants| , which were not dependent on single powerful individuals. Ostracism was not an effective defence against the oligarchic threat and it was not so used.       Other cities are known to have set up forms of ostracism on the Athenian model, namely  |Megara|Megara| ,  |Miletos|Miletos| ,  |Argos|Argos|  and  |Syracuse,_Sicily|Syracuse,_Sicily| . In the last of these it was referred to as  petalism os, because the names were written on  |olive|Olive|  leaves. Little is known about these institutions. Furthermore,  |pottery_shards|Sherd|  identified as ostraka have been found in  |Chersonesos_Taurica|Chersonesos_Taurica| , leading historians to the conclusion that a similar institution existed there as well, in spite of the silence of the ancient records on that count. see Surikov, pp. 121–122.     A similar modern practice is the  |recall_election|Recall_Election| , in which the electoral body removes its representation from an elected officer.   Unlike under modern voting procedures, the Athenians did not have to adhere to a strict format for the inscribing of ostraka. Many extant ostraka show that it was possible to write expletives, short epigrams or cryptic injunctions beside the name of the candidate without invalidating the vote. see Surikov, pp. 73–80, and references therein. For example:   Kallixenes, son of Aristonimos, the traitor   Archen, lover of foreigners   Agasias, the donkey    |Megacles|Megacles| , the adulterer       The social psychologist  |Kipling_Williams|Kipling_Williams|  has written extensively on ostracism as a modern phenomenon. Williams defines ostracism as any act or acts of ignoring and excluding of an individual or groups by an individual or a group . Williams, K. . Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. p. ix Williams suggests that the most common form of ostracism in a modern context is refusing to communicate with a person. By refusing to communicate with a person, that person is effectively ignored and excluded. Williams, K. .Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. pp. 2–18. The advent of the internet has made ostracism much easier to engage in, and conversely much more difficult to detect, with Williams and others describing this online ostracism as cyberostracism . In email communication, in particular, it is relatively easy for a person or organization to ignore and exclude a specific person, through simply refusing to communicate with the person. Karen Douglas thus describes unanswered emails as constituting a form of cyberostracism, Douglas, K. 2008. Antisocial Communication on Electronic Mail and the Internet. In: A. Konjin, M. Tanis, S. Utz, and S Barnes Mediated Interpersonal Communication. . New York: Routledge. p. 203. and similarly Eric Wesselmann and Kipling Williams describe ignored emails as a form of cyberostracism. Wesselmann, E. and Williams, K. 2013. Ostracism and Stages of Coping. In: C. Dewall Oxford Handbook of Social Exclusion. . Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 21.     Williams and his colleagues have charted responses to ostracism in some five thousand cases, and found two distinctive patterns of response. The first is increased  |group-conformity|Conformity| , in a quest for re-admittance; the second is to become more provocative and hostile to the group,  |seeking_attention|Attention_Seeking|  rather than acceptance. J. Rose, The Literary Churchill p. 233     As it researched as well by many social psychologists, research has demonstrated that being rejected from groups can have profound effects on a person       Research suggests that ostracism is a common reprisal strategy used by organizations in response to  |whistleblowing|Whistleblowing| . Kipling Williams, in a survey on US whistleblowers, found that 100 percent reported post-whistleblowing ostracism. Williams, K. 2001. Ostracism: The Power of Silence. New York: Guilford Press. p. 195. Alexander Brown similarly found that post-whistleblowing ostracism is a common response, and indeed describes ostracism as form of covert reprisal, as it is normally so difficult to identify and investigate. Brown, A. J. 2008. Whistling While They Work. Canberra: ANU Press. p. 129.       Qahr and ashti is a culture-specific Iranian form of personal shunning, most frequently of another family member in  |Iran|Iran| .  While modern Western concepts of ostracism are based upon enforcing conformity within a societally-recognized group, qahr is a private , family-oriented affair of conflict or display of anger  that is never disclosed to the public at large, as to do would be a breach of social etiquette.      In Iran, the husband has the right to show qahr towards his wife, but the wife does not have the right to show qahr towards her husband, Gender Relationships in Iran  as the husbands family rank is that of Head of Household while the wife has a much lower family ranking. Treatise On Rights  She may practice qahr only towards others of equal or lower status.     Qahr is avoidance of a lower-ranking family member who has committed a perceived insult. It is one of several ritualized social customs of Iranian culture.      Gozasht means tolerance, understanding and a desire or willingness to forgive Iran: At War with History, by John Limbert, 1987 pp. 37–38 and is an essential componant of Qahr and Ashti for both psychological needs of  |closure|Closure|  and  |cognition|Need_For_Cognition| , as well as a culturally accepted source for practicing necessary religious requirements of tawbah  Repentance  and dua .
