It was one of the many songs he sent to record companies.  |Kay_Jason|Jason_Kay|  . Emergency On Planet Earth 20th anniversary reissue booklet –  |Sony_Music_Entertainment|Sony_Music_Entertainment|  During this time, Kay wrote  |When_You_Gonna_Learn|When_You_Gonna_Learn|  , a song covering a variety of social issues. When he had it studio recorded, Kay fought with the producers who stripped the song down and produced it based on mainstream trends. With the track restored to his preference, the experience helped Kay to realise his own musical style. Dubbing himself as a funk kid , Kay wanted a proper live band with a proper live sound. The band would be named, Jamiroquai , a portmanteau of the words  |jam|Jam_Session|  and the name of a Native American confederacy, the  |Iroquois|Iroquois| .  He was signed to  |Acid_Jazz_Records|Acid_Jazz_Records|  in 1991 after he sent a demo tape of himself covering a song by  |the_Brand_New_Heavies|The_Brand_New_Heavies| .   Afterwards, he gradually gathered band members, including his friend Wallis Buchanan who played the  |didgeridoo|Didgeridoo| . Kay was encouraged by his manager to enlist keyboardist  |Toby_Smith|Toby_Smith| , but he was not convinced because Smith had a tendency to play these very ravey acid housey chords. After the group performed as support act for the Brand New Heavies, Kay again met Smith, who persuaded Kay to let him join as the groups co-songwriter and keyboardist. Their first collaboration as songwriters was the anti-war song  |Too_Young_to_Die|Too_Young_To_Die|  . During a 2012 interview, the Brand New Heavies denied rumours that Kay was rejected in an audition to become a singer for their band, which led to him forming his own group.        In 1992, Jamiroquai began their career by performing in the British club scene,  and released When You Gonna Learn as their debut single, which charted outside the UK Top 50 chart. It featured Brand New Heavies bassist Andrew Levy, who was replaced by  |Stuart_Zender|Stuart_Zender|  by audition in the following year.

It was described by an  |AllMusic|Allmusic|  reviewer as a psychedelic melange of tight funky rhythms, acid rock intimations, and 70s soul melodies.  The album laid the foundations for an acid-jazz sound that the band would continue to build upon for the next decade and a half , according to a critic for  |BBC_Music|Bbc_Music| . With the album having an ecologically charged concept,  the music video for When You Gonna Learn was banned in America for using footage of a  |Nazi_party|Nazi_Party| .

Kay, Jason . The Return Of The Space Cowboy 20th anniversary reissue booklet – Sony Music Entertainment The group began writing songs for their second album  The Return of the Space Cowboy , but Kay fell into a creative block which was worsened by his increasing drug use,  and the initially complex nature of the album caused Sony to tell the band that none of sounded like singles .

Jamiroquais sound is generally termed as  |acid_jazz|Acid_Jazz| ,  funk,  disco,   soul,  |house|House_Music| ,  and  |R_B|Contemporary_R_B| .   Their sound has been described as having an anything-goes attitude, an approach that leaves the band open to anything .  The group, as well as Jay Kays vocals, have been frequently compared to  |Stevie_Wonder|Stevie_Wonder| .   He however has voiced against being compared to other artists.  Kay is the primary songwriter of Jamiroquai. Despite his lack of ability to play musical instruments, he would sing and scat melodies for his band members to transcribe to their instrumentation. During the 1990s, Jamiroquai incorporated a  |didgeridoo|Didgeridoo|  to their sound. Played by Wallis Buchanan, it was considered as a distinctive element to their earlier musical style.  When asked about how the group maintained their success, Kay responded, By not worrying about staying relevant... Jamiroquai never really fitted into a trendy genre or anything.      For the bands live performances, Kay said that playing live is our forte and that he studio work a bit stiff in comparison. Robert Hillburn of the  Los Angeles Times  wrote that the live band comprised a 10-member musical team, including a deejay and a horn section , and that Kay asserts the confidence and command of a dancer with moves as fluid and surprising as  |Prince|Prince| ’s .  Chauncey Hollingsworth of the  Chicago Tribune  said in a 1995 concert review that his ease in movement and vocal endurance was like a martial artists.  Hillburn additionally praised Kay for establishing a rapport with the audience. Upon the formation of Jamiroquai, the group intended to focus on the use of live instruments within a big band in contrast to computers and synthesisers. In response to criticism towards the group being retro or being funk , songwriter and keyboardist Toby Smith said thats what it sounds like when 10 musicians play live.     Jamiroquais sound is derived from various  |funk|Funk|  influences from the  |1970s|1970Sinmusicr_Bandurban| , and Britain’s mid-80s rare-groove scene .  Kay was influenced by  |Sly_Stone|Sly_Stone| ,  |Gil_Scott_Heron|Gil_Scott_Heron| ,  |Roy_Ayers|Roy_Ayers| , and  |hip_hop|Hip_Hop|  and its culture. A 2003 compilation titled  Late Night Tales: Jamiroquai  under  |Azuli_Records|Azuli_Records| , contains a selection of the bands  |soul|Soul_Music| , funk and disco influences.  In an  |AllMusic|Allmusic|  review for  Dynamite  , the album was described as having a grab bag aesthetic that collects sounds from  |Chic|Chic|  and  |Parliament|Parliament|  as  |Kajagoogoo|Kajagoogoo| , the  |Police|The_Police| , and  |Terry_Callier|Terry_Callier| .  Kay said that the influences for Rock Dust Light Star were  |Rod_Stewart|Rod_Stewart| ,  |Roxy_Music|Roxy_Music| ,  |Pink_Floyd|Pink_Floyd|  and  |the_Rolling_Stones|The_Rolling_Stones|  in their more rock/disco phase.  Kay expressed his desire to maintain a distinctive sound for the group whilst referencing his influences: If you just sample  |Barry_White|Barry_White|  or Sly Stone, that’s one thing; to get their spirit is different.          Jamiroquais lyrics have occasionally dealt with socially idealistic themes.  Emergency on Planet Earth  revolved around environmental awareness, while  The Return of the Space Cowboy  contained themes of homelessness, Native American rights and slavery. The central idea of  Automaton  was according to Kay: the rise of artificial intelligence and technology to forget the more pleasant, simple and eloquent things in life and in our environment including our relationship with one another as human beings.      However, critics accused the band of not staying true to their lyrical values; with arguments that the group focused more on boy-girl seductions and having fun instead of making social and environmental change,  and that Kays interest in sports cars went against their ecological themes. Larkin pp. 1985–1987 Kay said in an interview with  Muzik , that he was initially reluctant to release  Travelling Without Moving  as it adopted a motorcar concept, but added: just because I love to drive a fast car, that doesnt mean I believe in  He additionally stated in 1999 interview that after a while you realise that people wont boogie and dance to          Kay stated that the groups visual aesthetics are important. He assumes creative control over the groups music videos, such as editing, performing his own stunts and ensuring that they good after 10–15 years .  Called icons of the music-video format by Spencer Kornhaber from  The Atlantic ,  the group are especially known for their  |music_video_of_Virtual_Insanity_|Virtual_Insanitymusic_Video| , directed by  |Jonathan_Glazer|Jonathan_Glazer| . In the video, Kay: performed in a room where the floors, walls and furniture all moved simultaneously.      The bands frontman, Jay Kay, has worn various elaborate head-gear.  In a 1993 interview with  Melody Maker , he said that wearing head-gear gives him a spiritual power that the Iroquois called  |orenda|Orenda|  and if isnt really going for it, Ill tug the hat down and come on all militant. The illuminating helmet that appears in the video for  |Automaton|Automaton|  was designed by  |Moritz_Waldemeyer|Moritz_Waldemeyer|  for Kay to control its lights and movements and to portray him as an endangered species .  He additionally wore Native American head-dresses, in which he had been accused of cultural appropriation.             Jamiroquai were a prominent component within the London-based funk/acid-jazz movement of the 1990s. Price III; Kernodle; Maxille pp. 480–481 They were the third best-selling UK act of the decade, after the  |Spice_Girls|Spice_Girls|  and  |Oasis|Oasis| . As of February 2017, the group has sold more than 26 million albums worldwide.  Despite finding popularity in the UK with high-charting albums, in the US, the band faced declining record sales and an inability to keep their cultural relevance.  They sold 4.4 million albums in the UK and had US sales of 2.5 million copies sold as of 2010.  The group has had four albums that reached number 1 in the UK and three albums that entered the  |Billboard_200|Billboard_200|  chart in the US.
