In June 1956, Miller left his first wife, Mary Slattery, whom he married in 1940, and married film star  |Marilyn_Monroe|Marilyn_Monroe| . They had met in 1951, had a brief affair, and remained in contact since. Monroe had just turned 30 when they married; she never had a real family of her own and was eager to join the family of her new husband. Meyers, Jeffrey. The Genius and the Goddess: Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe. University of Illinois Press       Monroe began to reconsider her career and the fact that trying to manage it made her feel helpless. She admitted to Miller, I hate Hollywood. I dont want it anymore. I want to live quietly in the country and just be there when you need me. I cant fight for myself anymore.      She converted to Judaism to express her loyalty and get close to both Miller and his parents , writes biographer Jeffrey Meyers.  Monroe told her close friend,  |Susan_Strasberg|Susan_Strasberg|  Soon after she converted, Egypt banned all of her movies.      Away from Hollywood and the culture of celebrity, Monroes life became more normal; she began cooking, keeping house and giving Miller more attention and affection than he had been used to.  His children, aged twelve and nine, adored her and were reluctant to return to their mother when the weekend was over.  As she was also fond of older people, she got along well with his parents, and the feeling was mutual.      Later that year, Miller was subpoenaed by the  |HUAC|Huac| , and Monroe accompanied him. Çakırtaş, Önder.  International Journal of Language Academy. Volume 1/1 Winter 2013, pp. 13–22. In her personal notes, she wrote about her worries during this period:        Miller began work on writing the screenplay for  The Misfits  in 1960, directed by  |John_Huston|John_Huston|  and starring Monroe. But it was during the filming that Miller and Monroes relationship hit difficulties, and he later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life.  Monroe was taking drugs to help her sleep and more drugs to help her wake up, which caused her to arrive on the set late and then have trouble remembering her lines. Huston was unaware that Miller and Monroe were having problems in their private life. He recalled later, I was impertinent enough to say to Arthur that to allow her to take drugs of any kind was criminal and utterly irresponsible. Shortly after that I realized that she wouldnt listen to Arthur at all; he had no say over her actions. Grobel, Lawrence. The Hustons, Charles Scribners Sons, New York p. 489     Shortly before the films premiere in 1961, Miller and Monroe divorced after their five years of marriage. Nineteen months later, August 4, 1962, Monroe died of a likely drug overdose. Huston, who had also directed her in her first major role in  The Asphalt Jungle  in 1950, and who had seen her rise to stardom, put the blame for her death on her doctors as opposed to the stresses of being a star: The girl was an addict of sleeping pills and she was made so by the God-damn doctors. It had nothing to do with the Hollywood set-up. Badman, Keith.

She had worked as a photographer documenting the production of The Misfits. The first of their two children,  |Rebecca|Rebecca_Miller| , was born September 15, 1962. Their son, Daniel, was born with  |Down_syndrome|Down_Syndrome|  in November 1966. Against his wifes wishes, Miller had him institutionalized, first at a home for infants in New York City, and then at the  |Southbury_Training_School|Southbury_Training_School|  in Connecticut. Though Morath visited Daniel often, Miller never visited him at the school and rarely spoke of him.  Miller and Inge remained together until her death in 2002. Arthur Millers son-in-law, actor  |Daniel_Day-Lewis|Daniel_Day-Lewis| , is said to have visited Daniel frequently, and to have persuaded Arthur Miller to meet with him.      The Crucible |Elia_Kazan|Elia_Kazan|  appeared before the  |House_Un-American_Activities_Committee|House_Un-American_Activities_Committee|  .

Miller and Kazan were close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazans testimony to the HUAC, the pairs friendship ended. After speaking with Kazan about his testimony, Miller traveled to  |Salem,_Massachusetts|Salem,_Massachusetts| , to research the  |witch_trials_of_1692|Salem_Witch_Trials| . He and Kazan did not speak to each other for the next ten years. Kazan later defended his own actions through his film  On the Waterfront , in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.      In The Crucible, Miller likened the situation with the House Un-American Activities Committee to the witch hunt in Salem in 1692. For a frequently cited study of Millers use of the Salem witchcraft episode, see Robert A. Martin, Arthur Millers The Crucible: Background and Sources , reprinted in James J. Martine, ed. Critical Essays on Arthur Miller, G. K. Hall, .  The play opened at the Beck Theatre on Broadway on January 22, 1953. Though widely considered only somewhat successful at the time of its release, today The Crucible is Millers most frequently produced work throughout the world. It was adapted into  |an_opera|The_Crucible|  by  |Robert_Ward|Robert_Ward|  in 1961.          The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after The Crucible opened, denying him a passport to attend the plays London opening in 1954. When Miller applied in 1956 for a routine renewal of his passport, the  |House_Un-American_Activities_Committee|House_Un-American_Activities_Committee|  used this opportunity to  |subpoena|Subpoena|  him to appear before the committee. Before appearing, Miller asked the committee not to ask him to name names, to which the chairman,  |Francis_E._Walter|Francis_E._Walter|  agreed.  When Miller attended the hearing, to which Monroe accompanied him, risking her own career, he gave the committee a detailed account of his political activities.  Reneging on the chairmans promise, the committee demanded the names of friends and colleagues who had participated in similar activities. Miller refused to comply, saying I could not use the name of another person and bring trouble on him. As a result, a judge found Miller guilty of  |contempt_of_Congress|Contempt_Of_Congress|  in May 1957. Miller was sentenced to a fine and a prison sentence,  |blacklisted|Hollywood_Blacklist| , and disallowed a US passport.  In 1958, his conviction was overturned by the court of appeals, which ruled that Miller had been misled by the chairman of the HUAC.      Millers experience with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s, he joined the other celebrities  who were brought together by the journalist Joan Barthel whose coverage of the highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case helped raise bail for Gibbons son Peter Reilly whod been convicted of his mothers murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. Barthel, Joan:A Death in Canaan. New York: E.P. Dutton. 1976 Barthel documented the case in her book A Death in Canaan which was made as a television film of the same name and broadcast in 1978.  A Death in Canaan    City Confidential , an  |A_&_E_Network|A_&_E_Network|  series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.                  In 1964,  After the Fall  was produced, and is said to be a deeply personal view of Millers experiences during his marriage to Monroe. The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. After the Fall opened on January 23, 1964, at the ANTA Theatre in  |Washington_Square_Park|Washington_Square_Park|  amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called Maggie, on stage. Robert Brustein, in a review in the New Republic, called After the Fall a three and one half hour breach of taste, a confessional autobiography of embarrassing explicitness ... there is a misogynistic strain in the play which the author does not seem to recognize. ... He has created a shameless piece of tabloid gossip, an act of exhibitionism which makes us all voyeurs, ... a wretched piece of dramatic writing. . The Weekly Standard .

In 1965, Miller was elected the first American president of  |PEN_International|Pen_International| , a position which he held for four years.  A year later, Miller organized the 1966 PEN congress in New York City. Miller also wrote the penetrating family drama,  The Price , produced in 1968. It was Millers most successful play since Death of a Salesman.      In 1969, Millers works were banned in the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  after he campaigned for the freedom of dissident writers. Throughout the 1970s, Miller spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as Fame and The Reason Why, and traveling with his wife, producing In The Country and Chinese Encounters with her. Both his 1972 comedy  The Creation of the World and Other Business  and its musical adaptation,  Up from Paradise , were critical and commercial failures.            Miller was an unusually articulate commentator on his own work. In 1978 he published a collection of his Theater Essays, edited by Robert A. Martin and with a foreword by Miller. Highlights of the collection included Millers introduction to his Collected Plays, his reflections on the theory of tragedy, comments on the McCarthy Era, and pieces arguing for a publicly supported theater. Reviewing this collection in the Chicago Tribune,  |Studs_Terkel|Studs_Terkel|  remarked, in reading the Theater Essays...you are exhilaratingly aware of a social critic, as well as a playwright, who knows what hes talking about. Martin, Robert A. ed., The Theater Essays of Arthur Miller. Viking, .     In 1983, Miller traveled to China to produce and direct Death of a Salesman at the Peoples Art Theatre in Beijing.

Martin, Robert A. , The theater essays of Arthur Miller , foreword by Arthur Miller. NY: Viking Press, 1978          Miller successfully synthesized diverse dramatic styles and movements in the belief that a play should embody a delicate balance between the individual and society, between the singular personality and the polity, and between the separate and collective elements of life. He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in American society and often questioned psychological causes of behavior. He also built on the  |realist_tradition|Realist_Theater|  of  |Henrik_Ibsen|Henrik_Ibsen|  in his exploration of the individuals conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from  |Bertolt_Brecht|Bertolt_Brecht|  and others. Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work. Rollyson, Carl; Price, Victoria, Author Biography, Critical Survey of Drama, Second Revised Edition, April 2003, pp. 1–12 Miller often stressed that society made his characters what they are and how it dictated all of their fears and choices. McCormack, Thomas, Arthur Millers Manifesto , The American Scholar, Vol. 74, No. 3, p. 143           While Miller comes under criticism for his reputation, most critics note him as a dramatist of the family. One of his greatest strengths is his penetrating insight into  |familial_relationships|Familial_Relationships| . Carson, Neil, Contemporary Literary Criticism. Ed. Jean C. Stine and Bridget Broderick. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale, 1983. From Literature Resource Center Often, Millers characters are living in service of their family. The conventions of the family play, such as patterns, setting, and style of representation were set canonically by  |Eugene_ONeill|Eugene_Oneill| ,  |Tennessee_Williams|Tennessee_Williams| , and Miller. In these plays, white men are privileged with their family and social responsibility; typically, these men are lower class. Miller maintained that family relationships and families must be immersed in social context. Lenke Németh,   Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies , Arthur Millers The Ride Down Mount Morgan and the Family-Play Tradition , Vol. 11, No. 2, Representations of the Family in Modern English-Language Drama In Memory of Arthur Miller , pp. 77–88       Miller is known for the consciousness of the characters in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in  All My Sons  and John Proctor in  The Crucible . Popkin, Henry, Arthur Miller: The Strange Encounter, The Sewanee Review, Vol. 68, No. 1 , pp. 34-60 Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.         Millers determination to deal with the eternal themes of life, death and human purpose is one of his most prominent themes across his works. This theme spans from Willy Lomans dedication to providing for his family and his inherent belief that his death would leave a legacy, to John Proctors willingness to die to preserve his name. Nearly all of Millers protagonists struggle with the mark they leave on life and what it means to die. Broderick, Bridget and Stein, Jean, ″Contemporary Literary Criticism″, eds. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale, 1983. 617 pp.           In Death of a Salesman – originally entitled The Inside of His Head – Miller brilliantly solves the problem of revealing his main characters inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. Arthur Miller, The Pulitzer Prices, pulitzerprize.org Death of a Salesman seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.     Willy Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded, that he is “well liked” as a great salesman, a fine father, and a devoted husband. That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.       Eddie Carbone is the central character in  A View from the Bridge  and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antagonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small world that he operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement with one of his Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Millers examples of tragic figures. Epstein, Arthur, A Look at A View from The Bridge , Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 7, No. 1 , pp. 109–22 Krase, Jerome, The American Italian Historical Society: A View from The Bridge , Polish American Studies, Vol. 65, No. 1 , pp. 23–40       John Proctor is the protagonist of one of Millers most controversial works,  The Crucible . He is a faithful farmer who lives by a strict moral code that he violates by succumbing to an affair with a young girl, Abigail, who serves in his home. After Proctor rejects her, Abigail spitefully accuses Johns wife of witchcraft, involving him in a string of affairs that challenge his beliefs and convictions. In his attempts to save his wife, he is convicted of witchcraft as well, and will only be acquitted if he confesses to his crime and signs his name to a piece of paper. Popkin, Harry, Arthur Millers The Crucible ,  College English , Vol. 26, No. 2 , pp. 139–14  Proctor is a strong, vital man in the prime of his life both in his confession of witchcraft and the subsequent passion with which he defends his name at the cost of his life. McGill, William Jr. The Crucible of History: Millers John Proctor The New England Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 2 , pp. 258–64       Critics have long admired the playwrights suspenseful handling of the Keller familys burden in the play  All My Sons . The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake because it would have driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority. Joes irresponsibility is exposed through his sons questioning of his very humanity. Joes suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play.        |Christopher_Bigsby|Christopher_Bigsby|  wrote Arthur Miller: The Definitive Biography based on boxes of papers Miller made available to him before his death in 2005.
