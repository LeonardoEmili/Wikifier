:This article deals with protein targeting in eukaryote s except where noted.   Protein targeting or protein sorting is the biological mechanism by which  |proteins|Protein|  are transported to their appropriate destinations in the cell or outside it. Proteins can be targeted to the inner space of an  |organelle|Organelle| , different intracellular  |membranes|Biological_Membrane| ,  |plasma_membrane|Cell_Membrane| , or to exterior of the cell via  |secretion|Secretion| . This delivery process is carried out based on information contained in the protein itself. Correct sorting is crucial for the cell; errors can lead to diseases.           Targeting signals are the pieces of information that enable the cellular transport machinery to correctly position a protein inside or outside the cell. This information is contained in the  |polypeptide_chain|Primary_Structure|  or in the folded protein. The continuous stretch of  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  residues in the chain that enables targeting are called  |signal_peptides|Signal_Peptide|  or targeting peptides. There are two types of targeting peptides, the presequences and the internal targeting peptides. The presequences of the targeting peptide are often found at the N-terminal extension and is composed of between 6-136 basic and hydrophobic amino acids. In case of peroxisomes the targeting sequence is on the C-terminal extension mostly. Other signals, known as  |signal_patches|Signal_Patches| , are composed of parts which are separate in the  |primary_sequence|Primary_Sequence| . They become functional when  |folding|Protein_Folding|  brings them together on the protein surface. In addition,  |protein_modifications|Posttranslational_Modification|  like glycosylations can induce targeting.          In 1970,  |Günter_Blobel|Günter_Blobel|  conducted experiments on the translocation of proteins across membranes. He was awarded the 1999  |Nobel_prize|Nobel_Prize_In_Physiology_Or_Medicine|  for his findings. He discovered that many proteins have a  |signal_sequence|Signal_Peptide| , that is, a short  |amino_acid|Amino_Acid|  sequence at one end that functions like a  |postal_code|Postal_Code|  for the target organelle. The  |translation|Translation|  of  |mRNA|Mrna|  into protein by a  |ribosome|Ribosome|  takes place within the  |cytosol|Cytosol| . If the synthesized proteins belong in a different organelle, they can be transported there in either of two ways depending on the protein: Co-translational translocation , and post-translational translocation .       Most proteins that are secretory, membrane-bound, or reside in the  |endoplasmic_reticulum|Endoplasmic_Reticulum|  ,  |golgi|Golgi_Apparatus|  or  |endosomes|Endosome|  use the co-translational translocation pathway. This process begins with the N-terminal  |signal_peptide|Signal_Peptide|  of the protein being recognized by a  |signal_recognition_particle|Signal_Recognition_Particle|  while the protein is still being synthesized on the ribosome. The synthesis pauses while the ribosome-protein complex is transferred to an  |SRP_receptor|Srp_Receptor|  on the ER in  |eukaryotes|Eukaryotes| , and the plasma membrane in  |prokaryotes|Prokaryotes| . There, the nascent protein is inserted into the translocon, a membrane-bound protein conducting channel composed of the  |Sec61_translocation_complex|Sec61|  in eukaryotes, and the homologous  |SecYEG|Transloconthe_Prokaryotic_Translocon|  complex in prokaryotes. In secretory proteins and type I  |transmembrane_proteins|Transmembrane_Proteins| , the signal sequence is immediately cleaved from the nascent polypeptide once it has been translocated into the membrane of the ER or plasma membrane by  |signal_peptidase|Signal_Peptidase| . The signal sequence of type II membrane proteins and some polytopic membrane proteins are not cleaved off and therefore are referred to as signal anchor sequences. Within the ER, the protein is first covered by a  |chaperone_protein|Chaperone|  to protect it from the high concentration of other proteins in the ER, giving it time to  |fold|Protein_Folding|  correctly. Once folded, the protein is modified as needed , then transported to the Golgi for further processing and goes to its target organelles or is retained in the ER by various  |ER_retention|Er_Retention|  mechanisms.     The amino acid chain of  |transmembrane_proteins|Transmembrane_Proteins| , which often are  |transmembrane_receptors|Transmembrane_Receptors| , passes through a membrane one or several times. They are inserted into the membrane by translocation, until the process is interrupted by a stop-transfer sequence, also called a membrane anchor or signal-anchor sequence. These complex membrane proteins are at the moment mostly understood using the same model of targeting that has been developed for secretory proteins. However, many complex multi-transmembrane proteins contain structural aspects that do not fit the model. Seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors mostly do not have an amino-terminal signal sequence. In contrast to secretory proteins, the first transmembrane domain acts as the first signal sequence, which targets them to the ER membrane. This also results in the translocation of the amino terminus of the protein into the ER membrane lumen. This would seem to break the rule of co-translational translocation which has always held for mammalian proteins targeted to the ER. This has been demonstrated with  |opsin|Opsin|  with in vitro experiments. Kanner EM, Friedlander M, Simon SM. . Co-translational targeting and translocation of the amino terminus of opsin across the endoplasmic membrane requires GTP but not ATP . J. Biol. Chem. 278 : 7920–7926. . . Kanner EM, Klein IK. et al. . The amino terminus of opsin translocates posttranslationally as efficiently as cotranslationally . Biochemistry 41 : 7707–7715. . . A great deal of the mechanics of transmembrane topology and folding remains to be elucidated.       Even though most secretory proteins are co-translationally translocated, some are translated in the  |cytosol|Cytosol|  and later transported to the ER/plasma membrane by a post-translational system. In prokaryotes this requires certain cofactors such as  |SecA|Seca|  and  |SecB|Secb| . This pathway is poorly understood in eukaryotes, but is facilitated by  |Sec62|Sec62|  and  |Sec63|Sec63| , two membrane-bound proteins.     In addition, proteins targeted to other destinations, such as  |mitochondria|Mitochondria| ,  |chloroplasts|Chloroplasts| , or  |peroxisomes|Peroxisomes| , use specialized post-translational pathways. Also, proteins targeted for the nucleus are translocated post-translation. They pass through the  |nuclear_envelope|Nuclear_Envelope|  via  |nuclear_pores|Nuclear_Pore| .         Most  |mitochondrial|Mitochondrion| |proteins|Protein|  are synthesized as  |cytosolic|Cytosolic|  precursors containing uptake  |peptide_signals|Peptide_Signal| .  |Cytosolic|Cytosolic| |chaperones|Chaperone|  deliver  |preproteins|Preprotein|  to channel linked receptors in the  |mitochondrial_membrane|Mitochondrial_Membrane| . The  |preprotein|Preprotein|  with presequence targeted for the  |mitochondria|Mitochondria|  is bound by  |receptors|Receptor|  and the General Import Pore at the  |outer_membrane|Outer_Mitochondrial_Membrane| . The preprotein is translocated through TOM as hairpin loops. The preprotein is transported through the  |intermembrane_space|Intermembrane_Space|  by small TIMs  to the TIM23 or 22 at the  |inner_membrane|Inner_Mitochondrial_Membrane| . Within the  |matrix|Matrix|  the  |targeting_sequence|Targeting_Sequence|  is cleaved off by mtHsp70.     Three  |mitochondrial|Mitochondrial|  outer membrane  |receptors|Receptor|  are known:   ;TOM70: Binds to internal targeting peptides and acts as a docking point for cytosolic chaperones.   ;TOM20: Binds presequences   ;TOM22: Binds both presequences and internal targeting peptides   The TOM channel  is a  |cation|Cation|  specific high conductance channel with a  |molecular_weight|Molecular_Weight|  of 410  |kDa|Kda|  and a pore  |diameter|Diameter|  of 21Å.     The presequence translocase23 is localized to the  |mitochondrial_inner_membrane|Inner_Mitochondrial_Membrane|  and acts a pore forming protein which binds precursor proteins with its  |N_terminus|N_Terminus| . TIM23 acts a translocator for preproteins for the mitochondrial matrix, the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as for the intermembrane space. TIM50 is bound to TIM23 at the inner mitochondrial side and found to bind presequences. TIM44 is bound on the matrix side and found binding to mtHsp70.   The presequence translocase22 binds preproteins exclusively bound for the inner mitochondrial membrane.      |Mitochondrial_matrix|Mitochondrial_Matrix|  targeting sequences are rich in positively charged amino acids and hydroxylated ones.     Proteins are targeted to submitochondrial compartments by multiple signals and several pathways.     Targeting to the outer membrane,  |intermembrane_space|Intermembrane_Space| , and inner membrane often requires another signal sequence in addition to the matrix targeting sequence.       The preprotein for  |chloroplasts|Chloroplast|  may contain a stromal import sequence or a stromal and thylakoid targeting sequence. The majority of preproteins are translocated through the Toc and Tic complexes located within the chloroplast envelope. In the stroma the stromal import sequence is cleaved off and folded as well as intra-chloroplast sorting to  |thylakoids|Thylakoid|  continues. Proteins targeted to the envelope of chloroplasts usually lack cleavable sorting sequence.       Many proteins are needed in both  |mitochondria|Mitochondria|  and  |chloroplasts|Chloroplasts| . In general the targeting peptide is of intermediate character to the two specific ones. The targeting peptides of these  |proteins|Protein|  have a high content of basic and  |hydrophobic|Hydrophobic| |_amino_acids|Amino_Acids| , a low content of negatively charged  |amino_acids|Amino_Acids| . They have a lower content of alanine and a higher content of leucine and phenylalanine. The dual targeted proteins have a more hydrophobic targeting peptide than both mitochondrial and chloroplastic ones.       All  |peroxisomal|Peroxisome|  proteins are encoded by nuclear genes.     To date there are two types of known  |Peroxisome_Targeting_Signals|Peroxisomal_Targeting_Signal|  :     Peroxisome targeting signal 1  |serine|Serine| - |lysine|Lysine| - |leucine|Leucine|  . Most peroxisomal matrix proteins possess a PTS1 type signal.     Peroxisome targeting signal 2  |Zellweger_syndrome|Zellweger_Syndrome| .    |Adrenoleukodystrophy|Adrenoleukodystrophy|  .   Refsum disease       As discussed above , most prokaryotic membrane-bound and secretory proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane by either a co-translation pathway that uses bacterial SRP or a post-translation pathway that requires SecA and SecB. At the plasma membrane, these two pathways deliver proteins to the SecYEG translocon for translocation. Bacteria may have a single plasma membrane , or an inner membrane plus an outer membrane separated by the  |periplasm|Periplasm|  . Besides the plasma membrane the majority of prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles as found in eukaryotes, but they may assemble proteins onto various types of inclusions such as gas vesicles and storage granules.          In gram-negative bacteria proteins may be incorporated into the plasma membrane, the outer membrane, the periplasm or secreted into the environment. Systems for secreting proteins across the bacterial outer membrane may be quite complex and play key roles in pathogenesis. These systems may be described as type I secretion, type II secretion, etc.          In most gram-positive bacteria, certain proteins are targeted for export across the plasma membrane and subsequent covalent attachment to the bacterial cell wall. A specialized enzyme,  |sortase|Sortase| , cleaves the target protein at a characteristic recognition site near the protein C-terminus, such as an LPXTG motif , then transfers the protein onto the cell wall. Several analogous systems are found that likewise feature a signature motif on the extracytoplasmic face, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and cluster of basic residues on the cytosolic face at the proteins extreme C-terminus. The PEP-CTERM/ |exosortase|Exosortase|  system, found in many Gram-negative bacteria, seems to be related to  |extracellular_polymeric_substance|Extracellular_Polymeric_Substance|  production. The PGF-CTERM/archaeosortase A system in  |archaea|Archaea|  is related to  |S_layer|S_Layer|  production. The GlyGly-CTERM/rhombosortase system, found in the Shewanella, Vibrio, and a few other genera, seems involved in the release of proteases, nucleases, and other enzymes.        |Minimotif_Miner|Minimotif_Miner| .
