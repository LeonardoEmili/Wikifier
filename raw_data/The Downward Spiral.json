Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Kyle Anderson remembered watching the music video of Closer on MTV as an adolescent and expressed that the album changed his perception of popular music from that of songs heard on the radio to albums with cover art.   Stereogum s Tom Breihan remains favorable toward the album since it is the one that most fully inhabits Nine Inch Nails characteristics and influenced youth culture, with teenagers wearing ripped fish nets on their arms.
