      The major scale  is one of the most commonly used  |musical_scales|Scale| , especially in  |Western_music|Western_Culturemusic| . It is one of the  |diatonic_scales|Diatonic_Scale| . Like many musical scales, it is made up of seven  |notes|Musical_Note| : the eighth duplicates the first at double its  |frequency|Frequency|  so that it is called a higher  |octave|Octave|  of the same note .     The simplest major scale to  |write|Musical_Notationmodern_Musical_Notation|  is  |C_major|C_Major| , the only major scale not requiring  |sharps|Sharp|  or  |flats|Flat| :     :       The major scale had a central importance in Western music, particularly in the  |common_practice_period|Common_Practice_Period|  and in  |popular_music|Popular_Music| .     In  |Carnatic_music|Carnatic_Music| , it is known as  Dheerasankarabharanam . In  |Hindustani_classical_music|Hindustani_Classical_Music| , it is known as  Bilaval .            A major scale is a  |diatonic_scale|Diatonic_Scale| . The sequence of  |intervals|Interval|  between the notes of a major scale is:     : whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half     where whole stands for a  |whole_tone|Major_Second|  , and half stands for a  |semitone|Semitone|  .      A major scale may be seen as two identical  |tetrachords|Tetrachord|  separated by a whole tone. Each tetrachord consists of two whole tones followed by a  |semitone|Semitone|  .     The major scale is  |maximally_even|Maximal_Evenness| .       :       The  |scale_degrees|Degree|  are:     1st:  |Tonic|Tonic| |Supertonic|Supertonic| |Mediant|Mediant| |Subdominant|Subdominant| |Dominant|Dominant| |Submediant|Submediant| |Leading_tone|Leading-Tone| |Tonic|Tonic|        :       The triads built on each scale degree follow a distinct pattern. The  |roman_numeral_analysis|Roman_Numeral_Analysis|  is shown in parentheses.   1st:  |Major_triad|Major_Triad|    2nd:  |minor_triad|Minor_Triad|    3rd: minor triad   4th: Major triad   5th: Major triad   6th: minor triad   7th:  |diminished_triad|Diminished_Triad|        If a piece of music is in a  |major_key|Major_Key| , then the notes in the corresponding major scale are considered diatonic notes, while the notes outside the major scale are considered  |chromatic_notes|Chromaticism| . Moreover, the  |key_signature|Key_Signature|  of the piece of music will generally reflect the  |accidentals|Accidental|  in the corresponding major scale.     For instance, if a piece of music is in E major, then the seven pitches in the E major scale  are considered diatonic pitches, and the other five pitches  are considered chromatic pitches. In this case, the key signature will have three flats .     The figure below shows all 12 relative major and minor keys, with major keys on the outside and minor keys on the inside arranged around the  |circle_of_fifths|Circle_Of_Fifths| .          The numbers inside the circle show the number of sharps or flats in the key signature, with the sharp keys going clockwise, and the flat keys counterclockwise from C major The circular arrangement depends on  |enharmonic|Enharmonic|  relationships in the circle, usually reckoned at six sharps or flats for the major keys of F G and D E for minor keys.  Seven sharps or flats make major keys  that may be more conveniently spelled with five flats or sharps .       The term major scale is also used in the names of some other scales whose first, third, and fifth degrees form a  |major_triad|Major_Triad| .     The  |harmonic_major_scale|Harmonic_Major_Scale|     has a minor sixth. It differs from the  |harmonic_minor_scale|Harmonic_Minor_Scale|  only by raising the third degree.     :       There are two scales that go by the name  |melodic_major_scale|Melodic_Major_Scale| |jazz_minor_scale|Jazz_Minor_Scale|   , which can be thought of as the major scale  with a lowered sixth and seventh degree or the  |natural_minor_scale|Aeolian_Mode|   with a raised third.     :       The second is the combined scale that goes as Ionian ascending and as the previous melodic major descending. It differs from  |melodic_minor_scale|Melodic_Minor_Scale|  only by raising the third degree to a major third.      :       The  |double_harmonic_major_scale|Double_Harmonic_Major_Scale|    has a minor second and a minor sixth. It is the fifth mode of the  |Hungarian_minor_scale|Hungarian_Minor_Scale|.
