   Rheged  was one of the kingdoms of the  Hen Ogledd  , the  |Brittonic|Brittonic_Languages| -speaking region of what is now  |Northern_England|Northern_England|  and southern  |Scotland|Scotland| , during the  |post_Roman_era|Sub_Roman_Britain|  and  |Early_Middle_Ages|Early_Middle_Ages| . It is recorded in several poetic and  |bardic|Bard|  sources, although its borders are not described in any of them. A recent archaeological discovery suggests that its stronghold was located in what is now  |Galloway|Galloway|  in  |Scotland|Scotland|  rather than, as was previously speculated, being in  |Cumbria|Cumbria| . Rheged possibly extended into  |Lancashire|Lancashire|  and other parts of northern England. In some sources, Rheged is intimately associated with the king  |Urien_Rheged|Urien|  and his family. Its inhabitants spoke  |Cumbric|Cumbric| , a Brittonic dialect closely related to  |Old_Welsh|Old_Welsh| .       The name Rheged appears regularly as an  |epithet|Epithet|  of a certain  |Urien|Urien|  in a number of early Welsh poems and royal genealogies. His victories over the  |Anglian|Angles|  chieftains of  |Bernicia|Bernicia|  in the second half of the 6th century are recorded by  |Nennius|Nennius|  and celebrated by the bard  |Taliesin|Taliesin| , who calls him Ruler of Rheged . He is thus placed squarely in the North of Britain and perhaps specifically in  |Westmorland|Westmorland|  when referred to as Ruler of Llwyfenydd .  Later legend associates Urien with the city of  |Carlisle|Carlisle_Cumbria|  , only twenty-five miles away; Higham suggests that Rheged was broadly conterminous with the earlier Civitas Carvetiorum, the Roman administrative unit based on Carlisle . Although it is possible that Rheged was merely a stronghold, it was not uncommon for sub-Roman monarchs to use their kingdoms name as an epithet. It is generally accepted, therefore, that Rheged was a kingdom covering a large part of modern  |Cumbria|Cumbria| .      |Place_name|Toponymy|  evidence, e.g.,  |Dunragit|Dunragit|   suggests that, at least in one period of its history, Rheged included  |Dumfries_and_Galloway|Dumfries_And_Galloway| . Recent archaeological excavations at  |Trustys_Hill|Trustys_Hill| , a  |vitrified_fort|Vitrified_Fort|  near  |Gatehouse_of_Fleet|Gatehouse_Of_Fleet| , and the analysis of its artefacts in the context of other sites and their artefacts have led to claims that the kingdom was centred on Galloway early in the 7th century. Toolis, R; Bowles, C . The Lost Dark Age Kingdom of Rheged: The Discovery of a Royal Stronghold at Trustys Hill, Galloway, Oxbow Books Limited.      More problematic interpretations suggest that it could also have reached as far south as  |Rochdale|Rochdale|  in  |Greater_Manchester|Greater_Manchester| , recorded in the  |Domesday_Book|Domesday_Book|  as Recedham. The  |River_Roch|River_Roch|  on which Rochdale stands was recorded in the 13th century as Rached or Rachet. Such names may derive from Old English reced hall or house . Ekwall, Eilert, The place-names of Lancashire, Manchester University Press, 1922, p. 55. However, no other place names originating from this Old English element exist, which makes this derivation unlikely. Clarkson, T. J., The Men of the North: The Britons of Southern Scotland, John Donald, 2010, p. 72. If they are not of English origin, these place-names may incorporate the element Rheged precisely because they lay on or near its borders. Certainly Uriens kingdom stretched eastward at one time, as he was also Ruler of  |Catraeth|Catraeth|  .       The traditional royal genealogy of Urien and his successors traces their ancestry back to  |Coel_Hen|Coel_Hen|  , Harbus, A. Magnus Maximus and the Welsh Helena in Helena of Britain in Medieval Legend, Boydell & Brewer, p. 54 Ford, P.K. Llywarch, Ancestor of Welsh Princes, Speculum,   Vol. 45, No. 3, p. 443 - This author argues that the term hen in the context of early Welsh genealogies has a primary meaning of heroic ancestor , rather than that the possessor of the epithet necessarily lived to a great age. who is considered by many to be a mythical figure; if he has some historicity, he may have ruled a considerable part of the North in the early 5th century. All of those listed below may have ruled in Rheged, but only three of their number can be verified from external sources:      |Meirchion_Gul|Meirchion_Gul| , father of Cynfarch    |Cynfarch_Oer|Cynfarch_Oer|  , also known as Cynfarch fab Meirchion and Cynfarch Gul, father of Urien    |Urien_Rheged|Urien| , , about whom survive eight songs of  |Taliesin|Taliesin| |_Owain|Owain_Mab_Urien| , also celebrated for having fought the  |Bernicia|Bernicia| ns; son of Urien     There are two possible later kings of Rheged:     Rhun, said to have been a son of Urien. He is recorded in Welsh sources as having baptised  |Edwin_of_Northumbria|Edwin_Of_Northumbria| , however, he may merely have stood sponsor at the baptism, thus becoming Edwins  |godfather|Godparent| . Corning, Caitlin The Baptism of Edwin, King of Northumbria: A New Analysis of the British Tradition, Northern History, 36:1, 5-15, DOI:   10.1179/007817200790178030   Royth , son of Rhun, and possibly the last king of Rheged. Andrew Breeze Northumbria and the Family of Rhun, Northern History, 50:2, pp. 170-179, DOI: 10.1179/0078172X13Z.00000000039       A second royal genealogy exists for a line, perhaps of kings, descended from Cynfarch Oers brother: Elidir Lydanwyn. According to  Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd  Elidirs son,  |Llywarch_Hen|Llywarch_Hen| , was a ruler in North Britain in the 6th century. He was driven from his territory by princely in-fighting after Uriens death and was perhaps in old age associated with  |Powys|Kingdom_Of_Powys| . However, it is possible, because of internal inconsistencies, that the poetry connected to  |Powys|Powys|  was associated with Llywarchs name at a later, probably 9th century, date. Llywarch is referred to in some poems as king of South Rheged, and in others as king of Argoed, suggesting that the two regions were the same. Searching for Llywarchs kingdom has led some historians to propose that Rheged may have been divided between sons, resulting in northern and southern successor states. The connections of the family of Llywarch and Urien with Powys has suggested to some, on grounds of proximity, that the area of modern  |Lancashire|Lancashire|  may have been their original home.       After Bernicia united with  |Deira|Deira|  to become the kingdom of  |Northumbria|Northumbria| , Rheged was annexed by Northumbria, some time before AD 730. There was a royal marriage between Prince  |Oswiu_of_Northumbria|Oswiu_Of_Northumbria|  and the Rhegedian princess  |Rieinmelth|Rhiainfellt| , granddaughter of Rum , probably in 638, so it is possible that it was a peaceful takeover, both kingdoms being inherited by the same man. Jackson, K.H. The Britons in Southern Scotland, Antiquity, xxix, pp. 77–88 Lewis, Helen Whose Cultural Heritage? Etifeddiaeth Ddiwylliannol i Bwy?, English in Education, Taylor & Francis     After Rheged was incorporated into  |Northumbria|Northumbria| , the old  |Cumbric_language|Cumbric_Language|  was gradually replaced by  |Old_English|Old_English| , Cumbric surviving only in remote upland communities. Around the year 900, after the power of Northumbria was destroyed by Viking incursions and settlement, large areas west of the  |Pennines|Pennines|  fell without apparent warfare under the control of the British  |Kingdom_of_Strathclyde|Kingdom_Of_Strathclyde| , with  |Leeds|Leeds|  recorded as being on the border between the Britons and the Norse Kingdom of  |York|York| . This may have represented the political assertion of lingering British culture in the region. The area of  |Cumbria|Cumbria|  remained under the control of Strathclyde until the early 11th century when Strathclyde itself was absorbed into the Scottish kingdom. The name of the people, whose modern Welsh form is  has, however, survived in the name of  |Cumberland|Cumberland|  and now Cumbria; it probably derives from an old Celtic word Kombroges meaning fellow countrymen .       Previously, Rheged was assumed to have been centred somewhere in Cumbria, northwest England. However, in 2012 archaeologists found evidence at  |Trustys_Hill|Trustys_Hill|  near the town of  |Gatehouse_of_Fleet|Gatehouse_Of_Fleet| , in Galloway, southwest Scotland, suggesting that the site may in fact have been Rhegeds capital . The discovery was announced to the public in January 2017 and the site is still under excavation.     One of the lead researchers, Ronan Toolis, stated that their findings revealed structural ruins atop the hill. These originally belonged to a fortification system with a timber-reinforced stone rampart where the main fortification was supplemented by smaller defensive works along the low-lying slopes. According to Toolis, this suggests the presence of a royal stronghold of the period: This is a type of fort that has been recognized in Scotland as a form of high status secular settlement of the early medieval period. The evidence makes a compelling case for Galloway being the core of the kingdom of Rheged.

According to the  |University_of_Oxfords|University_Of_Oxford|  People of the British Isles project, the original population of Rheged has left a distinct genetic heritage amongst the people of Cumbria. The research compared the  |DNA|Dna|  of over 2000 people across the British Isles whose grandparents were all born within  of each other, and found a number of cases, including Rheged, where genetic clusters of people matched the location of historical kingdoms .        :but see: Clarkson, T. J., The Men of the North: The Britons of Southern Scotland, John Donald, 2010, p. 71: Archaeologists are extremely sceptical that this was a site occupied in Early Historic times, still less that it was a royal residence. Such scepticism raises serious doubts about the usual derivation of the place-name Dunragit which may in fact be a red herring. It has been suggested that the second element could be Gaelic reichet rather than Old Welsh Reget, and that the place was so named by the Gall Gaidhil, foreign Gaels, who colonised Galloway in the Viking period. For Gaelic rechet, cf. the Old Irish place name Mag Roichet/Rechet , now  .
