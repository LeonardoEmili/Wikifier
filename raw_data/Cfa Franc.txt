The CFA franc  is the name of two  |currencies|Currency| , the  |West_African_CFA_franc|West_African_Cfa_Franc| , used in eight  |West_African|West_African| |countries|Countries| , and the  |Central_African_CFA_franc|Central_African_Cfa_Franc| , used in six Central African countries. Both currencies are guaranteed by the French treasury. Although separate, the two CFA franc currencies have always been at parity and are effectively interchangeable. The  |ISO_currency_codes|Iso_4217|  are XAF for the  |Central_African_CFA_franc|Central_African_Cfa_Franc|  and XOF for the  |West_African_CFA_franc|West_African_Cfa_Franc| .

The currency has been criticized for making economic planning for the developing countries of French West Africa all but impossible since the CFAs value is pegged to the euro . A strong currency like the CFA franc makes exports from the CFA-franc zone much more costly than they would ordinarily be and as a result economic growth suffers accordingly. Since most of the countries that use the currency are poor, mostly agricultural economies, this has put a stranglehold on their trade and made them overly dependent upon continuing, privileged access to French and, though them, European markets. That this effectively recreates a quasi-colonial trading relationship between France and its former African colonies that benefits France mightily has not been lost on observers. - See more at:  , FOREX Africa: The CFA Franc aka The African Euro, By Jeffrey Cavanaugh AFKI Original Published: February 12, 2014, 02:11pm,  Others disagree and argue that the CFA helps stabilize the national currencies of Franc Zone member-countries and greatly facilitates the flow of exports and imports between France and the member-countries .

The CFA franc was created on 26 December 1945, along with the  |CFP_franc|Cfp_Franc| . The reason for their creation was the weakness of the  |French_franc|French_Franc|  immediately after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . When France ratified the  |Bretton_Woods_Agreement|Bretton_Woods_System|  in December 1945, the  |French_franc|French_Franc|  was  |devalued|Devaluation|  in order to set a  |fixed_exchange_rate|Fixed_Exchange_Rate|  with the  |US_dollar|Us_Dollar| . New currencies were created in the  |French_colonies|French_Colonies|  to spare them the strong devaluation, thereby facilitating imports from France. French officials presented the decision as an act of generosity.  |René_Pleven|René_Pleven| , the  |French_minister_of_finance|Minister_Of_The_Economy,_Finance_And_Industry| , was quoted as saying -            The CFA franc was created with a fixed exchange rate versus the  |French_franc|French_Franc| . This exchange rate was changed only twice: in 1948 and in 1994.     Exchange rate:   26 December 1945 to 16 October 1948   1 CFA franc 1.70 FRF . This 0.70 FRF  |premium|:Wikt:Premium|  is the consequence of the creation of the CFA franc, which spared the French African colonies the devaluation of December 1945 .   17 October 1948 to 31 December 1959   1 CFA franc 2.00 FRF   1 January 1960 to 11 January 1994   1 CFA franc 0.02 FRF   12 January 1994 to 31 December 1998   1 CFA franc 0.01 FRF   1 January 1999 onwards   100 CFA franc 0.152449 euro or 1 euro 655.957 CFA franc.      The 1960 and 1999 events were merely changes in the currency in use in France: the  |relative_value|Relative_Value|  of the CFA franc versus the French franc/euro changed only in 1948 and 1994.     The value of the CFA franc has been widely criticized as being too high, which many economists believe favours the urban elite of the African countries, who can buy imported manufactured goods cheaply at the expense of farmers who cannot easily export agricultural products. The devaluation of 1994 was an attempt to reduce these imbalances.       Over time, the number of countries and territories using the CFA franc has changed as some countries began introducing their own separate currencies. A couple of nations in West Africa have also chosen to adopt the CFA franc since its introduction, despite the fact that they were never French colonies.     1960:  |Guinea|Guinea|  leaves and begins issuing  |Guinean_francs|Guinean_Franc|    1962:  |Mali|Mali|  leaves and begins issuing  |Malian_francs|Malian_Franc|    1973:  |Madagascar|Madagascar|  leaves and begins issuing  |its_own_francs|Malagasy_Franc| , the Malagasy franc, which ran concurrently with the  |Malagasy_ariary|Malagasy_Ariary|    1973:  |Mauritania|Mauritania|  leaves, replacing the franc with the  |Mauritanian_ouguiya|Mauritanian_Ouguiya|    1974:  |Saint-Pierre_and_Miquelon|Saint-Pierre_And_Miquelon|  leaves for French franc   1975:  |Réunion|Réunion|  leaves for  |French_franc|French_Franc|  IEDOM/Banque de France - History,     1976:  |Mayotte|Mayotte|  leaves for  |French_franc|French_Franc|  IEDOM/Banque de France    1984:  |Mali|Mali|  rejoins    1985:  |Equatorial_Guinea|Equatorial_Guinea|  joins    1997:  |Guinea-Bissau|Guinea-Bissau|  joins        In 1998, in anticipation of  |Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union|Economic_And_Monetary_Union_Of_The_European_Union| , the  |Council_of_the_European_Union|Council_Of_The_European_Union|  addressed the monetary agreements France had with the CFA Zone and  |Comoros|Comoros|  and ruled that:   The agreements are unlikely to have any material effect on the  |monetary|Monetary_Policy|  and  |exchange_rate|Exchange-Rate_Regime|  policy of the  |Eurozone|Eurozone| |economic_and_monetary_union|Economic_And_Monetary_Union_Of_The_European_Union| |European_Central_Bank|European_Central_Bank|  or any national  |central_bank|Central_Bank|  to support the convertibility of the CFA and  |Comorian_francs|Comorian_Franc|    Modifications to the existing agreements will not lead to any obligations for the European Central or any national central bank   The French Treasury will guarantee the free convertibility at a fixed parity between the  |euro|Euro|  and the CFA and Comorian francs   The competent French authorities shall keep the  |European_Commission|European_Commission| , the European Central Bank and the Economic and Financial Committee informed about the implementation of the agreements and inform the Committee prior to changes of the parity between the euro and the CFA and Comorian francs   Any change to the nature or scope of the agreements would require Council approval on the basis of a Commission recommendation and ECB consultation       There are two different currencies called the CFA franc: the West African CFA franc , and the Central Africa CFA franc . They are distinguished in French by the meaning of the abbreviation CFA. These two CFA francs have the same exchange rate with the euro , and they are both guaranteed by the French treasury , but the West African CFA franc cannot be used in Central African countries, and the Central Africa CFA franc cannot be used in West African countries.             The West African CFA franc  is known in  |French|French_Language|  as the , where CFA stands for Communauté financière dAfrique or  .  It is issued by the BCEAO , located in  |Dakar|Dakar| ,  |Senegal|Senegal| , for the eight countries of the UEMOA             These eight countries have a combined population of 102.5  million people , and a combined GDP of US$78.4  billion .                The Central Africa CFA franc  is known in  |French|French_Language|  as the , where CFA stands for  . It is issued by the BEAC , located in  |Yaoundé|Yaoundé| ,  |Cameroon|Cameroon| , for the six countries of the CEMAC           These six countries have a combined population of 45.0  million people , and a combined GDP of US$88.2  billion .     In 1975, Central African CFA banknotes were issued with an  |obverse|Obverse|  unique to each participating country, and common reverse, in a fashion similar to  |euro_coins|Euro_Coins| .      |Equatorial_Guinea|Equatorial_Guinea| , the only former Spanish colony in the zone, adopted the CFA in 1984.       Critics argue that in exchange for the guarantees provided by the French treasury, African countries channel more money to France than they receive in aid. They also argue that they have no say in deciding key monetary policies.
