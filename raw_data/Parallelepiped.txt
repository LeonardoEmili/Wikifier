In  |geometry|Geometry| , a parallelepiped, parallelopiped or parallelopipedon is a three-dimensional figure formed by six  |parallelograms|Parallelogram|  . By analogy, it relates to a  |parallelogram|Parallelogram|  just as a  |cube|Cube|  relates to a  |square|Square|  or as a  |cuboid|Cuboid|  to a  |rectangle|Rectangle| . In  |Euclidean_geometry|Euclidean_Geometry| , its definition encompasses all four concepts . In this context of  |affine_geometry|Affine_Geometry| , in which angles are not differentiated, its definition admits only parallelograms and parallelepipeds. Three equivalent definitions of parallelepiped are   a  |polyhedron|Polyhedron|  with six faces , each of which is a parallelogram,   a hexahedron with three pairs of parallel faces, and   a  |prism|Prism|  of which the base is a  |parallelogram|Parallelogram| .   The rectangular  |cuboid|Cuboid|  ,  |cube|Cube|  , and the  |rhombohedron|Rhombohedron|   are all specific cases of parallelepiped.     Parallelepiped is now usually pronounced , , or ; traditionally it was   Oxford English Dictionary 1904; Websters Second International 1947 in accordance with its etymology in  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|  παραλληλ-επίπεδον, a body having parallel planes .     Parallelepipeds are a subclass of the  |prismatoids|Prismatoid| .       Any of the three pairs of parallel faces can be viewed as the base planes of the prism. A parallelepiped has three sets of four parallel edges; the edges within each set are of equal length.     Parallelepipeds result from  |linear_transformations|Linear_Transformation|  of a  |cube|Cube|  .     Since each face has  |point_symmetry|Point_Symmetry| , a parallelepiped is a  |zonohedron|Zonohedron| . Also the whole parallelepiped has point symmetry C i  . Each face is, seen from the outside, the mirror image of the opposite face. The faces are in general  |chiral|Chirality| , but the parallelepiped is not.     A  |space_filling_tessellation|Honeycomb|  is possible with  |congruent|Congruence|  copies of any parallelepiped.          A parallelepiped can be considered as an  |oblique_prism|Oblique_Prism|  with a  |parallelogram|Parallelogram|  as base.   Hence the volume V of a parallelepiped is the product of the base area B and the height h . With   : B    a        b         a     b     and the height h     c          one gets   : VB  h      c       a     b        c           :::::    .   The mixed product of three vectors is called  |triple_product|Triple_Product| . It can be described by a  |determinant|Determinant| .   Hence for   aT,   bT,   cT the volume is:   :   V         a1 & b1 & c1     a2 & b2 & c2     a3 & b3 & c3         .     An alternative representation of the volume uses geometric properties only:   :     V abc      with     ,     ,    and a,b,c the edge lengths.     ;Proof of :   The proof of  uses  |properties_of_a_determinant|Determinantproperties_Of_The_Determinant|    and the  |geometric_interpretation_of_the_dot_product|Dot_Productgeometric_Definition| |tetrahedron|Tetrahedron|  that shares three converging edges of a parallelepiped has a volume equal to one sixth of the volume of that parallelepiped .       The surface area of a parallelepiped is the sum the areas of the bounding parallelograms:   : A 2       :: 2  .              cube , which has six congruent square faces.   The parallelepiped with D 4h symmetry is known as a square cuboid, which has two square faces and four congruent rectangular faces.   The parallelepiped with D 3d symmetry is known as a  trigonal trapezohedron , which has six congruent  |rhombic|Rhombus|  faces .   For parallelepipeds with D 2h symmetry there are two cases:    Rectangular cuboid .   Right rhombic prismRight parallelogrammic prismOblique rhombic prismperfect parallelepiped is a parallelepiped with integer-length edges, face diagonals, and  |space_diagonals|Space_Diagonal| . In 2009, dozens of perfect parallelepipeds were shown to exist, . answering an open question of  |Richard_Guy|Richard_K_Guy| . One example has edges 271, 106, and 103, minor face diagonals 101, 266, and 255, major face diagonals 183, 312, and 323, and space diagonals 374, 300, 278, and 272.     Some perfect parallelopipeds having two rectangular faces are known. But it is not known whether there exist any with all faces rectangular; such a case would be called a perfect  |cuboid|Cuboid| .          |Coxeter|Coxeter|  called the generalization of a parallelepiped in higher dimensions a parallelotope .     Specifically in n-dimensional space it is called n-dimensional parallelotope, or simply n-parallelotope. Thus a  |parallelogram|Parallelogram|  is a 2-parallelotope and a parallelepiped is a 3-parallelotope.     More generally a parallelotope,   or voronoi parallelotope, has parallel and congruent opposite facets. So a 2-parallelotope is a  |parallelogon|Parallelogon|  which can also include certain hexagons, and a 3-parallelotope is a  |parallelohedron|Parallelohedron| , including 5 types of polyhedra.     The  |diagonals|Diagonals|  of an n-parallelotope intersect at one point and are bisected by this point.  |Inversion|Inversion_In_A_Point|  in this point leaves the n-parallelotope unchanged. See also  |fixed_points_of_isometry_groups_in_Euclidean_space|Fixed_Points_Of_Isometry_Groups_In_Euclidean_Space| .     The edges radiating from one vertex of a k-parallelotope form a  |k_frame|K_Frame|  of the vector space, and the parallelotope can be recovered from these vectors, by taking linear combinations of the vectors, with weights between 0 and 1.     The n-volume of an n-parallelotope embedded in   where m   n can be computed by means of the  |Gram_determinant|Gram_Determinant| . Alternatively, the volume is the norm of the  |exterior_product|Exterior_Product|  of the vectors:   : V   v1       vn   .     If m n, this amounts to the absolute value of the determinant of the n vectors.     Another formula to compute the volume of an n-parallelotope P in   , whose  vertices are V0,V1,   Vn , is   :     ,     where is the row vector formed by the concatenation of Vi and 1. Indeed, the determinant is unchanged if is subtracted from  math /math  .
