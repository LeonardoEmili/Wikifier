   A television channel is a  |terrestrial_frequency_or_virtual_number|Channel|  over which a television station or  |television_network|Television_Network|  is distributed. For example, in  |North_America|North_America| , channel 2 refers to the terrestrial or cable band of 54 to 60  |MHz|Mhz| , with  |carrier|Carrier_Wave| |frequencies|Frequency|  of 55.25  MHz for  |NTSC|Ntsc|  analog video  and 59.75  MHz for analog audio , or 55.31  MHz for digital  |ATSC|Atsc|  . Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider     Depending on the multinational  |bandplan|Bandplan|  for a given regional n,  |analog_television|Analog_Television|  channels are typically 6, 7, or 8  MHz in  |bandwidth|Bandwidth| , and therefore  |television_channel_frequencies|Television_Channel_Frequencies|  vary as well. Channel  |numbering|Numbering|  is also different.  |Digital_terrestrial_television|Digital_Terrestrial_Television|  channels are the same as their analog predecessors for  |legacy|Legacy_Technology|  reasons, however through  |multiplexing|Multiplexing| , each physical  |radio_frequency|Radio_Frequency|  channel can carry several  |digital_subchannels|Digital_Subchannel| . On  |satellites|Communications_Satellite| , each  |transponder|Transponder|  normally carries one channel, however multiple  |small,_independent_channels|Single_Channel_Per_Carrier|  can be on one transponder, with some loss of  |bandwidth|Bandwidth|  due to the need for  |guard_bands|Guard_Band|  between unrelated  |transmissions|Radio_Transmission| .  |ISDB|Isdb| , used in  |Japan|Japan|  and  |Brazil|Brazil| , has a similar segmented mode.     Preventing interference between terrestrial channels in the same area is accomplished by skipping at least one channel between two analog stations  |frequency_allocations|Frequency_Allocation| . Where channel numbers are sequential, frequencies are not  |contiguous|Wikt:Contiguity| , such as channel 6 to 7 skip from  |VHF|Vhf|  low to high band, and channel 13 to 14 jump to  |UHF|Uhf| . On cable TV, it is possible to use  |adjacent_channels|Adjacent_Channel|  only because they are all at the same power, something which could only be done terrestrially if the two stations were transmitted at the same  |power|Effective_Radiated_Power|  and  |height|Haat|  from the same  |location|Broadcast_Tower| . For DTT,  |selectivity|Selectivity|  is inherently better, therefore channels adjacent can be used even in the same  |area|Media_Market| .       Commonly, the term television channel is used to mean a  |television_station|Television_Station|  or its  |pay_television|Pay_Television|  counterpart . Sometimes, especially outside the U.S. and in the context of pay television, it is used instead of the term  |television_network|Television_Network| , which otherwise describes a group of geographically-distributed television stations that share  |affiliation|Network_Affiliate| / |ownership|O_&_O|  and some or all of their programming with one another.   This terminology may be muddled somewhat in other  |jurisdictions|Jurisdiction| , for instance  |Europe|Europe| , where terrestrial channels are commonly mapped from physical channels to common numerical positions . On digital platforms, such channels are usually arbitrary and changeable, due to  |virtual_channels|Virtual_Channel| .          A television station is a type of terrestrial station that  |broadcasts|Broadcasting|  both  |audio|Soundframe|  and  |video|Video|  to  |television|Television| |receivers|Receiver|  in a particular area. Traditionally, TV stations made their broadcasts by sending specially-encoded  |radio|Radio|  signals over the air, called  |terrestrial_television|Terrestrial_Television| . Individual television stations are usually granted  |licenses|License|  by a  |government_agency|Government_Agency|  to use a particular section of the  |radio_spectrum|Radio_Spectrum|   through which they send their signals. Some stations use  |LPTV|Lptv| |broadcast_translators|Broadcast_Translator|  to  |retransmit|Repeater|  to further areas.        Many television stations are now in the process of converting from  |analog|Analog| ue terrestrial  broadcast, to  |digital_terrestrial|Digital_Terrestrial_Television|  .       Because some regions have had difficulty picking up  |terrestrial_television|Terrestrial_Television|  signals , alternative means of distribution such as direct-to-home satellite and cable television have been introduced. Television channels specifically built to run on cable or satellite blur the line between TV station and TV network. That fact led some early cable channels to call themselves  |superstations|Superstation| .     Satellite and cable have created changes.  |Local_programming|Local_Programming|  TV stations in an area can  |sign-up|Retransmission_Consent|  or even  |be_required|Must-Carry|  to be carried on cable, but content providers like  |TLC|Tlc|  cannot. They are not licensed to run broadcast equipment like a station, and they do not regularly provide content to licensed broadcasters either. Furthermore, a distributor like  |TNT|Turner_Network_Television|  may start producing its own programming, and shows presented exclusively on pay-TV by one distributor may be  |syndicated|Television_Syndication|  to terrestrial stations. The cost of creating a nationwide channel has been reduced and there has been a huge increase in the number of such channels, with most catering to a small group. See also:  |significantly_viewed|Significantly_Viewed_Out_Of_Market_Tv_Stations_In_The_United_States| .     From the definitions above, use of the terms network or station in reference to nationwide cable or satellite channels is technically inaccurate. However, this is an arbitrary, inconsequential distinction, and varies from company to company. Indeed, the term  |cable_network|Cable_Network|  has entered into common usage in the United States in reference to such channels. There is even some geographical separation among national pay television channels in the U.S., be it programming , or simply regionalized advertising inserted by the local cable company.     Should a legal distinction be necessary between a channel as defined above and a television channel in this sense, the terms programming service  or programming undertaking .
