                 Charles I  was  |King_of_England|King_Of_England| ,  |King_of_Scotland|King_Of_Scotland| , and  |King_of_Ireland|King_Of_Ireland|  from 27 March 1625 until  |his_execution|Execution_Of_Charles_I|  in 1649.     Charles was born into the  |House_of_Stuart|House_Of_Stuart|  as the second son of  |King_James_VI_of_Scotland|King_James_Vi_Of_Scotland| , but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 , he moved to England, where he spent much of the rest of his life. He became  |heir_apparent|Heir_Apparent|  to the three kingdoms of  |England|Kingdom_Of_England| ,  |Scotland|Kingdom_Of_Scotland|  and  |Ireland|Kingdom_Of_Ireland|  in 1612 on the death of his elder brother  |Henry_Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales|Henry_Frederick,_Prince_Of_Wales| . An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the  |Spanish_Habsburg|Spanish_Habsburg|  princess  |Maria_Anna|Maria_Anna_Of_Spain|  culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later he married the  |Bourbon|House_Of_Bourbon|  princess  |Henrietta_Maria_of_France|Henrietta_Maria_Of_France| .     After his succession in 1625, Charles quarrelled with the  |Parliament_of_England|Parliament_Of_England| , which sought to curb his  |royal_prerogative|Royal_Prerogative| . Charles believed in the  |divine_right_of_kings|Divine_Right_Of_Kings| , and was determined to govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical  |absolute_monarch|Absolute_Monarch| . His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic| , generated the antipathy and mistrust of  |Reformed|Reformed|  groups such as the English  |Puritans|Puritan|  and Scottish  |Covenanters|Covenanter| , who thought his views were too Catholic. He supported  |high_church|High_Church| |Anglican|Anglican|  ecclesiastics, such as  |Richard_Montagu|Richard_Montagu|  and  |William_Laud|William_Laud| , and failed to aid  |Protestant|Protestant|  forces successfully during the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| . His attempts to force the  |Church_of_Scotland|Church_Of_Scotland|  to adopt high Anglican practices led to the  |Bishops_Wars|Bishops_Wars| , strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments, and helped precipitate his own downfall.     From 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the  |English_Civil_War|English_Civil_War| . After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors demands for a  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy| , and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the  |Isle_of_Wight|Isle_Of_Wight| , Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648  |Oliver_Cromwells|Oliver_Cromwell| |New_Model_Army|New_Model_Army|  had consolidated its control over England. Charles was  |tried|High_Court_Of_Justice_For_The_Trial_Of_King_Charles_I| , convicted, and  |executed|Execution_Of_Charles_I|  for  |high_treason|High_Treason|  in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and the  |Commonwealth_of_England|Commonwealth_Of_England|  was established as a  |republic|Republic| . The monarchy would be  |restored|English_Restoration|  to Charless son,  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_England| , in 1660.            The second son of King  |James_VI_of_Scotland|James_Vi_Of_Scotland|  and  |Anne_of_Denmark|Anne_Of_Denmark| , Charles was born in  |Dunfermline_Palace|Dunfermline_Palace| ,  |Fife|Fife| , on 19 November 1600. ; . At a  |Protestant|Protestant|  ceremony in the  |Chapel_Royal|Chapel_Royal|  of  |Holyrood_Palace|Holyrood_Palace|  in  |Edinburgh|Edinburgh|  on 23 December 1600, he was baptised by  |David_Lindsay|David_Lindsay| ,  |Bishop_of_Ross|Bishop_Of_Ross| , and created  |Duke_of_Albany|Duke_Of_Albany| , the traditional title of the second son of the King of Scotland, with the  |subsidiary_titles|Subsidiary_Title|  of  |Marquess_of_Ormond|Earl_Of_Ormond| ,  |Earl_of_Ross|Earl_Of_Ross|  and Lord Ardmannoch.     James VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen  |Elizabeth_I_of_England|Elizabeth_I_Of_England| , and when she died childless in March 1603, he became  |King_of_England|King_Of_England|  as James  I. Charles was a weak and sickly infant, and while his parents and older siblings left for  |England|England|  in April and early June that year, due to his fragile health, he remained in Scotland with his fathers friend  |Lord_Fyvie|Alexander_Seton,_1St_Earl_Of_Dunfermline| , appointed as his guardian.     By 1604, when Charles was three-and-a-half, he was able to walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and it was decided that he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend most of the rest of his life. ; . In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier  |Sir_Robert_Carey|Robert_Carey,_1St_Earl_Of_Monmouth| , who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help strengthen his weak ankles. His speech development was also slow, and he retained a stammer, or hesitant speech, for the rest of his life.          In January 1605, Charles was created  |Duke_of_York|Duke_Of_York| , as is customary in the case of the English sovereigns second son, and made a  |Knight_of_the_Bath|Knight_Of_The_Bath| .  |Thomas_Murray|Thomas_Murray| , a  |presbyterian|Presbyterianism|  Scot, was appointed as a tutor. ; . Charles learnt the usual subjects of classics, languages, mathematics and religion. In 1611, he was made a  |Knight_of_the_Garter|Knight_Of_The_Garter| .     Eventually, Charles apparently conquered his physical infirmity, which might have been caused by  |rickets|Rickets| . He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother,  |Henry_Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales|Henry_Frederick,_Prince_Of_Wales| , whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. ; . However, in early November 1612, Henry died at the age of 18 of what is suspected to have been  |typhoid|Typhoid|  . Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became  |heir_apparent|Heir_Apparent| . As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles . Four years later, in November 1616, he was created  |Prince_of_Wales|Prince_Of_Wales|  and  |Earl_of_Chester|Earl_Of_Chester| .       In 1613, Charless sister  |Elizabeth|Elizabeth_Of_Bohemia|  married  |Frederick_V,_Elector_Palatine|Frederick_V,_Elector_Palatine| , and moved to  |Heidelberg|Heidelberg| . In 1617, the  |Habsburg|House_Of_Habsburg| |Archduke_Ferdinand_of_Austria|Ferdinand_Ii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , a Catholic, was elected  |king_of_Bohemia|King_Of_Bohemia| . The following year, the  |Bohemians_rebelled|Bohemian_Revolt| ,  |defenestrating_the_Catholic_governors|Defenestrations_Of_Praguesecond_Defenestration_Of_Prague| . In August 1619, the Bohemian  |diet|Diet|  chose as their monarch Frederick  V, who was leader of the  |Protestant_Union|Protestant_Union| , while Ferdinand was elected  |Holy_Roman_Emperor|Holy_Roman_Emperor|  in the  |imperial_election|Imperial_Election_Of_1619| . Fredericks acceptance of the Bohemian crown in defiance of the emperor marked the beginning of the turmoil that would develop into the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| . The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the  |English_Parliament|Parliament_Of_England|  and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. ; . In 1620, Charless brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the  |Battle_of_White_Mountain|Battle_Of_White_Mountain|  near  |Prague|Prague|  and his hereditary lands in the  |Electoral_Palatinate|Electoral_Palatinate|  were  |invaded_by_a_Habsburg_force|Palatinate_Campaign|  from the  |Spanish_Netherlands|Spanish_Netherlands| . ; ; . James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinands niece, Habsburg princess  |Maria_Anna_of_Spain|Maria_Anna_Of_Spain| , and began to see the  |Spanish_match|Spanish_Match|  as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe. ; .     Unfortunately for James, negotiation with Spain proved generally unpopular, both with the public and with Jamess court. The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism, and thus, when called by James in 1621, the members hoped for an enforcement of  |recusancy|Recusancy|  laws, a naval campaign against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales. ; . Jamess  |Lord_Chancellor|Lord_Chancellor| ,  |Francis_Bacon|Francis_Bacon| , was impeached before the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords|  for corruption. The  |impeachment|Impeachment|  was the first since 1459 without the kings official sanction in the form of a  |bill_of_attainder|Bill_Of_Attainder| . The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters:  |the_Duke_of_Buckingham|George_Villiers,_1St_Duke_Of_Buckingham| ,  |Archbishop_William_Laud|William_Laud| , and  |the_Earl_of_Strafford|Thomas_Wentworth,_1St_Earl_Of_Strafford| . James insisted that the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_England|  be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs, while the members protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons walls, demanding war with Spain and a Protestant Princess of Wales. Charles, like his father, considered the discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his fathers  |royal_prerogative|Royal_Prerogative| . In January 1622, James dissolved Parliament, angry at what he perceived as the members impudence and intransigence. ; .          Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, Jamess favourite and a man who had great influence over the prince, ; . travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. ; ; ; . In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. ; ; . The Infanta thought Charles was little more than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the  |penal_laws|Penal_Law| , which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the  |Count_of_Olivares|Gaspar_De_Guzmán,_Count-Duke_Of_Olivares| , the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. ; . When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, ; ; ; ; ; . he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain. ; ; ; .     With the encouragement of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 so that he could request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the  |Lord_Treasurer|Lord_Treasurer| ,  |Lionel_Cranfield,_1st_Earl_of_Middlesex|Lionel_Cranfield,_1St_Earl_Of_Middlesex| , who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. ; ; . An under-funded makeshift army under  |Ernst_von_Mansfeld|Ernst_Von_Mansfeld|  set off to recover the Palatinate, but it was so poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast. ; ; ; .     By 1624, James was growing ill, and as a result was finding it difficult to control Parliament. By the time of his death in March 1625, Charles and the Duke of Buckingham had already assumed de facto control of the kingdom.         With the failure of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their attention to France. ; ; . On 1 May 1625  Charles was  |married_by_proxy|Married_By_Proxy|  to the fifteen-year-old French princess  |Henrietta_Maria|Henrietta_Maria|  in front of the doors of the  |Notre_Dame_de_Paris|Notre_Dame_De_Paris| . ; ; . Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. ; . The married couple met in person on 13 June 1625 in  |Canterbury|Canterbury| . Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the marriage was consummated, to forestall any opposition. . Many members of the Commons were opposed to the kings marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| . Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law  |Louis_XIII_of_France|Louis_Xiii_Of_France| . Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at  |La_Rochelle|La_Rochelle|  in September 1625. Charles was  |crowned|Coronation_Of_The_British_Monarch|  on 2 February 1626 at  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey| , but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony. ; ; .     Distrust of Charless religious policies increased with his support of a controversial  |anti-Calvinist|History_Of_Calvinist-Arminian_Debate|  ecclesiastic,  |Richard_Montagu|Richard_Montagu| , who was in disrepute among the  |Puritans|Puritan| . In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose , a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against  |Calvinist|Calvinist| |predestination|Predestination| , the doctrine that  |salvation|Salvation|  and  |damnation|Damnation|  were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as  |Arminians|Arminians|  – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines had been one of the few sources of support for Charless proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled  Appello Caesarem , in 1625 shortly after the old kings death and Charless accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.     Rather than direct involvement in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the  |New_World|New_World| , hoping for the capture of the  |Spanish_treasure_fleets|Spanish_Treasure_Fleet| . Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, which was an insufficient sum for Charless war plans. ; . Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of  |tonnage_and_poundage|Tonnage_And_Poundage|  to a period of one year, although previous sovereigns since  |Henry_VI|Henry_Vi_Of_England|  had been granted the right for life. ; . In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue. ; . The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its  |first_reading|First_Reading| . Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of tonnage and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.      A poorly conceived and executed  |naval_expedition_against_Spain|Cadiz_Expedition|  under the leadership of Buckingham went badly, and the House of Commons began proceedings for the impeachment of the duke. ; ; ; . In May 1626, Charles nominated Buckingham as  |Chancellor_of_Cambridge_University|Chancellor_Of_Cambridge_University|  in a show of support, and had two members who had spoken against Buckingham –  |Dudley_Digges|Dudley_Digges|  and  |Sir_John_Eliot|John_Eliot|  – arrested at the door of the House. The Commons was outraged by the imprisonment of two of their members, and after about a week in custody, both were released. ; . On 12 June 1626, the Commons launched a direct protestation attacking Buckingham, stating,   We protest before your Majesty and the whole world that until this great person be removed from intermeddling with the great affairs of state, we are out of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given.  Despite Parliaments protests, however, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead. ; .     Meanwhile, domestic quarrels between Charles and Henrietta Maria were souring the early years of their marriage. Disputes over her  |jointure|Jointure| , appointments to her household, and the practice of her religion culminated in the king expelling the vast majority of her French attendants in August 1626. ; ; . Despite Charless agreement to provide the French with English ships as a condition of marrying Henrietta Maria, in 1627 he launched  |an_attack_on_the_French_coast|Siege_Of_Saint-Martin-De-Ré|  to defend the Huguenots at La Rochelle. The action, led by Buckingham, was ultimately unsuccessful. Buckinghams failure to protect the Huguenots – and his retreat from  |Saint-Martin-de-Ré|Saint-Martin-De-Ré|  – spurred Louis XIIIs  |siege_of_La_Rochelle|Siege_Of_La_Rochelle|  and furthered the English Parliaments and peoples detestation of the duke.     Charles provoked further unrest by trying to raise money for the war through a forced loan : a tax levied without parliamentary consent. In November 1627, the test case in the  |Kings_Bench|Kings_Bench| , the  |Five_Knights_Case|Five_Knights_Case|  , found that the king had a prerogative right to imprison without trial those who refused to pay the forced loan. ; . Summoned again in March 1628, on 26 May Parliament adopted a  |Petition_of_Right|Petition_Of_Right| , calling upon the king to acknowledge that he could not levy taxes without Parliaments consent, not impose martial law on civilians, not imprison them without due process, and not quarter troops in their homes. Charles assented to the petition on 7 June, ; ; . but by the end of the month he had prorogued Parliament and re-asserted his right to collect customs duties without authorisation from Parliament. ; ; .     On 23 August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated. ; ; ; . Charles was deeply distressed. According to  |Edward_Hyde,_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon|Edward_Hyde,_1St_Earl_Of_Clarendon| , he threw himself upon his bed, lamenting with much passion and with abundance of tears . Quoted in . He remained grieving in his room for two days. ; . In contrast, the public rejoiced at Buckinghams death, which accentuated the gulf between the court and the nation, and between the Crown and the Commons. ; . Although the death of Buckingham effectively ended the war with Spain and eliminated his leadership as an issue, it did not end the conflicts between Charles and Parliament. ; . It did, however, coincide with an improvement in Charless relationship with his wife, and by November 1628 their old quarrels were at an end. ; ; . Perhaps Charless emotional ties were transferred from Buckingham to Henrietta Maria. ; . She became pregnant for the first time, and the bond between them grew stronger. ; ; . Together, they embodied an image of virtue and family life, and their court became a model of formality and morality. ; .              In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been  |prorogued|Prorogued|  in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charless policies in light of the case of  |John_Rolle|John_Rolle| , a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, ; ; . members held the Speaker,  |Sir_John_Finch|John_Finch,_1St_Baron_Finch| , down in his chair so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. ; ; . The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, ; ; . thereby turning the men into martyrs, ; . and giving popular cause to their protest.     Shortly after the prorogation, without the means in the foreseeable future to raise funds from Parliament for a European war, or the influence of Buckingham, Charles made  |peace_with_France|Treaty_Of_Suza|  and Spain. ; ; ; . The following eleven years, during which Charles ruled England without a Parliament, are referred to as the  |personal_rule|Personal_Rule_Of_Charles_I|  or the eleven years tyranny . ; . Ruling without Parliament was not exceptional, and was supported by precedent. Only Parliament, however, could legally raise taxes, and without it Charless capacity to acquire funds for his treasury was limited to his customary rights and prerogatives.             A large fiscal deficit had arisen in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Notwithstanding Buckinghams short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, there was little financial capacity for Charles to wage wars overseas. Throughout his reign Charles was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister, Elizabeth, and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate. England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation. To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the Distraint of Knighthood , in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the kings coronation to be knighted. Relying on this old statute, Charles fined individuals who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626. ; .      The chief tax imposed by Charles was a feudal levy known as  |ship_money|Ship_Money| , ; . which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than tonnage and poundage before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, argued that there was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. ; . Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the kings prerogative, though some of them had reservations. ; . The prosecution of  |John_Hampden|John_Hampden|  for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges found against Hampden only by the narrow margin of 7–5. ; ; .     The king also derived money through the granting of monopolies, despite a  |statute_forbidding_such_action|Statute_Of_Monopolies| , which, though inefficient, raised an estimated £100,000 a year in the late 1630s. One such monopoly was for soap, pejoratively referred to as  |popish_soap|Popish_Soap|  because some of its backers were Catholics. Charles also raised funds from the Scottish nobility, at the price of considerable acrimony, by the Act of Revocation , whereby all gifts of royal or church land made to the nobility since 1540 were revoked, with continued ownership being subject to an annual rent. ; ; ; . In addition, the boundaries of the  |royal_forests|Royal_Forest|  in England were restored to their ancient limits as part of a scheme to maximise income by exploiting the land and fining land users within the reasserted boundaries for encroachment. ; ; ; . The focus of the programme was disafforestation and sale of forest lands for conversion to pasture and arable farming, or in the case of the  |Forest_of_Dean|Forest_Of_Dean| , development for the iron industry. Disafforestation frequently caused riots and disturbances including those known as the  |Western_Rising|Western_Rising_And_Disafforestation_Riots| .     Against the background of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in mid-1640. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, refused to make any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the  |mint|Royal_Mint|  in the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London| , promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners. In August, after the  |East_India_Company|East_India_Company|  refused to grant a loan,  |Lord_Cottington|Lord_Cottington|  seized the companys stock of pepper and spices and sold it for £60,000 , promising to refund the money with interest later.          Throughout Charless reign, the issue of how far the  |English_Reformation|English_Reformation|  should progress was constantly in the forefront of political debate.  |Arminian|Arminianism|  theology emphasised clerical authority and the individuals ability to reject or accept salvation, which opponents viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism.  |Puritan|Puritan|  reformers thought Charles was too sympathetic to the teachings of Arminianism, which they considered irreligious, and opposed his desire to move the Church of England in a more traditional and sacramental direction. In addition, his Protestant subjects followed the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charless diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.     In 1633, Charles appointed  |William_Laud|William_Laud| |Archbishop_of_Canterbury|Archbishop_Of_Canterbury| . They initiated a series of reforms aimed at ensuring religious uniformity by restricting non-conformist preachers, insisting the  |liturgy|Liturgy|  be celebrated as prescribed by the  |Book_of_Common_Prayer|Book_Of_Common_Prayer| , organising the internal architecture of English churches to emphasise the sacrament of the altar, and re-issuing King Jamess  |Declaration_of_Sports|Declaration_Of_Sports| , which permitted secular activities on the sabbath. ; ; ; . The  |Feoffees_for_Impropriations|Feoffees_For_Impropriations| , an organisation that bought  |benefices|Benefice|  and  |advowsons|Advowson|  so that Puritans could be appointed to them, was dissolved. ; . Laud prosecuted those who opposed his reforms in the  |Court_of_High_Commission|Court_Of_High_Commission|  and the  |Star_Chamber|Star_Chamber| , the two most powerful courts in the land. The courts became feared for their censorship of opposing religious views and unpopular among the propertied classes for inflicting degrading punishments on gentlemen. ; ; ; . For example, in 1637  |William_Prynne|William_Prynne| ,  |Henry_Burton|Henry_Burton|  and  |John_Bastwick|John_Bastwick|  were  |pilloried|Pillory| , whipped and mutilated by  |cropping|Cropping|  and imprisoned indefinitely for publishing anti-episcopal pamphlets. ; .          When Charles attempted to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom; his first visit since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633. ; . To the dismay of the Scots, who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice, Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted using the  |Anglican|Anglican|  rite. ; . In 1637, the king ordered the use of a new prayer book in Scotland that was almost identical to the English Book of Common Prayer, without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the  |Kirk|Kirk| . ; ; ; . Although it had been written, under Charless direction, by Scottish bishops, many Scots resisted it, seeing the new prayer book as a vehicle for introducing Anglicanism to Scotland. ; . On 23 July,  |riots|Jenny_Geddes|  erupted in Edinburgh upon the first Sunday of the prayer books usage, and unrest spread throughout the Kirk. The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the  |National_Covenant|National_Covenant| , whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations that were not authorised by Kirk and Parliament. ; ; ; . When the  |General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland|General_Assembly_Of_The_Church_Of_Scotland|  met in November 1638, it condemned the new prayer book, abolished  |episcopal_church_government|Episcopal_Polity|  by bishops, and adopted  |presbyterian|Presbyterian_Polity|  government by elders and deacons.          Charles perceived the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the  |First_Bishops_War|Bishops_Wars|  in 1639. ; ; . Charles did not seek subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war, but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to  |Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick-Upon-Tweed| , on the border of Scotland. ; ; . Charless army did not engage the  |Covenanters|Covenanter|  as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. ; ; . In the  |Treaty_of_Berwick|Treaty_Of_Berwick| , Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called. ; .     The military failure in the First Bishops War caused a financial and diplomatic crisis for Charles that deepened when his efforts to raise funds from Spain, while simultaneously continuing his support for his Palatine relatives, led to the public humiliation of the  |Battle_of_the_Downs|Battle_Of_The_Downs| , where the Dutch destroyed a Spanish bullion fleet off the coast of Kent in sight of the impotent English navy. ; .     Charles continued peace negotiations with the Scots in a bid to gain time before launching a new military campaign. Because of his financial weakness, he was forced to call Parliament into session in an attempt to raise funds for such a venture. ; . Both English and  |Irish_parliaments|Parliament_Of_Ireland|  were summoned in the early months of 1640. In March 1640, the Irish Parliament duly voted in a subsidy of £180,000 with the promise to raise an army 9,000 strong by the end of May. In the English general election in March, however, court candidates fared badly, and Charless dealings with the English Parliament in April quickly reached stalemate. The earls of  |Northumberland|Algernon_Percy,_10Th_Earl_Of_Northumberland|  and  |Strafford|Thomas_Wentworth,_1St_Earl_Of_Strafford|  attempted to broker a compromise whereby the king would agree to forfeit ship money in exchange for £650,000 . Nevertheless, this alone was insufficient to produce consensus in the Commons. The Parliamentarians calls for further reforms were ignored by Charles, who still retained the support of the House of Lords. Despite the protests of Northumberland, the  |Short_Parliament|Short_Parliament|  was dissolved in May 1640, less than a month after it assembled. ; ; ; .      By this stage Strafford,  |Lord_Deputy_of_Ireland|Lord_Deputy_Of_Ireland|  since 1632, had emerged as Charless right-hand man and together with Laud, pursued a policy of  |Thorough|Thorough|  that aimed to make central royal authority more efficient and effective at the expense of local or anti-government interests. ; . Although originally a critic of the king, Strafford defected to royal service in 1628 , and had since emerged, alongside Laud, as the most influential of Charless ministers.     Bolstered by the failure of the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament declared itself capable of governing without the kings consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into the English county of  |Northumberland|Northumberland| . Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the kings commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill himself with a combination of gout and dysentery. ; . The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching  |Newcastle_upon_Tyne|Newcastle_Upon_Tyne| , where they defeated the English forces at the  |Battle_of_Newburn|Battle_Of_Newburn|  and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of  |Durham|County_Durham| . ; .     As demands for a parliament grew, ; . Charles took the unusual step of summoning a  |great_council_of_peers|Great_Council_Of_Peers| . By the time it met, on 24 September at  |York|York| , Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he asked them to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. ; ; . A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating   |Treaty_of_Ripon|Treaty_Of_Ripon| , signed in October 1640. ; . The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. ; . Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the  |Long_Parliament|Long_Parliament| . Once again, Charless supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king. ; .                 The Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the kings leading counsellors of high treason. Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, now  |Lord_Keeper_of_the_Great_Seal|Lord_Keeper_Of_The_Great_Seal| , was impeached the following day, and he consequently fled to  |the_Hague|The_Hague|  with Charless permission on 21 December. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the  |Triennial_Act|Triennial_Act| , which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. ; . The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted  |royal_assent|Royal_Assent|  in February 1641. ; .     Strafford had become the principal target of the Parliamentarians, particularly  |John_Pym|John_Pym| , and he went on trial for high treason on 22 March 1641. ; . However, the key allegation by  |Sir_Henry_Vane|Henry_Vane_The_Elder|  that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army to subdue England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pyms case collapsed. ; ; . Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death. ;  and  assume that Pym was involved with the launch of the bill; , quoting and agreeing with Gardiner, suspects that it was initiated by Pyms allies only.      Charles assured Strafford that upon the word of a king you shall not suffer in life, honour or fortune , ; ; . and the attainder could not succeed if Charles withheld assent. Furthermore, many members and most peers were opposed to the attainder, not wishing, in the words of one, to commit murder with the sword of justice . ; see also  and . However, increased tensions and an attempted coup by royalist army officers in support of Strafford and in which Charles was involved began to sway the issue. ;  The Commons passed the bill on 20 April by a large margin , and the Lords acquiesced in May. On 3 May, Parliaments  |Protestation|Protestation_Of_1641|  attacked the wicked counsels of Charless arbitrary and tyrannical government ; while those who signed the petition undertook to defend the kings person, honour and estate , they also swore to preserve the true reformed religion , parliament, and the rights and liberties of the subjects . Charles, fearing for the safety of his family in the face of unrest, assented reluctantly to Straffords attainder on 9 May after consulting his judges and bishops. ; ; ; . Strafford was beheaded three days later. ; ; .     Additionally in early May, Charles assented to an unprecedented Act that forbade the dissolution of the English Parliament without its consent. ; . In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. ; . All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.     Charles had made important concessions in England, and temporarily improved his position in Scotland by securing the favour of the Scots on a visit from August to November 1641 during which he conceded to the official establishment of presbyterianism. ; . However, following an attempted royalist coup in Scotland, known as  |The_Incident|The_Incident|  , Charless credibility was significantly undermined. ; ; .             In Ireland, the population was split into three main socio-political groups: the  |Gaelic_Irish|Gaelic_Ireland| , who were Catholic; the  |Old_English|Old_English| , who were descended from  |medieval_Normans|Norman_Invasion_Of_Ireland|  and were also predominantly Catholic; and the  |New_English|Plantations_Of_Ireland| , who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Straffords administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. ; . He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. ; . Straffords impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.     Straffords fall from power weakened Charless influence in Ireland. ; . The dissolution of the Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Straffords imprisonment, until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army at the end of Straffords trial. Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant, particularly in relation to the  |plantation_of_Ulster|Plantation_Of_Ulster| , ; . coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England, ; . sowed the seeds of rebellion. When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English, in late October 1641, the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king.     In November 1641, the House of Commons passed the  |Grand_Remonstrance|Grand_Remonstrance| , a long list of grievances against actions by Charless ministers committed since the beginning of his reign , but it was in many ways a step too far by Pym and passed by only 11 votes – 159 to 148. ; ; ; . Furthermore, the Remonstrance had very little support in the House of Lords, which the Remonstrance attacked. ; . The tension was heightened by news of the Irish rebellion, coupled with inaccurate rumours of Charless complicity. Throughout November, a series of alarmist pamphlets published stories of atrocities in Ireland, ; . which included massacres of New English settlers by the native Irish who could not be controlled by the Old English lords. ; . Rumours of papist conspiracies circulated in England, ; . and English anti-Catholic opinion was strengthened, damaging Charless reputation and authority.   The English Parliament distrusted Charless motivations when he called for funds to put down the Irish rebellion; many members of the Commons suspected that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself. Pyms  |Militia_Bill|Militia_Bill|  was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles. Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent. The  |Militia_Ordinance|Militia_Ordinance|  appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king. In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into lawlessness, when he placed the  |Tower_of_London|Tower_Of_London|  under the command of Colonel  |Thomas_Lunsford|Thomas_Lunsford| , an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer. When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, the king decided to take drastic action. ; ; ; ; .          Charles suspected, probably correctly, that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots. On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up  |five_members|Five_Members|  of the Commons – Pym,  |John_Hampden|John_Hampden| ,  |Denzil_Holles|Denzil_Holles,_1St_Baron_Holles| ,  |William_Strode|William_Strode|  and  |Sir_Arthur_Haselrig|Arthur_Haselrig|  – and one peer –  |Lord_Mandeville|Edward_Montagu,_2Nd_Earl_Of_Manchester|  – on the grounds of high treason. ; ; . When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which Charles intended to carry out personally. ; ; ; . However, news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January. ; ; . Having displaced the Speaker,  |William_Lenthall|William_Lenthall| , from his chair, the king asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees, ; . famously replied, May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.  Charles abjectly declared all my birds have flown , and was forced to retire, empty-handed.     The botched arrest attempt was politically disastrous for Charles. ; . No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented invasion of the chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.     Parliament quickly seized London, and Charles fled the capital for  |Hampton_Court_Palace|Hampton_Court_Palace|  on 10 January, ; . moving two days later to  |Windsor_Castle|Windsor_Castle| . ; . After sending his wife and eldest daughter to safety abroad in February, he travelled northwards, hoping to seize the military arsenal at  |Hull|Kingston_Upon_Hull| . ; . To his dismay, he was  |rebuffed_by_the_towns_Parliamentary_governor|Siege_Of_Hull| ,  |Sir_John_Hotham|Sir_John_Hotham,_1St_Baronet| , who refused him entry in April, and Charles was forced to withdraw. ; ; .               In mid-1642, both sides began to arm. Charles raised an army using the medieval method of  |commission_of_array|Commission_Of_Array| , and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia. Following futile negotiations, Charles raised the royal standard in  |Nottingham|Nottingham|  on 22 August 1642. ; ; . At the start of the  |First_English_Civil_War|First_English_Civil_War| , Charless forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England. He set up his court at  |Oxford|Oxford| . Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy.     After a few skirmishes, the opposing forces met in earnest at  |Edgehill|Battle_Of_Edgehill| , on 23 October 1642. Charless nephew  |Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine|Prince_Rupert_Of_The_Rhine|  disagreed with the battle strategy of the royalist commander  |Lord_Lindsey|Robert_Bertie,_1St_Earl_Of_Lindsey| , and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by  |Lord_Forth|Patrick_Ruthven,_1St_Earl_Of_Forth| . Ruperts cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.     In his own words, the experience of battle had left Charles exceedingly and deeply grieved . He regrouped at Oxford, turning down Ruperts suggestion of an immediate attack on London. After a week, he set out for the capital on 3 November,  |capturing_Brentford|Battle_Of_Brentford|  on the way while simultaneously continuing to negotiate with civic and parliamentary delegations. At  |Turnham_Green|Battle_Of_Turnham_Green|  on the outskirts of London, the royalist army met resistance from the city militia, and faced with a numerically superior force, Charles ordered a retreat. He overwintered in Oxford, strengthening the citys defences and preparing for the next seasons campaign.  |Peace_talks|Treaty_Of_Oxford|  between the two sides collapsed in April. ;       The war continued indecisively over the next couple of years, and Henrietta Maria returned to Britain for 17 months from February 1643. ; . After Rupert  |captured_Bristol|Storming_Of_Bristol|  in July 1643, Charles visited the port city and laid  |siege_to_Gloucester|Siege_Of_Gloucester| , further up the  |river_Severn|River_Severn| . His plan to undermine the city walls failed due to heavy rain, and on the approach of a parliamentary relief force, Charles lifted the siege and withdrew to  |Sudeley_Castle|Sudeley_Castle| . The parliamentary army turned back towards London, and Charles set off in pursuit. The two armies met at  |Newbury,_Berkshire|Newbury,_Berkshire| , on 20 September. Just as at Edgehill, the  |battle|First_Battle_Of_Newbury|  stalemated at nightfall, and the armies disengaged. In January 1644, Charles summoned a Parliament at Oxford, which was attended by about 40 peers and 118 members of the Commons; all told, the  |Oxford_Parliament|Oxford_Parliament| , which sat until March 1645, was supported by the majority of peers and about a third of the Commons. Charles became disillusioned by the assemblys ineffectiveness, calling it a mongrel in private letters to his wife. ;      In 1644, Charles remained in the southern half of England while Rupert rode north to  |relieve_Newark|Relief_Of_Newark|  and  |York|Siege_Of_York| , which were under threat from parliamentary and Scottish Covenanter armies. Charles was victorious at the  |battle_of_Cropredy_Bridge|Battle_Of_Cropredy_Bridge|  in late June, but the royalists in the north were defeated at the  |battle_of_Marston_Moor|Battle_Of_Marston_Moor|  just a few days later. The king continued his  |campaign_in_the_south|Battle_Of_Lostwithiel| , encircling and disarming the parliamentary army of the  |Earl_of_Essex|Robert_Devereux,_3Rd_Earl_Of_Essex| . ; ;  Returning northwards to his base at Oxford, he fought at  |Newbury_for_a_second_time|Second_Battle_Of_Newbury|  before the winter closed in; the battle ended indecisively. Attempts to negotiate a settlement over the winter, while both sides re-armed and re-organised, were again unsuccessful. ;      At the  |battle_of_Naseby|Battle_Of_Naseby|  on 14 June 1645, Ruperts horsemen again mounted a successful charge against the flank of Parliaments  |New_Model_Army|New_Model_Army| , but Charless troops elsewhere on the field were pushed back by the opposing forces. Charles, attempting to rally his men, rode forward but as he did so,  |Lord_Carnwath|Robert_Dalzell,_1St_Earl_Of_Carnwath|  seized his bridle and pulled him back, fearing for the kings safety. Carnwaths action was misinterpreted by the royalist soldiers as a signal to move back, leading to a collapse of their position. ;  The military balance tipped decisively in favour of Parliament. ; ; . There followed a series of defeats for the royalists, ; ; ; . and then the  |Siege_of_Oxford|Siege_Of_Oxford| ,  |from_which_Charles_escaped|Charles_Is_Journey_From_Oxford_To_The_Scottish_Army_Camp_Near_Newark|  in April 1646. ; ; . He put himself into the hands of the Scottish presbyterian army besieging  |Newark|Newark,_England| , and was taken northwards to  |Newcastle_upon_Tyne|Newcastle_Upon_Tyne| . ; ; . After nine months of negotiations, the Scots finally arrived at an agreement with the English Parliament: in exchange for £100,000, and the promise of more money in the future, the Scots withdrew from Newcastle and delivered Charles to the parliamentary commissioners in January 1647.          Parliament held Charles under house arrest at  |Holdenby_House|Holdenby_House|  in Northamptonshire until Cornet  |George_Joyce|George_Joyce|  took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army. ; ; . By this time, mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by  |congregationalist|Congregationalist_Polity| |Independents|Independent| , who sought a greater political role. ; ; . Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions, and apparently viewed Joyces actions as an opportunity rather than a threat. He was taken first to  |Newmarket|Newmarket,_Suffolk| , at his own suggestion, ; . and then transferred to  |Oatlands|Oatlands_Palace|  and subsequently  |Hampton_Court|Hampton_Court_Palace| , while more  |ultimately_fruitless_negotiations|Heads_Of_Proposals|  took place. By November, he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape – perhaps to France, Southern England or to  |Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick-Upon-Tweed| , near the Scottish border. He fled Hampton Court on 11 November, and from the shores of  |Southampton_Water|Southampton_Water|  made contact with Colonel  |Robert_Hammond|Robert_Hammond| , Parliamentary Governor of the  |Isle_of_Wight|Isle_Of_Wight| , whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic. ; . Hammond, however, confined Charles in  |Carisbrooke_Castle|Carisbrooke_Castle|  and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody.     From Carisbrooke, Charles continued to try to bargain with the various parties. In direct contrast to his previous conflict with the Scottish Kirk, on 26 December 1647 he signed a secret treaty with the Scots. Under the agreement, called the  |Engagement|Engagers|  , the Scots undertook to invade England on Charless behalf and restore him to the throne on condition that presbyterianism be established in England for three years. ; .     The royalists rose in May 1648, igniting the  |Second_Civil_War|Second_English_Civil_War| , and as agreed with Charles, the Scots invaded England. Uprisings in  |Kent|Kent| ,  |Essex|Essex| , and  |Cumberland|Cumberland| , and a rebellion in South Wales, were put down by the New Model Army, and with the defeat of the Scots at the  |Battle_of_Preston|Battle_Of_Preston|  in August 1648, the royalists lost any chance of winning the war. ; .     Charless only recourse was to return to negotiations, which were held at  |Newport|Newport,_Isle_Of_Wight|  on the Isle of Wight. ; . On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king, ; . but  |Oliver_Cromwell|Oliver_Cromwell|  and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. ; . Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, and placed in the custody of the army the following day. In  |Prides_Purge|Prides_Purge|  on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel  |Thomas_Pride|Thomas_Pride| , ; . while others stayed away voluntarily. ; . The remaining members formed the  |Rump_Parliament|Rump_Parliament| . It was effectively a military coup. ; ; .               Charles was moved to  |Hurst_Castle|Hurst_Castle|  at the end of 1648, and thereafter to  |Windsor_Castle|Windsor_Castle| . ; ; . In January 1649, the Rump House of Commons indicted him on a charge of treason, which was rejected by the House of Lords. ; ; . The idea of trying a king was a novel one. The Chief Justices of the three common law courts of England –  |Henry_Rolle|Henry_Rolle| ,  |Oliver_St_John|Oliver_St_John|  and  |John_Wilde|John_Wilde|  – all opposed the indictment as unlawful. The Rump Commons declared itself capable of legislating alone, passed a bill creating a separate court for Charless trial, and declared the bill an act without the need for royal assent. ; ; . The High Court of Justice established by the Act consisted of 135 commissioners, but many either refused to serve or chose to stay away. Only 68 attended Charless trial on charges of high treason and other high crimes that began on 20 January 1649 in  |Westminster_Hall|Palace_Of_Westminsterwestminster_Hall| . ; .  |John_Bradshaw|John_Bradshaw|  acted as President of the Court, and the  |prosecution|Prosecutor|  was led by the  |Solicitor_General|Solicitor_General_For_England_And_Wales| ,  |John_Cook|John_Cook| . ; .          Charles was accused of treason against England by using his power to pursue his personal interest rather than the good of the country. The charge stated that he, for accomplishment of such his designs, and for the protecting of himself and his adherents in his and their wicked practices, to the same ends hath traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented , and that the wicked designs, wars, and evil practices of him, the said Charles Stuart, have been, and are carried on for the advancement and upholding of a personal interest of will, power, and pretended prerogative to himself and his family, against the public interest, common right, liberty, justice, and peace of the people of this nation.  Reflecting the modern concept of  |command_responsibility|Command_Responsibility| , the indictment held him guilty of all the treasons, murders, rapines, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to this nation, acted and committed in the said wars, or occasioned thereby. ; ; . An estimated 300,000 people, or 6% of the population, died during the war.     Over the first three days of the trial, whenever Charles was asked to plead, he refused, ; ; . stating his objection with the words: I would know by what power I am called hither, by what lawful authority...? ; . He claimed that no court had jurisdiction over a monarch, that his own authority to rule had been  |given_to_him_by_God|Divine_Right_Of_Kings|  and by the traditional laws of England, and that the power wielded by those trying him was only that of force of arms. Charles insisted that the trial was illegal, explaining that,  The court, by contrast, challenged the doctrine of  |sovereign_immunity|Sovereign_Immunity|  and proposed that the King of England was not a person, but an office whose every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise.       At the end of the third day, Charles was removed from the court, ; . which then heard over 30 witnesses against the king in his absence over the next two days, and on 26 January condemned him to death. The following day, the king was brought before a public session of the commission, declared guilty, and sentenced.  |Fifty-nine_of_the_commissioners|List_Of_Regicides_Of_Charles_I|  signed Charless death warrant. ; .             Charless  |beheading|Decapitation|  was scheduled for Tuesday, 30 January 1649. Two of his children remained in England under the control of the Parliamentarians:  |Elizabeth|Elizabeth_Stuart|  and  |Henry|Henry_Stuart,_Duke_Of_Gloucester| . They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell. ; ; . The following morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: . ; . the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear. I would have no such imputation.     He walked under guard from  |St_Jamess_Palace|St_Jamess_Palace| , where he had been confined, to the  |Palace_of_Whitehall|Palace_Of_Whitehall| , where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the  |Banqueting_House|Banqueting_House,_Whitehall| . ; . Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. ; ; ; ; . He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: An unjust sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me. ; ; ; . He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government  ... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things. ; see also a virtually identical quote in . He continued, I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be. ; ; ; .     At about 2:00  p.m., ; ; . Charles put his head on the block after saying a prayer and signalled the executioner when he was ready by stretching out his hands; he was then beheaded with one clean stroke. ; . According to observer  |Philip_Henry|Philip_Henry| , a moan as I never heard before and desire I may never hear again rose from the assembled crowd, some of whom then dipped their handkerchiefs in the kings blood as a memento. ; ; .          The executioner was masked and disguised, and there is debate over his identity.  The commissioners approached  |Richard_Brandon|Richard_Brandon| , the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200.  It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, but there are others who have been named as potential candidates, including  |George_Joyce|George_Joyce| ,  |William_Hulet|William_Hewlett|  and  |Hugh_Peters|Hugh_Peters| . The clean strike, confirmed by an examination of the kings body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.     It was common practice for the severed head of a traitor to be held up and exhibited to the crowd with the words Behold the head of a traitor!  Although Charless head was exhibited, ; . the words were not used, possibly because the executioner did not want his voice recognised. On the day after the execution, the kings head was sewn back onto his body, which was then embalmed and placed in a lead coffin.     The commission refused to allow Charless burial at  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey| , so his body was conveyed to Windsor on the night of 7 February. ; . He was buried in private on 9 February 1649 in the Henry VIII vault in the chapels quire, alongside the coffins of  |Henry_VIII|Henry_Viii|  and Henrys third wife,  |Jane_Seymour|Jane_Seymour| , in  |St_Georges_Chapel,_Windsor_Castle|St_Georges_Chapel,_Windsor_Castle| . ; . The kings son,  |Charles_II|Charles_Ii_Of_England| , later planned for an elaborate royal mausoleum to be erected in  |Hyde_Park,_London|Hyde_Park,_London| , but it was never built.          Ten days after Charless execution, on the day of his interment, a memoir purporting to be written by the king appeared for sale. This book, the  Eikon Basilike  , contained an apologia for royal policies, and it proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda.  |John_Milton|John_Milton|  wrote a Parliamentary rejoinder, the  Eikonoklastes  , but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book. ; . Anglicans and royalists fashioned an image of martyrdom, and in the  |Convocations_of_Canterbury_and_York|Convocations_Of_Canterbury_And_York|  of 1660  |King_Charles_the_Martyr|King_Charles_The_Martyr|  was added to the  |Church_of_Englands_liturgical_calendar|Calendar_Of_Saints| .  |High_church|High_Church|  Anglicans held special services on the anniversary of his death. Churches, such as those at  |Falmouth|Church_Of_King_Charles_The_Martyr,_Falmouth|  and  |Tunbridge_Wells|Church_Of_King_Charles_The_Martyr,_Royal_Tunbridge_Wells| , and Anglican devotional societies such as the  |Society_of_King_Charles_the_Martyr|Society_Of_King_Charles_The_Martyr| , were founded in his honour.     With the monarchy overthrown, England became a republic or  |Commonwealth|Commonwealth_Of_England|  . The House of Lords was abolished by the Rump Commons, and executive power was assumed by a  |Council_of_State|English_Council_Of_State| . ; . All significant military opposition in Britain and Ireland was extinguished by the forces of  |Oliver_Cromwell|Oliver_Cromwell|  in the  |Third_English_Civil_War|Third_English_Civil_War|  and the  |Cromwellian_conquest_of_Ireland|Cromwellian_Conquest_Of_Ireland| . ; ; . Cromwell forcibly disbanded the Rump Parliament in 1653, ; ; . thereby establishing  |the_Protectorate|The_Protectorate|  with himself as  |Lord_Protector|Lord_Protector| . ; . Upon his death in 1658, he was briefly succeeded by his ineffective son,  |Richard|Richard_Cromwell| . ; ; . Parliament was reinstated, and the monarchy was  |restored|English_Restoration|  to Charles Is eldest son, Charles II, in 1660. ; .       Partly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623, ; . Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled. ; ; ; . In Spain, he sat for a sketch by  |Velázquez|Diego_Velázquez| , and acquired works by  |Titian|Titian|  and  |Correggio|Antonio_Da_Correggio| , among others. In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the  |Banqueting_House,_Whitehall|Banqueting_House,_Whitehall| , by  |Rubens|Peter_Paul_Rubens|  and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as  |van_Honthorst|Gerard_Van_Honthorst| ,  |Mytens|Daniel_Mytens| , and  |van_Dyck|Anthony_Van_Dyck| . ; . His close associates, including the  |Duke_of_Buckingham|George_Villiers,_1St_Duke_Of_Buckingham|  and the  |Earl_of_Arundel|Thomas_Howard,_21St_Earl_Of_Arundel| , shared his interest and have been dubbed the  |Whitehall_Group|Whitehall_Group| . In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the  |Duke_of_Mantua|Duke_Of_Mantua| , which included work by Titian, Correggio,  |Raphael|Raphael| ,  |Caravaggio|Caravaggio| ,  |del_Sarto|Andrea_Del_Sarto|  and  |Mantegna|Andrea_Mantegna| . ; see also ;  and . His collection grew further to encompass  |Bernini|Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini| ,  |Bruegel|Pieter_Bruegel_The_Elder| ,  |da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci| ,  |Holbein|Hans_Holbein_The_Younger| ,  |Hollar|Wenceslaus_Hollar| ,  |Tintoretto|Tintoretto|  and  |Veronese|Paolo_Veronese| , and self-portraits by both  |Dürer|Albrecht_Dürer|  and  |Rembrandt|Rembrandt| . By Charless death, there were an estimated 1,760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.       In the words of  |John_Philipps_Kenyon|John_Philipps_Kenyon| , Charles Stuart is a man of contradictions and controversy . Revered by  |high_Tories|High_Tories|  who considered him a saintly martyr, he was condemned by  |Whig_historians|Whig_History| , such as  |Samuel_Rawson_Gardiner|Samuel_Rawson_Gardiner| , who thought him duplicitous and delusional. ; . In recent decades, most historians have criticised him, ; ; . the main exception being  |Kevin_Sharpe|Kevin_Sharpe|  who offered a more sympathetic view of Charles that has not been widely adopted. ; ; . While Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience, Professor  |Barry_Coward|Barry_Coward|  thought Charles was the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI , a view shared by  |Ronald_Hutton|Ronald_Hutton| , who called him the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages . Quoted in      Archbishop  |William_Laud|William_Laud| , who was beheaded by Parliament during the war, described Charles as A mild and gracious prince who knew not how to be, or how to be made, great. Archbishop Laud, quoted by his chaplain  |Peter_Heylin|Peter_Heylin|  in Cyprianus Angelicus, 1688 Charles was more sober and refined than his father, ; . but he was intransigent. He deliberately pursued unpopular policies that ultimately brought ruin on himself. Both Charles and James were advocates of the  |divine_right_of_kings|Divine_Right_Of_Kings| , but while Jamess ambitions concerning  |absolute_prerogative|Absolutism|  were tempered by compromise and consensus with his subjects, Charles believed that he had no need to compromise or even to explain his actions. ; . He thought he was answerable only to God. Princes are not bound to give account of their actions, he wrote, but to God alone .             |style|Style|  of Charles I as king in England was Charles, by the Grace of God,  |King_of_England|King_Of_England| ,  |Scotland|List_Of_Scottish_Monarchs| ,  |France|British_Claims_To_The_French_Throne|  and  |Ireland|Kingdom_Of_Ireland| ,  |Defender_of_the_Faith|Defender_Of_The_Faith| , etc.  The style of France was only nominal, and was used by every English monarch from  |Edward_III|Edward_Iii|  to  |George_III|George_Iii| , regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled. The authors of his death warrant referred to him as Charles Stuart, King of England . ; .       KB |Knight_of_the_Bath|Order_Of_The_Bath| , 6 January 1605  – 27 March 1625 ; .

In Scotland, the Scottish arms were placed in the first and fourth quarters with the English and French arms in the second quarter.               Charles had nine children, two of whom eventually succeeded as king, and two of whom died at or shortly after birth.
