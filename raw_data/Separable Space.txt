In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a  |topological_space|Topological_Space|  is called separable if it contains a  |countable|Countable_Set| ,  |dense|Dense|  subset; that is, there exists a  |sequence|Sequence|    of elements of the space such that every nonempty  |open_subset|Open_Subset|  of the space contains at least one element of the sequence.     Like the other  |axioms_of_countability|Axioms_Of_Countability| , separability is a limitation on size , not necessarily in terms of  |cardinality|Cardinality|   but in a more subtle topological sense. In particular, every  |continuous_function|Continuous_Function|  on a separable space whose image is a subset of a Hausdorff space is determined by its values on the countable dense subset.     Contrast separability with the related notion of  |second_countability|Second_Countability| , which is in general stronger but equivalent on the class of  |metrizable|Metrizable|  spaces.       Any topological space that is itself  |finite|Finite_Set|  or  |countably_infinite|Countably_Infinite|  is separable, for the whole space is a countable dense subset of itself. An important example of an uncountable separable space is the  |real_line|Real_Line| , in which the  |rational_numbers|Rational_Numbers|  form a countable dense subset. Similarly the set of all vectors     in which ri is rational for all i is a countable dense subset of   ; so for every n the n -dimensional  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space|  is separable.     A simple example of a space that is not separable is a  |discrete_space|Discrete_Space|  of uncountable cardinality.     Further examples are given below.       Any  |second-countable_space|Second-Countable_Space|  is separable: if   is a countable base, choosing any xn   Un from the non-empty Un gives a countable dense subset. Conversely, a  |metrizable_space|Metrizable_Space|  is separable if and only if it is second countable, which is the case if and only if it is  |Lindelöf|Lindelöf_Space| .     To further compare these two properties:   An arbitrary  |subspace|Subspace|  of a second-countable space is second countable; subspaces of separable spaces need not be separable .   Any continuous image of a separable space is separable ; even a  |quotient|Quotient_Topology|  of a second-countable space need not be second countable.   A  |product|Product_Topology|  of at most continuum many separable spaces is separable . A countable product of second-countable spaces is second countable, but an uncountable product of second-countable spaces need not even be first countable.     We can construct an example of a separable topological space that is not second countable. Consider any uncountable set X , pick some x0   X , and define the topology to be the collection of all sets that contain x0 . Then, the closure of is the whole space , but every set of the form   is open. Therefore, the space is separable but there cannot be a countable base.       The property of separability does not in and of itself give any limitations on the  |cardinality|Cardinality|  of a topological space: any set endowed with the  |trivial_topology|Trivial_Topology|  is separable, as well as second countable,  |quasi-compact|Quasi-Compact| , and  |connected|Connected_Space| . The trouble with the trivial topology is its poor separation properties: its  |Kolmogorov_quotient|Kolmogorov_Quotient|  is the one-point space.     A  |first-countable|First-Countable| , separable Hausdorff space has at most the  |continuum_cardinality|Cardinality_Of_The_Continuum|    . In such a space,  |closure|Closure|  is determined by limits of sequences and any convergent sequence has at most one limit, so there is a surjective map from the set of convergent sequences with values in the countable dense subset to the points of X .     A separable Hausdorff space has cardinality at most 2  , where   is the cardinality of the continuum. For this closure is characterized in terms of limits of  |filter_bases|Filter_Filters_In_Topology| . In particular the space   of all functions from the real line to itself, endowed with the product topology, is a separable Hausdorff space of cardinality 2  . More generally, if   is any infinite cardinal, then a product of at most 2  spaces with dense subsets of size at most   has itself a dense subset of size at most   .       Separability is especially important in  |numerical_analysis|Numerical_Analysis|  and  |constructive_mathematics|Mathematical_Constructivism| , since many theorems that can be proved for nonseparable spaces have constructive proofs only for separable spaces. Such constructive proofs can be turned into  |algorithms|Algorithm|  for use in numerical analysis, and they are the only sorts of proofs acceptable in constructive analysis. A famous example of a theorem of this sort is the  |Hahn–Banach_theorem|Hahn–Banach_Theorem| .           Every compact  |metric_space|Metric_Space|  is separable.   Any topological space that is the union of a countable number of separable subspaces is separable. Together, these first two examples give a different proof that n -dimensional Euclidean space is separable.   The space C of all continuous functions from a  |compact|Compact_Space|  subset K  to the real line   is separable.   The  |Lebesgue_spaces|Lp_Space|  L  , over a  |separable_measure_space|Separable_Measure_Space|    X,  , are separable for any 1  p    .
