The intermediates can act as both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition.  The modifiers alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge to compensate for the positive ion nearby.  Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a network former , or as a modifier.
