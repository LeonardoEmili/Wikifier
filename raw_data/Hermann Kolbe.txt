Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe was a contributor in the birth of modern  |organic_chemistry|Organic_Chemistry| . He was a Professor at  |Marburg|University_Of_Marburg|  and  |Leipzig|Leipzig_University| . Kolbe coined the term  |synthesis|Chemical_Synthesis|  and contributed to the philosophical demise of  |vitalism|Vitalism|  through synthesis of the  |organic_substance|Organic_Chemical|  acetic acid from  |carbon_disulfide|Carbon_Disulfide| , and also contributed to the development of  |structural_theory|Structural_Theory| . This was done via modifications to the idea of radicals and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his  |Kolbe_electrolysis|Kolbe_Electrolysis|  of carboxylate salts, the  |Kolbe-Schmitt_reaction|Kolbe-Schmitt_Reaction|  in the preparation of  |aspirin|Aspirin|  and the  |Kolbe_nitrile_synthesis|Kolbe_Nitrile_Synthesis| . After studies with  |Wöhler|Friedrich_Wöhler|  and  |Bunsen|Robert_Bunsen| , Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London , and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the  |Journal_für_Praktische_Chemie|:De:Journal_Für_Praktische_Chemie| . As such, he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences won the  |Royal_Society_of_Londons|Royal_Society_Of_London|  Davy Medal in the year of his death. Despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists , Kolbe is remembered for editing the Journal for more than a decade, where his rejection of  |Kekulés|August_Kekulé|  structure of benzene,  |vant_Hoffs|Jacobus_Henricus_Van_T_Hoff|  theory on the origin of  |chirality|Chirality|  and  |von_Baeyers|Adolf_Von_Baeyer|  reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent. Kolbe died of a heart attack in  |Leipzig|Leipzig|  at age 68, six years after the death of his wife, Charlotte. He was survived by four children.         Kolbe was born in Elliehausen, near  |Göttingen|Göttingen| ,  |Kingdom_of_Hanover|Kingdom_Of_Hanover|  as the eldest son of a  |Protestant|Protestant|  pastor. At the age of 13, he entered the Göttingen Gymnasium, residing at the home of one of the professors. He obtained the leaving certificate  six years later. He had become passionate about the study of  |chemistry|Chemistry| , matriculating at the  |University_of_Göttingen|University_Of_Göttingen|  in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist  |Friedrich_Wöhler|Friedrich_Wöhler| .      In 1842, he became an assistant to  |Robert_Bunsen|Robert_Bunsen|  at the  |Philipps-Universität_Marburg|University_Of_Marburg| . He took his doctoral degree in 1843 at the same university. A new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to  |Lyon_Playfair|Lyon_Playfair,_1St_Baron_Playfair|  at the new Museum of Economic Geology in London and a close friend of  |Edward_Frankland|Edward_Frankland| . From 1847, he was engaged in editing the Handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie  edited by  |Justus_von_Liebig|Justus_Von_Liebig| ,  |Wöhler|Wöhler| , and  |Johann_Christian_Poggendorff|Johann_Christian_Poggendorff| , and he also wrote an important textbook. In 1851, Kolbe succeeded Bunsen as professor of chemistry at Marburg and, in 1865, he was called to the  |Universität_Leipzig|Leipzig_University| . In 1864, he was elected a foreign member of the  |Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences|Royal_Swedish_Academy_Of_Sciences| .      In 1853, he married Charlotte, the daughter of General-Major Wilhelm von Bardeleben. His wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage. They had four children.         As late as the 1840s, and despite  |Friedrich_Wöhlers_synthesis_of_urea|Wöhler_Synthesis|  in 1828, some chemists still believed in the doctrine of  |vitalism|Vitalism| , according to which a special life-force was necessary to create organic compounds. Kolbe promoted the idea that  |organic_compounds|Organic_Compound|  could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this organic context, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes.  He validated his theory by converting  |carbon_disulfide|Carbon_Disulfide|  to  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid|  in several steps . Kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural  |radicals|Radical_Theory| , so contributing to the development of  |structural_theory|Structural_Theory| . A dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary  |alcohols|Alcohol|  was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. Kolbe was the first person to use the word  |synthesis|Chemical_Synthesis|  in its present-day meaning, Kolbe coined the word synthesis during his attempt to transform carbon disulfide into acetic acid. See:  From pp. 145–146:  Im Gegensatz zu den bis jetzt bekannten gepaarten organischen Säuren, welche durch Zersetzung organischer Materien von meist complicierter Zusammensetzung unter Einwirkung kräftiger Agentien und unter Verhältnissen entstanden sind, welche eine mehrfache Auslegung der Zersetzungserscheinungen gestatten, werden diejenigen, welche den Gegenstand der nachstehenden Betrachtungen ausmachen, durch Synthese aus Körpern von möglichst einfacher Zusammensetzung gebildet, so daß sie uns über ihre Constitution kaum im Zweifel lassen, und können deshalb gewissermaßen als Prototypen jener Körperreihe angesehen werden.  and contributed a number of new chemical reactions.     In particular, Kolbe developed procedures for the  |electrolysis|Electrolysis|  of the salts of  |fatty|Fatty_Acid|  and other  |carboxylic_acids|Carboxylic_Acid|     and prepared  |salicylic_acid|Salicylic_Acid| , a building block of  |aspirin|Aspirin|  in a process called  |Kolbe_synthesis|Kolbe_Synthesis|  or  |Kolbe-Schmitt_reaction|Kolbe-Schmitt_Reaction| .   His method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the  |Kolbe_nitrile_synthesis|Kolbe_Nitrile_Synthesis| , and with  |Edward_Frankland|Edward_Frankland|  he found that  |nitriles|Nitrile|  can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids.    In addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work, Kolbe oversaw student research at Leipzig and especially at Marburg; students spending time under his tutelage included  |Peter_Griess|Peter_Griess| ,  |Aleksandr_Mikhailovich_Zaitsev|Aleksandr_Mikhailovich_Zaitsev|  ,  |Theodor_Curtius|Theodor_Curtius|  ,  |Ernst_Otto_Beckmann|Ernst_Otto_Beckmann|  ,  |Carl_Graebe|Carl_Graebe|  ,  |Oscar_Loew|Oscar_Loew| ,  |Constantin_Fahlberg|Constantin_Fahlberg| ,  |Nikolai_Menshutkin|Nikolai_Menshutkin| ,  |Vladimir_Markovnikov|Vladimir_Markovnikov|  ,  |Jacob_Volhard|Jacob_Volhard| ,  |Ludwig_Mond|Ludwig_Mond| ,  |Alexander_Crum_Brown|Alexander_Crum_Brown|  ,  |Maxwell_Simpson|Maxwell_Simpson| , and  |Frederick_Guthrie|Frederick_Guthrie| .        Besides his work for  |periodicals|Periodical|  he wrote numerous books    Kolbe served for more than a decade as what, in modern terms, would be understood the senior editor of the  |Journal_für_Praktische_Chemie|:De:Journal_Für_Praktische_Chemie|  , Kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others, especially after about 1874, that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness. He was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory, and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory.     His rejection of structural chemistry, especially the theories of the structure of benzene by  |August_Kekulé|August_Kekulé| , the theory of the  |asymmetric_carbon_atom|Asymmetric_Carbon_Atom|  by  |J.H._vant_Hoff|Jacobus_Henricus_Van_T_Hoff| , and the reform of chemical nomenclature by  |Adolf_von_Baeyer|Adolf_Von_Baeyer| , was expressed in his vituperative articles in the Journal für Praktische Chemie. Some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists:   ...Baeyer is an excellent experimentor, but he is only an empiricist, lacking sense and capability, and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science...      The violence of his language worked unfairly to limit his posthumous reputation.                      Kurzes Lehrbuch der Chemie . 1.Anorganische Chemie . Vieweg, Braunschweig 2. verb.
