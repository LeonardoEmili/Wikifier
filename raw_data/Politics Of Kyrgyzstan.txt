      The Politics of Kyrgyzstan, officially known as the Kyrgyz Republic takes place in the framework of a  |parliamentary|Parliamentary| |_representative_democratic|Representative_Democracy|  republic, whereby the  |President|President_Of_Kyrgyzstan|  is  |head_of_state|Head_Of_State|  and the  |Prime_Minister_of_Kyrgyzstan|Prime_Minister_Of_Kyrgyzstan|  is  |head_of_government|Head_Of_Government| .  |Executive_power|Executive_Power|  is exercised by the government.  |Legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in both the government and parliament.        In the first years of  |Kyrgyzstans|Kyrgyzstan|  full independence, President  |Askar_Akayev|Askar_Akayev|  appeared wholeheartedly committed to the reform process. However, despite the backing of major Western donors, including the  |International_Monetary_Fund|International_Monetary_Fund|  , Kyrgyzstan had consequential economic difficulties from the outset. These came mainly as a result of the breakup of the  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  trade bloc, which impeded the Republics smooth transfer to a  |free_market|Free_Market|  economy.     In 1993, allegations of corruption against Akayevs closest political associates blossomed into a major scandal. One of those accused of improprieties was Vice President  |Feliks_Kulov|Feliks_Kulov| , who resigned for ethical reasons in December. Following Kulovs resignation, Akayev dismissed the government and called upon the last communist premier,  |Apas_Djumagulov|Apas_Djumagulov| , to form a new one. In January 1994, Akayev initiated a referendum asking for a renewed mandate to complete his term of office. He received 96.2% of the vote.     A new  |Constitution|Constitution_Of_Kyrgyzstan|  was passed by the Parliament in May 1993. In 1994, however, the Parliament failed to produce a  |quorum|Quorum|  for its last scheduled session prior to the expiration of its term . President Akayev was widely accused of having manipulated a boycott by a majority of the parliamentarians. Akayev, in turn, asserted that the communists had caused a political crisis by preventing the legislature from fulfilling its role. Akayev scheduled an October 1994 referendum, overwhelmingly approved by voters, that proposed two amendments to the Constitution, one that would allow the Constitution to be amended by means of a referendum, and the other creating a new bicameral parliament called the  Jogorku Keņesh .     Elections for the two legislative chambers – a 35-seat full-time assembly and a 70-seat part-time assembly – were held in February 1995 after campaigns considered remarkably free and open by most international observers, although the election-day proceedings were marred by widespread irregularities. Independent candidates won most of the seats, suggesting that personalities prevailed over ideologies. The new Parliament convened its initial session in March 1995. One of its first orders of business was the approval of the precise constitutional language on the role of the legislature.     Kyrgyzstans independent political parties competed in the 1996 parliamentary elections. A February 1996 referendum – in violation of the Constitution and the law on referendums – amended the Constitution to give President Akayev more power. It also removed the clause that parliamentarians be directly elected by universal suffrage. Although the changes gave the President the power to dissolve Parliament, it also more clearly defined Parliaments powers. Since that time, Parliament has demonstrated real independence from the executive branch.     An October 1998 referendum approved constitutional changes, including increasing the number of deputies in the upper house, reducing the number of deputies in the lower house, rolling back Parliamentary immunity, reforming land tender rules, and reforming the state budget.     Two rounds of Parliamentary elections were held on 20 February 2000 and 12 March 2000. With the full backing of the United States, the  |Organization_for_Security_and_Co_operation_in_Europe|Organization_For_Security_And_Co_Operation_In_Europe|  reported that the elections failed to comply with commitments to free and fair elections and hence were invalid. Questionable judicial proceedings against opposition candidates and parties limited the choice of candidates available to Kyrgyz voters, while state-controlled media reported favorably on official candidates only and government officials put pressure on independent media outlets that favored the opposition.     In 2002  |Azimbek_Beknazarov|Azimbek_Beknazarov| , a leading opposition figure, was imprisoned by the local authorities, in what many believe to be politically motivated circumstances. This led to protests resulting in clashes with police forces, culminating in the death of five people in  |Jalal_Abad|Jalal_Abad_Kyrgyzstan| .     As May approached the authorities further extended their hold on power, imprisoning the vocal former Presidential ally,  |Feliks_Kulov|Feliks_Kulov| , to ten years for alleged abuses of office . During the same month the entire government resigned, accepting blame for the loss of life during the protests earlier in the year. A new government led by  |Nikolay_Tanayev|Nikolay_Tanayev|  was then formed and has remained ever since.     In November the President faced yet more protests, as the opposition announced it would march on the capital and demand his resignation. The police reacted by arresting large amounts of demonstrators, further adding to international disapproval at the authoritarian nature of Akayevs government.        By June 2003, the lower house of Parliament announced that President Akayev and two other leaders of Kyrgyzstan, from the Soviet era, would be given lifetime immunity from prosecution, raising the prospect of Akayev finally stepping down.     In 2005, following disputed results of the  |2005_parliamentary_elections|Kyrgyz_Parliamentary_Elections_2005| , Kyrgyzstan was thrown into a state of political turmoil, with different parties claiming that they were the legitimate government. On 10 July 2005 interim President and opposition  |Peoples_Movement|Peoples_Movement_Of_Kyrgyzstan|  leader  |Kurmanbek_Bakiyev|Kurmanbek_Bakiyev|  won the  |presidential_election|Kyrgyz_Presidential_Election_2005|  in a  |landslide_victory|Landslide_Victory| . .     In 2006, Bakiyev faced a political crisis as thousands of people demonstrated in a series of protests in  |Bishkek|Bishkek| . They accused him of reneging on promised constitutional reforms limiting presidential power and giving more authority to the parliament and cabinet. They also accused him of failing to eradicate corruption, crime, and poverty.  Bakiyev in turn accused the opposition of plotting a coup against him. Several parliamentarians had been killed during the political unrest.       |Presidential_elections|Kyrgyzstani_Presidential_Election_2009| , originally expected in 2010, were rescheduled for 23 July 2009.  President Bakiyev was widely expected to retain his mandate, while the opposition  |United_Peoples_Movement|United_Peoples_Movement|  announced on 20 April 2009 that it would field a single candidate –  |Social_Democratic_Party|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Kyrgyzstan|  leader  |Almaz_Atambayev|Almaz_Atambayev| . Bruce Pannier , RFE/RL, 20 April 2009. The election turnout was reported at 79.3%.  As of 00:45 local time in Kyrgyzstan on 25 July 2009 , Bakiyev had won the election with 83.8% of the vote.      In assessing the election, the OSCE stated that Bakiyev had gained an unfair advantage and that media bias did not allow voters to make an informed choice. Additionally, they found that the election was marred by many problems and irregularities , citing  |ballot_stuffing|Ballot_Stuffing|  and problems with the counting of votes. , OSCE press release On polling day Atambayev withdrew his candidacy claiming widespread fraud, stating due to massive, unprecedented violations, we consider these elections illegitimate and a new election should be held. ,  |BBC_News|Bbc_News|  Independent candidate Jenishbek Nazaraliev also withdrew on election day. .  |RT|Rt| . 23 July 2009. An opposition rally of 1,000 people in Balykchy on election day was broken up by riot police.     The arrest of an opposition figure on 6 April 2010 in the town of Talas led opposition supporters to protest.  The protestors took control of a governmental building, demanding a new government. Riot police were sent from Bishkek, and managed to temporarily regain control of the building. Later the same day several more opposition figures were arrested, while the government claimed to have regained control of the situation. The following day, however, hundreds of opposition supporters gathered in Bishkek and marched on the government headquarters. Security personnel attempted to disperse the protestors with the use of stun grenades and live rounds, at the cost of dozens of lives. The protests continued, however, resulting in the flight of President Bakiyev to his southern stronghold of  |Jalalabad|Jalalabad| , and the freeing later the same day of the arrested opposition figures. A new government was formed under opposition leader  |Roza_Otunbayeva|Roza_Otunbayeva| , while Bakiyev remained for several days in southern Kyrgyzstan, before fleeing to  |Belarus|Belarus| , where he was given asylum by  |President_Lukashenko|Alexander_Lukashenko| . The new interim government held consultations on a new constitution, intended to increase the powers of the parliament and reduce those of the president. A referendum was held on the resulting document on 27 June 2010, and was approved by over 90% of voters, with a turnout of 72%.  Elections were subsequently held on 10 October 2010. These elections resulted in five parties reaching the 5% threshold necessary to enter parliament.         |President|President_Of_Kyrgyzstan| |_Sooronbay_Jeenbekov|Sooronbay_Jeenbekov| |_Social_Democratic_Party|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Kyrgyzstan| |_Prime_Minister|Prime_Minister_Of_Kyrgyzstan| |_Muhammetkaliy_Abulgaziyev|Muhammetkaliy_Abulgaziyev| |_Independent|Independent| |_rgyzst|Rgyzst| |_rgyz_Republ|Rgyz_Republ| |_rgyz_Republ|Rgyz_Republ| |rgyzst|Rgyzst| |_rgyzst|Rgyzst|  Joghorku Keneš45 seats; members were elected by popular vote from single member  |constituencies|Constituency| 60 seats; 45 members of which were elected by popular vote from single member constituencies, and 15 of which were from national party lists on a proportional basis with a 5% threshold20025th ed.Myizam Chygaruu Jyiyny28 February 200515 November 200725 December 2007       January 2007oblastlar, singular – oblastyshaar Batken Bishkek Karakol Jalal-Abad Naryn Osh Talas         signatory          |ganizati|Ganizati|    correspondent observer       UNECE            .
