        Jean Maurice Eugène Clément Cocteau  was a French poet, playwright, novelist, designer, filmmaker, visual artist and critic. Cocteau is best known for his novels Le Grand Écart , Le Livre Blanc , and  Les Enfants Terribles  ; the stage plays  La Voix Humaine  ,  La Machine Infernale  ,  Les Parents terribles  ,  La Machine à écrire  , and  LAigle à deux têtes  ; and the films  The Blood of a Poet  ,  Les Parents Terribles  , from his own eponymous piéce,  Beauty and the Beast  ,  Orpheus  , and  Testament of Orpheus  , which alongside Blood of a Poet and Orpheus constitute the so-called  |Orphic_Trilogy|Orphic_Trilogy| . He was described as one of  |avant-gardes|Avant-Garde|  most successful and influential filmmakers by  |AllMovie|Allmovie| .        Cocteau was born in  |Maisons-Laffitte|Maisons-Laffitte| ,  |Yvelines|Yvelines| , a town near  |Paris|Paris| , to Georges Cocteau and his wife, Eugénie Lecomte; a socially prominent Parisian family. His father was a lawyer and amateur painter who committed suicide when Cocteau was nine. From 1900–1904, Cocteau attended the  |Lycée_Condorcet|Lycée_Condorcet|  where he met and began a physical relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos who would later reappear throughout Cocteaus oeuvre.  He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, Aladdins Lamp, at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in  |Bohemian|Bohemianism|  artistic circles as The Frivolous Prince, the title of a volume he published at twenty-two.  |Edith_Wharton|Edith_Wharton|  described him as a man to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...                  In his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers  |Marcel_Proust|Marcel_Proust| ,  |André_Gide|André_Gide| , and  |Maurice_Barrès|Maurice_Barrès| . In 1912, he collaborated with  |Léon_Bakst|Léon_Bakst|  on  Le Dieu bleu  for the  |Ballets_Russes|Ballets_Russes| ; the principal dancers being  |Tamara_Karsavina|Tamara_Karsavina|  and  |Vaslav_Nijinsky|Vaslav_Nijinsky| . During  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  Cocteau served in the  |Red_Cross|Red_Cross|  as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet  |Guillaume_Apollinaire|Guillaume_Apollinaire| , artists  |Pablo_Picasso|Pablo_Picasso|  and  |Amedeo_Modigliani|Amedeo_Modigliani| , and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian impresario  |Sergei_Diaghilev|Sergei_Diaghilev|  persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in  Parade  in 1917. It was produced by  |Diaghilev|Diaghilev| , with sets by Picasso, the  |libretto|Libretto|  by Apollinaire and the music by  |Erik_Satie|Erik_Satie| . The piece was later expanded into a full opera, with music by Satie,  |Francis_Poulenc|Francis_Poulenc|  and  |Maurice_Ravel|Maurice_Ravel| . If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform, wrote Cocteau, with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.  He denied being a Surrealist or being in any way attached to the movement. Cocteau wrote the libretto for  |Igor_Stravinskys|Igor_Stravinsky|  opera-oratorio  Oedipus rex , which had its original performance in the  |Théâtre_Sarah_Bernhardt|Théâtre_Sarah_Bernhardt|  in Paris on 30 May 1927.     An important exponent of  |avant-garde_art|Avant-Garde_Art| , Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as  |Les_six|Les_Six| . In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named  |Le_Boeuf_sur_le_Toit|Le_Boeuf_Sur_Le_Toit| , a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.           In 1918 he met the French poet  |Raymond_Radiguet|Raymond_Radiguet| . They collaborated extensively, socialized, and undertook many journeys and vacations together. Cocteau also got Radiguet exempted from military service. Admiring of Radiguets great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friends works in his artistic circle and arranged for the publication by Grasset of  Le Diable au corps  , exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the  |Nouveau_Monde|Nouveau_Monde|  literary prize. Some contemporaries and later commentators thought there might have been a romantic component to their friendship. Cocteau himself was aware of this perception, and worked earnestly to dispel the notion that their relationship was sexual in nature.      There is disagreement over Cocteaus reaction to Radiguets sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to  |opium|Opium|  addiction. Opponents of that interpretation point out that he did not attend the funeral and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of  Les noces   by the  |Ballets_Russes|Ballets_Russes|  at  |Monte_Carlo|Monte_Carlo| . Cocteau himself much later characterised his reaction as one of stupor and disgust.  His opium addiction at the time,  Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the  |Monte_Carlo_Opera|Monte_Carlo_Opera| . Cocteaus opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style. His most notable book,  Les Enfants Terribles , was written in a week during a strenuous  |opium|Opium|  weaning. In , he recounts the experience of his recovery from opium addiction in 1929. His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world. Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent, Catholic philosopher  |Jacques_Maritain|Jacques_Maritain| . Under Maritains influence Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church. He again returned to the Church later in life and undertook a number of religious art projects.     The Human Voice La Voix humaine . The story involves one woman on stage speaking on the telephone with her departing lover, who is leaving her to marry another woman. The telephone proved to be the perfect prop for Cocteau to explore his ideas, feelings, and algebra concerning human needs and realities in communication.     Cocteau acknowledged in the introduction to the script that the play was motivated, in part, by complaints from his actresses that his works were too writer/director-dominated and gave the players little opportunity to show off their full range of talents. La Voix humaine was written, in effect, as an extravagant aria for Madame  |Berthe_Bovy|Berthe_Bovy| . Before came  Orphée , later turned into one of his more successful films; after came  La Machine infernale , arguably his most fully realized work of art. La Voix humaine is deceptively simple — a woman alone on stage for almost one hour of non-stop theatre speaking on the telephone with her departing lover. It is full of theatrical codes harking back to the Dadaists Vox Humana experiments after  |World_War_One|World_War_One| , Alphonse de Lamartines La Voix humaine , part of his larger work Harmonies poétiques et religieuses and the effect of the creation of the Vox Humana , an  |organ_stop|Organ_Stop|  of the Regal Class by Church organ masters that attempted to imitate the human voice but never succeeded in doing better than the sound of a male chorus at a distance.     Reviews varied at the time and since but whatever the critique, the play represents Cocteaus state of mind and feelings towards his actors at the time: on the one hand, he wanted to spoil and please them; on the other, he was fed up with their diva antics and was ready for revenge. It is also true that none of Cocteaus works has inspired as much imitation:  |Francis_Poulencs|Francis_Poulenc|  opera  La voix humaine ,  |Gian_Carlo_Menottis|Gian_Carlo_Menotti|  opera buffa  The Telephone  and  |Roberto_Rossellinis|Roberto_Rossellini|  film version in Italian with  |Anna_Magnani|Anna_Magnani|   LAmore  . There has also been a long line of interpreters including  |Simone_Signoret|Simone_Signoret| ,  |Ingrid_Bergman|Ingrid_Bergman|  and  |Liv_Ullmann|Liv_Ullmann|  and  |Julia_Migenes|Julia_Migenes| ,  |Denise_Duval|Denise_Duval| ,  |Renata_Scotto|Renata_Scotto| ,  |Anja_Silja|Anja_Silja|  and  |Felicity_Lott|Felicity_Lott|  .     According to one theory about how Cocteau was inspired to write La Voix humaine, he was experimenting with an idea by fellow French playwright  |Henri_Bernstein|Henri_Bernstein| .             Biographer  |James_S._Williams|James_S._Williams|  describes Cocteaus politics as naturally Right-leaning.  During the  |Nazi_occupation_of_France|Nazi_Occupation_Of_France| , Cocteaus friend  |Arno_Breker|Arno_Breker|  convinced him that  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  was a pacifist and patron of the arts with Frances best interests in mind. In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the Führers sexuality. Cocteau effusively praised Brekers sculptures in an article entitled Salut à Breker published in 1942. This piece caused him to be arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war, though he was cleared of any wrongdoing and had used his contacts to his failed attempt to save friends such as  |Max_Jacob|Max_Jacob| .        In 1940, Le Bel Indifférent, Cocteaus play written for and starring  |Édith_Piaf|Édith_Piaf| , was enormously successful. He also worked with  |Pablo_Picasso|Pablo_Picasso|  on several projects and was a friend of most of the European art community. Cocteaus films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into  |French_cinema|Cinema_Of_France|  and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming  |French_New_Wave|French_New_Wave|  genre.     Cocteau is best known for his novel  Les Enfants Terribles  , and the films  The Blood of a Poet  ,  Beauty and the Beast  ,  Les Parents terribles  , and  Orpheus  . His final film,  Le Testament dOrphée   , featured appearances by Picasso and matador  |Luis_Miguel_Dominguín|Luis_Miguel_Dominguín| , along with  |Yul_Brynner|Yul_Brynner| , who also helped finance the film.     In 1945 Cocteau was one of several designers who created sets for the  |Théâtre_de_la_Mode|Théâtre_De_La_Mode| . He drew inspiration from filmmaker  |René_Clair|René_Clair|  while making Tribute to René Clair: I Married a Witch. The  |maquette|Maquette|  is described in his Journal 1942–1945, in his entry for 12 February 1945:        Jean Cocteau never hid his  |homosexuality|Homosexuality| . He was the author of the mildly homoerotic and semi-autobiographical Le livre blanc ,  published anonymously in 1928. He never repudiated its authorship and a later edition of the novel features his foreword and drawings. The novel begins:          Frequently his work, either literary , graphic or cinematographic , is pervaded with homosexual undertones, homoerotic imagery/symbolism or outright  |camp|Camp| . In 1947  |Paul_Morihien|W:Fr:Paul_Morihien|  published a clandestine edition of  Querelle de Brest  by  |Jean_Genet|Jean_Genet| , featuring 29 very explicit erotic drawings by Cocteau. In recent years several albums of Cocteaus  |homoerotica|Homoerotica|  have been available to the general public.     Cocteau had affairs with Jean Le Roy,  |Raymond_Radiguet|Raymond_Radiguet| ,  |Jean_Desbordes|W:Fr:Jean_Desbordes| ,  |Marcel_Khill|W:Fr:Marcel_Khill| , and  |Panama_Al_Brown|Panama_Al_Brown| .     In the 1930s, Cocteau is rumoured to have had a very brief affair with Princess  |Natalie_Paley|Natalie_Paley| , the daughter of a  |Romanov|Romanov| |Grand_Duke|Grand_Duke|  and herself a sometime actress, model, and former wife of couturier  |Lucien_Lelong|Lucien_Lelong| .      Cocteaus longest-lasting relationships were with French actors  |Jean_Marais|Jean_Marais|   and  |Édouard_Dermit|W:Fr:Édouard_Dermit| , whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in  The Eternal Return  ,  Beauty and the Beast  ,  Ruy Blas  , and  Orpheus  .       Cocteau died of a heart attack at his  |château|Château|  in  |Milly-la-Forêt|Milly_La_Foret| , Essonne, France, on 11 October 1963 at the age of 74. His friend, French singer  |Édith_Piaf|Édith_Piaf| , died the day before but that was announced on the morning of Cocteaus day of death; it has been said that his heart failed upon hearing of Piafs death. Actually, according to author  |Roger_Peyrefitte|Roger_Peyrefitte| , Propos secrets, Paris: Albin Michel, 1977 since early that year Cocteau had been devastated after a breach with his longtime friend and extremely wealthy and generous patroness  |Francine_Weisweiller|Francine_Weisweiller|  He had a very severe heart attack on April 22.     According to his wishes Cocteau is buried beneath the floor of the Chapelle Saint-Blaise des Simples in Milly-la-Forêt. Wilson, Scott.

The epitaph on his gravestone set in the floor of the chapel reads: I stay with you .       In 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the  |Académie_française|Académie_Française|  and  |The_Royal_Academy_of_Belgium|The_Royal_Academies_For_Science_And_The_Arts_Of_Belgium| .
