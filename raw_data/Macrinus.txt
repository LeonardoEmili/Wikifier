               Macrinus  was  |Roman_Emperor|Roman_Emperor|  from April 217 to 8 June 218. He reigned jointly with his young son  |Diadumenian|Diadumenian| us. Macrinus was by origin a  |Berber|Berbers|  from  |Mauretania_Caesariensis|Mauretania_Caesariensis| . A member of the  |equestrian|Equites|  class, he became the first emperor who did not hail from the  |senatorial_class|Roman_Senate|  and was the first emperor from  |Mauretania|Mauretania| . Before becoming emperor, Macrinus served under Emperor  |Caracalla|Caracalla|  as a  |praetorian_prefect|Praetorian_Prefect|  and dealt with Romes civil affairs. He later conspired against Caracalla and had him murdered in a bid to protect his own life, succeeding him as emperor.     Macrinus was proclaimed emperor of Rome by 11 April 217 while in the eastern provinces of the empire and was subsequently confirmed as such by the Senate; however, for the duration of his reign, he never had the opportunity to return to Rome. His predecessors policies had left Romes coffers empty and the empire at war with several kingdoms, including  |Parthia|Parthian_Empire| ,  |Armenia|Kingdom_Of_Armenia|  and  |Dacia|Dacia| . As emperor, Macrinus first attempted to enact reform to bring economic and diplomatic stability to Rome. While Macrinus diplomatic actions brought about peace with each of the individual kingdoms, the additional monetary costs and subsequent fiscal reforms generated unrest in the Roman military.     Caracallas aunt  |Julia_Maesa|Julia_Maesa|  took advantage of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson,  |Elagabalus|Elagabalus| , recognized as emperor. Macrinus was overthrown at the  |Battle_of_Antioch|Battle_Of_Antioch|  on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions. Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome but was captured in  |Chalcedon|Chalcedon|  and later executed in  |Cappadocia|Cappadocia| . He sent his son to the care of  |Artabanus_V_of_Parthia|Artabanus_V_Of_Parthia| , but Diadumenianus was also captured before he could reach his destination and executed. After Macrinus death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed.       Macrinus was born in  |Caesarea_Mauretaniae|Caesarea_Mauretaniae|   in the  |Roman_province|Roman_Province|  of  |Mauretania|Mauretania|  to an  |equestrian|Equites|  family of Phoenician or Berber origins.  According to D.S. Potter, his pierced ear was an indication of his Berber origins Potter 2004, p. 146. . He received an education which allowed him to ascend to the Roman political class.  Over the years, he earned a reputation as a skilled lawyer; and, under Emperor  |Septimius_Severus|Septimius_Severus| , he became an important bureaucrat. Severus successor Caracalla later appointed him a  |prefect|Praetorian_Prefect|  of the  |Praetorian_Guard|Praetorian_Guard| .      While Macrinus probably enjoyed the trust of Emperor  |Caracalla|Caracalla| , this may have changed when, according to tradition, it was prophesied that he would depose and succeed the emperor. Macrinus, fearing for his safety, resolved to have Caracalla murdered before he was condemned.      In the spring of 217, Caracalla was in the eastern provinces preparing a campaign against the  |Parthian_Empire|Parthian_Empire| .   Macrinus was among his staff, as were other members of the Praetorian Guard. In April, Caracalla went to visit a temple of  |Luna|Selene|  near the site of the  |battle_of_Carrhae|Battle_Of_Carrhae|  and was accompanied only by his personal guard, which included Macrinus. On April 8, while traveling to the temple, Caracalla was stabbed to death by Justin Martialis, a soldier whom Macrinus had recruited to commit the murder.  In the aftermath, Martialis was killed by one of Caracallas men.     For two or three days, Rome remained without an emperor.  By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor and assumed all of the imperial titles and powers, without waiting for the Senate. The army backed his claim as emperor and the Senate, so far away, was powerless to intervene.  Macrinus never returned to Rome as emperor and remained based in Antioch for the duration of his reign.  Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title of Augusta to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the  |Antonine_dynasty|Five_Good_Emperors| , thus making him second in command.     At the time of Diadumenians accession he was eight years old.        Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was accepted by the Senate for two reasons: for the removal of Caracalla, and for having received the loyalty of the army. The senators were less concerned by Macrinus Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian social background and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion of him was reduced by his decisions to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only the Senate had the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked down upon.     Macrinus had several issues that he needed to deal with at the time of his accession, which had been left behind by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a tendency towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve.  Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Romes income.  Most of the money was spent on the army; he had greatly increased their pay from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year.   The increased expenditures forced Caracalla to strip bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference. This shortfall left Rome in a dire fiscal situation that Macrinus needed to address.     Macrinus was at first occupied by the threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome had been at war since the reign of Caracalla. Macrinus settled a peace deal with the Parthians, after fighting an indecisive battle at  |Nisibis|Nusaybin|  in 217.  In return for peace, Macrinus was forced to pay a large indemnity to the Parthian ruler  |Artabanus_V|Artabanus_V_Of_Parthia| .   Rome was at the time also under threat from Dacia and Armenia, so any deal with Parthia would likely have been beneficial to Rome.  Next, Macrinus turned his attention to Armenia.  In 216, Caracalla had imprisoned  |Khosrov_I_of_Armenia|Khosrov_I_Of_Armenia|  and his family after Khosrov had agreed to meet with Caracalla at a conference to discuss some issue between himself and his sons. Caracalla instead installed a new Roman governor to rule over Armenia. These actions angered the Armenian people and they soon rebelled against Rome.   Macrinus settled a peace treaty with them by returning the crown and loot to Khosrovs son and successor  |Tiridates_II|Tiridates_Ii_Of_Armenia|  and releasing his mother from prison, and by restoring Armenia to its status as a client kingdom of Rome.  Macrinus made peace with the Dacians by releasing hostages, though this was likely not handled by himself but by  |Marcius_Agrippa|Marcius_Agrippa| .  In matters of foreign policy, Macrinus showed a tendency towards settling disputes through diplomacy and a reluctance to engage in military conflict, though this may have been due more to the lack of resources and manpower than to his own personal preference.     Macrinus began to overturn Caracallas fiscal policies and moved closer towards those that had been set forth by  |Septimius_Severus|Septimius_Severus| .  One such policy change involved the pay of Roman legionaries. The soldiers that were already enlisted during Caracallas reign enjoyed exorbitant payments which were impossible for Macrinus to reduce without risking a potential rebellion. Instead, Macrinus allowed the enlisted soldiers to retain their higher payments, but he reduced the pay of new recruits to the level which had been set by Severus.   Macrinus revalued the  |Roman_currency|Roman_Currency| , increasing the silver purity and weight of the  |denarius|Denarius|  from 50.78 percent and 1.66 grams at the end of Caracallas reign to 57.85 percent and 1.82 grams from Fall 217 to the end of his reign, so that it mirrored Severus fiscal policy for the period 197â€“209 A.D.   Macrinus goal with these policies might have been to return Rome to the relative economic stability that had been enjoyed under Severus reign, though it came with a cost.  The fiscal changes that Macrinus enacted might have been tenable had it not been for the military. By this time, the strength of the military was too great and by enacting his reforms he angered the veteran soldiers, who viewed his actions in reducing the pay of new recruits as a foreshadowing of eventual reductions in their own privileges and pay. This significantly reduced Macrinus popularity with the legions that had declared him emperor.      Caracallas mother  |Julia_Domna|Julia_Domna|  was initially left in peace when Macrinus became emperor. This changed when Macrinus discovered that she was conspiring against him and had her placed under house arrest in Antioch.  By this time Julia Domna was suffering from an advanced stage of breast cancer and soon died in Antioch, possibly by starving herself. Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domnas sister  |Julia_Maesa|Julia_Maesa|  and her children back to  |Emesa|Homs|  in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown.  Macrinus remained in Antioch instead of going to Rome upon being declared emperor, a step which furthered his unpopularity in Rome and contributed to his eventual downfall.           Julia Maesa had retired to her home town of Emesa with an immense fortune, which she had accrued over the course of twenty years. She took her children,  |Julia_Soaemias|Julia_Soaemias|  and  |Julia_Mamaea|Julia_Mamaea| , and grandchildren, including Elagabalus, with her to Emesa.  Elagabalus, aged 14, was the chief priest of the  |Phoenicia|Phoenicia|  n  |sun-deity|Solar_Deity| |Elagabalus|Elagabalus|  in Emesa.  Soldiers from  |Legio_III_Gallica|Legio_Iii_Gallica|  , that had been stationed at the nearby camp of Raphanea, often visited Emesa and went to see Elagabalus perform his priestly rituals and duties while there.  Julia Maesa took advantage of this, to suggest to the soldiers that Elagabalus was indeed the illegitimate son of Caracalla. On May 16, Elagabalus was proclaimed emperor by the Legio III Gallica at its camp at Raphanea.  Upon Elagabalus revolt, Macrinus travelled to Apamea and conferred the title of Augustus onto his son, Diadumenianus, and made him co-emperor.       Macrinus realised that his life was in danger but struggled to decide upon a course of action and remained at Antioch.  He sent a force of cavalry commanded by Ulpinus Julianus to regain control of the rebels, but they failed and Ulpinus died in the attempt. This failure further strengthened Elagabalus army.  Soon after, a force under Elagabalus tutor Gannys marched on  |Antioch|Antioch|  and engaged Macrinus army on 8 June 218 near the village of Immae, located approximately 24 miles from Antioch. At some point during the ensuing  |Battle_of_Antioch|Battle_Of_Antioch| , Macrinus deserted the field and returned to Antioch. Macrinus was then forced to flee from Antioch as fighting erupted in the city as well. Elagabalus himself subsequently entered Antioch as the new ruler of the Roman Empire.  Macrinus fled for Rome; he traveled as far as  |Chalcedon|Chalcedon|  before being recognized and captured.  His son and co-emperor Diadumenianus, sent to the care of Artabanus V of Parthia, was himself captured in transit at Zeugma and killed in June of 218. Diadumenianus reign lasted a total of 14 months, and he was about 10 years old when he died. Macrinus, upon learning of his sons death, tried to escape captivity, but he injured himself in the unsuccessful attempt and was afterward executed in Cappadocia; his head was sent to Elagabalus. Much like Macrinus, Diadumenianus head was also cut off and sent to Elagabalus as a trophy.       Macrinus and his son Diadumenianus were declared hostes, enemies of the state, by the Senate immediately after news had arrived of their deaths and as part of an official declaration of support for the usurper Elagabalus, who was recognized in the Senate as the new Emperor. The declaration of hostes led to two actions being taken against the images of the former Emperors. First, their portraits were destroyed and their names were stricken from inscriptions and papyri. The second action, taken by the Roman soldiers who had rebelled against Macrinus in favour of Elagabalus, was to destroy all of the works and possessions of Macrinus. The damnatio memoriae against Macrinus is among the earliest of such sanctions enacted by the Senate. Many of the marble busts of Macrinus that exist were defaced and mutilated as a response to the damnatio memoriae and many of the coins depicting Macrinus and Diadumenianus were also destroyed. These actions against Macrinus are evidence of his unpopularity in Rome.
