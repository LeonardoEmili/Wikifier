|Jamaica|Jamaica|  lies  south of  |Cuba|Cuba|  and  west of  |Haiti|Haiti| . At its greatest extent, Jamaica is  long, and its width varies between . Jamaica has a small area of . However, Jamaica is the largest island of the  |Commonwealth_Caribbean|Commonwealth_Caribbean|  and the third largest of the  |Greater_Antilles|Greater_Antilles| , after  |Cuba|Geography_Of_Cuba|  and  |Hispaniola|Hispaniola| . Many small islands are located along the south coast of Jamaica, such as the  |Port_Royal_Cays|Port_Royal_Cays| . Southwest of mainland Jamaica lies  |Pedro_Bank|Pedro_Bank| , an area of shallow seas, with a number of  |cays|Cay|  , extending generally east to west for over . To the southeast lies Morant Bank, with the  |Morant_Cays|Morant_Cays| ,  from  |Morant_Point|Morant_Point| , the easternmost point of mainland Jamaica.  |Alice_Shoal|Alice_Shoal| ,  southwest of the main island of Jamaica, falls within the Jamaicaâ€“Colombia Joint Regime. It has an  |Exclusive_Economic_Zone|Exclusive_Economic_Zone|  of .          Jamaica and the other islands of the Antilles evolved from an arc of ancient volcanoes that rose from the sea millions of years ago. During periods of submersion, thick layers of limestone were laid down over the old igneous and metamorphic rock. In many places, the limestone is thousands of feet thick. The country can be divided into three landform regions: the central mountain chain formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks; the karst limestone hills in the Cockpit area; the low-lying coastal plains and interior valleys.      The highest area is the  |Blue_Mountains|Blue_Mountains|  range. These eastern mountains are formed by a central ridge of metamorphic rock running northwest to southeast from which many long spurs jut to the north and south. For a distance of over , the crest of the ridge exceeds . The highest point is  |Blue_Mountain_Peak|Blue_Mountain_Peak|  at . The Blue Mountains rise to these elevations from the coastal plain in the space of about , thus producing one of the steepest general gradients in the world. In this part of the country, the old metamorphic rock reveals itself through the surrounding limestone. To the north of the Blue Mountains lies the strongly tilted  |limestone|Limestone|  plateau forming the  |John_Crow_Mountains|John_Crow_Mountains| . This range rises to elevations of over . To the west, in the central part of the country, are two high rolling plateaus: the  |Dry_Harbour_Mountains|Dry_Harbour_Mountains|  to the north and the Manchester Plateau to the south. Between the two, the land is rugged and here, also, the limestone layers are broken by the older rocks. Streams that rise in the region flow outward and sink soon after reaching the limestone layers.     The limestone plateau covers two-thirds of the country, so that  |karst|Karst|  formations dominate the island. Karst is formed by the erosion of the limestone in solution. Sinkholes, caves and caverns, disappearing streams, hummocky hills, and terra rosa soils in the valleys are distinguishing features of a karst landscape; all these are present in Jamaica. To the west of the mountains is the rugged terrain of the  |Cockpit_Country|Cockpit_Country| , one of the worlds most dramatic examples of karst topography.     The Cockpit Country is pockmarked with steep-sided hollows, as much as  deep in places, which are separated by conical hills and ridges. On the north, the main defining feature is the fault-based Escarpment , a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west, through Windsor in the centre, to Campbells and the start of the Barbecue Bottom Road . The Barbecue Bottom Road, which runs north-south, high along the side of a deep, fault-based valley in the east, is the only drivable route across the Cockpit Country. However, there are two old, historical trails that cross further west, the Troy Trail, and the Quick Step Trail, both of which are seldom used  and difficult to find. In the southwest, near Quick Step, is the district known as the Land of Look Behind, so named because Spanish horsemen venturing into this region of hostile runaway slaves were said to have ridden two to a mount, one rider facing to the rear to keep a precautionary watch. Where the ridges between sinkholes in the plateau area have dissolved, flat-bottomed basins or valleys have been formed that are filled with terra rosa soils, some of the most productive on the island. The largest basin is the Vale of Clarendon,  long and  wide. Queen of Spains Valley,  |Nassau_Valley|Nassau_Valley| , and Cave Valley were formed by the same process.       The coastline of Jamaica is one of many contrasts. The northeast shore is severely eroded by the ocean. There are many small inlets in the rugged coastline, but no coastal plain of any extent. A narrow strip of plains along the northern coast offers calm seas and white sand beaches. Behind the beaches is a flat raised plain of uplifted coral reef.     The southern coast has small stretches of plains lined by black sand beaches. These are backed by cliffs of limestone where the plateaus end. In many stretches with no coastal plain, the cliffs drop  straight to the sea. In the southwest, broad plains stretch inland for a number of kilometres. The  |Black_River|Black_River|  courses  through the largest of these plains. The swamplands of the Great Morass and the Upper Morass fill much of the plains. The western coastline contains the islands finest beaches.                 Two types of climate are found in Jamaica. An upland tropical climate prevails on the windward side of the mountains, whereas a semiarid climate predominates on the leeward side. Warm trade winds from the east and northeast bring rainfall throughout the year. The rainfall is heaviest from May to October, with peaks in those two months. The average rainfall is  per year. Rainfall is much greater in the mountain areas facing the north and east, however. Where the higher elevations of the John Crow Mountains and the Blue Mountains catch the rain from the moisture-laden winds, rainfall exceeds  per year. Since the southwestern half of the island lies in the rain shadow of the mountains, it has a semiarid climate and receives fewer than  of rainfall annually.     Temperatures in Jamaica are fairly constant throughout the year, averaging  in the lowlands and  at higher elevations. Temperatures may dip to below  at the peaks of the Blue Mountains. The island receives, in addition to the northeast trade winds, refreshing onshore breezes during the day and cooling offshore breezes at night. These are known on Jamaica as the Doctor Breeze and the Undertakers Breeze, respectively.     Jamaica lies in the Atlantic  |hurricane_belt|Hurricane_Belt| ; as a result, the island sometimes experiences significant storm damage. Powerful hurricanes which have hit the island directly causing death and destruction include  |Hurricane_Charlie|Hurricane_Charlie|  in 1951 and  |Hurricane_Gilbert|Hurricane_Gilbert|  in 1988. Several other powerful hurricanes have passed near to the island with damaging effects. In 1980, for example,  |Hurricane_Allen|Hurricane_Allen|  destroyed nearly all Jamaicas banana crop.  |Hurricane_Ivan|Hurricane_Ivan|  swept past the island causing heavy damage and a number of deaths; in 2005, Hurricanes  |Dennis|Hurricane_Dennis|  and  |Emily|Hurricane_Emily|  brought heavy rains to the island. A Category 4 hurricane,  |Hurricane_Dean|Hurricane_Dean| , caused some deaths and heavy damage to Jamaica in August 2007.     The  |first_recorded|Pre-1600_Atlantic_Hurricane_Seasons|  hurricane to hit Jamaica was in 1519. The island has been struck by tropical cyclones regularly. During two of the coldest periods in the last 250 years , the frequency of hurricanes in the Jamaica region was unusually high. Another peak of activity occurred in the 1910s, the coldest decade of the 20th century. On the other hand, hurricane formation was greatly diminished from 1968 to 1994, which for some reason coincides with the great  |Sahel_drought|Sahel_Drought| .           Although most of Jamaicas native vegetation has been stripped in order to make room for cultivation, some areas have been left virtually undisturbed since the time of  |Columbus|Christopher_Columbus| . Indigenous vegetation can be found along the northern coast from Rio Bueno to  |Discovery_Bay|Discovery_Bay,_Jamaica| , in the highest parts of the Blue Mountains, and in the heart of the Cockpit Country.     As in the case of vegetation, considerable loss of wildlife has occurred beginning with the settlement of native peoples in the region millennia ago. For example, the only  |pinniped|Pinniped|  ever known to the Caribbean, the  |Caribbean_monk_seal|Caribbean_Monk_Seal|  once occurred in Jamaican waters and has now been driven to  |extinction|Extinction| .

National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC Mongoose , introduced to Jamaica in 1872 to reduce rat populations that damaged commercial sugarcane  crops,  prey on several Jamaican species, including the critically endangered, Jamaican iguana , and have been implicated in the historical population declines and extinctions of many others.  Other wildlife species inhabiting the island include, the West Indian Manatee , American crocodile , and the endemic Homerus Swallowtail ,which is the largest butterfly species in the Western Hemisphere.
