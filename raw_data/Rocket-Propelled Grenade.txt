              A rocket-propelled grenade  is a  |shoulder-fired|Shoulder-Fired_Missile| |anti-tank_weapon|Anti-Tank_Weapon|  system that fires rockets equipped with an  |explosive|Explosive| |warhead|Warhead| . Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier. These warheads are affixed to a  |rocket_motor|Rocket_Motor|  which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades, while others are single-use. RPGs, with some exceptions, are generally  |loaded_from_the_muzzle|Muzzleloader| .     RPGs with  |high_explosive_anti-tank_warheads|High_Explosive_Anti-Tank_Warhead|  are very effective against armored vehicles such as  |armored_personnel_carriers|Armored_Personnel_Carrier|  . However, heavily armored vehicles from the 2010s, such as  |main_battle_tanks|Main_Battle_Tank| , are generally too well armored  to be penetrated by an RPG, unless less armored sections of vehicle are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems and other unarmored targets.     The term rocket-propelled grenade is, strictly speaking, a  |backronym|Backronym| ; it stems from the  |Russian_language|Russian_Language|  РПГ or ручной противотанковый гранатомёт , meaning hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher , the name given to early Russian designs.            The static nature of  |trench_warfare|Trench_Warfare|  in  |World_War_I|World_War_I|  encouraged the use of shielded defenses, even including personal armor, that were impenetrable by standard rifle ammunition. This led to some isolated experiments with higher caliber rifles, similar to  |elephant_guns|Elephant_Gun| , using  |armor-piercing_ammunition|Armor-Piercing_Ammunition| . The very first  |tanks|Tank| , the British  |Mark_I|Mark_I_Tank| , could be penetrated by these weapons under the right conditions.  |Mark_IV_tanks|Mark_Iv_Tank| , however, had slightly thicker armor. In response, the German rushed to create an upgraded version of these early anti-armor rifles, the  |Tankgewehr_M1918|Tankgewehr_M1918| , the first  |anti-tank_rifle|Anti-Tank_Rifle| . In the  |inter-war_years|Inter-War_Years| , tank armor continued to increase overall, to the point that anti-tank rifles could no longer be effective against anything but  |light_tanks|Light_Tank| ; any rifle made powerful enough for heavier tanks would exceed the ability of a soldier to carry and fire the weapon.     Even with the first tanks, artillery officers often used  |field_guns|Field_Gun|  depressed to fire directly at armored targets. However, this practice expended much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker. This led to the concept of  |anti-tank_guns|Anti-Tank_Guns| , a form of  |artillery|Artillery|  specifically designed to destroy  |armored_fighting_vehicles|Armored_Fighting_Vehicles| , normally from static defensive positions . Oxford Advanced Lerners Dictionary of Current English, New Edition, Cornelsen & Oxford, A S Hornby, 5th edition, p. 42.      The first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s, and by  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  was a common appearance in most armies.  In order to penetrate armor they fired specialized ammunition from proportionally longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns. Militärisches Studienglosar Englisch Teil II/ Teil III, Deutsch – Englisch, Abkürzung Begriff,   Bundessprachenamt , p. 283, anti-tank ammunition. Most anti-tank guns were developed in the 1930s as improvements in tanks were noted,  and nearly every major arms manufacturer produced one type or another.     Anti-tank guns deployed during World War II were manned by specialist infantry rather than artillery crews, and issued to infantry units accordingly. The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used 37mm ammunition, except for the  |British_Army|British_Army| , which had developed the 40mm  |Ordnance_QF_2-pounder|Ordnance_Qf_2-Pounder| . As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger calibre and more effective armor-piercing shells. Although a number of large caliber guns were developed during the war that were capable of knocking out the most heavily armored tanks, they proved slow to set up and difficult to conceal. The latter generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles the size of an artillery shell to be fired from a mans shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantrymen.               The RPG has its roots in the 20th century with the early development of the explosive  |shaped_charge|Shaped_Charge| , in which the explosive is made with a conical hollow, which concentrates its power on the impact point. Before the adoption of the shaped charge,  |anti-tank_guns|Anti-Tank_Gun|  and  |tank_guns|Tank_Gun|  relied primarily on  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of metal shells to defeat armor. Soldier-carried anti-tank rifles such as the  |Boys_anti-tank_rifle|Boys_Anti-Tank_Rifle|  could be used against lightly-armored tankettes and light armored vehicles. However, as tank armor increased in thickness and effectiveness, the anti-tank guns needed to defeat them became increasingly heavy, cumbersome and expensive. During WW II, as tank armor got thicker, larger calibre anti-tank guns were developed to defeat this thicker armor.     While larger anti-tank guns were more effective, the weight of these anti-tank guns meant that they increasingly were mounted on wheeled, towed platforms. This meant that if the infantry was on foot, they might not have access to these wheeled, vehicle-towed anti-tank guns. This led to situations where infantry could find themselves defenseless against tanks and unable to attack tanks. Armies found that they needed to give infantry a human-portable weapon to defeat enemy armor when no wheeled anti-tank guns were available, since  |anti_tank_rifles|Anti-Tank_Rifle|  were no longer effective. Initial attempts to put such weapons in the hands of the infantry resulted in weapons like the Soviet  |RPG-40|Rpg-40|  blast effect hand grenade . The later  |RPG-43|Rpg-43|  and  |RPG-6|Rpg-6|  used shaped charges, the chemical energy of their explosive being used more efficiently to enable the defeat of thicker armor; however, being hand thrown weapons, they still had to be deployed at suicidally close range to be effective. What was needed was a means of delivering the shaped charge warhead from a distance. Different approaches to this goal would lead to the anti-tank  |spigot_mortar|Spigot_Mortar| , the  |recoilless_rifle|Recoilless_Rifle|  and, from the development of practical  |rocket|Rocket| ry, the rocket propelled grenade.     Research occasioned by  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  produced such weapons as the American  |Bazooka|Bazooka|  and German  |Panzerfaust|Panzerfaust| , which combined portability with effectiveness against armored vehicles, such as tanks. The  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| -developed  |RPG-7|Rpg-7|  is the most widely distributed, recognizable and used RPG in the world. The basic design of this RPG was developed by the Soviets shortly after  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii|  in the form of the  |RPG-2|Rpg-2| , which is similar in function to the Bazooka and the Panzerfaust , though the rounds it fires lack a form of propulsion in addition to the launch charge .        Soviet RPGs were used extensively during the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  , as well as during the  |Soviet_invasion_of_Afghanistan|Soviet_Invasion_Of_Afghanistan|  by the  |Mujahideen|Mujahideen|  and against South Africans in  |Angola|Angola|  and  |Namibia|Namibia|   by  |SWAPO|Swapo|  guerillas during what the South Africans called the  |South_African_Border_War|South_African_Border_War| . In the 2000s, they were still being used widely in conflict areas such as  |Chechnya|Chechnya| ,  |Iraq|Iraq| , and  |Sri_Lanka|Sri_Lanka| . Militants have also used RPGs against helicopters:  |Taliban|Taliban|  fighters shot down U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopters in June 2005 and August 2011; and  |Somali|Somalia|  militiamen shot down two U.S.  |UH-60_Black_Hawk|Uh-60_Black_Hawk|  helicopters during the  |Battle_of_Mogadishu|Battle_Of_Mogadishu|  in 1993.               The RPG warhead being used against tanks and other armor often has a  |shaped_charge|Shaped_Charge|  explosive warhead. A shaped charge is an  |explosive|Explosive|  charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosives energy. Various types are used to penetrate tank armor; typical modern lined shaped charge can penetrate steel armor to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge , though greater depths of 10 CD and above have been achieved. Despite the popular misconception that shaped charges melt tank armor, the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the  |superplastic|Superplastic|  metal jet from a shaped charge impact on armor forms mainly due to a sudden and intense  |mechanical_stress|Stress|  and does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely due to kinetic energy in nature.     An RPG comprises two main parts: the launcher and a rocket equipped with a warhead. The most common types of warheads are  |high_explosive|High_Explosive|  and  |high_explosive_anti-tank|High_Explosive_Anti-Tank|  rounds. HE rounds can be used against troops or unarmored structures or vehicles. HEAT rounds can be used against armored vehicles. These warheads are affixed to a  |rocket_motor|Rocket_Motor|  and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are single-use disposable units, such as the  |RPG-22|Rpg-22|  and  |M72_LAW|M72_Law| ; with these units, once the rocket is fired, the entire launcher is disposed of. Others are reloadable, such as the  |Soviet|Soviet_Union| |RPG-7|Rpg-7|  and the Israeli  |B-300|B-300| . With reloadable RPGs, a new rocket can be inserted into the muzzle of the weapon after firing.     The launcher is designed so that the rocket exits the launcher without discharging an exhaust that would be dangerous to the operator . In the case of the RPG-7, the rocket is launched by a  |gunpowder|Gunpowder|  booster charge, and the rocket motor ignites only after 10  metres. In some other designs, the propellant charge burns completely within the tube.     An RPG is an inexpensive way of delivering an explosive payload or warhead over a distance with moderate accuracy. Substantially more expensive guided  |anti-tank_missiles|Anti-Tank_Missile|  are used at larger distances or when accuracy is paramount. Some anti-tank missiles, such as the  |Sagger|At-3_Sagger| , can be guided after firing by the operator. An RPG is not normally guided towards the target by heat sensors or IR signatures. Nor can most RPG rockets be controlled in flight after being aimed and launched. While the lack of active targeting technologies or after-firing guidance input can be viewed as a challenge or weak point, it also makes it hard to defend against RPGs with electronic countermeasures, jamming or similar approaches. For example, if a soldier or other fighter launches an RPG at a hovering helicopter, even if the helicopter releases chaff flares, engages in signal jamming or releases radar-fooling foil, this will have no effect on a typical RPG warhead in flight, even if these measures might protect against more sophisticated surface-to-air missiles.                The HEAT  round is a standard shaped charge warhead, similar in concept to those used in many tank cannon rounds. In this type of warhead, the shape of the explosive material within the warhead focuses the explosive energy on a copper lining. This heats the metal lining and propels some of it forward at a very high velocity in a highly plastic state. The resulting narrow jet of metal can defeat armor equivalent to several hundred millimeters of RHA, such as that used in light and medium armored vehicles. However, heavily armored vehicles, such as main battle tanks, are generally too well armored to be penetrated by an RPG, unless weaker sections of the armor are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems and other soft targets. The warhead detonates on impact or when the fuse runs out; usually the fuse is set to the maximum burn of the rocket motor, but it can be shortened for  |improvised_anti_aircraft|Battle_Of_Mogadishu|  purposes.     Specialized warheads are available for illumination, smoke, tear gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a  |fuel-air_explosive|Thermobaric_Weapon|  warhead. Another recent development is a tandem HEAT warhead capable of penetrating  |reactive_armor|Reactive_Armor| .     So-called PRIGs were improvised warheads used by the  |Provisional_IRA|Provisional_Ira| .         The  |RPG-29|Rpg-29|  uses a  |tandem-charge|Tandem-Charge| |high_explosive_anti-tank|High_Explosive_Anti-Tank|  warhead to penetrate  |explosive_reactive_armor|Explosive_Reactive_Armor|  as well as composite armor behind it. It is capable of penetrating MBTs, such as the  |M1_Abrams|M1_Abrams| , older model Mark II version of the  |Merkava|Merkava| ,  |Challenger_2|Challenger_2|  and  |T-90|T-90| .      In August 2006, in  |al-Amarah|Al-Amarah| , in Iraq, a Soviet RPG-29 damaged the front underside of a Challenger 2 tank, detonating ERA in the area of the drivers cabin. The driver lost part of a foot and two more of the crew were injured, but the driver was able to reverse  to an aid post. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations, the MoD said We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable. Since then, the ERA has been replaced with a  |Dorchester_block|Chobham_Armour|  and the steel underbelly lined with armor, as part of the Streetfighter upgrade, which was a direct response to this incident. In May 2008,  The New York Times  disclosed that an American M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq. The American army is ranking the  |RPG-29|Rpg-29|  threat to American armor as high; they have refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into the hands of insurgents.     Various armies and manufacturers have developed add-on tank armor and other systems for  |urban_combat|Urban_Warfare| , such as the  |Tank_Urban_Survival_Kit|Tank_Urban_Survival_Kit|  for M1 Abrams,  |slat_armor|Slat_Armor|  for the  |Stryker|Stryker| , ERA kit for the  |FV432|Fv432_Afv| , AZUR for  |Leclerc|Leclerc_Tank| , and others. Similar solutions are  |active_protection_systems|Active_Protection_System|  , engaging and destroying closing projectiles, such as the Russian  |Drozd|Drozd|  and  |Arena|Arena_Active_Protection_System| , as well as the recent Israeli  |TROPHY_Active_Protection_System|Trophy_Active_Protection_System| .     The  |RPG-30|Rpg-30|  was designed to address the threat of active protection systems on tanks by using a false target to trick the APS. The RPG-30 shares a close resemblance with the  |RPG-27|Rpg-27|  in that it is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single shot capacity. However, unlike the RPG-27, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a smaller side barrel tube in addition to the main round in the main tube. This precursor round acts as a false target, tricking the targets active protection system into engaging it, allowing the main round a clear path into the target, while the APS is stuck in the 0.2–0.4 second delay it needs to start its next engagement. Recent German systems were able to reduce reaction delay to mere milliseconds, cancelling this advantage.     The PG-30 is the main round of the RPG-30. The round is a 105-mm tandem shaped charge with a weight of 10.3-kg and has a range of 200 meters and a stated penetration capability in excess of 600-mm  |rolled_homogeneous_armor|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  , 1500-mm reinforced concrete, 2000-mm brick and 3700-mm of soil. Reactive armor, including explosive reactive armor , can be defeated with multiple hits into the same place, such as by tandem-charge weapons, which fire two or more shaped charges in rapid succession.         An early method of disabling shaped charges developed during World War II was to apply thin skirt armor or meshwire at a distance around the hull and turret of the tank. The skirt or mesh armor  triggers the RPG on contact and much of the molten jet that a shaped charge produces dissipates before coming into contact with the main armor of the vehicle. Well-sloped armor also gives some protection because the shaped charge is forced to penetrate a greater amount of armor due to the oblique angle. The benefits of cage armor are still considered great in modern battlefields in the Middle East, and although similar effects can be obtained using  |spaced_armor|Spaced_Armor| , either as a part of the original design or as  |appliqué_armor|Appliqué_Armorappliqué_Armour|  fitted later, cage armor is preferable due to its low weight and ease of repair.     Today, technologically advanced armies have implemented  |composite_armors|Composite_Armor|  such as  |Chobham_armor|Chobham_Armor| , which provide superior protection to steel. For added protection, vehicles may be retrofitted with reactive armor; on impact, reactive tiles explode or deform, disrupting the normal function of the shaped charge. Russian and Israeli vehicles also use active protection systems such as Drozd, Arena APS or Trophy. Such a system detects and shoots down incoming projectiles before they reach the vehicle. As in all arms races, these developments in armor countermeasures have led to the development of RPG rounds designed specifically to defeat them, with methods such as a tandem-charge warhead, which has two shaped charges, of which the first is meant to activate any reactive armor, and the second to penetrate the vehicle.             The  |United_States_Army|United_States_Army|  developed a lightweight antitank weapon in the middle 1950s. By 1961, the  |M72_LAW|M72_Law|  was in use. It is a shoulder-fired, disposable rocket launcher with HEAT warhead. It is a recoilless weapon, which is easy to use, and effective against armored vehicles. It was used during the Vietnam War, and is still in use today. It uses a fin-stabilized rocket. In response to the threat of thicker armor, this weapon was replaced by the  |AT4|At4|  recoilless rifle, a larger & non-collapsible  – albeit still single-shot weapon.     The  |United_States_Marine_Corps|United_States_Marine_Corps|  uses a different launcher, which is reloadable  – the  |Shoulder-Launched_Multipurpose_Assault_Weapon|Shoulder-Launched_Multipurpose_Assault_Weapon|  . Unlike the RPG, it is reloaded from the breech-end rather than the muzzle.      |Bazooka|Bazooka| |M72_LAW|M72_Law| |Mk_153_Shoulder-Launched_Multipurpose_Assault_Weapon|Mk_153_Shoulder-Launched_Multipurpose_Assault_Weapon| |M141_Bunker_Defeat_Munition|M141_Bunker_Defeat_Munition| |PSRL-1|Psrl-1| |Specific_types_of_RPGs_include|List_Of_Equipment_Of_The_Russian_Ground_Forces| |RPG-7|Rpg-7| |thermobaric|Thermobaric_Weapon|  rocket and OG-7V  |fragmentation|Fragmentation|  grenade    |RPG-27|Rpg-27|  Tavolga : One-shot disposable RPG launcher, RShG-1  |thermobaric|Thermobaric_Weapon|  rockets    |RShG-1|Rshg-1| |RShG-2|Rshg-2| |RPG-29|Rpg-29|  Vampir : Reloadable RPG launcher, TBG-29  |thermobaric|Thermobaric_Weapon|  rockets    |RPO_Rys|Rpo_Rys| |RPO-A_Shmel|Rpo-A_Shmel| |MGK_Bur|Mgk_Bur| |RPO-M|Rpo-M| |MRO-A|Mro-A| |RPG-1|Rpg-1| |RPG-2|Rpg-2| |RPG-7|Rpg-7| |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration, PG-7VR with ≈600  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration after  |ERA|Reactive_Armor| |RPG-16|Rpg-16| |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration, higher accuracy and four times the range of the  |RPG-7|Rpg-7| |RPG-18|Rpg-18|  Muha : One-shot disposable RPG launcher, PG-18 with ≈375  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration    |RPG-22|Rpg-22|  Netto : One-shot disposable RPG launcher, PG-22 with ≈400  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration    |RPG-26|Rpg-26|  Aglen : One-shot disposable RPG launcher, PG-26 with ≈500  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration    |RPG-27|Rpg-27|  Tavolga : One-shot disposable RPG launcher, PG-27 with ≈750  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration after  |ERA|Reactive_Armor| |RPG-28|Rpg-28| |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration after  |ERA|Reactive_Armor| |RPG-29|Rpg-29|  Vampir : Reloadable RPG launcher, PG-29V with ≈750  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration after  |ERA|Reactive_Armor| |RPG-30|Rpg-30|  One-shot disposable RPG launcher, with a precursor forerunner additional sub-munition, intended to defeat Active Defense Systems like  |Trophy|Trophy| . ≈650  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration after active protection.    |RPG-32|Rpg-32|  Hashim : Latest variant of RPG 105  mm Caliber, PG-32V with ≈650  mm  |RHA|Rolled_Homogeneous_Armor|  penetration    |Bunker_buster|Bunker_Buster| |LRAC_F1|Lrac_F1| |Raketenpanzerbüchse_Panzerschreck|Raketenpanzerbüchse_Panzerschreck| |Panzerfaust|Panzerfaust| |Panzerfaust_2|Panzerfaust_2| |Panzerfaust_3|Panzerfaust_3| |B-300|B-300| |IMI_Shipon|Imi_Shipon| |MATADOR|Matador| |AT4|At4| |C90-CR|C90-Cr| |RPG-75|Rpg-75| |RPG-76_Komar|Rpg-76_Komar| |M90_Stršljen|M90_Stršljen| |M79_Osa|M79_Osa| |M80_Zolja|M80_Zolja| |Type_69_RPG|Type_69_Rpg| |PF-89|Pf-89| |Al-Bana|Al-Bana| |Batar|Batar| |Yasin|Yasin| |RK-4_Ingul|Rk-4_Ingul|             One of the first instances the weapon was used by militants was on 13 January 1975 at  |Orly_Airport|Orly_Airport|  in France, when  |Carlos_the_Jackal|Carlos_The_Jackal| , together with another member from the  |PFLP|Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine| , used two Soviet RPG-7 grenades to attack an Israeli  |El_Al|El_Al|  airliner. Both missed the target, with one hitting a  |Yugoslav_Airliness|Yugoslav_Airlines| |DC-9|Dc-9|  instead.     In Afghanistan,  |Mujahideen|Mujahideen|  guerrillas used RPG-7s to destroy  |Soviet|Soviet_Union|  vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG shooters would be assigned to each vehicle. Each armored-vehicle hunter-killer team can have as many as 15 RPGs. In areas where vehicles were confined to a single path , RPG teams trapped convoys by destroying the first and last vehicles in line, preventing movement of the other vehicles. This tactic was especially effective in cities. Convoys learned to avoid approaches with overhangs and to send infantrymen forward in hazardous areas to detect the RPG teams.     Multiple shooters were also effective against heavy tanks with  |reactive_armor|Reactive_Armor|  An earlier anti-aircraft kill by the Taliban occurred during Operation Red Wings, on 28 June 2005 when a Chinook helicopter was destroyed by unguided rocket propelled grenades.     In the  |period_following_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq|History_Of_Iraq| , the RPG became a favorite weapon of the insurgent forces fighting U.S. troops. Since most of the readily-available  |RPG-7|Rpg-7|  rounds cannot penetrate  |M1_Abrams|M1_Abrams|  tank armor from almost any angle, it is primarily effective against soft-skinned or lightly armored vehicles, and infantry. Even if the RPG hit does not completely disable the tank or kill the crew, it can still damage external equipment, lowering the tanks effectiveness or forcing the crew to abandon and destroy it. Newer RPG-7 rounds are more capable, and in August 2006, an RPG-29 round penetrated the frontal ERA of a  |Challenger_2|Challenger_2|  tank during an engagement in  |al-Amarah|Al-Amarah| ,  |Iraq|Iraq| , and wounded several crew members.     RPGs were a main tool used by the  |FMLNs|Fmln|  guerrilla forces in the  |Salvadoran_Civil_War|Salvadoran_Civil_War| . For example, during the June 19, 1986 overrun of the San Miguel Army base, FMLN sappers dressed only in black shorts, their faces blacked out with grease, sneaked through barbed wire at night, avoiding the searchlights, they made it to within firing range of the outer wall. Using RPGs to initiate the attack, they blew through the wall and killed a number of Salvadorean soldiers. They eliminated the outermost sentries and searchlights with the rockets, then made it into the inner wall, which they also punched through. They were then able to create mayhem as their comrades attacked from the outside.     During the  |First|First_Chechen_War|  and  |Second_Chechen_Wars|Second_Chechen_War|  ,  |Chechen|Chechnya|  rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was effective because tank main guns could not be depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very top and bottom of tanks is usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on  |artillery|Artillery|  suppression, good crew gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached  |self-propelled_anti-aircraft_guns|Self-Propelled_Anti-Aircraft_Gun|   used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent cells that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG . The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed good shots at the weakest armor . When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with  |explosive_reactive_armor|Reactive_Armor|  , the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.     Using RPGs as improvized anti-aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan and Chechnya.  |Helicopters|Helicopter|  are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover. In  |Afghanistan|Afghanistan| , the  |Mujahideen|Mujahideen|  often modified RPGs for use against Soviet helicopters by adding a curved pipe to the rear of the launcher tube, which diverted the backblast, allowing the RPG to be fired upward at aircraft from a prone position. This made the operator less visible prior to firing and decreased the risk of injury from hot exhaust gases. The Mujahideen also utilized the 4.5-second timer on RPG rounds to make the weapon function as part of a  |flak|Flak|  battery, using multiple launchers to increase hit probabilities. At the time, Soviet helicopters countered the threat from RPGs at landing zones by first clearing them with anti-personnel  |saturation_fire|Suppression_Fire| . The Soviets also varied the number of accompanying helicopters in an effort to upset Afghan force estimations and preparation. In response, the Mujahideen prepared dug-in firing positions with top cover, and again, Soviet forces altered their tactics by using air-dropped  |thermobaric_fuel-air_bombs|Thermobaric_Weapon|  on such landing zones. As the U.S.-supplied  |Stinger|Fim-92_Stinger| |surface-to-air_missiles|Surface-To-Air_Missile|  became available to them, the Afghans abandoned RPG attacks as the smart missiles proved especially efficient in the destruction of unarmed Soviet transport helicopters, such as  |Mil_Mi-17|Mil_Mi-17| . In  |Somalia|Somalia| , both of the  |UH-60_Black_Hawk|Uh-60_Black_Hawk|  helicopters lost by U.S. forces during the  |Battle_of_Mogadishu|Battle_Of_Mogadishu| .
