This is what is happening with the triangle above, but any other set would suffice.          If one takes a point and applies each of the transformations d A , d B , and d C to it randomly, the resulting points will be dense in the Sierpinski triangle, so the following algorithm will again generate arbitrarily close approximations to it: .     Start by labeling p 1 , p 2 and p 3 as the corners of the Sierpinski triangle, and a random point v 1 . Set , where r n  is a random number 1, 2 or 3. Draw the points v 1 to v ∞ . If the first point v 1 was a point on the Sierpiński triangle, then all the points v n lie on the Sierpinski triangle. If the first point v 1 to lie within the perimeter of the triangle is not a point on the Sierpinski triangle, none of the points v n will lie on the Sierpinski triangle, however they will converge on the triangle. If v 1 is outside the triangle, the only way v n will land on the actual triangle, is if v n is on what would be part of the triangle, if the triangle was infinitely large.                Or more simply:   Take three points in a plane to form a triangle, you need not draw it.   Randomly select any point inside the triangle and consider that your current position.   Randomly select any one of the three vertex points.   Move half the distance from your current position to the selected vertex.   Plot the current position.   Repeat from step 3.
