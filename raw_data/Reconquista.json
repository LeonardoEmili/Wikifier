The concept of a Christian reconquest of the peninsula first emerged, in tenuous form, at the end of the 9th century.  A landmark was set by the Christian  Chronica Prophetica  , a document stressing the Christian and Muslim cultural and religious divide in Iberia and the necessity to drive the Muslims out.          Both Christian and Muslim rulers fought amongst themselves. Alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon. Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious tolerance.

In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of Reconquista as a concept created a posteriori in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests.

Usually adorned with geometric designs, crosses or tassels, shields were made out of wood and had a leather cover.     Steel swords were the most common weapon. The cavalry used long double-edged swords and the infantry short, single-edged ones. Guards were either semicircular or straight, but always highly ornamented with geometrical patterns. Spears and javelins were up to 1.5 metres long and had an iron tip. The double-axe – made of iron, 30  cm long, and possessing an extremely sharp edge – was designed to be equally useful as a thrown weapon or in close combat. Maces and hammers were not common, but some specimens have remained and are thought to have been used by members of the cavalry.

This style of warfare remained dominant in the Iberian Peninsula until the late 11th century, when lance tactics entered from France, although the traditional horse javelin-shot techniques continued to be used. In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.          Shields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the familys coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, a la jineta , a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, a la brida, a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.     Around the 14th and 15th centuries heavy cavalry gained a predominant role, where knights used to wear full plate armors.

After an initial phase of military conquest, Christians states incorporated the conquered land. When large frontier regions were incorporated at once, the land was mostly given to the nobility and the military orders, with negative effects on long-term development. The incorporation of small regions, on the other hand, generally allowed for the participation of individual settlers and was more likely to fall under the auspices of the crown. This led to a more equitable distribution of land and greater social equality, with positive effects on long-term development.           On the conclusion of Iberian victory over the Moors, the Iberian powers, Spain and Portugal didnt stop their warring against the Muslims solely in their homelands—they extended the conflict against Islam overseas.
