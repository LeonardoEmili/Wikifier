   Clodius is an alternate form of the  |Roman|Ancient_Rome|   nomen   |Claudius|Claudius| , a  |patrician|Patrician|   gens  that was traditionally regarded as  |Sabine|Sabine|  in origin. The alternation of o and au is characteristic of the Sabine dialect. The  |feminine_form|Grammatical_Gender|  is Clodia.              During the  |Late_Republic|Roman_Republic| , the spelling Clodius is most prominently associated with  |Publius_Clodius_Pulcher|Publius_Clodius_Pulcher| , a  |popularis|Populares|  politician who gave up his patrician status through  |an_order|Roman_Adoption|  in order to qualify for the office of  |tribune_of_the_plebs|Tribuneplebeian_Tribune| . Clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban  plebs , supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds ; because of this individuals ideology, Clodius has often been taken as a more plebeian spelling and a gesture of political solidarity. Clodiuss two elder brothers, the  |Appius_Claudius_Pulcher|Appius_Claudius_Pulcher|  who was  |consul|Roman_Consul|  in 54 BC and the  |C._Claudius_Pulcher|Gaius_Claudius_Pulcher|  who was praetor in 56 BC, conducted more conventional political careers and are referred to in contemporary sources with the traditional spelling.     The view that Clodius represents a plebeian or politicized form has been questioned by Clodiuss chief modern-era biographer. In The Patrician Tribune, W. Jeffrey Tatum points out that the spelling is also associated with Clodiuss sisters and that the political explanation … is almost certainly wrong. A plebeian branch of the gens, the Claudii Marcelli, retained the supposedly patrician spelling, while there is some  |inscriptional|Epigraphy|  evidence that the -o- form may also have been used on occasion by close male relatives of the patrician tribune Clodius. Tatum argues that the use of -o- by the chic  |Clodia_Metelli|Clodia_Metelli|  was a fashionable affectation, and that Clodius, whose perhaps inordinately loving relationship with his sister was the subject of much gossip and insinuation, was imitating his stylish sibling. The  |linguistic_variation_of_o_for_au|Claudius_Etymology|  was characteristic of the  |Umbrian_language|Umbrian_Language| , of which  |Sabine|Sabine|  was a branch. Forms using o were considered archaic or rustic in the 50s BC, and the use of Clodius would have been either a whimsical gesture of  |pastoral_fantasy|Pastoral| , or a trendy assertion of  |antiquarian|Antiquarianism|  authenticity. W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher , pp. 247–248  The idea that the form Clodius announced ethnic identity is suggested also by Gary D. Farney, Ethnic identity and aristocratic competition in Republican Rome , p. 89        In addition to Clodius, Clodii from the Republican era include:      |Clodia_Metelli|Claudia_Pulchra| . sister of  |Publius_Clodius_Pulcher|Publius_Clodius_Pulcher| |Clodius_Aesopus|Clodius_Aesopus| , a tragic actor in the 50s BC who may have been a  |freedman|Freedman|  of one of the Clodii Pulchri.    |Clodia_Pulchra|Claudia_Pulchra| , daughter of Clodius Pulcher and  |Fulvia|Fulvia| , the first wife of imperator August.    |Clodia_Pulchra|Clodia_Pulchra| , daughter of Appius Clodius Pulcher, sometimes identified in  |Catullus|Catullus|  poems as  |Lesbia|Lesbia|  .          People using the name Clodius during the period of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire|  include:    |Caius_Clodius_Vestalis|Caius_Clodius_Vestalis| , possible builder of the  |Via_Clodia|Via_Clodia| |Publius_Clodius_Thrasea_Paetus|Publius_Clodius_Thrasea_Paetus| , senator and philosopher during the reign of  |Nero|Nero| |Lucius_Clodius_Macer|Lucius_Clodius_Macer| , a  legatus  who revolted against Nero    |Publius_Clodius_Quirinalis|Publius_Clodius_Quirinalis| , from  |Arelate|Arelate|  in  |Gaul|Gaul| , teacher of  |rhetoric|Rhetoric|  in time of  |Nero|Nero| |Clodius_Albinus|Clodius_Albinus| , rival emperor 196-197   Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus, known as  |Pupienus|Pupienus| , co-emperor 238    |Quintus_Clodius_Hermogenianus_Olybrius|Quintus_Clodius_Hermogenianus_Olybrius| , consul 379       The Clodii Celsini continued to practice the  |traditional_religions_of_antiquity|Ancient_Roman_Religion|  in the face of  |Christian_hegemony|Decline_Of_Greco-Roman_Polytheism|  through at least the 4th century, when Clodius Celsinus Adelphius  |converted|Religious_Conversion| .
