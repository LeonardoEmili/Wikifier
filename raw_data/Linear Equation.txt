      In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a linear equation is an  |equation|Equation|  that may be put in the form   : a1x1+  +anxn+b0,   where x1,   xn are the  |variables|Variable|  , and b, a1,   an are the  |coefficients|Coefficient| , which are often  |real_numbers|Real_Number| . The coefficients may be considered as  |parameters|Parameter|  of the equation, and may be arbitrary  |expressions|Expression| , provided they do not contain any of the variables. To yield a meaningful equation, the coefficient s a1,   an are required to not be all zero.     In other words, a linear equation is obtained by equating to zero a  |linear_polynomial|Linear_Polynomial|  over some  |field|Field| , from which the coefficients are taken .     The  |solutions|Solution|  of such an equation are the values that, when substituted for the unknowns, make the equality true.     In the case of just one variable, there is exactly one solution . Often, the term linear equation refers implicitly to this particular case, in which the variable is sensibly called the unknown.     In the case of two variables, each solution may be interpreted as the  |Cartesian_coordinates|Cartesian_Coordinates|  of a point of the  |Euclidean_plane|Euclidean_Plane| . The solutions of a linear equation form a  |line|Line|  in the Euclidean plane, and, conversely, every line can be viewed as the set of all solutions of a linear equation in two variables. This is the origin of the term linear for describing this type of equations. More generally, the solutions of a linear equation in  variables form a  |hyperplane|Hyperplane|   in the  |Euclidean_space|Euclidean_Space|  of dimension .     Linear equations occur frequently in all mathematics and their applications in  |physics|Physics|  and  |engineering|Engineering| , partly because  |non_linear_systems|Non_Linear_System|  are often well approximated by linear equations.     This article considers the case of a single equation with coefficients from the field of  |real_numbers|Real_Number| , for which one studies the real solutions. All of its content applies to  |complex|Complex_Number|  solutions and, more generally, for linear equations with coefficients and solutions in any  |field|Field| . For the case of several simultaneous linear equations, see  |system_of_linear_equations|System_Of_Linear_Equations| .       Frequently the term linear equation refers implicitly to the case of just one variable.     In this case, the equation can be put in the form   : ax+b0,   and it has a unique solution   : x-  ba   in the general case where .   In this case, the name unknown is sensibly given to the variable .     If , there are two cases. Either  equals also 0, and every number is a solution. Otherwise , and there is no solution. In this latter case, the equation is said to be  |inconsistent|Inconsistent_Equations| .       In the case of two variables, any linear equation can be put in the form   : ax+by+c0,   where the variables are  and , and the coefficients are ,  and .     An equivalent equation is   : Ax + By C,   with , and      These equivalent variants are sometimes given generic names, such as general form or standard form.      There are other forms for a linear equation , which can all be transformed in the standard form with simple algebraic manipulations, such as adding the same quantity to both members of the equation, or multiplying both members by the same nonzero constant.          If , the equation   : ax+by+c0   is a linear equation in the single variable  for every value of . It has therefore a unique solution for , which is given by   : y-  ab x-  cb.     This defines a  |function|Function| . The  |graph|Graph_Of_A_Function|  of this function is a  |line|Line|  with  |slope|Slope|  -  ab and  |_intercept|Y_Intercept|  -  cb. The functions whose graph is a line are generally called linear functions in the context of  |calculus|Calculus| . However, in  |linear_algebra|Linear_Algebra| , a  |linear_function|Linear_Function|  is a function that maps a sum to the sum of the images of the summands. So, for this definition, the above function is linear only when , that is when the line passes through the origin. For avoiding confusion, the functions whose graph is an arbitrary line are often called affine functions.             Each solution  of a linear equation   : ax+by+c0   may be viewed as the  |Cartesian_coordinates|Cartesian_Coordinates|  of a point in the  |Euclidean_plane|Euclidean_Plane| . With this interpretation, all solutions of the equation form a  |line|Line| , provided that  and  are not both zero. Conversely, every line is the set of all solutions of a linear equation.     The phrase linear equation takes its origin in this correspondence between lines and equations: a linear equation in two variables is an equation whose solutions form a line.     If , the line is the  |graph_of_the_function|Graph_Of_A_Function|  of  that has been defined in the preceding section. If , the line is a vertical line  of equation x-  ca, which is not the graph of a function of .     Similarly, if , the line is the graph of a function of , and, if , one has a horizontal line of equation y-  cb.       There are various ways of defining a line. In the following subsections, a linear equation of the line is given in each case.       A non-vertical line can be defined by its  |slope_|Slope|  , and its  |_intercept|Y_Intercept|   . In this case its linear equation can be written   : ymx+y0.     If, moreover, the line is not horizontal, it can be defined by its slope and its -intercept . In this case, its equation can be written   : ym,   or, equivalently,   : ymx-mx0.     These form rely on the habit of considering a non vertical line as the  |graph_of_a_function|Graph_Of_A_Function| .  For a line given by an equation   : ax+by+c,   these forms can be easily deduced from the relations   :     m & -  ab,    x0 & -  ca,    y0 & -  cb.             A non-vertical line can be defined by its  |slope_|Slope|  , and the coordinates x1, y1 of any point of the line. In this case, a linear equation of the line is   : yy1 + m,   or   : ymx +y1-mx1.     This equation can also be written   : y-y1m   for emphasizing that the slope of a line can be computed from the coordinates of any two points.       A line that is not parallel to an axis and does not pass through the origin cuts the axes in two different points. The  |intercept_values|Y_Intercept|   and  of these two points are nonzero, and an equation of the line is    :   +   1.   .       Given two different points  and , there is exactly one line that passes through them. There are several ways to write a linear equation of is line.     If , the slope of the line is   Thus, a point-slope form is   : y - y1   .     By  |clearing_denominators|Clearing_Denominators| , one gets the equation   : - 0,   which is valid also when  .     This form is not symmetric in the two given points, but a symmetric form can be obtained by regrouping the constant terms:   : x + y + 0   .       The two-point form of the equation of a line can be expressed simply in terms of a  |determinant|Determinant| . There are two common ways for that.     The equation - 0 is the result of expanding the determinant in the equation   :   & y-y1  & y2-y1      The equation x + y + 0 can be obtained be expanding with respect to its first row the determinant in the equation   :     x & y & 1    x1 & y1 & 1    x2 & y2 & 1         Beside being very simple and mnemonic, this form has the advantage of being a special case of the more general equation of a  |hyperplane|Hyperplane|  passing through  points in a space of dimension . These equations rely on the condition of  |linear_dependence|Linear_Dependence|  of points in a  |projective_space|Projective_Space| .       A linear equation with more than two variables may always be assumed to have the form   : a1 x1 + a2 x2 +   + an xn + b0.     The coefficient , often denoted  is called the constant term, sometimes the absolute term,.
