     In  |musical_notation|Musical_Notation| , a key signature is a set of  |sharp|Sharp|  ,  |flat|Flat|  , and rarely,  |natural|Natural|   symbols placed together on the  |staff|Staff| . Key signatures are generally written immediately after the  |clef|Clef|  at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a  |score|Sheet_Music| , notably after a  |double_barline|Bar| .     A key signature designates  |notes|Note|  that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding  |natural|Natural_Sign|  notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature. A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one  |semitone|Semitone|  above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone. Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the  |treble_staff|Cleftreble_Clef|  applies to Fs not only on that line, but also to Fs in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other Fs. This convention was not universal until the late  |Baroque|Baroque_Music|  and early  |Classical_period|Classical_Period| , however; music published in the 1720s and 1730s, for example, uses key signatures showing sharps or flats on both octaves for notes which fall within the staff.     An  |accidental|Accidental|  is an exception to the key signature, applying only to the measure and octave in which it appears.     Although a key signature may be written using any combination of sharp and flat symbols, the most common series of thirteen homogeneous key signatures—ranging from six flats to six sharps, with each successive flat or sharp placed on the  |note_a_perfect_fifth_below_or_above|Circle_Of_Fifths| , respectively, the previous one—is assumed in much of this article. A piece scored using a single diatonic key signature and no accidentals contains notes of at most seven of the twelve  |pitch_class|Pitch_Class| es, which seven being determined by the particular key signature.     Each  |major|Major_Scale|  and  |minor|Minor_Scale| |key|Key|  has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale. However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces, Schulenberg, David. Music of the Baroque. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. . to determine the key of a Baroque work one must always analyze its tonal structure rather than rely on the key signature. or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes. Cooper, David. The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland. Cork: Cork University Press, 2005. . In a few cases Petrie has given what is clearly a modal melody a key signature which suggests that it is actually in a minor key. For example, Banish Misfortune is presented in D minor, although it is clearly in the Dorian mode.     Later on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common ; but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethovens very late piano sonatas. For example, in his  |Sonata_No._31_in_A_major,_Op._110|Piano_Sonata_No._31| , the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A minor and has a significant modulation to C major, and both these keys theoretically require seven flats in their key signature.                 In principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern  |music_notation|Music_Notationmodern_Notation| . This allows musicians to identify the key simply by the number of sharps or flats , rather than their position on the staff. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an  |F-sharp|F♯| ,  url  |G_major|G_Major|  or an  |E_minor|E_Minor|  key.     However, in 20th-century music, there are occasional exceptions to this, where a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale, where a key signature may be invented to reflect this. This may consist of a number of sharps or flats that are not the normal ones , or it may consist of one or more sharps combined with one or more flats . Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of  |Béla_Bartók|Béla_Bartók| , for example.     The effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any  |octave|Octave|  will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental .     In a score containing more than one instrument, all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature. Exceptions include:   If an instrument is a  |transposing_instrument|Transposing_Instrument| .   If an instrument is a  |percussion_instrument|Percussion_Instrument|  with indeterminate pitch.   Composers usually omit the key signature for  |timpani|Timpani|  parts. Besides not using a key signature, timpani parts were early on also treated often as transposing instrument parts, the pitch of the high drum being written as C and, as timpani were almost always tuned a  |perfect_fourth|Perfect_Fourth|  apart , the pitch of the low drum being written as G, with the actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the part, e.g. timpani in D–A , if they were tuned A and D .   Composers may omit the key signature for  |horn|French_Horn|  and occasionally  |trumpet|Trumpet|  parts. This is perhaps reminiscent of the early days of brass instruments, when  |crooks|Crook|  would be added to them, in order to change the length of the tubing and allow playing in different keys.  |polytonal|Polytonal|  and the different parts are actually in different keys which sound together.              The convention for the notation of key signatures follows the  |circle_of_fifths|Circle_Of_Fifths| . Starting from  |C_major|C_Major|   which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new keys  |leading_note|Leading_Note|  for major keys or  |supertonic|Supertonic|  for minor keys. Thus  |G_major|G_Major|   has one sharp which is on the F; then  |D_major|D_Major|   has two sharps on F and C and so on.     Similarly, successively lowering the key by a fifth adds a flat, going counterclockwise around the circle of fifths. The new flat is placed on the  |subdominant|Subdominant|  for major keys or  |submediant|Submediant|  for minor keys. Thus  |F_major|F_Major|   has one flat which is on the B; then  |B_major|B-Flat_Major|   has two flats and so on.     Put another way: for key signatures with sharps, the first sharp is placed on F with subsequent sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for key signatures with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional key signatures, with up to seven sharps or flats and including the empty signature of C major .     Corollaries:     Starting from a key with flats in its key signature: raising by fifths successively reduces the flats to zero at C major . Further such raising adds sharps as described above.   Starting from a key with sharps: lowering by fifths successively reduces those sharps to zero. Further such lowering adds flats as described above.   When the process of raising by a fifth produces more than five or six sharps, successive such raising generally involves changing to the  |enharmonic_equivalent|Enharmonic_Equivalent|  key using a flat-based signature. Typically this is at F    G, but may also be at C    D or B    C. The same principle applies to the process of successive lowering by a fifth.     The relative minor is a  |minor_third|Minor_Third|  down from the major, regardless of whether it is a flat or a sharp key signature.     The key signatures with seven flats  and seven sharps  are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of  |C_major|C-Sharp_Major|  is more simply represented as  |D_major|D-Flat_Major|  . For modern practical purposes these keys are  the same, because C and D are enharmonically the same note. Pieces are written in these extreme sharp or flat keys, however: for example,  |Bachs|Johann_Sebastian_Bach|  Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of  |The_Well-Tempered_Clavier|The_Well-Tempered_Clavier| |BWV_848|List_Of_Compositions_Of_Johann_Sebastian_Bachthe_Well-Tempered_Clavier_.28846.E2.80.93893.29|  is in C major. The modern musical  Seussical  by  |Flaherty|Stephen_Flaherty|  and  |Ahrens|Lynn_Ahrens|  also has several songs written in these extreme keys.     Key signatures can be further extended through  |double_sharps|Double_Sharp|  and  |double_flats|Double_Flat|  . As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used .        The key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a  |measure|Measure| , simply by notating the new signature; although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is needed to cancel the preceding signature. If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.         In traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.     Similarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.     When the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.     At one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a  |double_barline|Barline|  , even if it was not required by the structure of the music to mark sections within the movement; but more recently it has increasingly become usual to use just a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.     If both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed . For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.     In key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.     The A which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of  |Ottorino_Respighis|Ottorino_Respighi|   Pines of Rome , in the third section, Pines of the Janiculum , in the bass-clef instrumental parts.     In the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear below the bottom line. An example of this can be seen in  |Isaac_Albénizs|Isaac_Albéniz|   Iberia  |A|A-Flat_Minor|  minor.       Except for C major, key signatures appear in two varieties, sharp key signatures and flat key signatures , so called because they contain only one or other. Schonbrun, Marc . The Everything Music Theory Book, p.68. .         Sharp key signatures consist of a number of sharps between one and seven, applied in this order: . Bower, Michael. 2007.  .

Barnes & Noble Outline Series 137.  |New_York|New_York_City| , Hagerstown, San Francisco, London:  |Barnes_&_Noble|Barnes_&_Noble| . . A mnemonic device often used to remember this is Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle , or Father Christmas gave dad an electric blanket.  The key note or  |tonic|Tonic|  of a piece in a major key is immediately above the last sharp in the signature. Kennedy, Michael. 1994. Key-Signature . Oxford Dictionary of Music, second edition, associate editor, Joyce Bourne. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. . For example, one sharp  in the key signature of a piece in a major key indicates the key of G major, the next note above F.           This table shows that each scale starting on the  |fifth|Perfect_Fifth| |scale_degree|Scale_Degree|  of the previous scale has one new sharp, added in the order given above.       Flat key signatures consist of one to seven flats, applied as:  The mnemonic device is then reversed for use in the flat keys: Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles Father , or Blanket exploded and dad got cold feet. The major scale with one flat is F major. In all other flat major scales , the tonic or key note of a piece in a major key is four notes below the last flat, which is the same as the second-to-last flat in the signature. In the major key with four flats , for example, the penultimate flat is A, indicating a key of A major.          In this case each new scale starts a fifth below  the previous one.     key signature and key  |key|Key| ; key signatures are merely notational devices. They are convenient principally for  |diatonic|Diatonic|  or  |tonal|Tonality|  music.     The key signature defines the  |diatonic_scale|Diatonic_Scale|  that a piece of music uses without the need for accidentals. Most  |scales|Scale|  require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted. For example, the only sharp in the G  |major_scale|Major_Scale|  is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.     In any case, more extensive pieces often change key  during contrasting sections, and only sometimes is this change indicated with a change of key signature; if not, the passage in the second key will not have a matching key signature.          The  |Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_538|Toccata_And_Fugue_In_D_Minor,_Bwv_538|  by  |Bach|Johann_Sebastian_Bach|  has no key signature, leading it to be called the  Dorian , but it is still in D minor; the Bs that occur in the piece are written with  |accidentals|Accidental| .       Keys which are associated with the same key signature are called  |relative_keys|Relative_Minor/Major| .     When  |musical_modes|Musical_Mode| , such as  |Lydian|Lydian_Mode|  or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called transposed modes.               Exceptions to  |common-practice-period|Common_Practice_Period|  use may be found in  |Klezmer|Klezmer|  scales, such as  |Freygish|Phrygian_Dominant_Scale| . In the 20th century, composers such as  |Bartók|Béla_Bartók|  and  |Rzewski|Frederic_Rzewski|  began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the  |standard_order|Musical_Mode| .     Because of the limitations of the traditional  |highland_bagpipe|Great_Highland_Bagpipe|  scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, the usual   F and C.                     The above 15 key signatures only express the diatonic scale, and are therefore sometimes called standard key signatures. Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidental as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E , and F and G used for the E diminished  scale in Bartóks Crossed Hands , or the B, E and F used for the D  |Phrygian_dominant_scale|Phrygian_Dominant_Scale|  in  |Frederic_Rzewskis|Frederic_Rzewski|  God to a Hungry Child.     The absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of C major  / A minor as each accidental may be notated explicitly as required, or the piece may be  |modal|Musical_Mode|  or  |atonal|Atonality| . An example is Bartóks  |Piano_Sonata|Piano_Sonata| , which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.     If not bound by common practice conventions,  |microtones|Microtonal_Music|  can also be notated in a key signature; which  |microtonal_symbols|List_Of_Musical_Symbolsquarter_Tones|  are used depends on the system.     The  |common_practice_period|Common_Practice_Period|  conventions are so firmly established that some  |musical_notation_programs|Scorewriter|  have been unable to show nonstandard key signatures until recently.         The use of a one-flat signature developed in the  |Medieval|Medieval_Music|  period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century. Key Signature , Harvard Dictionary of Music, 2nd ed.     When signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a partial signature or conflicting signature. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century. Partial Signature , Harvard Dictionary of Music, 2nd ed. The 16th-century motet Absolon fili mi by  |Pierre_de_La_Rue|Pierre_De_La_Rue|   features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.     Baroque music written in  |minor_keys|Minor_Key|  often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats .
