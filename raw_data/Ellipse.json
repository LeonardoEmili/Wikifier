The midpoint C of the line segment joining the foci is called the center of the ellipse. The line through the foci is called the major axis, and the line perpendicular to it through the center is the minor axis. The major axis intersects the ellipse at the vertex points V1,V2 , which have distance a to the center. The distance c of the foci to the center is called the focal distance or linear eccentricity. The quotient e  is the eccentricity.     The case F1F2 yields a circle and is included as a special type of ellipse.     The equation |PF2| + |PF1 | 2a can be viewed in a different way :   : If c2 is the circle with midpoint F2 and radius 2a , then the distance of a point P to the circle c2 equals the distance to the focus F1 :   :: |PF1||Pc2|.     c2 is called the circular directrix of the ellipse.
