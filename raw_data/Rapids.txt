               Rapids are sections of a river where the river bed has a relatively steep  |gradient|Stream_Gradient| , causing an increase in water  |velocity|Velocity|  and  |turbulence|Turbulence| .     Rapids are  |hydrological|Hydrology|  features between a run  and a  cascade . Rapids are characterised by the river becoming shallower with some  |rocks|Rock|  exposed above the flow surface. As flowing water splashes over and around the rocks, air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white colour, forming what is called  |whitewater|Whitewater|  . Rapids occur where the  |bed_material|Stream_Bed|  is highly resistant to the erosive power of the stream in comparison with the bed downstream of the rapids. Very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length. Rapids cause  |water_aeration|Water_Aeration|  of the stream or river resulting in better water quality.     Rapids are categorized in  |classes|International_Scale_Of_River_Difficulty| , generally running from I to VI. A Class 5 rapid may be categorized as Class 5.1-5.9. While class I rapids are easy to navigate and require little maneuvering, class VI rapids pose threat to life with little or no chance for rescue.  |River_rafting|River_Rafting| .
