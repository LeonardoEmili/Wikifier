        Hastings  is a seaside  |town|Town|  and  |borough|Borough|  in  |East_Sussex|East_Sussex|  on the south coast of  |England|England| ,    east to the county town of  |Lewes|Lewes|  and  south east of  |London|London| . The town gives its name to the  |Battle_of_Hastings|Battle_Of_Hastings| , which took place  to the north-west at  |Senlac_Hill|Senlac_Hill|  in 1066. It later became one of the medieval  |Cinque_Ports|Cinque_Ports| . In the 19th century, it was a popular  |seaside_resort|Seaside_Resort| , as the railway allowed tourists and visitors to reach the town. Today, Hastings is a fishing port with a beach-based fishing fleet. It had an estimated population of 92,855 in 2018.                The first mention of Hastings is found in the late 8th century in the form Hastingas. This is derived from the Old English tribal name  Hæstingas , meaning the constituency of Hæsta.  |Symeon_of_Durham|Symeon_Of_Durham|  records the victory of  |Offa|Offa|  in 771 over the Hestingorum gens, that is, the people of the Hastings tribe.  |Hastingleigh|Hastingleigh|  in Kent was named after that tribe. The place name Hæstingaceaster is found in the  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  entry for 1050, Eilert Ekwall, The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, Oxford University Press, 1936. Mills, A. D. &  |Room,_Adrian|Room,_Adrian|  A Dictionary of British Place-names , in:  |Patrick_Hanks|Patrick_Hanks|  et al. The Oxford Names Companion,  |Oxford_University_Press|Oxford_University_Press| , 2002. , pp. 895-1264; p. 1061 and may be an alternative name for Hastings. However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that Hæstingaceaster may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at  |Pevensey|Pevensey| . Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity, Sussex Archaeological Collections, 133 , 213–24.      Evidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and  |Bronze_Age|Bronze_Age|  artefacts have been found.  |Iron_Age|Iron_Age|  forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the  |Romans|Ancient_Rome|  arrived in Britain for the first time in 55  BC. At this time, they began to  |exploit_the_iron|Iron_Industry_Of_Ashdown_Forest|  , and shipped it out by boat. Iron was worked locally at  |Beauport_Park|Beauport_Park| , to the north of the town. It employed up to one thousand men and is considered to have been the third-largest mine in the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| .      With the departure of the Romans, the town suffered setbacks. The Beauport site was abandoned, and the town suffered from problems from nature and man-made attacks. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of  |longshore_drift|Longshore_Drift|  , the coastline has been frequently changing. The original Roman port is likely now under the sea.       |Bulverhythe|Bulverhythe|  was probably a harbour used by Danish invaders, which suggests that -hythe or hithe means a port or small haven.        From the 6th century AD until 771, the people of the area around modern-day Hastings, identified the territory as that of the  |Haestingas|Haestingas|  tribe and a kingdom separate from the surrounding kingdoms of  |Suth_Saxe|Kingdom_Of_Sussex|  and  |Kent|Kingdom_Of_Kent| . It worked to retain its separate cultural identity until the 11th century.  The kingdom was probably a sub-kingdom, the object of a disputed overlordship by the two powerful neighbouring kingdoms: when King  |Wihtred|Wihtred|  of Kent settled a dispute with King  |Ine|Ine_Of_Wessex|  of Sussex & Wessex in 694, it is probable that he seceded the overlordship of Haestingas to Ine as part of the treaty. Kirby, Earliest English Kings, p.  124.     In 771 King  |Offa|Offa|  of Mercia invaded Southern England, and over the next decade gradually seized control of Sussex and Kent.  |Symeon_of_Durham|Symeon_Of_Durham|  records a battle fought at an unidentified location near Hastings in 771, at which Offa defeated the Haestingas  |tribe|Tribe| , effectively ending its existence as a separate kingdom. By 790, Offa controlled Hastings effectively enough to confirm grants of land in Hastings to the  |Abbey|Abbey|  of St Denis, in  |Paris|Paris| .  But, the  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle  for 1011 relates that Vikings overran all Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Haestingas , indicating the town was still considered a separate county or province to its neighbours 240 years after Offas conquest.      During the reign of  |Athelstan|Athelstan| , he established a royal  |mint|Mint|  in Hastings in AD 928.           The start of the  |Norman_Conquest|Norman_Conquest|  was the  |Battle_of_Hastings|Battle_Of_Hastings| , fought on 14 October 1066, although the battle itself took place  to the north at Senlac Hill, and William had landed on the coast between Hastings and Eastbourne at Pevensey. It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the towns outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That New Burgh was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the  |Domesday_Book|Domesday_Book|  as such.  |William|William_The_Conqueror|  defeated and killed  |Harold_Godwinson|Harold_Godwinson| , the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.     William caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.     Hastings was shown as a  |borough|Borough|  by the time of the  |Domesday_Book|Domesday_Book|  ; it had also given its name to the  |Rape_of_Hastings|Rape_Of_Hastings| , one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a  |corporation|Corporation|  consisting of a bailiff, jurats, and commonalty . By a Charter of  |Elizabeth_I|Elizabeth_I_Of_England|  in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.     Muslim scholar  |Muhammad_al-Idrisi|Muhammad_Al-Idrisi| , writing c.1153, described Hastings as a town of large extent and many inhabitants, flourishing and handsome, having markets, workpeople and rich merchants .             By the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland . It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.     In the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the  |Cinque_Ports|Cinque_Ports| ;  |Sandwich|Sandwich,_Kent| ,  |Dover|Dover|  and  |New_Romney|New_Romney|  being the first, Hastings and  |Hythe|Hythe,_Kent|  followed, all finally being joined by  |Rye|Rye,_East_Sussex|  and  |Winchelsea|Winchelsea| , at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.          In the 13th century, much of the town and half of  |Hastings_Castle|Hastings_Castle|  was washed away in the  |South_England_flood_of_February_1287|South_England_Flood_Of_February_1287| . During a  |naval_campaign_of_1339|English_Channel_Naval_Campaign,_1338-1339| , and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings days were finished.        Hastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of  |Elizabeth_I|Elizabeth_I| , but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.     Hastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.  Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are  |St_Clements_Caves|St_Clements_Caves|  , partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the  |Napoleonic_Wars|Napoleonic_Wars| , for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.        It was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent  is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new  |St_Leonards|St_Leonards-On-Sea| .     The extensive development meant that a large transient work-force was required. Many of the people coming in to Hastings at this time, settled on some waste-ground to the west of the main town called the  |America_Ground|America_Ground| . This land, originally a shingle spit created by the great storm of 1287, was declared to be Crown Property after an inquiry held at  |Battle|Battle|  during 1827 and the land was cleared in preparation for the development of this area of land by  |Patrick_Francis_Robertson|Patrick_Francis_Robertson|   .             Like many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the  |Victorian_era|Victorian_Era| . In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.     The last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the Harbour arm remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.     Between 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters. These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as  |Judges_Postcards|Judges_Postcards| .     In the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as The Old Bathing Pool .       The 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.               Hastings returned two  |Members_of_Parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one. Since 1983, it has been part of the  |parliamentary_constituency_of_Hastings_and_Rye|Hastings_And_Rye| ; the current MP, since  |2010|2010_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , is  |Amber_Rudd|Amber_Rudd|  of the Conservative Party. Prior to 1983, the town formed the  |Hastings_parliamentary_constituency|Hastings|  by itself.     Hastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the  |Domesday_Book|Domesday_Book|  refers to a new Borough |corporation|Corporation|  consisting of a bailiff, jurats, and commonalty . Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six  |Rapes|Rape|  or administrative districts of Sussex.        By a Charter of  |Elizabeth_I|Elizabeth_I_Of_England|  in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the towns importance was dwindling. In the  |Georgian_era|Georgian_Era| , patronage of such seaside places  gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a  |County_Borough|County_Borough| , responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex ; less than one hundred years later,  |in_1974|Local_Government_Act_1972| , that status was abolished.     Hastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below  |East_Sussex_County_Council|East_Sussex_County_Council| . The Labour Party has an overall control of the council with 23 seats, whilst the Conservative Party holds 9 seats and one is held by an independent. The Borough is divided into sixteen  |electoral_wards|Wards_Of_The_United_Kingdom| ; Ashdown, Baird, Braybrooke, Castle, Central  |St_Leonards|St_Leonards-On-Sea| , Conquest, Gensing,  |Hollington|Hollington,_East_Sussex| , Maze Hill,  |Old_Hastings|Hastings_Old_Town| ,  |Ore|Ore,_East_Sussex| , St Helens,  |Silverhill|Silverhill,_Hastings| , Tressell,  |West_St_Leonards|West_St_Leonards|  and Wishing Tree.  The council leader is Peter Chowney, who stood against Rudd as a Labour candidate in the  |2017_election|2017_United_Kingdom_General_Election| .              Hastings is situated where the  |sandstone|Sandstone|  beds, at the heart of the  |Weald|Weald| , known geologically as the Hastings Sands, meet the  |English_Channel|English_Channel| , forming tall cliffs to the east of the town.  |Hastings_Old_Town|Hastings_Old_Town|  is in a sheltered valley between the East Hill and West Hill . In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of  |St_Leonards-on-Sea|St_Leonards-On-Sea|  to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of  |Ore|Ore,_Sussex| , from which The Ridge , marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards  |Battle|Battle,_East_Sussex| . Beyond  |Bulverhythe|Bulverhythe| , the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as  |Glyne_Gap|Glyne_Gap| , separating it from  |Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill-On-Sea| .     The sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of  |Fairlight|Fairlight,_East_Sussex| .     The beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide. The town is generally built upon a series of low hills rising to   |above_sea_level|Above_Mean_Sea_Level|  at The Ridge before falling back in the river valley further to the north.        There are three  |Sites_of_Special_Scientific_Interest|Sites_Of_Special_Scientific_Interest|  within the borough;  |Marline_Valley_Woods|Marline_Valley_Woods| ,  |Combe_Haven|Combe_Haven|  and  |Hastings_Cliffs_To_Pett_Beach|Hastings_Country_Park| . Marline Valley Woods lies within the Ashdown ward of Hastings. It is an  |ancient_woodland|Ancient_Woodland|  of  |Pedunculate_oak|Quercus_Robur| — |hornbeam|Carpinus_Betulus|  which is uncommon nationally. Sussex Wildlife Trust own part of the site.  Combe Haven is another site of biological interest, with alluvial meadows, and the largest reed bed in the county, providing habitat for breeding birds. It is in the West St Leonards ward, stretching into the parish of  |Crowhurst|Crowhurst,_East_Sussex| .  The final SSSI, Hastings Cliffs to Pett Beach, is within the Ore ward of Hastings, extending into the neighbouring Fairlight and  |Pett|Pett|  parishes. The site runs along the coast and is of both biological and geological interest. The cliffs hold many fossils and the site has many habitats, including ancient woodland and shingle beaches.          As with the rest of the  |British_Isles|British_Isles|  and Southern England, Hastings experiences a  |maritime_climate|Maritime_Climate|  with cool summers and mild winters. In terms of the local climate, Hastings is on the eastern edge of what is, on average, the sunniest part of the UK, the stretch of coast from the Isle of Wight to the Hastings area. Hastings, tied with Eastbourne, recorded the highest duration of sunshine of any month anywhere in the United Kingdom – 384 hours – in 1911.  Temperature extremes since 1960 at Hastings have ranged from  in July 2019,  down to  in January 1987.  The  |Köppen_Climate_Classification|Köppen_Climate_Classification|  subtype for this climate is  |Cfb|Köppen_Climate_Classificationgroup_C:_Mild_Temperate/Mesothermal_Climates|  .             Some of the areas and suburbs of Hastings are  |Ore_Valley|Ore_Valley| ,  |St_Leonards|St_Leonards_On_Sea| ,  |Silverhill|Silverhill,_East_Sussex| ,  |West_St_Leonards|Bulverhythe| , and  |Hollington|Hollington,_East_Sussex| . Ore, Silverhill and Hollington were once villages that have since become part of the Hastings conurbation area during rapid growth. The original part St Leonards was bought by  |James_Burton|James_Burton|  and laid out by his son, the architect  |Decimus_Burton|Decimus_Burton| , in the early 19th century as a new town: a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off; it also included a central public garden, a hotel, an archery,  |assembly_rooms|Assembly_Rooms|  and  |a_church|St_Leonards_Church,_St_Leonards-On-Sea| . Todays St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design, although the original town still exists within it.        The population of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the  |High_Weald_Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty|High_Weald_Area_Of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty|  to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and  |Rother|Rother_District|  district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades.  This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.           Ethnicity in 2001            Until the development of tourism,  |fishing|Fishing|  was Hastings major industry. The fishing fleet, based at  |the_Stade|The_Stade| , remains Europes largest beach-launched fishing fleet and has recently won accreditation for its sustainable methods. The fleet has been based on the same beach, below the cliffs at Hastings, for at least 400, possibly 600, years. Its longevity is attributed to the prolific fishing ground of Rye Bay nearby.  Hastings fishing vessels are registered at  |Rye|Rye,_East_Sussex| , and thus bear the letters RX .     There are now various industrial estates that lie around the town, mostly on the outskirts, which include engineering, catering, motoring and construction; however, most of the jobs within the Borough are concentrated on health, public services, retail and education. 85% of the firms employed fewer than 10 people; as a consequence the unemployment rate was 3.3% . However, qualification levels are similar to the national average: 8.2% of the working-age population have no qualifications while 28% hold degree-level qualifications or higher, compared with 11% and 31% respectively across England.          Hastings main shopping centre is  |Priory_Meadow_Shopping_Centre|Priory_Meadow_Shopping_Centre| , which was built on the site of the old  |Central_Recreation_Ground|Central_Recreation_Ground|  which played host to some  |Sussex_CCC|Sussex_County_Cricket_Club| |first-class|First-Class_Cricket|  fixtures, and cricketing royalty such as Dr.  |W._G._Grace|W._G._Grace|  and Sir  |Don_Bradman|Don_Bradman| . The centre houses 56 stores and covers around 420,000  ft 2 . Further retail areas in the town centre include Queens Road, Wellington Place and Robertson Street.        There are plans to expand the retail area in Hastings, which includes expanding Priory Meadow and creating more retail space as part of the Priory Quarter development. Priory was intended to have a second floor added to part of the retail area, which has not happened yet and so far only office space has been created as part of the Priory Quarter.        In 2002 the Hastings and Bexhill task force, set up by the  |South_East_England_Development_Agency|South_East_England_Development_Agency| , was founded to regenerate the local economy, a 10-year programme being set up to tackle the local reliance on public sector employment. The regeneration scheme saw the construction of the  |University_Centre_Hastings|University_Centre_Hastings| ,  the new  |Sussex_Coast_College|Sussex_Coast_College|  campus and construction of the Priory Quarter, which still remains unfinished but now houses  |Saga|Saga_Group|  offices, bringing 800 new jobs to the area.   SEEDA   Sea Space           Hastings has an  |Army_Cadet_Force|Army_Cadet_Force| |detachment|Detachment|  which is part of  |Sussex_ACF|List_Of_Acf_Unitssouth_East_England| . This detachment is based in the old Territorial Army Unit Building on Cinque Ports Way, and is affiliated to  |PWRR|Princess_Of_Wales_Royal_Regiment| .  Hastings also has a  |Royal_Air_Force_Air_Cadet|Royal_Air_Force_Air_Cadets|  Squadron, 304 Squadron of Sussex Wing RAFAC, based in the same building.  The town also has a  |Sea_Cadet|Sea_Cadets|  squadron, T.S. Hastings. This sits adjacent to the Army and Air Cadet building on the seafront. The site features a climbing wall and other training facilities.              Throughout the year many annual events take place in Hastings, the largest of which being the  |May_Day|May_Day| |bank_holiday|Bank_Holiday|  weekend, which features a  |Jack-in-the-Green|Jack-In-The-Green|  festival ,  and the culmination of the  |Maydayrun|Maydayrun| —tens of thousands of motorcyclists having ridden the  |A21|A21_Road|  to Hastings. The yearly carnival during  |Old_Town_Week|Hastings_Old_Town_Week|  takes place every August, which includes a week of events around  |Hastings_Old_Town|Hastings_Old_Town| , including a Seaboot race, bike race, street party and pram race. In September, there is a month-long arts festival Coastal Currents and a Seafood and Wine Festival. During  held each year around 14 October the Hastings Bonfire Society  stages a traditional Sussex Bonfire which includes a torchlight procession through the streets, a beach bonfire and firework display.   Hastings Pirate Day takes place in July every year. Hastings, as of November 2017, still holds the Guinness World Record for the most pirates in one place.     Other smaller events include the  |Hastings_Beer_and_Music_Festival|Hastings_Beer_And_Music_Festival| , held every July in  |Alexandra_Park|Alexandra_Park,_Hastings| , the  |Hastings_Musical_Festival|Hastings_Musical_Festival|  held every March in the  |White_Rock_Theatre|White_Rock_Theatre|  and the  |Hastings_International_Chess_Congress|Hastings_International_Chess_Congress| .       There are two main theatres in the town, the  |White_Rock_Theatre|White_Rock_Theatre|  and the Stables Theatre. The White Rock theatre is the venue of the yearly pantomime and throughout the year hosts comedy, dance and music acts. The Stables stages more local productions and acts as an arts exhibition centre. The Phoenix Arts Centre, based at  |Ark_William_Parker_Academy|Ark_William_Parker_Academy|  also stages local productions as well as shows put on by the school. An additional theatre is located in Cambridge Road, the  in a shared space with the His Place church in what used to be the  |Robertson_Street_Congregational_Church|Robertson_Street_Congregational_Church| .     There is a small four screen  |Odeon|Odeon_Cinemas|  cinema in the town, located opposite the town hall; however, there are plans to build a new multiplex cinema as part of the Priory Quarter development in the town centre. The town has an independent cinema called the  located in the Old Town and a restored cinema in St Leonards called the           There are three museums in Hastings; the  |Hastings_Museum_and_Art_Gallery|Hastings_Museum_And_Art_Gallery| , the  |Hastings_Fishermens_Museum|Hastings_Fishermens_Museum|  and the Shipwreck Museum. The former two mentioned are open for the whole year while the Shipwreck Museum is open only weekends during the winter, but daily for the rest of the year.     The Hastings Museum and Art gallery concentrates mostly on local history and contains exhibits on  |Grey_Owl|Grey_Owl|  and  |John_Logie_Baird|John_Logie_Baird| . It also features a  |Durbar_Hall|Durbar_Hall| , donated by  |Lord_Brassey|Thomas_Brassey,_2Nd_Earl_Brassey| ; the hall contains displays focusing on the Indian subcontinent and the Brassey Family. The Fishermens Museum, housed in the former fishermens church, is dedicated to the fishing industry and maritime history of Hastings. The  |Shipwreck_Museum|Shipwreck_Museum|  displays artifacts from wrecks around the area.     The  |Jerwood_Gallery|Jerwood_Gallery|  located in the Stade area of  |Hastings_Old_Town|Hastings_Old_Town|  is the home for the Jerwood Collection of 20th and 21st century art and a changing contemporary exhibition programme.  The project was opposed by many locals who felt that a new art gallery would have been better located elsewhere in the town.      Jerwood Gallery has now been replaced with the  |Hastings_Contemporary|Hastings_Contemporary| .       There are many parks and open spaces located throughout the town, one of the most popular and largest being  |Alexandra_Park|Alexandra_Park,_Hastings|  opened in 1882 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The park contains gardens, open spaces, woods, a bandstand, tennis courts and a cafe. Other open spaces include White Rock Gardens, West Marina Gardens, St Leonards Gardens, Gensing Gardens, Markwick Gardens, Summerfields Woods, Linton Gardens, Hollington woods, Filsham Valley, Warrior Square, Castle Hill, St Helens Woods and  |Hastings_Country_Park|Hastings_Country_Park| .           |Hastings_Castle|Hastings_Castle|  was built in 1070 by the  |Normans|Normans| , four years after the  |Norman_invasion|Norman_Conquest_Of_England| . It is located on the West Hill, overlooking the town centre and is a Grade I  |listed_building|Listed_Building| . Little remains of the castle apart from the arch left from the chapel, part of the walls and dungeons. The nearby  |St._Clements_Caves|St._Clements_Caves|  are home to the Smugglers Adventure, which features interactive displays relating to the history of smuggling on the south coast of England.      |Hastings_Pier|Hastings_Pier|  can be seen from any part of the seafront in the town. The old pier was opened in 1872, but closed in 2006 following safety concerns from the council. In October 2010, a serious fire burned down most of the buildings on the pier and caused further damage to the structure.  However, the pier reopened on 27 April 2016 in modern architectural forms after a £14.2m refurbishment.  It won the Stirling Prize of the  |Royal_Institute_of_British_Architects|Royal_Institute_Of_British_Architects|  in 2017.         Many church buildings throughout the town are Grade II listed including;  |Church_in_the_Wood|Church_In_The_Wood,_Hollington| , Blacklands Parish Church, Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel,  |Fishermens_Museum|Hastings_Fishermens_Museum|  and  |St_Mary_Magdalenes_Church|St_Mary_Magdalenes_Church,_St_Leonards-On-Sea| .     On the seafront at St Leonards is Marine Court, a 1938 block of flats in the  |Art_Deco|Art_Deco|  style that was originally called The Ship due to its style being based on the ocean liner  |RMS_Queen_Mary|Rms_Queen_Mary| . This block of flats can be seen up to  away on a clear day, from Holywell, in the Meads area of  |Eastbourne|Eastbourne| .     An important former landmark was the Memorial , a clock tower commemorating Albert the  |Prince_Consort|Prince_Consort|  which stood for many years at the traffic junction at the town centre, but was demolished following an arson attack in the 1970s.           There are two major roads in Hastings: the  |A21|A21_Road|  trunk road to London; and the  |A259|A259_Road|  coastal road. Both are beset with traffic problems: although the London road, which has to contend with difficult terrain, has had several sections of widening over the past decades there are still many delays. Long-term plans for a much improved A259 east–west route were abandoned in the 1990s. A new Hastings-Bexhill Link Road opened in April 2016 known as the  |A2690|A2690|  with the hope of reducing traffic congestion along the A259 Bexhill Road. The new link road travels from Queensway in the North of Hastings and joins up to the A259 in Bexhill.  Hastings is also linked to  |Battle|Battle,_East_Sussex|  via the  |A2100|A2100_Road| , the original London road.     The town is served by  |Stagecoach_in_Hastings|Stagecoach_In_Hastings|  buses on routes that serve the town, and also extend to Bexhill, Eastbourne and Dover as part of  |The_Wave_route|Stagecoach_The_Wave_Routes| . Stagecoach also run long distance buses up to  |Northiam|Northiam| ,  |Hawkhurst|Hawkhurst| ,  |Royal_Tunbridge_Wells|Royal_Tunbridge_Wells| ,  |Ashford|Ashford,_Kent|  and  |Canterbury|Canterbury| .      |National_Express_Coaches|National_Express_Coaches|  run service 023 to London.          Hastings has four  |rail|Railway|  links: two to London, one to  |Brighton|Brighton|  and one to  |Ashford|Ashford,_Kent| . Of the London lines, the shorter is the  |Hastings_Line|Hastings_Line| , the former  |South_Eastern_Railway|South_Eastern_Railway|  route to  |Charing_Cross|Charing_Cross_Railway_Station|  via  |Battle|Battle,_East_Sussex|  and  |Tunbridge_Wells|Royal_Tunbridge_Wells| , which opened in 1852; and the longer is the  |East_Coastway_Line|East_Coastway_Line| , the former  |London,_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway|London,_Brighton_And_South_Coast_Railway|  route to  |Victoria|Victoria_Station|  via  |Bexhill|Bexhill-On-Sea| ,  |Eastbourne|Eastbourne|  and  |Lewes|Lewes| . Trains to Brighton also use the East Coastway Line. The  |Marshlink_Line|Marshlink_Line|  runs via  |Rye|Rye,_East_Sussex|  to Ashford where a connection can be made with  |Eurostar|Eurostar|  services, and is unelectrified except for the Hastings-Ore segment.     A historic  |British_Rail_Class_201|British_Rail_Class_201|  Thumper can sometimes been seen on historic runs to and from Hastings.      Hastings is served by two rail companies:  |Southeastern|Southeastern|  and  |Southern|Southern| .   Southeastern services run along the Hastings Line, generally terminating at Hastings, with some peak services extending to Ore; the other lines are served by Southern, with services terminating at Ore or Ashford.     The town currently has four railway stations: from west to east they are  |West_St_Leonards_station|West_St_Leonards_Station| ,  |St_Leonards_Warrior_Square|St_Leonards_Warrior_Square| ,  |Hastings|Hastings_Railway_Station| , and  |Ore|Ore_Railway_Station| ; this latter has been proposed to be renamed to Ore Valley. There is also one closed station and one proposed station in the area.  |West_Marina|West_Marina_Railway_Station|  station was very near West St Leonards and was closed some years ago. A new station has been proposed at Glyne Gap in Bexhill, which would also serve residents from western Hastings.           There are two  |funicular_railways|Funicular_Railway| , known locally as the  |West_Hill|West_Hill_Cliff_Railway|  and  |East_Hill_Lifts|East_Hill_Cliff_Railway|  respectively.     The  |Hastings_Miniature_Railway|Hastings_Miniature_Railway|  operates along the beach from  |Rock-a-Nore|Rock-A-Nore|  to Marine Parade, and has provided tourist transport since 1948. The railway was considerably restored and re-opened in 2010.     A local metro railway service from  |Bexhill|Bexhill_Railway_Station|  to  |Ore|Ore_Railway_Station|  has also been proposed.
