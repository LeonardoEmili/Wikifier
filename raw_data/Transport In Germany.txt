         As a densely populated country in a central location in  |Europe|Europe|  and with a developed  |economy|Economy_Of_Germany| ,  |Germany|Germany|  has a dense and modern  |transport|Transport| |infrastructure|Infrastructure| .     The first highway system to have been built, the extensive German  |Autobahn|German_Autobahnen|  network famously has no general speed limit for light vehicles . The countrys most important waterway is the river  |Rhine|Rhine| . The largest port is that of  |Hamburg|Hamburg| .  |Frankfurt_Airport|Frankfurt_Airport|  is a major international airport and European transport hub.  |Air_travel|Air_Travel|  is used for greater distances within Germany but faces competition from the state-owned  |Deutsche_Bahns|Deutsche_Bahn|  rail network. High-speed trains called  |ICE|Intercity-Express|  connect cities for passenger travel with speeds up to 300  km/h. Many German cities have  |rapid_transit|Rapid_Transit_In_Germany|  systems and  |public_transport|Public_Transport|  is available in most areas. Buses have historically only played a marginal role in long distance passenger service, as all routes directly competing with rail services were technically outlawed by a law dating to 1935. Only in 2012 was this law officially amended and thus; a long distance bus market has also emerged in Germany since then.     Since  |German_reunification|German_Reunification|  substantial effort has been made to improve and expand transport infrastructure in what was formerly  |East_Germany|East_Germany| .  - The federal government says 40% of €164,000,000,000 spent on transport infrastructure where spent in the eastern part     Verkehrsmittel and Verkehrszeichen -  |Transportation_Signs_in_Germany|Road_Signs_In_Germany|  are available here in German and English.              The volume of traffic in Germany, especially goods transportation, is at a very high level due to its central location in Europe.   In the past few decades, much of the freight traffic shifted from rail to road, which led the  |Federal_Government|German_Government|  to introduce a motor toll for trucks in 2005. Individual road usage increased resulting in a relatively high traffic density to other nations. A further increase of traffic is expected in the future.     High-speed vehicular traffic has a long tradition in Germany given that the first  |freeway|Freeway|   in the world, the  |AVUS|Avus| , and the worlds first  |automobile|Automobile|  were developed and built in Germany. Germany possesses one of the most dense road systems of the world. German motorways have no blanket  |speed_limit|Speed_Limit|  for light vehicles. However, posted limits are in place on many dangerous or congested stretches as well as where traffic noise or pollution poses a problem .     The German government has had issues with upkeep of the countrys autobahn network, having had to revamp the Eastern portions transport system since the unification of Germany between the  |German_Democratic_Republic|German_Democratic_Republic|  and the  |Federal_Republic_of_Germany|West_Germany|  . With that, numerous construction projects have been put on hold in the west, and a vigorous reconstruction has been going on for almost 20 years. However, ever since the  |European_Union|European_Union|  formed, an overall streamlining and change of route plans have occurred as faster and more direct links to former  |Soviet_bloc|Soviet_Bloc|  countries now exist and are in the works, with intense co-operation among European countries.      |Intercity_bus_service|Intercity_Bus_Service|  within Germany fell out of favour as  |post-war_prosperity_increased|Wirtschaftswunder| , and became almost extinct when legislation was introduced in the 1980s to protect the national railway. After that market was deregulated in 2012, some 150 new intercity bus lines have been established, leading to a significant shift from rail to bus for long journeys.  The market has since consolidated with  |Flixbus|Flixbus|  controlling over 90% of it and also expanding into neighboring countries.                  Germany has approximately 650,000  km of roads,  of which 231,000  km are non-local roads.  The road network is extensively used with nearly 2 trillion km travelled by car in 2005, in comparison to just 70 billion km travelled by rail and 35 billion km travelled by plane.     The  Autobahn  is the German federal highway system. The official German term is  , which translates as federal motorway. Where no local speed limit is posted, the advisory limit  is 130  km/h. The Autobahn network had a total length of about  in 2016,  which ranks it among the most dense and longest systems in the world. Only federally built  |controlled-access_highways|Controlled-Access_Highway|  meeting certain construction standards including at least two lanes per direction are called  Bundesautobahn . They have their own, blue-coloured signs and their own numbering system. All Autobahnen are named by using the capital letter A, followed by a blank and a number .     The main Autobahnen going all across Germany have single digit numbers. Shorter highways of regional importance have double digit numbers . Very short stretches built for heavy local traffic  usually have three digits, where the first digit depends on the region.     East-west routes are usually even-numbered, north-south routes are usually odd-numbered. The numbers of the north-south Autobahnen increase from west to east; that is to say, the more easterly roads are given higher numbers. Similarly, the east-west routes use increasing numbers from north to south.     The autobahns are considered the safest category of German roads: for example, in 2012, while carrying 31% of all motorized road traffic, they only accounted for 11% of Germanys traffic fatalities.       German autobahns are still toll-free for light vehicles, but on 1 January 2005, a blanket  |mandatory_toll_on_heavy_trucks|Lkw-Maut|  was introduced.     The national roads in Germany are called  Bundesstraße n . Their numbers are usually well known to local road users, as they appear on direction traffic signs and on street maps. A Bundesstraße is often referred to as B followed by its number, for example  |B1|Bundesstraße_1| , one of the main east-west routes. More important routes have lower numbers. Odd numbers are usually applied to north-south oriented roads, and even numbers for east-west routes. Bypass routes are referred to with an appended a or n , as in B  56n .     Other main public roads are maintained by the  Bundesländer  , called  Landesstraße  or Staatsstraße . The numbers of these roads are prefixed with L , S or St , but are usually not seen on direction signs or written on maps. They appear on the kilometre posts on the roadside. Numbers are unique only within one state.     The  Landkreis e and municipalities are in charge of the minor roads and streets within villages, towns and cities. These roads have the number prefix K indicating a  Kreisstraße .                 Germany features a total of 43,468  km railways, of which at least 19,973  km are electrified .       |Deutsche_Bahn|Deutsche_Bahn_Ag|  is the major German railway infrastructure and service operator. Though Deutsche Bahn is a private company, the government still holds all shares and therefore Deutsche Bahn can still be called a state-owned company. Since its reformation under private law in 1994, Deutsche Bahn AG no longer publishes details of the tracks it owns; in addition to the DBAG system there are about 280 privately or locally owned railway companies which own an approximate 3,000  km to 4,000  km of the total tracks and use DB tracks in open access.     Railway subsidies amounted to €17.0 billion in 2014  and there are significant differences between the financing of long-distance and short-distance trains in Germany. While long-distance trains can be run by any railway company, the companies also receive no subsidies from the government. Local trains however are subsidised by the German states, which pay the operating companies to run these trains and indeed in 2013, 59% of the cost of short-distance passenger rail transport was covered by subsidies.  This resulted in many private companies offering to run local train services as they can provide cheaper service than the state-owned Deutsche Bahn. Track construction is entirely and track maintenance partly government financed both for long and short range trains. On the other hand, all rail vehicles are charged track access charges by  |DB_Netz|Db_Netz|  which in turn delivers its profits to the federal budget.     High speed rail started in the early 1990s with the introduction of the Inter City Express into revenue service after first plans to modernize the rail system had been drawn up under the government of  |Willy_Brandt|Willy_Brandt| . While the high speed network is not as dense as those of France or Spain, ICE or slightly slower Intercity serve most major cities. Several extensions or upgrades to high speed lines are under construction or planned for the near future, some of them after decades of planning.     The fastest high-speed train operated by Deutsche Bahn, the  |InterCityExpress|Intercityexpress|  or ICE connects major German and neighbouring international centres such as  |Zurich|Zurich| ,  |Vienna|Vienna| ,  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen| ,  |Paris|Paris| ,  |Amsterdam|Amsterdam|  and  |Brussels|Brussels| . The rail network throughout Germany is extensive and provides excellent service in most areas. On regular lines, at least one train every two hours will call even in the smallest of villages during the day. Nearly all larger metropolitan areas are served by  |S-Bahn|S-Bahn| ,  |U-Bahn|Rapid_Transit_In_Germanyu-Bahn| ,  |Straßenbahn|Trams_In_Germany|  and/or bus networks.     The German government on 13 February 2018 announced plans to make public transportation free as a means to reduce road traffic and decrease air pollution to EU-mandated levels.  The new policy will be put to the test by the end of the year in the cities of  |Bonn|Bonn| ,  |Essen|Essen| ,  |Herrenberg|Herrenberg| ,  |Reutlingen|Reutlingen|  and  |Mannheim|Mannheim| .  Issues remain concerning the costs of such a move as ticket sales for public transportation constitute a major source of income for cities.        While Germany and most of  |contiguous|Geographic_Contiguity|  Europe use , differences in signalling, rules and regulations, electrification voltages, etc. create obstacles for freight operations across borders. These obstacles are slowly being overcome, with international and transit traffic being responsible for a large part of the recent uptake in rail freight volume. EU regulations have done much to harmonize standards, making cross border operations easier.  |Maschen_Marshalling_Yard|Maschen_Marshalling_Yard|  near Hamburg is the second biggest in the world and the biggest in Europe. It serves as a freight hub distributing goods from Scandinavia to southern Europe and from Central Europe to the port of Hamburg and overseas.       Almost all major metro areas of Germany have suburban rail systems called  |S-Bahn|S-Bahn| en . These usually connect larger agglomerations to their suburbs and often other regional towns, although the  |Rhein-Ruhr_S-Bahn|Rhein-Ruhr_S-Bahn|  connects several large cities. A S-Bahn doesnt skip stations and runs more frequently than other trains. In  |Berlin|Berlin|  and  |Hamburg|Hamburg|  the S-Bahn has a  |U-Bahn|U-Bahn| -like service and uses a  |third_rail|Third_Rail|  whereas all other S-Bahn services rely on regular catenary power supply.          Relatively few cities have a full-fledged underground  |U-Bahn|Rapid_Transit_In_Germanyu-Bahn|  system;  |S-Bahn|S-Bahn|   systems are far more common. In some cities the distinction between U-Bahn and S-Bahn systems is blurred, for instance some S-Bahn systems run underground, have frequencies similar to U-Bahn, and form part of the same integrated transport network. A larger number of cities has upgraded their tramways to light rail standards. These systems are called  |Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn|  , on main line rails.     Cities with  |U-Bahn|Rapid_Transit_In_Germanyu-Bahn|  systems are:    |Berlin|Berlin| |Hamburg|Hamburg| |Munich|Munich| |Nuremberg|Nuremberg| / |Fürth|Fürth|        With the exception of Hamburg, all of those aforementioned cities also have a tram system, often with new lines built to light rail standards.     Cities with Stadtbahn systems can be found in the article  |Trams_in_Germany|Trams_In_Germany| .          Germany was among the first countries to have electric street - running railways and Berlin has one of the longest tram networks in the world. Many West German cities abandoned their previous tram systems in the 1960s and 1970s while others upgraded them to  |Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn|  standard, often including underground sections. In the East, most cities retained or even expanded their tram systems and since reunification a trend towards new tram construction can be observed in most of the country. Today the only major German city without a tram or light rail system is Hamburg.  |Tram-train|Tram-Train|  systems like the  |Karlsruhe_model|Karlsruhe_Model|  first came to prominence in Germany in the early 1990s and are implemented or discussed in several cities, providing coverage far into the rural areas surrounding cities.       Short distances and the extensive network of motorways and railways make airplanes uncompetitive for travel within Germany. Only about 1% of all distance travelled was by plane in 2002. But due to a decline in prices with the introduction of low-fares airlines, domestic air travel is becoming more attractive. In 2013 Germany had the fifth largest passenger air market in the world with 105,016,346 passengers. World Bank Datebase,  However, the advent of new faster rail lines often leads to cuts in service by the airlines or even total abandonment of routes like Frankfurt-Cologne, Berlin-Hannover or Berlin-Hamburg.       :see: List of airlines of Germany       Germanys largest airline is  |Lufthansa|Lufthansa| , which was privatised in the 1990s. Lufthansa also operates two regional subsidiaries under the  |Lufthansa_Regional|Lufthansa_Regional|  brand and a low-cost subsidiary,  |Eurowings|Eurowings| , which operates independently. Lufthansa flies a dense network of domestic, European and intercontinental routes. Germanys second largest airline was  |Air_Berlin|Air_Berlin| , which also operated a network of domestic and European destinations with a focus on leisure routes as well as some long-haul services. Air Berlin declared bankruptcy in 2017 with the last flight under its own name in October of that year.     Charter and leisure carriers include  |Condor|Condor_Flugdienst| ,  |TUIfly|Tuifly| ,  |SunExpress_Deutschland|Sunexpress_Deutschland| ,  |MHS_Aviation|Mhs_Aviation|  and  |Germania|Germania| . Major German cargo operators are  |Lufthansa_Cargo|Lufthansa_Cargo| ,  |European_Air_Transport_Leipzig|European_Air_Transport_Leipzig|   and  |AeroLogic|Aerologic|  .       :see: List of airports in Germany        |Frankfurt_Airport|Frankfurt_Airport|  is Germanys largest airport, a major transportation hub in Europe and the  |worlds_twelfth_busiest_airport|List_Of_Busiest_Airports_By_Passenger_Traffic| . It is one of the airports with the largest number of international destinations served worldwide. Depending on whether total passengers, flights or cargo traffic are used as a measure, it ranks first, second or third in Europe alongside  |London_Heathrow_Airport|London_Heathrow_Airport|  and  |Paris-Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport|Paris-Charles_De_Gaulle_Airport| . Germanys second biggest international airport is  |Munich_Airport|Munich_Airport|  followed by  |Düsseldorf_Airport|Düsseldorf_Airport| .     There are several more scheduled passenger airports throughout Germany, mainly serving European metropolitan and leisure destinations. Intercontinental long-haul routes are operated to and from the airports in Frankfurt, Munich, Düsseldorf, Berlin-Tegel, Cologne/Bonn, Hamburg and Stuttgart.      |Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport|Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport|  is expected to become the third largest German airport by annual passengers once it opens, serving as single airport for Berlin. Originally planned to be completed in 2011, the new airport has been delayed several times due to poor construction management and technical difficulties.  As of September 2014, it is not yet known when the new airport will become operational.  In 2017 it was announced that the airport wouldnt open before 2019. In the same year a non-binding referendum to keep  |Tegel_Airport|Tegel_Airport|  open even after the new airport opens was passed by Berlin voters.
