|_Germany|Germany|  is a  |democratic|Democracy| ,  |federal|Federation| |_parliamentary|Parliamentary_System| |_republic|Republic| , where federal  |legislative_power|Legislative_Power|  is vested in the  |Bundestag|Bundestag|  and the  |Bundesrat|Bundesrat_Of_Germany|  .     The multilateral system has, since 1949, been dominated by the  |Christian_Democratic_Union|Christian_Democratic_Union_Of_Germany|  and the  |Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  . The  |judiciary_of_Germany|Judiciary_Of_Germany|  is independent of the  |executive|Executive|  and the  |legislature|Legislature| , while it is common for leading members of the executive to be members of the legislature as well. The political system is laid out in the 1949 constitution, the  Grundgesetz  , which remained in effect with minor amendments after  |German_reunification|German_Reunification|  in 1990.     The constitution emphasizes the protection of  |individual_liberty|Individual_Liberty|  in an extensive catalogue of  |human|Human_Rights_In_Germany|  and  |civil_rights|Civil_Rights|  and divides powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.     West Germany was a founding member of the  |European_Community|European_Communities|  in 1958, which became the  |EU|European_Union|  in 1993. It is part of the  |Schengen_Area|Schengen_Area| , and has been a member of the  |eurozone|Eurozone|  since 1999. It is a member of the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| ,  |NATO|Nato| , the  |G7|G7| , the  |G20|G_20_Major_Economies|  and the  |OECD|Organisation_For_Economic_Co_Operation_And_Development| .                After 1949, the  |Federal_Republic_of_Germany|West_Germany|  had  |Christian_Democratic|Cdu_Csu|  chancellors for 20 years until a coalition between the  |Social_Democrats|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  and the  |Liberals|Free_Democratic_Party|  took over. From 1982, Christian Democratic leader  |Helmut_Kohl|Helmut_Kohl|  was chancellor in a coalition with the Liberals for 16 years. In this period fell the reunification of Germany, in 1990: the  |German_Democratic_Republic|German_Democratic_Republic|  joined the Federal Republic. In the former GDRs territory, five Länder were established or reestablished. The two parts of Berlin united as one Land .     The political system of the Federal Republic remained more or less unchanged. Specific provisions for the former GDR territory were enabled via the unification treaty between the Federal Republic and the GDR prior to the  |unification_day|German_Unity_Day|  of 3 October 1990. However, Germany saw in the following two distinct party systems: the Green party and the Liberals remained mostly West German parties, while in the East the former socialist state party, now called PDS, flourished along with the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.               After 16 years of the Christian–Liberal coalition, led by  |Helmut_Kohl|Helmut_Kohl| , the  |Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  together with the Greens won the Bundestag elections of 1998. SPD vice chairman  |Gerhard_Schröder|Gerhard_Schröder|  positioned himself as a centrist candidate, in contradiction to the leftist SPD chairman  |Oskar_Lafontaine|Oskar_Lafontaine| . The Kohl government was hurt at the polls by slower economic growth in the East in the previous two years, and constantly high unemployment. The final margin of victory was sufficiently high to permit a red-green coalition of the SPD with  |Alliance_90_The_Greens|Alliance_90_The_Greens|  , bringing the Greens into a national government for the first time.     Initial problems of the new government, marked by policy disputes between the moderate and traditional left wings of the SPD, resulted in some voter disaffection. Lafontaine left the government in early 1999. The CDU won in some important state elections but was hit in 2000 by a party donation scandal from the Kohl years. As a result of this  |Christian_Democratic_Union|Christian_Democratic_Union|  crisis,  |Angela_Merkel|Angela_Merkel|  became chair.     The  |next_election_for_the_Bundestag|2002_German_Federal_Election|  was on 22 September 2002. Gerhard Schröder led the coalition of SPD and Greens to an eleven-seat victory over the Christian Democrat challengers headed by  |Edmund_Stoiber|Edmund_Stoiber|  . Three factors are generally cited that enabled Schröder to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before and a weaker economy: good handling of the  |100_year_flood|2002_European_Floods| , firm opposition to the US  |2003_invasion_of_Iraq|2003_Invasion_Of_Iraq| , and Stoibers unpopularity in the east, which cost the CDU crucial seats there.     In its second term, the red–green coalition lost several very important state elections, for example in  |Lower_Saxony|Lower_Saxony|  where Schröder was the prime minister from 1990 to 1998. On 20 April 2003, chancellor Schröder announced massive labor market reforms, called  |Agenda_2010|Agenda_2010| , that cut unemployment benefits. Although these reforms sparked massive protests, they are now credited with being in part responsible for the relatively strong economic performance of Germany during the  |euro_crisis|European_Debt_Crisis|  and the decrease in unemployment in Germany in the years 2006-2007.                On 22 May 2005 the SPD received a devastating defeat in its former heartland,  |North_Rhine_Westphalia|North_Rhine_Westphalia| . Half an hour after the election results, the SPD chairman  |Franz_Müntefering|Franz_Müntefering|  announced that the chancellor would clear the way for new federal elections.     This took the republic by surprise, especially because the SPD was below 20% in polls at the time. The CDU quickly announced  |Angela_Merkel|Angela_Merkel|  as Christian Democrat candidate for chancellor, aspiring to be the first female chancellor in German history.     New for the 2005 election was the alliance between the newly formed  |Electoral_Alternative_for_Labor_and_Social_Justice|Electoral_Alternative_For_Labor_And_Social_Justice|  and the PDS, planning to fuse into a common party . With the former SPD chairman, Oskar Lafontaine for the WASG and  |Gregor_Gysi|Gregor_Gysi|  for the PDS as prominent figures, this alliance soon found interest in the media and in the population. Polls in July saw them as high as 12%.     Whereas in May and June 2005 victory of the Christian Democrats seemed highly likely, with some polls giving them an absolute majority, this picture changed shortly before the election on 18 September 2005.          The election results of 18 September were surprising because they differed widely from the polls of the previous weeks. The Christian Democrats even lost votes compared to 2002, narrowly reaching the first place with only 35.2%, and failed to get a majority for a black–yellow government of  |CDU_CSU|Cdu_Csu|  and liberal FDP. But the red–green coalition also failed to get a majority, with the SPD losing votes, but polling 34.2% and the greens staying at 8.1%.  |The_Left|The_Left|  reached 8.7% and entered the  Bundestag , whereas the far-right  |NPD|National_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  only got 1.6%.       The most likely outcome of coalition talks was a so-called grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats . Three party coalitions and coalitions involving The Left had been ruled out by all interested parties . On 22 November 2005, Angela Merkel was sworn in by president  |Horst_Köhler|Horst_Köhler|  for the office of Bundeskanzlerin.     The existence of the grand coalition on federal level helped smaller parties electoral prospects in state elections. Since in 2008, the CSU lost its absolute majority in Bavaria and formed a coalition with the FDP, the grand coalition had no majority in the Bundesrat and depended on FDP votes on important issues. In November 2008, the SPD re-elected its already retired chair  |Franz_Müntefering|Franz_Müntefering|  and made  |Frank_Walter_Steinmeier|Frank_Walter_Steinmeier|  its leading candidate for the federal election in September 2009.     As a result of  |that_federal_election|2009_German_Federal_Election| , the grand coalition brought losses for both parties and came to an end. The SPD suffered the heaviest losses in its history and was unable to form a coalition government. The CDU/CSU had only little losses but also reached a new historic low with its worst result since 1949. The three smaller parties thus had more seats in the German Bundestag than ever before, with the liberal party FDP winning 14.6% of votes.                  The CDU/CSU and FDP together held 332 seats and had been in coalition since 27 October 2009. Angela Merkel was re-elected as chancellor, and  |Guido_Westerwelle|Guido_Westerwelle|  served as the  |foreign_minister|Foreign_Office|  and vice chancellor of Germany. After being elected into the federal government, the FDP suffered heavy losses in the following state elections. The FDP had promised to lower taxes in the electoral campaign, but after being part of the coalition they had to concede that this was not possible due to the  |economic_crisis|Great_Recession|  of 2008. Because of the losses, Guido Westerwelle had to resign as chair of the FDP in favor of  |Philipp_Rösler|Philipp_Rösler| ,  |Federal_minister_of_health|Federal_Ministry_Of_Health| , who was consequently appointed as  |vice_chancellor|Vice_Chancellor_Of_Germany| . Shortly after, Philipp Rösler changed office and became  |federal_minister_of_economics_and_technology|Federal_Ministry_Of_Economics_And_Technology| .     After their electoral fall, the Social Democrats were led by  |Sigmar_Gabriel|Sigmar_Gabriel| , a former federal minister and prime minister of Lower Saxony, and by  |Frank_Walter_Steinmeier|Frank_Walter_Steinmeier|  as the head of the parliamentary group. He resigned on 16 January 2017 and proposed his longtime friend and president of  |European_Parliament|European_Parliament| |_Martin_Schulz|Martin_Schulz|  as his successor and chancellor candidate.    Germany has seen increased political activity by citizens outside the established political parties with respect to local and  |environmental|Environmental_Activism|  issues such as the location of  |Stuttgart_21|Stuttgart_21| , a railway hub, and construction of  |Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport|Berlin_Brandenburg_Airport| .              The 18th federal elections in Germany resulted in the re-election of  |Angela_Merkel|Angela_Merkel|  and her Christian democratic parliamentary group of the parties  |CDU|Christian_Democratic_Union_Of_Germany|  and CSU, receiving 41.5% of all votes. Following Merkels first two historically low results, her third campaign marked the CDU/CSUs best result since 1994 and only for the second time in German history the possibility of gaining an absolute majority. Their former coalition partner, the FDP, narrowly failed to reach the 5% threshold and did not gain seats in the  |Bundestag|Bundestag| .      Not having reached an absolute majority, the CDU/CSU formed a  |grand_coalition|Grand_Coalition|  with the social-democratic  |SPD|Spd|  after the longest coalition talks in history, making the head of the party  |Sigmar_Gabriel|Sigmar_Gabriel| |_vice_chancellor|Vice_Chancellor_Of_Germany|  and federal  |Minister_for_Economic_Affairs_and_Energy|Federal_Ministry_For_Economic_Affairs_And_Energy| . Together they held 504 of a total 631 seats . The only two opposition parties were The Left and Alliance 90/The Greens , which was acknowledged as creating a critical situation in which the opposition parties did not even have enough seats to use the special controlling powers of the opposition.              The 19th federal elections in Germany took place on 24 September 2017. The two big parties, the conservative parliamentary group  |CDU_CSU|Cdu_Csu|  and the social democrat  |SPD|Social_Democratic_Party_Of_Germany|  were in a similar situation as in 2009, after the last grand coalition had ended, and both had suffered severe losses; reaching their second worst and worst result respectively in 2017.     Many votes in the 2017 elections went to smaller parties, leading the right-wing populist party  |AfD|Alternative_For_Germany|  into the  |Bundestag|Bundestag|  which marked a big shift in German politics since it was the first far-right party to win seats in parliament since the 1950s.     With Merkels candidacy for a fourth term, the CDU/CSU only reached 33.0% of the votes, but won the highest number of seats, leaving no realistic coalition option without the CDU/CSU. As all parties in the Bundestag strictly ruled out a coalition with the AfD, the only options for a majority coalition were a so-called  |_Jamaican_coalition|Germany_Coalition|   and a grand coalition with the SPD, which was at first opposed by the Social Democrats and their leader  |Martin_Schulz|Martin_Schulz| .     Coalition talks between the three Jamaican parties were held but the final proposal was rejected by the liberals of the FDP, leaving the government in limbo.   Following the unprecedented situation, for the first time in German history different minority coalitions or even direct snap coalitions were also heavily discussed. At this point,  |Federal_President|President_Of_Germany| |_Steinmeier|Frank_Walter_Steinmeier|  invited leaders of all parties for talks about a government, being the first President in the history of the Federal Republic to do so.     Official coalition talks between CDU/CSU and SPD started in January 2018 and led to a renewal of the grand coalition on 12 March 2018 as well as the subsequent re-election of Angela Merkel as chancellor.             The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany is the Constitution of Germany.  It was formally approved on 8 May 1949, and, with the signature of the  |Allies_of_World_War_II|Allies_Of_World_War_Ii|  on 12 May, came into effect on 23 May, as the constitution of those states of  |West_Germany|West_Germany|  that were initially included within the Federal Republic. The 1949 Basic Law is a response to the perceived flaws of the 1919  |Weimar_Constitution|Weimar_Constitution| , which failed to prevent the rise of the Nazi party in 1933. Since 1990, in the course of the reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Basic Law also applies to the eastern states of the former  |German_Democratic_Republic|East_Germany| .                          The German head of state is the Federal President. As in Germanys  |parliamentary_system|Parliamentary_System|  of government, the  |Federal_Chancellor|Chancellor_Of_Germany|  runs the government and day-to-day politics, the role of the Federal President is mostly ceremonial. The Federal President, by their actions and public appearances, represents the state itself, its existence, its legitimacy, and unity. Their office involves an integrative role. Website of the Federal President of Germany  Retrieved 13 April 2014 Nearly all actions of the Federal President become valid only after a  |countersignature|Countersignature|  of a government member.     The President is not obliged by Constitution to refrain from political views. He or she is expected to give direction to general political and societal debates, but not in a way that links him to party politics. Most German Presidents were active politicians and party members prior to the office, which means that they have to change their political style when becoming President. The function comprises the official residence of  |Bellevue_Palace|Bellevue_Palace| .     Under Article 59 of the  |Basic_Law|Basic_Law_For_The_Federal_Republic_Of_Germany| , the Federal President represents the Federal Republic of Germany in matters of international law, concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and accredits diplomats. Website of the Federal President of Germany  Retrieved 28 April 2014.     All federal laws must be signed by the President before they can come into effect; he or she does not have a veto, but the conditions for refusing to sign a law on the basis of unconstitutionality are the subject of debate.  The office is currently held by  |Frank_Walter_Steinmeier|Frank_Walter_Steinmeier|  .     The Federal President does have a role in the political system, especially at the establishment of a new government and the dissolution of the Bundestag . This role is usually nominal but can become significant in case of political instability. Additionally, a Federal President together with the Federal Council can support the government in a legislatory emergency state to enable laws against the will of the Bundestag . However, until now the Federal President has never had to use these  |reserve_powers|Reserve_Power|  .               The  Bundeskanzler  heads the  Bundesregierung  and thus the  |executive_branch|Executive_Branch|  of the federal government. They are elected by and responsible to the  Bundestag , Germanys parliament. The other members of the government are the Federal Ministers; they are chosen by the Chancellor. Germany, like the United Kingdom, can thus be classified as a  |parliamentary_system|Parliamentary_System| . The office is currently held by  |Angela_Merkel|Angela_Merkel|  .     The Chancellor cannot be removed from office during a four-year term unless the Bundestag has agreed on a successor. This  |constructive_vote_of_no_confidence|Constructive_Vote_Of_No_Confidence|  is intended to avoid a similar situation to that of the  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic|  in which the executive did not have enough support in the legislature to govern effectively, but the legislature was too divided to name a successor. The current system also prevents the Chancellor from calling a  |snap_election|Snap_Election| .     Except in the periods 1969–1972 and 1976–1982, when the Social Democratic party of Chancellor Brandt and Schmidt came in second in the elections, the chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party, usually supported by a coalition of two parties with a majority in the parliament. The chancellor appoints one of the federal ministers as their deputy, Article 69 of the Basic Law who has the unofficial title  |Vice_Chancellor|Vice_Chancellor_Of_Germany|  . The office is currently held by  |Olaf_Scholz|Olaf_Scholz|  .            The German Cabinet is the chief  |executive|Executive_Branch|  body of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Bundestag is directly elected by the German people, while the Bundesrat represents the governments of the regional states . The federal legislature has powers of  |exclusive_jurisdiction|Exclusive_Jurisdiction|  and  |concurrent_jurisdiction|Concurrent_Jurisdiction|  with the states in areas specified in the constitution.     The Bundestag is more powerful than the Bundesrat and only needs the latters consent for proposed legislation related to revenue shared by the federal and state governments, and the imposition of responsibilities on the states. In practice, however, the agreement of the Bundesrat in the legislative process is often required, since federal legislation frequently has to be executed by state or local agencies. In the event of disagreement between the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, either side can appeal to the  to find a compromise.            The Bundestag is elected for a four-year term and consists of 598 or more members elected by a means of  |mixed_member_proportional_representation|Mixed_Member_Proportional_Representation| , which Germans call personalised proportional representation . 299 members represent single-seat  |constituencies|Constituency|  and are elected by a  |first_past_the_post_electoral_system|First_Past_The_Post_Electoral_System| . Parties that obtain fewer constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allotted seats from party lists to make up the difference. In contrast, parties that obtain more constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allowed to keep these so-called  |overhang_seats|Overhang_Seat| . In the parliament that was elected in 2009, there were 24 overhang seats, giving the Bundestag a total of 622 members. After Bundestag elections since 2013, other parties obtain extra seats that offset advantages from their rivals overhang seats. The current Bundestag is the largest in German history with 709 members.     A party must receive either five percent of the national vote or win at least three directly elected seats to be eligible for non-constituency seats in the Bundestag. This rule, often called the five percent hurdle , was incorporated into Germanys election law to prevent political fragmentation and strong minor parties. The first Bundestag elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany on 14 August 1949. Following reunification,  |elections_for_the_first_all_German_Bundestag|1990_German_Federal_Election|  were held on 2 December 1990. The last  |federal_election|2017_German_Federal_Election|  was held on 24 September 2017.             Germany follows the  |civil_law_tradition|Civil_Law| .

The  |Federal_Court_of_Justice_of_Germany|Federal_Court_Of_Justice_Of_Germany|   is the highest ordinary court and also the highest court of appeals.   Specialized courts hear cases related to  |administrative|Administrative_Law| ,  |labour|Labour_Law| , social, fiscal and  |patent_law|Patent_Law| .   Constitutional courts focus on judicial review and constitutional interpretation. The  |Federal_Constitutional_Court|Federal_Constitutional_Court|   is the highest court dealing with constitutional matters.       The main difference between the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court of Justice is that the Federal Constitutional Court may only be called if a constitutional matter within a case is in question , while the Federal Court of Justice may be called in any case.
