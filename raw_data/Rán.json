The section traces the kenning to a narrative surrounding Ægir, in which the jötunn employs glowing gold in the center of his hall to light it like fire . The section explains that Ran is the name of Ægirs wife, and the names of their nine daughters are as was written above ... Then the Æsir discovered that Ran had a net in which she caught everyone that went to sea ... so this is the story of the origin of gold being called fire or light or brightness of Ægir, Ran or Ægirs daughters, and from such kennings the practice has now developed of calling gold fire of the sea and of all terms for it, since Ægir and Rans names are also terms for the sea, and hence gold is now called fire of lakes or rivers and of all river-names.
