Anishinaabe g say the name Kickapoo  means Stands here and there, which may have referred to the tribes migratory patterns. The name can also mean wanderer . This interpretation is contested and generally believed to be a  |folk_etymology|Folk_Etymology| .     Today there are three  |federally_recognized|Federally_Recognized_Tribe|  Kickapoo tribes in the  |United_States|United_States| |Kickapoo_Tribe_of_Indians_of_the_Kickapoo_Reservation_in_Kansas|Kickapoo_Tribe_Of_Indians_Of_The_Kickapoo_Reservation_In_Kansas| , the  |Kickapoo_Tribe_of_Oklahoma|Kickapoo_Tribe_Of_Oklahoma| , and the  |Kickapoo_Traditional_Tribe_of_Texas|Kickapoo_Traditional_Tribe_Of_Texas| . The Oklahoma and Texas bands are politically associated with each other. The Kickapoo in Kansas came from a relocation from southern Missouri in 1832 as a land exchange from their reserve there.  Around 3,000 people are enrolled tribal members. Another band, the  |Tribu_Kikapú|Mexican_Kickapoo| , resides in  |Múzquiz_Municipality|Múzquiz_Municipality|  in the  |Mexican|Mexico|  state of  |Coahuila|Coahuila| . Smaller bands live in  |Sonora|Sonora|  and  |Durango|Durango| .            The Kickapoo were an  |Algonquian-language|Algonquian_Languages|  people who likely migrated to or developed as a people in a large territory along the  |Wabash_River|Wabash_River|  in the area of modern  |Terre_Haute,_Indiana|Terre_Haute,_Indiana| . They were confederated with the larger  |Wabash_Confederacy|Wabash_Confederacy| , which included the  |Piankeshaw|Piankeshaw|  to their south, the  |Wea|Wea|  to their north, and the powerful  |Miami_Tribe|Miami_Tribe| , to their east. A subgroup occupied the  |Upper_Iowa_River|Upper_Iowa_River|  region in what was later known as northeast  |Iowa|Iowa|  and the  |Root_River|Root_River|  region in southeast  |Minnesota|Minnesota|  in the late 1600s and early 1700s. This group was probably known by the clan name Mahouea , derived from the Illinoian word for wolf, mhwea.      The earliest European contact with the Kickapoo tribe occurred during the  |La_Salle_Expeditions|La_Salle_Expeditions|  into  |Illinois_Country|Illinois_Country|  in the late 17th century. The French colonists set up remote  |fur_trading|Fur_Trading|  posts throughout the region, including on the  |Wabash_River|Wabash_River| . They typically would set up posts at or near Native American villages, and Terre Haute was founded as a French village. The Kickapoo had to contend with a changing cast of Europeans; the British defeated the French in the  |Seven_Years_War|Seven_Years_War|  and took over nominal rule of this area after 1763. They increased their own trading with the Kickapoo.     The United States acquired this territory east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River after it gained independence from the United Kingdom. As white settlers moved into the region from the United States eastern areas, beginning in the early 19th century, the Kickapoo were under pressure. They negotiated with the United States over their territory in several treaties, including the  |Treaty_of_Vincennes|Treaty_Of_Vincennes| , the  |Treaty_of_Grouseland|Treaty_Of_Grouseland| , and the  |Treaty_of_Fort_Wayne|Treaty_Of_Fort_Wayne| . They sold most of their lands to the United States and moved north to settle among the Wea.     Rising tensions between the regional tribes and the United States led to  |Tecumsehs_War|Tecumsehs_War|  in 1811. The Kickapoo were one of Tecumsehs closest allies. Many Kickapoo warriors participated in the  |Battle_of_Tippecanoe|Battle_Of_Tippecanoe|  and the subsequent  |War_of_1812|Indiana_In_The_War_Of_1812|  on the side of the British, hoping to expel the American settlers from the region. A prominent, nonviolent spiritual leader among the Kickapoo was  |Kennekuk|Kennekuk| , who led his followers during  |Indian_Removal|Indian_Removal|  in the 1830s to their current tribal lands in Kansas. He died there in 1852.     The close of the war led to a change of federal Indian policy in the  |Indiana_Territory|Indiana_Territory| , and later the state of  |Indiana|Indiana| . American leaders began to advocate the  |removal_of_tribes|Indian_Removals_In_Indiana|  to lands west of the  |Mississippi_River|Mississippi_River| , to extinguish their claims to lands wanted by American settlers. The Kickapoo were among the first tribes to leave Indiana under this program. They accepted land in  |Kansas|Kansas|  and an annual subsidy in exchange for leaving the state.          Kickapoo speak an  |Algonquian|Algonquian_Languages|  language closely related to that of the  |Sauk_and_Fox|Fox_Language| . They are classified with the Central Algonquians, and are also related to the  |Illinois_Confederation|Illinois_Confederation| .     In 1985 the Kickapoo Nations School in  |Horton,_Kansas|Horton,_Kansas| , began a language immersion program for elementary school grades to revive teaching and use of the Kickapoo language in grades K-6.  Efforts in language education continue at most Kickapoo sites. In 2010, the Head Start Program at the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas reservation, which teaches the Kickapoo language, became the first Native American school to earn Texas School Ready! Project certification.      Also in 2010, Mexicos  |Instituto_Nacional_de_Antropología_e_Historia|Instituto_Nacional_De_Antropología_E_Historia|  participated in the elaboration of a Kickapoo alphabet that may be used by more than 700 members of the group that dwell in Mexico and the United States, in the states of Coahuila and Texas. Previously no Kickapoo alphabet was used in Mexico; although there is a syllabic writing system it has no element ordination, organization or classification method.    The Kickapoo in Mexico are known for their  |whistled_speech|Kickapoo_Whistled_Speech| .     Texts,    recordings,  and a vocabulary  of the language are available.     The Kickapoo language and members of the Kickapoo tribe were featured in the movie  The Only Good Indian  , directed by Greg Wilmott and starring  |Wes_Studi|Wes_Studi| . This was a fictionalized account of Native American children forced to attend an Indian boarding school, where they were forced to speak English and give up their cultures.

These Kickapoo were granted their own reservation in 1883 and became recognized as the  |Kickapoo_Tribe_of_Oklahoma|Kickapoo_Tribe_Of_Oklahoma| .     The reservation was short-lived. In 1893 under the Dawes Act, their communal tribal lands were broken up  and assigned to separate member households by allotments. The tribes government was dismantled by the  |Curtis_Act_of_1898|Curtis_Act_Of_1898| , which encouraged assimilation by Native Americans to the majority culture. Tribal members struggled under these conditions.     In the 1930s the federal and state governments encouraged tribes to reorganize their governments.
