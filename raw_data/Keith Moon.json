In the words of the drummer, they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guys drums and did one song-Road Runner. Id several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: You ... come ere. I said, mild as you please: Yes, yes? And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: What are you doing next Monday? I said: Nothing. I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: Youll have to give up work ... theres this gig on Monday. If you want to come, well pick you up in the van. I said: Right. And that was it.  Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had just been filling in for the last fifteen years.      Moons arrival in the Who changed the dynamics of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moons temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. We used to fight regularly, remembered Moon in later years. ": null

Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music, he said in a later interview.  Although Townshend described him as a completely different person to anyone Ive ever met,  the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moons drumming style affected the bands musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moons lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.     Moon was particularly fond of touring, since it was his only chance to regularly socialise with his bandmates, and was generally restless and bored when not playing live. This later carried over to other aspects of his life, as he acted them out  as if his life were one long tour.  These antics earned him the nickname Moon the Loon.             Moons style of drumming was considered unique by his bandmates, although they sometimes found his unconventional playing frustrating; Entwistle noted that he tended to play faster or slower according to his mood. He wouldnt play across his kit, he later added. Hed play zig-zag. Thats why he had two sets of tom-toms. Hed move his arms forward like a skier.  Daltrey said that Moon just instinctively put drum fills in places that other people would never have thought of putting them.

Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing cost as much as £300,000 . These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moons way of demonstrating his eccentricity; he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant Butler observed, He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny, he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far. Like a train ride you couldnt stop.      In a limousine on the way to the airport Moon insisted they return to their hotel, saying I forgot something.

The destruction mesmerised him, and enhanced his public image as rocks premier hell-raiser. Tony Fletcher wrote that no toilet in a hotel or changing room was safe until Moon had exhausted his supply of explosives.     Pete Townshend walked into the bathroom of Moons hotel room and noticed the toilet had disappeared, with only the S-bend remaining. The drummer explained that since a cherry bomb was about to explode, he had thrown it down the loo and showed Townshend the case of cherry bombs. And of course from that moment on, the guitarist remembered, we got thrown out of every hotel we ever stayed in.      Entwistle recalled being close to Moon on tour: I suppose we were two of a kind ...  We shared a room on the road and got up to no good. Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets.

A hotel manager called Moon in his room and asked him to lower the volume on his cassette recorder because it made too much noise. In response the drummer asked him up to his room, excused himself to go to the bathroom, put a lit stick of dynamite in the toilet and shut the bathroom door. Upon returning, he asked the manager to stay for a moment, as he wanted to explain something. Following the explosion, Moon turned the recorder back on and said, That, dear boy, was noise.

Daltrey later denied threatening to fire him, but said that by this time the drummer was out of control.       Because the Whos early stage act relied on smashing instruments, and owing to Moons enthusiasm for damaging hotels, the group were in debt for much of the 1960s; Entwistle estimated they lost about £150,000. Even when the group became relatively financially stable after Tommy, Moon continued to rack up debts. He bought a number of cars and gadgets, and flirted with bankruptcy. Moons recklessness with money reduced his profit from the groups 1975 UK tour to £47.35 .

He followed Moon when the drummer relocated to Los Angeles, but felt that the drug culture prevalent at the time was bad for Moon: My job was to have eyes in the back of my head. Townshend agreed, saying that by 1975 Butler had no influence over him whatsoever.  Although he was a loyal companion to Moon, the lifestyle eventually became too much for him; he phoned Curbishley, saying that they needed to move back to England or one of them might die. Butler quit in 1978, and later wrote of his experiences in a book entitled Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of Keith Moon.

By September 1978 Moon was having difficulty playing the drums, according to roadie Dave Cy Langston. After seeing Moon in the studio trying to overdub drums for The Kids Are Alright, he said, After two or three hours, he got more and more sluggish, he could barely hold a drum stick.

Entwistle was giving an interview to French journalists when he was interrupted by a phone call with the news of Moons death. Trying to tactfully and quickly end the interview, he broke down and wept when the journalist asked him about the Whos future plans.     Moons death came shortly after the release of  Who Are You . On the album cover, he is straddling a chair to hide his weight gain; the words Not to be taken away are on the back of the chair.
