            Lead  is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Pb  and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  82. It is a  |heavy_metal|Heavy_Metals|  that is  |denser|Density|  than most common materials. Lead is  |soft|Mohs_Scale_Of_Mineral_Hardnessintermediate_Hardness|  and  |malleable|Malleable| , and also has a relatively low  |melting_point|Melting_Point| . When freshly cut, lead is silvery with a hint of blue; it  |tarnish|Tarnish| es to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any  |stable_element|Stable_Nuclide|  and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear  |decay_chains|Decay_Chain|  of heavier elements.     Lead is a relatively unreactive  |post-transition_metal|Post-Transition_Metal| . Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its  |amphoteric|Amphoteric|  nature; lead and  |lead_oxides|Lead_Oxide|  react with  |acids|Acid|  and  |bases|Base| , and it tends to form  |covalent_bonds|Covalent_Bond| .  |Compounds_of_lead|Compounds_Of_Lead|  are usually found in the +2  |oxidation_state|Oxidation_State|  rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the  |carbon_group|Carbon_Group| . Exceptions are mostly limited to  |organolead_compounds|Organolead_Compound| . Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to  |bond_with_itself|Catenation| ; it can form chains and polyhedral structures.     Lead is easily extracted from its  |ores|Ore| ; prehistoric people in Western Asia  |knew_of_it|Metals_Of_Antiquity| .  |Galena|Galena| , a principal ore of lead, often bears  |silver|Silver| , interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in  |ancient_Rome|Ancient_Rome| . Lead production declined after the  |fall_of_Rome|Fall_Of_The_Western_Roman_Empire|  and did not reach comparable levels until the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| . In 2014, the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Leads high density, low melting point,  |ductility|Ductility|  and relative inertness to  |oxidation|Oxidation|  make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction,  |plumbing|Plumbing| ,  |batteries|Lead–Acid_Batteries| ,  |bullets|Bullet|  and  |shot|Lead_Shot| , weights,  |solders|Solder| ,  |pewters|Pewter| ,  |fusible_alloys|Fusible_Alloy| ,  |white_paints|Lead_Paint| ,  |leaded_gasoline|Leaded_Gasoline| , and  |radiation_shield|Radiation_Shield| ing.     In the late 19th century,  |leads_toxicity|Lead_Poisoning|  was recognized, and its use has since been phased out of many applications. However, many countries still allow the sale of products that expose humans to lead, including some types of paints and bullets. Lead is a  |neurotoxin|Neurotoxin|  that accumulates in soft tissues and bones; it damages the  |nervous_system|Nervous_System|  and interferes with the function of biological enzymes, causing neurological disorders, such as brain damage and behavioral problems.           A lead  |atom|Atom|  has 82  |electrons|Electron| , arranged in an  |electron_configuration|Electron_Configuration|  of & 91; |Xe|Xenon|  & 93;4f 14 5d 10 6s 2 6p 2 . The sum of leads first and second  |ionization_energies|Ionization_Energy| —the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons—is close to that of  |tin|Tin| , leads upper neighbor in the  |carbon_group|Carbon_Group| . This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an elements outer electrons become more distant from the  |nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus| , and more  |shielded|Shielding_Effect|  by smaller orbitals. The similarity of ionization energies is caused by the  |lanthanide_contraction|Lanthanide_Contraction| —the decrease in element  |radii|Atomic_Radius|  from  |lanthanum|Lanthanum|  to  |lutetium|Lutetium|  , and the relatively small radii of the elements from  |hafnium|Hafnium|  onwards. This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the  |lanthanide|Lanthanide|  4f electrons. The sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that of tin, contrary to what  |periodic_trends|Periodic_Trends|  would predict.  |Relativistic_effects|Relativistic_Quantum_Chemistry| , which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this behavior. One such effect is the  |inert_pair_effect|Inert_Pair_Effect| |crystalline|Crystalline|  lead unusually long.     Leads lighter carbon group  |congeners|Congener|  form stable or metastable  |allotropes|Allotrope|  with the tetrahedrally coordinated and  |covalently_bonded|Covalent_Bond| |diamond_cubic|Diamond_Cubic|  structure. The energy levels of their outer  |s-|S-Orbital|  and  |p-orbitals|P-Orbital|  are close enough to allow mixing into four  |hybrid|Orbital_Hybridisation|  sp 3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms  |metallic_bonds|Metallic_Bonding|  in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb 2+ ions. Lead consequently has a  |face-centered_cubic|Cubic_Crystal_System|  structure like the similarly sized  |divalent|Divalent|  metals  |calcium|Calcium|  and  |strontium|Strontium| .       Pure lead has a bright, silvery appearance with a hint of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air and takes on a dull appearance, the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high  |density|Density| , malleability, ductility, and high resistance to  |corrosion|Corrosion|  due to  |passivation|Passivation| .        Leads close-packed face-centered cubic structure and high atomic weight result in a density of 11.34  g/cm 3 , which is greater than that of common metals such as  |iron|Iron|  ,  |copper|Copper|  , and  |zinc|Zinc|  . This density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon. Some rarer metals are denser:  |tungsten|Tungsten|  and  |gold|Gold|  are both at 19.3  g/cm 3 , and  |osmium|Osmium| —the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59  g/cm 3 , almost twice that of lead.     Lead is a very soft metal with a  |Mohs_hardness|Mohs_Hardness|  of 1.5; it can be scratched with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The  |bulk_modulus|Bulk_Modulus|  of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8   |GPa|Pascal| . In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2  GPa; copper 137.8  GPa; and  |mild_steel|Mild_Steel|  160–169  GPa. Leads  |tensile_strength|Tensile_Strength| , at 12–17 MPa, is low ; it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or  |antimony|Antimony| .     The melting point of lead—at 327.5  °C —is very low compared to most metals. Its  |boiling_point|Boiling_Point|  of 1749  °C  is the lowest among the carbon group elements. The  |electrical_resistivity|Electrical_Resistivity_And_Conductivity|  of lead at 20  °C is 192  |nanoohm|Ohm| - |meters|Meter| , almost an  |order_of_magnitude|Order_Of_Magnitude|  higher than those of other industrial metals . Lead is a  |superconductor|Superconductor|  at temperatures lower than 7.19   |K|Kelvin| ; this is the highest  |critical_temperature|Critical_Temperature|  of all  |type-I_superconductors|Type-I_Superconductor|  and the third highest of the elemental superconductors.                    Natural lead consists of four stable  |isotopes|Isotope|  with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with leads  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  being even. Lead has a  |magic_number|Magic_Number|  of protons , for which the  |nuclear_shell_model|Nuclear_Shell_Model|  accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, which may explain why lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.     With its high atomic number, lead is the heaviest element whose natural isotopes are regarded as stable; lead-208 is the heaviest stable nucleus.  The four stable isotopes of lead could theoretically undergo  |alpha_decay|Alpha_Decay|  to isotopes of  |mercury|Mercury|  with a release of energy, but this has not been observed for any of them; their predicted half-lives range from 10 35 to 10 189 years .     Three of the stable isotopes are found in three of the four major  |decay_chains|Decay_Chains|  These decay chains are called the uranium chain, the actinium chain, and the thorium chain. Their isotopic concentrations in a natural rock sample depends greatly on the presence of these three parent uranium and thorium isotopes. For example, the relative abundance of lead-208 can range from 52% in normal samples to 90% in thorium ores; for this reason, the standard atomic weight of lead is given to only one decimal place. As time passes, the ratio of lead-206 and lead-207 to lead-204 increases, since the former two are supplemented by radioactive decay of heavier elements while the latter is not; this allows for  |lead–lead_dating|Lead–Lead_Dating| . As uranium decays into lead, their relative amounts change; this is the basis for  |uranium–lead_dating|Uranium–Lead_Dating| . Lead-207 exhibits  |nuclear_magnetic_resonance|Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance| , a property that has been used to study its compounds in solution and solid state, including in human body.        Apart from the stable isotopes, which make up almost all lead that exists naturally, there are  |trace_quantities|Trace_Radioisotope|  of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 . Lead-211, -212, and -214 are present in the decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare  |cluster_decay|Cluster_Decay|  of radium-223, one of the  |daughter_products|Daughter_Product|  of natural uranium-235, and the decay chain of neptunium-237, traces of which are produced by  |neutron_capture|Neutron_Capture|  in uranium ores. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 .     In total, 43 lead isotopes have been synthesized, with mass numbers 178–220. Lead-205 is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of around 1.73  years. The second-most stable is lead-202, which has a half-life of about 52,500  years, longer than any of the natural trace radioisotopes.               Bulk lead exposed to moist air forms a protective layer of varying composition.  |Lead_carbonate|Lead_Carbonate|  is a common constituent; the  |sulfate|Lead_Sulfate|  or  |chloride|Lead_Chloride|  may also be present in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air. Finely powdered lead, as with many metals, is  |pyrophoric|Pyrophoricity| , and burns with a bluish-white flame.      |Fluorine|Fluorine|  reacts with lead at room temperature, forming  |lead_fluoride|Lead_Fluoride| . The reaction with  |chlorine|Chlorine|  is similar but requires heating, as the resulting chloride layer diminishes the reactivity of the elements. Molten lead reacts with the  |chalcogens|Chalcogen|  to give lead chalcogenides.     Lead metal resists  |sulfuric|Sulfuric_Acid|  and  |phosphoric_acid|Phosphoric_Acid|  but not  |hydrochloric|Hydrochloric_Acid|  or  |nitric_acid|Nitric_Acid| ; the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation of the product salt. Organic acids, such as  |acetic_acid|Acetic_Acid| , dissolve lead in the presence of oxygen. Concentrated  |alkalis|Alkali|  will dissolve lead and form  |plumbites|Plumbite| .          Lead shows two main oxidation states: +4 and +2. The  |tetravalent|Tetravalent|  state is common for the carbon group. The divalent state is rare for  |carbon|Carbon|  and  |silicon|Silicon| , minor for germanium, important for tin, and is the more important of the two oxidation states for lead. This is attributable to  |relativistic_effects|Relativistic_Quantum_Chemistry| , specifically the  |inert_pair_effect|Inert_Pair_Effect| , which manifests itself when there is a large difference in  |electronegativity|Electronegativity|  between lead and  |oxide|Oxide| ,  |halide|Halide| , or  |nitride|Nitride|  anions, leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. The inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity, such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp 3 hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds.     There is a relatively large difference in the electronegativity of lead at 1.87 and lead at 2.33. This difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the +4 oxidation state going down the carbon group; tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 oxidation state and 1.96 in the +4 state.            Lead compounds are characteristic of the inorganic chemistry of lead. Even strong  |oxidizing_agents|Oxidizing_Agent|  like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF 2 and PbCl 2 . Lead ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb + and finally 4+ , but are not  |reducing_agents|Reducing_Agent|  as tin ions are.  |Techniques|Qualitative_Inorganic_Analysis|  for identifying the presence of the Pb 2+ ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is sparingly soluble in water, in very dilute solutions the precipitation of lead sulfide is achieved by bubbling  |hydrogen_sulfide|Hydrogen_Sulfide|  through the solution.      |Lead_monoxide|Lead_Monoxide|  exists in two  |polymorphs|Polymorphism| ,  |litharge|Litharge|  α-PbO and  |massicot|Massicot|  β-PbO , the latter being stable only above around 488  °C. Litharge is the most commonly used inorganic compound of lead. There is no lead hydroxide; increasing the pH of solutions of lead salts leads to hydrolysis and condensation.   Lead commonly reacts with heavier chalcogens. Lead sulfide is a  |semiconductor|Semiconductor| , a  |photoconductor|Photoconductor| , and an extremely sensitive  |infrared_radiation_detector|Particle_Detector| . The other two chalcogenides,  |lead_selenide|Lead_Selenide|  and  |lead_telluride|Lead_Telluride| , are likewise photoconducting. They are unusual in that their color becomes lighter going down the group.        Lead dihalides are well-characterized; this includes the diastatide and mixed halides, such as PbFCl. The relative insolubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the  |gravimetric|Gravimetric_Analysis|  determination of fluorine. The difluoride was the first solid  |ionically_conducting|Ionic_Conductivity|  compound to be discovered . The other dihalides decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light, especially the diiodide. Many lead  |pseudohalides|Pseudohalogen|  are known, such as the  |cyanide|Lead_Cyanide| ,  |cyanate|Lead_Cyanate| , and  |thiocyanate|Lead_Thiocyanate| . Lead forms an extensive variety of halide  |coordination_complex|Coordination_Complex| es, such as 2− , 4− , and the n 5n− chain anion.      |Lead_sulfate|Lead_Sulfate|  is insoluble in water, like the sulfates of other heavy divalent  |cations|Cation| . Lead nitrate and  |lead_acetate|Lead_Acetate|  are very soluble, and this is exploited in the synthesis of other lead compounds.       Few inorganic lead compounds are known. They are only formed in highly oxidizing solutions and do not normally exist under standard conditions. Lead oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb 3 O 4 . It is described as  |lead_oxide|Lead_Oxide| , or structurally 2PbO·PbO 2 , and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound.  |Lead_dioxide|Lead_Dioxide|  is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl 4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl 2 and Cl 2 . Analogously to  |lead_monoxide|Lead_Monoxide| , lead dioxide is capable of forming  |plumbate|Plumbate|  anions.  |Lead_disulfide|Lead_Disulfide|  and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures.  |Lead_tetrafluoride|Lead_Tetrafluoride| , a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the  |difluoride|Lead_Difluoride| .  |Lead_tetrachloride|Lead_Tetrachloride|  decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, and the existence of lead tetraiodide is questionable.                 Some lead compounds exist in formal oxidation states other than +4 or +2. Lead may be obtained, as an intermediate between lead and lead, in larger organolead complexes; this oxidation state is not stable, as both the lead ion and the larger complexes containing it are  |radicals|Radical| . The same applies for lead, which can be found in such radical species.     Numerous mixed lead oxides are known. When PbO 2 is heated in air, it becomes Pb 12 O 19 at 293  °C, Pb 12 O 17 at 351  °C, Pb 3 O 4 at 374  °C, and finally PbO at 605  °C. A further  |sesquioxide|Sesquioxide| , Pb 2 O 3 , can be obtained at high pressure, along with several non-stoichiometric phases. Many of them show defective  |fluorite|Fluorite|  structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies: PbO can be considered as having such a structure, with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent.     Negative oxidation states can occur as  |Zintl_phases|Zintl_Phases| , as either free lead anions, as in Ba 2 Pb, with lead formally being lead, or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions such as the  |trigonal_bipyramidal|Trigonal_Bipyramidal_Molecular_Geometry|  Pb 5 2− ion, where two lead atoms are lead and three are lead. In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp 3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external  |lone_pair|Lone_Pair| . They may be made in  |liquid_ammonia|Liquid_Ammonia|  via the reduction of lead by  |sodium|Sodium| .                      Lead can form  |multiply-bonded_chains|Catenation| , a property it shares with its lighter  |homologs|Homology|  in the carbon group. Its capacity to do so is much less because the Pb–Pb  |bond_energy|Bond_Energy|  is over three and a half times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself, lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds . This makes the  |organometallic_chemistry|Organometallic_Chemistry|  of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. Lead predominantly forms organolead compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead reactants; very few organolead compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb 2 and Pb 2 .     The lead analog of the simplest  |organic_compound|Organic_Compound| ,  |methane|Methane| , is  |plumbane|Plumbane| . Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and  |atomic_hydrogen|Atomic_Hydrogen| . Two simple derivatives,  |tetramethyllead|Tetramethyllead|  and  |tetraethyllead|Tetraethyllead| , are the best-known  |organolead|Organolead|  compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with  |alkyl_halides|Alkyl_Halide|  to form  |organometallic|Organometallic|  compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited:  |lead_tetraacetate|Lead_Tetraacetate|  is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic synthesis, and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.                  Leads per-particle abundance in the  |Solar_System|Solar_System|  is 0.121  |ppb|Parts_Per_Billion|  . This figure is two and a half times higher than that of  |platinum|Platinum| , eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the  |universe|Universe|  is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.     Primordial lead—which comprises the isotopes lead-204, lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208—was mostly created as a result of repetitive neutron capture processes occurring in stars. The two main modes of capture are the  |s-|S-Process|  and  |r-process|R-Process| es.     In the s-process , captures are separated by years or decades, allowing less stable nuclei to undergo  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| . A stable thallium-203 nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium-204; this undergoes beta decay to give stable lead-204; on capturing another neutron, it becomes lead-205, which has a half-life of around 15 million years. Further captures result in lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208. On capturing another neutron, lead-208 becomes lead-209, which quickly decays into bismuth-209. On capturing another neutron, bismuth-209 becomes bismuth-210, and this beta decays to polonium-210, which alpha decays to lead-206. The cycle hence ends at lead-206, lead-207, lead-208, and bismuth-209.        In the r-process , captures happen faster than nuclei can decay. This occurs in environments with a high neutron density, such as a  |supernova|Supernova|  or the merger of two  |neutron_stars|Neutron_Star| . The neutron flux involved may be on the order of 10 22 neutrons per square centimeter per second. The r-process does not form as much lead as the s-process. It tends to stop once neutron-rich nuclei reach 126 neutrons. At this point, the neutrons are arranged in complete shells in the atomic nucleus, and it becomes harder to energetically accommodate more of them. When the neutron flux subsides, these nuclei beta decay into stable isotopes of osmium,  |iridium|Iridium| , and platinum.       Lead is classified as a  |chalcophile|Goldschmidt_Classificationchalcophile_Elements|  under the  |Goldschmidt_classification|Goldschmidt_Classification| , meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur. It rarely occurs in its  |native|Native_Metal| , metallic form. Many lead minerals are relatively light and, over the course of the Earths history, have remained in the  |crust|Earths_Crust|  instead of sinking deeper into the Earths interior. This accounts for leads relatively high  |crustal_abundance|Crustal_Abundance|  of 14 ppm; it is the 38th most  |abundant|Abundances_Of_The_Elements|  element in the crust.     The main lead-bearing mineral is  |galena|Galena|  , which is mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead minerals are related to galena in some way;  |boulangerite|Boulangerite| , Pb 5 Sb 4 S 11 , is a mixed sulfide derived from galena;  |anglesite|Anglesite| , PbSO 4 , is a product of galena oxidation; and  |cerussite|Cerussite|  or white lead ore, PbCO 3 , is a decomposition product of galena.  |Arsenic|Arsenic| , tin, antimony,  |silver|Silver| , gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.        World lead resources exceed two billion tons. Significant deposits are located in Australia, China, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Russia, and the United States. Global reserves—resources that are economically feasible to extract—totaled 88 million tons in 2016, of which Australia had 35 million, China 17 million, and Russia 6.4 million.     Typical background concentrations of lead do not exceed 0.1  μg/m 3 in the atmosphere; 100  mg/kg in soil; and 5  μg/L in freshwater and seawater.       The modern English word lead is of Germanic origin; it comes from the  |Middle_English|Middle_English|  leed and  |Old_English|Old_English|  lēad . The Old English word is derived from the hypothetical reconstructed  |Proto-Germanic|Proto-Germanic_Language|  lauda- . According to linguistic theory, this word bore descendants in multiple Germanic languages of exactly the same meaning.     The origin of the Proto-Germanic lauda- is not agreed in the linguistic community. One hypothesis suggests it is derived from  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European_Language|  lAudh- . Another hypothesis suggests it is borrowed from  |Proto-Celtic|Proto-Celtic_Language|  ɸloud-io- . This word is related to the  |Latin|Latin_Language|  plumbum, which gave the element its  |chemical_symbol|Chemical_Symbol|  Pb. The word ɸloud-io- is thought to be the origin of Proto-Germanic bliwa- , from which stemmed the German Blei.     The name of the chemical element is not related to the verb of the same spelling, which is derived from Proto-Germanic laidijan- .                   Metallic lead beads  |dating_back_to_7000–6500_BCE|Metals_Of_Antiquity|  have been found in  |Asia_Minor|Asia_Minor|  and may represent the first example of metal  |smelting|Smelting| . At that time lead had few applications due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena . The  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| ians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to  |Ancient_Greece|Ancient_Greece|  and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets,  |glazes|Glaze| ,  |glass|Glass| es,  |enamels|Vitreous_Enamel| , and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the  |Fertile_Crescent|Fertile_Crescent|  used lead as a writing material, as currency, and as a construction material. Lead was used in the  |Ancient_Chinese|Ancient_China|  royal court as a  |stimulant|Stimulant| , as currency, and as a  |contraceptive|Birth_Control| ; the  |Indus_Valley_civilization|Indus_Valley_Civilization|  and the  |Mesoamerica|Mesoamerica| ns used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in  |wire_drawing|Wire_Drawing| .       Because silver was extensively used as a decorative material and an exchange medium, lead deposits came to be worked in Asia Minor from 3000  BCE; later, lead deposits were developed in the  |Aegean|Aegean_Islands|  and  |Laurion|Laurion| . These three regions collectively dominated production of mined lead until c. 1200  BCE. Beginning circa 2000  BCE, the  |Phoenicia|Phoenicia| ns worked deposits in the  |Iberian_peninsula|Iberian_Peninsula| ; by 1600  BCE, lead mining existed in  |Cyprus|Cyprus| , Greece, and  |Sardinia|Sardinia| .           |Romes|Roman_Republic|  territorial expansion in Europe and across the Mediterranean, and its development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the  |classical_era|Classical_Antiquity| , with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes. Like their predecessors, the Romans obtained lead mostly as a by-product of silver smelting.  |Lead_mining|Roman_Metallurgy|  occurred in  |Central_Europe|Central_Europe| ,  |Britain|Roman_Britain| , the  |Balkans|Balkans| ,  |Greece|Greece| ,  |Anatolia|Anatolia| , and  |Hispania|Hispania| , the latter accounting for 40% of world production.     Lead tablets were commonly used as a material for letters.  |Lead_coffins|Lead_Coffins| , cast in flat sand forms, with interchangeable motifs to suit the faith of the deceased were used in ancient  |Judea|Judea| . Lead was used to make slings bullet from the 5th century BC. In Roman times, lead sling bullets were amply used, and were effective at a distance of between 100 and 150 meters. The Balearic slingers, used as mercenaries in Carthaginian and Roman armies, were famous for their shooting distance and accuracy.      Lead was used for making  |water_pipes|Water_Pipe|  in the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| ; the  |Latin|Latin|  word for the metal, plumbum, is the origin of the English word  |plumbing|Plumbing|  . Its ease of working and resistance to corrosion ensured its widespread use in other applications, including pharmaceuticals, roofing, currency, and warfare. Writers of the time, such as  |Cato_the_Elder|Cato_The_Elder| ,  |Columella|Columella| , and  |Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny_The_Elder| , recommended lead vessels for the preparation of  |sweeteners_and_preservatives|Defrutum|  added to wine and food. The lead conferred an agreeable taste due to the formation of sugar of lead , whereas copper or  |bronze|Bronze|  vessels could impart a bitter flavor through  |verdigris|Verdigris|  formation.          The Roman author  |Vitruvius|Vitruvius|  reported the health dangers of lead and modern writers have suggested that lead poisoning played a major role in the decline of the Roman Empire. Other researchers have criticized such claims, pointing out, for instance, that not all abdominal pain is caused by lead poisoning. According to archaeological research, Roman  |lead_pipes|Lead_Pipe|  increased lead levels in tap water but such an effect was unlikely to have been truly harmful . When lead poisoning did occur, victims were called saturnine , dark and cynical, after the ghoulish father of the gods,  |Saturn|Saturn| . By association, lead was considered the father of all metals. Its status in Roman society was low as it was readily available and cheap.                   During the classical era , tin was often not distinguished from lead: Romans called lead plumbum nigrum , and tin plumbum candidum . The association of lead and tin can be seen in other languages: the word olovo in  |Czech|Czech_Language|  translates to lead , but in  |Russian|Russian_Language| , its  |cognate|Cognate|  олово  means tin . To add to the confusion, lead bore a close relation to antimony: both elements commonly occur as sulfides , often together. Pliny incorrectly wrote that stibnite would give lead on heating, instead of antimony. In countries such as Turkey and India, the originally Persian name surma came to refer to either antimony sulfide or lead sulfide, and in some languages, such as Russian, gave its name to antimony .         Lead mining in Western Europe declined after the fall of the  |Western_Roman_Empire|Western_Roman_Empire| , with  |Arabian_Iberia|Al-Andalus|  being the only region having a significant output. The largest production of lead occurred in South and East Asia, especially China and India, where lead mining grew rapidly.          In Europe, lead production began to increase in the 11th and 12th centuries, when it was again used for roofing and piping. Starting in the 13th century, lead was used to create  |stained_glass|Medieval_Stained_Glass| . In the  |European|Alchemymedieval_Europe|  and  |Arabian|Alchemy_And_Chemistry_In_Medieval_Islam|  traditions of  |alchemy|Alchemy| , lead  was considered an impure  |base_metal|Base_Metal|  which, by the separation, purification and balancing of its constituent essences, could be transformed to pure and incorruptible gold. During the period, lead was used increasingly for  |adulterating|Adulteration|  wine. The use of such wine was forbidden for use in Christian rites by a  |papal_bull|Papal_Bull|  in 1498, but it continued to be imbibed and resulted in mass poisonings up to the late 18th century. Lead was a key material in parts of the  |printing_press|Printing_Press| , which was invented around 1440; lead dust was commonly inhaled by print workers, causing lead poisoning. Firearms were invented at around the same time, and lead, despite being more expensive than iron, became the chief material for making bullets. It was less damaging to iron gun barrels, had a higher density , and its lower melting point made the production of bullets easier as they could be made using a wood fire. Lead, in the form of  |Venetian_ceruse|Venetian_Ceruse| , was extensively used in cosmetics by Western European aristocracy as whitened faces were regarded as a sign of modesty. This practice later expanded to white wigs and eyeliners, and only faded out with the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  in the late 18th century. A similar fashion appeared in Japan in the 18th century with the emergence of the  |geishas|Geisha| , a practice that continued long into the 20th century. The white faces of women came to represent their feminine virtue as Japanese women , with lead commonly used in the whitener.       In the  |New_World|New_World| , lead production was recorded soon after the arrival of European settlers. The earliest record dates to 1621 in the English  |Colony_of_Virginia|Colony_Of_Virginia| , fourteen years after its foundation. In Australia, the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine, in 1841. In Africa, lead mining and smelting were known in the  |Benue_Trough|Benue_Trough|  and the lower  |Congo_Basin|Congo_Basin| , where lead was used for trade with Europeans, and as a currency by the 17th century, well before the  |scramble_for_Africa|Scramble_For_Africa| .                 In the second half of the 18th century, Britain, and later continental Europe and the United States, experienced the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| . This was the first time during which lead production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting— |lead_paints|Lead_Paint|  were in regular use. At this time, more people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and  |gout|Gout|  were linked; British physician  |Alfred_Baring_Garrod|Alfred_Baring_Garrod|  noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.            Further evidence of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mechanisms of harm were better understood, lead blindness was documented, and the element was phased out of public use in the United States and Europe. The United Kingdom introduced mandatory factory inspections in 1878 and appointed the first Medical Inspector of Factories in 1898; as a result, a 25-fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from 1900 to 1944 was reported. Most European countries banned lead paint—commonly used because of its opacity and water resistance—for interiors by 1930.     The last major human exposure to lead was the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline as an  |antiknock_agent|Antiknock_Agent| , a practice that originated in the United States in 1921.  It was phased out in the United States and the  |European_Union|European_Union|  by 2000.     In the 1970s, the United States and Western European countries introduced legislation to reduce lead air pollution. The impact was significant: while a study conducted by the  |Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention|Centers_For_Disease_Control_And_Prevention|  in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of the population had elevated  |blood_lead_levels|Blood_Lead_Level| , in 1991–1994, a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%. The main product made of lead by the end of the 20th century was the  |lead–acid_battery|Lead–Acid_Battery| ,.     From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the  |Western_Bloc|Western_Bloc|  grew by about 31%. The share of the worlds lead production by the  |Eastern_Bloc|Eastern_Bloc|  increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the  |Soviet_Union|Soviet_Union|  being the worlds largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead production in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.            As of 2014, production of lead is increasing worldwide due to its use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58  million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64  million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and India. According to the  |International_Resource_Panels|International_Resource_Panel| |Metal_Stocks_in_Society_report|Metal_Stocks_In_Society_Report|  of 2010, the total amount of lead in use, stockpiled, discarded, or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8  kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries rather than less developed ones .     The primary and secondary lead production processes are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and this trend is likely to increase in the future. Given adequate techniques, lead obtained via secondary processes is indistinguishable from lead obtained via primary processes. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.              Most lead ores contain a low percentage of lead which must be concentrated for extraction. During initial processing, ores typically undergo crushing,  |dense-medium_separation|Dense-Medium_Separation| ,  |grinding|Grinding| ,  |froth_flotation|Froth_Flotation| , and drying. The resulting concentrate, which has a lead content of 30–80% by mass , is then turned into lead metal.     There are two main ways of doing this: a two-stage process involving roasting followed by blast furnace extraction, carried out in separate vessels; or a direct process in which the extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single vessel. The latter has become the most common route, though the former is still significant.                First, the sulfide concentrate is  |roasted|Roasting|  in air to oxidize the lead sulfide:     : 2  PbS + 3  O 2 → 2  PbO + 2  SO 2 ↑     As the original concentrate was not pure lead sulfide, roasting yields not only the desired lead oxide, but a mixture of oxides, sulfates, and silicates of lead and of the other metals contained in the ore. This impure lead oxide is reduced in a  |coke|Coke| -fired blast furnace to the metal:     : 2  PbO + C → 2  Pb + CO 2 ↑     Impurities are mostly arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and gold. Typically they are removed in a series of  |pyrometallurgical_processes|Pyrometallurgy| . The melt is treated in a  |reverberatory_furnace|Reverberatory_Furnace|  with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the impurities except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float to the  |top_of_the_melt|Dross|  and are skimmed off. Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the  |Parkes_process|Parkes_Process| , in which zinc is added to lead. Zinc, which is immiscible in lead, dissolves the silver and gold. The zinc solution can be separated from the lead, and the silver and gold retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the  |Betterton–Kroll_process|Betterton–Kroll_Process| , treating it with metallic calcium and  |magnesium|Magnesium| . The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.     Alternatively to the pyrometallurgical processes, very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the  |Betts_process|Betts_Electrolytic_Process| . Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead  |fluorosilicate|Fluorosilicate|  . Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution. This is a high-cost process and thus mostly reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities.       In this process, lead bullion and  |slag|Slag|  is obtained directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide. Carbon  is added to the molten charge along with  |fluxing_agents|Flux| . The lead monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic lead, in the midst of a slag rich in lead monoxide.     If the input is rich in lead, as much as 80% of the original lead can be obtained as bullion; the remaining 20% forms a slag rich in lead monoxide. For a low-grade feed, all of the lead can be oxidized to a high-lead slag. Metallic lead is further obtained from the high-lead slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection, reduction assisted by an electric furnace, or a combination of both.         Research on a cleaner, less energy-intensive lead extraction process continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives result in a high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal.  |Hydrometallurgical|Hydrometallurgy|  extraction, in which  |anodes|Anode|  of impure lead are immersed into an  |electrolyte|Electrolyte|  and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential, but is not currently economical except in cases where electricity is very cheap.         Smelting, which is an essential part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead has undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a  |blast_furnace|Blast_Furnace|  or a  |rotary_furnace|Rotary_Furnace| , with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields: blast furnaces produce hard lead while reverberatory and rotary kiln furnaces produced semisoft lead . The  |Isasmelt_process|Isasmelt|  is a more recent smelting method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has its sulfate removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination.     Of the sources of lead for recycling, lead–acid batteries are the most important; lead pipe, sheet, and cable sheathing are also significant.              Contrary to popular belief, pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead. When the pencil originated as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the particular type of  |graphite|Graphite|  used was named  |plumbago|Plumbago_Plumbago|  .       Lead metal has several useful mechanical properties, including high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness. Many metals are superior to lead in some of these aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores. Leads toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses.     Lead has been used for  |bullets|Bullet|  since their invention in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than other common metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. It remains the main material for bullets, alloyed with other metals as hardeners. Concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment.     Leads high density and resistance to corrosion have been exploited in a number of related applications. It is used as  |ballast|Ballast|  in sailboat keels; its density allows it to take up a small volume and minimize water resistance, thus counterbalancing the heeling effect of wind on the sails. It is used in  |scuba_diving|Scuba_Diving| |weight_belts|Diving_Weighting_System|  to counteract the divers buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the  |Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa|Leaning_Tower_Of_Pisa|  was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.        Lead has many uses in the construction industry; lead sheets are used as  |architectural_metals|Architectural_Metals|  in roofing material,  |cladding|Cladding| ,  |flashing|Flashing| ,  |gutters|Rain_Gutter|  and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for  |armatures|Armature| . In the past it was often used to  |balance_the_wheels_of_cars|Tire_Balance| ; for environmental reasons this use is being phased out in favor of other materials.     Lead is added to copper alloys, such as  |brass|Brass|  and bronze, to improve  |machinability|Machinability|  and for its  |lubricating|Lubricant|  qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as  |grain_boundaries|Grain_Boundaries| . In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of  |swarf|Swarf|  as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in  |bearings|Bearing| . The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.     Leads high density, atomic number, and formability form the basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios.  |Organ_pipes|Organ_Pipe|  are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established  |shielding|Lead_Shielding|  material from  |radiation|Ionizing_Radiation|  in  |nuclear_science|Nuclear_Science|  and in  |X-ray|X-Ray|  rooms due to its denseness and high  |attenuation_coefficient|Attenuation_Coefficient| . Molten lead has been used as a  |coolant|Coolant|  for  |lead-cooled_fast_reactors|Lead-Cooled_Fast_Reactor| .     The largest use of lead in the early 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. People who work in battery production plants may be exposed to lead dust and inhale it.ssaqsl2500  mg4000  mg |emist|Emist| 1%whether inhaled or swallowed |ochemist|Ochemist| |st|St| including that of neurotransmitters |EDTA|Edta| i.e., concentration of the naturally occurring lead |ll|Ll| N,N-diisobutyl |dithiocarbamate|Dithiocarbamate| |rthern_Fran|Rthern_Fran| such as that used for tubing and the insulation of electrical cords |inti|Inti| in order to facilitate lead abatement activities.
