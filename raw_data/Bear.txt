                 Bears are  |carnivora|Carnivora| n  |mammals|Mammal|  of the  |family|Family|  Ursidae. They are classified as  |caniforms|Caniforms| , or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight  |species|Species|  of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of  |habitats|Habitat|  throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair,  |plantigrade|Plantigrade|  paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.     While the  |polar_bear|Polar_Bear|  is mostly  |carnivorous|Carnivorous| , and the  |giant_panda|Giant_Panda|  feeds almost entirely on  |bamboo|Bamboo| , the remaining six species are  |omnivorous|Omnivorous|  with varied diets. With the exception of  |courting|Courting|  individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically  |solitary_animals|Solitary_Animals| . They may be  |diurnal|Diurnality|  or  |nocturnal|Nocturnal|  and have an excellent  |sense_of_smell|Sense_Of_Smell| . Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of  |hibernation|Hibernation| , up to 100 days.     Bears have been hunted since  |prehistoric|Prehistoric|  times for  |their_meat|Bear_Meat|  and fur; they have been used for  |bear-baiting|Bear-Baiting|  and other forms of entertainment, such as being  |made_to_dance|Tame_Bear| . With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in  |the_arts|The_Arts| ,  |mythology|Mythology| , and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian  |bile_bear|Bile_Bear|  market. The  |IUCN|Iucn|  lists six bear species as  |vulnerable|Vulnerable_Species|  or  |endangered|Endangered_Species| , and even  |least_concern|Least_Concern|  species, such as the  |brown_bear|Brown_Bear| , are at risk of  |extirpation|Extirpation|  in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.       The English word bear comes from  |Old_English|Old_English|   and belongs to a family of names for the bear in  |Germanic_languages|Germanic_Languages| , such as Swedish , also used as a first name. This form is conventionally said to be related to a  |Proto-Indo-European|Proto-Indo-European|  word for brown , so that bear would mean the brown one .   However,  |Ringe|Donald_Ringe|  notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible, a word meaning brown of this form cannot be found in Proto-Indo-European. He suggests instead that bear is from the Proto-Indo-European word ǵʰwḗr- ~ ǵʰwér wild animal .  This terminology for the animal originated as a  |taboo_avoidance|Avoidance_Speech|  term: proto-Germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear—arkto—with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animals true name might cause it to appear.    According to author  |Ralph_Keyes|Ralph_Keyes| , this is the oldest known  |euphemism|Euphemism| .      Bear taxon names such as  |Arctoidea|Arctoidea|  and  Helarctos  come from the ancient Greek word ἄρκτος , meaning bear,  as do the names  |arctic|Arctic|  and  |antarctic|Antarctic|  , from the  |constellation|Constellation| |Ursa_Major|Ursa_Major| , the Great Bear , prominent in the northern sky.      Bear taxon names such as Ursidae and Ursus come from Latin Ursus/Ursa, he-bear/she-bear. The female first name Ursula , originally derived from a Christian  |saints|St._Ursula|  name, means little she-bear . In Switzerland, the male first name Urs is especially popular, while the name of the canton and city of  |Bern|Bern|  is derived from Bär, German for bear. The Germanic name  |Bernard|Bernard|  means bear-brave , bear-hardy , or bold bear .   The Old English name  |Beowulf|Beowulf|  is a  |kenning|Kenning| , bee-wolf , for bear, in turn meaning a brave warrior. Sweet, Henry . The Clarendon Press, p. 202.          The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder  |Caniformia|Caniformia| , or doglike carnivorans, within the  |order|Order| |Carnivora|Carnivora| . Bears closest living relatives are the  |pinnipeds|Pinniped| ,  |canids|Canidae| , and  |musteloids|Musteloidea| .  Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies:  |Ailuropodinae|Ailuropodinae|  ,  |Tremarctinae|Tremarctinae|  , and  |Ursinae|Ursinae|  . Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the  |karyotype|Karyotype|  of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74   |chromosomes|Chromosome|  , whereas the giant panda has 42  chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in  |Procyonidae|Procyonidae| , where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.             The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including  Parictis   and the slightly younger Allocyon , both from North America. These animals looked very different from todays bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. Parictis does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene.  It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the  |Bering_land_bridge|Bering_Land_Bridge|  may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene and continuing into the early Oligocene.  European genera morphologically very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American  Kolponomos  ,  are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps and  Amphicynodon . There has been various morphological evidence linking amphicynodontines with  |pinnipeds|Pinniped| , as both groups were semi-aquatic, otter-like mammals.    In addition to the support of the pinniped–amphicynodontine clade, other morphological and some molecular evidence supports bears being the closet living relatives to pinnipeds.          The raccoon-sized, dog-like  Cephalogale  is the oldest-known member of the subfamily  |Hemicyoninae|Hemicyoninae| , which first appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30  Mya. The subfamily includes the younger genera  Phoberocyon  , and  Plithocyon  . A Cephalogale-like species gave rise to the genus  Ursavus  during the early Oligocene ; this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears. Species of Ursavus subsequently entered North America, together with Amphicynodon and Cephalogale, during the early Miocene . Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from Ursavus between 15 and 20  Mya,   likely via the species Ursavus elmensis. Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19  Mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5 Mya.      The New World short-faced bears differentiated from Ursinae following a dispersal event into North America during the mid-Miocene . They  |invaded_South_America|Great_American_Interchange|  following formation of the  |Isthmus_of_Panama|Isthmus_Of_Panama| .  Their earliest fossil representative is  Plionarctos  in North America . This genus is probably the direct ancestor to the  |North_American_short-faced_bears|Short-Faced_Bear|  , the  |South_American_short-faced_bears|Arctotherium|  , and the spectacled bears, Tremarctos, represented by both an extinct North American species , and the lone surviving representative of the Tremarctinae, the South American spectacled bear .        The subfamily Ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5  Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus  Ursus  appeared around this time. The  |sloth_bear|Sloth_Bear|  is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event ; it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4  Mya, the species Ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to todays  |Asian_black_bear|Asian_Black_Bear| . It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from U.  minimus; and the brown bears . Modern  |brown_bears|Brown_Bear|  evolved from U.  minimus via  Ursus etruscus , which itself is ancestral to the extinct  |Pleistocene|Pleistocene| |cave_bear|Cave_Bear| . Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene.  Ward and Kynaston, pp.  74–77 The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation 400,000  years ago.        The bears form a  |clade|Clade|  within the Carnivora. The  |cladogram|Cladogram|  is based on  |molecular_phylogeny|Molecular_Phylogeny|  of six genes in Flynn, 2005.         Note that although they are called bears in some languages,  |red_pandas|Red_Panda|  and  |raccoons_and_their_close_relatives|Procyonidae|  are not bears, but rather  |musteloids|Musteloidea| .     There are two phylogenetic hypotheses on the relationships among extant and fossil bear species. One is all species of bears are classified in seven subfamilies as adopted here and related articles:  |Amphicynodontinae|Amphicynodontinae| ,  |Hemicyoninae|Hemicyoninae| ,  |Ursavinae|Ursavinae| ,  |Agriotheriinae|Agriotheriinae| ,  |Ailuropodinae|Ailuropodinae| ,  |Tremarctinae|Tremarctinae| , and  |Ursinae|Ursinae| .     Below is a cladogram of the subfamilies of bears after McLellan and Reiner and Qiu et al. :        The second alternative phylogenetic hypothesis was implemented by McKenna et al. is to classify all the bear species into the superfamily Ursoidea, with Hemicyoninae and Agriotheriinae being classified in the family Hemicyonidae .  Amphicynodontinae under this classification were classified as stem- |pinnipeds|Pinnipeds|  in the superfamily  |Phocoidea|Pinnipedia| . In the McKenna and Bell classification both bears and pinnipeds in a parvorder of  |carnivora|Carnivora| n mammals known as  |Ursida|Ursida| , along with the extinct bear dogs of the family  |Amphicyonidae|Amphicyonidae| . Below is the cladogram based on McKenna and Bell classification:        The  |phylogeny|Phylogenetic_Tree|  of extant bear species is shown in a cladogram based on complete  |mitochondrial_DNA|Mitochondrial_Dna|  sequences from Yu et al.    The giant panda, followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. The relationships of the other species are not very well resolved, though the polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping.                 The bear family includes the most massive extant terrestrial members of the order Carnivora. The polar bear is considered to be the largest extant species, Ward and Kynaston, p. 61 with adult males weighing  and measuring  in total length.  The smallest species is the sun bear, which ranges  in weight and  in length.  Prehistoric  |North|Short-Faced_Bear|  and  |South_American_short-faced_bears|South_American_Short-Faced_Bear|  were the largest species known to have lived. The latter estimated to have weighed  and stood  tall.   Body weight varies throughout the year in bears of temperate and arctic climates, as they build up fat reserves in the summer and autumn and lose weight during the winter.            Bears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are  |sexually_dimorphic|Sexual_Dimorphism|  with regard to size, with males typically being larger.   Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The  |shoulder_blades|Scapula|  and the  |pelvis|Pelvis|  are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the  |big_cats|Big_Cat|  as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.        Unlike most other land carnivorans, bears are  |plantigrade|Plantigrade| . They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping  |bamboo|Bamboo|  shoots as the animals feed.     Most mammals have  |agouti|Agouti|  hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to two different types of  |melanin|Melanin|  pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.     Bears have small rounded ears so as to minimise heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have  |colour_vision|Colour_Vision| , perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive  |whiskers|Whiskers|  on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent  |sense_of_smell|Olfaction| , better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.        The  |skulls|Skull|  of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful  |masseter|Masseter_Muscle|  and  |temporal|Temporal_Muscle|  jaw muscles. The  |canine_teeth|Canine_Tooth|  are large but mostly used for display, and the  |molar|Molar|  teeth flat and crushing. Unlike most other members of the Carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped  |carnassial|Carnassial|  teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter.  Considerable variation occurs in  |dental_formula|Dentition|  even within a given species. This may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from a mainly meat-eating diet to a predominantly herbivorous one. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved carnassial-like cheek teeth, as their diets have switched back towards carnivory.  Sloth bears lack lower central incisors and use their protusible lips for sucking up the termites on which they feed. The general dental formula for living bears is:   . The structure of the  |larynx|Larynx|  of bears appears to be the most  |basal|Basal|  of the caniforms. They possess air pouches connected to the  |pharynx|Pharynx|  which may  |amplify|Vocal_Resonance|  their vocalisations.      Bears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no  |cecum|Cecum| .  Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest  |cellulose|Cellulose|  is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.  Bears must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.               Extant bears are found in sixty countries primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the  |Andean_region|Andes| . The sun bears range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia. Ward and Kynaston, p.52 The  |Atlas_bear|Atlas_Bear| , a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.      The most widespread species is the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia to the western areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian.  They occur in a range of habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra and in the case of the polar bear,  |ice_floes|Drift_Ice| . Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.            Brown and American black bears are generally  |diurnal|Diurnality| , meaning that they are active for the most part during the day, though they may forage substantially by night.  Other species may be  |nocturnal|Nocturnal| , active at night, though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators. Ward and Kynaston, 99 Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the Carnivora. The only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food .  Fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive  |scar|Scar| ring, which suggests that maintaining  |dominance|Dominance|  can be intense. Ward and Kynaston, p. 130 With their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away. They use  |olfaction|Olfaction|  to locate other foods, encounter mates, avoid rivals and recognise their cubs.            Most bears are opportunistic  |omnivores|Omnivore|  and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and  |berries|Berries|  to  |insects|Insect| ,  |carrion|Carrion| , fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. Ward and Kynaston, p. 83 For example, Asiatic black bears in  |Taiwan|Taiwan|  consume large numbers of  |acorns|Acorn|  when these are most common, and switch to  |ungulates|Ungulate|  at other times of the year.      When foraging for plants, bears choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older  |grass|Grass| es,  |sedges|Sedge|  and leaves.  Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally  |fermented|Fermentation|  fruits, which affects their behaviour.  Smaller bears climb trees to obtain  |mast|Mast|  .  Such masts can be very important to the diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources.  Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The pandas diet is over 99% bamboo,  of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Ward and Kynaston, pp. 89–92   |Bromeliads|Bromeliad|  can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open. Ward and Kynaston, p. 87        The sloth bear, though not as specialised as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the  |ants|Ant| ,  |termites|Termite| , and other burrowing insects they favour. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets.  Some species may raid the nests of  |wasps|Wasp|  and  |bees|Bee|  for the  |honey|Honey|  and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults.  Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Ward and Kynaston, p. 89 Fish are an important source of food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at  |salmon_runs|Salmon_Run| . Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like  |rodents|Rodent|  may be dug out and eaten.        The brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates, such as  |deer|Deer|  and  |bovids|Bovid| , mostly the young and weak.  Ward and Kynaston, pp. 93–98 These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on.   The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Ward and Kynaston, p. 92 Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or simply pinned down and mauled.  Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.     Bears are prolific  |scavengers|Scavenger|  and  |kleptoparasites|Kleptoparasite| , stealing food  |caches|Hoarding|  from rodents, and carcasses from other predators.  For hibernating species, weight gain is important as it provides nourishment during winter dormancy. A brown bear can eat  of food and gain  of fat a day prior to entering its den. Ward and Kynaston, p. 104            Bears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animals position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing. Ward and Kynaston, pp. 117–121             Bears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as  |standing_upright|Bipedalism| , which exaggerates the individuals size. The chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display. Staring is an aggressive act and the facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to the eyes during  |agonistic|Agonistic_Behavior|  encounters. Ward and Kynaston, pp. 124–125 Individuals may approach each other by stiff-legged walking with the head lowered. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing the  |canine_teeth|Canine_Teeth| , muzzle twisting and neck stretching. A subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down.       Bears may mark territory by rubbing against trees and other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around to draw attention to the marking post. Ward and Kynaston, p. 122 Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands.  Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.           The mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of  |polygyny|Polygyny_In_Animals| ,  |promiscuity|Promiscuity|  and  |serial_monogamy|Serial_Monogamy| .   During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising.  |Ovulation_is_induced_by_mating|Induced_Ovulation| , which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species. Ward and Kynaston, pp. 138–141         |Gestation|Gestation|  typically lasts 6–9 months, including  |delayed_implantation|Delayed_Implantation| , and litter size numbers up to four cubs. Giant pandas may give birth to twins but they can only suckle one young and the other is left to die.  In northern living species, birth takes place during winter dormancy. Cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair, relying on their mother for warmth. The milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born. By 2–3 months, cubs can follow their mother outside the den. They usually follow her on foot, but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mothers back. Ward and Kynaston, pp. 144–148  Male bears play no role in raising young.  |Infanticide|Infanticide| , where an adult male kills the cubs of another, has been recorded in polar bears, brown bears and American black bears but not in other species. Ward and Kynaston, p. 132 Males kill young to bring the female into  |oestrus|Oestrus| .  Cubs may flee and the mother defends them even at the cost of her life.        In some species, offspring may become independent around the next spring, through some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach  |sexual_maturity|Sexual_Maturity|  shortly after they disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.           Bears of northern regions, including the  |American_black_bear|American_Black_Bearhibernation|  and the  |grizzly_bear|Grizzly_Bearhibernation| , hibernate in the winter.   During hibernation, the bears metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute.  Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A  |fecal_plug|Fecal_Plug|  is formed in the colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring.  If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste  |urea|Urea| . Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.            Bears do not have many predators. The most important are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease.   |Felids|Felid|  like the  |tiger|Tiger|  may also prey on bears,   particularly cubs, which may also be threatened by canids.     Bears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites, including single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan  Sarcocystis , the parasitic worm  Diphyllobothrium mansonoides , and the nematodes  Dirofilaria immitis ,  Capillaria aerophila ,  Physaloptera  sp.,  Strongyloides  sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms.  By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bears life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan  Toxoplasma gondii  has been found in polar bears, and the nematode  Trichinella nativa  can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears.  Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a  Morbillivirus  similar to the  |canine_distemper_virus|Canine_Distemper| .  They are susceptible to  |infectious_canine_hepatitis|Infectious_Canine_Hepatitis|  , with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.                In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats  and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian  |bile_bear|Bile_Bear|  market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming.  The  |IUCN|World_Conservation_Union|  lists six bear species as  |vulnerable|Vulnerable_Species| ;  even the two  |least_concern|Least_Concern|  species, the brown bear and the American black bear, are at risk of  |extirpation|Local_Extinction|  in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.      Laws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from  |habitat_destruction|Habitat_Destruction| . Public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance.  Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies.  The giant panda has become a worldwide symbol of conservation. The  |Sichuan_Giant_Panda_Sanctuaries|Sichuan_Giant_Panda_Sanctuaries| , which are home to around 30% of the wild panda population, gained a  |UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site|Unesco_World_Heritage_Site|  designation in 2006.  Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans.   In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears, and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.            Several bear species are  |dangerous_to_humans|Bear_Danger| , especially in areas where they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans.  |Injuries_caused_by_bears|Bear_Attack|  are rare, but are widely reported.  Bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.             Bears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment. They have been trained to  |dance|Dancing_Bear| ,  and were kept for  |baiting|Bear-Baiting|  in Europe at least since the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in  |Southwark|Southwark| , London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived.  Across Europe,  |nomad|Nomad| ic  |Romani|Romani_People|  bear handlers called  |Ursari|Ursari|  lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.          |Bears_have_been_hunted|Bear_Hunting|  for sport, food, and  |folk_medicine|Folk_Medicine| . Their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In  |Cantonese_cuisine|Cantonese_Cuisine| , bear paws are considered a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, as it can be infected with the parasite  Trichinella spiralis .       The peoples of eastern Asia use bears body parts and secretions as part of  |traditional_Chinese_medicine|Traditional_Chinese_Medicine| . More than 12,000 bears are thought to be kept on farms in China, Vietnam, and South Korea for the production of bile. Trade in bear products is prohibited under  |CITES|Cites| , but bear bile has been detected in shampoos, wine and herbal medicines sold in Canada, the United States and Australia.              There is evidence of prehistoric  |bear_worship|Bear_Worship| , though this is disputed by archaeologists.  It is possible that bear worship existed in early Chinese and  |Ainu_cultures|Ainu_Religion| .  The prehistoric  |Finns|Finns| ,   |Siberian_peoples|Siberian_Peoples|   and more recently  |Koreans|Korean_Mythology|  considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers.  In many  |Native_American|Indigenous_Peoples_Of_The_Americas|  cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence. Ward and Kynaston, p. 17 The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the females devotion and protection of her cubs. Ward and Kynaston, pp. 12–13  |Japanese_folklore|Japanese_Folklore|  features the  |Onikuma|Onikuma| , a demon bear that walks upright.  The  |Ainu|Ainu_People|  of northern Japan, a different people from the Japanese, saw the bear instead as sacred; Hirasawa Byozan painted a scene in documentary style of a  |bear_sacrifice|Iomante|  in an Ainu temple, complete with offerings to the dead animals spirit.      In  |Korea|Korea| n mythology, a  |tiger|Siberian_Tiger|  and a bear prayed to  |Hwanung|Hwanung| , the son of the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of  |mugwort|Mugwort| , ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.  The bear-woman  was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. However, she lacked a husband, and soon became sad and prayed beneath a divine  |birch|Birch|  tree  to be blessed with a child. Hwanung, moved by her prayers, took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named  |Dangun_Wanggeom|Dangun_Wanggeom|  – who was the legendary founder of  |Gojoseon|Gojoseon| , the first ever  |Korea|Korea| n kingdom.          |Artio|Artio|   was a  |Celtic|Celts|  bear goddess. Evidence of her worship has notably been found at  |Bern|Bern| , itself named for the bear. Her name is derived from the Celtic word for bear , artos.  In ancient Greece, archaic cult of  |Artemis|Artemis|  in bear form survived into Classical times at  |Brauron|Brauron| , where young Athenian girls passed an initiation right as arktai she bears . Burkert, Walter, Greek Religion, 1985:263. For Artemis and one of her  |nymphs|Nymph|  as a she-bear, see the myth of  |Callisto|Callisto| .     The constellations of Ursa Major and  |Ursa_Minor|Ursa_Minor| , the great and little bears, are named for their supposed resemblance to bears, from the time of  |Ptolemy|Ptolemy| . The nearby star  |Arcturus|Arcturus|  means guardian of the bear , as if it were watching the two constellations.  Ursa Major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since  |Paleolithic|Paleolithic|  times, in the widespread  |Cosmic_Hunt|Cosmic_Hunt|  myths. These are found on both sides of the  |Bering_land_bridge|Beringia| , which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago.  reviewed at        |Pliny_the_Elders|Pliny_The_Elder|   Natural History  claims that when first born, are shapeless masses of white flesh, a little larger than mice; their claws alone being prominent. The mother then licks them gradually into proper shape.  This belief was echoed by authors of  |bestiaries|Bestiary|  throughout the medieval period.       Bears are mentioned in the  |Bible|Bible| ; the  |Second_Book_of_Kings|Second_Book_Of_Kings|  relates the story of the prophet  |Elisha|Elisha|  calling on them to eat the youths who taunted him.  |Second_Book_of_Kings|Second_Book_Of_Kings| , 2:23–25 Legends of  |saints|Saint|  taming bears are common in the Alpine zone. In the arms of the bishopric of  |Freising|Freising| , the bear is the dangerous totem animal tamed by St.  |Corbinian|Corbinian|  and made to carry his civilised baggage over the mountains. Bears similarly feature in the legends of St.  |Romedius|Romedius| ,  |Saint_Gall|Saint_Gall|  and  |Saint_Columbanus|Saint_Columbanus| . This recurrent motif was used by the Church as a symbol of the victory of Christianity over paganism.  In the Norse settlements of northern England during the 10th century, a type of hogback grave cover of a long narrow block of stone, with a shaped apex like the roof beam of a long house, is carved with a muzzled, thus Christianised, bear clasping each gable end, as in the church at  |Brompton,_North_Yorkshire|Brompton,_Hambleton|  and across the  |British_Isles|British_Isles| .          |Lāčplēsis|Lāčplēsis| , meaning Bear-slayer , is a  |Latvia|Latvia| n legendary hero who is said to have killed a bear by ripping its jaws apart with his bare hands. However, as revealed in the end of the long epic describing his life, Lāčplēsis own mother had been a she-bear, and his superhuman strength resided in his bear ears. The modern Latvian military award  |Order_of_Lāčplēsis|Order_Of_Lāčplēsis| , called for the hero, is also known as The Order of the Bear-Slayer.     Bears are popular in childrens stories, including  |Winnie_the_Pooh|Winnie_The_Pooh| ,   |Paddington_Bear|Paddington_Bear| ,   |Gentle_Ben|Gentle_Ben|   and  |The_Brown_Bear_of_Norway|The_Brown_Bear_Of_Norway|  .  An early version of  |Goldilocks_and_the_Three_Bears|Goldilocks_And_The_Three_Bears|  ,  was published as The Three Bears in 1837 by  |Robert_Southey|Robert_Southey| , many times retold, and illustrated in 1918 by  |Arthur_Rackham|Arthur_Rackham| .  The  |Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera|  character  |Yogi_Bear|Yogi_Bear|  has appeared in numerous comic books,  |animated_television_shows|Cartoon_Series|  and films.   The  |Care_Bears|Care_Bears|  began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film.  Around the world, many children—and some adults—have  |teddy_bears|Teddy_Bear| ,  |stuffed_toys|Stuffed_Toy|  in the form of bears, named after the American statesman  |Theodore_Roosevelt|Theodore_Roosevelt|  when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an American black bear tied to a tree.      Bears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. In 1911, the British satirical magazine  |Punch|Punch_Magazine|  published a cartoon about the  |Anglo-Russian_Entente|Anglo-Russian_Entente|  by  |Leonard_Raven-Hill|Leonard_Raven-Hill|  in which the British  |lion|Lion|  watches as the Russian bear sits on the tail of the  |Persia|Persia| n cat.  The  |Russian_Bear|Russian_Bear|  has been a common  |national_personification|National_Personification|  for Russia from the 16th century onward.   |Smokey_Bear|Smokey_Bear|  has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message Only you can prevent forest fires .  In the United Kingdom, the bear and staff feature on the heraldic arms of the county of  |Warwickshire|Warwickshire| .  Bears appear in the  |canting_arms|Canting_Arms|  of two cities, Bern and Berlin.             The International Association for Bear Research & Management, also known as the  |International_Bear_Association|International_Bear_Association| , and the  |Bear_Specialist_Group|Bear_Specialist_Group|  of the Species Survival Commission, a part of the  |International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature|International_Union_For_Conservation_Of_Nature|  focus on the natural history, management, and conservation of bears. Bear Trust International works for wild bears and other wildlife through four core program initiatives, namely Conservation Education, Wild Bear Research, Wild Bear Management, and Habitat Conservation.      Specialty organizations for each of the eight species of bears worldwide include:   Vital Ground, for the brown bear    Moon Bears, for the Asiatic black bear    Black Bear Conservation Coalition, for the North American black bear    Polar Bears International, for the polar bear    Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, for the sun bear    Wildlife SOS, for the sloth bear    Andean Bear Conservation Project, for the Andean bear    Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, for the giant panda .
