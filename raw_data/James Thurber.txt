        James Grover Thurber was an American  |cartoonist|Cartoonist| , author,  |humorist|Humorist| , journalist, playwright, childrens book author, and celebrated  |wit|Wit| . He was best known for his  |cartoons|Gag_Cartoon|  and short stories published mainly in  The New Yorker  magazine, such as  |The_Catbird_Seat|The_Catbird_Seat|  , and collected in his numerous books. He was one of the most popular humorists of his time, as he celebrated the comic frustrations and eccentricities of ordinary people. He wrote the Broadway comedy  The Male Animal  in collaboration with his college friend  |Elliott_Nugent|Elliott_Nugent| ; it was later adapted into a film starring  |Henry_Fonda|Henry_Fonda|  and  |Olivia_de_Havilland|Olivia_De_Havilland| . His short story  |The_Secret_Life_of_Walter_Mitty|The_Secret_Life_Of_Walter_Mitty|  has been adapted for film twice, once  |in_1947|The_Secret_Life_Of_Walter_Mitty|  and again  |in_2013|The_Secret_Life_Of_Walter_Mitty| .       Thurber was born in  |Columbus,_Ohio|Columbus,_Ohio| , to Charles L. Thurber and Mary Agnes Mame Thurber on December 8, 1894. Both of his parents greatly influenced his work. His father was a sporadically employed clerk and minor politician who dreamed of being a lawyer or an actor. Thurber described his mother as a born comedian and one of the finest comic talents I think I have ever known. She was a practical joker and, on one occasion, pretended to be crippled and attended a faith healer revival, only to jump up and proclaim herself healed.         When Thurber was seven years old, he and one of his brothers were playing a  |game_of_William_Tell|Shooting_An_Apple_Off_Ones_Childs_Headwilliam_Tell| , when his brother shot James in the eye with an arrow.  He lost that eye, and the injury later caused him to become almost entirely blind. He was unable to participate in sports and other activities in his childhood because of this injury, but he developed a creative mind which he used to express himself in writings. Neurologist  |V_.S._Ramachandran|Vilayanur_S._Ramachandran|  suggests that Thurbers imagination may be partly explained by  |Charles_Bonnet_syndrome|Charles_Bonnet_Syndrome| , a neurological condition which causes complex visual hallucinations in people who have suffered some level of visual loss.            From 1913 to 1918, Thurber attended  |Ohio_State_University|Ohio_State_University|  where he was a member of the  |Phi_Kappa_Psi|Phi_Kappa_Psi|  fraternity. It was during this time he rented the house on 77 Jefferson Avenue, which became Thurber House in 1984. He never graduated from the university because his poor eyesight prevented him from taking a mandatory  |Reserve_Officers_Training_Corps|Reserve_Officers_Training_Corps|  course.  In 1995 he was posthumously awarded a degree.       From 1918 to 1920, Thurber worked as a code clerk for the  |United_States_Department_of_State|United_States_Department_Of_State| , first in Washington, D.C. and then at the  |embassy_in_Paris|Embassy_Of_The_United_States,_Paris| . On returning to Columbus, he began his career as a reporter for  The Columbus Dispatch  from 1921 to 1924. During part of this time, he reviewed books, films, and plays in a weekly column called Credos and Curios , a title that was given to a posthumous collection of his work. Thurber returned to Paris during this period, where he wrote for the  Chicago Tribune  and other newspapers.       In 1925, Thurber moved to  |Greenwich_Village|Greenwich_Village|  in New York City, getting a job as a reporter for the  New York Evening Post . He joined the staff of  The New Yorker  in 1927 as an editor, with the help of  |E.B._White|E.B._White| , his friend and fellow New Yorker contributor. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930 after White found some of Thurbers drawings in a trash can and submitted them for publication; White inked-in some of these earlier drawings to make them reproduce better for the magazine, and years later expressed deep regret that he had done such a thing. Thurber contributed both his writings and his drawings to The New Yorker until the 1950s.       Thurber married Althea Adams in 1922, but the marriage, as he later wrote to a friend, devolved into “a relationship charming, fine, and hurting.”  The marriage ended in divorce in May 1935. They lived in  |Fairfield_County,_Connecticut|Fairfield_County,_Connecticut| , with their daughter Rosemary . , The New York Times, 12 March 1975 He married Helen Wismer in June 1935.        Thurbers behavior became erratic and unpredictable in his last year. At a party hosted by  |Noël_Coward|Noël_Coward| , Thurber was taken back to the  |Algonquin_Hotel|Algonquin_Hotel|  at six in the morning. Thurber was stricken with a blood clot on the brain on October 4, 1961, and underwent emergency surgery, drifting in and out of consciousness. The operation was initially successful, but Thurber died a few weeks later, on November 2, aged 66, due to complications from pneumonia. The doctors said his brain was  |senescent|Senescence|  from several small strokes and hardening of the arteries. His last words, aside from the repeated word God , were God bless... God damn , according to his wife, Helen.        Established in 1997, the annual  |Thurber_Prize|Thurber_Prize_For_American_Humor|  honors outstanding examples of American humor.    In 2008,  |The_Library_of_America|The_Library_Of_America|  selected Thurbers story, A Sort of Genius, first published in The New Yorker, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.    Two of his residences have been listed on the U.S.  |National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National_Register_Of_Historic_Places| |Thurber_House|Thurber_House|  in Ohio and the  |Sanford-Curtis-Thurber_House|Sanford-Curtis-Thurber_House|  in  |Fairfield_County,_Connecticut|Fairfield_County,_Connecticut| .         Uniquely among major American literary figures, he became equally well known for his simple, surrealistic drawings and cartoons. Both his skills were helped along by the support of, and collaboration with, fellow New Yorker staff member  |E._B._White|E._B._White| , who insisted that Thurbers sketches could stand on their own as artistic expressions. Thurber drew six covers and numerous classic illustrations for The New Yorker.        The last twenty years of Thurbers life were filled with material and professional success in spite of his blindness. He published at least fourteen more books, including The Thurber Carnival , Thurber Country , and the extremely popular account of the life of New Yorker editor  |Harold_Ross|Harold_Ross| , The Years with Ross . A number of his short stories were made into movies, including  |The_Secret_Life_of_Walter_Mitty|The_Secret_Life_Of_Walter_Mitty|  . Many of his short stories are humorous fictional memoirs from his life, but he also wrote darker material, such as The Whip-Poor-Will , a story of madness and murder. His best-known short stories are The Dog That Bit People and ; they can be found in My Life and Hard Times, which was his break-out book. Among his other classics are  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty ,  The Catbird Seat ,  A Couple of Hamburgers , The Greatest Man in the World, If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox . The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze has several short stories with a tense undercurrent of marital discord. The book was published the year of his divorce and remarriage.   His 1941 story You Could Look It Up , ,  The Saturday Evening Post , April 5, 1941, pp. 9–11, 114, 116 about a three-foot adult being brought in to take a walk in a baseball game, is said to have inspired  |Bill_Veecks|Bill_Veeck|  stunt with  |Eddie_Gaedel|Eddie_Gaedel|  with the  |St._Louis_Browns|Saint_Louis_Browns|  in 1951. Veeck claimed an older provenance for the stunt, but was certainly aware of the Thurber story.      In addition to his other fiction, Thurber wrote over seventy-five  |fables|Fable| , some of which were first published in The New Yorker , then collected in  Fables for Our Time & Famous Poems Illustrated  and Further Fables for Our Time . These were short stories that featured anthropomorphic animals  as main characters, and ended with a moral as a tagline. An exception to this format was his most famous fable,  The Unicorn in the Garden , which featured an all-human cast except for the unicorn, which doesnt speak. Thurbers fables were  |satirical|Satire| , and the morals served as  |punchlines|Punch_Line|  as well as advice to the reader, demonstrating the complexity of life by depicting the world as an uncertain, precarious place, where few reliable guidelines exist. , by Ruth A. Maharg,  Childrens Literature Association Quarterly , Volume 9, Number 2, Summer 1984, pp. 72-73.     His stories also included several book-length fairy tales, such as  The White Deer  ,  The 13 Clocks  and  The Wonderful O  . The latter was one of several of Thurbers works illustrated by  |Marc_Simont|Marc_Simont| . Thurbers prose for The New Yorker and other venues included numerous humorous essays. A favorite subject, especially toward the end of his life, was the English language. Pieces on this subject included The Spreading You Know, which decried the overuse of that pair of words in conversation, The New Vocabularianism , What Do You Mean It Was Brillig? , and many others. His short pieces – whether stories, essays or something in between – were referred to as casuals by Thurber and the staff of The New Yorker.      Thurber wrote a biographical memoir about the founder/publisher of The New Yorker,  |Harold_Ross|Harold_Ross| , entitled The Years with Ross . He wrote a five-part New Yorker series, between 1947 and 1948, examining in depth the radio soap opera phenomenon, based on near-constant listening and researching over the same period. Leaving nearly no element of these programs unexamined, including their writers, producers, sponsors, performers, and listeners alike, Thurber republished the series in his anthology, The Beast in Me and Other Animals , under the section title Soapland. The series was one of the first to examine such a pop-culture phenomenon in depth.       While Thurber drew his cartoons in the usual fashion in the 1920s and 1930s, his failing eyesight later required changes. He drew them on very large sheets of paper using a thick black crayon . Regardless of method, his cartoons became as noted as his writings; they possessed an eerie, wobbly feel that seems to mirror his idiosyncratic view on life. He once wrote that people said it looked like he drew them under water.  |Dorothy_Parker|Dorothy_Parker| , a contemporary and friend of Thurber, referred to his cartoons as having the semblance of unbaked cookies . The last drawing Thurber completed was a self-portrait in yellow crayon on black paper, which was featured as the cover of  Time  magazine on July 9, 1951.  The same drawing was used for the dust jacket of The Thurber Album .       Thurber teamed with college schoolmate  |Elliott_Nugent|Elliott_Nugent|  to write  The Male Animal , a comic drama that became a major Broadway hit in 1939. The play was adapted as a film by the same name in 1942, starring  |Henry_Fonda|Henry_Fonda| ,  |Olivia_de_Havilland|Olivia_De_Havilland|  and  |Jack_Carson|Jack_Carson| .   In 1947 his short story  |The_Secret_Life_of_Walter_Mitty|The_Secret_Life_Of_Walter_Mitty|  , was loosely adapted as a  |film_by_the_same_name|The_Secret_Life_Of_Walter_Mitty| .  |Danny_Kaye|Danny_Kaye|  played the title character.   In 1951  |United_Productions_of_America|United_Productions_Of_America|  announced an animated feature to be based on Thurbers work, titled Men, Women and Dogs.  The only part of the ambitious project that was eventually released was the UPA cartoon  The Unicorn in the Garden  .    In 1960, Thurber fulfilled a long-standing desire to be on the professional stage and played himself in 88 performances of the revue  A Thurber Carnival  . It was based on a selection of Thurbers stories and cartoon captions. Thurber appeared in the sketch File and Forget . The sketch consists of Thurber dictating a series of letters in a vain attempt to keep one of his publishers from sending him books he did not order, and the escalating confusion of the replies.  Thurber won a special  |Tony_Award|Tony_Award|  for the adapted script of the Carnival.    In 1961, The Secret Life of James Thurber aired on  The DuPont Show with June Allyson .  |Adolphe_Menjou|Adolphe_Menjou|  appeared in the program as Fitch, and  |Orson_Bean|Orson_Bean|  and  |Sue_Randall|Sue_Randall|  portrayed John and Ellen Monroe.   In 1969-70, a full series based on Thurbers writings and life, titled  My World... and Welcome to It , was broadcast on  |NBC|Nbc| . It starred  |William_Windom|William_Windom|  as the Thurber figure. Featuring animated portions in addition to live actors, the show won a 1970  |Emmy_Award|Emmy_Award|  as the years best comedy series. Windom won an Emmy as well. He went on to perform Thurber material in a one-man stage show.   In 1972 another film adaptation,  The War Between Men and Women , starring  |Jack_Lemmon|Jack_Lemmon| , concludes with an animated version of Thurbers classic anti-war work The Last Flower .   In 2013, a new  |adaptation|The_Secret_Life_Of_Walter_Mitty|  of  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty , starring  |Ben_Stiller|Ben_Stiller|  as the title character.       Beginning during his own fathers terminal illness, television broadcaster  |Keith_Olbermann|Keith_Olbermann|  read excerpts from Thurbers short stories during the closing segment of his  |MSNBC|Msnbc|  program  Countdown with Keith Olbermann  on Fridays, which he called Fridays with Thurber.    On an episode of  |Norm_Macdonalds|Norm_Macdonald|  video podcast, Norm Macdonald Live, Norm tells a story in which comedian  |Larry_Miller|Larry_Miller|  acknowledges that his biggest influence in comedy was Thurber.
