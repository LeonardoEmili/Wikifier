                  Alfonso the Magnanimous   was the  |King_of_Aragon|King_Of_Aragon|  ,  |Valencia|King_Of_Valencia|  ,  |Majorca|Kingdom_Of_Majorca| ,  |Sardinia_and_Corsica|Kingdom_Of_Sardinia|  ,  |Sicily|Kingdom_Of_Sicily|   and  |Count_of_Barcelona|Count_Of_Barcelona|   from 1416, and  |King_of_Naples|King_Of_Naples|   from 1442 until his death. He was one of the most prominent figures of the early  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  On This Day:  and a knight of the  |Order_of_the_Dragon|Order_Of_The_Dragon| .       Born at  |Medina_del_Campo|Medina_Del_Campo| , he was the son of  |Ferdinand_I_of_Aragon|Ferdinand_I_Of_Aragon|  and  |Eleanor_of_Alburquerque|Eleanor_Of_Alburquerque| . He represented the old line of the counts of  |Barcelona|Barcelona|  through the female line, and was on his fathers side descended from the  |House_of_Trastamara|House_Of_Trastamara| , the reigning House of  |Castile|Castile| . By hereditary right he was king of  |Sicily|Sicily|  and claimed the island of  |Sardinia|Sardinia|  for himself, though it was then in the possession of  |Genoa|Genoa| . Alfonso was also in possession of much of  |Corsica|Corsica|  by the 1420s.        In 1421 the childless Queen  |Joanna_II_of_Naples|Joanna_Ii_Of_Naples|  adopted and named him as heir to the  |Kingdom_of_Naples|Kingdom_Of_Naples| , and Alfonso went to  |Naples|Naples| . Here he hired the  |condottiero|Condottiero| |_Braccio_da_Montone|Braccio_Da_Montone|  with the task of reducing the resistance of his rival claimant,  |Louis_III_of_Anjou|Louis_Iii_Of_Anjou| , and his forces led by  |Muzio_Attendolo|Muzio_Attendolo| |_Sforza|Sforza| . With Pope  |Martin_V|Martin_V|  supporting Sforza, Alfonso switched his religious allegiance to the Aragonese  |antipope_Benedict_XIII|Antipope_Benedict_Xiii| . When Sforza abandoned Louis cause, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover,  |Gianni_Caracciolo|Gianni_Caracciolo| , a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, arrested.     After an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed, Joan called on Sforza who defeated the Aragonese militias near  |Castel_Capuano|Castel_Capuano|  in Naples. Alfonso fled to  |Castel_Nuovo|Castel_Nuovo| , but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by  |Giovanni_da_Cardona|Giovanni_Da_Cardona|  improved his situation. Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of  |Aversa|Aversa| . Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with the backing of Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead.     The Duke of Milan,  |Filippo_Maria_Visconti|Filippo_Maria_Visconti| , joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joannas troops in  |LAquila|Laquila| , but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the  |Kingdom_of_Castile|Kingdom_Of_Castile| . On his way towards Barcelona, Alfonso sacked  |Marseille|Marseille| , a possession of Louis III.          In late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Filippo Maria Visconti moved in the southern  |Tyrrhenian_Sea|Tyrrhenian_Sea| , rapidly conquering  |Gaeta|Gaeta| ,  |Procida|Procida| ,  |Castellammare|Castellammare_Di_Stabia|  and  |Sorrento|Sorrento| . Naples, which was held by Alfonsos brother, Pedro de Aragon, was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joannas troops, now led by  |Francesco_Sforza|Francesco_Sforza| , the son of Muzio Sforza . The city fell in April 1424. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to  |Sicily|Sicily|  in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of  |Gianni_Caracciolo|Gianni_Caracciolo| .     An opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conspiracy. Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis and Joanna herself . In her will, she bequeathed her realm to  |René_of_Anjou|René_I_Of_Naples| , Louis IIIs younger brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope,  |Eugene_IV|Eugene_Iv| , who nominally was the feudal lord of the King of Naples. The Neapolitans having called in the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured  |Capua|Capua|  and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by  |Biagio_Assereto|Biagio_Assereto| . In the  |battle_of_Ponza|Battle_Of_Ponza|  that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.     In Milan, however, he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in Milans interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in February 1436. Meanwhile, papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso bribed their commander, Cardinal  |Giovanni_Vitelleschi|Giovanni_Vitelleschi| , and their successes waned.          In the meantime, René had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1438. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed. His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in August 1439. After the death of his condottiero  |Jacopo_Caldora|Jacopo_Caldora| , however, Renés fortune started to decline: Alfonso could easily capture  |Aversa|Aversa| ,  |Salerno|Salerno| ,  |Benevento|Benevento| ,  |Manfredonia|Manfredonia|  and  |Bitonto|Bitonto| . René, whose possession included now only part of the  |Abruzzi|Abruzzi|  and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. Giovanni Sforza came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the  |Marche|Marche| .     Alfonso, provided with the most impressive artillery of the times, again besieged Naples. The siege began on 10 November 1441, ending on 2 June the following year. After the return of René to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom. In 1446 he also conquered Sardinia.     Alfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope  |Eugene_IV|Eugene_Iv|  that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his illegitimate son  |Ferdinand|Ferdinand_I_Of_Naples| . He died in  |Castel_dellOvo|Castel_Dellovo|  in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of  |Genoa|Genoa| . At the time, Alfonso was at odds with  |Callixtus_III|Pope_Callixtus_Iii| , who died shortly afterwards.     His Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother John, later king  |John_II_of_Aragon|John_Ii_Of_Aragon| . Sicily and  |Sardinia|Sardinia|  were also inherited by his brother.     Alfonso was also a powerful and faithful supporter of  |Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg| , whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against  |Murad_II|Murad_Ii| . In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the  |Albania|Albania| n leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise. This was because in 1448, while Skanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by  |Demetrio_Reres|Demetrio_Reres|  along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, had been dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him.         Alfonso had been betrothed to  |Maria_of_Castile|Maria_Of_Castile|   in  |Valladolid|Valladolid|  in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in  |Valencia|Valencia|  on 12 June 1415. They failed to produce children. Alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named  |Lucrezia_dAlagno|Lucrezia_Dalagno| , who served as a de facto queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring  |muse|Muse| .     Genealogical records in the  |Old_Occitan|Occitan_Language| |_Chronicle_of_Montpellier|Chronique_Romane|  in Le petit Thalamus de Montpellier indicate that Alphonsos relationship with his mistress,  |Giraldona_Carlino|Giraldona_Carlino| , produced three children:  |Ferdinand_I_of_Naples|Ferdinand_I_Of_Naples| , .   Maria dAragon . She had married in 1444  |Leonello_dEste|Leonello_Deste_Margrave_Of_Ferrara| , deceased 1450.    |Leonora_dAragona|Leonora_Daragona| , who married circa 1443, Mariano Marzano, Duke of Squillace, Prince of Rossano. Her daughter Francesca married  |Leonardo_III_Tocco|Leonardo_Iii_Tocco| .     Giraldona was the daughter of Enrique Carlino and his wife, Isabel.       Like many Renaissance rulers, Alfonso V was a patron of the arts. He founded the Academy of  |Naples|Naples|  under  |Giovanni_Pontano|Giovanni_Pontano| , and for his entrance into the city in 1443 had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of  |Castel_Nuovo|Castel_Nuovo| .  Alfonso V supplied the theme of Renaissance sculptures over the west entrance.        Alfonso was particularly attracted to  |classical_literature|Classical_Literature| . He reportedly brought copies of the works of  |Livy|Livy|  and  |Julius_Caesar|Julius_Caesar|  on his campaigns; the poet  |Antonio_Beccadelli|Antonio_Beccadelli|  even claimed that Alfonso was cured of a disease by the reading of a few pages from  |Quintus_Curtius_Rufus|Quintus_Curtius_Rufus|  history of  |Alexander_the_Great|Alexander_The_Great| . Although this reputed erudition attracted scholars to his court, Alfonso apparently enjoyed pitting them against each other in spectacles of bawdy Latin rhetoric.      After his conquest of Naples in 1442, Alfonso ruled primarily through his mercenaries and political lackeys. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions. His holdings in Spain were governed by his brother John.     A unified General Chancellorship for the whole Aragonese realm was set up in Naples, although the main functionaries were of Aragonese nationality. Apart from financial, administrative and artistic improvements, his other accomplishments in the Sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts, the drainage of marshy areas, and the paving of streets.        Alfonso was the object of diplomatic contacts from the empire of  |Ethiopia|Ethiopia| . In 1428, he received a letter from  |Yeshaq_I_of_Ethiopia|Yeshaq_I_Of_Ethiopia| , borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the  |Muslims|Muslim|  and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require the  |Infante_Peter|Peter_Of_Aragon_Count_Of_Alburquerque|  to bring a group of artisans to Ethiopia where he would marry Yeshaqs daughter.     In return, Alfonso sent a party of 13 craftsmen, all of whom perished on the way to Ethiopia. Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, The Question of the Union of the Churches in Luso-Ethiopian Relations  , pp.13–4. He later sent a letter to Yeshaqs successor  |Zara_Yaqob|Zara_Yaqob|  in 1450, in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to Ethiopia if their safe arrival could be guaranteed, but it probably never reached the Emperor.
