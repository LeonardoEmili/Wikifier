      Robert Lowth   was a Bishop of the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| ,  |Oxford_Professor_of_Poetry|Oxford_Professor_Of_Poetry|  and the author of one of the most influential  |_textbooks_of_English_grammar|History_Of_English_Grammars| .       Lowth was born in  |Hampshire|Hampshire| , Great Britain, the son of Dr  |William_Lowth|William_Lowth| , a clergyman and Biblical commentator. He was educated at  |Winchester_College|Winchester_College|  and became a scholar of  |New_College_Oxford|New_College_Oxford|  in 1729. Lowth obtained his  |BA|Bachelor_Of_Arts|  in 1733 and his  |Master_of_Arts|Master_Of_Arts|  degree in 1737. In 1735, while still at Oxford, Lowth took orders in the  |Anglican_Church|Anglicanism|  and was appointed vicar of  |Ovington_Hampshire|Ovington_Hampshire| , a position he retained until 1741, when he was appointed  |Oxford_Professor_of_Poetry|Oxford_Professor_Of_Poetry| .     Bishop Lowth made a translation of the book of Isaiah, first published in 1778. The  |Seventh_day_Adventist|Seventh_Day_Adventist|  theologian  |E_J_Waggoner|Ellet_J_Waggoner|  said in 1899 that Lowths translation of  |Isaiah|Book_Of_Isaiah|  was without doubt, as a whole, the best English translation of the prophecy of  |Isaiah|Isaiah|  .     In 1750 he was appointed  |Archdeacon_of_Winchester|Archdeacon_Of_Bournemouth| . In 1752 he resigned the professorship at Oxford and married Mary Jackson. Shortly afterwards, in 1753, Lowth was appointed  |rector|Rector|  of  |East_Woodhay|East_Woodhay| . In 1754 he was awarded a  |Doctorate_in_Divinity|Doctor_Of_Divinity|  by Oxford University, for his treatise on  |Hebrew_poetry|Biblical_Poetry|  entitled Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum . This derives from a series of lectures and was originally published in Latin. An English translation was published by  |George_Gregory|George_Gregory|  in 1787 as  Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews . This and subsequent editions include the life of Bishop Lowth as a preface. There was a further edition issued in 1815. This was republished in North America in 1829 with some additional notes. However, apart from those notes, the 1829 edition is less useful to a modern reader. This is because the editor of that edition chose to revert to citing many of the scriptural passages that Lowth uses as examples, and some of the annotations by Michaelis  and others, in Latin.     Lowth was appointed a fellow of the  |Royal_Societies|Royal_Society|  of London and  |Göttingen|Göttingen|  in 1765. He was consecrated  |bishop_of_St_Davids|Bishop_Of_St_Davids|  in 1766; however, before the end of the year he was transferred to the  |see_of_Oxford|Bishop_Of_Oxford| . He remained Bishop of Oxford until 1777 when he was appointed  |Bishop_of_London|Bishop_Of_London|  as well as  |dean_of_the_chapel_royal|Dean_Of_The_Chapel_Royal|  and  |privy_councillor|Privy_Councillor| . In 1783 he was offered the chance to become  |Archbishop_of_Canterbury|Archbishop_Of_Canterbury| , but declined due to failing health.     Lowth was good friends with the  |Scottish_Enlightenment|Scottish_Enlightenment|  figure  |David_Hume|David_Hume| , as noted by the prominent Scottish bookseller  |Andrew_Millar|Andrew_Millar| . Millar commented that Hume and he are very great, tho one orthodox and ye other Heterodox .         Lowth wrote a Latin epitaph, Cara, Vale on the death of his daughter Maria. Much admired in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was set to music by the English composer  |John_Wall_Callcott|John_Wall_Callcott| . From New England Magazine, 1834 , accessed 20 February 2018          Lowth died in 1787, and was buried in the churchyard of  |All_Saints_Church_Fulham|All_Saints_Church_Fulham| .       Lowth seems to have been the first modern Bible scholar to notice or draw attention to the poetic structure of the  |Psalms|Psalms|  and much of the prophetic literature of the  |Old_Testament|Old_Testament| . In Lecture 19 he sets out the classic statement of  |parallelism|Parallelism| , which remains the most fundamental category for understanding Hebrew poetry. He identifies three forms of parallelism, the synonymous, antithetic and synthetic . This idea has been influential in Old Testament Studies to the present day.       Lowth is also remembered for his publication in 1762 of A Short Introduction to English Grammar. Prompted by the absence of simple and  |pedagogical|Pedagogy| |_grammar|Grammar|  textbooks in his day, Lowth set out to remedy the situation. Lowths grammar is the source of many of the prescriptive  |shibboleths|Shibboleth|  that are studied in schools, and established him as the first of a long line of usage commentators who judge the English language in addition to describing it. An example of both is one of his footnotes: Whose is by some authors made the  |possessive_case|Possessive_Case|  of which, and applied to things as well as persons; I think, improperly.     His most famous contribution to the study of grammar may have been his tentative suggestion that sentences ending with a  |preposition|Preposition| —such as what did you ask for? —are inappropriate in formal writing.  In what may have been intentional  |self_reference|Self_Reference| , Lowth used that very construction in discussing it. This is an Idiom which our language is strongly inclined to; it prevails in common conversation, and suits very well with the familiar style in writing; but the placing of the Preposition before the Relative is more graceful, as well as more perspicuous; and agrees much better with the solemn and elevated Style.  |2|Robert_Lowthnotes|  Others had previously expressed this opinion; the earliest known is  |John_Dryden|John_Dryden|  in 1672.     Lowths method included criticising false syntax ; his examples of false syntax were culled from Shakespeare, the  |King_James_Bible|King_James_Version_Of_The_Bible| ,  |John_Donne|John_Donne| ,  |John_Milton|John_Milton| ,  |Jonathan_Swift|Jonathan_Swift| ,  |Alexander_Pope|Alexander_Pope| , and other famous writers. His understanding of grammar, like that of all linguists of his period, was influenced by the study of  |Latin|Latin| , though he was aware that this was problematic and condemned forcing the English under the rules of a foreign Language  |1|Robert_Lowthnotes|  . Thus Lowth condemns  |Addisons|Joseph_Addison|  sentence Who should I meet the other night, but my old friend? on the grounds that the thing acted upon should be in the Objective Case , rather than taking this example and others as evidence from noted writers that who can refer to direct objects.     Lowths dogmatic assertions appealed to those who wished for certainty and authority in their language. Lowths grammar was not written for children; however, within a decade after it appeared, versions of it adapted for the use of schools had appeared, and Lowths stylistic opinions acquired the force of law in the schoolroom. The textbook remained in standard usage throughout educational institutions until the early 20th century.          Lowth has been regarded as the first imagery critic of Shakespeares plays and highlighted the importance of the imagery in the interpretation of motives and actions of characters and dramatic movement of the plot and narrative structure.  |3|Robert_Lowthnotes| .
