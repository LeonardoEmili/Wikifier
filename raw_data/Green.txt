                               Green is the  |color|Color|  between  |blue|Blue|  and  |yellow|Yellow|  on the  |visible_spectrum|Visible_Spectrum| . It is evoked by light which has a  |dominant_wavelength|Dominant_Wavelength|  of roughly 495570  |nm|Nanometre| . In  |subtractive_color|Subtractive_Color|  systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and  |cyan|Cyan| ; in the  |RGB_color_model|Rgb_Color_Model| , used on television and computer screens, it is one of the  |additive_primary_colors|Additive_Primary_Colors| , along with  |red|Red|  and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is  |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll| , the chemical by which plants  |photosynthesize|Photosynthesis|  and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as  |camouflage|Camouflage| . Several  |minerals|Minerals|  have a green color, including the  |emerald|Emerald| , which is colored green by its  |chromium|Chromium|  content.       During  |post_classical|Post_Classical_History|  and  |early_modern|Early_Modern_Period|  Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the  Mona Lisa  by  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci|  and the benches in the British  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons|  are green while those in the  |House_of_Lords|House_Of_Lords|  are red. It also has a long historical tradition as the color of  |Ireland|Ireland|  and of  |Gaelic_culture|Gaelic_Culture| . It is the historic color of  |Islam|Islam| , representing the lush vegetation of  |Paradise|Paradise| . It was the color of the banner of  |Muhammad|Muhammad| , and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries.       In surveys made in  |American|Americas| , European, and  |Islamic_countries|Muslim_World| , green is the color most commonly associated with  |nature|Nature| ,  |life|Life| ,  |health|Health| ,  |youth|Youth| ,  |spring|Spring| ,  |hope|Hope| , and  |envy|Envy| . In the  |European_Union|European_Union|  and the  |United_States|United_States| , green is also sometimes associated with  |toxicity|Toxicity|  and poor health, but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the  |environmental_movement|Environmental_Movement| . Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the  |Green_movement|Green_Politics| , some naming themselves  |Green_parties|Green_Party| . This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or  |environmentally_friendly|Environmentally_Friendly| , products. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a  |green_card|Permanent_Residence|  permits permanent residence in the United States.            The word green comes from the  |Middle_English|Middle_English|  and  |Old_English|Old_English|  word grene, which, like the German word grün, has the same root as the words grass and grow. Websters New World Dictionary of the American Language, The World Publishing Company, New York, 1964. It is from a  |Common_Germanic|Common_Germanic|   gronja -, which is also reflected in  |Old_Norse|Old_Norse|  grænn,  |Old_High_German|Old_High_German|  gruoni , ultimately from a  |PIE_root|Pie_Root|   to grow , and root-cognate with  grass  and  to grow .    The first recorded use of the word as a color term in Old English dates to ca. AD 700. Maerz and Paul . A Dictionary of Color New York: McGraw-Hill p. 196      |Latin|Latin|  with  viridis  also has a genuine and widely used term for green . Related to virere to grow and ver spring , it gave rise to words in several  |Romance_languages|Romance_Languages| , French vert, Italian verde .  Likewise the  |Slavic_languages|Slavic_Languages|  with  zelenъ .  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek|  also had a term for yellowish, pale green –  |χλωρός|_Wikt_Χλωρός| , chloros , cognate with χλοερός verdant and χλόη  |chloe|Chloe| , the green of new growth .     Thus, the languages mentioned above have old terms for green which are derived from words for fresh, sprouting vegetation.   However,  |comparative_linguistics|Comparative_Linguistics|  makes clear that these terms were coined independently, over the past few millennia, and there is no identifiable single  |Proto_Indo_European|Proto_Indo_European_Language|  or word for green . For example, the Slavic zelenъ is cognate with  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit|   hari  yellow, ochre, golden .    The  |Turkic_languages|Turkic_Languages|  also have jašɨl green or yellowish green , compared to a Mongolian word for meadow .             In some languages, including old  |Chinese|Chinese_Language| ,  |Thai|Thai_Language| , old  |Japanese|Japanese_Language| , and  |Vietnamese|Vietnamese_Language| , the same word can mean either blue or green. Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi, Color Appearance and the Emergence and Evolution of Basic Color Lexicons , American Anthropologist, March 1999  The  |Chinese_character|Chinese_Character| |_青|Wikt_青|   has a meaning that covers both  |blue_and_green|Distinguishing_Blue_From_Green_In_Language| ; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of  |青|Wikt_青|  . In more contemporary terms, they are  |藍|Wikt_藍|   and  |綠|Wikt_綠|   respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green,  |緑|Wikt_緑|   and グリーン . However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, aoi, because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green  shiso  will be described with the word aoi. Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green,  xanh , with variants such as xanh da trời , lam , and lục .     Green in modern European languages corresponds to about 520–570  nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using a term for the range of ca. 450–530  nm and another for ca. 530–590  nm . In the comparative study of  |color_terms|Color_Term|  in the worlds languages, green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors , or more rarely in systems with five colors .  Newman, Paul and Martha Ratliff . Linguistic Fieldwork. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, . p. 105. These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote green , but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms . Thus, the  |Thai|Thai_Language|  word เขียว kheīyw, besides meaning green , also means rank and smelly and holds other unpleasant associations.      The  |Celtic_languages|Celtic_Languages|  had a term for blue/green/grey ,  |Proto_Celtic|Proto_Celtic|  glasto-, which gave rise to  |Old_Irish|Old_Irish|  glas green, grey and to  |Welsh|Welsh_Language|  glas blue . This word is cognate with the Ancient Greek γλαυκός bluish green , contrasting with χλωρός yellowish green discussed above.     In modern Japanese, the term for green is  |緑|_Wikt_緑| , while the old term for blue/green ,  now means blue . But in certain contexts, green is still conventionally referred to as 青, as in  and , reflecting the absence of blue-green distinction in old Japanese .     The  |Persian_language|Persian_Language|  is traditionally lacking a black/blue/green distinction. The Persian word سبز sabz can mean green , black , or dark . Thus, Persian erotic poetry, dark-skinned women are addressed as sabz-eh, as in phrases like سبز گندم گون sabz-eh-gandom-gun  or سبز مليح sabz-eh-malih .  |F_Steingass|F_Steingass| , A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary s.v. سبز Similarly, in  |Sudanese_Arabic|Sudanese_Arabic| , dark-skinned people are described as أخضر akhḍar, the term which in  |Standard_Arabic|Standard_Arabic|  stands unambiguously for green . Carla N. Daughtry,  , Michigan Today, University of Michigan, Fall 1997                      In optics, the  |perception|Perception|  of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a  |wavelength|Wavelength|  of roughly 495570 |nm|Nanometre| . The sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507nm, a blue-green color, while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555nm, a yellow-green; these are the peak locations of the rod and cone  |luminosity_functions|Luminosity_Function| .      The perception of greenness  is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength M  |cone_cells|Cone_Cell|  in the eye more than the long-wavelength L cones. Light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green. A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570  nm. More specifically, blue green 487–493 nm, bluish green 493–498 nm, green 498–530 nm, yellowish green 530–559 nm, yellow green 559–570 nm      Human eyes have color receptors known as cone cells, of which there are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause  |color_blind|Color_Blind| ness, including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as  |deuteranopia|Deuteranopia|  or redgreen color blindness. The New Encyclopædia Britannica. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2002.  Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue. Laird, Donald A. Fatigue: Public Enemy Number One: What It Is and How to Fight It. The American Journal of Nursing 33.9 pp. 835–41.     In the  |subtractive_color|Subtractive_Color|  system, used in painting and color printing, green is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and  |cyan|Cyan| ; in the  |RGB_color_model|Rgb_Color_Model| , used on television and computer screens, it is one of the  |additive_primary_colors|Additive_Primary_Colors| , along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. On the  |HSV_color_wheel|Hsv_Color_Space| , also known as the  |RGB_color_wheel|_File_Rbg_Color_Wheel_Svg| , the  |complement|Complementary_Color|  of green is  |magenta|Magenta| ; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of  |red|Red|  and  |blue|Blue|  light . On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.      In additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions, one of the  |primary|Primary_Colors|  light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550nm; this green primary is combined with an orangish-red red primary and a purplish-blue blue primary to produce any color in betweenthe RGB color model. A  |unique_green|Unique_Hues|  is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary.        |Lasers|Laser|  emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state  technology to create the green light.  An infrared  |laser_diode|Laser_Diode|  at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium- |doped|Doping|  yttrium vanadium oxide or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet and induces it to emit 281.76 THz . This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus , whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam ; in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm .  Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501  nm to 543  nm.  Green wavelengths are also available from  |gas_lasers|Gas_Laser| , including the  |helium–neon_laser|Helium–Neon_Laser|  , the Argon- |ion_laser|Ion_Laser|   and the Krypton-ion laser , as well as liquid  |dye_lasers|Dye_Laser| . Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery,  |laser_light_shows|Laser_Light_Shows| ,  |spectroscopy|Spectroscopy| ,  |interferometry|Interferometry| ,  |fluorescence|Fluorescence| ,  |holography|Holography| ,  |machine_vision|Machine_Vision| ,  |non_lethal_weapons|Non_Lethal_Weapons|  and  |bird_control|Bird_Control| .      As of mid-2011, direct green laser diodes at 510nm and 500nm have become generally available,  although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use. The efficiency of these lasers  compared to that of DPSS green lasers  may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses.          Many minerals provide  |pigments|Pigment|  which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through  |luminescent|Luminescent|  or  |phosphorescent|Phosphorescent|  qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the  |emerald|Emerald| , which is colored green by trace amounts of  |chromium|Chromium|  and sometimes  |vanadium|Vanadium| . Hurlbut, Cornelius S. Jr, & Kammerling, Robert C., 1991, Gemology, p. 203, John Wiley & Sons, New York Chromium oxide , is called  |chrome_green|Chromium_Oxide| , also called  |viridian|Viridian|  or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of  |amazonites|Amazonite|  color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to  |copper|Copper|  because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of  |lead|Lead|  and water in the  |feldspar|Feldspar| .  Copper is the source of the green color in  |malachite|Malachite|  pigments, chemically known as basic  |copper_carbonate|Copper_Carbonate| .       |Verdigris|Verdigris|  is made by placing a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, slightly warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by  |Pliny|Pliny_The_Elder| . It was used by the Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks: it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact, and it was  |toxic|Toxic| .  |Leonardo_da_Vinci|Leonardo_Da_Vinci| , in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable  |chrome_green|Chrome_Green| . Viridian, as described above, was  |patent|Patent| ed in 1859. It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic.  |Vincent_van_Gogh|Vincent_Van_Gogh|  used it, along with  |Prussian_blue|Prussian_Blue| , to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting  Café Terrace at Night .      |Green_earth|Green_Earth|  is a natural pigment used since the time of the  |Roman_Empire|Roman_Empire| . It is composed of clay colored by  |iron_oxide|Iron_Oxide| ,  |magnesium|Magnesium| ,  |aluminum_silicate|Aluminum_Silicate| , or  |potassium|Potassium| . Large deposits were found in the South of France near  |Nice|Nice| , and in Italy around  |Verona|Verona| , on  |Cyprus|Cyprus| , and in  |Bohemia|Bohemia| . The clay was crushed, washed to remove impurities, then powdered. It was sometimes called Green of Verona.     Mixtures of oxidized  |cobalt|Cobalt|  and  |zinc|Zinc|  were also used to create green paints as early as the 18th century.       |Cobalt_green|Cobalt_Green| , sometimes known as  |Rinmans_green|Cobalt_Greenrinmans_Green|  or zinc green, is a translucent green pigment made by heating a mixture of cobalt oxide and zinc oxide.  |Sven_Rinman|Sven_Rinman| , a Swedish chemist, discovered this compound in 1780.  Green chrome oxide was a new synthetic green created by a chemist named Pannetier in Paris in about 1835. Emerald green was a synthetic deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide. It was also known as Guignet green. A. F. Holleman and E. Wiberg Inorganic Chemistry  |Academic_Press|Academic_Press| , 2001, New York.        There is no natural source for green  |food_colorings|Food_Coloring|  which has been approved by the US  |Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration| . Chlorophyll, the  |E_numbers|E_Number|  E140 and E141, is the most common green chemical found in nature, and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials.   |Quinoline_Yellow|Quinoline_Yellow_Ws|  is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States.   |Green_S|Green_S|  is prohibited in many countries, for it is known to cause  |hyperactivity|Hyperactivity| ,  |asthma|Asthma| ,  |urticaria|Urticaria| , and  |insomnia|Insomnia| .      To create green sparks,  |fireworks|Firework|  use  |barium|Barium| |_salts|Salt| , such as  |barium_chlorate|Barium_Chlorate| ,  |barium_nitrate|Barium_Nitrate|  crystals, or  |barium_chloride|Barium_Chloride| , also used for green fireplace logs. Copper salts typically burn blue, but  |cupric_chloride|Cupric_Chloride|  can also produce green flames. Green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75:25 of  |boron|Boron|  and  |potassium_nitrate|Potassium_Nitrate| . Smoke can be turned green by a mixture: solvent yellow 33, solvent green 3,  |lactose|Lactose| ,  |magnesium_carbonate|Magnesium_Carbonate|  plus  |sodium_carbonate|Sodium_Carbonate|  added to  |potassium_chlorate|Potassium_Chlorate| .      |chlorophyll|Chlorophyll| |_Frog|Frog| |_parrot|Parrot| |_green_huntsman_spider|Micrommata_Virescens|  is green due to the presence of  |bilin|Bilin|  pigments in the spiders  |hemolymph|Hemolymph|  and  |tissue_fluids|Interstitial_Fluid|      Green is common in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll, which is involved in  |photosynthesis|Photosynthesis| . Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light and short wavelengths of light much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green.  Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple  |halobacteria|Halobacteria|  were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using  |bacteriorhodopsin|Bacteriorhodopsin| . The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria. Goldsworthy, A. . . New Scientist, 116 48–52.        Animals typically use the color green as  |camouflage|Camouflage| , blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a  |reflection|Reflection|  of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light.  |Turacoverdin|Turacoverdin|  is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of  |porphyrin|Porphyrin|  pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are  |flavins|Flavins|  and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to ones skin include  |biliverdin|Biliverdin| , the green pigment in  |bile|Bile| , and  |ceruloplasmin|Ceruloplasmin| , a  |protein|Protein|  that carries copper  |ions|Ion|  in  |chelation|Chelation| .     The  |green_huntsman_spider|Micrommata_Virescens|  is green due to the presence of bilin pigments in the spiders hemolymph and  |tissue_fluids|Interstitial_Fluid| .  It hunts insects in green vegetation, where it is well camouflaged.               There is no green pigment in green eyes; like the color of blue eyes, it is an optical illusion; its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the  |stroma|Stroma_Of_Cornea| , given by a low or moderate concentration of  |melanin|Melanin| , with the blue tone imparted by the  |Rayleigh_scattering|Rayleigh_Scattering|  of the reflected light.

It was of very poor quality, more brown than green. Ceramics from ancient  |Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia|  show people wearing vivid green costumes, but it is not known how the colors were produced. Anne Vachiron , Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples  |Osiris|Osiris| , ruler of the underworld and of rebirth and regeneration, was typically shown with a green face.   |Stabiae|Stabiae|        In  |Ancient_Egypt|Ancient_Egypt| , green was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth, and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile. For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground  |malachite|Malachite| , mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King  |Tutankhamun|Tutankhamun| . They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue  |azurite|Azurite| . To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from  |saffron|Saffron|  and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the  |woad|Woad|  plant.     For the ancient Egyptians, green had very positive associations. The  |hieroglyph|Hieroglyph|  for green represented a growing  |papyrus|Papyrus|  sprout, showing the close connection between green, vegetation, vigor and growth. In wall paintings, the ruler of the underworld,  |Osiris|Osiris| , was typically portrayed with a green face, because green was the symbol of good health and rebirth. Palettes of green facial makeup, made with malachite, were found in tombs. It was worn by both the living and the dead, particularly around the eyes, to protect them from evil. Tombs also often contained small green amulets in the shape of  |scarab_beetles|Scarab_Beetles|  made of malachite, which would protect and give vigor to the deceased. It also symbolized the sea, which was called the Very Green. Anne Vachiron , Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples, p. 203     In Ancient Greece, green and blue were sometimes considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described the color of the sea and the color of trees. The philosopher  |Democritus|Democritus|  described two different greens: cloron, or pale green, and prasinon, or  |leek|Leek|  green.  |Aristotle|Aristotle|  considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.     The Romans had a greater appreciation for the color green; it was the color of  |Venus|Venus| , the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of  |Pompeii|Pompeii| ,  |Herculaneum|Herculaneum| ,  |Lyon|Lyon| ,  |Vaison_la_Romaine|Vaison_La_Romaine| , and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. Anne Vachiron , Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples, p. 214. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.

Modern Language Notes.  |Perugino|Perugino| , malachite pigment was used to paint the bright green garments of the worshippers, while the background greens were painted in green earth pigments.       In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the color of clothing showed a persons social rank and profession. Red could only be worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and green by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. The  |Mona_Lisa|Mona_Lisa|  wears green in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by  |Jan_van_Eyck|Jan_Van_Eyck| .     There were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight for those who wanted or were required to wear green. Green dyes were made out of the  |fern|Fern| ,  |plantain|Plantain| ,  |buckthorn|Buckthorn|  berries, the juice of  |nettles|Urtica|  and of  |leeks|Leeks| , the  |digitalis|Digitalis|  plant, the  |broom|Broom|  plant, the leaves of the  |fraxinus|Fraxinus| , or ash tree, and the bark of the  |alder|Alder|  tree, but they rapidly faded or changed color. Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with  Reseda luteola , also known as yellow-weed.     The pigments available to painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.     During the early Renaissance, painters such as  |Duccio_di_Buoninsegna|Duccio_Di_Buoninsegna|  learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.

These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes, but some contained high levels of  |arsenic|Arsenic| , and were eventually banned.     In the 18th and 19th centuries, green was associated with the  |romantic_movement|Romantic_Movement|  in literature and art. The German poet and philosopher  |Goethe|Goethe|  declared that green was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms.
