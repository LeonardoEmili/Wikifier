                 Aleister Crowley  was an English  |occultist|Occultist| ,  |ceremonial_magic|Ceremonial_Magic| ian, poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer. He founded the religion of  |Thelema|Thelema| , identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the  |Æon_of_Horus|Æon_Of_Horus|  in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.     Born to a wealthy family in  |Royal_Leamington_Spa|Royal_Leamington_Spa| ,  |Warwickshire|Warwickshire| , Crowley rejected his parents  |fundamentalist_Christian|Christian_Fundamentalism| |Plymouth_Brethren|Plymouth_Brethren|  faith to pursue an interest in  |Western_esotericism|Western_Esotericism| . He was educated at  |Trinity_College|Trinity_College,_Cambridge|  at the  |University_of_Cambridge|University_Of_Cambridge| , where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a  |British_intelligence_agency|British_Intelligence_Agency| , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898 he joined the esoteric  |Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|Hermetic_Order_Of_The_Golden_Dawn| , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by  |Samuel_Liddell_MacGregor_Mathers|Samuel_Liddell_Macgregor_Mathers|  and  |Allan_Bennett|Charles_Henry_Allan_Bennett| . Moving to  |Boleskine_House|Boleskine_House|  by  |Loch_Ness|Loch_Ness|  in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with  |Oscar_Eckenstein|Oscar_Eckenstein| , before studying  |Hindu|Hindu|  and  |Buddhist|Buddhist|  practices in India. He married  |Rose_Edith_Kelly|Rose_Edith_Kelly|  and in 1904 they honeymooned in  |Cairo|Cairo| , Egypt, where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named  |Aiwass|Aiwass| , who provided him with  The Book of the Law , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the Æon of Horus, The Book declared that its followers should Do what thou wilt and seek to align themselves with their  |True_Will|True_Will|  through the practice of  |magick|Magick| .     After  |an_unsuccessful_attempt_to_climb_Kanchenjunga|1905_Kanchenjunga_Expedition|  and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and  |George_Cecil_Jones|George_Cecil_Jones|  co-founded an esoteric order, the  |A∴A∴|A∴A∴| , through which they propagated Thelema. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based  |Ordo_Templi_Orientis|Ordo_Templi_Orientis|  , rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920 he established the  |Abbey_of_Thelema|Abbey_Of_Thelema| , a religious commune in  |Cefalù|Cefalù| , Sicily where he lived with various followers. His  |libertine|Libertine|  lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.     Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a  |recreational_drug|Recreational_Drug|  experimenter,  |bisexual|Bisexual|  and an  |individualist|Individualist| |social_critic|Social_Critic| . He has been called the wickedest man in the world and labeled as a  |Satanist|Satanist|  by the popular press. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the  |counterculture|Counterculture| , and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various biographies and academic studies.                Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in  |Royal_Leamington_Spa|Royal_Leamington_Spa| , Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875. His father, Edward Crowley , was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowleys Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born. His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop , came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as the Beast , a name that he revelled in. The couple had been married at Londons Kensington Registry Office in November 1874, and were evangelical Christians. Crowleys father had been born a  |Quaker|Quaker| , but had converted to the  |Exclusive_Brethren|Exclusive_Brethren| , a faction of a  |Christian_fundamentalist|Christian_Fundamentalist|  group known as the  |Plymouth_Brethren|Plymouth_Brethren| , with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowleys father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day. Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to  |Redhill|Redhill,_Surrey| , Surrey. At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershons evangelical Christian boarding school in  |Hastings|Hastings| , and then to Ebor preparatory school in  |Cambridge|Cambridge| , run by the Reverend Henry dArcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist.     In March 1887, when Crowley was 11, his father died of  |tongue_cancer|Tongue_Cancer| . Crowley described this as a turning point in his life, and he always maintained an admiration of his father, describing him as my hero and my friend . Inheriting a third of his fathers wealth, he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by Champney; Crowleys family removed him from the school when he developed  |albuminuria|Albuminuria| . He then attended  |Malvern_College|Malvern_College|  and  |Tonbridge_School|Tonbridge_School| , both of which he despised and left after a few terms. He became increasingly skeptical regarding Christianity, pointing out  |inconsistencies_in_the_Bible|Inconsistencies_In_The_Bible|  to his religious teachers, and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking, masturbating, and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted  |gonorrhea|Gonorrhea| . Sent to live with a Brethren tutor in  |Eastbourne|Eastbourne| , he undertook chemistry courses at  |Eastbourne_College|Eastbourne_College| . Crowley developed interests in  |chess|Chess| , poetry, and  |mountain_climbing|Mountain_Climbing| , and in 1894 climbed  |Beachy_Head|Beachy_Head|  before visiting the  |Alps|Alps|  and joining the  |Scottish_Mountaineering_Club|Scottish_Mountaineering_Club| . The following year he returned to the  |Bernese_Alps|Bernese_Alps| , climbing the  |Eiger|Eiger| ,  |Trift|Trift_Glacier| ,  |Jungfrau|Jungfrau| ,  |Mönch|Mönch| , and  |Wetterhorn|Wetterhorn| .       Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at  |Trinity_College,_Cambridge|Trinity_College,_Cambridge| , where he was entered for the  |Moral_Science|Human_Science| |Tripos|Tripos|  studying philosophy. With approval from his personal tutor, he changed to English literature, which was not then part of the curriculum offered. Crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes, becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player. Crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry, particularly the works of  |Richard_Francis_Burton|Richard_Francis_Burton|  and  |Percy_Bysshe_Shelley|Percy_Bysshe_Shelley| . Many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as  The Granta , Cambridge Magazine, and Cantab. He continued his mountaineering, going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898, often with his friend  |Oscar_Eckenstein|Oscar_Eckenstein| , and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the  |Mönch|Mönch|  without a guide. These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community.          Crowley had his first significant  |mystical_experience|Religious_Experience|  while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including  |Lawrence_Sutin|Lawrence_Sutin| ,  |Richard_Kaczynski|Richard_Kaczynski| , and  |Tobias_Churton|Tobias_Churton| , believed that this was the result of Crowleys first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his  |bisexuality|Bisexuality| . At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes, from one of whom he caught  |syphilis|Syphilis| —but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite  |their_illegality|Offences_Against_The_Person_Act_1861Unnatural_Offences| . In October 1897, Crowley met  |Herbert_Charles_Pollitt|Herbert_Charles_Pollitt| , president of the  |Cambridge_University_Footlights_Dramatic_Club|Footlights| , and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowleys increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.     In 1897, Crowley travelled to  |Saint_Petersburg|Saint_Petersburg|  in Russia, later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there. Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service, speculating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge.     In October 1897, a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and the futility of all human endeavour , and Crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult. In March 1898, he obtained  |A.E._Waites|A.E._Waite|  The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts , and then  |Karl_von_Eckartshausens|Karl_Von_Eckartshausen|  The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary , furthering his occult interests.   In 1898 Crowley privately published 100 copies of his poem Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In, but it was not a particular success. That same year he published a string of other poems, including  White Stains , a  |Decadent|Decadent_Movement|  collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the British authorities. In July 1898, he left Cambridge, not having taken any degree at all despite a  |first_class|First-Class_Honours|  showing in his 1897 exams and consistent second class honours results before that.          In August 1898, Crowley was in  |Zermatt|Zermatt| , Switzerland, where he met the chemist Julian L. Baker, and the two began discussing their common interest in  |alchemy|Alchemy| . Back in London, Baker introduced Crowley to  |George_Cecil_Jones|George_Cecil_Jones| , Bakers brother in-law, and a fellow member of the occult society known as the  |Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|Hermetic_Order_Of_The_Golden_Dawn| , which had been founded in 1888. Crowley was initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the groups leader,  |Samuel_Liddell_MacGregor_Mathers|Samuel_Liddell_Macgregor_Mathers| . The ceremony took place in the Golden Dawns Isis-Urania Temple held at Londons Mark Masons Hall, where Crowley took the magical motto and name Frater Perdurabo , which he interpreted as I shall endure to the end . Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley joined the Order under the command of the British secret services to monitor the activities of Mathers, who was known to be a  |Carlist|Carlism| .     Crowley moved into his own luxury flat at 67–69  |Chancery_Lane|Chancery_Lane|  and soon invited a senior Golden Dawn member,  |Allan_Bennett|Charles_Henry_Allan_Bennett| , to live with him as his personal magical tutor. Bennett taught Crowley more about ceremonial magic and the ritual use of drugs, and together they performed the rituals of the  Goetia , until Bennett left for South Asia to study  |Buddhism|Buddhism| . In November 1899, Crowley purchased  |Boleskine_House|Boleskine_House|  in  |Foyers|Foyers|  on the shore of  |Loch_Ness|Loch_Ness|  in Scotland. He developed a love of Scottish culture, describing himself as the Laird of Boleskine , and took to wearing traditional highland dress, even during visits to London. He continued writing poetry, publishing Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems, Tales of Archais, Songs of the Spirit, Appeal to the American Republic, and Jephthah in 1898–99; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics, although Jephthah was considered a particular critical success.     Crowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn, and was ready to enter the groups inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his bisexuality and  |libertine|Libertine|  lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation, and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including  |W._B._Yeats|W._B._Yeats| . When the Golden Dawns London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order, he visited Mathers in Paris, who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn, who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers orders, Crowley—with the help of his mistress and fellow initiate  |Elaine_Simpson|Elaine_Simpson| —attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts, a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in  |West_Kensington|West_Kensington| , from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the spaces rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group. Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers authority.       In 1900, Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States, settling in  |Mexico_City|Mexico_City|  and starting a relationship with a local woman. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with  |John_Dees|John_Dee| |Enochian|Enochian|  invocations. He later claimed to have been initiated into  |Freemasonry|Freemasonry|  while there, and he wrote a play based on  |Richard_Wagners|Richard_Wagner|   Tannhäuser  as well as a series of poems, published as Oracles . Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including  |Iztaccihuatl|Iztaccihuatl| ,  |Popocatepetl|Popocatépetl| , and  |Colima|Volcán_De_Colima| , the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he had fallen in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as Alice: An Adultery .        Briefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, where he met with Allan Bennett, who was there studying  |Shaivism|Shaivism| . The pair spent some time in  |Kandy|Kandy|  before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the  |Theravada|Theravada|  tradition, travelling to Burma to do so. Crowley decided to tour India, devoting himself to the Hindu practice of  Rāja yoga , from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of  dhyana . He spent much of this time studying at the  |Meenakshi_Temple|Meenakshi_Temple|  in  |Madura|Madurai| . At this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as The Sword of Song . He contracted  |malaria|Malaria| , and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon. In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V.  Wesseley, and  |Jules_Jacot-Guillarmod|Jules_Jacot-Guillarmod| . Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted  |K2|K2| , which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with  |influenza|Influenza| , malaria, and  |snow_blindness|Snow_Blindness| , and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of  before turning back.     Having arrived in Paris in November 1902 he socialised with friend and future brother-in-law, the painter  |Gerald_Kelly|Gerald_Festus_Kelly| , and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene. Whilst there, Crowley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance, the sculptor  |Auguste_Rodin|Auguste_Rodin| . These poems were later published as Rodin in Rime . One of those frequenting this milieu was  |W._Somerset_Maugham|W._Somerset_Maugham| , who after briefly meeting Crowley later used him as a model for the character of  |Oliver_Haddo|Oliver_Haddo|  in his novel  The Magician  . Returning to Boleskine in April 1903, in August Crowley wed Geralds sister  |Rose_Edith_Kelly|Rose_Edith_Kelly|  in a marriage of convenience to prevent her entering an  |arranged_marriage|Arranged_Marriage| ; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald. Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs , as well as authoring the religious satire Why Jesus Wept .         The Book of the Law   In February 1904, Crowley and Rose arrived in  |Cairo|Cairo| . Claiming to be a prince and princess, they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying  |Islam|Islam| ic  |mysticism|Mysticism|  and  |Arabic|Arabic| . According to Crowleys later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him they are waiting for you. On 18 March, she explained that they were the god  |Horus|Horus| , and on 20 March proclaimed that the Equinox of the Gods has come . She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary  |stele|Stele|  known as the  |Stele_of_Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu|Stele_Of_Ankh-Ef-En-Khonsu| ; Crowley thought it important that the exhibits number was 666, the  |Number_of_the_Beast|Number_Of_The_Beast|  in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the Stele of Revealing.      According to Crowleys later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of  |Aiwass|Aiwass| , the messenger of Horus, or  |Hoor-Paar-Kraat|Heru-Ra-Ha| . Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it Liber AL vel Legis or  The Book of the Law . The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new  |Aeon|Aeon| , and that Crowley would serve as its  |prophet|Prophet| . It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowleys religion,  |Thelema|Thelema| . Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with The Book of the Law. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the worlds languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.       Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowleys first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic Snowdrops From a Curates Garden to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the  |Society_for_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge|Society_For_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge| . Among its first publications were Crowleys Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back. His poetry often received strong reviews , but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was  |J._F._C._Fuller|J._F._C._Fuller| , a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, The Star in the West , heralded Crowleys poetry as some of the greatest ever written.          Crowley decided to climb  |Kanchenjunga|Kangchenjunga|  in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the worlds most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of  |Jacot-Guillarmod|Jules_Jacot-Guillarmod| , Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi,  |the_expedition|1905_Kanchenjunga_Expedition|  was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others, who thought that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowleys control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowleys warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.     Spending time in  |Moharbhanj|Hariharpur,_India| , where he took part in  |big-game_hunting|Big-Game_Hunting|  and wrote the homoerotic work The Scented Garden, Crowley met up with Rose and Lilith in  |Calcutta|Kolkata|  before being forced to leave India after non-lethally shooting two men who tried to mug him. Briefly visiting Bennett in Burma, Crowley and his family decided to tour Southern China, hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose. Spence has suggested that this trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the regions opium trade. Crowley smoked opium throughout the journey, which took the family from  |Tengyueh|Tengchong|  through to Yungchang,  |Tali|Dali,_Yunnan| ,  |Yunnanfu|Kunming| , and then  |Hanoi|Hanoi| . On the way he spent much time on spiritual and magical work, reciting the Bornless Ritual , an invocation to his  |Holy_Guardian_Angel|Holy_Guardian_Angel| , on a daily basis.     While Rose and Lilith returned to Europe, Crowley headed to Shanghai to meet old friend Elaine Simpson, who was fascinated by The Book of the Law; together they performed rituals in an attempt to contact Aiwass. Crowley then sailed to Japan and Canada, before continuing to New York City, where he unsuccessfully solicited support for a second expedition up Kanchenjunga. Upon arrival in Britain, Crowley learned that his daughter Lilith had died of  |typhoid|Typhoid_Fever|  in  |Rangoon|Yangon| , something he later blamed on Roses increasing alcoholism. Under emotional distress, his health began to suffer, and he underwent a series of surgical operations. He began short-lived romances with actress Vera Lola Neville Kaczynski 2010 p. 160 and author  |Ada_Leverson|Ada_Leverson| , while Rose gave birth to Crowleys second daughter, Lola Zaza, in February 1907.       With his old mentor George Cecil Jones, Crowley continued performing  |the_Abramelin_rituals|The_Book_Of_The_Sacred_Magic_Of_Abramelin_The_Mage|  at the Ashdown Park Hotel in  |Coulsdon|Coulsdon| , Surrey. Crowley claimed that in doing so he attained  samadhi , or union with Godhead, thereby marking a turning point in his life. Making heavy use of  |hashish|Hashish|  during these rituals, he wrote an essay on The Psychology of Hashish in which he championed the drug as an aid to mysticism. He also claimed to have been contacted once again by Aiwass in late October and November 1907, adding that Aiwass dictated two further texts to him, Liber VII and Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente , both of which were later classified in the corpus of  |The_Holy_Books_of_Thelema|The_Holy_Books_Of_Thelema| . Crowley wrote down more Thelemic Holy Books during the last two months of the year, including Liber LXVI , Liber Arcanorum , Liber Porta Lucis, Sub Figura X , Liber Tau , Liber Trigrammaton and Liber DCCCXIII vel Ararita , which he again claimed to have received from a preternatural source. Crowley stated that in June 1909, when the manuscript of The Book of the Law was rediscovered at Boleskine, he developed the opinion that Thelema represented  |objective_truth|Objectivity| .     Crowleys inheritance was running out. Trying to earn money, he was hired by George Montagu Bennett, the  |Earl_of_Tankerville|Earl_Of_Tankerville| , to help protect him from  |witchcraft|Witchcraft| ; recognising Bennetts paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice.  |Victor_Neuburg|Victor_Benjamin_Neuburg| , whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to  |Tangier|Tangier| , Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in  |sadomasochism|Sadomasochism| . Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The Worlds Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in  Vanity Fair , a magazine edited by his friend  |Frank_Harris|Frank_Harris| . He also wrote  Liber 777 , a book of magical and  |Qabalistic|Hermetic_Qabalah| |correspondences|Correspondence|  that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.          In November 1907, Crowley and Jones decided to found an occult order to act as a successor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, being aided in doing so by Fuller. The result was the  |A∴A∴|A∴A∴| . The groups headquarters and temple were situated at 124 Victoria Street in central London, and their rites borrowed much from those of the Golden Dawn, but with an added Thelemic basis. Its earliest members included solicitor Richard Noel Warren, artist  |Austin_Osman_Spare|Austin_Osman_Spare| , Horace Sheridan-Bickers, author George Raffalovich, Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding, engineer Herbert Edward Inman, Kenneth Ward, and  |Charles_Stansfeld_Jones|Charles_Stansfeld_Jones| . In March 1909, Crowley began production of a biannual periodical titled  The Equinox . He billed this periodical, which was to become the Official Organ of the A∴A∴, as The Review of Scientific Illuminism .     Crowley had become increasingly frustrated with Roses alcoholism, and in November 1909 he divorced her on the grounds of his own adultery. Lola was entrusted to Roses care; the couple remained friends and Rose continued to live at Boleskine. Her alcoholism worsened, and as a result she was institutionalised in September 1911.       In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg travelled to Algeria, touring the desert from  |El_Arba|Jendouba|  to  |Aumale|Sour_El-Ghozlane| ,  |Bou_Saâda|Bou_Saâda| , and then Dāleh Addin, with Crowley reciting the  |Quran|Quran|  on a daily basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of  |Enochian_magic|Enochian_Magic| , with Neuburg recording the results, later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice. Following a mountaintop  |sex_magic|Sex_Magic|  ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon  |Choronzon|Choronzon|  involving  |blood_sacrifice|Blood_Sacrifice| , considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The Equinox; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley enjoyed this, and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice, despite being neither.     The publicity attracted new members to the A∴A∴, among them Frank Bennett, James Bayley, Herbert Close, and James Windram. The Australian violinist  |Leila_Waddell|Leila_Waddell|  soon became Crowleys lover. Deciding to expand his teachings to a wider audience, Crowley developed the Rites of Artemis, a public performance of magic and symbolism featuring A∴A∴ members personifying various deities. It was first performed at the A∴A∴ headquarters, with attendees given a fruit punch containing  |peyote|Peyote|  to enhance their experience. Various members of the press attended, and reported largely positively on it. In October and November 1910, Crowley decided to stage something similar, the  |Rites_of_Eleusis|Rites_Of_Eleusis| , at  |Caxton_Hall|Caxton_Hall| ,  |Westminster|Westminster| ; this time press reviews were mixed. Crowley came under particular criticism from West de Wend Fenton, editor of The Looking Glass newspaper, who called him one of the most blasphemous and cold-blooded villains of modern times . Fentons articles suggested that Crowley and Jones were involved in homosexual activity; Crowley did not mind, but Jones unsuccessfully sued for libel. Fuller broke off his friendship and involvement with Crowley over the scandal, and Crowley and Neuburg returned to Algeria for further magical workings.     The Equinox continued publishing, and various books of literature and poetry were also published under its imprint, like Crowleys Ambergris, The Winged Beetle, and The Scented Garden, as well as Neuburgs The Triumph of Pan and Ethel Archers The Whirlpool. In 1911, Crowley and Waddell holidayed in  |Montigny-sur-Loing|Montigny-Sur-Loing| , where he wrote prolifically, producing poems, short stories, plays, and 19 works on magic and mysticism, including the two final Holy Books of Thelema. In Paris, he met Mary Desti, who became his next  |Scarlet_Woman|Babalon| , with the two undertaking magical workings in  |St._Moritz|St._Moritz| ; Crowley believed that one of the  |Secret_Chiefs|Secret_Chiefs| , Ab-ul-Diz, was speaking through her. Based on Destis statements when in trance, Crowley wrote the two-volume  Book 4  and at the time developed the spelling magick in reference to the  |paranormal_phenomenon|Magic|  as a means of distinguishing it from the  |stage_magic|Magic|  of illusionists.          In early 1912, Crowley published  The Book of Lies , a work of mysticism that biographer Lawrence Sutin described as his greatest success in merging his talents as poet, scholar, and magus . The German occultist  |Theodor_Reuss|Theodor_Reuss|  later accused him of publishing some of the secrets of his own occult order, the  |Ordo_Templi_Orientis|Ordo_Templi_Orientis|  , within The Book. Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental, and the two became friends. Reuss appointed Crowley as head of the O.T.Os British branch, the Mysteria Mystica Maxima , and at a ceremony in  |Berlin|Berlin|  Crowley adopted the magical name of  |Baphomet|Baphomet|  and was proclaimed X° Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britons . With Reuss permission, Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re-writing many O.T.O. rituals, which were then based largely on  |Freemasonry|Freemasonry| ; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group. Fascinated by the O.T.Os emphasis on  |sex_magic|Sex_Magic| , Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who had been initiated into the  |eleventh_degree|Ordo_Templi_Orientisinitiation_And_Teachings| .     In March 1913 Crowley acted as producer for The Ragged Ragtime Girls, a group of female violinists led by Waddell, as they performed at Londons  |Old_Tivoli|Old_Tivoli|  theatre. They subsequently performed in Moscow for six weeks, where Crowley had a sadomasochistic relationship with the Hungarian Anny Ringler. In Moscow, Crowley continued to write plays and poetry, including Hymn to  |Pan|Pan|  , and the  |Gnostic_Mass|Gnostic_Mass| , a Thelemic ritual that became a key part of O.T.O. liturgy. Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city. In January 1914 Crowley and Neuburg settled into an apartment in Paris, where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding  |Jacob_Epsteins|Jacob_Epstein|  new monument to  |Oscar_Wilde|Oscar_Wilde| . Together Crowley and Neuburg performed the six-week Paris Working , a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods  |Mercury|Mercury|  and  |Jupiter|Jupiter| . As part of the ritual, the couple performed acts of sex magic together, at times being joined by journalist  |Walter_Duranty|Walter_Duranty| . Inspired by the results of the Working, Crowley wrote Liber Agapé, a treatise on sex magic. Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley  |curse|Curse| d him.       By 1914 Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on donations from A∴A∴ members and dues payments made to O.T.O. In May he transferred ownership of Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons, and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps. During this time the  |First_World_War|First_World_War|  broke out.   After recuperating from a bout of  |phlebitis|Phlebitis| , Crowley set sail for the United States aboard the  |RMS_Lusitania|Rms_Lusitania|  in October 1914. Arriving in New York City, he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of  Vanity Fair  and undertaking freelance work for the famed astrologer  |Evangeline_Adams|Evangeline_Adams| . In the city, he continued experimenting with sex magic, through the use of masturbation, female prostitutes, and male clients of a Turkish bathhouse; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries.          Professing to be of Irish ancestry and a supporter of  |Irish_independence|Irish_Nationalism|  from Great Britain, Crowley began to espouse support for Germany in their war against Britain. He became involved in New Yorks pro-German movement, and in January 1915 German spy  |George_Sylvester_Viereck|George_Sylvester_Viereck|  employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper,  The Fatherland , which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict. In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action. In reality, Crowley was a double agent, working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germanys operation in New York. Many of his articles in The Fatherland were hyperbolic, for instance comparing  |Wilhelm_II|Wilhelm_Ii,_German_Emperor|  to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt—reported on by  The New York Times —in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the  |Statue_of_Liberty|Statue_Of_Liberty| ; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public. It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the Lusitania, informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britains side.     Crowley entered into a relationship with  |Jeanne_Robert_Foster|Jeanne_Robert_Foster| , with whom he toured the West Coast. In  |Vancouver|Vancouver| , headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with  |Charles_Stansfeld_Jones|Charles_Stansfeld_Jones|  and  |Wilfred_Talbot_Smith|Wilfred_Talbot_Smith|  to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent. In Detroit he experimented with  |Peyote|Peyote|  at  |Parke-Davis|Parke-Davis| , then visited Seattle, San Francisco,  |Santa_Cruz|Santa_Cruz,_California| , Los Angeles, San Diego,  |Tijuana|Tijuana| , and the  |Grand_Canyon|Grand_Canyon| , before returning to New York. There he befriended  |Ananda_Coomaraswamy|Ananda_Coomaraswamy|  and his wife Alice Richardson; Crowley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916, following which she became pregnant and then miscarried. Later that year he took a magical retirement to a cabin by  |Lake_Pasquaney|Newfound_Lake|  owned by Evangeline Adams. There, he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself Master Therion . He also wrote several short stories based on  |J.G._Frazers|James_George_Frazer|   The Golden Bough  and a work of literary criticism, The Gospel According to Bernard Shaw.      In December he moved to  |New_Orleans|New_Orleans| , his favourite US city, before spending February 1917 with evangelical Christian relatives in  |Titusville,_Florida|Titusville,_Florida| . Returning to New York City, he moved in with artist and A∴A∴ member Leon Engers Kennedy in May, learning of his mothers death. After the collapse of The Fatherland, Crowley continued his association with Viereck, who appointed him contributing editor of arts journal The International. Crowley used it to promote Thelema, but it soon ceased publication. He then moved to the studio apartment of Roddie Minor, who became his partner and Scarlet Woman. Through their rituals, which Crowley called The Amalantrah Workings , he believed that they were contacted by a preternatural entity named Lam. The relationship soon ended.     In 1918, Crowley went on a magical retreat in the wilderness of  |Esopus_Island|Esopus_Island|  on the  |Hudson_River|Hudson_River| . Here, he began a translation of the  Tao Te Ching , painted Thelemic slogans on the riverside cliffs, and—he later claimed—experienced  |past_life_memories|Reincarnation|  of being  |Ge_Xuan|Ge_Xuan| ,  |Pope_Alexander_VI|Pope_Alexander_Vi| ,  |Alessandro_Cagliostro|Alessandro_Cagliostro| , and  |Eliphas_Levi|Eliphas_Levi| . Back in New York City, he moved to  |Greenwich_Village|Greenwich_Village| , where he took  |Leah_Hirsig|Leah_Hirsig|  as his lover and next Scarlet Woman. He took up painting as a hobby, exhibiting his work at the Greenwich Village Liberal Club and attracting the attention of the  New York Evening World . With the financial assistance of sympathetic Freemasons, Crowley revived The Equinox with the first issue of volume III, known as The Blue Equinox. He spent mid-1919 on a climbing holiday in  |Montauk|Montauk,_New_York|  before returning to London in December.       Now destitute and back in London, Crowley came under attack from the tabloid  John Bull , which labelled him traitorous scum for his work with the German war effort; several friends aware of his intelligence work urged him to sue, but he decided not to. When he was suffering from asthma, a doctor prescribed him heroin, to which he soon became addicted. In January 1920, he moved to Paris, renting a house in  |Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau|  with  |Leah_Hirsig|Leah_Hirsig| ; they were soon joined in a ménage à trois by Ninette Shumway, and also by Leahs newborn daughter Anne Poupée Leah. Crowley had ideas of forming a community of Thelemites, which he called the  |Abbey_of_Thelema|Abbey_Of_Thelema|  after the Abbaye de Thélème in  |François_Rabelais|François_Rabelais|  satire  Gargantua and Pantagruel . After consulting the  I Ching , he chose  |Cefalù|Cefalù|  as a location, and after arriving there, began renting the old Villa Santa Barbara as his Abbey on 2 April.        Moving to the commune with Hirsig, Shumway, and their children Hansi, Howard, and Poupée, Crowley described the scenario as perfectly happy  ... my idea of heaven.  They wore robes, and performed rituals to the sun god  |Ra|Ra|  at set times during the day, also occasionally performing the Gnostic Mass; the rest of the day they were left to follow their own interests. Undertaking widespread correspondences, Crowley continued to paint, wrote a commentary on The Book of the Law, and revised the third part of Book 4. He offered a libertine education for the children, allowing them to play all day and witness acts of sex magic. He occasionally travelled to  |Palermo|Palermo|  to visit  |rent_boys|Male_Prostitution|  and buy supplies, including drugs; his heroin addiction came to dominate his life, and cocaine began to erode his nasal cavity. There was no cleaning rota, and wild dogs and cats wandered throughout the building, which soon became unsanitary. Poupée died in October 1920, and Ninette gave birth to a daughter, Astarte Lulu Panthea, soon afterwards.     New followers continued to arrive at the Abbey to be taught by Crowley. Among them was film star  |Jane_Wolfe|Jane_Wolfe| , who arrived in July 1920, where she was initiated into the A∴A∴ and became Crowleys secretary. Another was Cecil Frederick Russell, who often argued with Crowley, disliking the same-sex sexual magic that he was required to perform, and left after a year. More conducive was the Australian Thelemite Frank Bennett, who also spent several months at the Abbey. In February 1922, Crowley returned to Paris for a retreat in an unsuccessful attempt to kick his heroin addiction. He then went to London in search of money, where he published articles in  The English Review  criticising the  |Dangerous_Drugs_Act_1920|Dangerous_Drugs_Act_1920|  and wrote a novel,  Diary of a Drug Fiend , completed in July. On publication, it received mixed reviews; he was lambasted by the  Sunday Express , which called for its burning and used its influence to prevent further reprints.     Subsequently, a young Thelemite named Raoul Loveday moved to the Abbey with his wife Betty May; while Loveday was devoted to Crowley, May detested him and life at the commune. She later said that Loveday was made to drink the blood of a sacrificed cat, and that they were required to cut themselves with razors every time they used the pronoun I . Loveday drank from a local polluted stream, soon developing a liver infection resulting in his death in February 1923. Returning to London, May told her story to the press. John Bull proclaimed Crowley the wickedest man in the world and a man wed like to hang , and although Crowley deemed many of their accusations against him to be slanderous, he was unable to afford the legal fees to sue them. As a result, John Bull continued its attack, with its stories being repeated in newspapers throughout Europe and in North America. The  |Fascist|Italian_Fascism|  government of  |Benito_Mussolini|Benito_Mussolini|  learned of Crowleys activities and in April 1923 he was given a deportation notice forcing him to leave Italy; without him, the Abbey closed.           Crowley and Hirsig went to  |Tunis|Tunis| , where, dogged by continuing poor health, he unsuccessfully tried again to give up heroin, and began writing what he termed his  |autohagiography|Hagiography|  ,  The Confessions of Aleister Crowley . They were joined in Tunis by the Thelemite Norman Mudd, who became Crowleys public relations consultant. Employing a local boy, Mohammad ben Brahim, as his servant, Crowley went with him on a retreat to  |Nefta|Nefta,_Tunisia| , where they performed sex magic together. In January 1924, Crowley travelled to  |Nice|Nice| , France, where he met with  |Frank_Harris|Frank_Harris| , underwent a series of nasal operations, and visited the  |Institute_for_the_Harmonious_Development_of_Man|Fourth_Way|  and had a positive opinion of its founder,  |George_Gurdjieff|George_Gurdjieff| . Destitute, he took on a wealthy student, Alexander Zu Zolar, before taking on another American follower, Dorothy Olsen. Crowley took Olsen back to Tunisia for a magical retreat in Nefta, where he also wrote To Man , a declaration of his own status as a prophet entrusted with bringing Thelema to humanity. After spending the winter in Paris, in early 1925 Crowley and Olsen returned to Tunis, where he wrote The Heart of the Master as an account of a vision he experienced in a trance. In March Olsen became pregnant, and Hirsig was called to take care of her; she miscarried, following which Crowley took Olsen back to France. Hirsig later distanced herself from Crowley, who then denounced her.     According to Crowley, Reuss had named him head of the O.T.O. upon his death, but this was challenged by a leader of the German O.T.O., Heinrich Tränker. Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in  |Thuringia|Thuringia| , Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like  |Karl_Germer|Karl_Germer|  and Martha Küntzel championed Crowleys leadership, but other key figures like  |Albin_Grau|Albin_Grau| , Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman  |Israel_Regardie|Israel_Regardie| , who embraced Thelema and became Crowleys secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met  |Gerald_Yorke|Gerald_Yorke| , who began organising Crowleys finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended the homosexual journalist  |Tom_Driberg|Tom_Driberg| ; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works,  Magick in Theory and Practice , which received little attention at the time.     In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was deported from France by the authorities, who disliked his reputation and feared that he was a German agent. So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel  |Moonchild|Moonchild|  and book of short stories  |The_Stratagem|The_Stratagem_And_Other_Stories| . Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowleys Confessions could be published. Mandrakes owner  |P.R._Stephenson|P.R._Stephenson|  meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley, an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him.       In April 1930, Crowley moved to  |Berlin|Berlin| , where he took Hanni Jaegar as his magical partner; the relationship was troubled. In September he went to  |Lisbon|Lisbon|  in Portugal to meet the poet  |Fernando_Pessoa|Fernando_Pessoa| . There, he decided to fake his own death, doing so with Pessoas help at the  |Boca_do_Inferno|Boca_Do_Inferno|  rock formation. He then returned to Berlin, where he reappeared three weeks later at the opening of his art exhibition at the Gallery Neumann-Nierendorf. Crowleys paintings fitted with the fashion for  |German_Expressionism|German_Expressionism| ; few of them sold, but the press reports were largely favourable. In August 1931, he took Bertha Busch as his new lover; they had a violent relationship, and often physically assaulted one another. He continued to have affairs with both men and women while in the city, and met with famous people like  |Aldous_Huxley|Aldous_Huxley|  and  |Alfred_Adler|Alfred_Adler| . After befriending him, in January 1932 he took the communist  |Gerald_Hamilton|Gerald_Hamilton|  as a lodger, through whom he was introduced to many figures within the Berlin far left; it is possible that he was operating as a spy for British intelligence at this time, monitoring the communist movement.          Crowley left Busch and returned to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that he was invited to be guest of honour at  |Foyles|Foyles|  Literary Luncheon, also being invited by  |Harry_Price|Harry_Price|  to speak at the  |National_Laboratory_of_Psychical_Research|National_Laboratory_Of_Psychical_Research| . In need of money, he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed had libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against  |Constable_and_Co|Constable_&_Robinson|  for publishing  |Nina_Hamnetts|Nina_Hamnett|  Laughing Torso —a book he thought libelled him—but lost the case. The court case added to Crowleys financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had been spending three times his income for several years.     Crowley developed a friendship with  |Deidre_Patricia_Doherty|Phyllis_Marion_Gotchfamily| ; she offered to bear his child, who was born in May 1937. Named Randall Gair, Crowley nicknamed him Aleister Atatürk. Crowley continued to socialise with friends, holding curry parties in which he cooked particularly spicy food for them. In 1936, he published his first book in six years, The Equinox of the Gods, which contained a facsimile of The Book of the Law and was considered to be volume III, number 3, of The Equinox periodical. The work sold well, resulting in a second print run. In 1937 he gave a series of public lectures on yoga in Soho. Crowley was now living largely off contributions supplied by the O.T.O.s  |Agape_Lodge|Agape_Lodge|  in California, led by rocket scientist  |John_Whiteside_Jack_Parsons|Jack_Parsons| . Crowley was intrigued by the rise of Nazism in Germany, and influenced by his friend Martha Küntzel believed that  |Adolf_Hitler|Adolf_Hitler|  might convert to Thelema; when the Nazis abolished the German O.T.O. and imprisoned Germer, who fled to the US, Crowley then lambasted Hitler as a  |black_magic|Black_Magic| ian.          When the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  broke out, Crowley wrote to the  |Naval_Intelligence_Division|Naval_Intelligence_Division|  offering his services, but they declined. He associated with a variety of figures in Britains intelligence community at the time, including  |Dennis_Wheatley|Dennis_Wheatley| ,  |Roald_Dahl|Roald_Dahl| ,  |Ian_Fleming|Ian_Fleming| , and  |Maxwell_Knight|Maxwell_Knight| , and claimed to have been behind the  |V_for_Victory|V_Sign|  sign first used by the  |BBC|Bbc| ; this has never been proven.   In 1940, his asthma worsened, and with his German-produced medication unavailable, he returned to using heroin, once again becoming addicted. As  |the_Blitz|The_Blitz|  hit London, Crowley relocated to  |Torquay|Torquay| , where he was briefly hospitalised with asthma, and entertained himself with visits to the local chess club. Tiring of Torquay, he returned to London, where he was visited by American Thelemite  |Grady_McMurtry|Grady_Louis_Mcmurtry| , to whom Crowley awarded the title of Hymenaeus Alpha . He stipulated that though Germer would be his immediate successor, McMurty should succeed Germer as head of the O.T.O. after the latters death. With O.T.O. initiate  |Lady_Frieda_Harris|Lady_Frieda_Harris| , Crowley developed plans to produce a  |tarot_card|Tarot|  set, designed by him and painted by Harris. Accompanying this was a book, published in a limited edition as  The Book of Thoth  by  |Chiswick_Press|Chiswick_Press|  in 1944. To aid the war effort, he wrote a proclamation on the rights of humanity, Liber Oz, and a poem for the liberation of France, Le Gauloise. Crowleys final publication during his lifetime was a book of poetry, Olla: An Anthology of Sixty Years of Song. Another of his projects, Aleister Explains Everything, was posthumously published as  Magick Without Tears .     In April 1944 Crowley briefly moved to  |Aston_Clinton|Aston_Clinton|  in Buckinghamshire, where he was visited by the poet  |Nancy_Cunard|Nancy_Cunard| , before relocating to  |Hastings|Hastings|  in Sussex, where he took up residence at the Netherwood boarding house. He took a young man named  |Kenneth_Grant|Kenneth_Grant|  as his secretary, paying him in magical teaching rather than wages. He was also introduced to  |John_Symonds|John_Symonds| , whom he appointed to be his literary executor; Symonds thought little of Crowley, later publishing negative biographies of him. Corresponding with the illusionist  |Arnold_Crowther|Arnold_Crowther| , it was through him that Crowley was introduced to  |Gerald_Gardner|Gerald_Gardner| , the future founder of  |Gardnerian_Wicca|Gardnerian_Wicca| . They became friends, with Crowley authorising Gardner to revive Britains ailing O.T.O. Another visitor was  |Eliza_Marian_Butler|Eliza_Marian_Butler| , who interviewed Crowley for her book The Myth of the Magus. Other friends and family also spent time with him, among them Doherty and Crowleys son Aleister Atatürk. On 1 December 1947, Crowley died at Netherwood of  |chronic_bronchitis|Chronic_Obstructive_Pulmonary_Disease|  aggravated by  |pleurisy|Pleurisy|  and myocardial degeneration, aged 72. His funeral was held at a  |Brighton|Brighton|  crematorium on 5 December; about a dozen people attended, and  |Louis_Wilkinson|Louis_Wilkinson|  read excerpts from the  |Gnostic_Mass|Liber_Xv,_The_Gnostic_Mass| , The Book of the Law, and Hymn to Pan . The funeral generated press controversy, and was labelled a  |Black_Mass|Black_Mass|  by the tabloids. Crowleys ashes were sent to  |Karl_Germer|Karl_Germer|  in the US, who buried them in his garden in  |Hampton,_New_Jersey|Hampton,_New_Jersey| .                 Crowleys belief system, Thelema, has been described by scholars as a religion, and more specifically as both a  |new_religious_movement|New_Religious_Movement| , and as a magico-religious doctrine . It has also been characterised as a form of esotericism and  |modern_Paganism|Modern_Paganism| . Although holding The Book of the Law—which was composed in 1904—as its central text, Thelema took shape as a complete system in the years after 1904.     In his autobiography, Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form , although what he meant by  |paganism|Paganism|  was unclear.   Crowleys thought was not always cohesive, and was influenced by a variety of sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism,  |scientific_naturalism|Metaphysical_Naturalism| , and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology,  |Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucianism| , Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and  |Tantra|Tantra|  into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.   The historian Alex Owen noted that Crowley adhered to the modus operandi of the  |Decadent_movement|Decadent_Movement|  throughout his life.     Crowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanitys entry to the Aeon of Horus, a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny. He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship. He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus, and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon. Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe. Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of ones True Will to be the Great Work or the attaining of the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel . His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire. The moral code of Do What Thou Wilt is believed by Thelemites to be the religions ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not  |anarchistic|Anarchism|  or  |libertarian|Libertarianism|  in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.       Crowley believed in the objective existence of  |magic|Magic| , which he chose to spell Magick , an older archaic spelling of the word. He provided various different definitions of this term over his career. In his book Magick in Theory and Practice, Crowley defined Magick as the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will . He also told his disciple Karl Germer that Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level.  Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving The Equinox the subtitle of The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion. Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the  |scientific_method|Scientific_Method| , and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, The more scientific the record is, the better.  His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a  |cultural_evolution|Cultural_Evolution| ary framework. Unlike Frazer, however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science. In Crowleys alternative schema, old systems of magic had to decline so that science and magic could synthesize into magick, which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an  |experimental_method|Experiment| . Crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick, adopting an  |instrumentalist|Instrumentalism|  interpretation of magic, science, and technology.          Sexuality played an important role in Crowleys ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magicians will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a  |sacrament|Sacrament| , with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a  |Eucharist|Eucharist| . This was often manifested as the  |Cakes_of_Light|Cake_Of_Light| , a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.     Crowleys theological beliefs were not clear. The historian  |Ronald_Hutton|Ronald_Hutton|  noted that some of Crowleys writings could be used to argue that he was an  |atheist|Atheism| , while some support the idea that he was a  |polytheist|Polytheism| , and others would bolster the idea that he was a  |mystical|Mysticism| |monotheist|Monotheism| . On the basis of the teachings in The Book of the Law, Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In 1928, he made the claim that all true deities were derived from this trinity. Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that Crowley built on 19th-century attempts to  |link_early_Christianity_to_Paganism|Jesus_In_Comparative_Mythology| , such as Frazers Golden Bough, to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity.     Both during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a  |Satanist|Satanism| , usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship  |Satan|Satan| , as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist. He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as the Beast 666 and referring to the  |Whore_of_Babylon|Whore_Of_Babylon|  in his work, while in later life he sent  |Antichristmas_cards|Christmas_Card|  to his friends. In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as Our Lord God the Devil at one occasion. The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley was emphatically not a Satanist, if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such . Crowley nevertheless expressed anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity as Socialists hate soap , an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren. He was also accused of advocating  |human_sacrifice|Human_Sacrifice| , largely because of a passage in Book 4 in which he stated that A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to  |ejaculation|Ejaculation| , something not realised by his critics, thus reflecting their own ignorance and prejudice toward Crowley.       Crowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time. The historian  |Ronald_Hutton|Ronald_Hutton|  stated that in Crowleys youth, he was a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man who set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms , while being shielded from an outraged public opinion by his inherited wealth. Hutton also described Crowley as having both an unappeasable desire to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and a tendency to quarrel savagely with those who challenged him. Crowley biographer  |Martin_Booth|Martin_Booth|  asserted that Crowley was self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel . Similarly, Richard Spence noted that Crowley was capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty . Biographer  |Lawrence_Sutin|Lawrence_Sutin|  noted that Crowley exhibited courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will while at the same time showing a blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, contempt for the abilities of his fellow men . The Thelemite  |Lon_Milo_DuQuette|Lon_Milo_Duquette|  noted that Crowley was by no means perfect and often alienated those who loved him dearest.      Crowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality, with  |John_Symonds|John_Symonds|  noting that he was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time . Crowleys political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones. He was neither on the political  |left|Left-Wing_Politics|  nor  |right|Right-Wing_Politics|  but perhaps best categorised as a conservative revolutionary despite not being affiliated with the German-based  |conservative_revolutionary_movement|Conservative_Revolutionary_Movement| . Pasi described Crowleys affinity to the extreme ideologies of  |Nazism|Nazism|  and  |Marxism–Leninism|Marxism–Leninism| , which aimed to violently overturn society: What Crowley liked about Nazism and communism, or at least what made him curious about them, was the anti-Christian position and the revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements. In their subversive powers, he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions, and the creation of a void that Thelema, subsequently, would be able to fill.  Crowley described democracy as an imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness , and commented that The Book of the Law proclaimed that there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the lone wolf and the herd . In this attitude he was influenced by the work of  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche|  and by  |Social_Darwinism|Social_Darwinism| . Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine, once describing his ideology as aristocratic communism .       Crowley was bisexual, and exhibited a sexual preference for women, with his homosexual relationships being fewer and clustered in the early part of his life. In particular he had an attraction toward exotic women , and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived . Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma. During homosexual  |anal_intercourse|Anal_Sex| , he usually played the passive role, which Booth believed appealed to his masochistic side . Crowley argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation, commenting that a person must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise.  On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.     Biographer Lawrence Sutin stated that blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowleys writings . Sutin thought Crowley a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst  |John_Bull|John_Bull|  racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries , noting that he embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society, coupled with a fascination with people of colour . Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using  |anti-Semitic|Antisemitism|  slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their sublime poetry and stated that they exhibited imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity , he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest . He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a spiritual superiority to the English, and praised Muslims for exhibiting manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect .     Crowley also exhibited a general misogyny that Booth believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother. Sutin noted that Crowley largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility . Crowley described women as moral inferiors who had to be treated with firmness, kindness and justice .            Crowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in popular culture, particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world. In 2002, a BBC poll placed Crowley seventy-third in a list of the  |100_Greatest_Britons|100_Greatest_Britons| .  |Richard_Cavendish|Richard_Cavendish|  has written of him that In native talent, penetrating intelligence and determination, Aleister Crowley was the best-equipped magician to emerge since the seventeenth century.  The scholar of esotericism Egil Asprem described him as one of the most well-known figures in modern occultism . The scholar of esotericism  |Wouter_Hanegraaff|Wouter_Hanegraaff|  asserted that Crowley was an extreme representation of the dark side of the occult , adding that he was the most notorious occultist magician of the twentieth century . The philosopher John Moore opined that Crowley stood out as a Modern Master when compared with other prominent occult figures like  |George_Gurdjieff|George_Gurdjieff| ,  |P._D._Ouspensky|P._D._Ouspensky| ,  |Rudolf_Steiner|Rudolf_Steiner| , or  |Helena_Blavatsky|Helena_Blavatsky| , also describing him as a living embodiment of  |Oswald_Spenglers|Oswald_Spengler| |Faustian_Man|The_Decline_Of_The_West|  .   Biographer  |Tobias_Churton|Tobias_Churton|  considered Crowley a pioneer of consciousness research . Hutton noted that Crowley had an important place in the history of modern Western responses to Oriental spiritual traditions , while Sutin thought that he had made distinctly original contributions to the study of yoga in the West.     Thelema continued to develop and spread following Crowleys death. In 1969, the O.T.O. was reactivated in California under the leadership of Grady Louis McMurtry; in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Brazilian Thelemite  |Marcelo_Ramos_Motta|Marcelo_Ramos_Motta| .   Another American Thelemite is the filmmaker  |Kenneth_Anger|Kenneth_Anger| , who had been influenced by Crowleys writings from a young age. In the United Kingdom,  |Kenneth_Grant|Kenneth_Grant|  propagated a tradition known as Typhonian Thelema through his organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., later renamed the  |Typhonian_Order|Typhonian_Order| .   Also in Britain, an occultist known as  |Amado_Crowley|Amado_Crowley|  claimed to be Crowleys son; this has been refuted by academic investigation. Amado argued that Thelema was a false religion created by Crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings, which Amado claimed to be propagating.     Several Western esoteric traditions other than Thelema were also influenced by Crowley, with Djurdjevic observing that Crowleys influence on twentieth-century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous . Gerald Gardner, founder of  |Gardnerian_Wicca|Gardnerian_Wicca| , made use of much of Crowleys published material when composing the Gardnerian ritual liturgy, and the Australian witch  |Rosaleen_Norton|Rosaleen_Norton|  was also heavily influenced by Crowleys ideas. More widely, Crowley became a dominant figure in the modern Pagan community.  |L._Ron_Hubbard|L._Ron_Hubbard| , the American founder of  |Scientology|Scientology| , was involved in Thelema in the early 1940s , and it has been argued that  |Crowleys_ideas_influenced_some_of_Hubbards_work|Scientology_And_The_Occult| . The scholars of religion Asbjørn Dyrendel, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Petersen noted that despite the fact that Crowley was not a Satanist, he in many ways embodies the pre-Satanist esoteric discourse on Satan and Satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy , with his image and ought becoming an important influence on the later development of religious Satanism. For instance, two prominent figures in religious Satanism,  |Anton_LaVey|Anton_Lavey|  and  |Michael_Aquino|Temple_Of_Set| , were influenced by Crowleys work.     Crowley also had a wider influence in  |British_popular_culture|Culture_Of_The_United_Kingdom| . After his time in Cefalù which had brought him to public attention in Britain, various literary Crowleys appeared; characters in fiction based upon him. One of the earliest was the character of the poet Shelley Arabin in  |John_Buchans|John_Buchan|  1926 novel  The Dancing Floor . In his novel  The Devil Rides Out , the writer  |Dennis_Wheatley|Dennis_Wheatley|  used Crowley as a partial basis for the character of Damien Morcata, a portly bald defrocked priest who engages in black magic. The occultist  |Dion_Fortune|Dion_Fortune|  used Crowley as a basis for characters in her books The Secrets of Doctor Taverner and The Winged Bull . He was included as one of the figures on the cover art of  |The_Beatles|The_Beatles|  album  Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band  , and his motto of Do What Thou Wilt was inscribed on the vinyl of  |Led_Zeppelins|Led_Zeppelin|  album  Led Zeppelin III  . Led Zeppelin co-founder  |Jimmy_Page|Jimmy_Page|  bought Boleskine in 1971, and part of the bands film  The Song Remains the Same  was filmed in the grounds. He sold it in 1992.   |David_Bowie|David_Bowie|  made reference to Crowley in the lyrics of his song  |Quicksand|Quicksand|  , while  |Ozzy_Osbourne|Ozzy_Osbourne|  and his lyricist  |Bob_Daisley|Bob_Daisley|  wrote a song titled  |Mr._Crowley|Mr._Crowley|  . Crowley began to receive scholarly attention from academics in the late 1990s.
