This alteration of polarity only occurs when the axon is cut at least 10 μm shorter than the other neurites. After the incision is made, the longest neurite will become the future axon and all the other neurites, including the original axon, will turn into dendrites.

Some axons with dendritic origin similarly have a proximal initial segment that starts directly at the axon origin, while others have a distal initial segment, discernibly separated from the axon origin. In many species some of the neurons have axons that emanate from the dendrite and not from the cell body, and these are known as axon-carrying dendrites. In many cases, an axon originates at an axon hillock on the soma; such axons are said to have somatic origin . Some axons with somatic origin have a proximal initial segment adjacent the axon hillock, while others have a distal initial segment, separated from the soma by an extended axon hillock. ": null
