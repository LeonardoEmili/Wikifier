           Christiaan Neethling Barnard was a South African  |cardiac_surgeon|Cardiothoracic_Surgery|  who performed the worlds first highly publicized heart transplant and the first one in which the patient regained consciousness. On 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of accident-victim  |Denise_Darvall|Denise_Darvall|  into the chest of 54-year-old  |Louis_Washkansky|Louis_Washkansky| , with Washkansky regaining full consciousness and being able to easily talk with his wife, before dying 18 days later of pneumonia. The anti-rejection drugs that suppressed his immune system were a major contributing factor. Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading. Barnards second transplant patient  |Philip_Blaiberg|Philip_Blaiberg| , whose operation was performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for a year and a half and was able to go home from the hospital.     Born in  |Beaufort_West|Beaufort_West| ,  |Cape_Province|Cape_Province| , Barnard studied medicine and practised for several years in his native South Africa. As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of  |intestinal_atresia|Intestinal_Atresia| . His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States. In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by  |Owen_Harding_Wangensteen|Owen_Harding_Wangensteen| . He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer  |Walt_Lillehei|C._Walton_Lillehei| . Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.     He retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing  |rheumatoid_arthritis|Rheumatoid_Arthritis|  in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted  Glycel , an expensive anti-aging skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States  |Food_and_Drug_Administration|Food_And_Drug_Administration|  soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the  |Christiaan_Barnard_Foundation|Christiaan_Barnard_Foundation| , dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.       Barnard grew up in  |Beaufort_West|Beaufort_West| ,  |Cape_Province|Cape_Province| ,  |Union_of_South_Africa|Union_Of_South_Africa| . His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the  |Dutch_Reformed_Church|Dutch_Reformed_Church_In_South_Africa| . One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a blue baby who died of a heart problem at the age of three . The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnards older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris. Every Second Counts, McRae . Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the  |University_of_Cape_Town|University_Of_Cape_Town| |Medical_School|Medical_School| , where he obtained his  |MB_ChB|Mbchb|  in 1945.     His father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples. His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.       Barnard did his  |internship|Internship|  and  |residency|Residency|  at the  |Groote_Schuur_Hospital|Groote_Schuur_Hospital|  in  |Cape_Town|Cape_Town| , after which he worked as a general practitioner in  |Ceres|Ceres,_Western_Cape| , a rural town in the Cape Province.

In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar. He completed his masters degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine from the same university for a dissertation titled The treatment of tuberculous meningitis .     Soon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines. He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus. After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppys intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia. He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine . Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnards method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town. This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US. In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis. Every Second Counts, McRae, .     Owen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota. He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard. Every Second Counts, McRae, . In December 1955, Barnard travelled to the  |University_of_Minnesota|University_Of_Minnesota| ,  |Minneapolis|Minneapolis| , United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new. Every Second Counts, McRae, . Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with  |Vince_Gott|Vince_Gott|  who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer  |Walt_Lillehei|C._Walton_Lillehei| . Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve . In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation. Every Second Counts, McRae, . Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lilleheis service. It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon  |Norman_Shumway|Norman_Shumway| .  Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dogs lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast. Every Second Counts, McRae, . In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled The  |aortic_valve|Aortic_Valve|  – problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve . The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled The aetiology of congenital intestinal  |atresia|Atresia|  . Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as the most fascinating time in my life.     Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape Town.

Barnards younger brother  |Marius|Marius_Barnard| , who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnards right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery. Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the  |Tetralogy_of_Fallot|Tetralogy_Of_Fallot|  and  |Ebsteins_anomaly|Ebsteins_Anomaly| .

Along a similar line, this author states, Barnards failure to tell Washkanskys wife that her husband was dying, although its not clear whether this was pre- or post-transplant. This has been criticised by the ethicists  |Peter_Singer|Peter_Singer|  and  |Helga_Kuhse|Helga_Kuhse|  as making claims for chances of success to the patient and family which were unfounded and misleading . , Helga Kuhse, Peter Singer, Wiley-Blackwell, 2012.     Barnard later wrote, For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side. The donor heart came from a young woman,  |Denise_Darvall|Denise_Darvall| , who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear.

They would understand if he declined to give his consent. Edward Darvall took four minutes to reach his decision, mainly thinking about his daughter, including how she tried to help others. He then told the doctors, If you cant save my daughter, you must try and save this man. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lowers technique. Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. Every Second Counts, McRae, 2006, . Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvalls heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnards urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, It works.

In fact, a U.S.  |National_Institutes_of_Health|National_Institutes_Of_Health|  publication states, Within several years, only Shumways team at Stanford was attempting transplants.

Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.      Between December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971. Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors.

Full recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur. Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patients right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic in which the patients diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a double heart . Barnard performed the first such  |heterotopic|Heart_Transplantationheterotopic_Procedure|  heart transplant in 1974. , Postgrad Medical Journal, 27 July 2016. ... HHT involves transplanting the donor heart without removing the recipient heart, effectively forming a double heart. It was widely used in the pre-cyclosporine era when the donor was not strong enough or the recipient had pre-existing pulmonary hypertension. Christiaan Barnard performed the first HHT in 1974 ...     From November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.     Many surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to  |rejection_of_the_transplanted_heart|Transplant_Rejection|  by the patients immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of  |cyclosporine|Ciclosporin| , an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted  |xenotransplantation|Xenotransplantation|  in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.          Barnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africas laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nations government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad. Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law.

Shortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa;   While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa .      In answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a benevolent dictator in South Africa , Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review:    While I would abolish Social discrimination , political discrimination would continue.   He favoured the total division of the country along racial lines. His words were; I somehow feel ... but we may have to divide South Africa into two equal divisions . In a follow-up question about where the coloured people would end up in that scenario, he replied that I would include them in the white South Africa .   That coloured people have always been accepted among whites.   That the black man will not accept this view of universal suffrage.   That we are still out of the Olympic games despite the fact that in the field of sports where we have virtually integrated completely.
