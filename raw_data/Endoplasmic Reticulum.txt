           The endoplasmic reticulum  is a type of  |organelle|Organelle|  found in  |eukaryotic_cells|Eukaryote|  that forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube-like structures known as  |cisternae|Cisterna| . The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer  |nuclear_membrane|Nuclear_Membrane| . The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most eukaryotic cells, but is absent from  |red_blood_cells|Red_Blood_Cell|  and  |spermatozoa|Spermatozoa| .     There are two types of ER: rough endoplasmic reticulum  and smooth endoplasmic reticulum . The outer  face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with  |ribosomes|Ribosome|  that are the sites of  |protein_synthesis|Protein_Synthesis| . The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as  |hepatocytes|Hepatocyte| . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in  |lipid|Lipid|  synthesis but not  |metabolism|Metabolism| , the production of  |steroid_hormones|Steroid_Hormone| , and  |detoxification|Detoxification| .  The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian  |liver|Liver|  and  |gonad|Gonad|  cells.       The ER was observed with  |light_microscope|Light_Microscope|  by Garnier in 1897, who coined the term ergastoplasm . Garnier, C. 1897. Les filaments basaux des cellules glandulaires. Note préliminaire. Bibliographie anatomique, 5, 278–289.  With  |electron_microscopy|Electron_Microscopy| , the lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1969 by  |Keith_R._Porter|Keith_R._Porter| ,  |Albert_Claude|Albert_Claude| , and Ernest F. Fullam.  Later, the word  |reticulum|Wikt:Reticulumnoun|  , which means network , was applied by Porter in 1953 to describe this fabric of membranes.                  The general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called  |cisternae|Cisterna| . These sac-like structures are held together by the  |cytoskeleton|Cytoskeleton| . The  |phospholipid_membrane|Phospholipid_Membrane|  encloses the cisternal space , which is continuous with the  |perinuclear_space|Perinuclear_Space|  but separate from the  |cytosol|Cytosol| . The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function. The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes. Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.             The surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum   is studded with protein-manufacturing  |ribosomes|Ribosome|  giving it a rough appearance .  The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the  |translocon|Translocon| .  However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelles structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins  |translating|Translation|  the  |mRNA|Mrna|  of a protein destined for the  |secretory_pathway|Secretory_Pathway| .  The first 5–30  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|  polymerized encode a  |signal_peptide|Signal_Peptide| , a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a  |signal_recognition_particle|Signal_Recognition_Particle|  . Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER  |translocon|Translocon|  where translation continues with the  |nascent|Ribosome-Nascent_Chain_Complex|  protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme , which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.      The membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms large double-membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the  |nuclear_envelope|Nuclear_Envelope| .  The double membrane sheets are stacked and connected through several right- or left-handed helical ramps, the Terasaki ramps , giving rise to a structure resembling a  |multi-story_car_park|Multi-Storey_Car_Park| .   Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the  |Golgi_apparatus|Golgi_Apparatus| , membrane-bound  |transport_vesicles|Vesicle_Transport_Vesicle|  shuttle proteins between these two compartments. Endoplasmic reticulum. .  |McGraw-Hill_Encyclopedia_of_Science_and_Technology|Mcgraw-Hill_Encyclopedia_Of_Science_And_Technology| . Retrieved September 13, 2006, from Answers.com Web site:  Vesicles are surrounded by  |coating_proteins|Vesicular_Transport_Adaptor_Protein|  called COPI and COPII.  |COPII|Copii|  targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and  |COPI|Copi|  marks them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the  |Golgi_complex|Golgi_Complex|  to  |target_new_proteins|Protein_Targeting|  to their proper destinations. The second method of transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called  |membrane_contact_sites|Membrane_Contact_Site| , where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.       The rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:   Manufacture of  |lysosomal|Lysosome|  enzymes with a  |mannose-6-phosphate|Mannose-6-Phosphate|  marker added in the cis-Golgi network.  |secreted|Secretion|  proteins, either secreted constitutively with no tag or secreted in a regulatory manner involving  |clathrin|Clathrin|  and paired basic amino acids in the  |signal_peptide|Signal_Peptide| .    |Integral_membrane_proteins|Integral_Membrane_Proteins|  that stay embedded in the membrane as vesicles exit and bind to new membranes.  |Rab|Rab|  proteins are key in targeting the membrane;  |SNAP|Snap-25|  and  |SNARE|Snare|  proteins are key in the fusion event.   Initial  |glycosylation|Glycosylation|  as assembly continues. This is N-linked .   N-linked glycosylation: If the protein is properly folded,  |Oligosaccharyltransferase|Oligosaccharyltransferase|  recognizes the AA sequence  |N|Asparagine| X |S|Serine|  or  |N|Asparagine| X |T|Threonine|  and adds a 14-sugar backbone  to the side-chain  |nitrogen|Nitrogen|  of Asn.            In most cells the smooth endoplasmic reticulum  is scarce. Instead there are areas where the ER is partly smooth and partly rough, this area is called the transitional ER. The transitional ER gets its name because it contains ER exit sites. These are areas where the transport vesicles that contain lipids and proteins made in the ER, detach from the ER and start moving to the  |Golgi_apparatus|Golgi_Apparatus| . Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions. It synthesizes  |lipids|Lipids| ,  |phospholipids|Phospholipids| ,    and  |steroids|Steroids| . Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the  |testes|Testes| ,  |ovaries|Ovaries| , and  |sebaceous_glands|Sebaceous_Gland|  have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.  It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of natural metabolism products and of alcohol and drugs, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and  |steroid_metabolism|Steroid_Metabolism| .  In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion concentration. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types , and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme  |glucose-6-phosphatase|Glucose-6-Phosphatase| , which converts  |glucose-6-phosphate|Glucose-6-Phosphate|  to glucose, a step in  |gluconeogenesis|Gluconeogenesis| . It is connected to the  |nuclear_envelope|Nuclear_Envelope|  and consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance. In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.                  The sarcoplasmic reticulum , from the Greek σάρξ sarx , is smooth ER found in  |myocytes|Myocytes| . The only structural difference between this organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the medley of proteins they have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions and pumps them out into the sarcoplasm when the muscle fiber is stimulated.   After their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium ions interact with contractile proteins that utilize ATP to shorten the muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in  |excitation-contraction_coupling|Excitation-Contraction_Coupling| .        The endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called  |cisternae|Cisterna|  and the transport of synthesized proteins in  |vesicles|Golgi_Apparatusvesicular_Transport|  to the  |Golgi_apparatus|Golgi_Apparatus| . Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum  |chaperone|Chaperone|  proteins, including  |protein_disulfide_isomerase|Protein_Disulfide_Isomerase|  , ERp29, the  |Hsp70|Hsp70|  family member  |BiP/Grp78|Binding_Immunoglobulin_Protein| ,  |calnexin|Calnexin| ,  |calreticulin|Calreticulin| , and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus – unfolded proteins cause an  |unfolded_protein_response|Unfolded_Protein_Response|  as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in  |redox|Redox|  regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection  or the over-expression of proteins  can lead to  |endoplasmic_reticulum_stress_response|Xbp1Endoplasmic_Reticulum_Stress_Response|  , a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading to an increase in  |unfolded_proteins|Unfolded_Protein_Response| . This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.        Secretory proteins, mostly  |glycoproteins|Glycoproteins| , are moved across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a  |signal_sequence|Signal_Peptide| . The N-terminus of a  |polypeptide|Polypeptide|  chain contains a few  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|  that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the  |translocon|Translocon| , a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport  |vesicles|Vesicle|  and moved along the  |cytoskeleton|Cytoskeleton|  toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.      The endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention  |motif|Structural_Motif| . This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequences are  |KDEL|Kdel|  for lumen located proteins and  |KKXX|Kkxx|  for transmembrane protein.  However, variations of KDEL and KKXX do occur, and other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are three KDEL  receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established.           The endoplasmic reticulum does not harbor an ATP-regeneration machinery, and therefore requires ATP import from mitochondria. For example, the imported ATP is used for protein folding and trafficking. Clairmont, C. A., De Maio, A., & Hirschberg, C. B. 1992.  . The Journal of biological chemistry, 267: 3983-3990.PMID:1740446   The ER ATP transporter, SLC35B1/AXER, was recently cloned and characterized, AXER is an ATP/ADP exchanger in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum,  and the mitochondria supply ATP to the ER through a Ca 2+ -Antagonized Transport into the ER  mechanism Mitochondria supply ATP to the ER through a mechanism antagonized by cytosolic Ca 2+ ,  The CaATiER mechanism shows sensitivity to cytosolic Ca 2+ ranging from high nM to low μM range, with the Ca 2+ -sensing element yet to be identified and validated.       Abnormalities in  |XBP1|Xbp1|  lead to a heightened  |endoplasmic_reticulum_stress_response|Xbp1Endoplasmic_Reticulum_Stress_Response|  and subsequently causes a higher susceptibility for inflammatory processes that may even contribute to  |Alzheimers_disease|Alzheimers_Disease| .  In the  |colon|Colon| , XBP1 anomalies have been linked to the inflammatory bowel diseases including  |Crohns_disease|Crohns_Disease| .      The  |unfolded_protein_response|Unfolded_Protein_Response|  is a  |cellular_stress_response|Cellular_Stress_Response|  related to the endoplasmic reticulum.  The UPR is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded  |proteins|Protein|  in the  |lumen|Lumen|  of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting protein  |translation|Translation| , degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular  |chaperones|Chaperone|  involved in  |protein_folding|Protein_Folding| . Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been implicated in  |prion|Prion|  diseases as well as several other  |neurodegenerative_diseases|Neurodegeneration|  and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those diseases.
