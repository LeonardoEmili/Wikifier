The β-sheet  is a common motif of regular  |secondary_structure|Protein_Secondary_Structure|  in  |proteins|Protein| . Beta sheets consist of beta strands  connected laterally by at least two or three backbone  |hydrogen_bonds|Hydrogen_Bond| , forming a generally twisted, pleated sheet. A β-strand is a stretch of  |polypeptide|Peptide|  chain typically 3 to 10  |amino_acids|Amino_Acid|  long with backbone in an extended conformation. The supramolecular association of β-sheets has been implicated in formation of the protein aggregates and fibrils observed in many human diseases, notably the  |amyloidoses|Amyloidosis|  such as  |Alzheimers_disease|Alzheimers_Disease| .
