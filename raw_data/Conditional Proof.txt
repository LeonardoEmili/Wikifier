A conditional proof is a  |proof|Formal_Proof|  that takes the form of asserting a  |conditional|Material_Conditional| , and proving that the  |antecedent|Antecedent|  of the conditional necessarily leads to the  |consequent|Consequent| .       The assumed antecedent of a conditional proof is called the conditional proof assumption . Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion  |necessarily_follows|Logical_Consequence| . The validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA be actually true, only that if it were true it would lead to the consequent.     Conditional proofs are of great importance in  |mathematics|Mathematics| . Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven  |conjectures|Conjecture| , so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a propositions truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.     A famous network of conditional proofs is the  |NP-complete|Np-Complete|  class of complexity theory. There is a  |large_number|List_Of_Np-Complete_Problems|  of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them. Similarly, the  |Riemann_hypothesis|Riemann_Hypothesis|  has many consequences already proven.       As an example of a conditional proof in  |symbolic_logic|Mathematical_Logic| , suppose we want to prove A â†’ C from the first two premises below:     .
