His reign was marked by ineffective governance during the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| . He was the father of  |Frederick_William_the_Great_Elector_|Frederick_William_Elector_Of_Brandenburg| .           Born in  |Cölln|Cölln|  on the  |Spree|Spree|  , George William was the son of  |John_Sigismund_Margrave_of_Brandenburg|John_Sigismund_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg|  and  |Anna_of_Prussia|Anna_Of_Prussia| . His maternal grandfather was  |Albert_Frederick_Duke_of_Prussia|Albert_Frederick_Duke_Of_Prussia| . In 1616 George William married  |Elisabeth_Charlotte_of_the_Palatinate|Elizabeth_Charlotte_Of_The_Palatinate| . Their only son  |Frederick_William|Frederick_William_Elector_Of_Brandenburg|  later became known as the Great  |Elector|Prince_Elector|  . Of his two daughters, the eldest,  |Louise_Charlotte|Louise_Charlotte_Of_Brandenburg| , married  |Jacob_Kettler_Duke_of_Courland|Jacob_Kettler| , and the younger,  |Hedwig_Sophie|Hedwig_Sophia_Of_Brandenburg| , married  |William_VI_Landgrave_of_Hesse_Kassel|William_Vi_Landgrave_Of_Hesse_Kassel| .        In 1619 George William inherited the  |Margravate_of_Brandenburg|Margravate_Of_Brandenburg|  and the  |Duchy_of_Prussia|Duchy_Of_Prussia| . He paid his  |feudal_homage|Homage|  in person to the  |King_of_Poland|King_Of_Poland| ,  |Sigismund_III_Vasa|Sigismund_Iii_Vasa| , in September 1621 in  |Warsaw|Warsaw|  . The homage was renewed in 1633 after the election of a new Polish king,  |Władysław_IV_Vasa|Władysław_Iv_Vasa| . During the  |Thirty_Years_War|Thirty_Years_War| , the  |Reformed|Continental_Reformed_Church|  George William tried to remain neutral between the  |Roman_Catholic|Roman_Catholic|  forces of the  |Holy_Roman_Empire|Holy_Roman_Empire|  and the  |Protestant|Protestantism|  principalities. As his sister  |Maria_Eleonora_of_Brandenburg|Maria_Eleonora_Of_Brandenburg|  was queen of  |Sweden|Swedish_Empire| , George William had to maneuver between requests of assistance from his Lutheran brother-in-law King  |Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden|Gustavus_Adolphus_Of_Sweden|  and his own Protestant counsellors on one side and his Catholic chancellor Count  |Adam_von_Schwarzenberg|Adam_Von_Schwarzenberg|  on the other.     Despite his attempts at neutrality, George William was forced by  |Gustavus_Adolphus|Gustavus_Adolphus_Of_Sweden| , since 1626 occupying  |Ducal_Prussias_access_to_the_sea|Strait_Of_Baltiysk| , to join the Protestant forces in 1631. His rule was largely weak and ineffective, as much of government responsibilities in  |Brandenburg_Prussia|Brandenburg_Prussia|  was turned over to Schwarzenberg as the country suffered greatly during the war. Protestant and Catholic troops alike burned and plundered the  |Brandenburg_region|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg|  and the population was decimated there as it was throughout the  |German_states|List_Of_States_In_The_Holy_Roman_Empire| . Clark, p. 26. Whereas  |Ducal_Prussia|Ducal_Prussia|  remained mostly untouched.     With his brother-in-law Gustavus dead in 1632, George William maintained the Swedish alliance until after the Swedish defeat at the  |Battle_of_Nördlingen|Battle_Of_Nördlingen|  on 6 September 1634. At that point, George William withdrew Brandenburg from the war and signed the  |Peace_of_Prague|Peace_Of_Prague|  with Emperor  |Ferdinand_II|Ferdinand_Ii_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  on 30 May 1635. Leaving Schwarzenberg in charge of the government, George William withdrew in 1637 to the relatively safe region of Ducal Prussia, where he lived in retirement until his death at  |Königsberg_in_Prussia|Königsberg|  in 1640.
