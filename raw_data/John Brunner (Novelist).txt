He married Marjorie Rosamond Sauer on 12 July 1958.     Brunner had an uneasy relationship with British  |new_wave|New_Wave_Science_Fiction|  writers, who often considered him too American in his settings and themes. He attempted to shift to a more mainstream readership in the early 1980s, without success. Before his death, most of his books had fallen out of print. Brunner accused publishers of a conspiracy against him. But he was known to be difficult to deal with . Smith, Jad, , University of Illinois Press.

At first writing conventional  |space_opera|Space_Opera| , Brunner later began to experiment with the novel form. His 1968 novel  Stand on Zanzibar  exploits the fragmented organizational style that American writer  |John_Dos_Passos|John_Dos_Passos|  created for his  USA trilogy , but updates it in terms of the theory of media popularised by Canadian academic  |Marshall_McLuhan|Marshall_Mcluhan| , a major cultural figure of the period.      The Jagged Orbit  is set in a United States dominated by weapons proliferation and interracial violence. Its 100 numbered chapters vary in length from a single syllable to several pages in length.  The Sheep Look Up  depicts ecological catastrophe in America.     Brunner is credited with coining the term  |worm|Computer_Worm|  and predicting the emergence of  |computer_virus|Computer_Virus| es in his 1975 novel  The Shockwave Rider , in which he used the term to describe software which reproduces itself across a computer network.
