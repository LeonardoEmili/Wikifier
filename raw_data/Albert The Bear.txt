        Albert the Bear  was the first  |Margrave_of_Brandenburg|Margrave_Of_Brandenburg|  from 1157 to his death and was briefly  |Duke_of_Saxony|Duke_Of_Saxony|  between 1138 and  1142.       Albert was the only son of  |Otto,_Count_of_Ballenstedt|Otto,_Count_Of_Ballenstedt| , and  |Eilika|Eilika_Of_Saxony| , daughter of  |Magnus_Billung|Magnus,_Duke_Of_Saxony| ,  |Duke_of_Saxony|Rulers_Of_Saxony| . He inherited the valuable estates in northern Saxony of his father in 1123, and on his mothers death, in 1142, succeeded to one-half of the lands of the house of  |Billung|Billung| . Albert was a loyal  |vassal|Vassal|  of his relation,  |Lothar_I,_Duke_of_Saxony|Lothair_Iii,_Holy_Roman_Emperor| , from whom, about 1123, he received the Margraviate of  |Lusatia|Lusatia| , to the east; after Lothar became  |King_of_the_Germans|King_Of_The_Germans| , he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to  |Bohemia|Bohemia|  against the upstart,  |Soběslav_I,_Duke_of_Bohemia|Soběslav_I,_Duke_Of_Bohemia|  in 1126 at the  |Battle_of_Kulm|Battle_Of_Chlumec| , where he suffered a short imprisonment.     Alberts entanglements in Saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there. After the death of his brother-in-law,  |Henry_II,_Margrave_of_the_Nordmark|Henry_Ii,_Margrave_Of_The_Nordmark| , who controlled a small area on the Elbe called the Saxon  |Northern_March|Northern_March| , in 1128, Albert, disappointed at not receiving this fief himself, attacked  |Udo_V,_Count_of_Stade|Udo_Iv,_Margrave_Of_The_Nordmark| , the heir, and was consequently deprived of Lusatia by Lothar. Udo, however, was said to have been assassinated by servants of Albert on 15 March 1130 near  |Aschersleben|Aschersleben| . In spite of this, he went to  |Italy|Italy|  in 1132 in the train of the king, and his services there were rewarded in 1134 by the investiture of the Northern March, which was again without a ruler.          In 1138  |Conrad_III|Conrad_Iii_Of_Germany| , the Hohenstaufen King of the Germans, deprived Alberts cousin and nemesis,  |Henry_the_Proud|Henry_X,_Duke_Of_Bavaria|  of his Saxon duchy, which was awarded to Albert if he could take it. After some initial success in his efforts to take possession, Albert was driven from Saxony, and also from his Northern march by a combined force of Henry and  |Jaxa_of_Köpenick|Jaxa_Of_Köpenick| , and compelled to take refuge in south Germany. When peace was made with Henry in 1142, Albert renounced the Saxon duchy and received the counties of  |Weimar|Weimar|  and  |Orlamünde|Orlamünde| . It was possibly at this time that Albert was made Archchamberlain of the Empire, an office which afterwards gave the Margraves of Brandenburg the rights of a  |prince-elector|Prince-Elector| .     Once he was firmly established in the Northern March, Alberts covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east. For three years he was occupied in campaigns against the Slavic  |Wends|Wends| , who as pagans were considered fair game, and whose subjugation to Christianity was the aim of the  |Wendish_Crusade|Wendish_Crusade|  of 1147 in which Albert took part. Albert was a part of the army that besieged  |Demmin|Demmin| . And at the end of the war, recovered  |Havelberg|Havelberg| , which had been lost since 983. Diplomatic measures were more successful, and by an arrangement made with the last of the Wendish princes of Brandenburg,  |Pribislav|Pribislav_Of_Brandenburg|  of the  |Hevelli|Hevelli| , Albert secured this district when the prince died in 1150. Taking the title Margrave in Brandenburg , he pressed the crusade against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, encouraged German migration, established bishoprics under his protection, and so became the founder of the  |Margraviate_of_Brandenburg|Margraviate_Of_Brandenburg|  in 1157, which his heirs   the  |House_of_Ascania|House_Of_Ascania|    held until the line died out in 1320.     In 1158 a feud with Henrys son,  |Henry_the_Lion|Henry_The_Lion| , Duke of Saxony, was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the  |Holy_Land|Holy_Land| . On his return in 1160, he, with the consent of his sons; Siegfried not being mentioned, donated land to the  |Knights_of_Saint_John|Knights_Of_Saint_John|  in memory of his wife, Sofia, at  |Werben|Werben|  at the  |Elbe|Elbe| . In 1162 Albert accompanied Emperor  |Frederick_Barbarossa|Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|  to  |Italy|Italy| , where he distinguished himself at the storming of  |Milan|Milan| .     In 1164 Albert joined a league of princes formed against Henry the Lion, and peace being made in 1169, Albert divided his territories among his six sons. He died on 13 November 1170, possibly in  |Stendal|Stendal| , and was buried at  |Ballenstedt|Ballenstedt| .          Alberts personal qualities won for him the  |cognomen|Cognomen|  of the Bear , not from his looks or qualities, for he was a tall handsome man, but from the cognisance on his shield, an able man, had a quick eye as well as a strong hand, and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things, was the shining figure and the great man of the North in his day, got much in the North and kept it, got Brandenburg for one there, a conspicuous country ever since, says  |Carlyle|Thomas_Carlyle| , who called Albert a restless, much-managing, wide-warring man. He is also called by later writers the Handsome.       Albert was married in 1124 to  |Sophie_of_Winzenburg|Sophie_Of_Winzenburg|  and they had the following children:    |Otto_I,_Margrave_of_Brandenburg|Otto_I,_Margrave_Of_Brandenburg|     Count  |Hermann_I_of_Orlamünde|Hermann_I_Of_Orlamünde| |Siegfried|Siegfried,_Count_Of_Anhalt|  ,  |Bishop_of_Brandenburg|Bishopric_Of_Brandenburg|  from 1173–1180,  |Prince-Archbishop_of_Bremen|Archbishop_Of_Bremen| , the first ranked prince, from 1180–1184   Heinrich , a canon in  |Magdeburg|Magdeburg|    Count  |Albert_of_Ballenstedt|Albert_Of_Ballenstedt|    Count  |Dietrich_of_Werben|Dietrich_Of_Werben|     Count  |Bernhard_of_Anhalt|Bernhard,_Count_Of_Anhalt|  ,  |Duke_of_Saxony|Duke_Of_Saxony|  from 1180-1212 as Bernard III    |Hedwig|Hedwig_Of_Brandenburg|  , married to  |Otto_II,_Margrave_of_Meissen|Otto_Ii,_Margrave_Of_Meissen|    Daughter, married c. 1152 to  |Vladislav_of_Bohemia|Vladislav_Of_Bohemia|    Adelheid , a nun in  |Lamspringe|Lamspringe|    Gertrude, married in 1155 to Duke  |Diepold_of_Moravia|Děpold_I_Of_Jamnitz|    Sybille , Abbess of  |Quedlinburg|Quedlinburg_Abbey|    Eilika           .
