                     James Earl Carter Jr. is an American politician and philanthropist who served as the 39th  |president_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States|  from 1977 to 1981. A member of the  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party| , he previously served as a  |Georgia_State_Senator|Georgia_State_Senate|  from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th  |Governor_of_Georgia|List_Of_Governors_Of_Georgia|  from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained active in the private sector; in 2002, he was awarded the  |Nobel_Peace_Prize|Nobel_Peace_Prize|  for his work in co-founding the  |Carter_Center|Carter_Center| .     Raised in  |Plains_Georgia|Plains_Georgia| , Carter graduated from the  |United_States_Naval_Academy|United_States_Naval_Academy|  in 1946 with a  |Bachelor_of_Science|Bachelor_Of_Science|  degree and joined the  |United_States_Navy|United_States_Navy| , where he served on  |submarines|Submarine| . After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his familys peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little due to his fathers forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carters peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of  |racial_segregation|Racial_Segregation_In_The_United_States|  and support the growing  |civil_rights_movement|Civil_Rights_Movement| . He became an activist within the  |Democratic_Party|Democratic_Party| . From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the  |Georgia_State_Senate|Georgia_State_Senate| , and in  |1970|1970_Georgia_Gubernatorial_Election| , he was elected as  |Governor_of_Georgia|Governor_Of_Georgia| , defeating former Governor  |Carl_Sanders|Carl_Sanders|  in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating  |affirmative_action|Affirmative_Action|  for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a  |dark_horse_candidate|Dark_Horse|  who was little known outside of Georgia at the start of the campaign, Carter won the  |1976_Democratic_presidential_nomination|Democratic_Party_Presidential_Primaries_1976| . In the  |general_election|1976_United_States_Presidential_Election| , Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent  |Republican|Republican_Party|  President  |Gerald_Ford|Gerald_Ford| . An  |evangelical_Christian|Evangelicalism| , Carter is credited with significantly moving the faith closer to the American mainstream; him advertising his devout Christian faith as a qualification on the campaign trail was unprecedented at the time and is seen as a significant event in the rise of the  |Christian_right|Christian_Right|  in America, even though they and Carter were political opponents.      On his second day in office, Carter  |pardoned|Federal_Pardons_In_The_United_States|  all the  |Vietnam_War_draft_evaders|Draft_Evasion| . During Carters term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the  |Department_of_Energy|United_States_Department_Of_Energy|  and the  |Department_of_Education|United_States_Department_Of_Education| , were established. He established a  |national_energy_policy|Energy_Policy_Of_The_United_States|  that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the  |Camp_David_Accords|Camp_David_Accords| , the  |Panama_Canal_Treaties|Panama_Canal_Treaties| , the second round of  |Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks|Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks|  , and the return of the  |Panama_Canal_Zone|Panama_Canal_Zone|  to Panama. On the economic front, he confronted persistent  |stagflation|Stagflation| , a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981  |Iran_hostage_crisis|Iran_Hostage_Crisis| , the  |1979_energy_crisis|1979_Energy_Crisis| , the  |Three_Mile_Island_nuclear_accident|Three_Mile_Island_Nuclear_Accident| , and the  |Soviet_invasion_of_Afghanistan|Soviet_Invasion_Of_Afghanistan| . In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the  |Cold_War|Cold_War|  when he ended  |détente|Détente| , imposed  |a_grain_embargo_against_the_Soviets|United_States_Grain_Embargo_Against_The_Soviet_Union| , enunciated the  |Carter_Doctrine|Carter_Doctrine| , and led an  |1980_Summer_Olympics_boycott|1980_Summer_Olympics_Boycott|  in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator  |Ted_Kennedy|Ted_Kennedy|  in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the  |1980_Democratic_National_Convention|1980_Democratic_National_Convention| . Carter lost the  |general_election|1980_United_States_Presidential_Election|  to Republican nominee  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan|  in an electoral landslide.  |Polls_of_historians_and_political_scientists|Historical_Rankings_Of_Presidents_Of_The_United_States|  usually rank Carter as an average president; he often receives more positive evaluations for his post-presidential work.     In 1982, he established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and  |eradication|Eradication_Of_Infectious_Diseases|  in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the  |Habitat_for_Humanity|Habitat_For_Humanity|  charity. He has written  |over_30_books|Bibliography_Of_Jimmy_Carter|  ranging from political memoirs to poetry while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, such as the  |Israeli_Palestinian_conflict|Israeli_Palestinian_Conflict| . The earliest-serving of the five  |living_U_S_presidents|Living_Presidents_Of_The_United_States| , Carter is the  |longest_lived_president|List_Of_Presidents_Of_The_United_States_By_Age| , the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95.             James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanitarium  in  |Plains_Georgia|Plains_Georgia| , a hospital where his mother was employed as a registered nurse. Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital. He was the eldest son of  |Bessie_Lillian|Lillian_Gordy_Carter|   and  |James_Earl_Carter_Sr_|James_Earl_Carter_Sr_|  Carter is a descendant of  |English|English_People|  immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in  |Virginia|Virginia|  in 1635. Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Carter is also a descendant of  |Thomas_Cornell|Thomas_Cornell| , an ancestor of  |Cornell_Universitys|Cornell_University|  founder, and is distantly related to  |Richard_Nixon|Richard_Nixon|  and  |Bill_Gates|Bill_Gates| .         Plains was a  |boomtown|Boomtown|  of 600 people at the time of Carters birth. Carters father was a successful local businessman, who ran a  |general_store|General_Store| , and was an investor in farmland. He previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Armys  |Quartermaster_Corps|Quartermaster_Corps|  during  |World_War_I|World_War_I| .     The family moved several times during Carter Jr.s infancy. Bourne, pp. 11–32. The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby  |Archery|Archery_Georgia| , which was almost entirely populated by impoverished  |African_American|African_American|  families. They eventually had three more children:  |Gloria|Gloria_Carter_Spann| ,  |Ruth|Ruth_Carter_Stapleton| , and  |Billy|Billy_Carter| . Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. Although Earl was staunchly pro- |segregation|Racial_Segregation_In_The_United_States| , he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands children. Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earls farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.       Carter attended the Plains High School from 1937 to 1941. By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the  |Great_Depression|Great_Depression_In_The_United_States| , but the family benefited from  |New_Deal|New_Deal|  farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader. Young Jimmy was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for  |valedictorian|Valedictorian|  after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a  |hot_rod|Hot_Rod| . Carters truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have been valedictorian anyway. Bourne, pp. 33–43. Carters teacher, Julia Coleman, was an especially strong influence. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the  |Future_Farmers_of_America|National_Ffa_Organization|  and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.       Carter had long dreamed of attending the  |U_S_Naval_Academy|United_States_Naval_Academy| . In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at  |Georgia_Southwestern_College|Georgia_Southwestern_College|  in nearby  |Americus|Americus_Georgia| . The following year, he transferred to the  |Georgia_Institute_of_Technology|Georgia_Institute_Of_Technology|  in Atlanta, and he achieved admission to the Naval Academy in 1943. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academys culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with his sister Ruths friend Rosalynn Smith, whom he married shortly after his graduation in 1946. Bourne, pp. 44–55. He was a  |sprint_football|Sprint_Football|  player for the  |Navy_Midshipmen|Navy_Midshipmen| .  Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a  |Bachelor_of_Science|Bachelor_Of_Science|  degree and was commissioned as an  |ensign|Ensign| . Annual Register of the United States Naval Academy , p. 33 From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his deployments in the  |Atlantic|Us_Atlantic_Fleet|  and  |Pacific_fleets|Us_Pacific_Fleet| . Zelizer, pp. 11–12. In 1948, he began officers training for submarine duty and served aboard . He was promoted to  |lieutenant_junior_grade|Lieutenant|  in 1949. In 1951 he became attached to the diesel/electric USS K-1, , qualified for command, and served in several duties including Executive Officer.           In 1952, Carter began an association with the  |US_Navys|United_States_Navy|  fledgling  |nuclear_submarine|Nuclear_Submarine|  program, then led by Captain  |Hyman_G_Rickover|Hyman_G_Rickover| . Rickovers demands on his men and machines were legendary, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover was the greatest influence on his life. Bourne, pp. 72–77. He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the  |Atomic_Energy_Commission|United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission|  in Washington, D.C. for three month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York. On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at  |Atomic_Energy_of_Canadas|Atomic_Energy_Of_Canada| |_Chalk_River_Laboratories|Chalk_River_Laboratories|  caused a partial meltdown resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor buildings basement and leaving the reactors core ruined.  Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.  The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for a few minutes at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease development of a  |neutron_bomb|Neutron_Bomb| .      In March 1953 Carter began nuclear power school, a six-month non-credit course covering nuclear power plant operation at  |Union_College|Union_College|  in Schenectady, with the intent to eventually work aboard , which was planned to be one of the first two U.S. nuclear submarines. However, Carters father died two months before construction of Seawolf began, and Carter sought and obtained a release from active duty to enable him to take over the family peanut business. Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult. Settling after moving so much, Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life. Returning to small-town life in Plains seemed a monumental step backward, she said later. On the other hand, Carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his fathers. Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953. Bourne, pp. 77–81. Hayward, p. 23. He served in the inactive  |Navy_Reserve|United_States_Navy_Reserve|  until 1961, and left the service with the rank of  |lieutenant|Lieutenant| .  His awards included the  |American_Campaign_Medal|American_Campaign_Medal| ,  |World_War_II_Victory_Medal|World_War_Ii_Victory_Medal| ,  |China_Service_Medal|China_Service_Medal| , and  |National_Defense_Service_Medal|National_Defense_Service_Medal| .        Earl Carter died a relatively wealthy man, having recently been elected to the  |Georgia_House_of_Representatives|Georgia_House_Of_Representatives| . However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little. For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in  |public_housing|Public_Housing|  in Plains; Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in subsidized housing before he took office. Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the familys peanut-growing business. The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult because his first-year harvest failed due to drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat. Meanwhile, he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the businesss books. Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful. Bourne, pp. 83–91. Morris, p. 115.           Racial tension was inflamed in Plains by the 1954  |U_S_Supreme_Courts|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States|  anti-segregation ruling in  Brown v. Board of Education .  Carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integration—at one point, the local  |White_Citizens_Council|Citizens_Councils|  boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join them—but he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961 he was a prominent member of the community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board, where he began to speak more loudly in favor of school integration. Bourne, pp. 92–108. A  |state_Senate|Georgia_Senate|  seat was opened by the dissolution of Georgias  |County_Unit_System|County_Unit_System|  in 1962; Carter announced his run for the seat 15 days before the election. Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. The initial results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the Democratic Party chairman in  |Quitman_County|Quitman_County_Georgia| , with the aid of the Quitman County sheriff.  Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won. Bourne, pp. 108–132.     The  |civil_rights_movement|Civil_Rights_Movement|  was well underway when Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch  |John_F_Kennedy|John_F_Kennedy|  supporters. Beginning in 1962, the town of Americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters,  echoing similar unrest throughout the country. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. He did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against  |literacy_tests|Literacy_Tests|  and against a change to the Georgia Constitution which, he felt, implied a compulsion to practice religion. Bourne, pp. 132–140. At the time of  |President_Kennedys_assassination|Assassination_Of_John_F_Kennedy| , Carter was informed by a customer of his peanut business of the killing, prompting Carter to remove himself from work and sit alone. Carter later called the assassination the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died.      Carter was a diligent legislator who took speed-reading courses to keep up with the workload. Within two years, his connections landed him on the state Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state partys rules. He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration.     When  |Bo_Callaway|Bo_Callaway|  was elected to the  |U_S_House_of_Representatives|United_States_House_Of_Representatives|  in November 1964, Carter immediately began planning to unseat him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state; Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater,  |Georgia_Southwestern_College|Georgia_Southwestern_College| , but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown  |Columbus|Columbus_Georgia| . Carter saw Callaway, a  |Republican|Republican_Party| , as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics. Bourne, pp. 132–145.     Carter was re-elected in 1964 to serve a second two-year term.  For a time in the State Senate, he chaired its Education Committee; he also sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term. Before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. The last day of the term, he announced his run for Congress. Bourne, pp. 145–149.          The race for  |Georgias_3rd_congressional_district|Georgias_3Rd_Congressional_District|  in 1966 was shaken up in mid-May when the incumbent, Bo Callaway, dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia instead. Callaway had just switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in 1964, and was a very strong candidate, despite being the first Republican to run for Governor of Georgia since 1876. State Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since  |Reconstruction|Reconstruction_Era| . Carter decided to run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran against the liberal former governor  |Ellis_Arnall|Ellis_Arnall|  and the conservative segregationist  |Lester_Maddox|Lester_Maddox| . In a press conference he described his ideology as Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road.  ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that. Bourne, pp. 149–153. He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a  |runoff_election|Two_Round_System|  with Maddox. Maddox narrowly won the runoff ballot over Arnall to the Democratic Party nomination. In the general election, Callaway went on to win a plurality of the vote, but short of a 50 percent majority, state rules empowered the Georgia House of Representatives, which had a Democratic Party majority, to elect Maddox as governor. The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt. His attempt to rescue the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox, which he considered an even worse outcome. Bourne, pp. 153–165.     Carter returned to his agriculture business and, during the next four years, carefully planned his next campaign for governor in 1970. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and  |liberal|Modern_Liberalism_In_The_United_States|  theologians such as  |Reinhold_Niebuhr|Reinhold_Niebuhr| , he declared himself  |Born_again|Born_Again| , a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child  |Amy|Amy_Carter|  was born during this time, on October 19, 1967. Bourne, pp. 165–179. Hayward, pp. 39–46.          Governor Maddox was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term as governor, and thus the liberal former governor,  |Carl_Sanders|Carl_Sanders| , became Carters main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more  |conservative|Conservatism_In_The_United_States|  than before. He positioned himself as a  |populist|Populism| , quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence. Bourne, pp. 180–199. Hayward, pp. 46–51. Throughout the campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the Wallace vote, after the prominent segregationist  |George_Wallace|George_Wallace|  of Alabama. While he met with black figures such as  |Martin_Luther_King_Sr_|Martin_Luther_King_Sr_|  and  |Andrew_Young|Andrew_Young| , and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools, depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carters senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.     That September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff. The subsequent campaign grew even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carters campaign criticized Sanders for supporting  |Martin_Luther_King_Jr_|Martin_Luther_King_Jr_|  Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote—winning 7 percent of the black vote—and went on to win the general election easily over the Republican  |Hal_Suit|Hal_Suit| , a local news anchor. Once he was elected, Carter changed his tone, and began to speak against Georgias racist politics.  |Leroy_Johnson|Leroy_Johnson| , a black state Senator, voiced his support for Carter, saying, I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign.  ... I dont believe you can win this state without being a racist.          Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. He declared in his inaugural speech that the time of racial discrimination is over.  ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice.  The crowd was reportedly shocked by this message, contrasting starkly with Georgias political culture and particularly Carters campaign. The many segregationists who had supported Carter during the race felt betrayed.  Time  magazine ran a story on the  |progressive|Progressivism_In_The_United_States| |_New_South|New_South|  governors elected that year in a May 1971 issue, featuring a cover illustration of Carter. Bourne, pp. 200–201. Hayward, pp. 49–55.       |Lester_Maddox|Lester_Maddox| , Carters predecessor as governor, became  |lieutenant_governor|Lieutenant_Governor_Of_Georgia| . Carter had endorsed Maddox, although the two did not campaign as a  |ticket|Ticket| . The two found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding. Bourne, p. 204.  |Richard_Russell_Jr_|Richard_Russell_Jr_| , then  |President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate|President_Pro_Tempore_Of_The_United_States_Senate| , died in office during Carters second week in office; the newly inaugurated governor appointed  |David_H_Gambrell|David_H_Gambrell| , state Democratic Party chair, to fill Russells unexpired term in the Senate Bourne, pp. 201–202. a week after Russells death on February 1.      Carter was reluctant to engage in back-slapping and political favors, and the legislature found him frustrating to work with. Hayward, pp. 55–56. He looked to aggressively expand the governors authority while reducing the complexity of the state government. Therefore, he negotiated a bill allowing him to propose executive restructuring and to force a vote on it. He implemented  |zero_based_budgeting|Zero_Based_Budgeting|  within state departments and added a Judicial Selection Commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor. Bourne, pp. 204–212. The reorganization plan was submitted in January 1972, but had a cool reception in the legislature. But after two weeks of negotiations, it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session. Bourne, pp. 214–220. Ultimately he merged about 300 state agencies into 22—a fact he would emphasize in his presidential run—although it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so.      In an April 3, 1971 televised appearance, Carter was asked if he was in favor of a requirement that candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Georgia would have to run on the same ticket. He replied, Ive never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and Ive always felt – ever since I was in the state Senate – that the executive branches should be separate. Carter later clarified he would not introduce an amendment to put such a restriction in place.      On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in  |Columbus_Georgia|Columbus_Georgia| , Carter stated his intent to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council that would work toward solving issues within the state ahead of any potential violence.      In a July 13, 1971 news conference, Carter announced his ordering of department heads to reduce spending for the aid of preventing a 57 million deficit by the end of the 1972 fiscal year, specifying that each state department would be impacted and estimating that 5% more than revenue being taken in by the government would be lost if state departments continued full using allocated funds.      On January 13, 1972, Carter requested the state legislature provide funding for an Early Childhood Development Program along with prison reform programs and 48 million in pay taxes for nearly all state employees.      On March 1, 1972, Carter stated a possible usage of a special session of the General Assembly could take place in the event that the Justice Department opted to turn down any reapportionment plans by either the House or Senate.  On April 20, Carter issued the call for a special session for consideration of advisement for the usage of a three person judge federal panel for performance on four judicial reform measures.      In April 1972, Carter traveled to Latin and South America for a potential trade deal with Georgia. Carter stated that he had met with  |President_of_Brazil|President_Of_Brazil| |_Emílio_Garrastazu_Médici|Emílio_Garrastazu_Médici|  and been compared by some to the late President Kennedy.      Civil rights were a heartfelt priority for Carter. He expanded the number of black state employees, judges, and board members. He hired Rita Jackson Samuels, a black woman, to advise him on potential appointments. He placed portraits of Martin Luther King Jr. and two other prominent black Georgians in the capitol building, even as the  |Ku_Klux_Klan|Ku_Klux_Klan|  picketed the unveiling ceremony. Still, Carter tried to keep his conservative allies comfortable. During a televised joint appearance with  |Governor_of_Florida|Governor_Of_Florida| |_Reubin_Askew|Reubin_Askew|  on January 31, 1973, Carter stated he favored a constitutional amendment to ban busing for the purpose of expediting integration in schools.  He co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference, Bourne, pp. 212–213. which Carter also hosted.  After the  |U_S_Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States|  threw out Georgias  |death_penalty|Death_Penalty_In_The_United_States|  statute in  Furman v. Georgia  , Carter signed a revised death-penalty statute which addressed the courts objections, thus re-introducing the practice in the state. Carter later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, I didnt see the injustice of it as I do now.      Carter pushed reforms through the legislature that provided equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia, set up community centers for mentally handicapped children, and increased educational programs for convicts. He took pride in his program for the appointment of judges and state government officials. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit, rather than political influence.       In one of his more controversial decisions,  he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgias  |Flint_River|Flint_River| . After surveying the river and the literature himself, he argued that the  |U_S_Army_Corps_of_Engineers|U_S_Army_Corps_Of_Engineers|  was underestimating both the projects cost and its impact on the region. The veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide. Bourne, pp. 250–251.     When Lieutenant  |William_Calley|William_Calley|  was convicted in a military trial and sentenced to life for his role in the  |My_Lai_Massacre|My_Lai_Massacre|  in  |South_Vietnam|South_Vietnam| , a politically polarizing issue, Carter avoided paying direct tribute to Calley. He instead instituted American Fighting Mans Day and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of the military. Bourne, pp. 213–214.       Under Georgias constitution, Carter was ineligible to run for re-election. Looking toward a potential presidential run, Carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the  |1972_Democratic_National_Convention|1972_Democratic_National_Convention| , where the liberal U.S. Senator  |George_McGovern|George_Mcgovern|  was the likely presidential nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative, anti-McGovern voters, so that the convention would consider him for McGoverns running mate on a compromise ticket. He endorsed Senator  |Henry_Scoop_Jackson|Henry_M_Jackson| , in part to distance himself from George Wallace. Carter was still fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the  |1972_Democratic_ticket|1972_United_States_Presidential_Election|  went to McGovern and Senator  |Thomas_Eagleton|Thomas_Eagleton| . Bourne, pp. 221–230.  On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in  |Birmingham_Alabama|Birmingham_Alabama|  to discuss preventing the Democratic Party from losing in a landslide during the November elections.      After McGoverns loss in November 1972, Carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff. He had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the  |National_Governors_Association|National_Governors_Association|  to boost his visibility. On  |David_Rockefellers|David_Rockefeller|  endorsement he was named to the  |Trilateral_Commission|Trilateral_Commission|  in April 1973. The following year he was named chairman of the  |Democratic_National_Committees|Democratic_National_Committee|  congressional, as well as gubernatorial, campaigns. Bourne, pp. 237–250. In 1973 he appeared on the game show  Whats My Line , where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation. None recognized him and it took several rounds of question-and-answer before movie critic  |Gene_Shalit|Gene_Shalit|  correctly guessed he was a governor. Zelizer, p. 15. In May 1973, Carter warned the Democratic Party against politicizing the  |Watergate_scandal|Watergate_Scandal| ,  the occurrence of which he attributed to President  |Richard_Nixon|Richard_Nixon|  exercising isolation from Americans and secrecy in his decision making.                  On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for  |President_of_the_United_States|President_Of_The_United_States|  at National Press Club in Washington, D.C. His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change.       When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries, he was considered to have little chance against nationally better-known politicians; his  |name_recognition|Name_Recognition|  was two percent. As late as January 26, 1976, Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters, according to a  |Gallup_poll|Gallup_Poll| . Yet by mid-March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, he also led President  |Ford|Gerald_Ford|  by a few percentage points, according to Shoup. Shoup , The Carter Presidency and Beyond As the  |Watergate_scandal|Watergate_Scandal|  of President Nixon was still fresh in the voters minds, Carters position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C., became an asset. He promoted government reorganization. Carter published Why Not the Best? in June 1976 to help introduce himself to the American public.      Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the  |Iowa_caucus|Iowa_Caucus| es and the  |New_Hampshire_primary|New_Hampshire_Primary| . He used a two-prong strategy: in the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabamas  |George_Wallace|George_Wallace| , Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carters strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He had traveled over , visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.  Initially dismissed as a regional candidate,  Carter proved to be the Democrat with the most effective national strategy, and he clinched the nomination.          The national news media discovered and promoted Carter, as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book The Carter Presidency and Beyond     During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter responded to an interviewer and said, I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods.  His remark was intended as supportive of  |open_housing|Housing_Discrimination_In_The_United_States|  laws, but specifying opposition to government efforts to inject black families into a white neighborhood just to create some sort of  |integration|Racial_Integration| .     Carters stated positions during his campaign include public financing of congressional campaigns,  his support for the creation of a federal consumer protection agency,  creating a separate department for education,  signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union against the usage of nuclear weapon,  reducing the defense budget,  a tax proposal implementing a substantial increase toward those who have the higher incomes alongside a levy reduction on taxpayers with lower and middle incomes,  making multiple amendments to the  |Social_Security_Act|Social_Security_Act| ,  and having a balanced budget by the end of his tenure.                On July 15, 1976, Carter chose Minnesota Senator  |Walter_F_Mondale|Walter_Mondale|  as his running mate.  He attacked Washington in his speeches, and offered a religious salve for the nations wounds. American Presidency, Brinkley and Dyer, 2004.     Carter and Gerald Ford faced off in three televised debates during the 1976 election. The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.       Carter was interviewed by  |Robert_Scheer|Robert_Scheer|  of  Playboy  for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election. While discussing his religions view of pride, Carter said: Ive looked on a lot of women with lust. Ive committed adultery in my heart many times. The Playboy Interview: Jimmy Carter. Robert Scheer. Playboy, November 1976, Vol. 23, Iss. 11, pp. 63–86.  This and his admission in another interview that he didnt mind if people uttered the word fuck led to a media feeding frenzy and critics lamenting the erosion of boundary between politicians and their private intimate lives.      Carter began the race with a sizable lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in a narrow defeat on November 2, 1976.  Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297  |electoral_votes|Electoral_College|  to Fords 240. Carter carried fewer states than Ford—23 states to the defeated Fords 27—yet Carter won with the largest percentage of the popular vote of any non-incumbent since  |Dwight_Eisenhower|Dwight_Eisenhower| .          Carters tenure was a time of  |continuing_inflation_and_recession|Early_1980S_Recession_In_The_United_States| , as well as an  |energy_crisis|1979_Energy_Crisis| . Among his first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an  |executive_order|Executive_Order|  declaring unconditional  |amnesty|Amnesty|  for  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War| -era  |draft_evaders|Draft_Evasion| .   On January 7, 1980, Carter signed  known as The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, bailing out  |Chrysler_Corporation|Chrysler|  with $3.5 billion  in aid.      Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the  |Camp_David_Accords|Camp_David_Accords| ;   |giving_back_the_Panama_Canal|Torrijos–Carter_Treaties|  to Panama; and signing the  |SALT_II_nuclear_arms_reduction_treaty|Salt_Ii|  with Soviet leader  |Leonid_Brezhnev|Leonid_Brezhnev| . His final year was marred by the  |Iran_hostage_crisis|Iran_Hostage_Crisis| , which contributed to his losing the  |1980_election|1980_United_States_Presidential_Election|  to  |Ronald_Reagan|Ronald_Reagan| .             On November 22, 1976, Carter conducted his first visit to Washington after being elected, meeting with Director of the Office of Management  |James_Lynn|James_Lynn|  and  |United_States_Secretary_of_Defense|United_States_Secretary_Of_Defense| |_Donald_Rumsfeld|Donald_Rumsfeld|  at the Blair House, and holding an afternoon meeting with President Ford at the White House.  The following day, Carter conferred with congressional leaders, expressing that his meetings with cabinet members had been very helpful and saying Ford had requested he seek out his assistance if needing anything.      On December 3, 1976, during a news conference, Carter announced his choice of  |Cyrus_R_Vance|Cyrus_R_Vance|  for  |United_States_Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State|  and  |Bert_Lance|Bert_Lance|  as his budget director.  On December 9, Carter was presented plans for reform on housing, transportation, and urban development during a meeting with transition advisors at the Blair House.  On December 13, Carters election was confirmed by the Electoral College.  On December 20, Carter announced his choice of  |Juanita_M_Kreps|Juanita_M_Kreps|  for  |United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce|United_States_Secretary_Of_Commerce| ,  |Griffin_Bell|Griffin_Bell|  for  |United_States_Attorney_General|United_States_Attorney_General| , and  |Robert_Bergland|Robert_Bergland|  for  |United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture|United_States_Secretary_Of_Agriculture| .      On January 4, 1977, Carter told reporters that he would free himself from potential conflicts of interest by leaving his peanut business in the hands of trustees.  On January 6, Carter requested former  |Governor_of_Maine|Governor_Of_Maine| |_Kenneth_M_Curtis|Kenneth_M_Curtis|  as Chairman of the  |Democratic_National_Committee|Democratic_National_Committee| .  On January 13, Carter set up an economic summit meeting for non-Communist countries in a call with foreign leaders from Japan, France, Germany, and Great Britain. The conference was set for April.  On January 18, Carter named  |John_F_OLeary|John_F_Oleary|  for Administrator of the  |Federal_Energy_Administration|Federal_Energy_Administration| ,  |William_Nordhaus|William_Nordhaus|  and  |Lyle_E_Gramley|Lyle_E_Gramley|  for membership on the  |Council_of_Economic_Advisors|Council_Of_Economic_Advisors| ,  |Anthony_M_Solomon|Anthony_M_Solomon|  for Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs,  |C_Fred_Bergsten|C_Fred_Bergsten|  for Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, and  |Kenneth_S_Axelson|Kenneth_S_Axelson|  for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.          On April 18, 1977, Carter delivered a televised speech declaring that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was the  |moral_equivalent_of_war|President_Jimmy_Carters_Moral_Equivalent_Of_War_Speech| . He encouraged energy conservation by all U.S. citizens and installed  |solar_water_heating_panels_on_the_White_House|White_House_Solar_Panels| .   He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House. Craig Shirley, . October 8, 2010, Fox News. On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the  |Department_of_Energy_Organization_Act_of_1977|Department_Of_Energy_Organization_Act_Of_1977| , forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years.  During the signing ceremony, Carter cited the impending crisis of energy shortages with causing the necessity of the legislation.  At the start of a September 29, 1977 news conference, under the impression he had not come across well in addressing energy during his prior press session, Carter stated that the House of Representatives had adopted almost all of the energy proposal he had made five months prior and called the compromise a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.  The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senates ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.           On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had been long and divisive and arduous as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.    In an April 11, 1978 news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise in the nature of a disappointment since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.      On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress.  On April 5, he delivered an address in which he stressed the urgency of energy conservation.  During an April 30 news conference, Carter said it was imperative that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed.  On July 15, 1979, Carter delivered a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a  |crisis_of_confidence|S_The_Crisis_Of_Confidence|  among the American people,  under the advisement of pollster  |Pat_Caddell|Pat_Caddell|  who believed Americans faced a crisis in confidence from events of the 1960s and 1970s prior to Carter taking office.  The address would be cited as Carters  |malaise|Malaise|  speech, memorable for mixed reactions   and his use of rhetoric.  The speechs negative reception came from a view that Carter did not state efforts on his own part to address the energy crisis and was too reliant on Americans.        In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of  |Love_Canal|Love_Canal|  in the city of  |Niagara_Falls_New_York|Niagara_Falls_New_York| . More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a  |toxic_waste|Toxic_Waste|  landfill. The  |Superfund|Superfund|  law was created in response to the situation. Robert W. Kolb, . SAGE Publications, 2008. Page 1305 Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which were built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes. This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more Love Canals existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era . Paul E. Rosenfeld and Lydia Feng, . William Andrew, 2011.       Carter refused to play by Washingtons rules. Zelizer, pp. 53-55 He missed and never returned phone calls on his part. He used verbal insults and had an unwillingness to return political favors, which contributed to his lack of ability to pass legislation through Congress.  During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was inevitable that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found a growing sense of cooperation with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties.  Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects,  which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party.  As a rift ensued between the White House and Congress afterward, Carter noted the liberal wing of the Democratic Party was the most ardently against his policies, attributing this to Ted Kennedy wanting the presidency. Carter, Jimmy Our Endangered Values: Americas Moral Crisis, p. 8, , Simon & Schuster Carter, thinking he had support from 74 Congressmen, issued a hit list of 19 projects that he claimed were pork barrel spending that he claimed would result in a veto on his part if included in any legislation.  He found himself at odds with Congressional Democrats once more,  |Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives|Speaker_Of_The_United_States_House_Of_Representatives| |_Tip_ONeill|Tip_Oneill|  finding it inappropriate for a president to pursue what had traditionally been the role of Congress. Carter was also weakened by a signing of bill that contained many of the hit list projects.  In a June 23, 1977 address to a fundraising dinner for the  |Democratic_National_Committee|Democratic_National_Committee| , Carter said, I think its good to point out tonight, too, that we have evolved a good working relationship with the Congress. For 8 years we had government by partisanship. Now we have government by partnership.  At a July 28 news conference, assessing the first six months of his presidency, Carter spoke of his improved understanding of Congress: I have learned to respect the Congress more in an individual basis. Ive been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual Members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where theyve been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do.      On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan. The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government due to the vote and concluding the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation. He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on local or parochial interests and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.  Carters remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks. Others pointed to 106 Democrats voting against his proposal and the bipartisan criticism potentially coming back to haunt him.  At the start of a July 25, 1979 news conference, Carter called on believers in the future of the US and his proposed energy program to speak with Congress as it bore the responsibility to impose his proposals.  Amid the energy proposal opposition, The New York Times commented that as the comments flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue illustrate, there is also a crisis of confidence between Congress and the President, sense of doubt and distrust that threatens to undermine the Presidents legislative program and become an important issue in next years campaign.        Carters presidency had an economic history of two roughly equal periods, the first two years being a time of continuing recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession, which had left fixed investment at its lowest level since the 1970 recession and unemployment at 9%,  and the last two years marked by double-digit inflation, coupled with very high interest rates, Frum, p. 292 oil shortages, and slow economic growth.  Following a period of growth in 1977 and 1978 that saw the creation of million net new jobs  and real median household income growth by 5%,  the  |1979_energy_crisis|1979_Energy_Crisis|  ended this period of growth, however, and as both inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation, and  |consumer_confidence|Consumer_Confidence|  declined sharply. The relatively loose  |monetary_policy|Monetary_Policy|  adopted by  |Federal_Reserve_Board|Federal_Reserve_Board|  Chairman  |G_William_Miller|G_William_Miller| , had already contributed to somewhat higher  |inflation|Inflation| ,  rising from 5.8% in 1976 to 7.7% in 1978. The sudden doubling of  |crude_oil|Crude_Oil|  prices by  |OPEC|Opec| , the worlds leading oil exporting  |cartel|Cartel| ,  forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980. The sudden shortage of  |gasoline|Gasoline|  as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem, and would come to symbolize the crisis among the public in general; the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of  |Amerada_Hess|Amerada_Hess|  refining facilities, led to a lawsuit against the company that year by the Federal Government.             In 1977, Carter appointed  |Alfred_E_Kahn|Alfred_E_Kahn|  to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board . He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform , the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.      Carter signed the  |Airline_Deregulation_Act|Airline_Deregulation_Act|  into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to  |remove_government_control|Airline_Deregulation|  over fares, routes and market entry from  |commercial_aviation|Commercial_Aviation| . The  |Civil_Aeronautics_Boards|Civil_Aeronautics_Board|  powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAAs regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.      In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell  |malt|Malt| ,  |hops|Hops| , and  |yeast|Yeast|  to American  |home_brewers|Homebrewing|  for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of  |Prohibition_in_the_United_States|Prohibition_In_The_United_States| .  This Carter deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft  |microbrew|Microbrewery|  culture in the United States, with 6,266 micro breweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2017.        During his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the  |Ted_Kennedy|Ted_Kennedy| -sponsored bipartisan  |universal|Universal_Health_Care| |_national_health_insurance|National_Health_Insurance| .        Carters proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,  and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage.  Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage made by President  |Harry_Truman|Harry_Truman|  in the latters proposed access to quality health care being a basic right to Americans and  |Medicare|Medicare|  and  |Medicaid|Medicaid|  being introduced under President  |Lyndon_B_Johnson|Lyndon_B_Johnson| .   The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate,  and later defeated in the House.      During 1978, Carter also conducted meetings with Kennedy for a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful.  Carter would later cite Kennedys disagreements as having thwarted Carters efforts to provide a comprehensive health-care system for the country.        Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to assist in fulfilling a campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In a February 28, 1978 address at the White House, Carter argued, Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various Government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.  On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.  On October 17, 1979, Carter signed the  |Department_of_Education_Organization_Act|Department_Of_Education_Organization_Act|  into law,  establishing the  |United_States_Department_of_Education|United_States_Department_Of_Education| .      Carter expanded the  |Head_Start|Head_Start|  program with the addition of 43,000 children and families,  while the percentage of nondefense dollars spent on education was doubled.  Carter was complimentary of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson and the  |89th_United_States_Congress|89Th_United_States_Congress|  for having initiated Head Start.  In a November 1, 1980 speech, Carter stated his administration had extended Head Start to migrant children and was working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in Federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally .                     Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he:   :was in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional US policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, side-line the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.
