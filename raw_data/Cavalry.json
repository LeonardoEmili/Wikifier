The relatively low ratio of horsemen to infantry does not mean that the utility of cavalry should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory.

Since at least the 3rd century BC, there was influence of northern nomad ic peoples and Yemaek peoples on Korean warfare. By roughly the first century BC, the ancient kingdom of Buyeo also had mounted warriors. Ebrey, 120. The cavalry of Goguryeo , one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea , were called Gaemamusa , and were renowned as a fearsome heavy cavalry force. King Gwanggaeto the Great often led expeditions into the Baekje , Gaya confederacy , Buyeo , Later Yan and against Japanese invaders with his cavalry. Lee, Peter H & Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition, pp. 24–26. Columbia University Press, 1997.   In the 12th century, Jurchen tribes began to violate the Goryeo–Jurchen borders, and eventually invaded Goryeo Korea. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general Yun Gwan realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo–Jurchen borders . thu with bow and arrows, wearing a horned helmet. Circa 1878.     The ancient Japanese of the Kofun period also adopted cavalry and equine culture by the 5th century AD. The emergence of the samurai aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging lancer cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.     An example is Yabusame , a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special turnip-headed arrows successively at three wooden targets.     This style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.   Currently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto . It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.     Kasagake or Kasakake is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.       In the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the Gupta Dynasty period onwards. India has also the oldest evidence for the introduction of toe- stirrup s.     Indian literature contains numerous references to the cavalry forces of the Central Asia n horse nomads like the Saka s, Kambojas , Yavanas , Pahlavas and Paradas . Numerous Puranic texts refer to a conflict in ancient India pp. 182–183, Pargiter. in which the cavalry forces of five nations, called five hordes  or Kṣatriya hordes , attacked and captured the throne of Ayudhya by dethroning its Vedic King Bahu Harivamsa 14.1–19; Vayu Purana 88.127–43; Brahma Purana ; Brahamanda Purana ; Shiva Purana ; Vishnu Purana , Padama Purana etc.     thu     The Mahabharata , Ramayana , numerous Puranas and some foreign sources numerously attest that Kamboja cavalry was frequently requisitioned in ancient wars. V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar writes: Both the Puranas and the epics agree that the horses of the Sindhu and Kamboja regions were of the finest breed, and that the services of the Kambojas as cavalry troopers were requisitioned in ancient wars .
