For the  |2008_film_version_of_Mamma_Mia!|Mamma_Mia!|  and its 2018 sequel,  Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again , he worked also as an executive producer. Since 2001, he has been active with his own band  |Benny_Anderssons_orkester|Benny_Anderssons_Orkester| .       Göran Bror Benny Andersson was born in the  |Vasastan|Vasastan,_Stockholm|  district of  |Stockholm|Stockholm| , to civil engineer Gösta Andersson and his wife Laila . His sister Eva-Lis Andersson followed in 1948. Anderssons musical background comes from his father and grandfather; they both enjoyed playing the  |accordion|Accordion| , and at six, Benny got his own. His father Gösta and grandfather Efraim taught him Swedish  |folk_music|Folk_Music| ,  |traditional_music|Traditional_Music| , and  |schlager|Schlager| . Benny recalls the first records he bought were Du Bist Musik by Italian schlager singer  |Caterina_Valente|Caterina_Valente|  and  |Elvis_Presleys|Elvis_Presley| |Jailhouse_Rock|Jailhouse_Rock|  . He was especially impressed by the flip side Treat Me Nice as this featured a piano. This variety of different kinds of music was to influence and follow him through the years.     When Andersson was ten he got his own piano, and taught himself to play. He left school aged 15 and began to perform at youth clubs. This is when he met his first girlfriend Christina Grönvall, with whom he had two children: Peter and Heléne . In early 1964, Benny and Christina joined Elverkets Spelmanslag , the name was a punning reference to their electric instruments. The repertoire was mainly instrumentals, one of his numbers was  |Baby_Elephant_Walk|Baby_Elephant_Walk|  , and he wrote his first songs.         In October 1964 he joined the  |Hep_Stars|Hep_Stars|  as keyboardist and they made a breakthrough in March 1965 with their hit Cadillac , eventually becoming the most celebrated of the Swedish 1960s pop bands. Andersson consolidated his place as the bands keyboardist and musical driving force as well as a teen idol. The band performed mostly covers of international hits, but Andersson soon started writing his own material, and gave the band the classic hits No Response , Sunny Girl , Wedding , Consolation , Its Nice To Be Back and She Will Love You amongst others.       Andersson met  |Björn_Ulvaeus|Björn_Ulvaeus|  in June 1966, and the two started writing songs together, their first being Isnt It Easy To Say , eventually recorded by the Hep Stars. He also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with  |Lasse_Berghagen|Lasse_Berghagen| , with whom he wrote several songs and submitted Hej, Clown for the 1969  |Melodifestivalen|Melodifestivalen|  – the Swedish  |Eurovision_Song_Festival|Eurovision_Song_Festival|  finals. The song finished in second place. During this contest he met vocalist  |Anni-Frid_Lyngstad|Anni-Frid_Lyngstad| , and they soon became a couple. Around the same time his songwriting companion Ulvaeus met vocalist  |Agnetha_Fältskog|Agnetha_Fältskog| .     The personal relationships and Andersson and Ulvaeus songwriting collaboration has led quite naturally to the very close co-operation which the four friends had during the following years. Benny and Björn scored their first hits as songwriters in the spring of 1969:  |Ljuva_sextital|Ljuva_Sextital|  and Speleman . As the two couples began supporting each other during recording sessions, the sound of the girls voices convinced the songwriters to model their group on various  |MOR|Middle_Of_The_Road|  acts such as  |Blue_Mink|Blue_Mink| ,  |Middle_of_the_Road|Middle_Of_The_Road|  and  |Sweet|The_Sweet| . Thus,  |ABBA|Abba|  came to life.             The groups breakthrough came with winning the  |Eurovision_Song_Contest|Eurovision_Song_Contest|  for Sweden with  |Waterloo|Waterloo|  on 6 April 1974. During the next eight years, Andersson wrote music for and produced eight studio albums with ABBA. The group achieved great success globally and scored a chain of No. 1 hits.     Chess, Kristina and Mamma Mia!  |stage_musical|Stage_Musical|   Chess , written with  |Tim_Rice|Tim_Rice| .

The Paige/Dickson duet  |I_Know_Him_So_Well|I_Know_Him_So_Well|  became a major UK No. 1 hit, and Murray Heads  |One_Night_in_Bangkok|One_Night_In_Bangkok|  gave Andersson/Ulvaeus a US No. 3 hit.     Chess was staged in Londons West End  |Prince_Edward_Theatre|Prince_Edward_Theatre|  in May 1986 and received mixed to positive reviews, running for about three years. A revised staging on Broadway in April 1988 received poor reviews, running for two months.     In 1985, Andersson produced and released an album with brother and sister  |Anders|Anders_Glenmark|  and  |Karin_Glenmark|Karin_Glenmark| , featuring new songs by Andersson/Ulvaeus. The duo named themselves  |Gemini|Gemini| , and a second album with more music by Björn and Benny was released in April 1987, containing the big hit  |Mio_My_Mio|Mio_My_Mio|  ; also to be found on the soundtrack to the film  Mio in the Land of Faraway , for which Andersson co-produced the music.     In 1987, Andersson released his first solo album Klinga Mina Klockor . All the music was written by and performed by himself on accordion, backed by the  Orsa Spelmän  on fiddles. A second solo album followed: November 1989.     In 1990, Andersson scored a Swedish No. 1 hit with Lassie , sung by female cabaret group  |Ainbusk|Ainbusk| , for whom he also wrote the  |Svensktoppen|Svensktoppen|  hits Älska Mig and Drömmarnas Golv . He decided to produce an album with  |Josefin_Nilsson|Josefin_Nilsson|  from this quartet, resulting in the 1993 English-language album Shapes, featuring ten new Andersson/Ulvaeus compositions.     In 1992, he wrote the introduction melody for the European football championship, which was organised by Sweden that year.     From the late 1980s, Andersson had worked on an idea for an epic Swedish language musical based on his affection for traditional folk music, and in October 1995,  Kristina från Duvemåla  premiered in Sweden. The musical was based on  The Emigrants  novels by Swedish writer  |Vilhelm_Moberg|Vilhelm_Moberg| . The musical ran successfully for almost five years, before closing in June 1999. An English-language version, simply titled Kristina, was staged in concert at  |Carnegie_Hall|Carnegie_Hall|  in New York City for two nights in September 2009, yielding a live recording, and at the  |Royal_Albert_Hall|Royal_Albert_Hall|  for one night in April 2010.     Anderssons next project was  Mamma Mia! , a musical built around 24 of ABBAs songs, which has become a worldwide box-office blockbuster, with versions in several languages being played in many countries, including the UK , Canada , the USA , and Sweden .     For the 2004 semi-final of the  |Eurovision_Song_Contest|Eurovision_Song_Contest| , staged in Istanbul thirty years after  |ABBA|Abba|  had won the contest in Brighton, Benny appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled Our Last Video .

The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split; however, Fridas appearance was filmed separately.     A film version of  Mamma Mia!  premiered on 18 July 2008. In April/May 2007, Andersson worked on the film soundtrack, re-recording the ABBA songs with musicians from the original ABBA recording sessions.  Mamma Mia! The Movie  has become the most successful film musical of all time, and the biggest-selling DVD ever in the UK.          Andersson currently performs with his own band of 16 musicians,  |Benny_Anderssons_Orkester|Benny_Anderssons_Orkester|  , with fellow Swedes  |Helen_Sjöholm|Helen_Sjöholm|   and  |Tommy_Körberg|Tommy_Körberg|  , with lyrics to new material sometimes written by  |Björn_Ulvaeus|Björn_Ulvaeus| . BAO has released five albums to huge success in Sweden, all containing hit singles.

For a compilation album of the Glenmark duo  |Gemini|Gemini| , Andersson had Björn Ulvaeus write new Swedish lyrics for the re-recording of two songs from 1984 and 1987.

During his acceptance speech he reflected on the important influence of traditional European music and the melancholy of the Swedish soul on ABBAs brand of pop music. If you live in a country like Sweden, with five, six months of snow, and the sun disappears totally for like two months, that would be reflected in the work of artists, he said. Its definitely in the Swedish folk music, you can hear it in the Russian folk songs, you can hear in the music from Jean Sibelius or Edvard Grieg from Norway, you can see it in the eyes of Greta Garbo and you can hear it in the voice of Jussi Björling. And you can hear in the sound of Frida and Agnetha on some of our songs too.
