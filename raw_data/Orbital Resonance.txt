        In  |celestial_mechanics|Celestial_Mechanics| , orbital resonance occurs when  |orbit|Orbit| ing bodies exert regular, periodic  |gravitational|Gravitational|  influence on each other, usually because their  |orbital_periods|Orbital_Period|  are related by a ratio of small  |integers|Integer| . Most commonly this relationship is found for a pair of objects. The physical principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a  |swing|Swing| , where the orbit and the swing both have a  |natural_frequency|Natural_Frequency| , and the other body doing the pushing will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.e., their ability to alter or constrain each others orbits. In most cases, this results in an unstable interaction, in which the bodies exchange  |momentum|Momentum|  and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of  |Jupiters|Jupiter|  moons  |Ganymede|Ganymede| ,  |Europa|Europa|  and  |Io|Io| , and the 2:3 resonance between  |Pluto|Pluto|  and  |Neptune|Neptune| . Unstable resonances with  |Saturns|Saturn|  inner moons give rise to gaps in the  |rings_of_Saturn|Rings_Of_Saturn| . The special case of 1:1 resonance between bodies with similar orbital radii causes large  |Solar_System|Solar_System|  bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits; this is part of the much more extensive process of  |clearing_the_neighbourhood|Clearing_The_Neighbourhood| , an effect that is used in the current  |definition_of_a_planet|Definition_Of_Planet| .     A binary resonance ratio in this article should be interpreted as the ratio of number of orbits completed in the same time interval, rather than as the ratio of orbital periods, which would be the inverse ratio. Thus the 2:3 ratio above means Pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes Neptune to complete three. In the case of resonance relationships among three or more bodies, either type of ratio may be used and the type of ratio will be specified.       Since the discovery of  |Newtons_law_of_universal_gravitation|Newtons_Law_Of_Universal_Gravitation|  in the 17th century, the  |stability_of_the_Solar_System|Stability_Of_The_Solar_System|  has preoccupied many mathematicians, starting with  |Pierre-Simon_Laplace|Pierre-Simon_Laplace| . The stable orbits that arise in a  |two-body_approximation|N-Body_Problem|  ignore the influence of other bodies. The effect of these added interactions on the stability of the  |Solar_System|Solar_System|  is very small, but at first it was not known whether they might add up over longer periods to significantly change the orbital parameters and lead to a completely different configuration, or whether some other stabilising effects might maintain the configuration of the orbits of the planets.     It was Laplace who found the first answers explaining the linked orbits of the  |Galilean_moons|Galilean_Moon|  . Before Newton, there was also consideration of ratios and proportions in orbital motions, in what was called the music of the spheres , or  |Musica_universalis|Musica_Universalis| .                        In general, an orbital resonance may   involve one or any combination of the orbit parameters .   act on any time scale from short term, commensurable with the orbit periods, to  |secular|Secular_Phenomena| , measured in 10 4 to 10 6 years.   lead to either long-term stabilization of the orbits or be the cause of their destabilization.     A mean-motion orbital resonance occurs when two bodies have periods of  |revolution|Orbit|  that are a simple integer ratio of each other. Depending on the details, this can either stabilize or destabilize the orbit.   Stabilization may occur when the two bodies move in such a synchronised fashion that they never closely approach. For instance:   The orbits of  |Pluto|Pluto|  and the  |plutinos|Plutino|  are stable, despite crossing that of the much larger  |Neptune|Neptune| , because they are in a 2:3 resonance with it. The resonance ensures that, when they approach perihelion and Neptunes orbit, Neptune is consistently distant . Other Neptune-crossing bodies that were not in resonance were ejected from that region by strong  |perturbations|Perturbation|  due to Neptune. There are also smaller but significant groups of  |resonant_trans-Neptunian_objects|Resonant_Trans-Neptunian_Object|  occupying the 1:1 ,  |3:5|Resonant_Kuiper_Belt_Object3:5_Resonance| ,  |4:7|Resonant_Kuiper_Belt_Object4:7_Resonance| , 1:2  and  |2:5|Resonant_Kuiper_Belt_Object2:5_Resonance|  resonances, among others, with respect to Neptune.   In the  |asteroid_belt|Asteroid_Belt|  beyond 3.5 AU from the Sun, the 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1 resonances with  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  are populated by clumps of asteroids .     Orbital resonances can also destabilize one of the orbits. This process can be exploited to find energy-efficient ways of  |deorbit|Deorbit| ing spacecraft.   For small bodies, destabilization is actually far more likely. For instance:   In the  |asteroid_belt|Asteroid_Belt|  within 3.5 AU from the Sun, the major mean-motion resonances with  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  are locations of gaps in the asteroid distribution, the  |Kirkwood_gaps|Kirkwood_Gap|  .  |Asteroids|Asteroid|  have been ejected from these almost empty lanes by repeated perturbations. However, there are still populations of asteroids temporarily present in or near these resonances. For example, asteroids of the  |Alinda_family|Alinda_Family|  are in or close to the 3:1 resonance, with their orbital eccentricity steadily increased by interactions with Jupiter until they eventually have a close encounter with an inner planet that ejects them from the resonance.   In the  |rings_of_Saturn|Rings_Of_Saturn| , the  |Cassini_Division|Rings_Of_Saturncassini_Division|  is a gap between the inner  |B_Ring|Rings_Of_Saturnb_Ring|  and the outer  |A_Ring|Rings_Of_Saturna_Ring|  that has been cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon  |Mimas|Mimas| .    In the rings of Saturn, the  |Encke|Rings_Of_Saturnencke_Gap|  and  |Keeler|Rings_Of_Saturnkeeler_Gap|  gaps within the A Ring are cleared by 1:1 resonances with the embedded moonlets  |Pan|Pan|  and  |Daphnis|Daphnis| , respectively. The A Rings outer edge is maintained by a destabilizing 7:6 resonance with the moon  |Janus|Janus| .     Most bodies that are in resonance orbit in the same direction; however, the  |retrograde|Retrograde_Motion|  asteroid  |514107_Kaʻepaokaʻawela|514107_KaʻEpaokaʻAwela|  appears to be in a stable 1:−1 resonance with Jupiter.  In addition, a few retrograde  |damocloids|Damocloid_Asteroid|  have been found that are temporarily captured in mean-motion resonance with  |Jupiter|Jupiter|  or  |Saturn|Saturn| .  Such orbital interactions are weaker than the corresponding interactions between bodies orbiting in the same direction.     A Laplace resonance is a three-body resonance with a 1:2:4 orbital period ratio . The term arose because  |Pierre-Simon_Laplace|Pierre-Simon_Laplace|  discovered that such a resonance governed the motions of Jupiters moons  |Io|Io| ,  |Europa|Europa| , and  |Ganymede|Ganymede| . It is now also often applied to other 3-body resonances with the same ratios,    such as that between the  |extrasolar_planets|Extrasolar_Planet| |Gliese_876|Gliese_876|  c, b, and e.    Three-body resonances involving other simple integer ratios have been termed Laplace-like or Laplace-type .        A  Lindblad resonance  drives  |spiral_density_waves|Density_Wave_Theory|  both in  |galaxies|Galaxies|   and in  |Saturns_rings|Rings_Of_Saturn|  .     A  secular resonance  occurs when the  |precession|Precessionastronomy|  of two orbits is synchronised . A small body in secular resonance with a much larger one  will precess at the same rate as the large body. Over long times a secular resonance will change the  |eccentricity|Eccentricity|  and  |inclination|Inclination|  of the small body.     Several prominent examples of secular resonance involve Saturn. A resonance between the precession of Saturns rotational axis and that of Neptunes orbital axis has been identified as the likely source of Saturns large  |axial_tilt|Axial_Tilt|  .        Initially, Saturn probably had a tilt closer to that of Jupiter . The gradual depletion of the Kuiper belt would have decreased the precession rate of Neptunes orbit; eventually, the frequencies matched, and Saturns axial precession was captured into the spin-orbit resonance, leading to an increase in Saturns obliquity.     The  |perihelion_secular_resonance|Secular_Resonance?6_Resonance|  between  |asteroids|Asteroid|  and  |Saturn|Saturn|   helps shape the asteroid belt . Asteroids which approach it have their eccentricity slowly increased until they become  |Mars-crossers|Mars-Crossing_Asteroid| , at which point they are usually ejected from the  |asteroid_belt|Asteroid_Belt|  by a close pass to  |Mars|Mars| . This resonance forms the inner and side boundaries of the  |asteroid_belt|Asteroid_Belt|  around 2  |AU|Astronomical_Unit| , and at  |inclinations|Inclination|  of about 20°.     Numerical simulations have suggested that the eventual formation of a perihelion secular resonance between  |Mercury|Mercury|  and Jupiter  has the potential to greatly increase Mercurys eccentricity and possibly destabilize the inner Solar System several billion years from now.           The  |Titan_Ringlet|Rings_Of_Saturncolombo_Gap_And_Titan_Ringlet|  within Saturns  |C_Ring|Rings_Of_Saturnc_Ring|  represents another type of resonance in which the rate of  |apsidal_precession|Apsidal_Precession|  of one orbit exactly matches the speed of revolution of another. The outer end of this eccentric ringlet always points towards Saturns major moon  |Titan|Titan| .        A  Kozai resonance  occurs when the inclination and eccentricity of a  |perturbed|Perturbation_Theory|  orbit oscillate synchronously . This resonance applies only to bodies on highly inclined orbits; as a consequence, such orbits tend to be unstable, since the growing eccentricity would result in small  |pericenters|Apsis| , typically leading to a collision or destruction by  |tidal_forces|Tidal_Forces| .     In an example of another type of resonance involving orbital eccentricity, the eccentricities of Ganymede and Callisto vary with a common period of 181 years, although with opposite phases.                 There are only a few known mean-motion resonances in the  |Solar_System|Solar_System|  involving planets,  |dwarf_planets|Dwarf_Planet|  or larger  |satellites|Natural_Satellite|  .   2:3  |Pluto|Pluto| – |Neptune|Neptune|     2:4  |Tethys|Tethys| – |Mimas|Mimas|  . Not simplified, because the libration of the nodes must be taken into account.   1:2  |Dione|Dione| – |Enceladus|Enceladus|    3:4  |Hyperion|Hyperion| – |Titan|Titan|    1:2:4  |Ganymede|Ganymede| – |Europa|Europa| – |Io|Io|  .     Additionally,  |Haumea|Haumea|  is believed to be in a 7:12 resonance with Neptune,       and  is believed to be in a 3:10 resonance with Neptune.        The simple integer ratios between periods hide more complex relations:   the point of  |conjunction|Astronomical_Conjunction|  can oscillate  around an equilibrium point defined by the resonance.   given non-zero  |eccentricities|Eccentricity| , the  |nodes|Orbital_Node|  or  |periapsides|Perihelion|  can drift .     As illustration of the latter, consider the well-known 2:1 resonance of Io-Europa. If the orbiting periods were in this relation, the  |mean_motions|Mean_Motion|  n  would satisfy the following     : n - 2  n0     Substituting the data one will get −0.7395° day −1 , a value substantially different from zero.     Actually, the resonance  perfect, but it involves also the precession of  |perijove|Perihelion|  ,   . The correct equation is:     : n - 2  n +       In other words, the mean motion of Io is indeed double of that of Europa taking into account the precession of the perijove. An observer sitting on the perijove will see the moons coming into conjunction in the same place . The other pairs listed above satisfy the same type of equation with the exception of Mimas-Tethys resonance. In this case, the resonance satisfies the equation     : 4  n - 2  n -         The point of conjunctions librates around the midpoint between the  |nodes|Orbital_Node|  of the two moons.          The Laplace resonance involving Io–Europa–Ganymede includes the following relation locking the orbital phase of the moons:     :   - 3  + 2      where   are  |mean_longitudes|Mean_Longitude|  of the moons .     This relation makes a triple conjunction impossible.  The graph illustrates the positions of the moons after 1, 2 and 3 Io periods.   librates about 180° with an amplitude of 0.03°.        Another Laplace-like resonance involves the  |moons|Moons_Of_Pluto| |Styx|Styx| ,  |Nix|Nix|  and  |Hydra|Hydra|  of Pluto:        :   - 5  + 2      This reflects orbital periods for Styx, Nix and Hydra, respectively, that are close to a ratio of 18:22:33 ; the respective ratio of orbits is 11:9:6. Based on the ratios of  |synodic_periods|Synodic_Period| , there are 5 conjunctions of Styx and Hydra and 3 conjunctions of Nix and Hydra for every 2 conjunctions of Styx and Nix.    As with the Galilean satellite resonance, triple conjunctions are forbidden.   librates about 180° with an amplitude of at least 10°.              The dwarf planet  |Pluto|Pluto|  is following an orbit trapped in a web of resonances with  |Neptune|Neptune| . The resonances include:   A mean-motion resonance of 2:3   The resonance of the  |perihelion|Perihelion|  , keeping the perihelion above the  |ecliptic|Ecliptic| |Uranus|Uranus|  is just 11 AU    .     The next largest body in a similar 2:3 resonance with Neptune, called a  plutino , is the probable dwarf planet  |Orcus|90482_Orcus| . Orcus has an orbit similar in inclination and eccentricity to Plutos. However, the two are constrained by their mutual resonance with Neptune to always be in opposite phases of their orbits; Orcus is thus sometimes described as the anti-Pluto .          While most  |extrasolar_planet|Extrasolar_Planet| ary systems discovered have not been found to have planets in mean-motion resonances, chains of up to five resonant planets and up to seven at least near resonant planets have been uncovered. Simulations have shown that during  |planetary_system_formation|Nebular_Hypothesis| , the appearance of resonant chains of planetary embryos is favored by the presence of the  |primordial_gas_disc|Protoplanetary_Disk| . Once that gas dissipates, 90–95% of those chains must then become unstable to match the low frequency of resonant chains observed.    As mentioned above,  |Gliese_876e|Gliese_876| , b and c are in a Laplace resonance, with a 4:2:1 ratio of periods .          In this case,   librates with an amplitude of 40° ± 13° and the resonance follows the time-averaged relation:   :   - 3  + 2     |Kepler-223|Kepler-223|  has four planets in a resonance with an 8:6:4:3 orbit ratio, and a 3:4:6:8 ratio of periods .           This represents the first confirmed 4-body orbital resonance.  The librations within this system are such that close encounters between two planets occur only when the other planets are in distant parts of their orbits. Simulations indicate that this system of resonances must have formed via  |planetary_migration|Planetary_Migration| .    |Kepler-80|Kepler-80|  d, e, b, c and g have periods in a ~ 1.000: 1.512: 2.296: 3.100: 4.767 ratio . However, in a frame of reference that rotates with the conjunctions, this reduces to a period ratio of 4:6:9:12:18 . Conjunctions of d and e, e and b, b and c, and c and g occur at relative intervals of 2:3:6:6 in a pattern that repeats about every 190.5 days in the inertial or nonrotating frame . Librations of possible three-body resonances have amplitudes of only about 3 degrees, and modeling indicates the resonant system is stable to perturbations. Triple conjunctions do not occur.      |Kepler-29|Kepler-29|  has a pair of planets in a 7:9 resonance .    |Kepler-36|Kepler-36|  has a pair of planets close to a 6:7 resonance.     |Kepler-37|Kepler-37|  d, c and b are within one percent of a resonance with an 8:15:24 orbit ratio and a 15:8:5 ratio of periods .      :And    Of  |Kepler-90s|Kepler-90|  eight known planets, the period ratios b:c, c:i and i:d are close to 4:5, 3:5 and 1:4, respectively and d, e, f, g and h are close to a 2:3:4:7:11 period ratio .  f, g and h are also close to a 3:5:8 period ratio .  Relevant to systems like this and that of  |Kepler-36|Kepler-36| , calculations suggest that the presence of an outer gas giant planet facilitates the formation of closely packed resonances among inner super-Earths.     |HD_41248|Hd_41248|  has a pair of  |super-Earths|Super-Earth|  within 0.3% of a 5:7 resonance .       |TRAPPIST-1s|Trappist-1|  seven approximately Earth-sized planets are in a chain of near resonances , having an orbit ratio of approximately 24, 15, 9, 6, 4, 3 and 2, or nearest-neighbor period ratios of about 8/5, 5/3, 3/2, 3/2, 4/3 and 3/2 . They are also configured such that each triple of adjacent planets is in a Laplace resonance .   The resonant configuration is expected to be stable on a time scale of billions of years, assuming it arose during planetary migration.   A musical interpretation of the resonance has been provided.    |K2-138|K2-138|  has 5 confirmed planets in an unbroken near-3:2 resonance chain . The system was discovered in the  |citizen_science|Citizen_Science|  project Exoplanet Explorers, using K2 data.  K2-138 could host  |co-orbital_bodies|Co-Orbital_Configuration|  .  Resonant chain systems can stabilize co-orbital bodies  and a dedicated analysis of the K2 light curve and radial-velocity from  |HARPS|High_Accuracy_Radial_Velocity_Planet_Searcher|  might reveal them. Follow-up observations with the  |Spitzer_Space_Telescope|Spitzer_Space_Telescope|  suggest a sixth planet continuing the 3:2 resonance chain, while leaving two gaps in the chain . These gaps could be filled by smaller non-transiting planets.   Future observations with  |CHEOPS|Cheops|  will measure  |transit-timing_variations|Transit-Timing_Variation|  of the system to further analyse the mass of the planets and could potentially find other planetary bodies in the system.      Cases of extrasolar planets close to a 1:2 mean-motion resonance are fairly common. Sixteen percent of systems found by the  |transit_method|Transit_Method|  are reported to have an example of this , as well as one sixth of planetary systems characterized by  |Doppler_spectroscopy|Doppler_Spectroscopy|  . Due to incomplete knowledge of the systems, the actual proportions are likely to be higher. Overall, about a third of radial velocity characterized systems appear to have a pair of planets close to a  |commensurability|Commensurability| .    It is much more common for pairs of planets to have orbital period ratios a few percent larger than a mean-motion resonance ratio than a few percent smaller . This was predicted to be true in cases where  |tidal_interactions|Tidal_Acceleration|  with the star are significant.                     A number of near- |integer|Integer| -ratio relationships between the orbital frequencies of the planets or major moons are sometimes pointed out . However, these have no dynamical significance because there is no appropriate precession of  |perihelion|Perihelion|  or other libration to make the resonance perfect . Such near resonances are dynamically insignificant even if the mismatch is quite small because , after each cycle the relative position of the bodies shifts. When averaged over astronomically short timescales, their relative position is random, just like bodies that are nowhere near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth and Venus, which arrive at almost the same configuration after 8 Earth orbits and 13 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, which is only 0.032% away from exactly 8:13. The mismatch after 8 years is only 1.5° of Venus orbital movement. Still, this is enough that Venus and Earth find themselves in the opposite relative orientation to the original every 120 such cycles, which is 960 years. Therefore, on timescales of thousands of years or more , their relative position is effectively random.     The presence of a near resonance may reflect that a perfect resonance existed in the past, or that the system is evolving towards one in the future.     Some orbital frequency coincidences include:             The least probable orbital correlation in the list is that between Io and Metis, followed by those between Rosalind and Cordelia, Pallas and Ceres, Jupiter and Pallas, Callisto and Ganymede, and Hydra and Charon, respectively.         A past resonance between Jupiter and Saturn may have played a dramatic role in early Solar System history. A 2004  |computer_model|Nice_Model|  by  |Alessandro_Morbidelli|Alessandro_Morbidelli|  of the  |Observatoire_de_la_Côte_dAzur|Côte_Dazur_Observatory|  in  |Nice|Nice|  suggested that the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn  created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits, and in some scenarios caused them to switch places, which would have doubled Neptunes distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt as Neptune moved outwards could explain the  |Late_Heavy_Bombardment|Late_Heavy_Bombardment|  600  million years after the Solar Systems formation and the origin of Jupiters  |Trojan_asteroids|Trojan_Asteroid| .    An outward migration of Neptune could also explain the current occupancy of some of its resonances within the Kuiper belt.     While Saturns mid-sized moons Dione and Tethys are not close to an exact resonance now, they may have been in a 2:3 resonance early in the Solar Systems history. This would have led to orbital eccentricity and  |tidal_heating|Tidal_Heating|  that may have warmed Tethys interior enough to form a subsurface ocean. Subsequent freezing of the ocean after the moons escaped from the resonance may have generated the extensional stresses that created the enormous  |graben|Graben|  system of  |Ithaca_Chasma|Ithaca_Chasma|  on Tethys.        The satellite system of Uranus is notably different from those of Jupiter and Saturn in that it lacks precise resonances among the larger moons, while the majority of the larger moons of Jupiter and of Saturn are in mean-motion resonances. In all three satellite systems, moons were likely captured into mean-motion resonances in the past as their orbits shifted due to  |tidal_dissipation|Tidal_Acceleration|  . In the Uranian system, however, due to the planets lesser degree of  |oblate|Oblate_Spheroid| ness, and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier. Lower oblateness of the primary alters its gravitational field in such a way that different possible resonances are spaced more closely together. A larger relative satellite size increases the strength of their interactions. Both factors lead to more chaotic orbital behavior at or near mean-motion resonances. Escape from a resonance may be associated with capture into a secondary resonance, and/or tidal evolution-driven increases in  |orbital_eccentricity|Orbital_Eccentricity|  or  |inclination|Inclination| .     Mean-motion resonances that probably once existed in the Uranus System include Ariel-Miranda, Umbriel-Miranda, Umbriel-Ariel, and Titania-Ariel.       Evidence for such past resonances includes the relatively high eccentricities of the orbits of Uranus inner satellites, and the anomalously high orbital inclination of Miranda. High past orbital eccentricities associated with the Umbriel-Miranda and Titania-Ariel resonances may have led to tidal heating of the interiors of Miranda and Ariel,    respectively. Miranda probably escaped from its resonance with Umbriel via a secondary resonance, and the mechanism of this escape is believed to explain why its orbital inclination is more than 10 times those of the other  |regular|Regular_Moon|  Uranian moons .           Similar to the case of Miranda, the present inclinations of Jupiters moonlets Amalthea and  |Thebe|Thebe|  are thought to be indications of past passage through the 3:1 and 4:2 resonances with Io, respectively.      Neptunes regular moons Proteus and Larissa are thought to have passed through a 1:2 resonance a few hundred million years ago; the moons have drifted away from each other since then because Proteus is outside a  |synchronous_orbit|Synchronous_Orbit|  and Larissa is within one. Passage through the resonance is thought to have excited both moons eccentricities to a degree that has not since been entirely damped out.     In the case of  |Plutos|Pluto|  satellites, it has been proposed that the present near resonances are relics of a previous precise resonance that was disrupted by tidal damping of the eccentricity of Charons orbit . The near resonances may be maintained by a 15% local fluctuation in the Pluto-Charon gravitational field. Thus, these near resonances may not be coincidental.     The smaller inner moon of the  |dwarf_planet|Dwarf_Planet| |Haumea|Haumea| ,  |Namaka|Namaka| , is one tenth the mass of the larger outer moon,  |Hiiaka|HiʻIaka| . Namaka revolves around Haumea in 18 days in an eccentric,  |non-Keplerian|Osculating_Orbit|  orbit, and as of 2008 is inclined 13° from Hiiaka. Over the timescale of the system, it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. It appears that it has been disturbed by resonances with the more massive Hiiaka, due to converging orbits as it moved outward from Haumea because of tidal dissipation. The moons may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times. They probably passed through the 3:1 resonance relatively recently, and currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance. Namakas orbit is strongly  |perturbed|Perturbation|.
