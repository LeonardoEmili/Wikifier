         In  |physics|Physics| , redshift is a phenomenon where  |electromagnetic_radiation|Electromagnetic_Radiation|   from an object undergoes an increase in  |wavelength|Wavelength| . Whether or not the radiation is visible, redshift means an increase in wavelength, equivalent to a decrease in wave  |frequency|Frequency|  and  |photon_energy|Photon_Energy| , in accordance with, respectively, the wave and  |quantum|Lightquantum_Theory|  theories of light.     Neither the emitted nor perceived light is necessarily red; instead, the term refers to the human perception of longer wavelengths as  |red|Red| , which is at the section of the  |visible_spectrum|Visible_Spectrum|  with the longest wavelengths. Examples of redshifting are a  |gamma_ray|Gamma_Ray|  perceived as an  |X_ray|X_Ray| , or initially visible light perceived as  |radio_waves|Radio_Wave| . The opposite of a redshift is a  |blueshift|Blueshift| , where wavelengths shorten and energy increases. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.     There are three main causes of redshifts in astronomy and cosmology:     Objects move apart in space. This is an example of the  |Doppler_effect|Doppler_Effect| .    |Space_itself_expanding|Expansion_Of_The_Universe| , causing objects to become separated without changing their positions in space. This is known as  |cosmological|Cosmological|  redshift. All sufficiently distant light sources  show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth, known as  |Hubbles_law|Hubbles_Law| .    |Gravitational_redshift|Gravitational_Redshift|  is a  |relativistic|General_Relativity|  effect observed due to strong  |gravitational_fields|Gravitational_Field| , which distort  |spacetime|Spacetime|  and exert a force on light and other particles.     Knowledge of redshifts and blueshifts has been used to develop several terrestrial technologies such as  |Doppler_radar|Doppler_Radar|  and  |radar_guns|Radar_Gun| . See Feynman, Leighton and Sands or any introductory undergraduate  |physics_textbooks|Physics_Further_Reading| . See Taylor for a relativistic discussion. Redshifts are also seen in the  |spectroscopic|Astronomical_Spectroscopy|  observations of  |astronomical|Astronomical|  objects. See Binney and Merrifeld , Carroll and Ostlie , Kutner for applications in astronomy. Its value is represented by the letter z.     A  |special_relativistic|Special_Relativity| |_redshift_formula|Redshift_Formulae|   can be used to calculate the redshift of a nearby object when  |spacetime|Spacetime|  is  |flat|Minkowski_Space| . However, in many contexts, such as  |black_holes|Black_Hole|  and  |Big_Bang|Big_Bang|  cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using  |general_relativity|General_Relativity| . See Misner, Thorne and Wheeler and Weinberg or any of the  |physical_cosmology_textbooks|Physical_Cosmologytextbooks|  Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of  |frame_transformation_laws|Frame_Of_Reference| . There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including  |scattering|Scattering|  and  |optical_effects|Physical_Optics| ; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such .            The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of  |wave|Wave|  mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the  |Doppler_effect|Doppler_Effect| . The effect is named after  |Christian_Doppler|Christian_Doppler| , who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842.    The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for  |sound_waves|Sound_Wave|  by the  |Dutch|Netherlands|  scientist  |Christophorus_Buys_Ballot|C_H_D_Buys_Ballot|  in 1845.    Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all  |waves|Wave| , and in particular suggested that the varying  |colors|Color|  of  |stars|Star|  could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth.    Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a stars  |temperature|Color_Temperature| , not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.     The first Doppler redshift was described by French physicist  |Hippolyte_Fizeau|Hippolyte_Fizeau|  in 1848, who pointed to the shift in  |spectral_lines|Spectral_Line|  seen in stars as being due to the Doppler effect. The effect is sometimes called the Doppler–Fizeau effect . In 1868, British astronomer  |William_Huggins|William_Huggins|  was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by this method.    In 1871, optical redshift was confirmed when the phenomenon was observed in  |Fraunhofer_lines|Fraunhofer_Lines|  using solar rotation, about 0.1 Å in the red.      In 1887, Vogel and Scheiner discovered the annual Doppler effect, the yearly change in the Doppler shift of stars located near the ecliptic due to the orbital velocity of the Earth.  In 1901,  |Aristarkh_Belopolsky|Aristarkh_Belopolsky|  verified optical redshift in the laboratory using a system of rotating mirrors.        The earliest occurrence of the term red-shift in print appears to be by American astronomer  |Walter_S_Adams|Walter_S_Adams|  in 1908, in which he mentions Two methods of investigating that nature of the nebular red-shift .    Reprinted in  The word does not appear unhyphenated until about 1934 by  |Willem_de_Sitter|Willem_De_Sitter| , perhaps indicating that up to that point its German equivalent, Rotverschiebung, was more commonly used.        Beginning with observations in 1912,  |Vesto_Slipher|Vesto_Slipher|  discovered that most  |spiral_galaxies|Spiral_Galaxy| , then mostly thought to be  |spiral_nebulae|Spiral_Galaxyspiral_Nebula| , had considerable redshifts. Slipher first reports on his measurement in the inaugural volume of the  Lowell Observatory Bulletin.    Three years later, he wrote a review in the journal  Popular Astronomy .    In it he states that the early discovery that the great Andromeda spiral had the quite exceptional velocity of –300 km showed the means then available, capable of investigating not only the spectra of the spirals but their velocities as well.    Slipher reported the velocities for 15 spiral nebulae spread across the entire  |celestial_sphere|Celestial_Sphere| , all but three having observable positive velocities. Subsequently,  |Edwin_Hubble|Edwin_Hubble|  discovered an approximate relationship between the redshifts of such nebulae and the  |distances|Distance|  to them with the formulation of his eponymous  |Hubbles_law|Hubbles_Law| .    These observations corroborated  |Alexander_Friedmanns|Alexander_Friedmann|  1922 work, in which he derived the  |Friedmann–Lemaître_equations|Friedmann_Equations| .
