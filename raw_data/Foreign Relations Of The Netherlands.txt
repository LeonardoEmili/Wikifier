     The foreign policy of the Netherlands is based on four basic commitments: to the  |Atlantic_cooperation|Atlanticism| , to  |European_integration|European_Integration| , to  |international_development|International_Development|  and to  |international_law|International_Law| . While historically the  |Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands|Kingdom_Of_The_Netherlands|  was a neutral state, since 1945 it has become a member of  |NATO|Nato| , the United Nations, the European Union and many other international organisations. The Dutch economy is very open and relies on international trade. During and after the 17th century—its  |Golden_Age|Dutch_Golden_Age| --the Dutch built up a commercial and colonial empire. It was a leading shipping and naval power and was often at war with England, its main rival. Its main colonial holding was Indonesia, which fought for and achieved independence after 1945. The historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the Netherlands. Foreign trade policy is handled by the European Union. The Dutch have been active in international peacekeeping roles.             In the  |Dutch_Golden_Age|Dutch_Golden_Age| , which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the  |sciences|List_Of_People_From_The_Dutch_Golden_Agescience| . A rich worldwide  |Dutch_empire|Dutch_Empire|  developed and the  |Dutch_East_India_Company|Dutch_East_India_Company|  became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.     During the 18th century the power and wealth of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful  |British|Anglo-Dutch_Wars|  and  |French|Franco-Dutch_War|  neighbors weakened it. Britain seized the North American colony of  |New_Amsterdam|New_Amsterdam| , turning it into New York. There was growing unrest and  |conflict|Second_Stadtholderless_Periodcrisis_And_The_Orangist_Revolution_Of_1747|  between the  |Orangists|Orangism|  and the  |Patriots|Patriottentijd| . The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French  |Batavian_Republic|Batavian_Republic|  was established in 1795–1806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the  |Kingdom_of_Holland|Kingdom_Of_Holland|  , and later simply a French imperial province.     In 1815–1940 it was neutral and played a minor role in world diplomacy, apart from a failed effort to control Belgium  |before_giving_up_in_1839.|Belgian_Revolution|  A. Vandenbosch, Dutch Foreign Policy since 1815 . It was invaded and cruelly treated by Germany in 1940–45, with starvation and killing the Jews the main Nazi policies.          The Dutch Government conducted a review of foreign policy main themes, organization, and funding in 1995. The document The Foreign Policy of the Netherlands: A Review outlined the new direction of Dutch foreign policy. The Netherlands prioritizes enhancing European integration, maintaining relations with neighboring states, ensuring European security and stability , and participating in conflict management and peacekeeping missions. The foreign policy review also resulted in the reorganization of the  |Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs|Ministry_Of_Foreign_Affairs| . Through the creation of regional departments, the Ministry coordinates tasks previously divided among the international cooperation, foreign affairs, and economic affairs sections.          Dutch security policy is based primarily on membership in NATO, which the Netherlands co-founded in 1949. Because of Dutch participation in NATO  |nuclear_weapons|Netherlands_And_Weapons_Of_Mass_Destruction|  are stationed in the Netherlands, see  |Volkel_Air_Base|Volkel_Air_Basepossible_Nuclear_Weapons| .     The Dutch also pursue defense cooperation within Europe, both multilaterally – in the context of the  |Western_European_Union|Western_European_Union|  and the  |European_Security_and_Defence_Policy|European_Security_And_Defence_Policy|  of the EU – and bilaterally, as in the German-Netherlands Corps. In recent years, the Dutch have become significant contributors to UN peacekeeping efforts around the world as well as to the Stabililzation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina  in Bosnia.       The Dutch have been strong advocates of European integration, and most aspects of their foreign, economic, and trade policies are coordinated through the  |European_Union|European_Union|  . The Dutch postwar customs union with  |Belgium|Belgium|  and  |Luxembourg|Luxembourg|   paved the way for the formation of the European Community , of which the Netherlands was a founding member. Likewise, the Benelux abolition of internal border controls was a model for the wider  |Schengen_Accord|Schengen_Treaty| , which today has 29 European signatories pledged to common visa policies and free movement of people across common borders.     The Dutch stood at the cradle of the 1992  |Maastricht_Treaty|Maastricht_Treaty|  and have been the architects of the  |Treaty_of_Amsterdam|Treaty_Of_Amsterdam|  concluded in 1998. The Dutch have thus played an important role in European political and monetary integration; indeed, until the year 2003, Dutchman  |Wim_Duisenberg|Wim_Duisenberg|  headed the European Central Bank. In addition, Dutch financial minister Gerrit Zalm was the main critic of the violation of the  |Stability_and_Growth_Pact|Stability_And_Growth_Pact|  by France and Germany in 2004 and 2005.            The Netherlands is among the worlds leading aid donors, giving almost $8  billion, about 0.8% of its gross national income in official development assistance . It is one of five countries worldwide that meets the longstanding UN ODA target of 0.7% ODA/GNI. The country consistently contributes large amounts of aid through multilateral channels, especially the  |United_Nations_Development_Programme|United_Nations_Development_Programme| , the international financial institutions, and EU programs. A large portion of Dutch aid funds also are channeled through private organizations that have almost total autonomy in choice of projects.     The Netherlands is a member of the  |European_Bank_for_Reconstruction_and_Development|European_Bank_For_Reconstruction_And_Development| , which recently initiated economic reforms in central Europe. The Dutch strongly support the  |Middle_East_peace_process|Projects_Working_For_Peace_Among_Israelis_And_Arabs|  and in 1998 earmarked $29  million in contributions to international donor-coordinated activities for the occupied territories and also for projects in which they worked directly with  |Palestinian|Palestinian_People|  authorities. These projects included improving environmental conditions and support for multilateral programs in cooperation with local non-governmental organizations. In 1998, the Dutch provided significant amounts of aid to the former Yugoslavia and Africa. The Dutch consistently provide significant amounts of  |humanitarian_relief_aid|Humanitarian_Aid|  to the victims of the worst natural disasters, such as the  |Hurricane_Mitch|Hurricane_Mitch|  in  |Central_America|Central_America|  in 1998,  |2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami|2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake_And_Tsunami|  in  |South|South_Asia|  and  |Southeast_Asia|Southeast_Asia| , the  |Hurricane_Katrina|Hurricane_Katrina|  in the  |United_States|United_States|  in 2005,  |2010_Haiti_earthquake|2010_Haiti_Earthquake| , and more recent catastrophes in  |Pakistan|Pakistan|  and  |Burma|Burma|  including the  |Typhoon_Haiyan|Typhoon_Haiyan|  in the  |Philippines|Philippines|  in 2013, and  |2015_Nepal_earthquake|April_2015_Nepal_Earthquake| .       Developing countries aspiring to purchase foreign goods and services to invest in, inter alia, port facilities, roads, public transport, health care, or drinking water facilities may be eligible for a special Dutch grant facility. The grant facility, known as ORET serves to award grants to governments of developing countries for making payments to foreign suppliers. , via Google Docs. Retrieved 2011-10-23.

The Netherlands is one of the founding members of what today is the  |European_Union|European_Union| . It was one of the first countries to start European integration, through the  |Benelux|Benelux|  in 1944 and the  |European_Coal_and_Steel_Community|European_Coal_And_Steel_Community|  in 1952. Being a small country with a history of neutrality it was the host country for the important  |Maastricht_Treaty|Maastricht_Treaty|  and  |Amsterdam_Treaty|Amsterdam_Treaty|  and is the seat of the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice| .          The country is one of the major producers of illicit  |amphetamines|Amfetamine|  and other synthetic drugs. It also functions as an important gateway for  |cocaine|Cocaine| , heroin, and  |hashish|Hashish|  entering Europe. A large portion of the worlds  |XTC|Ecstasy|  consumption is supplied by illegal  |laboratories|Laboratory|  from the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| .

From June 26 until December 22, 2006, two children, Ammar and Sara , lived in the Dutch  |embassy|Diplomatic_Mission|  in  |Damascus|Damascus|  because of a  |child_custody|Child_Custody|  dispute between the Dutch mother, supported by Dutch law and the  |Hague_Convention_on_the_Civil_Aspects_of_International_Child_Abduction|Hague_Convention_On_The_Civil_Aspects_Of_International_Child_Abduction| , and the Syrian father, supported by Syrian law . The children had been living in Syria since 2004, after an alleged  |international_child_abduction|Child_Abductioninternational_Child_Abduction|  by the father from the Netherlands to Syria, during a  |family_contact|Contact|  in which he supposedly would visit Paris with them. The children fled to the embassy because they would like to live with their mother in the Netherlands.  |Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs|Minister_Of_Foreign_Affairs| |Ben_Bot|Ben_Bot|  travelled to Damascus, negotiated and on December 22 the children finally could return to the Netherlands.     The father claims that the Dutch government has promised not to prosecute him for the abduction. However, a Dutch prosecutor claims that he is free to prosecute the father and may well do that, and that the Dutch have only retracted the international request to arrest him outside the Netherlands.
