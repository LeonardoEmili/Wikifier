The dative case  is a  |grammatical_case|Grammatical_Case|  used in some languages to indicate the recipient or beneficiary of an action, as in Maria Jacobo potum dedit , Latin for Maria gave Jacob a drink . In this example, the dative marks what would be considered the  |indirect_object|Indirect_Object|  of a  |verb|Verb|  in English.     Sometimes the dative has functions unrelated to giving. In  |Scottish_Gaelic|Scottish_Gaelic_Language|  and  |Irish|Irish_Language| , the term dative case is used in traditional grammars to refer to the  |prepositional_case|Prepositional_Case| -marking of nouns following simple  |prepositions|Preposition|  and the definite article. In  |Georgian|Georgian_Language| , the dative case also marks the subject of the sentence with some verbs and some tenses. This is called the  |dative_construction|Dative_Construction| .     The dative was common among early  |Indo_European_languages|Indo_European_Languages|  and has survived to the present in the  |Balto_Slavic|Balto_Slavic_Languages|  branch and the  |Germanic|Germanic_Languages|  branch, among others. It also exists in similar forms in several non-Indo-European languages, such as the  |Uralic|Uralic_Languages|  family of languages. In some languages, the dative case has assimilated the functions of other, now extinct cases. In  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek| , the dative has the functions of the  |Proto_Indo_European|Proto_Indo_European_Language| |_locative|Locative_Case|  and  |instrumental|Instrumental_Case|  as well as those of the original dative.     Under the influence of English, which uses the preposition to for both indirect objects  and directions of movement , the term dative has sometimes been used to describe cases that in other languages would more appropriately be called  |lative|Lative_Case| .       Dative comes from  |Latin|Latin|  cāsus datīvus , a translation of Greek δοτικὴ πτῶσις, dotikē ptôsis ,  from its use with the verb didónai to give .   |Dionysius_Thrax|Dionysius_Thrax|  in his  |Art_of_Grammar|Art_Of_Grammar|  also refers to it as epistaltikē & 769; for sending , Dionysius Thrax.  , section ιβ´ : περὶ ὀνόματος . Bibliotheca Augustana. from the verb epistéllō send to , a word from the same root as  |epistle|Epistle| .       The  |Old_English_language|Old_English_Language| , which continued in use until after the  |Norman_Conquest|Norman_Conquest|  of 1066, had a dative case; however, the English case system gradually fell into disuse during the  |Middle_English|Middle_English|  period, when the accusative and dative of pronouns merged into a single  |oblique_case|Oblique_Case|  that was also used with all prepositions. This conflation of case in Middle and Modern English has led most modern grammarians to discard the accusative and dative labels as obsolete in reference to English, often using the term objective for oblique.         The dative case is rare in modern English usage, but it can be argued that it survives in a few set expressions. One example is the word methinks , with the meaning it seems to me . It survives in this fixed form from Old English , in which it was constructed as + me + thinks  sg. vaikui, pl. vaikams; ranka -  .
