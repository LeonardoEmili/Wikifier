The John von Neumann Theory Prize of the  |Institute_for_Operations_Research_and_the_Management_Sciences|Institute_For_Operations_Research_And_The_Management_Sciences|    is awarded annually to an individual who has made fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in  |operations_research|Operations_Research|  and the management sciences.     The Prize named after mathematician  |John_von_Neumann|John_Von_Neumann|  is awarded for a body of work, rather than a single piece. The Prize was intended to reflect contributions that have stood the test of time. The criteria include significance, innovation, depth, and scientific excellence.     The award is $5,000, a medallion and a citation.     The Prize has been awarded since 1975. The first recipient was  |George_B._Dantzig|George_Dantzig|  for his work on  |linear_programming|Linear_Programming| .       2019  |Dimitris_Bertsimas|Dimitris_Bertsimas|  and  |Jong-Shi_Pang|Jong-Shi_Pang| |Dimitri_Bertsekas|Dimitri_Bertsekas|  and  |John_Tsitsiklis|John_Tsitsiklis|  for contributions to Parallel and Distributed Computation as well as Neurodynamic Programming.  |Donald_Goldfarb|Donald_Goldfarb|  and  |Jorge_Nocedal|Jorge_Nocedal|  for seminal contributions to the theory and applications of nonlinear optimization over the past several decades.  |Martin_I._Reiman|Martin_I._Reiman|  and  |Ruth_J._Williams|Ruth_J._Williams|  for seminal research contributions over the past several decades, to the theory and applications of “stochastic networks/systems” and their “heavy traffic approximations.”  |Vašek_Chvátal|Vašek_Chvátal|  and  |Jean_Bernard_Lasserre|Jean_Bernard_Lasserre|  for seminal and profound contributions to the theoretical foundations of optimization.  |Nimrod_Megiddo|Nimrod_Megiddo|  for fundamental contributions across a broad range of areas of operations research and management science, most notably in linear programming, combinatorial optimization, and algorithmic game theory.  |Michel_Balinski|Michel_Balinski| .   2012  |George_Nemhauser|George_Nemhauser|  and  |Laurence_Wolsey|Laurence_Wolsey| . , INFORMS announcement   2011  |Gérard_Cornuéjols|Gérard_Cornuéjols| , IBM University Professor of Operations Research at Carnegie Mellon Universitys  |Tepper_School_of_Business|Tepper_School_Of_Business|  for his fundamental and broad contributions to discrete optimization including his deep research on balanced and ideal matrices, perfect graphs and cutting planes for mixed-integer optimization.   2010 Søren Asmussen and Peter W.
