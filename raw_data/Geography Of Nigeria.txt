      Nigeria is a country in  |West_Africa|West_Africa| .  |Nigeria|Nigeria|  shares land  |borders|Border|  with the Republic of  |Benin|Benin|  in the west,  |Chad|Chad|  and  |Cameroon|Cameroon|  in the east, and  |Niger|Niger|  in the north. Its coast lies on the  |Gulf_of_Guinea|Gulf_Of_Guinea|  in the south and it borders  |Lake_Chad|Lake_Chad|  to the northeast. Noted geographical features in Nigeria include the  |Adamawa_highlands|Adamawa_Highlands| ,  |Mambilla_Plateau|Mambilla_Plateau| ,  |Jos_Plateau|Jos_Plateau| ,  |Obudu_Plateau|Obudu_Plateau| , the  |Niger_River|Niger_River| ,  |River_Benue|River_Benue|  and  |Niger_Delta|Niger_Delta| .     Nigeria is found in the  |Tropics|Tropics| , where the climate is seasonally damp and very humid.   Nigeria is affected by four  |climate_types|Köppen_Climate_Classification| ; these climate types are distinguishable, as one moves from the  |southern_part_of_Nigeria|Southern_Nigeria_Protectorate|  to the  |northern_part_of_Nigeria|Northern_Nigeria|  through Nigerias  |middle_belt|Middle_Belt| .        The  |tropical_monsoon_climate|Tropical_Monsoon_Climate| , designated by the  |Köppen_climate_classification|Köppen_Climate_Classification|  as Am , is found in the southern part of the country. This climate is influenced by the  |monsoons|Monsoon|  originating from the South  |Atlantic_ocean|Atlantic_Ocean| , which is brought into the country by the MT  |airmass|Airmass| , a warm moist sea to land seasonal wind. Its warmth and high humidity gives it a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious rainfall, which is a result of the condensation of water vapour in the rapidly rising air.      The Tropical monsoon climate has a very small temperature range. Then temperature ranges are almost constant throughout the year, for example,  |Warri_town|Warri|  in the southern part of Nigeria, records a maximum of  for its hottest month while its lowest temperature is  in its coldest month. The temperature difference of Warri town is not more than 2  °C .     The southern part of Nigeria experiences heavy and abundant rainfall. These storms are usually  |convectional|Precipitation|  in nature due to the regions proximity, to the  |equatorial_belt|Equator| . The annual rainfall received in this region is very high, usually above the  rainfall totals giving for tropical rainforest climates worldwide. Over  of rainfall is received in the coastal region of Nigeria around the  |Niger_delta|Niger_Delta|  area. Bonny town found in the coastal region of the Niger delta area in southern Nigeria receives well over  of rainfall annually. The rest of the southeast receives between 2,000 and  of rain per year.     The southern region of Nigeria experiences a double rainfall maxima characterised by two high rainfall peaks, with a short dry season and a longer dry season falling between and after each peaks. The first rainy season begins around March and last to the end of July with a peak in June, this rainy season is followed by a short dry break in August known as the August break which is a short dry season lasting for two to three weeks in August. This break is broken by the short rainy season starting around early September and lasting to mid October with a peak period at the end of September. The ending of the short rainy season in October is followed by long dry season. This period starts from late October and lasts until early March with peak dry conditions between early December and late February.      The  |tropical_savanna_climate_or_tropical_wet_and_dry_climate|Tropical_Savanna_Climate| , is extensive in area and covers most of western Nigeria to central Nigeria beginning from the tropical rainforest climate boundary in southern Nigeria to the  |central|Middle_Belt|  part of Nigeria, where it exerts enormous influence on the region.     This climate, the tropical savanna climate exhibits a well marked rainy season and a dry season with a single peak known as the summer maximum due to its distance from the equator. Temperatures are above  throughout the year.  |Abuja|Abuja| , Nigerias capital city found in central Nigeria, has a temperature range of  to , and an annual rainfall of about  with a single rainfall maxima in September.      The single dry season experienced in this climate, the tropical savanna climate in central Nigeria beginning from December to March, is hot and dry with the  |Harmattan|Harmattan|  wind, a continental tropical airmass laden with dust from the  |Sahara|Sahara|  Desert prevailing throughout this period.     With the  |Intertropical_Convergence_Zone_|Intertropical_Convergence_Zone|  swinging northward over West Africa from the  |Southern_Hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere|  in April, heavy showers coming from pre-monsoonal convective clouds mainly in the form of  |squall_lines|Squall_Line|  also known as the north easterlies formed mainly as a result of the interactions of the two dominant airmasses in Nigeria known as the Maritime tropical and the Continental tropical,  begins in central Nigeria while the Monsoons from the south atlantic ocean arrives in central Nigeria in July bringing with it high humidity, heavy cloud cover and heavy rainfall which can be daily occurrence lasting till September when the monsoons gradually begin retreating southward to the southern part of Nigeria. Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from  in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over  along the south western escarpment of the  |Jos_Plateau|Jos_Plateau| .      The  |Sahel_climate_or_tropical_dry_climate|Sahel| , is the predominant climate type in the northern part of Nigeria. Annual rainfall totals are lower compared to the southern and central part of Nigeria. The rainy season in the northern part of Nigeria last for only three to four months . The rest of the year is hot and dry with temperatures climbing as high as  .      |Alpine_climate_or_highland_climate_or_mountain_climate|Alpine_Climate|  are found on highlands regions in Nigeria. Highlands with the alpine climate in Nigeria, are well over  above sea level. Due to their location in the tropics, this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands, mountains and the  |plateau_regions|Plateau|  standing above this height, a cool mountain climate.       Nigeria, like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands, has only two  |seasons|Seasons| . These are the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert, locally known as  |Harmattan|Harmattan| , or by its main name, The Tropical Continental airmass, while the rainy season is heavily influenced by an airmass originating from the south Atlantic ocean, locally known as the south western wind, or by its main name, The Tropical Maritime airmass. These two major wind systems in Nigeria are known as the  |trade_winds|Trade_Winds| .             The tropical maritime airmass is responsible for Nigerias rainy season. This wind invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country, reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June. Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat, of the tropical continental airmass known as the harmattan. The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass , is caused by the suns northward shift from the  |tropic_of_capricorn|Tropic_Of_Capricorn|  in the  |southern_hemisphere|Southern_Hemisphere|  to the  |tropic_of_cancer|Tropic_Of_Cancer|  in the  |northern_hemisphere|Northern_Hemisphere| . This shift begins from February and ends in June, when the sun is fully overhead, at the  |tropic_of_cancer|Tropic_Of_Cancer|  in the northern hemisphere.     During this northward migration of the sun as a result of the earth tilting along its axis, the sun crosses the equator , moving over west Africa at this time on its journey to the northern hemisphere. West Africa comes directly under the sun at this time. The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the suns northward migration to the  |tropic_of_cancer|Tropic_Of_Cancer|  in the northern hemisphere.     The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased  |insolation|Insolation|  received from the sun being overhead over west Africa. Temperatures can climb as high as  over west Africa during this time. Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as  in cities like Maiduguri.  & viewarticle & id3565:maiduguri-residents-how-we-cope-under-harsh-48-degree-celsius & catid41:latest-news & Itemid26      The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria . The Tropical continental airmass from the Sahara Desert in the northern part of west Africa, is weakened due to the overheating of the land surface in west Africa and Nigeria at this time. The Tropical continental airmass begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass which constitutes the main layer of air above the land. This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass in turn, causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds.   The Tropical continental airmass loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass , further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria.   The Tropical continental airmass finally retreats from most part of Nigeria, and the West African  |atmosphere|Atmosphere|  around April to May, leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria. The suns rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass, which contained dust that reduced the intensity of the sun.  The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria. This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure.     The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm  |humid|Humid|  and unstable trade wind due to its warmth. Convectional currents are easily set up within the airmass whenever there is little instability in the airmass as a result of a slight to a very high orographic uplift in mountainous regions like the  |obudu_plateau|Obudu_Plateau|  or the heating of the land which can trigger the formation of  |cumulonimbus_cloud|Cumulonimbus_Clouds|  leading to  |thunderstorms|Thunderstorms|  within the airmass.     During the dominance of the Tropical Maritime Airmass in the rainy season of Nigeria, mornings are bright and sunny, the suns heating of the land in the mornings and afternoons sets up convectional currents, these currents rise vertically and  |cumulonimbus|Cumulonimbus|  clouds are formed, by afternoons to evenings, torrential downpour follows.     The Easterly wave or the African easterly waves is another major contributor of rainfall during the summer monsoons months of May to September in Nigeria.     The nature of this waves changes at about the  |15_degrees_line|Latitude| . The waves that pass south of this line carry moisture and create convection that leads to rain clouds.  Nigerias northern end is south of the 15 degrees line at about 14 degrees.  Nigerias location in the wetter part of the easterly waves south of the 15 degree line creates wetter climatic conditions for Nigeria especially during the monsoons.       The Tropical Continental Airmass locally known as the  |Harmattan|Harmattan| , is a wind originating from  |North_Africa|North_Africa|  which crosses the Sahara Desert into west Africa to Nigeria. This airmass dominates Nigerias climate during the dry season from December to March. The Tropical continental airmass is dusty and creates a haze within the atmosphere of west Africa and Nigeria when it predominates. The haze is as a result of the dust within the airmass limiting visibility and blocking much of the suns rays from reaching the earth. It is also a dry air mass formed over land in a area close to the equator. An example of Tropical Continental is a warm air mass that forms over northern Mexico.       The mass has no ability of forming rain due to low humidity within the airmass, since it crosses the Sahara Desert, it picks up dust instead of water thereby creating little chances for rainfall.     The airmass makes life difficult as a result of low visibility which hampers transportation.   The dust haze creates an almost desert conditions in the country during the dominance of the Tropical continental airmass . But its coming brings some relief to farmers since the low humidity present in the air quickens the drying of their  |crops|Crops| .         Nigerias location in the tropics has given her a tropical hot climate. Temperatures in Nigeria vary according to the  |seasons|Seasons|  of the year as with other lands found in the tropics. Nigerias seasons are determined by rainfall with rainy season and dry season being the major seasons in Nigeria.     The rainy season of Nigeria brings in cooler weather to the country as a result of an increased cloud cover that acts as a blockage of the intense sunshine of the tropics by blocking much of the suns rays in the rainy season; this in turn cools the land, and the winds above the ground remains cool thereby making for cooler temperatures during the rainy season. But afternoons in the rainy season can be hot and humid, a feature of tropical climates. In the rainy season it is damp, and the rainfalls are usually abundant.     The dry season of Nigeria is a period of little cloud cover in the southern part of Nigeria to virtually no cloud cover in the northern part of Nigeria. The sun shines through the atmosphere with little obstructions from the clear skies making the dry season in Nigeria a period of warm weather conditions. In the middle of the dry season around December, a dusty wind from the Sahara Desert called the Harmattan enters Nigeria from the northeastern part of the country blocking sun rays partially from shining and also creating haze in the atmosphere, this activities of the wind lowers temperatures considerably saving inhabitants for sometime, from the scorching heat that would have occurred as a result of clearer skies during the dry season. But with the withdrawal of this wind around March to April following the onset of the rainy season, temperatures can go as high as  in some parts of Nigeria.      Semi temperate weather conditions prevail on the highlands in  |central_Nigeria|Middle_Belt|  above  above sea level, namely the  |Jos_Plateau|Jos_Plateau| . Temperatures on the Jos plateau ranges between 16  °C to 25  °C which are cool all year round.      |Temperate|Temperate|  weather conditions occur on the highlands along the Nigeria  |Cameroon|Cameroon|  border, in the eastern part of Nigeria. Highlands in these region attain an average height of more than  to some standing above  above sea level. The climate on these highlands is temperate all year round. The major highlands in this region are the  |Obudu_Plateau|Obudu_Plateau|  above ,  |Mambilla_Plateau|Mambilla_Plateau|  above  and  |Mt_Chappal_Waddi|Chappal_Waddi|  above .          Nigerias most expansive topographical region is that of the  |valleys|Valleys|  of the  |Niger|Niger_River|  and  |Benue_River|Benue_River|  valleys .  Plains rise to the north of the valleys. To the southwest of the Niger there is rugged  |highland|Highland| , and to the southeast of the Benue hills and mountains are found all the way to the border with  |Cameroon|Cameroon| .  |Coastal_plains|Coastal_Plain|  are found in both the southwest and the southeast.          The  |Niger_Delta|Niger_Delta|  is located in the southern part of Nigeria. It is one of the worlds largest  |arcuate|River_Delta|  fan-shaped  |river_deltas|River_Delta| .     The  |riverine|Riverine|  area of the Niger Delta is a coastal belt of swamps bordering the  |Atlantic_ocean|Atlantic_Ocean| . The  |swamps|Swamps|  are vegetated tidal flats formed by a reticulate pattern of interconnected meandering  |creeks|Stream|  and tributaries of the Niger River.       The  |vegetation|Vegetation|  of the  |Niger_Delta|Niger_Delta|  consist mainly of  |forest|Forest| |_swamps|Swamps| . The forest are of two types, nearest the  |sea|Sea|  is a belt of saline/brackish  |Mangrove|Mangrove|  swamp separated from the sea by sand beach  |ridges|Ridges|  within the mangrove swamp. Numerous sandy  |islands|Islands|  occur with fresh water vegetation.  |Fresh_water|Fresh_Water|  swamps gradually supersede the mangrove on the landward side. About 70% of Nigerias  |crude_oil|Crude_Oil|  and  |gas|Gas|  production is from the area.       Rainfall in the coastal belt of the Niger Delta is heavy due to the closeness of the Delta region to the equator. Annual rainfall totals vary from 2,400 to over 4,000 millimeters.     Niger Delta cities and their annually rainfall totals in millimeters:      |Warri|Warri|  — 2,730 mm    |Forcados|Forcados|  — 4,870 mm    |Port_Harcourt|Port_Harcourt|  — 2,400 mm    |Calabar|Calabar|  — 3,070 mm    |Bonny|Bonny_Nigeria|  — 4,200 mm          Nigeria is covered by three types of vegetation: forests , savannahs , and  |montane|Montane|  land. Both the forest zone and the savannah zone are divided into three parts.      Some of the forest zones most southerly portion, especially around the  |Niger_River|Niger_River|  and  |Cross_River|Cross_River|  deltas, is  |mangrove|Mangrove|  swamp . North of this is fresh water swamp, containing different vegetation from the salt water mangrove swamps, and north of that is rain forest.     The savannah zones three categories are divided into mm  |Guinean_forest_savanna_mosaic|Guinean_Forest_Savanna_Mosaic| , made up of plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees, the most common across the country; Sudan savannah, similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees; and  |Sahel|Sahel|  savannah patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast.                        The current population of Nigeria is 202,041,733 as of Monday, September 16, 2019, based on the latest United Nations estimates.   Nigeria population is equivalent to 2.61% of the total world population.   Nigeria ranks number 7 in the list of countries by population.   The population density in Nigeria is 221 per Km2 .   The total land area is 910,770 Km2   51.2 % of the population is urban   The median age in Nigeria is 17.9 years             |Nigeria|Nigeria| , the most populous  |African|Africa|  country , is nearly equally divided between  |Christianity|Christianity|  and  |Islam|Islam| , though the exact ratio is uncertain. The majority of Nigerian Muslims are  |Sunni|Sunni_Islam|  and are concentrated in the northern region of the country, while Christians dominate in the south. Most of Nigerias Christians are  |Protestant|Protestant|  though about a quarter are  |Catholic|Catholicism| .     Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa.  |Islam|Islam|  dominates the north and has a number of supporters in the southwestern,  |Yoruba|Yoruba_People|  part of the country. In terms of Nigerias major ethnic groups religious affiliations, the  |Hausa|Hausa_People|  ethnic group in the north is mostly Muslim, the  |Yoruba|Yoruba_People|  tribe in the west is divided among mainly Christianity, Islam and traditional religions, while the  |Igbos|Igbos|  of the east and the  |Ijaw|Ijaw_People|  in the south are predominantly Christians and some practitioners of traditional religions. The  |middle_belt|Middle_Belt|  of Nigeria contains the most of the minority ethnic groups in Nigeria and they are mostly Christians and members of traditional religions with few Muslim converts.     The vast majority of  |Muslims_in_Nigeria|Islam_In_Nigeria|  are  |Sunni|Sunni_Islam| , belonging to  |Maliki|Maliki|  school of  |jurisprudence|Jurisprudence| ; however, a sizeable minority also belongs to  |Shafi|Shafi| |_madhhab|Madhhab| . Many  |Sunni|Sunni| |_Muslims|Muslim|  are members of  |Sufi|Sufi|  brotherhoods. Most Sufis follow the  |Qadiriyya|Qadiriyya| ,  |Tijaniyyah|Tijaniyyah|  or  |Mouride|Mouride|  movement. A significant  |Shia|Shia|  minority exists . Some northern states have incorporated  |Sharia|Sharia|  law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy.  |Kano_State|Kano_State|  has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution. The majority of  |Quranists|Quranist|  follow the Kalo Kato or Quraniyyun movement. There are also  |Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya|  and Mahdiyya minorities.      |Read_more|Religion_In_Nigeria|        Nigerias natural resources include but are not limited to  |petroleum|Petroleum|  ,  |tin|Tin| ,  |columbite|Columbite| ,  |iron_ore|Iron_Ore| ,  |coal|Coal| ,  |limestone|Limestone| ,  |lead|Lead| ,  |zinc|Zinc| ,  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas| ,  |hydropower|Hydropower| , and  |arable_land|Arable_Land| .
