Foot also supported unilateral disarmament, after multilateral disarmament talks at  |Geneva|Geneva|  had broken down in 1933. Jones, p. 30.     Foot became a journalist, working briefly on the  New Statesman , before joining the left-wing weekly  Tribune  when it was set up in early 1937 to support the Unity Campaign, an attempt to secure an  |anti-fascist|Anti-Fascist| |United_Front|United_Front|  between Labour and other left-wing parties. The campaigns members were  |Stafford_Crippss|Stafford_Cripps| |Socialist_League|Socialist_League| , the  |Independent_Labour_Party|Independent_Labour_Party|  and the  |Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain|Communist_Party_Of_Great_Britain|  .

BBC TV.  Alison Cahn . Anne Tyerman . Michael Cockerell . Retrieved 5 December 2010.       On the recommendation of  |Aneurin_Bevan|Aneurin_Bevan| , Foot was soon hired by  |Lord_Beaverbrook|Max_Aitken,_1St_Baron_Beaverbrook|  to work as a writer on his  Evening Standard . At the outbreak of the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War| , Foot volunteered for military service, but was rejected because of his chronic  |asthma|Asthma| . It was suggested in 2011 that he became a member of the secret  |Auxiliary_Units|Auxiliary_Units| .      In 1940, under the pen-name Cato he and two other Beaverbrook journalists  published  Guilty Men , which attacked the  |appeasement|Appeasement|  policy of the  |Chamberlain|Neville_Chamberlain|  government; it became a runaway bestseller. Beaverbrook made Foot editor of the  Evening Standard  in 1942, when he was aged 28. During the war, Foot made a speech that was later featured in the documentary TV series  The World at War  broadcast in February 1974.  Foot was speaking in defence of the  Daily Mirror , which had criticised the conduct of the war by the  |Churchill|Winston_Churchill|  government. He mocked the notion that the Government would make  |no_more_territorial_demands|Appeasement|  of other newspapers if they allowed the Mirror to be censored.     Foot left the Standard in 1945 to join the  Daily Herald  as a columnist. The Daily Herald was jointly owned by the  |TUC|Trades_Union_Congress|  and  |Odhams_Press|Odhams_Press| , and was effectively an official Labour Party paper. He rejoined  Tribune  as editor from 1948 to 1952, and was again the papers editor from 1955 to 1960. Throughout his political career he railed against the increasing corporate domination of the press.          Foot fought the  |Plymouth_Devonport_constituency|Plymouth_Devonport|  in the  |1945_general_election|1945_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . His election agent was Labour activist and lifelong friend Ron Lemin. He won the seat for Labour for the first time, holding it until his surprise defeat by  |Dame_Joan_Vickers|Dame_Joan_Vickers|  at the  |1955_general_election|1955_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . Until 1957, he was the most prominent ally of  |Aneurin_Bevan|Aneurin_Bevan| , who had taken Crippss place as leader of the Labour left, though Foot and Bevan fell out after Bevan renounced  |unilateral_nuclear_disarmament|Unilateral_Nuclear_Disarmament|  at the 1957 Labour Party conference.     Before the Cold War began in the late 1940s, Foot favoured a third way foreign policy for Europe , but in the wake of the communist seizure of power in  |Hungary|Peoples_Republic_Of_Hungary|  and  |Czechoslovakia|History_Of_Czechoslovakia|  he and Tribune took a strongly anti-communist position, eventually embracing  |NATO|Nato| .     Foot was however a critic of the  |Wests|Western_Civilisation|  handling of the  |Korean_War|Korean_War| , an opponent of  |West_German_rearmament|Wiederbewaffnung|  in the early 1950s and a founder member of the  |Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament|Campaign_For_Nuclear_Disarmament| . Under his editorship, Tribune opposed both the British governments  |Suez|Suez_Crisis|  adventure and the Soviet crushing of the  |Hungarian_Revolution|Hungarian_Revolution_Of_1956|  in 1956. In this period he made regular television appearances on the current affairs programmes In The News and subsequently Free Speech . There was certainly nothing wrong with his television technique in those days , reflected  |Anthony_Howard|Anthony_Howard|  shortly after Foots death.      Foot returned to parliament at a  |by-election_in_Ebbw_Vale|1960_Ebbw_Vale_By-Election| ,  |Monmouthshire|Monmouthshire| , in 1960, the seat having been left vacant by Bevans death. He had the Labour whip withdrawn in March 1961 after rebelling against the Labour leadership over air force estimates. He only returned to the Parliamentary Labour Group in 1963, when Harold Wilson became Labour leader after the sudden death of  |Hugh_Gaitskell|Hugh_Gaitskell| .      |Harold_Wilson|Harold_Wilson|  — the subject of an enthusiastic campaign biography by Foot published by  |Robert_Maxwells|Robert_Maxwell|  Pergamon Press in 1964 — offered Foot a place in his first government, but Foot turned it down, instead becoming the leader of Labours left opposition from the back benches. He opposed the governments moves to restrict immigration, join the  |European_Communities|European_Communities|  and reform the trade unions, was against the  |Vietnam_War|Vietnam_War|  and  |Rhodesias|Rhodesia|  unilateral declaration of independence, and denounced the Soviet suppression of  |socialism_with_a_human_face|Prague_Spring|  in  |Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia|  in 1968. He also famously allied with the Tory right-winger  |Enoch_Powell|Enoch_Powell|  to scupper the governments plan to abolish the voting rights of hereditary peers and create a House of Lords comprising only life peers — a seraglio of eunuchs as Foot put it. , HC Deb 03 February 1969 vol 777 cc43-171     Foot challenged  |James_Callaghan|James_Callaghan|  for the post of  |Treasurer_of_the_Labour_Party|Treasurer_Of_The_Labour_Party|  in 1967, but failed.       After 1970, Labour moved to the left and Wilson came to an accommodation with Foot. Foot served in the  |Second_Shadow_Cabinet_of_Harold_Wilson|Second_Shadow_Cabinet_Of_Harold_Wilson|  in various roles between 1970 and 1974. In  |April_1972|1972_Labour_Party_Deputy_Leadership_Election| , he stood for the  |Deputy_Leadership|Deputy_Leader_Of_The_British_Labour_Party|  of the party, along with  |Edward_Short|Edward_Short,_Baron_Glenamara|  and  |Anthony_Crosland|Anthony_Crosland| . Short defeated Foot in the second ballot after Crosland had been eliminated in the first.     When, in 1974, Labour returned to office under Wilson, Foot became  |Secretary_of_State_for_Employment|Secretary_Of_State_For_Employment| . According to Ben Pimlott, his appointment was intended to please the left of the party and the Trade Unions. In this role, he played the major part in the governments efforts to maintain the trade unions support. He was also responsible for the  |Health_and_Safety_at_Work_Act|Health_And_Safety_At_Work_Act| . Foot was one of the mainstays of the no campaign in the  |1975_referendum|1975_United_Kingdom_European_Communities_Membership_Referendum|  on British membership of the European Communities. When Wilson retired in 1976, Foot  |contested_the_party_leadership|1976_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  and led in the first ballot, but was ultimately defeated by James Callaghan. Later that year Foot  |was_elected|1976_Labour_Party_Deputy_Leadership_Election|  Deputy Leader, and served as  |Leader_of_the_House_of_Commons|Leader_Of_The_House_Of_Commons| , which gave him the unenviable task of trying to maintain the survival of the Callaghan government as its majority evaporated.     In 1975, Foot, along with  |Jennie_Lee|Jennie_Lee,_Baroness_Lee_Of_Asheridge|  and others, courted controversy when they supported  |Indira_Gandhi|Indira_Gandhi| , the Prime Minister of India, after she prompted the declaration of  |a_state_of_emergency|The_Emergency| . In December 1975,  The Times  ran an editorial titled Is Mr Foot a Fascist? — their answer was that he was —  after  |Norman_Tebbit|Norman_Tebbit|  accused him of undiluted fascism when Foot said that the  |Ferrybridge_Six|Ferrybridge_Six|  deserved dismissal for defying a  |closed_shop|Closed_Shop| .      During the  |Callaghan_government|Labour_Government,_1974–1979|  Foot took a seat in  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  as  |Lord_President_of_the_Council|Lord_President_Of_The_Council|  and  |Leader_of_the_House_of_Commons|Leader_Of_The_House_Of_Commons| .          Following Labours  |1979_general_election_defeat|1979_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  by  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher| ,  |James_Callaghan|James_Callaghan|  remained as party leader for the next 18 months before he resigned. Foot was elected Labour leader on 10 November 1980, beating  |Denis_Healey|Denis_Healey|  in the second round of the  |leadership_election|1980_Labour_Party_Leadership_Election|  . Foot presented himself as a compromise candidate, capable — unlike Healey — of uniting the party,  which at the time was riven by the  |grassroots|Grassroots|  left-wing insurgency centred around  |Tony_Benn|Tony_Benn| .     The Bennites were demanding revenge for what they considered to be the betrayals of the  |Callaghan_government|Labour_Government,_1974–1979Callaghan_Ministry| . They called for MPs who had acquiesced in Callaghans policies to be replaced by left-wingers who would support unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Communities, and widespread  |nationalisation|Nationalisation| .
