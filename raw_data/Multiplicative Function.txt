Outside number theory, the term multiplicative function is usually used for completely multiplicative function s. This article discusses number theoretic multiplicative functions.     In  |number_theory|Number_Theory| , a multiplicative function is an  |arithmetic_function|Arithmetic_Function|  f of a positive  |integer|Integer|  n with the property that f 1 and whenever   a and b are  |coprime|Coprime| , then     : f ff.     An arithmetic function f is said to be  completely multiplicative   if f 1 and f ff holds for all positive integers a and b, even when they are not coprime.         Some multiplicative functions are defined to make formulas easier to write:     1 1   Id |identity_function|Identity_Function| , defined by Id n   Id k k  n k for any complex number k . As special cases we have   Id 0  1 and   Id 1  Id.   εε 1 if n 1 and 0 otherwise, sometimes called multiplication unit for Dirichlet convolution  or simply the  unit function  . Sometimes written as u, but not to be confused with μ .   1 C , the  |indicator_function|Indicator_Function|  of the set C ⊂ Z, for certain sets C. The indicator function 1 C  is multiplicative precisely when the set C has the following property for any coprime numbers a and bab is in C if and only if the numbers a and b are both themselves in C. This is the case if C is the set of squares, cubes, or k-th powers, or if C is the set of  |square-free|Square-Free|  numbers.     Other examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory, such as:     gcd |greatest_common_divisor|Greatest_Common_Divisor|  of n and k, as a function of n, where k is a fixed integer.      |Eulers_totient_function|Eulers_Totient_Function|    , counting the positive integers  |coprime|Coprime|  to n μ |Möbius_function|Möbius_Function| , the parity of the number of prime factors of  |square-free|Square-Free_Integer|  numbers; 0 if n is not square-free   σ k  |divisor_function|Divisor_Function| , which is the sum of the k-th powers of all the positive divisors of n . Special cases we have   σ 0  d the number of positive  |divisors|Divisor|  of n,   σ 1  σ, the sum of all the positive divisors of n.   an.   λ |Liouville_function|Liouville_Function| , λ & Omega; where & Omega; is the total number of primes dividing n. .   γ, defined by γ ω , where the  |additive_function|Additive_Function|  ω is the number of distinct primes dividing n.   τ |Ramanujan_tau_function|Ramanujan_Tau_Function| .   All  |Dirichlet_characters|Dirichlet_Character|  are completely multiplicative functions. For example   , the  |Legendre_symbol|Legendre_Symbol| , considered as a function of n where p is a fixed  |prime_number|Prime_Number| .     An example of a non-multiplicative function is the arithmetic function r 2  - the number of representations of n as a sum of squares of two integers,  |positive|Positive_Number| ,  |negative|Negative_Number| , or  |zero|0| , where in counting the number of ways, reversal of order is allowed. For example:     :1 1 2 + 0 2 2 + 0 2 0 2 + 1 2 0 2 + 2     and therefore r 2 4 ≠ 1. This shows that the function is not multiplicative. However, r 2 /4 is multiplicative.     In the  |On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences|On-Line_Encyclopedia_Of_Integer_Sequences| ,  have the keyword mult .     See  |arithmetic_function|Arithmetic_Function|  for some other examples of non-multiplicative functions.       A multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of  |prime_numbers|Prime_Number| , a consequence of the  |fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic|Fundamental_Theorem_Of_Arithmetic| . Thus, if n is a product of powers of distinct primes, say n p a q b ..., then   f f f ...     This property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation, as in the following examples for n 144 2 4 · 3 2 :   : d σ 0 σ 0 σ 0 5 · 3 15,   : σ σ 1 σ 1 σ 1 31 · 13 403,   : σ σ σ 17 · 10 170.     Similarly, we have:     :       8 · 6 48     In general, if f is a multiplicative function and a, b are any two positive integers, then   :f · f f · f.     Every completely multiplicative function is a  |homomorphism|Homomorphism|  of  |monoids|Monoid|  and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers.         If f and g are two multiplicative functions, one defines a new multiplicative function f g, the  Dirichlet convolution  of f and g, by   :   f   g     where the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n.   With this operation, the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an  |abelian_group|Abelian_Group| ; the  |identity_element|Identity_Element|  is ε. Convolution is commutative, associative, and distributive over addition.     Relations among the multiplicative functions discussed above include:     μ ε     Id k ε     1 Id   d 1 1   σ Id 1   d σ k Id k 1   Id   1 σ μ k σ k μ     The Dirichlet convolution can be defined for general arithmetic functions, and yields a ring structure, the  |Dirichlet_ring|Dirichlet_Ring| .     The  |Dirichlet_convolution|Dirichlet_Convolution|  of two multiplicative functions is again multiplicative. A proof of this fact is given by the following expansion for relatively prime a,b     :   :   f g      f g      f g      f g    .                                       More examples are shown in the article on  |Dirichlet_series|Dirichlet_Series| .     A , the polynomial ring over the  |finite_field|Finite_Field|  with q elements. A is a  |principal_ideal_domain|Principal_Ideal_Domain|  and therefore A is a  |unique_factorization_domain|Unique_Factorization_Domain| .     A complex-valued function   on A is called multiplicative if   whenever f and g are  |relatively_prime|Relatively_Prime| .     h be a polynomial arithmetic function . Its corresponding Dirichlet series is defined to be     : Dh      where for g  A, set  g q if g  0, and  g 0 otherwise.     The polynomial zeta function is then     :       Similar to the situation in , every Dirichlet series of a multiplicative function h has a product representation :     : D        where the product runs over all monic irreducible polynomials P. For example, the product representation of the zeta function is as for the integers:     :       Unlike the classical  |zeta_function|Zeta_Function| ,   is a simple rational function:     :    f        In a similar way, If f and g are two polynomial arithmetic functions, one defines f    g, the Dirichlet convolution of f and g, by     :         &   fg      &             where the sum is over all monic  |divisors|Divisor|  d of  m, or equivalently over all pairs  of monic polynomials whose product is m.
