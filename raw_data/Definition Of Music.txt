     A definition of music endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of musics basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of  |defining|Definition|  what is meant by the term  music . Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined, and there is ongoing debate. A number of explanations start with the notion of music as organized sound, but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music, such as  |human_speech|Human_Speech|  and sounds found in both  |natural|Natural_Environment|  and  |industrial|Industrial_Society|  environments . The problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of  |culture_in_music_cognition|Culture_In_Music_Cognition| .     The  Concise Oxford Dictionary  defines music as the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion . However, some music genres, such as  |noise_music|Noise_Music|  and  |musique_concrète|Musique_Concrète| , challenge these ideas by using sounds not widely considered as musical, beautiful or harmonius, like randomly produced electronic  |distortion|Distortion| ,  |feedback|Audio_Feedback| ,  |static|Noise| ,  |cacophony|Phonaesthetics| , and sounds produced using compositional processes which utilize  |indeterminacy|Indeterminacy|  .     An oft cited example of the dilemma in defining music is the work 433 by the American composer John Cage . The written score has three movements and directs the performer to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound throughout the duration of the piece, marking sections and the end by gesture. The audience hears only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue that 433 is not music because, among other reasons, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered musical and the composer and performer exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard . Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form .       Because of differing fundamental concepts of music, the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as music as that word is generally understood by Western cultures . Inuit and most North American Indian languages do not have a general term for music. Among the Aztecs , the ancient Mexican theory of rhetoric, poetry, dance, and instrumental music used the Nahuatl term In xochitl-in kwikatl to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements, and reserved the word Kwikakayotl only for the sung expressions . There is no term for music in the African languages Tiv , Yoruba , Igbo , Efik , Birom , Hausa , Idoma , Eggon or Jarawa . Many other languages have terms which only partly cover what Western culture typically means by the term music . The Mapuche of Argentina do not have a word for music, but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms , European and non-Mapuche music , ceremonial songs , and tayil .     While some languages in West Africa have no term for music, some West African languages accept the general concepts of music . Musiqi is the Persian word for the science and art of music, muzik being the sound and performance of music , though some things European-influenced listeners would include, such as Quran chanting, are excluded.       Ben Watson points out that Ludwig van Beethoven s  |Grosse_Fuge|Große_Fuge|  sounded like noise to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethovens publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling Allegro. They subsequently published it separately . Musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus  ... By all accounts there is no single and intercultural .
