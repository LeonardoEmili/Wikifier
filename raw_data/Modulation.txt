        In  |electronics|Electronics|  and  |telecommunications|Telecommunication| , modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic  |waveform|Waveform| , called the  carrier signal , with a modulating signal that typically contains information to be transmitted. Most radio systems in the 20th century used  |frequency_modulation|Frequency_Modulation|  or  |amplitude_modulation|Amplitude_Modulation|  for  |radio_broadcast|Radio_Broadcast| .     A modulator is a device that performs modulation. A demodulator  is a device that performs  |demodulation|Demodulation| , the inverse of modulation. A  |modem|Modem|   can perform both operations.     The aim of analog modulation is to transfer an  |analog|Analog_Signal|  baseband  signal, for example an audio signal or TV signal, over an analog bandpass channel at a different frequency, for example over a limited radio frequency band or a cable TV network channel. The aim of digital modulation is to transfer a  |digital|Digital_Data|  bit stream over an analog  |communication_channel|Communication_Channel| , for example over the  |public_switched_telephone_network|Public_Switched_Telephone_Network|   or over a limited radio frequency band. Analog and digital modulation facilitate  |frequency_division_multiplexing|Frequency_Division_Multiplexing|  , where several low pass information signals are transferred simultaneously over the same shared physical medium, using separate passband channels .     The aim of digital baseband modulation methods, also known as  |line_coding|Line_Coding| , is to transfer a digital bit stream over a baseband channel, typically a non-filtered copper wire such as a  |serial_bus|Serial_Bus|  or a wired  |local_area_network|Local_Area_Network| .     The aim of pulse modulation methods is to transfer a  |narrowband|Narrowband|  analog signal, for example, a phone call over a  |wideband|Wideband|  baseband channel or, in some of the schemes, as a bit stream over another  |digital_transmission|Digital_Transmission|  system.     In music synthesizers, modulation may be used to synthesize waveforms with an extensive overtone spectrum using a small number of oscillators. In this case, the  |carrier_frequency|Carrier_Frequency|  is typically in the same order or much lower than the modulating waveform .                    In  |analog|Analog_Signal|  modulation, the modulation is applied continuously in response to the analog information signal. Common analog modulation techniques include:      |Amplitude_modulation|Amplitude_Modulation|    Double-sideband modulation   Double-sideband modulation with carrier    |Double_sideband_suppressed_carrier_transmission|Double_Sideband_Suppressed_Carrier_Transmission| |_Double_sideband_reduced_carrier_transmission|Double_Sideband_Reduced_Carrier_Transmission| |_Single_sideband_modulation|Single_Sideband_Modulation|    Single-sideband modulation with carrier   Single-sideband modulation suppressed carrier modulation    |Vestigial_sideband_modulation|Vestigial_Sideband_Modulation| |_Quadrature_amplitude_modulation|Quadrature_Amplitude_Modulation| |_Angle_modulation|Angle_Modulation| , which is approximately  |constant_envelope|Constant_Envelope| |_Frequency_modulation|Frequency_Modulation| |_Phase_modulation|Phase_Modulation|    Transpositional Modulation , in which the waveform inflection is modified resulting in a signal where each quarter cycle is transposed in the modulation process. TM is a pseudo-analog modulation . Where an AM carrier also carries a phase variable phase f. TM is f               In  |digital|Digital_Data|  modulation, an analog carrier signal is modulated by a discrete signal. Digital modulation methods can be considered as digital-to-analog conversion and the corresponding  |demodulation|Demodulation|  or detection as analog-to-digital conversion. The changes in the carrier signal are chosen from a finite number of M alternative symbols .          A simple example: A telephone line is designed for transferring audible sounds, for example, tones, and not digital bits . Computers may, however, communicate over a telephone line by means of modems, which are representing the digital bits by tones, called symbols. If there are four alternative symbols , the first symbol may represent the bit sequence 00, the second 01, the third 10 and the fourth 11. If the modem plays a melody consisting of 1000 tones per second, the  |symbol_rate|Symbol_Rate|  is 1000 symbols/second, or 1000  |baud|Baud| . Since each tone represents a message consisting of two digital bits in this example, the  |bit_rate|Bit_Rate|  is twice the symbol rate, i.e. 2000 bits per second.     According to one definition of  |digital_signal|Digital_Signal| , the modulated signal is a digital signal. According to another definition, the modulation is a form of  |digital_to_analog_conversion|Digital_To_Analog_Conversion| . Most textbooks would consider digital modulation schemes as a form of  |digital_transmission|Digital_Transmission| , synonymous to  |data_transmission|Data_Transmission| ; very few would consider it as  |analog_transmission|Analog_Transmission| .         The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are based on  |keying|Keying| |PSK_|Phase_Shift_Keying| |FSK_|Frequency_Shift_Keying| |ASK_|Amplitude_Shift_Keying| |QAM_|Quadrature_Amplitude_Modulation| |binary|Binary_Numeral_System| |bits|Bit| . Usually, each phase, frequency or amplitude encodes an equal number of bits. This number of bits comprises the symbol that is represented by the particular phase, frequency or amplitude.     If the alphabet consists of M 2N alternative symbols, each symbol represents a message consisting of N bits. If the  |symbol_rate|Symbol_Rate|   is f symbols/second , the data rate is N f bit/second.     For example, with an alphabet consisting of 16 alternative symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits. Thus, the data rate is four times the baud rate.     In the case of PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet is often conveniently represented on a  |constellation_diagram|Constellation_Diagram| , showing the amplitude of the I signal at the x-axis, and the amplitude of the Q signal at the y-axis, for each symbol.         PSK and ASK, and sometimes also FSK, are often generated and detected using the principle of QAM. The I and Q signals can be combined into a  |complex_valued|Complex_Valued|  signal I+jQ . The resulting so called  |equivalent_lowpass_signal|Equivalent_Lowpass_Signal|  or  |equivalent_baseband_signal|Equivalent_Baseband_Signal|  is a complex-valued representation of the  |real_valued|Real_Valued|  modulated physical signal .     These are the general steps used by the  |modulator|Modulator|  to transmit data:   Group the incoming data bits into codewords, one for each symbol that will be transmitted.   Map the codewords to attributes, for example, amplitudes of the I and Q signals , or frequency or phase values.   Adapt  |pulse_shaping|Pulse_Shaping|  or some other filtering to limit the bandwidth and form the spectrum of the equivalent low pass signal, typically using digital signal processing.   Perform digital to analog conversion of the I and Q signals .   Generate a high-frequency sine carrier waveform, and perhaps also a cosine quadrature component. Carry out the modulation, for example by multiplying the sine and cosine waveform with the I and Q signals, resulting in the equivalent low pass signal being frequency shifted to the modulated  |passband_signal|Passband_Signal|  or  |RF_signal|Rf_Signal| . Sometimes this is achieved using DSP technology, for example  |direct_digital_synthesis|Direct_Digital_Synthesizer|  using a  |waveform_table|Waveform_Table| , instead of analog signal processing. In that case, the above DAC step should be done after this step.   Amplification and analog bandpass filtering to avoid harmonic distortion and periodic spectrum.     At the receiver side, the  |demodulator|Demodulator|  typically performs:   Bandpass filtering.    |Automatic_gain_control|Automatic_Gain_Control| , AGC .   Frequency shifting of the RF signal to the equivalent baseband I and Q signals, or to an intermediate frequency signal, by multiplying the RF signal with a local oscillator sine wave and cosine wave frequency .   Sampling and analog-to-digital conversion .   Equalization filtering, for example, a  |matched_filter|Matched_Filter| , compensation for multipath propagation, time spreading, phase distortion and frequency selective fading, to avoid  |intersymbol_interference|Intersymbol_Interference|  and symbol distortion.   Detection of the amplitudes of the I and Q signals, or the frequency or phase of the IF signal.   Quantization of the amplitudes, frequencies or phases to the nearest allowed symbol values.   Mapping of the quantized amplitudes, frequencies or phases to codewords .   Parallel-to-serial conversion of the codewords into a bit stream.   Pass the resultant bit stream on for further processing such as removal of any error-correcting codes.     As is common to all digital communication systems, the design of both the modulator and demodulator must be done simultaneously. Digital modulation schemes are possible because the transmitter-receiver pair has prior knowledge of how data is encoded and represented in the communications system. In all digital communication systems, both the modulator at the transmitter and the demodulator at the receiver are structured so that they perform inverse operations.     Asynchronous methods do not require a receiver reference clock signal that is  |phase_synchronized|Phase_Synchronisation|  with the sender  |carrier_signal|Carrier_Signal| . In this case, modulation symbols are  |asynchronously|Asynchronous_Communication|  transferred. The opposite is  |synchronous_modulation|Bit_Synchronousoperation| .         The most common digital modulation techniques are:      |Phase_shift_keying|Phase_Shift_Keying|    Binary PSK , using M2 symbols   Quadrature PSK , using M4 symbols   8PSK, using M8 symbols   16PSK, using M16 symbols   Differential PSK   Differential QPSK   Offset QPSK    π/4–QPSK    |Frequency_shift_keying|Frequency_Shift_Keying| |_Audio_frequency_shift_keying|Audio_Frequency_Shift_Keying| |_Multi_frequency_shift_keying|Multi_Frequency_Shift_Keying| |_Dual_tone_multi_frequency|Dual_Tone_Multi_Frequency| |_Amplitude_shift_keying|Amplitude_Shift_Keying| |_On_off_keying|On_Off_Keying|  , the most common ASK form   M-ary  |vestigial_sideband_modulation|Vestigial_Sideband_Modulation| , for example  |8VSB|8Vsb| |_Quadrature_amplitude_modulation|Quadrature_Amplitude_Modulation|  , a combination of PSK and ASK    |Polar_modulation|Polar_Modulation|  like QAM a combination of PSK and ASK  |Continuous_phase_modulation|Continuous_Phase_Modulation|  methods    |Minimum_shift_keying|Minimum_Shift_Keying| |_Gaussian_minimum_shift_keying|Gaussian_Minimum_Shift_Keying| |_Continuous_phase_frequency_shift_keying|Continuous_Phase_Frequency_Shift_Keying| |_Orthogonal_frequency_division_multiplexing|Orthogonal_Frequency_Division_Multiplexing|  modulation    |Discrete_multitone|Discrete_Multitone_Modulation|  , including adaptive modulation and bit-loading    |Wavelet_modulation|Wavelet_Modulation| |_Trellis_coded_modulation|Trellis_Coded_Modulation|  , also known as  |Trellis_modulation|Trellis_Modulation| |_Spread_spectrum|Spread_Spectrum|  techniques    |Direct_sequence_spread_spectrum|Direct_Sequence_Spread_Spectrum| |_Chirp_spread_spectrum|Chirp_Spread_Spectrum|  according to IEEE 802.15.4a CSS uses pseudo-stochastic coding    |Frequency_hopping_spread_spectrum|Frequency_Hopping_Spread_Spectrum|  applies a special scheme for channel release      |MSK|Minimum_Shift_Keying|  and  |GMSK|Gmsk|  are particular cases of continuous phase modulation. Indeed, MSK is a particular case of the sub-family of CPM known as  |continuous_phase_frequency_shift_keying|Continuous_Phase_Frequency_Shift_Keying|  which is defined by a rectangular frequency pulse of one-symbol-time duration .      |OFDM|Orthogonal_Frequency_Division_Multiplexing|  is based on the idea of  |frequency_division_multiplexing|Frequency_Division_Multiplexing|  , but the multiplexed streams are all parts of a single original stream. The bit stream is split into several parallel data streams, each transferred over its own sub-carrier using some conventional digital modulation scheme. The modulated sub-carriers are summed to form an OFDM signal. This dividing and recombining help with handling channel impairments. OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multiplex technique since it transfers one bit stream over one communication channel using one sequence of so-called OFDM symbols. OFDM can be extended to multi-user  |channel_access_method|Channel_Access_Method|  in the  |orthogonal_frequency_division_multiple_access|Orthogonal_Frequency_Division_Multiple_Access|  and  |multi_carrier_code_division_multiple_access|Multi_Carrier_Code_Division_Multiple_Access|  schemes, allowing several users to share the same physical medium by giving different sub-carriers or  |spreading_codes|Spreading_Code|  to different users.     Of the two kinds of  |RF_power_amplifier|Rf_Power_Amplifier| ,  |switching_amplifiers|Switching_Amplifier|   cost less and use less battery power than  |linear_amplifiers|Linear_Amplifier|  of the same output power. However, they only work with relatively constant-amplitude-modulation signals such as angle modulation and  |CDMA|Code_Division_Multiple_Access| , but not with QAM and OFDM. Nevertheless, even though switching amplifiers are completely unsuitable for normal QAM constellations, often the QAM modulation principle are used to drive switching amplifiers with these FM and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM demodulators are used to receive the signals put out by these switching amplifiers.       Automatic digital modulation recognition in intelligent communication systems is one of the most important issues in  |software_defined_radio|Software_Defined_Radio|  and  |cognitive_radio|Cognitive_Radio| . According to incremental expanse of intelligent receivers, automatic modulation recognition becomes a challenging topic in telecommunication systems and computer engineering. Such systems have many civil and military applications. Moreover, blind recognition of modulation type is an important problem in commercial systems, especially in  |software_defined_radio|Software_Defined_Radio| . Usually in such systems, there are some extra information for system configuration, but considering blind approaches in intelligent receivers, we can reduce information overload and increase transmission performance.  Obviously, with no knowledge of the transmitted data and many unknown parameters at the receiver, such as the signal power, carrier frequency and phase offsets, timing information, etc., blind identification of the modulation is made fairly difficult. This becomes even more challenging in real-world scenarios with multipath fading, frequency-selective and time-varying channels.        There are two main approaches to automatic modulation recognition. The first approach uses likelihood-based methods to assign an input signal to a proper class. Another recent approach is based on feature extraction.            The term digital baseband modulation is synonymous to  |line_codes|Line_Code| . These are methods to transfer a digital bit stream over an analog  |baseband|Baseband|  channel  using a pulse train, i.e. a discrete number of signal levels, by directly modulating the voltage or current on a cable or serial bus. Common examples are  |unipolar|Unipolar_Encoding| ,  |non_return_to_zero|Non_Return_To_Zero|  ,  |Manchester|Manchester_Coding|  and  |alternate_mark_inversion|Alternate_Mark_Inversion|  codings.                 Pulse modulation schemes aim at transferring a narrowband analog signal over an analog baseband channel as a two-level signal by modulating a  |pulse_wave|Pulse_Wave| . Some pulse modulation schemes also allow the narrowband analog signal to be transferred as a digital signal  with a fixed bit rate, which can be transferred over an underlying digital transmission system, for example, some  |line_code|Line_Code| . These are not modulation schemes in the conventional sense since they are not  |channel_coding|Channel_Coding|  schemes, but should be considered as  |source_coding|Source_Coding|  schemes, and in some cases analog-to-digital conversion techniques.
