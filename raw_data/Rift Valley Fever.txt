Rift Valley fever  is a  |viral_disease|Viral_Disease|  that can cause mild to severe symptoms. The mild symptoms may include:  |fever|Fever| ,  |muscle_pains|Myalgia| , and  |headaches|Headache|  which often last for up to a week. The severe symptoms may include: loss of sight beginning three weeks after the infection, infections of the  |brain|Brain|  causing severe headaches and  |confusion|Confusion| , and bleeding together with  |liver_problems|Liver_Problems|  which may occur within the first few days. Those who have bleeding have a chance of death as high as 50%.       The disease is caused by the RVF  |virus|Virus| , which is of the  Phlebovirus  type. It is spread by either touching infected animal blood, breathing in the air around an infected animal being  |butchered|Butchered| , drinking  |raw_milk|Raw_Milk|  from an infected animal, or the bite of infected  |mosquito|Mosquito| es.
