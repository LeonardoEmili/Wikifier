   Alpha decay or α-decay is a type of  |radioactive_decay|Radioactivity|  in which an  |atomic_nucleus|Atomic_Nucleus|  emits an  |alpha_particle|Alpha_Particle|  and thereby transforms or decays into a different atomic nucleus, with a  |mass_number|Mass_Number|  that is reduced by four and an  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  that is reduced by two. An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a  |helium-4|Helium-4|  atom, which consists of two  |protons|Proton|  and two  |neutrons|Neutron| . It has a charge of  and a mass of . For example,  |uranium-238|Uranium-238|  decays to form  |thorium-234|Thorium-234| . Alpha particles have a  |charge|Electric_Charge|  , but as a nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons – a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms – the charge is not usually shown.     Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. Theoretically, it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than  |nickel|Nickel|  , where the overall  |binding_energy|Binding_Energy|  per  |nucleon|Nucleon|  is no longer a minimum and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission-type processes. In practice, this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel, with the lightest known alpha emitters being the lightest  |isotopes|Isotope|  of  |tellurium|Tellurium|  . Exceptionally, however,  |beryllium-8|Isotopes_Of_Beryllium|  decays to two alpha particles.     Alpha decay is by far the most common form of  |cluster_decay|Cluster_Decay| , where the parent  |atom|Atom|  ejects a defined  |daughter|Decay_Product|  collection of nucleons, leaving another defined product behind. It is the most common form because of the combined extremely high  |nuclear_binding_energy|Nuclear_Binding_Energy|  and relatively small mass of the alpha particle. Like other cluster decays, alpha decay is fundamentally a  |quantum_tunneling|Quantum_Tunneling|  process. Unlike  |beta_decay|Beta_Decay| , it is governed by the interplay between both the  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force|  and the  |electromagnetic_force|Electromagnetic_Force| .      |Alpha_particles|Alpha_Particle|  have a typical kinetic energy of 5  MeV and have a speed of about 15,000,000  m/s, or 5% of the  |speed_of_light|Speed_Of_Light| . There is surprisingly small variation around this energy, due to the heavy dependence of the half-life of this process on the energy produced . Because of their relatively large mass, electric charge of  and relatively low velocity, alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy, and their forward motion can be stopped by a few centimeters of  |air|Air| . Approximately 99% of the  |helium|Helium|  produced on  |Earth|Earth|  is the result of the alpha decay of underground deposits of  |minerals|Mineral|  containing  |uranium|Uranium|  or  |thorium|Thorium| . The helium is brought to the surface as a by-product of  |natural_gas|Natural_Gas|  production.          Alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by  |Ernest_Rutherford|Ernest_Rutherford|  in 1899, and by 1907 they were identified as He 2+ ions.     By 1928,  |George_Gamow|George_Gamow|  had solved the theory of alpha decay via tunneling. The alpha particle is trapped in a  |potential_well|Potential_Well|  by the nucleus. Classically, it is forbidden to escape, but according to the newly discovered principles of  |quantum_mechanics|Quantum_Mechanics| , it has a tiny probability of  |tunneling|Quantum_Tunnelling|  through the  |barrier|Potential_Barrier|  and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived, from first principles, a relationship between the  |half-life|Half-Life|  of the decay, and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically, and was known as the  |Geiger–Nuttall_law|Geiger–Nuttall_Law| .          The  |nuclear_force|Nuclear_Force|  holding an atomic nucleus together is very strong, in general much stronger than the repulsive  |electromagnetic_forces|Electromagnetic_Force|  between the protons. However, the nuclear force is also short range, dropping quickly in strength beyond about 1  |femtometre|Femtometre| , while the electromagnetic force has unlimited range. The strength of the attractive nuclear force keeping a nucleus together is thus proportional to the number of nucleons, but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so large that the  |strong_nuclear_force|Strong_Nuclear_Force|  holding it together can just barely counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains. Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by reducing size.      One curiosity is why alpha particles, helium nuclei, should be preferentially emitted as opposed to other particles like a single  |proton|Proton_Emission|  or  |neutron|Neutron_Emission|  or  |other_atomic_nuclei|Cluster_Decay| . These other decay modes, while possible, are extremely rare compared to alpha decay. The main reason is the very high  |binding_energy|Binding_Energy|  of the alpha particle. Computing the total disintegration energy given by the equation:   : E c2   Where m  is the initial mass of the nucleus, m  is the mass of the nucleus after particle emission, and m  is the mass of the emitted particle, shows that alpha particle emission will usually be possible just with energy from the nucleus itself, while other decay modes will require additional energy. For example, performing the calculation for  |uranium-232|Uranium-232|  shows that alpha particle emission would need only 5.4  MeV, while a single proton emission would require 6.1  MeV. Most of this disintegration energy becomes the  |kinetic_energy|Kinetic_Energy|  of the alpha particle itself, although to maintain  |conservation_of_momentum|Conservation_Of_Momentum|  part of this energy becomes the recoil of the nucleus itself. However, since the mass numbers of most alpha emitting radioisotopes exceed 210, far greater than the mass number of the alpha particle the part of the energy going to the recoil of the nucleus is generally quite small.     These disintegration energies however are substantially smaller than the  |potential_barrier|Potential_Barrier|  provided by the nuclear force, which prevents the alpha particle from escaping. The energy needed is generally in the range of about 25  MeV, the amount of work that must be done against electromagnetic repulsion to bring an alpha particle from infinity to a point near the nucleus just outside the range of the nuclear forces influence. An alpha particle can be thought of as being inside a potential barrier whose walls are 25  MeV. However, decay alpha particles only have kinetic energies of 4  MeV to about 9  MeV, far less than the energy needed to escape.     Quantum mechanics, however, allows the alpha particle to escape via quantum tunneling. The quantum tunneling theory of alpha decay, independently developed by George Gamow    and  |Ronald_Wilfred_Gurney|Ronald_Wilfred_Gurney|  and  |Edward_Condon|Edward_Condon|  in 1928,  was hailed as a very striking confirmation of quantum theory. Essentially, the alpha particle escapes from the nucleus not by acquiring enough energy to pass over the wall confining it, but by tunneling through the wall. Gurney and Condon made the following observation in their paper on it:   It has hitherto been necessary to postulate some special arbitrary ‘instability’ of the nucleus; but in the following note it is pointed out that disintegration is a natural consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics without any special hypothesis... Much has been written of the explosive violence with which the & alpha;-particle is hurled from its place in the nucleus. But from the process pictured above, one would rather say that the & alpha;-particle almost slips away unnoticed.   The theory supposes that the alpha particle can be considered an independent particle within a nucleus that is in constant motion, but held within the nucleus by nuclear forces. At each collision with the potential barrier of the nuclear force, there is a small non-zero probability that it will tunnel its way out. An alpha particle with a speed of 1.5 & times;10 7  m/s within a nuclear diameter of approximately 10 −14  m will collide with the barrier more than 10 21 times per second. However, if the probability of escape at each collision is very small, the half-life of the radioisotope will be very long, since it is the time required for the total probability of escape to reach 50%. As an extreme example, the half-life of the isotope  |bismuth-209|Bismuth-209|  is 2.01 x 10 19 years.

However, only such nuclides with A 5, 8, 144, 146, 147, 148, 151, 186, and ≥ 209 have been observed to alpha decay .
