In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , the arithmetic–geometric mean  of two positive  |real_numbers|Real_Number|   and  is defined as follows:     Call  and   and  |sequences|Sequence|   and  as     :     a &     g &   ,         where the square root takes the  |principal_value|Principal_Value| . These two sequences  |converge|Limit_Of_A_Sequence|  to the same number, the arithmetic–geometric mean of  and ; it is denoted by , or sometimes by .     The arithmetic-geometric mean is used in fast  |algorithms|Algorithm|  for  |exponential|Exponential_Function|  and  |trigonometric_functions|Trigonometric_Functions| , as well as some  |mathematical_constants|Mathematical_Constant| , in particular,  |computing|Computing_Π| .       To find the arithmetic–geometric mean of  and , iterate as follows:     :     a1 & &   & & 15    g1 & &   & & 12    a2 & &   & & 13.5    g2 & &   & & 13.416  407  8649    & &   & &         The first five iterations give the following values:     :     The number of digits in which  and  agree approximately doubles with each iteration. The arithmetic–geometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences, which is approximately .  at  |Wolfram_Alpha|Wolfram_Alpha|        The first algorithm based on this sequence pair appeared in the works of  |Lagrange|Joseph-Louis_Lagrange| . Its properties were further analyzed by  |Gauss|Gauss| .  first published in  LEnseignement Mathématique , t. 30 , p. 275-330       The geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean .
