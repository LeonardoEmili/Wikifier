Latin declension is the set of patterns according to which  |Latin|Latin_Language|  words are  |declined|Declension| , or have their endings altered to show  |grammatical_case|Grammatical_Case| ,  |number|Grammatical_Number|  and  |gender|Grammatical_Gender| . Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined , and a given pattern is called a declension. There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and  |grammatical_gender|Grammatical_Gender| . Each noun follows one of the five declensions, but some irregular nouns have exceptions.     Adjectives are of two kinds: those like  good use first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. Other adjectives such as  belong to the third declension. There are no fourth- or fifth-declension adjectives.     Pronouns are also of two kinds, the personal pronouns such as  I and  you , which have their own irregular declension, and the third-person pronouns such as  this and  that which can generally be used either as pronouns or adjectivally. These latter decline in a similar way to the first and second noun declensions, but there are differences; for example the genitive singular ends in -īus or -ius instead of -ī or -ae.     The cardinal numbers  one,  two, and  three also have their own declensions , and there are also numeral adjectives such as  a pair, two each, which decline like ordinary adjectives.       A complete Latin noun declension consists of up to seven  |grammatical_cases|Grammatical_Cases| |nominative|Nominative| ,  |vocative|Vocative| ,  |accusative|Accusative| ,  |genitive|Genitive| ,  |dative|Dative| ,  |ablative|Ablative|  and  |locative|Locative| . However, the locative is limited to few nouns: generally names of cities, small islands and a few other words.     The case names are often abbreviated to the first three letters.       In Britain and countries influenced by Britain, the Latin cases are usually given in the order –––––. This order was first used in  |Benjamin_Hall_Kennedys|Benjamin_Hall_Kennedy|  Latin Primer , and it reflects the tendencies of different cases to share similar endings .     However, in American books the traditional order ––––– or its modification ––––– is found. The former is used in the well-known grammar of Gildersleeve and Lodge and was also formerly used in England, for example in The School and University Eton Latin Grammar . Mongan, James Roscoe . The School and University Eton Latin Grammar, Explanatory and Critical. London 1861. The latter, with the vocative case at the end, is used in Allen and Greenoughs New Latin Grammar and in  |Wheelocks_Latin|Wheelocks_Latin|  .     Whichever order is used in grammars, in dictionaries nouns are always cited using the nominative and genitive singular, for example  king . From the genitive ending  it can be discovered whether the noun is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th declension.     For further information about the various orders, see  |below|Order_Of_The_Cases| .        |Syncretism|Syncretism| , where one form in a paradigm shares the ending of another form in the paradigm, is common in Latin. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:       For pure Latin neuter nouns, the nominative singular, vocative singular, and accusative singular are identical; and the nominative plural, vocative plural, and accusative plural all end in -a .       The vocative form is always the same as the nominative in the plural, and usually the same as the nominative in the singular except for second-declension masculine nouns ending in -us and a few nouns of Greek origin. For example, the vocative of the first-declension  is .   The genitive singular is the same as the nominative plural in first-, second-, and fourth-declension masculine and feminine pure Latin nouns.   The dative singular is the same as the genitive singular in first- and fifth-declension pure Latin nouns.   The dative is always the same as the ablative in the singular in the second declension, the third-declension full i-stems , and fourth-declension neuters.   The dative, ablative, and locative are always identical in the plural.   The locative is identical to the ablative in the fourth and fifth declensions.        |Old_Latin|Old_Latin|  had essentially two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, which derived from the Proto-Indo-European  |thematic|Thematic_Vowel|  declension. The other pattern was used by the third, fourth and fifth declensions, and derived from the athematic PIE declension.       There are two principal parts for Latin nouns: the nominative singular and the genitive singular. Each declension can be unequivocally identified by the ending of the genitive singular . The stem of the noun can be identified by the form of the genitive singular as well.     There are five declensions for Latin nouns:      First declension  -a in the nominative singular and are mostly feminine, e.g.   and   . There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g.   ,   and   .     The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is a. The nominative singular form consists of the  |stem|Stem|  and the  |ending|Suffixinflectional_Suffixes|  -a, and the genitive singular form is the stem plus -ae.              The locative endings for the first declension are -ae and -īs , similar to the genitive singular and ablative plural, as in  in war and  at Athens. Allen and Greenough. §43 c.      First declension Greek nouns      The first declension also includes three types of  |Greek|Ancient_Greek|  loanwords, derived from Ancient Greeks  |Alpha_Declension|Ancient_Greek_Nounsfirst_Declension| . They are declined irregularly in the singular, but sometimes treated as native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative  instead of the original athlētēs. Archaic  first declension Greek nouns and adjectives had been formed in exactly the same way as in Latin: nephelēgeréta Zeus  had in classical Greek become nephelēgerétēs.     For full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix  |First_declension|Wiktionary:Appendix:Latin_First_Declension| .      Second declension   and  and neuter nouns like  . There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of  |gemstones|Gemstone| , plants, trees, and some towns and cities.     In the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the  |stem|Stem|  and the  |ending|Suffixinflectional_Suffixes|  -us, although some end in -er, which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending -um. However, every second-declension noun has the ending -ī attached as a suffix to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is o.                  The locative endings for the second declension are -ī and -īs ;  at Corinth ,  at Milan , and  at Philippi . Allen and Greenough. §49 a.      Second-declension -ius and -ium nouns -ius and -ium have a genitive singular in -ī in earlier Latin, which was regularized to -iī in the later language. Masculine nouns in -ius have a vocative singular in -ī at all stages. These forms in -ī are stressed on the same syllable as the nominative singular, sometimes in violation of the usual Latin stress rule. For example, the genitive and vocative singular Vergilī  is pronounced Vergílī, with stress on the penult, even though it is short. Gildersleeve & Lodge §15, Allen & Greenough §12, §49c In Old Latin, however, the vocative was declined regularly, using -ie instead, e.g. fīlie son , archaic vocative of fīlius.     There is no contraction of -iī in plural forms and in the locative.          In the older language, nouns ending with -vus, -quus and -vum take o rather than u in the nominative and accusative singular. For example,  could be servos, accusative servom.      Second-declension -r nouns -er or -ir in the nominative singular. For such nouns, the genitive singular must be learned to see if the e is dropped. For example,  keeps its e. However, the noun  drops its e in the genitive singular. Nouns with -ir in the nominative singular, such as , never drop the i.     The declension of second-declension -r nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, except that the vocative suffix -e is optional.     For declension tables of second-declension nouns, see the  |corresponding_Wiktionary_appendix|Wiktionary:Appendix:Latin_Second_Declension| .           Second-declension Greek nouns      The second declension contains two types of masculine Greek nouns and one form of neuter Greek noun. These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first-declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from the  |Omicron_declension|Ancient_Greek_Nounssecond_Declension| .     Some Greek nouns may also be declined as normal Latin nouns. For example,  can appear as theātrum.      Irregular forms  is irregular. The vocative singular of deus is not attested in Classical Latin. In  |Ecclesiastical_Latin|Ecclesiastical_Latin|  the vocative of Deus is Deus.     In poetry, -um may substitute -ōrum as the genitive plural ending.          vīrus  means 1. slimy liquid, slime; 2. poison, venom , denoting the venom of a snake. This Latin word is probably related to the  |Greek|Greek_Language|    meaning venom or rust and the  |Sanskrit|Sanskrit|  word   meaning toxic, poison . Chamberss Etymological Dictionary Enlarged Edition 1931     Since vīrus in antiquity denoted something uncountable, it was a  |mass_noun|Mass_Noun| . Mass nouns pluralize only under special circumstances, hence the non-existence of plural forms in the texts. June 1999 issue of ASM News by the American Society for Microbiology     In  |Neo-Latin|New_Latin_Language| , a plural form is necessary in order to express the modern concept of ‘viruses’, which leads to the following declension:  William T. Stearn: Botanical Latin. History, Grammar, Syntax, Terminology and Vocabulary. David & Charles, third edition, 1983. Quote: Virus: virus , gen. sing. viri, nom. pl. vira, gen. pl. vīrorum .              Third declension-a, -e, -ī, -ō, -y, -c, -l, -n, -r, -s, -t, or -x. This group of nouns includes masculine, neuter, and feminine nouns.       The stem of a consonant-stem noun may be found from the genitive case by removing the ending -is. For example, the stem of  peace is pāc-.     Examples are   river,   flower, and   peace.     Masculine, feminine and neuter nouns often have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, many masculine nouns end in -or . Many feminine nouns end in -īx , and many neuter nouns end in -us with an r stem in the oblique cases .                    The locative endings for the third declension are -ī or -e and -ibus , as in  in the country and  at Tralles. Allen and Greenough. §80.      Third declension i-stem and mixed nouns i-stems. i-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure i-stems are indicated by special neuter endings. Mixed i-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule. Stems indicated by the parisyllabic rule are usually mixed, occasionally pure.   ;Masculine and feminine   :Parisyllabic rule: Some masculine and feminine third-declension i-stem nouns have the same number of syllables in the genitive as they do in the nominative. For example:  ;  . The nominative ends in -is or -ēs.   :Double consonant rule: The rest of the masculine and feminine third-declension i-stem nouns have two consonants before the -is in the genitive singular. For example:  .   ;Neuter   :Special neuter ending: Neuter third-declension i-stems have no rule. However, all of them end in -al, -ar or -e. For example:  ;  ;  .     The mixed declension is distinguished from the consonant type only by having -ium in the genitive plural . The pure declension is characterized by having -ī in the ablative singular, -ium in the genitive plural, -ia in the nominative and accusative plural neuter, and -im in the accusative singular masculine and feminine .     The accusative plural ending -īs is found in early Latin up to  |Virgil|Virgil| , but from the early empire onwards it was replaced by -ēs. Gildersleeve & Lodge , p. 18.     The accusative singular ending -im is found only in a few words: always in  cough,  thirst,  River Tiber; usually in  axe,  tower; occasionally in  ship. Most nouns, however, have accusative singular -em. Gildersleeve & Lodge , p. 27.     The ablative singular -ī is found in nouns which have -im, and also, optionally, in some other nouns, e.g.  or  in the fire.     There are two mixed-declension neuter nouns:  and  . Also, the mixed declension is used in the plural-only adjective  .                    The rules for determining i-stems from non-i-stems and mixed i-stems are guidelines rather than rules: many words that might be expected to be i-stems according to the parisyllabic rule actually are not, such as  or  , which have genitive plural  of dogs and  of young men. Likewise,  ,  ,  , and  violate the double-consonant rule. This fluidity even in Roman times resulted in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin.     Some nouns in -tāt-, such as  city, community can have either consonant-stem or i-stem genitive plural:  or  of the cities. Gildersleeve & Lodge , p. 18.       In the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.            Fourth declension    and   with a few feminine exceptions, including   . The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns including   . Each noun has the ending -ūs as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is u, but the declension is otherwise very similar to the third-declension i stems.           In the dative and ablative plural, -ibus is sometimes replaced with -ubus. This is so for only a few nouns, such as  , .     The locative endings for the fourth declension are -ī , and probably -ū as well;  at senate ,  at home .      is an irregular noun, mixing fourth and second declension nouns at the same time . However, in practice, it is generally declined as a regular -us stem fourth declension noun .                  Fifth declension    and diēs, diēī  . Each noun has either the ending -ēī or -eī as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form.           Nouns ending in -iēs have long ēī in the dative and genitive, while nouns ending in a consonant + -ēs have short eī in these cases.     The locative ending of the fifth declension was -ē , identical to the ablative singular, as in  .           The first and second persons are irregular, and both pronouns are indeclinable for gender; and the third person reflexive pronoun sē, suī always refers back to the subject, regardless of whether the subject is singular or plural.          The genitive forms , , , ,  are used as complements in certain grammatical constructions, whereas ,  are used with a  |partitive|Partitive|  meaning . To express possession, the possessive pronouns , , ,  are used, declined in the first and second declensions to agree in number and case with the thing possessed, e.g. pater meus my father, māter mea my mother. The vocative singular masculine of meus is mīmī Attice my dear Atticus.  |Cicero|Cicero| ,  Epistulae ad Atticum  6.1.20 etc.                     The possessive adjective vester has an archaic variant, voster; similar to noster.        Usually, to show the ablative of accompaniment,  would be added to the ablative form. However, with personal pronouns , the reflexive and the interrogative, -cum is added onto the end of the ablative form. That is:  with me,  with us,  with you, ,  and  .     Pronouns have also an emphatic form bi using the suffix -met , used in all cases, except by the genitive plural forms.     In accusative case, the forms mēmē and tētē exist as emphatic, but they are not widely used.      has a possessive adjective: , meaning his/her/its/their own:     :Patrem suum numquam vīderat.   |Cicero|Cicero| ,  Pro Rabirio Postumo  4   : He had never seen his father.     When his or her refers to someone else, not the subject, the genitive pronoun eius  of him is used instead of suusFit obviam Clodiō ante fundum eius.   |Cicero|Cicero| ,  Pro Milone  29   : He met Clodius in front of the latters farm.     When one sentence is embedded inside another with a different subject, sē and suus can refer to either subject:   :Patrēs conscrīptī ... lēgātōs in Bīthȳniam miserunt quī ab rēge peterent, nē inimīcissimum suum secum haberet sibique dēderet.   |Cornelius_Nepos|Cornelius_Nepos| , Hannibal 12.2   : The senators ... sent ambassadors to Bithynia, who were to ask the king not to keep their greatest enemy with him but hand him over to them.     For the third-person pronoun  he, see below.         Relative, demonstrative and indefinite pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:   the nominatives are often irregular   the genitive singular ends in -īus rather than -ae or -ī.   the dative singular ends in -ī-ae or -ō.     These differences characterize the pronominal declension, and a few special adjectives  are also declined according to this pattern.     All demonstrative, relative, and indefinite pronouns in Latin can also be used adjectivally, with some small differences; for example in the interrogative pronoun,  who? and  what? are usually used for the pronominal form,  and  which? for the adjectival form.       The weak demonstrative pronoun , ,  that also serves as the third person pronoun he, she, it:          This pronoun is also often used adjectivally, e.g. is homo that man, ea pecunia that money. It has no possessive adjective; the genitive is used instead: pater eius his/her father; pater eōrum their father.     īdem  means the same. It is derived from is with the suffix -dem. However, some forms have been  |assimilated|Assimilation| .                        Similar in declension is  another.              The interrogative pronouns are used strictly for asking questions. They are distinct from the relative pronoun and the interrogative adjective . Interrogative pronouns rarely occur in the plural. The plural interrogative pronouns are the same as the plural relative pronouns.                        First- and second-declension adjective are inflected in the masculine, the feminine and the neuter; the masculine form typically ends in -us , the feminine form ends in -a, and the neuter form ends in -um. Therefore, some adjectives are given like .     Adjectives ending -ius use the vocative -ie , just as in Old Latin all -ius nouns did .             -r adjectives -er. As with second-declension -r nouns, some adjectives retain the e throughout inflection, and some omit it.  omits its e while  keeps it.             Nine first and second declension pronominal adjectives are irregular in the genitive and the dative in all genders. They can be remembered by using the mnemonic acronym ūnus nauta. They are:      any;    no, none;    which either;    sole, alone;    neither;    another ; Gildersleeve & Lodge , Gildersleeves Latin Grammar, p. 39.    one;    whole;    other          Third-declension adjectives are normally declined like third-declension i-stem nouns, except for the fact they usually have -ī rather than -e in the ablative singular . Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending  , have -e in the ablative singular, -um in the genitive plural, and -a in the nominative and accusative neuter plural.        These have a single nominative ending for all genders, although as usual the endings for the other cases vary. As with nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of showing the inflection.          i-stem variant       Third-declension adjectives that have two endings have one form for the masculine and feminine, and a separate form for the neuter. The ending for the masculine and feminine is -is, and the ending for the neuter is -e. It is not necessary to give the genitive, as it is the same as the nominative masculine singular.          Third-declension adjectives with three endings have three separate nominative forms for all three genders. Like third and second declension -r nouns, the masculine ends in -er. The feminine ends in -ris, and the neuter ends in -re. The genitive is the same as the nominative feminine singular.          As in English, adjectives have superlative and comparative forms. For regular first and second declension and third declension adjectives with one or two endings, the comparative is formed by adding -ior for the masculine and feminine, and -ius for the neuter to the stem. The genitives for both are formed by adding -iōris. Therefore, they are declined in the third declension, but they are not declined as i-stems. Superlatives are formed by adding -issimus, -issima, -issimum to the stem and are thus declined like first and second declension adjectives.                      -er adjectives -er are slightly different. As with normal adjectives, the comparative is formed by adding -ior to the stem, but for the superlative, -rimus is added to the nominative masculine singular.          -lis adjectives -lis in the masculine–feminine nominative singular have irregular superlative forms. The following are the only adjectives that do.          -eus/-ius adjectives -eus or -ius are unusual in that they do not form the comparative and superlative by taking endings at all. Instead, and , the comparative and superlative degrees of , respectively, are used.     Many adjectives in -uus, except those in -quus or -guus, also follow this rule.           As in most languages, Latin has adjectives that have irregular comparatives and superlatives.                 There are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are cardinal numerals and ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals, e.g., distributive numerals and adverbial numerals.       All cardinal numerals are indeclinable, except , , , plural hundreds , etc., and , which have cases and genders like adjectives. is declined like a first- and second-declension pronoun with -īus in the genitive, and -ī in the dative. is declined irregularly, is declined like a third-declension plural adjective, -centī numerals decline like first- and second-declension adjectives, and is invariable in the singular and declined like a third-declension i-stem neuter noun in the plural:     The existence of plural endings for ūnus might seem unnecessary; however, they are used with pluralia tantum nouns, e. g. ūna castra , ūnae scālae .       The word , is declined like duo except that its o is long. Both declensions derive from the Indo-European dual number , otherwise defunct in Latin, rather than the plural.             The numeral is indeclinable, but all the other hundred numerals are declinable.         The word mīlle thousand is a singular indeclinable adjective. However, its plural, mīlia, is a plural third-declension i-stem neuter noun. To write the phrase four thousand horses in Latin, the genitive is used: quattuor mīlia equōrum, literally, four thousands of horses .         The rest of the numbers are indeclinable whether used as adjectives or as nouns.     For further information on the different sets of Latin numerals, see Latin numerals .       Adverbs are not declined. However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.       First and second declension adjectives adverbs are formed by adding -ē onto their stems.         Typically, third declension adjectives adverbs are formed by adding -iter to the stem. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add -er to the stem.           Adverbs comparative forms are identical to the nominative neuter singular of the corresponding comparative adjective. Adverbs superlative forms are simply formed by attaching the regular ending -ē to the corresponding superlative adjective. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, first and second declensions adjectives ending in -eus or -ius use and as opposed to distinct endings.           As with adjectives, there are irregular adverbs with peculiar comparative and superlative forms.               Some nouns are only used in the singular such as:   materials, such as gold   Some nouns are only used in the plural , or when plural have a singular meaning such as:   many festivals, such as Saturnalia   camp and arms; a letter   a few geographical names are plural such as Thebes       Indeclinable nouns are nouns which only have one form in all cases .           ,         Heterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.     A few nouns in the second declension occur in both the neuter and masculine. However, their meanings remain the same.   Some nouns are one gender in the singular, but become another gender in the plural. They may also change in meaning.                   In modern textbooks of Latin, there is no single international standard for the sequence of cases.       This order reflects the syncretic trends of different cases to share similar endings. Usually the vocative and locative cases are omitted because they appear in the paradigm of only a few word classes and are dealt with separately. This makes the paradigm appear normally in the format ––––, which is also roughly the order of how frequently the cases appear in Latin text, meaning that the cases are introduced in teaching in this order. This paradigm has been the usual order in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy s Latin Primer . It is the only method nowadays used in Hungary . It is also usual in France Paul Crouzet , Grammaire Latine, simple et complète, p. 7. and Belgium . See External links: Rosa.       This alternative sequence arose from Byzantine grammarians who were originally writing about Greek. It is standard in the United States , although modern texts increasingly move the vocative at the end to minimize disruption to the declensions in which it is identical to the nominative; some introductory texts such as  |Wheelocks_Latin|Wheelocks_Latin|  almost entirely ignore the vocative and locative except for a few brief notes, giving the format –––––. This paradigm is also used in  |Poland|Poland| , as it closely corresponds to the  |conventional_case_order|Polish_Languagenouns_And_Adjectives|  in the  |Polish_language|Polish_Language| , except for the latters use of an  |instrumental_case|Instrumental_Case|  instead of an  |ablative|Ablative_Case| . The same sequence is predominant in the  |Netherlands|Netherlands| , although the modern  |Dutch_language|Dutch_Language|  has largely lost its  |case_system|Dutch_Declension| ; instead, the rationale is that this general order is convenient for the consistent teaching of three different commonly studied declensional languages: Latin,  |Ancient_Greek|Ancient_Greek_Grammarnouns| , and  |modern_German|German_Language| . The order ––––– is also used in  |Germany|Germany|  itself to echo the conventional order of  |German_cases|German_Grammarcases|  , and also in  |Lithuania|Lithuania|  because the conventional order of Lithuanian noun cases is the same. The locative is dealt with separately as it is seldom used in Latin and might be considered to be on the verge of extinction in Classical Latin.     The order ––––– is the standard order used in Greece and  |Italy|Italy|  . Here again, the locative is dealt with separately.       Brazilian grammarian  |Napoleão_Mendes|Napoleão_Mendes|  used the unusual sequence –––––. The Latinum podcast uses ––––– .
