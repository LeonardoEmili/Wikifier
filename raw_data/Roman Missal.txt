   The Roman Missal  is the  |liturgical_book|Liturgical_Books_Of_The_Roman_Rite|  that contains the texts and  |rubrics|Rubric|  for the celebration of the  |Mass|Mass|  in the  |Roman_Rite|Roman_Rite|  of the  |Catholic_Church|Roman_Catholic_Church| .           Before the high  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , several books were used at Mass: a  |Sacramentary|Sacramentary|  with the  |prayers|Prayer| , one or more books for the  |Scriptural|Bible|  readings, and one or more books for the  |antiphons|Antiphon|  and other chants. Gradually, manuscripts came into being that incorporated parts of more than one of these books, leading finally to versions that were complete in themselves. Such a book was referred to as a Missale Plenum .     In 1223 Saint  |Francis_of_Assisi|Francis_Of_Assisi|  instructed his friars to adopt the form that was in use at the Papal Court . They adapted this missal further to the needs of their largely itinerant apostolate.  |Pope_Gregory_IX|Pope_Gregory_Ix|  considered, but did not put into effect, the idea of extending this missal, as revised by the  |Franciscans|Franciscan| , to the whole Western Church; and in 1277  |Pope_Nicholas_III|Pope_Nicholas_Iii|  ordered it to be accepted in all churches in the city of Rome. Its use spread throughout Europe, especially after the invention of the  |printing_press|Gutenberg_Press| ; but the editors introduced variations of their own choosing, some of them substantial. Printing also favoured the spread of other liturgical texts of less certain orthodoxy. The  |Council_of_Trent|Council_Of_Trent|  determined that an end must be put to the resulting disparities.     The first printed Missale Romanum , containing the Ordo Missalis secundum consuetudinem Curiae Romanae , was produced in  |Milan|Milan|  in 1474.  Almost a whole century passed before the appearance of an edition officially published by order of the  |Holy_See|Holy_See| . During that interval, the 1474 Milanese edition was followed by at least 14 other editions: 10 printed in  |Venice|Venice| , 3 in  |Paris|Paris| , 1 in  |Lyon|Lyon| . Manlio Sodi and Achille Maria Triacca, Missale Romanum: Editio Princeps  , p. XV For lack of a controlling authority, these editions differ, sometimes considerably.     Annotations in the hand of  |Cardinal|Cardinal| |Gugliemo_Sirleto|Gugliemo_Sirleto|  in a copy of the 1494 Venetian edition Missale secundum morem Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae show that it was used for drawing up the 1570 official edition of  |Pope_Pius_V|Pope_Pius_V| . In substance, this 1494 text is identical with that of the 1474 Milanese edition.           Implementing the decision of the Council of Trent,  |Pope_Pius_V|Pope_Pius_V|  promulgated, in the Apostolic Constitution  Quo primum  of 14 July 1570, an edition of the Roman Missal that was to be in obligatory use throughout the  |Latin_Church|Latin_Church|  except where there was another liturgical rite that could be proven to have been in use for at least two centuries.     Some corrections to Pope Pius Vs text proved necessary, and  |Pope_Clement_VIII|Pope_Clement_Viii|  replaced it with a new typical edition of the Roman Missal on 7 July 1604. A further revised typical edition was promulgated by  |Pope_Urban_VIII|Pope_Urban_Viii|  on 2 September 1634.     Beginning in the late seventeenth century, France and neighbouring areas saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by  |Jansenism|Jansenism|  and  |Gallicanism|Gallicanism| . This ended when Bishop  |Pierre-Louis_Parisis|Pierre-Louis_Parisis|  of Langres and  |Abbot_Guéranger|Abbot_Guéranger|  initiated in the nineteenth century a campaign to return to the Roman Missal.  |Pope_Leo_XIII|Pope_Leo_Xiii|  then took the opportunity to issue in 1884 a new typical edition that took account of all the changes introduced since the time of Pope Urban VIII.  |Pope_Pius_X|Pope_Pius_X|  also undertook a revision of the Roman Missal, which was published and declared typical by his successor  |Pope_Benedict_XV|Pope_Benedict_Xv|  on 25 July 1920.        Though Pope Pius Xs revision made few corrections, omissions, and additions to the text of the prayers in the Roman Missal, there were major changes in the rubrics, changes which were not incorporated in the section entitled Rubricae generales , but were instead printed as an additional section under the heading Additiones et variationes in rubricis Missalis.     In contrast, the revision by  |Pope_Pius_XII|Pope_Pius_Xii| , though limited to the liturgy of only five days of the Churchs year, was much bolder, requiring changes even to  |canon_law|Canon_Law| , which until then had prescribed that, with the exception of Midnight Mass for Christmas, Mass should not begin more than one hour before dawn or later than one hour after midday. In the part of the Missal thus thoroughly revised, he anticipated some of the changes affecting all days of the year after the  |Second_Vatican_Council|Second_Vatican_Council| . These novelties included the first official introduction of the  |vernacular|Vernacular|  language into the liturgy for renewal of baptismal promises within the  |Easter_Vigil|Easter_Vigil|  celebration.       Pope Pius XII issued no new typical edition of the Roman Missal, but authorized printers to replace the earlier texts for  |Palm_Sunday|Palm_Sunday| ,  |Holy_Thursday|Maundy_Thursday| ,  |Good_Friday|Good_Friday| , and the  |Easter_Vigil|Easter_Vigil|  with those that he began to introduce in 1951 and that he made universally obligatory in 1955.
