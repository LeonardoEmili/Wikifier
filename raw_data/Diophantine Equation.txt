        In  |mathematics|Mathematics| , a Diophantine equation is a  |polynomial_equation|Polynomial_Equation| , usually in two or more  |unknowns|Equation| , such that only the  |integer|Integer| |solutions|Zero_Of_A_Functionpolynomial_Roots|  are sought or studied . A linear Diophantine equation equates the sum of two or more  |monomials|Monomials| , each of  |degree|Degree_Of_A_Polynomial|  1 in one of the variables, to a constant. An exponential Diophantine equation is one in which exponents on terms can be unknowns.     Diophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an  |algebraic_curve|Algebraic_Curve| ,  |algebraic_surface|Algebraic_Surface| , or more general object, and ask about the  |lattice_points|Lattice_Point|  on it.     The word Diophantine refers to the  |Hellenistic_mathematician|Greek_Mathematicshellenistic|  of the 3rd century,  |Diophantus|Diophantus|  of  |Alexandria|Alexandria| , who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce  |symbolism|Mathematical_Symbol|  into  |algebra|Algebra| . The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called Diophantine analysis.     While individual equations present a kind of puzzle and have been considered throughout history, the formulation of general theories of Diophantine equations  was an achievement of the twentieth century.       In the following Diophantine equations, , , , and  are the unknowns and the other letters are given constants:        Linear Diophantine equations, where ,  and  are given integers. The solutions are described by the following theorem:   :This Diophantine equation has a solution  if and only if  is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of  and . Moreover, if  is a solution, then the other solutions have the form , where  is an arbitrary integer, and  and  are the quotients of  and   by the greatest common divisor of  and .     Proof: If  is this greatest common divisor,  |Bézouts_identity|Bézouts_Identity|  asserts the existence of integers  and  such that . If  is a multiple of , then  for some integer , and  is a solution. On the other hand, for every pair of integers  and , the greatest common divisor  of  and  divides . Thus, if the equation has a solution, then  must be a multiple of . If  and , then for every solution , we have   :,   showing that  is another solution. Finally, given two solutions such that , one deduces that . As  and  are  |coprime|Coprime| ,  |Euclids_lemma|Euclids_Lemma|  shows that  divides , and thus that   there exists an integer  such that  and . Therefore,  and , which completes the proof.         The  |Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese_Remainder_Theorem|  describes an important class of linear Diophantine systems of equations: let  be   |pairwise_coprime|Pairwise_Coprime|  integers greater than one,  be  arbitrary integers, and  be the product . The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that the following linear Diophantine system has exactly one solution  such that , which needed more than three centuries of mathematicians efforts for being solved.     For degrees higher than three, most known results are theorems asserting that there are no solutions or that the number of solutions is finite .     For the degree three, there are general solving methods, which work on almost all equations that are encountered in practice, but no algorithm is known that works for every cubic equation.       Homogeneous Diophantine equations of degree two are easier to solve. The standard solving method proceed in two steps. One has first to find one solution, or to prove that there is no solution. When a solution has been found, all solutions are then deduced.     For proving that there is no solution, one may reduce the equation  |modulo|Modular_Arithmetic| . For example, the Diophantine equation   : x2+y23z2,   does not have any other solution than the trivial solution . In fact, by dividing  and  by their  |greatest_common_divisor|Greatest_Common_Divisor| , one may suppose that they are  |coprime|Coprime| . The squares modulo 4 are congruent to 0 and 1. Thus the left-hand side of the equation is congruent to 0, 1, or 2, and the right-hand side is congruent to 0 or 3. Thus the equality may be obtained only if  and  are all even, and are thus not coprime. Thus the only solution is the trivial solution . This shows that there is no  |rational_point|Rational_Point|  on a  |circle|Circle|  of radius   centered at the origin.     More generally,  |Hasse_principle|Hasse_Principle|  allows deciding whether a homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two has an integer solution, and computing a solution if there exist.     If a non-trivial integer solution is known, one may produce all other solutions in the following way.       Let   : Q0   be a homogeneous Diophantine equation, where Q is a  |quadratic_form|Quadratic_Form|  , with integer coefficients. The trivial solution is the solution where all xi are zero. If is a non-trivial integer solution of this equation, then   are the  |homogeneous_coordinates|Homogeneous_Coordinates|  of a  |rational_point|Rational_Point|  of the hypersurface defined by . Conversely, if   are homogeneous coordinates of a rational point of this hypersurface, where q, p1,   pn are integers, then   is an integer solution of the Diophantine equation. Moreover, the integer solutions that define a given rational point are all sequences of the form   :     where  is any integer, and  is the greatest common divisor of the p1.     It follows that solving the Diophantine equation Q0 is completely reduced to finding the rational points of the corresponding projective hypersurface.         Let now A  be an integer solution of the equation Q0. As  is a polynomial of degree two, a line passing through  crosses the hypersurface at a single other point, which is rational if and only if the line is rational . This allows parameterizing the hypersurface by the lines passing through , and the rational points are the those that are obtained from rational lines, that is, those that correspond to rational values of the parameters.     More precisely, one may proceed as follows.     By permuting the indices, one may suppose, without loss of generality that an  0. Then one may pass to the affine case by considering the  |affine_hypersurface|Affine_Algebraic_Variety|  defined by   : qQ,   which has the rational point   : R       If this rational point is a  |singular_point|Singular_Point_Of_An_Algebraic_Variety| , that is if all  |partial_derivatives|Partial_Derivative|  are zero at , all lines passing through  are contained in the hypersurface, and one has a  |cone|Conical_Surface| . The change of variables   : yixi-ri   does not change the rational points, and transforms  into a homogeneous polynomial in  variables. In this case, the problem may thus be solved by applying the method to an equation with fewer variables.     If the polynomial  is a product of linear polynomials , then it defines two  |hyperplanes|Hyperplane| . The intersection of these hyperplanes is a rational  |flat|Flat| , and contains rational singular points. This case is thus a special instance of the preceding case.     In the general case, let consider the  |parametric_equation|Parametric_Equation|  of a line passing through , one gets a polynomial of degree two in x1, that is zero for x1r1. It is thus divisible by x1-r1, . The quotient is linear in x1, and may be solved for expressing x1 as a quotient of two polynomials of degree at most two in t2,   t, with integer coefficients:   : x1    Substituting this in the expressions for x2,   x, one gets, for ,   : xi    where f1,   fn are polynomials of degree at most two with integer coefficients.     Then, one can return to the homogeneous case. Let, for ,   : Fit12 fi    be the  |homogenization|Homogenization_Of_A_Polynomial|  of fi. These quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients form a parameterization of the projective hypersurface defined by  is rational if and only if it may be obtained from rational values of t1,   t. As F1,   are homogeneous polynomials, the point is not changed if all ti are multiplied by the same rational number. Thus, one may suppose that t1,   t are  |coprime_integers|Coprime_Integers| . It follows that the integer solutions of the Diophantine equation are exactly the sequences where, for ,   : xi k    where  is an integer, t1,   t are coprime integers, and  is the greatest common divisor of the  integers Fi.     One could hope that the coprimality of the ti could imply that . Unfortunately this is not the case, as shown in the next section.       The equation   : x2+y2-z20   is probably the first homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two that has been studied. Its solutions are the  |Pythagorean_triples|Pythagorean_Triple| . This is also the homogeneous equation of the  |unit_circle|Unit_Circle| . In this section, we show how the above method allows retrieving  |Euclids_formula|Euclids_Formula|  for generating Pythagorean triples.     For retrieving exactly Euclids formula, we start from the solution , corresponding to the point  of the unit circle. A line passing through this point may be parameterized by its slope:   : yt.   Putting this in the circle equation   : x2+y2-10,   one gets   : x2-1 +t220.   Dividing by , results in   : x-1+t20,   which is easy to solve in  is any integer,  and  are coprime integers, and  is the greatest common divisor of the three numerators. In fact,  if  and  are both odd, and  if one is odd and the other is even.     The primitive triples are the solutions where  and .
