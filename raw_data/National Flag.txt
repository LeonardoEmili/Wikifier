   A national flag is a  |flag|Flag|  that represents and symbolizes a  |country|Country| . The national flag is  |flown|Fly|  by the  |government|Government|  of a country, but can usually also be flown by  |citizens|Citizen|  of the country. A national flag is designed with specific meanings for its colours and symbols. The colours of the national flag may be worn by the people of a nation to show their patriotism, or related paraphernalia that show the symbols or colours of the flag may be used for those purposes.     The design of a national flag may be altered after the occurrence of important historical events. The  |burning_or_destruction_of_a_national_flag|Flag_Desecration|  is a greatly symbolic act.          Historically, flags originate as  |military_standards|Military_Standard| , used as  |field_signs|Field_Sign| . The practice of flying flags indicating the country of origin outside of the context of warfare became common with the  |maritime_flag|Maritime_Flag| , introduced during the  |age_of_sail|Age_Of_Sail| , in the early 17th century. The origins of the  |Union_Jack|Union_Jack|  flag date back to 1603, when  |James_VI_of_Scotland|James_Vi_Of_Scotland|  inherited the English and Irish thrones , thereby  |uniting_the_crowns|Union_Of_The_Crowns|  of  |England|England| ,  |Scotland|Scotland|  and  |Ireland|Kingdom_Of_Ireland|  in a  |personal_union|Personal_Union|  . On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the  |flag_of_England|Flag_Of_England|  , and the  |flag_of_Scotland|Flag_Of_Scotland|  , would be joined together, forming the flag of Great Britain and first Union Flag.     With the emergence of  |nationalist|Nationalism|  sentiment from the late 18th century national flags began to be displayed in civilian contexts as well.  Notable early examples include the  |US_flag|Us_Flag| , which was first adopted as a naval ensign in 1777 but began to be displayed as a generic symbol of the  |United_States|United_States|  after the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| , and the  |French_Tricolore|French_Tricolore| , which became a symbol of the  |Republic|First_French_Republic|   in the 1790s.     Most  |countries_of_Europe|Countries_Of_Europe|  adopted a national flag in the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, often based on older war flags. The specifications of the  |flag_of_Denmark|Flag_Of_Denmark|  were codified in 1748, based on a 14th-century design.  The  |flag_of_Switzerland|Flag_Of_Switzerland|  was introduced in 1889, also based on medieval war flags. The  |Netherlands|Flag_Of_The_Kingdom_Of_The_Netherlands|  introduced two national flags in 1813 .     The  |Ottoman_flag|Flags_Of_The_Ottoman_Empire|   was adopted in 1844. Other non-European powers followed the trend in the late 19th century, the  |flag_of_Japan|Flag_Of_Japan|  being introduced in 1870, that of  |Qing_China|Qing_China|  in 1890.   Also in the 19th century, most  |countries_of_South_America|Countries_Of_South_America|  introduced a flag as they became independent           The national flag is often, but not always, mentioned or described in a countrys  |constitution|Constitution| , but its detailed description may be delegated to a flag law passed by the legislative, or even  |secondary_legislation|Delegated_Legislation|  or in monarchies a  |decree|Order_In_Council| .     Thus, the national flag is mentioned briefly in the  |Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany|Basic_Law_For_The_Federal_Republic_Of_Germany|  of 1949 the federal flag is black-red-gold , but its proportions were regulated in a document passed by the government in the following year. The  |Flag_of_the_United_States|Flag_Of_The_United_States|  is not defined in the constitution but rather in a separate Flag Resolution passed in 1777.     Minor design changes of national flags are often passed on a legislative or executive level, while substantial changes have constitutional character. The design of the  |flag_of_Serbia|Flag_Of_Serbia|  omitting the communist star of the  |flag_of_Yugoslavia|Flag_Of_Yugoslavia|  was a decision made in the  |1992_Serbian_constitutional_referendum|Serbian_Constitutional_Referendum,_1992| , but the adoption of a coat of arms within the flag was based on a government recommendation in 2003, adopted legislatively in 2009 and again subject to a minor design change in 2010. The Flag of the United States underwent numerous changes because the number of stars represents the number of states, proactively defined in a  |Flag_Act|Flag_Acts|  of 1818 to the effect that on the admission of every new state into the Union, one star be added to the union of the flag ; it was changed for the last time in 1960 with the accession of  |Hawaii|Hawaii| .     A change in national flag is often due to a change of regime, especially following a  |civil_war|Civil_War|  or  |revolution|Revolution| . In such cases, the military origins of the national flag and its connection to political ideology  remains visible. In such cases national flags acquire the status of a  |political_symbol|Political_Symbolism| .     The  |flag_of_Germany|Flag_Of_Germany| , for instance, was a tricolour of black-white-red under the  |German_Empire|German_Empire| , inherited from the  |North_German_Confederation|North_German_Confederation|  . The  |Weimar_Republic|Weimar_Republic|  that followed adopted a black-red-gold tricolour.  |Nazi_Germany|Nazi_Germany|  went back to black-white-red in 1933, and black-red-gold was reinstituted by the two successor states,  |West_Germany|West_Germany|  and  |East_Germany|East_Germany| , with East Germanys flag being  |defaced|Defacement|  with Communist symbols, following  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Similarly the  |flag_of_Libya|Flag_Of_Libya|  introduced with the creation of the  |Kingdom_of_Libya|Kingdom_Of_Libya|  in 1951 was abandoned in 1969 with the  |coup_détat|Coup_Détat|  led by  |Muammar_Gaddafi|Muammar_Gaddafi| . It was used again by  |National_Transitional_Council|National_Transitional_Council|  and by  |anti-Gaddafi_forces|Anti-Gaddafi_Forces|  during the  |Libyan_Civil_War|2011_Libyan_Civil_War|  in 2011 and officially adopted by the  |Libyan_interim_Constitutional_Declaration|Libyan_Interim_Constitutional_Declaration| .       There are three distinct types of national flag for use on land, and three for use at sea, though many countries use identical designs for several of these types of flag.       On land, there is a distinction between  |civil_flags|Civil_Flag|  ,  |state_flags|State_Flag|  , and  |war_or_military_flags|War_Flag|  . Civil flags may be flown by anyone regardless of whether they are linked to government, whereas state flags are those used officially by government agencies. War flags  are used by military organizations such as Armies, Marine Corps, or Air Forces.     In practice, many countries  have identical flags for these three purposes; national flag is sometimes used as a vexillological term to refer to such a three-purpose flag . In a number of countries, however, and notably those in  |Latin_America|Latin_America| , there is a distinct difference between civil and state flags. In most cases, the civil flag is a simplified version of the state flag, with the difference often being the presence of a coat of arms on the state flag that is absent from the civil flag.     Very few countries use a war flag that differs from the state flag. The  |Peoples_Republic_of_China|Flag_Of_The_Peoples_Republic_Of_China| , the  |Republic_of_China|Flag_Of_The_Republic_Of_China| , and  |Japan|Flag_Of_Japan|  are notable examples of this.  |Swallow-tailed_flags|Swallowtail|  are used as war flags and naval ensigns in  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries|  and charged versions as presidential or royal standards. The  |Philippines|Philippines|  does not have a distinctive war flag in this usual sense, but the  |flag_of_the_Philippines|Flag_Of_The_Philippines|  is legally unique in that it is flown with the red stripe on top when the country is in a state of war, rather than the conventional blue.     Flag of Austria.svg  |Civil_flag|Civil_Flag|  of  |Austria|Austria|    Flag of Austria .svg  |State_flag|State_Flag|  of  |Austria|Austria|    Peoples Liberation Army Flag of the Peoples Republic of China.svg  |Flag_of_the_Peoples_Liberation_Army_of_the_Peoples_Republic_of_China|List_Of_Chinese_Flagsmilitary_Flags|           The flag that indicates nationality on a ship is called an  |ensign|Ensign| . As with the national flags, there are three varieties: the  civil ensign  , flown by private vessels; state ensigns , flown by government ships; and  war ensign s , flown by naval vessels. The ensign is flown from an  |ensign|Ensign| -staff at the  |stern|Stern|  of the ship, or from a gaff when underway. Both these positions are superior to any other on the ship, even though the  |masthead|Mast|  is higher. In the absence of a gaff the ensign may be flown from the  |yardarm|Yardarm| .  National flags may also be flown by aircraft and the land vehicles of important officials. In the case of aircraft, those flags are usually painted on, and those are usually to be painted on in the position as if they were blowing in the wind.     In some countries, such as the  |United_States|United_States|  and  |Canada|Canada|  , the national ensign is identical to the national flag, while in others, such as the  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  and  |Japan|Japan| , there are specific ensigns for maritime use. Most countries do not have a separate state ensign, although the United Kingdom is a rare exception, in having a  |red_ensign|Red_Ensign|  for civil use, a  |white_ensign|White_Ensign|  as its naval ensign, and a  |blue_ensign|Blue_Ensign|  for government non-military vessels.                There is a great deal of protocol involved in the proper display of national flags. A general rule is that the national flag should be flown in the position of honour, and not in an inferior position to any other flag . The following rules are typical of the conventions when flags are flown on land:   When a national flag is displayed together with any other flags, it must be hoisted first and lowered last.   When a national flag is displayed together with the national flags of other countries, all the flags should be of approximately equal size and must be flown at an equal height, although the national flag of the host country should be flown in the position of honour .   When a national flag is displayed together with flags other than national flags, it should be flown on a separate flagpole, either higher or in the position of honour.   When a national flag is displayed together with any other flags on the same flagpole, it must be at the top, though separate flagpoles are preferable.   When a national flag is displayed together with any other flag on crossed flagpoles, the national flag must be on the observers left and its flagpole must be in front of the flagpole of the other flag.   When a national flag is displayed together with another flag or flags in procession, the national flag must be on the marching right. If there is a row of flags, it should be in the position of honour.   When a national flag, with some exceptions, is flown upside down it indicates distress. This however is merely tradition. It is not a recognised distress signal according to the  |International_regulations_for_preventing_collisions_at_sea|International_Regulations_For_Preventing_Collisions_At_Sea| . Further, a nations flag is commonly flown inverted as a sign of protest or contempt against the country concerned. As of now, only the  |flag_of_the_Philippines|Flag_Of_The_Philippines|  recognises the distress symbolism of the reverse flag.       Most flags are hung vertically by rotating the flag pole. However, some countries have specific protocols for this purpose or even have special flags for vertical hanging; usually rotating some elements of the flag — such as the coat of arms — so that they are seen in an upright position. .     Examples of countries that have special protocol for vertical hanging are:  |Canada|Flag_Of_Canada| ,  |Czech_Republic|Flag_Of_Czech_Republic| ,  |Greece|Flag_Of_Greece| ,  |Israel|Flag_Of_Israel| , the  |Philippines|Flag_Of_The_Philippines| ,  |Saudi_Arabia|Flag_Of_Saudi_Arabia| ,  |South_Africa|Flag_Of_South_Africa| , and the  |United_States|Flag_Of_The_United_States|  ; and the  |United_Kingdom|Flag_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  .     Examples of countries that have special designs for vertical hanging are:  |Austria|Flag_Of_Austria| ,  |Germany|Flag_Of_Germany| ,  |Hungary|Flag_Of_Hungary| ,  |Mexico|Flag_Of_Mexico| ,  |Montenegro|Flag_Of_Montenegro| ,  |Poland|Flag_Of_Poland| , and  |Slovakia|Flag_Of_Slovakia|  ;  |Cambodia|Flag_Of_Cambodia|  ;  |Dominica|Flag_Of_Dominica|  ;  |Liechtenstein|Flag_Of_Liechtenstein| |flag_of_the_United_States|Flag_Of_The_United_States| |flag_of_Slovakia|Flag_Of_Slovakia| |flag_of_Cambodia|Flag_Of_Cambodia| |flag_of_Dominica|Flag_Of_Dominica| |flag_of_Liechtenstein|Flag_Of_Liechtenstein| .             The art and practice of designing flags is known as  |vexillography|Vexillography| . The design of national flags has seen a number of customs become apparent.     All national flags are rectangular, except for the  |flag_of_Nepal|Flag_Of_Nepal| . The  |ratios_of_height_to_width|List_Of_Countries_By_Proportions_Of_National_Flags|  vary among national flags, but none is taller than it is wide, again except for the flag of Nepal. The flags of  |Switzerland|Flag_Of_Switzerland|  and the  |Vatican_City|Flag_Of_The_Vatican_City|  are the only national flags which are exact squares.     The obverse and reverse of all national flags are either identical or mirrored, except for the  |flag_of_Paraguay|Flag_Of_Paraguay|  and the partially recognized  |Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic|Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic| . See  |Flags_whose_reverse_differs_from_the_obverse|Flags_Whose_Reverse_Differs_From_The_Obverse|  for a list of exceptions including non-national flags.     As of 2011 all national flags consist of at least two different colours. In many cases, the different colours are presented in either horizontal or vertical bands. It is particularly common for colours to be presented in  |bands_of_three|Triband| .     It is common for many flags to feature national symbols, such as  |coats_of_arms|Coat_Of_Arms| . National patterns are present in some flags. Variations in design within a national flag can be common in the flags upper left quarter, or canton.                 The most popular colours in national flags are red, white, green, dark blue, yellow, light blue, and black.  The occurrence of each colour in all the flags is listed in detail in the table below. The table shows that the colours light brown, dark brown and grey only occur in very small quantities. In fact, they only occur in the symbols of flags, such as in the Spanish flag.                        Although the national flag is meant to be a unique symbol for a country, many pairs of countries have highly similar flags. Examples include the flags of  |Monaco|Flag_Of_Monaco|  and  |Indonesia|Flag_Of_Indonesia| , which differ only slightly in proportion; the flags of the  |Netherlands|Flag_Of_The_Netherlands|  and  |Luxembourg|Flag_Of_Luxembourg| , which differ in proportion as well as in the tint of blue used; and the flags of  |Romania|Flag_Of_Romania|  and  |Chad|Flag_Of_Chad| , which differ only in the tint of blue.     The flags of  |Ireland|Flag_Of_Ireland|  and  |Côte_dIvoire|Flag_Of_Côte_Divoire|  and the flags of  |Mali|Flag_Of_Mali|  and  |Guinea|Flag_Of_Guinea|  are vertically mirrored versions from each other. This means that the reverse of one flag matches the obverse of the other. Other than horizontal mirrored flags  the direction in which these flags fly are crucial to identify them.     There are three colour combinations that are used on several flags in certain regions. Blue, white, and red is a  |common_combination|Pan-Slavic_Colours|  in  |Slavic_countries|Slavic_Europe|  such as the  |Czech_Republic|Flag_Of_The_Czech_Republic| ,  |Slovakia|Flag_Of_Slovakia| ,  |Russia|Flag_Of_Russia| ,  |Serbia|Flag_Of_Serbia| ,  |Slovenia|Flag_Of_Slovenia| , and  |Croatia|Flag_Of_Croatia|  as well as among Western nations including  |Australia|Flag_Of_Australia| ,  |France|Flag_Of_France| ,  |Iceland|Flag_Of_Iceland| ,  |Norway|Flag_Of_Norway| ,  |New_Zealand|Flag_Of_New_Zealand| , the  |United_Kingdom|Flag_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , the  |Netherlands|Flag_Of_The_Netherlands|  and the  |United_States_of_America|Flag_Of_The_United_States| . Many African nations use the  |Pan-African_colours|Pan-African_Colours|  of red, yellow, and green, including  |Ghana|Flag_Of_Ghana| ,  |Cameroon|Flag_Of_Cameroon| ,  |Mali|Flag_Of_Mali|  and  |Senegal|Flag_Of_Senegal| . Flags containing red, white, and black  can be found particularly among the Arab nations such as  |Egypt|Flag_Of_Egypt| ,  |Iraq|Flag_Of_Iraq| ,  |Syria|Flag_Of_Syria|  and  |Yemen|Flag_Of_Yemen| .     While some similarities are coincidental, others are rooted in shared histories. For example, the flags of  |Colombia|Flag_Of_Colombia| , of  |Ecuador|Flag_Of_Ecuador| , and of  |Venezuela|Flag_Of_Venezuela|  all use variants of the  |flag_of_Gran_Colombia|Flag_Of_Gran_Colombia| , the country they composed upon their independence from  |Spain|Spain| , created by the Venezuelan independence hero  |Francisco_de_Miranda|Francisco_De_Miranda| ; and the flags of  |Kuwait|Flag_Of_Kuwait| , of  |Jordan|Flag_Of_Jordan| , and of  |Palestine|Flag_Of_Palestine|  are all highly similar variants of the  |flag_of_the_Arab_revolt|Pan-Arab_Colors|  of 1916–1918. The flags of  |Romania|Flag_Of_Romania|  and  |Moldova|Flag_Of_Moldova|  are virtually the same, because of the common history and heritage. Moldova adopted the Romanian flag during the declaration of independence from the USSR in 1991 and later the Moldovan coat of arms was placed in the centre of the flag. All  |Nordic_countries|Nordic_Countries| , with the exception of  |Greenland|Flag_Of_Greenland| , use the  |Nordic_Cross_design|Nordic_Cross_Flag|  , a horizontal cross shifted to the left on a single-coloured background. The  |United_States|United_States|  and  |United_Kingdom|United_Kingdom|  both have red, white, and blue. This similarity is due to the fact that the first 13 states of the U.S. were formerly colonies of the United Kingdom. Also, Australia and  |New_Zealand|New_Zealand|  have very similar flags, which stems from their joint British heritage. Both of these flags feature the  |Union_Jack|Union_Jack|  in one corner, both have royal blue background, and both have the  |Southern_Cross|Southern_Cross|  as a prominent feature. The only differences between these flags is that the  |Australian_flag|Australian_Flag|  has the  |Commonwealth_Star|Commonwealth_Star|  below the canton, and that on the New Zealand flag, just four stars in the Southern Cross are presented, and they are five-pointed red stars with white borders. On the other hand, all five stars of the Southern Cross are presented on the Australian flag, and they are white with seven points, except for the additional smaller fifth star in the Southern Cross which has only five points on this flag. Some similarities to the  |United_States|United_States|  flag with the red and white stripes are noted as well such as the  |flag_of_Malaysia|Flag_Of_Malaysia|  and the  |flag_of_Liberia|Flag_Of_Liberia| , the latter of which was an American resettlement colony.     Many other similarities may be found among current national flags, particularly if inversions of colour schemes are considered, e.g., compare the  |flag_of_Senegal|Flag_Of_Senegal|  to that of  |Cameroon|Flag_Of_Cameroon|  and  |Indonesia|Flag_Of_Indonesia|  to  |Poland|Flag_Of_Poland|  and  |Monaco|Flag_Of_Monaco| . Also the  |Flag_of_Italy|Flag_Of_Italy|  and the  |Flag_of_Hungary|Flag_Of_Hungary|.
