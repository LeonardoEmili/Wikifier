        Amicable numbers are two different  |numbers|Number|  so related that the  |sum|Addition|  of the  |proper_divisors|Proper_Divisor|  of each is equal to the other number. A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an  |aliquot_sequence|Aliquot_Sequence|  of  |period|Periodic_Sequence|  2. A related concept is that of a  |perfect_number|Perfect_Number| , which is a number that equals the sum of its own proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. Numbers that are members of an aliquot sequence with period greater than 2 are known as  |sociable_numbers|Sociable_Number| .     The smallest pair of amicable numbers is . They are amicable because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.     The first ten amicable pairs are: , , , , , , , , , and . .        Amicable numbers were known to the  |Pythagoreans|Pythagoreanism| , who credited them with many mystical properties. A general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by the  |Iraqi|Iraqi_People|  mathematician  |Thābit_ibn_Qurra|Thābit_Ibn_Qurra|  . Other  |Arab|Arab|  mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are  |al-Majriti|Maslamah_Ibn_Ahmad_Al-Majriti|  ,  |al-Baghdadi|Ibn_Tahir_Al-Baghdadi|  , and  |al-Fārisī|Kamāl_Al-Dīn_Al-Fārisī|  . The  |Iran|Iran| ian mathematician  |Muhammad_Baqir_Yazdi|Muhammad_Baqir_Yazdi|  discovered the pair , though this has often been attributed to  |Descartes|René_Descartes| .    Much of the work of  |Eastern_mathematicians|Mathematics_In_Medieval_Islam|  in this area has been forgotten.     Thābit ibn Qurras formula was rediscovered by  |Fermat|Pierre_De_Fermat|  and  |Descartes|René_Descartes|  , to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by  |Euler|Leonhard_Euler|  . It was extended further by  |Borho|Walter_Borho|  in 1972. Fermat and Descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to Arab mathematicians. Euler also discovered dozens of new pairs. The second smallest pair, , was discovered in 1866 by a then teenage B. Nicolò I. Paganini , having been overlooked by earlier mathematicians.      By 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then. Exhaustive searches have been carried out to find all pairs less than a given bound, this bound being extended from 10 8 in 1970, to 10 10 in 1986, 10 11 in 1993, 10 17 in 2015, and to 10 18 in 2016.     , there are over 1,223,633,201 known amicable pairs. Sergei Chernykh        While these rules do generate some pairs of amicable numbers, many other pairs are known, so these rules are by no means comprehensive.     In particular, the two rules below produce only even amicable pairs, so they are of no interest for the open problem of finding amicable pairs coprime to 210 2·3·5·7, while over 1000 pairs coprime to 30 2·3·5 are known     The Thābit ibn Qurra theorem is a method for discovering amicable numbers invented in the ninth century by the  |Arab|Arab| |mathematician|Mathematician| |Thābit_ibn_Qurra|Thābit_Ibn_Qurra| .      It states that if   :,   :,   :,   where  ref name Rashed  /ref  .
