          A barge is a  |shoal_draft|Draft|  flat-bottomed  |boat|Boat| , built mainly for  |river|River|  and  |canal|Canal|  transport of bulk goods. Originally barges were towed by draft horses on an adjacent  |towpath|Towpath| . Today, barges may be self-propelled, usually with a slow-revving diesel engine and a large-diameter fixed-pitch  |propeller|Propeller| . Otherwise, dumb barges must be towed by  |tugs|Tug| , or pushed by  |pusher_boats|Pusher| . Compared to a towed barge, a pusher system has improved handling and is more efficient, as the pushing tug becomes part of the unit and it contributes to the momentum of the whole.       In Great Britain, during the  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , a substantial network of narrow canals was developed from 1750 onwards; but from 1825 competition from the  |railways|Railway|  eventually  |took_over_from_canal_traffic|History_Of_The_British_Canal_System|  due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of  |rail_transport|Rail_Transport| . Barges carrying bulk and heavy cargoes continue to be viable. Originally, British canals had locks only  wide, so  |narrowboats|Narrowboats|  could be no more than 610 wide if they were to be able to navigate the system. It was soon realised that narrow locks were too limiting, and later locks were doubled in width to . Accordingly, on the  |British_canal_system|Canals_Of_Great_Britain| , the term barge is used to describe a boat wider than a  |narrowboat|Narrowboat|  , and the people who move barges are often known as  |lightermen|Lightermen| . On the UK canal system, boats wider than  are often referred to as widebeam. In the United States, deckhands perform the labor and are supervised by a leadman or the mate. The captain and pilot steer the towboat, which pushes one or more barges held together with rigging, collectively called the tow. The crew live aboard the towboat as it travels along the inland river system or the intracoastal waterways. These towboats travel between ports and are also called line-haul boats.      Poles are used on barges to fend off the barge as it nears other vessels or a wharf. These are often called pike poles.          |Articulated_tug_and_barge|Articulated_Tug_And_Barge| |_Barracks_barge|Barracks_Barge|    Bin barge    |Canal_motorship|Day_Peckinpaugh| |_Car_float|Car_Float| |_Concrete_Barge|Typebshipconcretebarge| |_Crane_barge|Crane_Barge| |_Dredges|Dredges| |_Dutch_barge|Dutch_Barge| |_Dry_bulk_cargo_barge|Dry_Bulk_Cargo_Barge| |_Hopper_barge|Hopper_Barge| |_Hotel_barge|Hotel_Barge| |_Horse_drawn_boat|Horse_Drawn_Boat| |_Jackup_barge|Jackup_Barge| |_Landing_barge|Landing_Craft| |_Lighter|Lighter|  and Dumb steel lighter    |Liquid_cargo_barge|Liquid_Cargo_Barge| |_Narrowboat|Narrowboat| |_Norfolk_wherry|Norfolk_Wherry| |_Rocket_landing_barge|Autonomous_Spaceport_Drone_Ship| |_Paddle_barge|Paddle_Barge| |_Péniche|Péniche|  or Spitz barge    |Pleasure_barge|Pleasure_Barge| |_Power_barge|Power_Barge| |_Royal_barge|Royal_Barge| |_trow|Trow| |_Tank_barge|Tank_Barge| |_Thames_sailing_barge|Thames_Sailing_Barge| |_Tom_Pudding|Tom_Pudding| |_Tub_boat|Tub_Boat| |_Whaleback_barge|Whaleback_Barge|            Barges are used today for low-value bulk items, as the cost of hauling goods by barge is very low. Barges are also used for very heavy or bulky items; a typical American barge measures , and can carry up to about  of cargo. The most common European barge measures  and can carry up to about .     As an example, on June 26, 2006, a   |catalytic_cracking|Cracking|  unit reactor was shipped by barge from the  |Tulsa_Port_of_Catoosa|Tulsa_Port_Of_Catoosa|  in  |Oklahoma|Oklahoma|  to a refinery in  |Pascagoula_Mississippi|Pascagoula_Mississippi| . Extremely large objects are normally shipped in sections and assembled onsite, but shipping an assembled unit reduced costs and avoided reliance on construction labor at the delivery site . Of the reactors  journey, only about  were traveled overland, from the final port to the refinery.     Self-propelled barges may be used as such when traveling downstream or upstream in placid waters; they are operated as an unpowered barge, with the assistance of a tugboat, when traveling upstream in faster waters. Canal barges are usually made for the particular canal in which they will operate.     Many barges, primarily  |Dutch_barges|Dutch_Barge| , which were originally designed for carrying cargo along the canals of Europe, are no longer large enough to compete in this industry with larger newer vessels. Many of these barges have been renovated and are now used as luxury  |hotel_barges|Hotel_Barge|  carrying holidaymakers along the same canals on which they once carried grain or coal.          In primitive regions today and in all pre-development regions worldwide in times before industrial development and highways, barges were the predominant and most efficient means of inland transportation in many regions. This holds true today, for many areas of the world.     In such pre-industrialized, or poorly developed infrastructure regions, many barges are purpose-designed to be powered on waterways by long slender poles – thereby becoming known on American waterways as poleboats as the extensive west of North America was settled using the vast tributary river systems of the  |Mississippi|Mississippi_River| |_drainage_basin|Drainage_Basin| . Poleboats use muscle power of walkers along the sides of the craft pushing a pole against the streambed, canal or lake bottom to move the vessel where desired. In settling the American west it was generally faster to navigate downriver from  |Brownsville_Pennsylvania|Brownsville_Pennsylvania| , to the  |Ohio_River|Ohio_River|  confluence with the  |Mississippi|Mississippi_River|  and then pole upriver against the current to St. Louis than to travel overland on the rare primitive dirt roads for many decades after the  |American_Revolution|American_Revolution| .     Once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads reached Chicago, that time dynamic changed, and American poleboats became less common, relegated to smaller rivers and more remote streams. On the Mississippi riverine system today, including that of other sheltered waterways, industrial barge trafficking in bulk raw materials such as coal, coke, timber, iron ore and other minerals is extremely common; in the developed world using huge cargo barges that connect in groups and trains-of-barges in ways that allow cargo volumes and weights considerably greater than those used by pioneers of modern barge systems and methods in the  |Victorian_era|Victorian_Era| .        Such barges need to be towed by  |tugboats|Tugboat|  or pushed by  |towboats|Towboat| . Canal barges, towed by draft animals on a waterway adjacent  |towpath|Towpath|  were of fundamental importance in the early  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution| , whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build  |viaducts|Viaduct| ,  |aqueducts|Navigable_Aqueduct|  and especially canals to fuel and feed raw materials to nascent factories in the early industrial takeoff and take their goods to ports and cities for distribution.     The barge and canal system contended favourably with the  |railways|Railway|  in the early  |Industrial_Revolution|Industrial_Revolution|  before around the 1850s  1860s; for example, the  |Erie_Canal|Erie_Canal|  in  |New_York|New_York|  state is credited by economic historians with giving the growth boost needed for  |New_York_City|New_York_City|  to eclipse  |Philadelphia|Philadelphia|  as Americas largest port and city – but such canal systems with their locks, need for maintenance and dredging, pumps and sanitary issues  |were_eventually_outcompeted|History_Of_The_British_Canal_System|  in the carriage of high-value items by the railways due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of  |rail_transport|Rail_Transport| . Barge and canal systems were nonetheless of great, perhaps even primary, economic importance until after the  |First_World_War|World_War_I|  in Europe, particularly in the more developed nations of the  |Low_Countries|Low_Countries| ,  |France|France| ,  |Germany|Germany|  and especially  |Great_Britain|Uk| |_River_Danube|River_Danube| |_Toulouse|Toulouse|  Andromeda in canal at  |Hanover|Hanover| |_River_Moselle|River_Moselle| |_IJmuiden|Ijmuiden| |_Space_Shuttle|Space_Shuttle|  external tank for STS-119 under tow to  |Port_Canaveral|Port_Canaveral| ,  |Florida|Florida| |_Grand_Canal_of_China|Grand_Canal_Of_China|  near  |Yangzhou|Yangzhou| ,  |Jiangsu|Jiangsu| |_Heinz_Field|Heinz_Field|  in  |Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania|  on the  |Ohio_River|Ohio_River|  Suphannahong docked at  |Wat_Arun|Wat_Arun| |_pier|Pier| , one of the  |Thai|Thailand|  royal barges featured in the  |royal_barge_ceremony|Royal_Barge_Procession|    Image:Donna York.jpg  |Towboat|Towboat|  Donna York pushing barges of coal up the Ohio River at  |Louisville|Louisville_Kentucky| ,  |Kentucky|Kentucky|   Barge Haulers on the Volga  , by  |Ilya_Repin|Ilya_Repin|  Tongkang  |Slipway|Slipway|  at  |Portland_Harbour|Portland_Harbour| ,  |Dorset|Dorset| ,  |England|England| , holding a  |split_dump_barge|Hopper_Barge| |_Mosel|Moselle|  in  |Germany|Germany| |_Type_B_ship|Type_B_Ship| |_Ferrocement|Ferrocement| |_National_Waterways_Museum|National_Waterways_Museum| .
