Differential equation s arise in many problems in  |physics|Physics| ,  |engineering|Engineering| , and other sciences. The following examples show how to solve differential equations in a few simple cases when an exact solution exists.          Equations in the form   fg are called separable and solved by   fdx and thus       fdx . Prior to dividing by g , one needs to check if there are stationary   solutions yconst satisfying g0 .          A separable linear  |ordinary_differential_equation|Ordinary_Differential_Equation|  of the first order   must be homogeneous and has the general form     :   + f y 0     where f is some known  |function|Function| . We may solve this by  |separation_of_variables|Separation_Of_Variables|  ,     :   -f  dt     Since the separation of variables in this case involves dividing by y, we must check if the constant function y0 is a solution of the original equation. Trivially, if y0 then y0, so y0 is actually a solution of the original equation. We note that y0 is not allowed in the transformed equation.     We solve the transformed equation with the variables already separated by  |Integrating|Integral_Calculus| ,     :    y    + C     where C is an arbitrary constant. Then, by  |exponentiation|Exponentiation| , we obtain     : y   e   e e .     Here, e /math math /math  math /math  math /math  math /math math /math math  /math  math /math math /math math c-2a and ka2+b2 .     The equation can be also solved in MATLAB symbolic toolbox as     x dsolve     although the solution looks rather ugly,     x / -   /       This is a model of a  |damped_oscillator|Damping| . The plot of displacement against time would look like this:     :      which resembles how one would expect a vibrating spring to behave as friction removes energy from the system.         The following example of a first order linear systems of ODEs   : y1y1+2y2+t   : y22y1-2y2+      can be easily solved symbolically using  |numerical_analysis_software|Listofnumericalanalysissoftware| .
