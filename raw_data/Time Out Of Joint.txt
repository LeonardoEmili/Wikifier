     Time Out of Joint is a  |dystopian_novel|Dystopian_Novel|  by American writer  |Philip_K._Dick|Philip_K._Dick| , first published in novel form in the United States in 1959. An  |abridged|Abridgement|  version was also serialised in the British  |science_fiction_magazine|Science_Fiction_Magazine|   New Worlds Science Fiction  in several installments from December 1959 to February 1960.     The novel epitomizes many of Dicks themes with its concerns about the nature of reality and ordinary people in ordinary lives having the world unravel around them. The title is a reference to  |Shakespeares|William_Shakespeare|  play  Hamlet . The line is uttered by Hamlet to Horatio after being visited by his fathers ghost and learning that his uncle Claudius murdered his father; in short, a shocking supernatural event that fundamentally alters the way Hamlet perceives the state and the universe , much as do several events in the novel.            Ragle Gumm lives in the year 1959 in a quiet American suburb. His unusual profession consists of repeatedly winning the cash prize in a local newspaper contest called Where Will The Little Green Man Be Next? . Gumms 1959 has some differences from ours: the  |Tucker|1948_Tucker_Sedan|  car is in production, AM/FM  |radios|Radio|  are scarce to non-existent, and  |Marilyn_Monroe|Marilyn_Monroe|  is a complete unknown. As the novel opens, strange things begin to happen to Gumm. A  |soft-drink|Soft-Drink|  stand disappears, replaced by a small slip of paper with the words SOFT-DRINK STAND printed on it in  |block_letters|Block_Letters| . Intriguing little pieces of the real 1959 turn up: a magazine article on Marilyn Monroe, a  |telephone_book|Telephone_Book|  with non-operational  |exchanges|Telephone_Exchange|  listed and radios hidden away in someone elses house. People with no apparent connection to Gumm, including military pilots using aircraft  |transceivers|Transceiver| , refer to him by name. Few other characters notice these or experience similar anomalies; the sole exception is Gumms supposed  |brother-in-law|Brother-In-Law| , Victor Vic Nielson, in whom he confides. A neighborhood woman, Mrs. Keitelbein, invites him to a  |civil_defense|Civil_Defense|  class where he sees a model of a futuristic underground military factory. He has the unshakeable feeling hes been inside that building many times before.     Confusion gradually mounts for Gumm. His neighbor Bill Black knows far more about these events than he admits, and, observing this, begins worrying: Suppose Ragle is becoming sane again? In fact, Gumm does become sane, and the deception surrounding him begins to unravel.     Gumm tries to escape the town and is turned back by  |Kafkaesque|Kafkaesque|  obstructions. He sees a magazine with himself on the cover, in a  |military_uniform|Military_Uniform| , at the factory depicted in the model. He tries a second time to escape, this time with Vic, and succeeds. He learns that his idyllic town is a  |constructed_reality|Constructed_Reality|  designed to protect him from the frightening fact that he lives on a then-future Earth that is at war against  |lunar_colonists|Colonization_Of_The_Moon|  who are fighting for a permanent lunar settlement, politically independent from Earth.     Gumm has a unique ability to predict where the colonists  |nuclear_strikes|Nuclear_Warfare|  will be aimed. Previously Gumm did this work for the military, but then he  |defected|Defection|  to the colonists side and planned to secretly emigrate to the Moon. But before this could happen, he began retreating into a fantasy world based largely upon the relatively idyllic surroundings of his extreme youth. He was no longer able to shoulder his responsibility as Earths lone protector from Lunar-launched nuclear offensives. The fake town was thereby created within Gumms mind to accommodate and rationalize his  |dementia|Dementia|  so that he could continue predicting nuclear strikes in the guise of submitting entries to a harmless newspaper contest and without the ethical qualms involved with being on the wrong side of a  |civil_war|Civil_War| . While Gumm regressed by himself to a 1950s mindset, the rest of the town with a few exceptions like Black were all put in a similar state artificially, explaining why hardly anyone else could perceive anomalies.     When Gumm finally remembers his true personal history, he decides to emigrate to the Moon after all because he feels that exploration and migration, as basic  |human_impulses|Impulse| , should never be denied to people by any national or planetary government. Vic rejects this belief, referring to the colonists essentially as aggressors and terrorists, and returns to the simulated town- which has lost its  raison detre .
