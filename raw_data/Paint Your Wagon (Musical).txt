Isherwood, Charles.  The New York Times, March 20, 2015       In 2010, Steven Suskin wrote, The interwoven use of ballet that worked so well in the highlands was less effective on the prairies, and the subject matter was harsh and cold. In spite of the shows failure, Loewe displayed ... an uncanny ability to write scores indigenous to the time and locale of the characters and plots. Suskin, Steven.
