   Gadolinium is a  |chemical_element|Chemical_Element|  with the  |symbol|Symbol|  Gd and  |atomic_number|Atomic_Number|  64. Gadolinium is a silvery-white metal when oxidation is removed. It is only slightly  |malleable|Malleable|  and is a  |ductile|Ductile| |rare-earth_element|Rare-Earth_Element| . Gadolinium reacts with atmospheric  |oxygen|Oxygen|  or moisture slowly to form a black coating. Gadolinium below its  |Curie_point|Curie_Point|  of  is  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetic| , with an attraction to a magnetic field higher than that of  |nickel|Nickel| . Above this temperature it is the most  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism|  element. It is found in nature only in an oxidized form. When separated, it usually has impurities of the other rare-earths because of their similar chemical properties.     Gadolinium was discovered in 1880 by  |Jean_Charles_de_Marignac|Jean_Charles_Galissard_De_Marignac| , who detected its oxide by using spectroscopy. It is named after the mineral  |gadolinite|Gadolinite| , one of the minerals in which gadolinium is found, itself named for the chemist  |Johan_Gadolin|Johan_Gadolin| . Pure gadolinium was first isolated by the chemist  |Paul_Emile_Lecoq_de_Boisbaudran|Paul_Emile_Lecoq_De_Boisbaudran|  around 1886.     Gadolinium possesses unusual  |metallurgical|Metallurgy|  properties, to the extent that as little as 1% of gadolinium can significantly improve the workability and resistance to  |oxidation|Oxidation|  at high temperatures of  |iron|Iron| ,  |chromium|Chromium| , and related metals. Gadolinium as a metal or a salt absorbs  |neutrons|Neutron|  and is, therefore, used sometimes for shielding in neutron  |radiography|Radiography|  and in  |nuclear_reactors|Nuclear_Reactor| .     Like most of the rare earths, gadolinium forms  |trivalent|Trivalent|  ions with fluorescent properties, and salts of gadolinium are used as phosphors in various applications.     The kinds of gadolinium ions occurring in water-soluble salts are toxic to mammals. However,  |chelated|Chelation|  gadolinium compounds are far less toxic because they carry gadolinium through the  |kidneys|Kidney|  and out of the body before the free ion can be released into the tissues. Because of its  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism|  properties, solutions of chelated  |organic|Organic_Chemistry|  gadolinium  |complexes|Coordination_Complex|  are used as  |intravenous|Intravenous| ly administered  |gadolinium-based_MRI_contrast_agents|Gadolinium-Based_Mri_Contrast_Agent|  in medical  |magnetic_resonance_imaging|Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging| .              Gadolinium is a silvery-white,  |malleable|Malleability| ,  |ductile|Ductility| |rare-earth_element|Rare-Earth_Element| . It crystallizes in the  |hexagonal_close-packed|Hexagonal_Crystal_System|  α-form at room temperature, but, when heated to temperatures above , it transforms into its β-form, which has a  |body-centered_cubic|Body-Centered_Cubic|  structure.     The  |isotope|Isotope|  gadolinium-157 has the highest  |thermal-neutron|Thermal_Neutron| |capture|Neutron_Capture|  cross-section among any stable nuclide: about 259,000  |barns|Barn| . Only  |xenon-135|Xenon-135|  has a higher capture cross-section, about 2.0 million barns, but this isotope is  |radioactive|Radioactive| .      Gadolinium is believed to be  |ferromagnetic|Ferromagnetism|  at temperatures below  and is strongly  |paramagnetic|Paramagnetism|  above this temperature. There is evidence that gadolinium is a helical antiferromagnetic, rather than a ferromagnetic, below .  Gadolinium demonstrates a  |magnetocaloric_effect|Magnetic_Refrigerationthe_Magnetocaloric_Effect|  whereby its temperature increases when it enters a magnetic field and decreases when it leaves the magnetic field. The temperature is lowered to  for the gadolinium  |alloy|Alloy|  Gd 85 Er 15 , and this effect is considerably stronger for the alloy Gd 5 , but at a much lower temperature  .
