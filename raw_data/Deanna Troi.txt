   Commander Deanna Troi  is a main character in the  |science-fiction|Science_Fiction| |television_series|Television_Series|   Star Trek: The Next Generation  and  |related_TV_series_and_films|Star_Trek| , portrayed by actress  |Marina_Sirtis|Marina_Sirtis| . Troi is half-human, half- |Betazoid|Betazoid|  and has the  |psionic|Psionics|  ability to  |sense_emotions|Empathy| . She serves as the ships counselor on  |USS_Enterprise-D|Uss_Enterprise| . Throughout most of the series, she holds the rank of  |lieutenant_commander|Lieutenant_Commander| . In the seventh season, however, Troi takes the bridge officers examination and is promoted to the rank of  |commander|Commander| , but continues as counselor. Deanna and Riker were the last Star Trek: The Next Generation main cast members to appear on television in the 2005 finale of the later  Star Trek: Enterprise  TV show, until  |Patrick_Stewart|Patrick_Stewart|  announced he would return to the role of  |Jean-Luc_Picard|Jean-Luc_Picard|  in 2019 in  Star Trek: Picard . Deanna appears in all four TNG theatrical films, and also in three episodes of  Star Trek: Voyager .     Her romantic interests, family, and personal life are plot elements in many Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes over the course of the series.       Deanna Troi was born on March 29, 2336, near Lake El-Nar,  |Betazed|Betazed| .    Deannas parents are Betazoid Ambassador  |Lwaxana_Troi|Lwaxana_Troi|  , and deceased human Starfleet officer Lt. Ian Andrew Troi . An older sister, Kestra, died in a drowning accident during Deannas infancy. Although Deanna Troi has little exposure to  |Earth|Earth|  culture, she attended  |Starfleet_Academy|Starfleet_Academy|  from 2355 to 2359, as well as the University on Betazed, and earned an advanced degree in  |psychology|Psychology| .     Deanna Troi serves as the ships  |counselor|Psychotherapy|  aboard the Starfleet starships  |USS_Enterprise|Uss_Enterprise|  and  |Enterprise-E|Uss_Enterprise|  under the command of  |Captain|Captain| |Jean-Luc_Picard|Jean-Luc_Picard| . In  Star Trek: Nemesis , Troi leaves the Enterprise with her new husband  |William_Riker|William_Riker| , who has just been promoted to captain of the USS Titan, assuming the newly created position of diplomatic officer . Trois empathic abilities prove key to main shows, and another popular area is her relationships and sexuality. In  |The_Child|The_Child|  , she gives birth to an alien child.     The Betazoid race has  |telepathic|Telepathic|  abilities. Due to her half-human heritage, Troi has only partial telepathic abilities, and as a result, is more of an  |empath|Empathy|  with  |clairsentience|Clairsentience| . In Star Trek: Nemesis, Troi has expanded her empathic abilities, as she is able to connect to another psychic and follow that empathic bond to its source. In this instance, her ability enables Enterprise-E to target and hit the  |Romulan|Romulan|  vessel Scimitar, despite the fact that it is cloaked. She is also able to communicate telepathically with her mother and other telepathic Betazoids or races with sufficient aptitude. Several species are resistant to the telepathy and empathy of Betazoids such as the  |Ferengi|Ferengi| , the  |Breen|Breen| , and the Ulians. The inability of Betazoids to read the Ferengi , the Breen, and the Ulians was established in the episodes  |Ménage_à_Troi|Ménage_À_Troi|  ,  |The_Loss|The_Loss|  , and  |Violations|Violations|  , respectively.     Early in the series, Troi finds herself working with a former lover, the newly assigned  |first_officer|Executive_Officer|  to USS Enterprise,  |Commander|Commander| |William_Riker|William_Riker| . In season one, she meets a potential spouse in  |Haven|Haven|  . In later episodes, Troi has romantic involvements with several others, including a brief relationship with  |Klingon|Klingon|  Starfleet officer  |Lieutenant|Lieutenant| |Worf|Worf| . A major exploration of their relationship begins with  |Parallels|Parallels|  , in which Worf encounters parallel universes where they are married with children. Another episode that explores a Troi-Worf relationship is  |Eye_of_the_Beholder|Eye_Of_The_Beholder|  . However, in both cases, they are not revealed to be dating aboard the real ship, although both episodes are oriented towards exploring this concept. In  |All_Good_Things...|All_Good_Things...|  , the beginnings of real-world relationship are briefly explored, though this is abruptly dropped as Worf explores other love interests in  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine , and Trois romantic relationship with Riker is rekindled through the Next Generation films.     As a main cast member, Troi appears in nearly every TNG episode, though particular episodes, starting with The Child , feature her as the primary protagonist. Her name is included in the show title  |Ménage_à_Troi|Ménage_À_Troi|  , which is oriented towards an adventure her mother and she have . Other episodes principally about Troi include:  |Face_of_the_Enemy|Face_Of_The_Enemy|  ,  |Man_of_the_People|Man_Of_The_People|  ,  |Violations|Violations|  , and  |Night_Terrors|Night_Terrors|  .     She is addressed in various ways by fellow officers. Captain Picard calls her Counselor , but when he is concerned about her, or in emergencies, he calls her Deanna . Picard also refers to her as Commander in the pilot episode,  |Encounter_at_Farpoint|Encounter_At_Farpoint|  , which is consistent with her uniforms rank pips. Riker addresses her as Lieutenant a single time in the pilot episode; her service rank is not referred to again for several seasons.  |Doctor_Crusher|Beverly_Crusher|  usually calls her Troi . Data very rarely calls her by her first name, usually calling her Counselor Troi . Depending on the situation, Commander Riker calls her Deanna or  |Imzadi|Imzadi|  , which means beloved in the Betazoid language.     In several episodes, Troi falls victim to aliens. In an episode of season four , the Enterprise’s crew loses a days memory. As events unfold, Troi is taken over by an entity to communicate with the crew. She temporarily gains superhuman strength and effortlessly tosses Worf across the bridge, breaking his wrist. In the season-five episode, Violations , the Enterprise encounters an alien species who are telepathic and specialize in being able to bring back lost memories. One of the aliens mentally assaults Deanna and also tries to physically assault her in her quarters. She is saved by Worf and one of his security teams. In the film, Star Trek Nemesis, she is mentally violated by Shinzons viceroy, who is also telepathic. This occurs in her quarters when she is with her new husband, Commander Riker; it also occurs in the Star Trek: Nemesis bonus deleted scenes, where she is attacked in the turbolift. She eventually is able to turn the tables on the viceroy using the same connection.     Troi is an avid connoisseur of chocolate, a fact that is significant in multiple episodes, including one in which she tells Commander Riker how to properly enjoy eating it. In the episode  |Remember_Me|Remember_Me|  , Beverly Crusher briefly describes Troi to Captain Picard to jog his memory and mentions that she loves chocolate . She is known for ordering chocolate-flavored desserts in  |Ten-Forward|Ten-Forward| , and her love for desserts is a common point of dialogue in many shows. She talks about this with a visiting-alien ambassador in  |Liaisons|Liaisons|  , who takes up her love for desserts as in their culture they do not have this type of food.     Dream-themed episodes include  |Phantasms|Phantasms|  , where Deanna appears as cake in Datas dream and in Night Terrors , her dreams help save the ship. The dreams a suitor thinks he is having about her in Haven become a major plot point in that episode.       Marina Sirtis at first read for the role that would become  |Tasha_Yar|Tasha_Yar|  in 1986. She had, in total, five readings, all with  |Gene_Roddenberry|Gene_Roddenberry|  and other executives. Notably, Roddenberry took a liking to her almost immediately.

She landed a guest role on the series Hunter. Other small television roles followed, but no steady work came her way during her short stay. Just before she was to return home  – broke, credit cards maxed out , and depressed  – Sirtis auditioned for the role of the chief security officer aboard the USS Enterprise, Lieutenant Macha Hernandez .  |Denise_Crosby|Denise_Crosby| , who eventually won the role of Tasha, auditioned for the role of Deanna Troi.

Meanwhile, Denise Crosby had been auditioning for the role of Lieutenant Commander Deanna Troi, the ships Betazoid counselor. Marina Sirtis was said to have had a more exotic feel about her. As stated in the DVD extras found on a bonus Star Trek TNG DVD     She was just about to return home, in debt and jobless, when she received the phone call alerting her that she had the role of Deanna Troi. She stated that if it had been an hour later, she would have missed that call and been on her way to  |England|England| . Sirtis  |US_visa|Visa_Policy_Of_The_United_States|  was expiring that day, and if she had stayed any longer, she could have run into legal trouble.     For Sirtis, Star Trek was her first big break. Prior to Deanna Troi, her acting career was going nowhere: What they told us about The Next Generation when we first started was that we were guaranteed 26 episodes. So that was the longest job Ive ever had. She knew little about the Star Trek franchise and at first just thought of it as a good means to pay her bills.      Initially, Sirtis/Trois character was planned as a sexually attractive woman on the show. Gene Roddenberry intended her to have four breasts, before his wife told him this was a poor idea.  Prior to filming, Sirtis was told to lose , but thought to herself that she had to drop even more, and was often wearing plunging necklines and form-fitting dresses. After six years, the producers decided to drop the sexy and brainless Troi and make her a stronger character: I was thrilled when I got my regulation Starfleet uniform... it covered up my cleavage and I got all my brains back, because when you have cleavage you cant have brains in Hollywood... I was allowed to do things that I hadnt been allowed to do for five or six years. I went on away teams, I was in charge of staff, I had my pips back, I had phasers, I had all the equipment again, and it was fabulous. I was absolutely thrilled.        One reviewer compared her to  |Doctor_McCoy|Leonard_Mccoy|  from the original Star Trek television series.

The final episode of Enterprise was also Troi and Rikers last appearance, until the announcement that she is also set to return in Star Trek: Picard.
