        An apostolic nuncio  is an  |ecclesiastical|Ecclesiology| |diplomat|Diplomat| , serving as an envoy or a permanent diplomatic representative of the  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  to a  |state|Sovereign_State|  or to an international organization. A nuncio is appointed by and represents the Holy See, and is the head of the  |diplomatic_mission|Diplomatic_Mission| , called an  |Apostolic_Nunciature|Apostolic_Nunciature| , which is the equivalent of an  |embassy|Embassy| . The Holy See is legally distinct from the  |Vatican_City|Vatican_City|  or the  |Catholic_Church|Catholic_Church| . A nuncio is usually an  |archbishop|Archbishoptitular_Archiepiscopal_Sees| .     An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of  |ambassador|Ambassador|  extraordinary and  |plenipotentiary|Plenipotentiary| , although in  |Catholic_countries|Catholic_Countries|  the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Under the 1961  |Vienna_Convention_on_Diplomatic_Relations|Vienna_Convention_On_Diplomatic_Relations| , to which the Holy See is a party, a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country. The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country, and may grant the  |deanship_of_that_countrys_diplomatic_corps|Dean_Of_The_Diplomatic_Corps|  to the nuncio regardless of seniority.  The representative of the Holy See in some situations is called a Delegate or, in the case of the United Nations, Permanent Observer. In the Holy See hierarchy, these usually rank equally to a nuncio, but they do not have formal diplomatic status, though in some countries they have some diplomatic privileges.     In addition, the nuncio serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Church in that particular nation, supervising the diocesan episcopate  and has an important role in the selection of bishops.          The name nuncio is derived from the ancient  |Latin|Ecclesiastical_Latin|  word, nuntius, meaning envoy or messenger . Since such envoys are accredited to the  |Holy_See|Holy_See|  as such and not to the  |State_of_Vatican_City|State_Of_Vatican_City| , the term nuncio emphasizes the unique nature of the diplomatic mission.
