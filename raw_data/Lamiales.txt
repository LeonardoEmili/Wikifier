     The Lamiales are an  |order|Order|  in the  |asterid|Asteridae|  group of  |dicotyledon|Dicotyledon| ous  |flowering_plants|Flowering_Plants| . It includes about 23,810  |species|Species| , 1,059 genera, and is divided into about 24  |families|Family| . Well-known or economically important members of this order include  |lavender|Lavender| ,  |lilac|Lilac| ,  |olive|Olive| ,  |jasmine|Jasmine| , the  |ash_tree|Ash_Tree| ,  |teak|Teak| ,  |snapdragon|Antirrhinum| ,  |sesame|Sesame| ,  |psyllium|Psyllium| ,  |garden_sage|Salvia_Officinalis| , and a number of table herbs such as  |mint|Mentha| ,  |basil|Basil| , and  |rosemary|Rosemary| .       Although exceptions often occur,  |species|Species|  in this order typically have the following characteristics:     superior  |ovary|Ovary|  composed of two fused  |carpels|Carpel|    five  |petals|Petal|  fused into a tube   bilaterally symmetrical, often bilabiate  |corollas|Corolla| |stamens|Stamen|    opposite leaves       The Lamiales previously had a restricted circumscription  that included the major families  |Lamiaceae|Lamiaceae|  ,  |Verbenaceae|Verbenaceae| , and  |Boraginaceae|Boraginaceae| , plus a few smaller families. In the classification system of  |Dahlgren|Rolf_Dahlgren|  the Lamiales were in the  |superorder|Superorder|  Lamiiflorae . Recent phylogenetic work has shown the Lamiales are  |polyphyletic|Polyphyletic|  with respect to order  |Scrophulariales|Scrophulariales|  and the two groups are now usually combined in a single order that also includes the former orders  |Hippuridales|Hippuridales|  and  |Plantaginales|Plantaginales| . Lamiales has become the preferred name for this much larger combined group. The placement of the  |Boraginaceae|Boraginaceae|  is unclear, but phylogenetic work shows this family does not belong in Lamiales.     Also, the circumscription of family  |Scrophulariaceae|Scrophulariaceae| , formerly a  |paraphyletic|Paraphyletic|  group defined primarily by  |plesiomorphic|Plesiomorphic|  characters and from within which numerous other families of the Lamiales were derived, has been radically altered to create a number of smaller, better-defined, and putatively  |monophyletic|Monophyletic|  families.       Much research has been conducted in recent years regarding the dating the Lamiales  |lineage|Lineage| , although there still remains some ambiguity. A 2004 study, on the molecular  |phylogenetic|Phylogenetics|  dating of  |asterid|Asterids|  flowering plants, estimated 106 million years for the stem lineage of Lamiales.  A 2009 study on  |angiosperm|Flowering_Plant|  diversification through time, concluded an inferred age of lower  |Eocene|Eocene| , ca. 50 MY, for Lamiales.
