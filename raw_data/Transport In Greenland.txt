            The  transportation system in Greenland  is very unusual in that Greenland has no  |railways|Railway| , no  |inland_waterways|Inland_Waterway| , and virtually no roads between towns. Historically the major means of transportation has been by boat around the coast in summer and by  |dog_sled|Dog_Sled|  in winter, particularly in the north and east.          While  |Germany|Germany|  occupied  |Denmark|Denmark|  during  |World_War_II|World_War_Nbsp_Ii| , the  |United_States|United_States|  controlled Greenland and built bases and  |airports|Airport| . The airports were codenamed as  |Bluie_West_One|Bluie_West_One|  through to  |Bluie_West_Eight|Bluie_West_Eight|  on the west of the island and  |Bluie|Bluie|  East One to Bluie East Four on the eastern side . The largest of those airports,  |Bluie_West_Eight|Bluie_West_Eight| , now renamed  |Kangerlussuaq_Airport|Kangerlussuaq_Airport| , remains the international hub for travel to Greenland, as it is the only airport that has a long enough runway to service  |jumbo_jets|Wide_Body_Aircraft| . American authorities at one time entertained the idea of building a road from Kangerlussuaq to the second-largest airport, in Narsarsuaq, several hundred kilometres to the south. The idea was abandoned after feasibility studies failed to prove it was possible. These airbases are generally not located near settlements, so travellers need an air transfer by helicopter to reach settlements. All civil aviation matters are handled by the  |Civil_Aviation_Administration_Denmark|Civil_Aviation_Administration_Denmark|  or the  |Greenland_Airport_Authority|Greenland_Airport_Authority| .     Greenland now has 18 airstrips, 14 of which are paved. Some are based on US airbases.     , but most are built by the Greenlandic government. All domestic flights are operated by  |Air_Greenland|Air_Greenland| . The name was  |anglicized|Anglicisation|  in 2002 from the  |Danish|Danish_Language|  Grønlandsfly . International flights are limited to four weekly flights from  |Copenhagen|Copenhagen|  to Kangerlussuaq, and to Reykjavik, Iceland.      |Air_Iceland|Air_Iceland|  flies from  |Reykjavík|Reykjavík|  to Narsarsuaq. It offers also day trips to the wilderness from Reykjavík to  |Kulusuk|Kulusuk|  on the east coast. Air Iceland flies to  |Ittoqqortoormiit|Ittoqqortoormiit|  over  |Kulusuk|Kulusuk|  once or twice a week throughout the year. Flights from Reykjavik are flown throughout the year. Also, year-round flights from Reykjavik to  |Ilulissat|Ilulissat|  will be offered after April 2011. From 2012 Air Greenland operates a route from  |Iqaluit|Iqaluit|  in Canada to Nuuk during summer.     Air cargo is very important for Greenland. Most perishable foodstuff is imported from Denmark by air. It uses the Air Greenland Copenhagen–Kangerlussuaq passenger aircraft, and this is a reason why such a large aircraft is used. The air containers are then transported to the other airports by the small planes that can use the small runways. Some air cargo is transported by boat from Kangerlussuaq, but not in the winter when the  |Kangerlussuaq_Fjord|Kangerlussuaq_Fjord|  freezes .     A state-owned firm called Kalaallit Airports is currently tasked with operating and updating the airports in Nuuk and Ilulissat  . This process has been contentious as Chinese firms bid for the contract, with one Danish PM stating We dont want a communist dictatorship in our backyard,  .       There are no roads between settlements, only within them and around them.   There are 150  km of roads in the whole country; 60  km of the roads are paved. The roads are primary or local roads, there are no highways in Greenland.     Speed limit ranges from  for local roads to  on primary roads.     Some farms in the south have fairly extensive very simple roads for  |all_terrain_vehicles|All_Terrain_Vehicle|  , used for sheep farming and hay collection. There are plans for a  road between  |Sisimiut|Sisimiut|  and  |Kangerlussuaq|Kangerlussuaq| , discussed for several years. In 2015 the cost of it caused it to be replanned as a one-lane road for terrain capable vehicles, costing a tenth as much. It is still not decided .       There are ports at  |Ilulissat|Ilulissat| ,  |Kangerlussuaq|Kangerlussuaq|  ,  |Qaqortoq|Qaqortoq| ,  |Narsaq|Narsaq| ,  |Nuuk|Nuuk|  ,  |Aasiaat|Aasiaat|  and  |Sisimiut|Sisimiut| . Several other towns have also small ports. The only two users of the harbors are  |Royal_Arctic_Line|Royal_Arctic_Line|  and  |Arctic_Umiaq_Line|Arctic_Umiaq_Line| . Royal Arctic Line organises freight ships, for example container ships, with regular sailings from Denmark. Arctic Umiaq Line runs a passenger ship which also carries freight. The distance from Denmark to Nuuk by ship is 3,800 kilometres , so more perishable foodstuff is imported by air.     There are no  |car_ferries|Roll_On_Roll_Off|  in Greenland or to Greenland. It is possible to transport cars as container freight with  |Royal_Arctic_Line|Royal_Arctic_Line|  . Passengers must travel with another method. This is done mostly when moving or buying a car, not normally when travelling, as there is no large road network anywhere.       Historically, special-purpose  |narrow_gauge_railways|Narrow_Gauge| , such as the  gauge  |Qoornoq_X_press|Qoornoq_X_Press|  in the village of  |Qoornoq|Qoornoq|  in the  |Nuuk|Nuuk| |_fjord|Fjord| , have operated. The Qoornoq X-press was used for transporting fish from the harbour to scaffolds for drying.  The railway cars were only flatbed wagon cars with no locomotives to move them.      Built in 1955, the railway was abandoned shortly before the village around 1971.      Besides Qoornoq there are several other railways that existed in Greenland:       |Malmbjerget|Malmbjerget| |_Mestersvig|Mestersvig|  - likely for the local mines that existed in the 1950s and 1960s    |Julianehaab|Julianehaab| |_Ivigtut|Ivigtut|  - likely for the local mine that once operated in the community    |Disko_Island|Disko_Island|  near  |Qutdligssat|Qutdligssat| |_Maamorilik|Maamorilik| .
