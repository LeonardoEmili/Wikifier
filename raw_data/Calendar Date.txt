A calendar date is a reference to a particular day represented within a  |calendar|Calendar|  system. The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified. The number of days between two dates may be calculated. For example, 24   is ten days after 14   in the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar| . The date of a particular event depends on the observed  |time_zone|Time_Zone| . For example, the air  |attack_on_Pearl_Harbor|Attack_On_Pearl_Harbor|  that began at 7:48  a.m.  |Hawaiian_time|Hawaiian_Time|  on 7 December 1941 took place at 3:18  a.m.  |Japan_Standard_Time|Japan_Standard_Time| , 8 December in Japan.     A particular day may be represented by a different date in another calendar as in the  |Gregorian_calendar|Gregorian_Calendar|  and the  |Julian_calendar|Julian_Calendar| , which have been used simultaneously in different places. In most calendar systems, the date consists of three parts: the day of the month, the month, and the year. There may also be additional parts, such as the day of the week. Years are usually counted from a particular starting point, usually called the  |epoch|Epoch| , with  |era|Era|  referring to the particular period of time .     The most widely used epoch is a  |conventional|Convention| |_birthdate_of_Jesus|Historical_Jesusbirth|  . A date without the year may also be referred to as a date or calendar date . As such, it defines the day of an annual event, such as a birthday on 31 May, holiday on 1 September, or Christmas on 25 December.     Many computer systems internally store points in time in  |Unix_time|Unix_Time|  format or some other  |system_time|System_Time|  format.   The  |date_|Date|  command—internally using the  |C_date_and_time_functions|C_Date_And_Time_Functions| —can be used to convert that internal representation of a point in time   to most of the date representations shown here.     The current date in the Gregorian calendar is . If this is not really the current date, then  to update it.                       There is a large variety of formats for dates in use, which differ in the order of date components. These variations use the sample date of 31 May 2006: , component separators , whether leading zeros are included , whether all four digits of the year are written , and whether the month is represented in  |Arabic|Arabic_Numerals|  or  |Roman_numerals|Roman_Numerals|  or by name .          This  |little_endian|Little_Endian|  sequence is used by a majority of the world and is the preferred form by the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  when writing the full date format in official documents. This date format originates from the custom of writing the date as the Nth day of in the year of our Lord in Western religious and legal documents. The format has shortened over time but the order of the elements has remained constant. The following examples use the date of 9 November 2006.      9 November 2006 or 9.
