Hydroxide is a  |diatomic_anion|Polyatomic_Ion|  with  |chemical_formula|Chemical_Formula|  OH − . It consists of an  |oxygen|Oxygen|  and  |hydrogen|Hydrogen| |atom|Atom|  held together by a  |covalent_bond|Covalent_Bond| , and carries a negative  |electric_charge|Electric_Charge| . It is an important but usually  |minor_constituent_of_water|Self-Ionization_Of_Water| . It functions as a  |base|Base| , a  |ligand|Ligand| , a  |nucleophile|Nucleophile| , and a  |catalyst|Catalyst| . The hydroxide ion forms  |salts|Salt| , some of which  |dissociate|Dissociation|  in aqueous solution, liberating solvated hydroxide ions.  |Sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  is a multi-million-ton per annum  |commodity_chemical|Commodity_Chemicals| . A hydroxide attached to a strongly  |electropositive|Electropositive|  center may itself ionize, liberating a  |hydrogen_cation|Hydron|  , making the parent compound an  |acid|Acid| .     The corresponding  |electrically_neutral|Electrically_Neutral|  compound  HO • is the  |hydroxyl_radical|Hydroxyl_Radical|  . The corresponding  |covalently|Covalent_Bond| -bound  |group|Functional_Group|   –OH of atoms is the  |hydroxy_group|Hydroxy_Group| .   Hydroxide ion and hydroxy group are  |nucleophiles|Nucleophile|  and can act as a catalysts in  |organic_chemistry|Organic_Chemistry| .     Many  |inorganic|Inorganic|  substances which bear the word hydroxide in their names are not  |ionic_compounds|Ionic_Compound|  of the hydroxide ion, but covalent compounds which contain  |hydroxy_groups|Hydroxy_Group| .       The hydroxide ion is a natural part of  |water|Water| , because of the  |self-ionization|Self-Ionization_Of_Water|  reaction in which its complement,  |hydronium|Hydronium| , is passed hydrogen:    : |H_3_O_+|Hydronium|  + OH −  2H 2 O   The  |equilibrium_constant|Equilibrium_Constant|  for this reaction, defined as   :K w OH − denotes the concentration of  |hydrogen_cations|Hydron|  and the concentration of hydroxide ions   has a value close to 10 −14 at 25  °C, so the  |concentration|Concentration|  of hydroxide ions in pure water is close to 10 −7  mol∙dm −3 , in order to satisfy the equal charge constraint. The  |pH|Ph|  of a solution is equal to the decimal  |cologarithm|Cologarithm|  of the  |hydrogen_cation|Hydron|  concentration; Strictly speaking pH is the cologarithm of the hydrogen cation  |activity|Activity|  the pH of pure water is close to 7 at ambient temperatures. The concentration of hydroxide ions can be expressed in terms of  |pOH|Phpoh| , which is close to , pOH signifies the minus the logarithm to base 10 of alternatively the logarithm of  so the pOH of pure water is also close to 7. Addition of a base to water will reduce the hydrogen cation concentration and therefore increase the hydroxide ion concentration even if the base does not itself contain hydroxide. For example,  |ammonia|Ammonia|  solutions have a pH greater than 7 due to the reaction NH 3 + H +  , which decreases the hydrogen cation concentration, which increases the hydroxide ion concentration. pOH can be kept at a nearly constant value with various  |buffer_solutions|Buffer_Solution| .          In  |aqueous_solution|Aqueous_Solution|   the hydroxide ion is a  |base|Base|  in the  |Brønsted–Lowry|Brønsted–Lowry_Acid–Base_Theory|  sense as it can accept a proton In this context proton is the term used for a solvated hydrogen cation from a Brønsted–Lowry acid to form a water molecule. It can also act as a  |Lewis_base|Lewis_Base|  by donating a pair of electrons to a Lewis acid. In aqueous solution both hydrogen and hydroxide ions are strongly solvated, with  |hydrogen_bonds|Hydrogen_Bond|  between oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Indeed, the bihydroxide ion  has been characterized in the solid state. This compound is centrosymmetric and has a very short hydrogen bond  that is similar to the length in the  |bifluoride|Bifluoride|  ion  .  In aqueous solution the hydroxide ion forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules. A consequence of this is that concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide have high  |viscosity|Viscosity|  due to the formation of an extended network of hydrogen bonds as in  |hydrogen_fluoride|Hydrogen_Fluoride|  solutions.     In solution, exposed to air, the hydroxide ion reacts rapidly with atmospheric  |carbon_dioxide|Carbon_Dioxide| , acting as an acid, to form, initially, the  |bicarbonate|Bicarbonate|  ion.   :OH − + CO 2     The  |equilibrium_constant|Equilibrium_Constant|  for this reaction can be specified either as a reaction with dissolved carbon dioxide or as a reaction with carbon dioxide gas . At neutral or acid pH, the reaction is slow, but is catalyzed by the  |enzyme|Enzyme| |carbonic_anhydrase|Carbonic_Anhydrase| , which effectively creates hydroxide ions at the active site.     Solutions containing the hydroxide ion attack  |glass|Glass| . In this case, the  |silicates|Silicate|  in glass are acting as acids. Basic hydroxides, whether solids or in solution, are stored in  |airtight|Airtight|  plastic containers.     The hydroxide ion can function as a typical electron-pair donor  |ligand|Ligand| , forming such complexes as tetrahydroxoaluminate/tetrahydroxido |aluminate|Aluminate|  − . It is also often found in mixed-ligand complexes of the type ML x y z+ , where L is a ligand. The hydroxide ion often serves as a  |bridging_ligand|Bridging_Ligand| , donating one pair of electrons to each of the atoms being bridged. As illustrated by 3+ , metal hydroxides are often written in a simplified format. It can even act as a 3-electron-pair donor, as in the tetramer 4 . Greenwood, p.  1168     When bound to a strongly electron-withdrawing metal centre, hydroxide ligands tend to  |ionise|Dissociation|  into oxide ligands. For example, the bichromate ion − dissociates according to   : −  2− + H +   with a pK a of about 5.9.  A comprehensive database of published data on equilibrium constants of metal complexes and ligands       The  |infrared_spectra|Infrared_Spectrum|  of compound containing the –OH  |functional_group|Functional_Group|  have strong  |absorption_bands|Spectral_Line|  in the region centered around 3500  cm −1 .  The high frequency of  |molecular_vibration|Molecular_Vibration|  is a consequence of the small mass of the hydrogen atom as compared to the mass of the oxygen atom and this makes detection of hydroxyl groups by infrared spectroscopy relatively easy. A band due to an OH group tends to be sharp. However, the  |band_width|Spectral_Linewidth|  increases when the OH group is involved in hydrogen bonding. A water molecule has an HOH bending mode at about 1600  cm −1 , so the absence of this band can be used to distinguish an OH group from a water molecule.     When the OH group is bound to a metal ion in a  |coordination_complex|Coordination_Complex| , an M−OH bending mode can be observed. For example, in 2− it occurs at 1065  cm −1 . The bending mode for a bridging hydroxide tends to be at a lower frequency as in Cu 2 Cu 2+ . Nakamoto, Part B, p.  57 M−OH stretching vibrations occur below about 600  cm −1 . For example, the  |tetrahedral|Tetrahedron|  ion 2− has bands at 470  cm −1  and 420  cm −1 . The same ion has a –Zn– bending vibration at 300  cm −1 .  Chapter 5.        |Sodium_hydroxide|Sodium_Hydroxide|  solutions, also known as  |lye|Lye|  and caustic soda, are used in the manufacture of  |pulp|Wood_Pulp|  and  |paper|Paper| ,  |textiles|Textile| ,  |drinking_water|Drinking_Water| ,  |soaps|Soap| , and  |detergents|Detergent| , and as a  |drain_cleaner|Drain_Cleaner| . Worldwide production in 2004 was approximately 60  million  |tonnes|Tonne| .  The principal method of manufacture is the  |chloralkali_process|Chloralkali_Process| .     Solutions containing the hydroxide ion are generated when a salt of a  |weak_acid|Weak_Acid|  is dissolved in water.  |Sodium_carbonate|Sodium_Carbonate|  is used as an alkali, for example, by virtue of the  |hydrolysis|Hydrolysis|  reaction   : + H 2 O   + OH −     Although the base strength of sodium carbonate solutions is lower than a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, it has the advantage of being a solid. It is also manufactured on a vast scale by the  |Solvay_process|Solvay_Process| . Kostick, Dennis . , chapter in 2005 Minerals Yearbook, United States Geological Survey. An example of the use of sodium carbonate as an alkali is when  |washing_soda|Washing_Soda|  acts on insoluble esters, such as  |triglycerides|Triglyceride| , commonly known as fats, to hydrolyze them and make them soluble.      |Bauxite|Bauxite| , a basic hydroxide of  |aluminium|Aluminium| , is the principal ore from which the metal is manufactured.  Similarly,  |goethite|Goethite|  and  |lepidocrocite|Lepidocrocite|  , basic hydroxides of  |iron|Iron| , are among the principal ores used for the manufacture of metallic iron.  Numerous other uses can be found in the articles on individual hydroxides.
