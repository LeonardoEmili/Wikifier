              Mary Wollstonecraft  was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of  |womens_rights|Womens_Rights| . Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecrafts life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time, received more attention than her writing. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding  |feminist_philosophers|Feminist_Philosophy| , and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences.     During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a  |travel_narrative|Travel_Literature| , a history of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| , a  |conduct_book|Conduct_Book| , and a childrens book. Wollstonecraft is best known for  A Vindication of the Rights of Woman  , in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a  |social_order|Social_Order|  founded on reason.     After Wollstonecrafts death, her widower published a  Memoir  of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the  |feminist_movement|Feminist_Movement|  at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecrafts advocacy of womens equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.     After two ill-fated affairs, with  |Henry_Fuseli|Henry_Fuseli|  and  |Gilbert_Imlay|Gilbert_Imlay|  , Wollstonecraft married the philosopher  |William_Godwin|William_Godwin| , one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter,  |Mary_Shelley|Mary_Shelley| , who would become an accomplished writer and author of  Frankenstein .           Wollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in  |Spitalfields|Spitalfields| , London.  She was the second of the seven children of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft.  Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecrafts youth. Tomalin, 9, 17, 24, 27; Sunstein, 11. The familys financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecrafts father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mothers bedroom to protect her. Todd, 11; Tomalin, 19; Wardle, 6; Sunstein, 16. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably  |postpartum_depression|Postpartum_Depression| , to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work. Todd, 45–57; Tomalin, 34–43; Wardle, 27–30; Sunstein, 80–91.     Two friendships shaped Wollstonecrafts early life. The first was with  |Jane_Arden|Jane_Gardiner|  in  |Beverley|Beverley| . The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Ardens father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: I have formed romantic notions of friendship  ... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none. Quoted in Todd, 16. In some of Wollstonecrafts letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life. See, for example, Todd, 72–75; Tomalin, 18–21; Sunstein, 22–33. The second and more important friendship was with  |Fanny_Blood|Fanny_Blood| , introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in  |Hoxton|Hoxton|  who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Todd, 22–24; Tomalin, 25–27; Wardle, 10–11; Sunstein, 39–42.     Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a  |ladys_companion|Ladys_Companion|  to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in  |Bath|Bath_Somerset| . However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman . In 1780 she returned home upon being called back to care for her dying mother. Wardle, 12–18; Sunstein 51–57. Rather than return to Dawsons employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to Fanny and her family throughout her life . Wardle, 20; Sunstein, 73–76.     Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially, but this dream collapsed under economic realities. In order to make a living, Wollstonecraft, her sisters, and Blood set up a school together in  |Newington_Green|Newington_Green| , a  |Dissenting|English_Dissenters|  community. Blood soon became engaged and after their marriage her husband, Hugh Skeys, took her to  |Lisbon|Lisbon| , Portugal, to improve her health, which had always been precarious. Todd, 62; Wardle, 30–32; Sunstein, 92–102. Despite the change of surroundings Bloods health further deteriorated when she became pregnant, and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her, but to no avail. Todd, 68–69; Tomalin, 52ff; Wardle, 43–45; Sunstein, 103–06. Moreover, her abandonment of the school led to its failure. Tomalin, 54–57. Bloods death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel,  Mary: A Fiction  . See Wardle, chapter 2, for autobiographical elements of Mary; see Sunstein, chapter 7.               After Bloods death in 1785, Wollstonecrafts friends helped her obtain a position as  |governess|Governess|  to the daughters of the  |Anglo_Irish|Anglo_Irish| |_Kingsborough_family|Baron_Kingsborough|  in Ireland. Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough, See, for example, Todd, 106–07; Tomalin, 66, 79–80; Sunstein, 127–28. the children found her an inspiring instructor;  |Margaret_King|Margaret_King|  would later say she had freed her mind from all superstitions. Todd, 116. Some of Wollstonecrafts experiences during this year would make their way into her only childrens book,  Original Stories from Real Life  . Tomalin, 64–88; Wardle, 60ff; Sunstein, 160–61.     Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women—an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of  Thoughts on the Education of Daughters  entitled Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune—she decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become the first of a new genus. Wollstonecraft, The Collected Letters, 139; see also Sunstein, 154. She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher  |Joseph_Johnson|Joseph_Johnson| , found a place to live and work to support herself. Todd, 123; Tomalin, 91–92; Wardle, 80–82; Sunstein, 151–55. She learned French and German and translated texts, Todd, 134–35. most notably Of the Importance of Religious Opinions by  |Jacques_Necker|Jacques_Necker|  and Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children by  |Christian_Gotthilf_Salzmann|Christian_Gotthilf_Salzmann| . She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnsons periodical, the  Analytical Review . Wollstonecrafts intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnsons famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer  |Thomas_Paine|Thomas_Paine|  and the philosopher  |William_Godwin|William_Godwin| . The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother. Tomalin, 89–109; Wardle, 92–94, 128; Sunstein, 171–75.     While in London, Wollstonecraft pursued a relationship with the artist  |Henry_Fuseli|Henry_Fuseli| , even though he was already married. She was, she wrote, enraptured by his genius, the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension, and lovely sympathy. Quoted in Todd, 153. She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife, but Fuselis wife was appalled, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft. Todd, 197–98; Tomalin 151–52; Wardle, 171–73, 76–77; Sunstein, 220–22. After Fuselis rejection, Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident, and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent  Vindication of the Rights of Men  . She had written the Rights of Men in response to the Whig MP  |Edmund_Burkes|Edmund_Burke|  politically conservative critique of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution|  in  Reflections on the Revolution in France  and it made her famous overnight. Reflections on the Revolution in France was published on 1 November 1790, and so angered Wollstonecraft that she spent the rest of the month writing her rebuttal. A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke was published on 29 November 1790, initially anonymously; Furniss 60 the second edition of A Vindication of the Rights of Men was published on 18 December, and this time the publisher revealed Wollstonecraft as the author.     Wollstonecraft called the French Revolution a glorious chance to obtain more virtue and happiness than hitherto blessed our globe. Furniss 61 Against Burkes dismissal of the Third Estate as men of no account, Wollstonecraft wrote, Time may show, that this obscure throng knew more of the human heart and of legislation than the profligates of rank, emasculated by hereditary effeminacy. About the events of 5–6 October 1789, when the royal family was marched from Versailles to Paris by a group of angry housewives, Burke praised Queen  |Marie_Antoinette|Marie_Antoinette|  as a symbol of the refined elegance of the ancien régime, who was surrounded by furies from hell, in the abused shape of the vilest of women. Wollstonecraft by contrast wrote of the same event: Probably you mean women who gained a livelihood by selling vegetables or fish, who never had any advantages of education.     Wollstonecraft was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist  |Joseph_Priestley|Joseph_Priestley|  and Paine, whose  Rights of Man  would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in  A Vindication of the Rights of Woman  , her most famous and influential work. Tomalin, 144–55; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202. Wollstonecrafts fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen  |Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand_Périgord|Charles_Maurice_De_Talleyrand_Périgord|  visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France. Furniss 63            Wollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before  |Louis_XVI_was_guillotined|Execution_Of_Louis_Xvi| . Britain and France were on the brink of war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go. Furniss 64. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British visitors such as  |Helen_Maria_Williams|Helen_Maria_Williams|  and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. Todd, 214–15; Tomalin, 156–82; Wardle, 179–84. During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate  |Girondins|Girondins|  rather than the more radical  |Jacobins|Jacobins| .     On 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found the tears flow insensibly from my eyes, when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity than I expected from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed. Furniss 65.     France declared war on Britain in February 1793. Wollstonecraft tried to leave France for Switzerland but was denied permission. Furniss 68. In March, the Jacobin-dominated  |Committee_of_Public_Safety|Committee_Of_Public_Safety|  came to power, instituting a totalitarian regime meant to mobilise France for the first  |total_war|Total_Warfrench_And_American_Revolutionary_Wars_And_Napoleonic_Wars| .     Life became very difficult for foreigners in France. Furniss 66. At first, they were put under police surveillance and, to get a residency permit, had to produce six written statements from Frenchmen testifying to their loyalty to the republic. Then, on 12 April 1793, all foreigners were forbidden to leave France. Furniss 67. Despite her sympathy for the revolution, life for Wollstonecraft become very uncomfortable, all the more so as the Girondins had lost out to the Jacobins. Some of Wollstonecrafts French friends lost their heads to the guillotine as the Jacobins set out to annihilate their enemies.       Having just written the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the  |French_Revolution|French_Revolution| , she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with  |Gilbert_Imlay|Gilbert_Imlay| , an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay even though they were not married, which was unacceptable behavior from a respectable British woman. Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealisation of the man. Despite her rejection of the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft discovered that Imlay awakened her interest in sex. Todd, 232–36; Tomalin, 185–86; Wardle, 185–88; Sunstein, 235–45.     Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France, writing that the people under the republic still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained venal and brutal. Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote:     I cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside the point of honour of the noblesse For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines.     Wollstonecraft was offended by the Jacobins treatment of women. They refused to grant women equal rights, denounced  |Amazons|Amazons| , and made it clear that women were supposed to conform to  |Jean_Jacques_Rousseaus|Jean_Jacques_Rousseau|  ideal of helpers to men. Gordon 215. On 16 October 1793,  |Marie_Antoinette|Marie_Antoinette|  was guillotined; among her charges and convictions, she was found guilty of committing incest with her son. Gordon 214–15. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled that the Jacobins would make Marie Antoinettes alleged perverse sexual acts one of the central reasons for the French people to hate her.     As the daily arrests and executions of the  |Reign_of_Terror|Reign_Of_Terror|  began, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion. She was, after all, a British citizen known to be a friend of leading Girondins. On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined; when Imlay broke the news to Wollstonecraft, she fainted. By this time, Imlay was taking advantage of the British blockade of France, which had caused shortages and worsened ever-growing inflation, by chartering ships to bring food and soap from America and dodge the British Royal Navy, goods that he could sell at a premium to Frenchmen who still had money. Imlays blockade-running gained the respect and support of some Jacobins, ensuring, as he had hoped, his freedom during the Terror. Gordon 215, 224. To protect Wollstonecraft from arrest, Imlay made a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her an American citizen. St Clair, 160; Furniss, 67; Sunstein, 262–63; Wardle, 192–93. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like  |Thomas_Paine|Thomas_Paine| , were arrested, and some were even guillotined. Her sisters believed she had been imprisoned.     Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins nightmarish. There were gigantic daytime parades requiring everyone to show themselves and lustily cheer lest they be suspected of inadequate commitment to the republic, as well as nighttime police raids to arrest enemies of the republic. In a March 1794 letter to her sister Everina, Wollstonecraft wrote:     It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind ... death and misery, in every shape of terrour, haunts this devoted country—I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded.     Wollstonecraft soon became pregnant by Imlay, and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child,  |Fanny|Fanny_Imlay| , naming her after perhaps her closest friend. Tomalin, 218; Wardle, 202–03; Sunstein, 256–57. Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend, My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R s of Woman . Quoted in Wardle, 202. She continued to write avidly, despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country, but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at  |Le_Havre|Le_Havre|  in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution, which was published in London in December 1794. Tomalin, 211–19; Wardle, 206–14; Sunstein, 254–55. Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her. He promised that he would return to her and Fanny at Le Havre, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, which most critics explain as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman, while others say they resulted from her circumstances—a foreign woman alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution that had seen good friends imprisoned or executed. Todd, Chapter 25; Tomalin, 220–31; Wardle, 215ff; Sunstein, 262ff.     An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution |freedom_of_the_press|Freedom_Of_The_Press|  in France, which led her to return to Paris. In August 1794, Imlay departed for London and promised to return soon. In 1793, the British government had begun a crackdown on radicals, suspending civil liberties, imposing drastic censorship, and trying for treason anyone suspected of sympathy with the revolution, which led Wollstonecraft to fear she would be imprisoned if she returned.     The winter of 1794–95 was the coldest winter in Europe for over a century, which reduced Wollstonecraft and her daughter Fanny to desperate circumstances. Furniss 67–68. The river Seine froze that winter, which made it impossible for ships to bring food and coal to Paris, leading to widespread starvation and deaths from the cold in the city. Gordon 243. Wollstonecraft continued to write to Imlay, asking him to return to France at once, declaring she still had faith in the revolution and did not wish to return to Britain. After she left France on 7 April 1795, she continued to refer to herself as Mrs Imlay, even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child. Tomalin, 225.     The British historian Tom Furniss called An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution the most neglected of Wollstonecrafts books. It was first published in London in 1794, but a second edition did not appear until 1989. Later generations were more interested in her feminist writings rather than her account of the French Revolution, which Furniss has called her best work. Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian, but she used all sorts of journals, letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the revolution. She was trying to counteract what Furniss called the hysterical anti-revolutionary mood in Britain, which depicted the revolution as due to the entire French nations going mad. Wollstonecraft argued instead that the revolution arose from a set of social, economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789.     An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution was a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft. She condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror, but at same time she argued that the revolution was a great achievement, which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 1793–94. Furniss 68–69. Edmund Burke had ended his Reflections on the Revolution in France with reference to the events of 5–6 October 1789, when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris. Furniss 72. Burke called the women furies from hell, while Wollstonecraft defended them as ordinary housewives angry about the lack of bread to feed their families. Against Burkes idealised portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob, Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a femme fatale, a seductive, scheming and dangerous woman. Callender 384 Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy corrupted women in a monarchy because womens main purpose in such a society was to bear sons to continue a dynasty, which essentially reduced a womans value to her womb. Moreover, Wollstonecraft pointed out that unless a queen was a  |queen_regnant|Queen_Regnant| , most queens were  |queen_consorts|Queen_Consort| , which meant a woman had to exercise influence via her husband or son, encouraging her to become more and more manipulative. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values, by emphasising a womans body and her ability to be charming over her mind and character, had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless, making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the ancien régime.       Seeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her. In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide, probably with  |laudanum|Laudanum| , but Imlay saved her life . Todd, 286–87; Wardle, 225. In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia, trying to recoup some of his losses. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as  Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark  in 1796. Tomalin, 225–31; Wardle, 226–44; Sunstein, 277–90. When she returned to England and came to the full realization that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:             She then went out on a rainy night and to make her clothes heavy with water, she walked up and down about half an hour before jumping into the  |River_Thames|River_Thames| , but a stranger saw her jump and rescued her. Todd, 355–56; Tomalin, 232–36; Wardle, 245–46. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured. Todd, 357.     Gradually, Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life, becoming involved with  |Joseph_Johnsons|Joseph_Johnson|  circle again, in particular with  |Mary_Hays|Mary_Hays| ,  |Elizabeth_Inchbald|Elizabeth_Inchbald| , and  |Sarah_Siddons|Sarah_Siddons|  through  |William_Godwin|William_Godwin| . Godwin and Wollstonecrafts unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. St. Clair, 164–69; Tomalin, 245–70; Wardle, 268ff; Sunstein, 314–20. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise  Political Justice . St. Clair, 172–74; Tomalin, 271–73; Sunstein, 330–35. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, Godwin and Wollstonecraft moved to 29 The Polygon,  |Somers_Town|Somers_Town_London| . Godwin rented an apartment 20 doors away at 17 Evesham Buildings in Chalton Street as a study, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter.  Sunstein has printed several of these letters in order so that the reader can follow Wollstonecraft and Godwins conversation By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship. St. Clair, 173; Wardle, 286–92; Sunstein, 335–40.            On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter,  |Mary|Mary_Shelley| . Although the delivery seemed to go well initially, the  |placenta|Placenta|  broke apart during the birth and became infected;  |childbed_fever|Puerperal_Fever|  was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. Gordon, 356 After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of  |septicaemia|Septicaemia|  on 10 September. Todd, 450–56; Tomalin, 275–83; Wardle, 302–06; Sunstein, 342–47. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend  |Thomas_Holcroft|Thomas_Holcroft| , I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again. Quoted in C. Kegan Paul, http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchistArchives/godwin/friends/toc.html William Godwin: His Friends and Contemporaries, London: Henry S. King and Co. . Retrieved 11 March 2007. She was buried at  |Old_Saint_Pancras_Churchyard|St_Pancras_Old_Church| , where her tombstone reads, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of WomanMemoirs Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and sincerity, many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecrafts illegitimate children, love affairs, and suicide attempts. St. Clair, 182–88; Tomalin, 289–97; Sunstein, 349–51; Sapiro, 272. The  |Romantic|Romanticism|  poet  |Robert_Southey|Robert_Southey|  accused him of the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked and vicious satires such as  The Unsexd Females  were published.  |Robert_Southey|Robert_Southey|  to  |William_Taylor|William_Taylor| , 1 July 1804. A Memoir of the Life and Writings of William Taylor of Norwich. Ed. J.W. Robberds. 2 vols. London: John Murray 1:504. Godwins Memoirs portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic than her own writings suggest. Sapiro, 273–74. Godwins views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as Wollstonecraft and Fuseli by British poet  |Robert_Browning|Robert_Browning|  and that by  |William_Roscoe|William_Roscoe|  which includes the lines: Quoted in Sapiro, 273.     :Hard was thy fate in all the scenes of life   :As daughter, sister, mother, friend, and wife;   :But harder still, thy fate in death we own,   :Thus mournd by Godwin with a heart of stone.       In 1851, Wollstonecrafts remains were moved by her grandson  |Percy_Florence_Shelley|Percy_Florence_Shelley|  to his family tomb in  |St_Peters_Church_Bournemouth|St_Peters_Church_Bournemouth| . Gordon, 446. Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of  |Sir_John_Soanes|Sir_John_Soane|  grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin .                   Wollstonecraft has what scholar Cora Kaplan labelled in 2002 a curious legacy that has evolved over time: for an author-activist adept in many genres  ... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecrafts life has been read much more closely than her writing . Kaplan, Wollstonecrafts reception , 247. After the devastating effect of Godwins Memoirs, Wollstonecrafts reputation lay in tatters for nearly a century; she was pilloried by such writers as  |Maria_Edgeworth|Maria_Edgeworth| , who patterned the freakish Harriet Freke in  Belinda  after her. Other novelists such as  |Mary_Hays|Mary_Hays| ,  |Charlotte_Turner_Smith|Charlotte_Turner_Smith| ,  |Fanny_Burney|Fanny_Burney| , and  |Jane_West|Jane_West|  created similar figures, all to teach a moral lesson to their readers. Favret, 131–32.  |Pennell_Elizabeth_Robins|Elizabeth_Robins_Pennell| . Life of Mary Wollstonecraft , 351.      In contrast, there was one writer of the generation after Wollstonecraft who apparently did not share the judgmental views of her contemporaries.  |Jane_Austen|Jane_Austen|  never mentioned the earlier woman by name, but several of her novels contain positive allusions to Wollstonecrafts work. Mellor 156. The American literary scholar  |Anne_K_Mellor|Anne_K_Mellor|  notes several examples. In  Pride and Prejudice , Mr Wickham seems to be based upon the sort of man Wollstonecraft claimed that  |standing_armies|Standing_Army|  produce, while the sarcastic remarks of protagonist  |Elizabeth_Bennet|Elizabeth_Bennet|  about female accomplishments closely echo Wollstonecrafts condemnation of these activities. The balance a woman must strike between feelings and reason in  Sense and Sensibility  follows what Wollstonecraft recommended in her novel Mary, while the moral equivalence Austen drew in  Mansfield Park  between slavery and the treatment of women in British society tracks one of Wollstonecrafts favorite arguments. In  Persuasion , Austens characterization of Anne Eliot as better qualified than her father to manage the family estate also echoes a Wollstonecraft thesis.     Scholar  |Virginia_Sapiro|Virginia_Sapiro|  states that few read Wollstonecrafts works during the nineteenth century as her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work . Sapiro, 274.  If readers were few, then many were inspired; one such reader was  |Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning|Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning| , who read Rights of Woman at age 12 and whose poem  Aurora Leigh  reflected Wollstonecrafts unwavering focus on education. Gordon, 449  |Lucretia_Mott|Lucretia_Mott| , Sapiro, 276–77. a Quaker minister, and  |Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton|Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton| , Americans who met in 1840 at the  |World_Anti_Slavery_Convention|World_Anti_Slavery_Convention|  in London, discovered they both had read Wollstonecraft, and they agreed upon the need for the  |Seneca_Falls_Convention|Seneca_Falls_Convention| ,  an influential womens rights meeting held in 1848. Another woman who read Wollstonecraft was  |George_Eliot|George_Eliot| , a prolific writer of reviews, articles, novels, and translations. In 1855, she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women, comparing Wollstonecraft and  |Margaret_Fuller|Margaret_Fuller| . Fuller was an American journalist, critic, and womens rights activist who, like Wollstonecraft, had travelled to the Continent and had been involved in the struggle for  |reform|Reform|  —and she had a child by a man without marrying him.  |Dickenson_Donna|Donna_Dickenson| .

With the emergence of  |feminist_criticism|Feminist_Criticism|  in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecrafts works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the  |second_wave|Second_Wave_Feminism|  of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her passionate life in  |apposition|Wikt_Apposition|  to radical and rationalist agenda .

Retrieved 6 August 2015.  In the 1980s and 1990s, yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged, one which described her as much more a creature of her time; scholars such as Claudia Johnson, Gary Kelly, and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecrafts thought and other important eighteenth-century ideas regarding topics such as  |sensibility|Sensibility| , economics, and political theory.     Wollstonecrafts work has also had an effect on feminism outside the academy in recent years.  |Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali|Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali| , a political writer and  |former_Muslim|List_Of_Former_Muslimspart_Of_An_Unorganized_Religion_Or_No_Religion|  who is  |critical_of_Islam|Criticism_Of_Islam|  in general and  |its_dictates_regarding_women|Women_And_Islam|  in particular, cited the Rights of Woman in her autobiography  Infidel  and wrote that she was inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights .  |Hirsi_Ali_Ayaan|Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali| .

She has also inspired more widely.  |Nobel_Laureate|Nobel_Memorial_Prize_In_Economic_Sciences| |_Amartya_Sen|Amartya_Sen| , the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the  |missing_women_of_Asia|Missing_Women_Of_Asia| , draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in  The Idea of Justice .      Several plaques have been erected to honour Wollstonecraft.                      The majority of Wollstonecrafts early productions are about education; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts for the improvement of young women entitled The Female Reader and she translated two childrens works, Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambons Young Grandison and  |Christian_Gotthilf_Salzmanns|Christian_Gotthilf_Salzmann|  Elements of Morality. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her  |conduct_book|Conduct_Book|  Thoughts on the Education of Daughters and her  |childrens_book|Childrens_Literature|  Original Stories from Real Life , Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos: self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and social contentment. Jones, Literature of advice , 122–26; Kelly, 58–59. Both books also emphasize the importance of teaching children to reason, revealing Wollstonecrafts intellectual debt to the important seventeenth-century educational philosopher  |John_Locke|John_Locke| . Richardson, 24–27; Myers, Impeccable Governesses , 38. However, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of  |sensibility|Sensibility|  popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Jones, Literature of advice , 124–29; Richardson, 24–27. Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in  A Vindication of the Rights of Woman . Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation. Richardson, 25–27; Jones, Literature of advice , 124; Myers, Impeccable Governesses , 37–39.     Vindications Vindication of the Rights of Men      Published in response to  |Edmund_Burkes|Edmund_Burke|   Reflections on the Revolution in France  , which was a defence of  |constitutional_monarchy|Constitutional_Monarchy| , aristocracy, and the  |Church_of_England|Church_Of_England| , and an attack on Wollstonecrafts friend, the Rev  |Richard_Price|Richard_Price|  at the  |Newington_Green_Unitarian_Church|Newington_Green_Unitarian_Church| , Wollstonecrafts A Vindication of the Rights of Men attacks  |aristocracy|Aristocracy|  and advocates  |republicanism|Republicanism| . Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the  Revolution Controversy , in which  |Thomas_Paines|Thomas_Paine|   Rights of Man  became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals.     Wollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the Reflections, Burke had lamented: I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her  |Marie_Antoinette|Marie_Antoinette|  with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone. Qtd. in Butler, 44. Most of Burkes detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was at the expense of the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burkes gendered language. By redefining the  |sublime|Sublime|  and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in  A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful  , she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical tableaux turn Burkes readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 45; Johnson, 26; Sapiro, 121–22; Kelly, 90, 97–98. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar  |Claudia_L_Johnson|Claudia_L_Johnson|  argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165. Wollstonecraft indicts Burkes defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.     In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94–95; Todd, 164. Influenced by  |Enlightenment|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burkes system would lead to the continuation of  |slavery|Slavery| , simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 44. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her  |utopia|Utopia| n picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burkes false feeling. Jones, Political tradition , 44–46; Sapiro, 216.     The Rights of Men was Wollstonecrafts first overtly political work, as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends, it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career. Johnson, 29. It was this text that made her a well-known writer.     Vindication of the Rights of Woman      A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education  |commensurate|Wikt_Commensurate|  with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be companions to their husbands rather than mere wives. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 192. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond vitriolically to  |conduct_book|Conduct_Book|  writers such as  |James_Fordyce|James_Fordyce|  and  |John_Gregory|John_Gregory|  and educational philosophers such as  |Jean_Jacques_Rousseau|Jean_Jacques_Rousseau| , who wanted to deny women an education.  Kelly, 123, 126; Taylor, 14–15; Sapiro, 27–28, 13–31, 243–44.      Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial , but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that womens deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: Taught from their infancy that beauty is womans sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 157. She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more. Kelly, 124–26; Taylor, 14–15.     While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. See, for example Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 126, 146. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 110. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 135. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word did not come into existence until the 1890s. The words feminist and feminism were coined in the 1890s. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved 17 September 2007; see Taylor, 12, 55–57, 105–06, 118–20; Sapiro, 257–59.     One of Wollstonecrafts most scathing critiques in the Rights of Woman is of false and excessive  |sensibility|Sensibility| , particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are blown about by every momentary gust of feeling and because they are the prey of their senses they cannot think rationally. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 177. In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. Jones, 46.     In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the Rights of Woman, On National Education , she argues that all children should be sent to a country day school as well as given some education at home to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures. She also maintains that schooling should be  |co_educational|Coeducation| , arguing that men and women, whose marriages are the cement of society , should be educated after the same model. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, Chapter 12; see also Kelly, 124–25, 133–34; Sapiro, 237ff.     Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class, which she describes as the most natural state , and in many ways the Rights of Woman is inflected by a  |bourgeois|Bourgeoisie|  view of the world. Kelly, 128ff; Taylor, 167–68; Sapiro, 27. It encourages  |modesty|Modesty|  and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 311; see also Taylor, 159–61; Sapiro, 91–92.               Both of Wollstonecrafts novels criticize what she viewed as the  |patriarchal|Wikt_Patriarchal|  institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, Mary: A Fiction , the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate  |romantic_friendships|Romantic_Friendship| , one with a woman and one with a man. Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman , an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecrafts most radical feminist work, Taylor, Chapter 9. revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecrafts novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman. At the end of Mary, the heroine believes she is going to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage , Wollstonecraft, Mary, 68. presumably a positive state of affairs. Poovey, 100–01; Taylor, 232–33.     Both of Wollstonecrafts novels also critique the discourse of  |sensibility|Sensibility| , a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroines indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental. Johnson, 60, 65–66; Kelly, 44; Poovey, 89; Taylor, 135; Todd, Womens Friendship, 210–11.     Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecrafts novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women. Todd, Womens Friendship, 208, 221–22; Johnson, 67–68; Taylor, 233, 243–44; Sapiro, 155.     Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark      Wollstonecrafts Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is a deeply personal  |travel_narrative|Travel_Literature| . The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with  |Imlay|Gilbert_Imlay|  . Using the rhetoric of the  |sublime|Sublime| , Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of  |Rousseau|Jean_Jacques_Rousseau| , Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark shares the themes of the French philosophers  Reveries of a Solitary Walker  : the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding . Favret, 104; Sapiro, 286–87. While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text. Favret, 105–06.        Wollstonecraft promotes subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and  |sensibility|Sensibility| . Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecrafts desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. Myers, Wollstonecrafts Letters , 167, 180; Poovey, 83–84, 106; Kelly, 189–90. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. Myers, Wollstonecrafts Letters , 174; Favret, 96, 120, 127. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay. Favret, 119ff; Poovey, 93; Myers, Wollstonecrafts Letters , 177; Kelly, 179–81.     Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecrafts most popular book in the 1790s. It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics.  |Godwin|William_Godwin|  wrote if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.
