        Beauty is the ascription of a property or characteristic to an  |animal|Animal| ,  |idea|Idea| ,  |object|Object| , person or  |place|Location|  that provides a  |perceptual|Perception|  experience of  |pleasure|Pleasure|  or  |satisfaction|Contentment| . Beauty is studied as part of  |aesthetics|Aesthetics| ,  |culture|Culture| ,  |social_psychology|Social_Psychology| ,  |philosophy|Philosophy|  and  |sociology|Sociology| . An ideal beauty is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.  |Ugliness|Unattractiveness|  is the opposite of beauty.     The experience of beauty often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and  |harmony|Harmony|  with  |nature|Nature| , which may lead to feelings of  |attraction|Sexual_Attraction|  and  |emotional_well-being|Emotional_Well-Being| . Because this can be a  |subjective|Subjectivity|  experience, it is often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Often, given the observation that empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful often align among groups in consensus, beauty has been stated to have levels of  |objectivity|Objectivity|  and partial subjectivity which are not fully subjective in their aesthetic judgement.       The classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words beauty or beautiful was  |κάλλος|Wikt:Κάλλος| , kallos, and the adjective was καλός, kalos. However, kalos may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, kallos was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.      The  |Koine_Greek|Koine_Greek|  word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, hōraios, Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65 an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, hōra, meaning hour . In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with being of ones hour . Euripides, Alcestis 515. Thus, a ripe fruit was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, hōraios had many meanings, including youthful and ripe old age .     The  |earliest_Western_theory_of_beauty|Beauty|  can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the  |pre-Socratic|Pre-Socratic|  period, such as  |Pythagoras|Pythagoras| . The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between  |mathematics|Mathematics|  and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the  |golden_ratio|Golden_Ratio|  seemed more attractive. Seife, Charles .  Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea . Penguin. . p. 32  |Ancient_Greek_architecture|Ancient_Greek_Architecture|  is based on this view of symmetry and  |proportion|Ratio| .     Plato considered beauty to be the Idea above all other Ideas. Phaedrus Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful  and virtue, arguing that Virtue aims at the beautiful. Nicomachean Ethics      |Classical_philosophy|Classical_Philosophy|  and sculptures of men and women produced according to the  |Greek_philosophers|Ancient_Greek_Philosophy|  tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a classical ideal . In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose  |appearance|Human_Physical_Appearance|  conforms to these tenets is still called a classical beauty or said to possess a classical beauty , whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty and female beauty in western civilization as seen, for example, in the  Winged Victory of Samothrace . During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later,  |Renaissance|Renaissance|  and  |Humanist|Humanism|  thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects  criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of  |Gothic_art|Gothic_Art|  lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.       In the  |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| ,  |Catholic_philosophers|Catholic_Philosopher|  like  |Thomas_Aquinas|Thomas_Aquinas|  included beauty among the  |transcendental|Transcendentals|  attributes of  |being|Being| . In his  |Summa_Theologica|Summa_Theologica| , Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas , consonantia , claritas      In the Gothic Architecture of the  |High|High_Middle_Ages|  and  |Late|Late_Middle_Ages| |Middle_Ages|Middle_Ages| , light was considered the most beautiful revelation of  |God|God| , which was heralded in design. Examples are the  |stained_glass|Stained_Glassmedieval_Glass_In_Europe|  of Gothic  |Cathedrals|Cathedral|  including  |Notre-Dame_de_Paris|Notre-Dame_De_Paris|  and  |Chartes_Cathedral|Chartes_Cathedral| .            The  |Age_of_Reason|Age_Of_Enlightenment|  saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher  |Francis_Hutcheson|Francis_Hutcheson|  argued that beauty is unity in variety and variety in unity . An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the  |nature|Nature|  of beauty, with  |John_Keats|John_Keats|  arguing in Ode on a Grecian Urn that:     : Beauty is truth, truth beauty, —that is all   : Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.       In the Romantic period,  |Edmund_Burke|Edmund_Burke|  postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the  |sublime|Sublime| . The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and  |Kant|Immanuel_Kant| , suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.       The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in  |postmodernisms|Postmodernism|  anti-aesthetics. The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernisms main influences,  |Friedrich_Nietzsche|Friedrich_Nietzsche| , who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty. The Will to Power     In the aftermath of postmodernisms rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher  |Guy_Sircello|Guy_Sircello|  proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept. A New Theory of Beauty. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975. Love and Beauty. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989. Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice. On Beauty and Being Just     Beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of  |experimental_aesthetics|Experimental_Aesthetics|  and  |neuroesthetics|Neuroesthetics|  respectively. Psychological theories see beauty as a form of  |pleasure|Pleasure| .   Correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing.    Some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial  |orbitofrontal_cortex|Orbitofrontal_Cortex| .   This approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field.              The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of inner beauty, which includes psychological factors such as  |personality|Personality_Type| ,  |intelligence|Intelligence| ,  |grace|Wiktionary:Grace| ,  |politeness|Politeness| ,  |charisma|Charisma| ,  |integrity|Integrity| ,  |congruence|Wikt:Congruence|  and  |elegance|Elegance| , and outer beauty  which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.     Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.     A strong indicator of physical beauty is  |averageness|Averageness|  .  Strauss, M.S. . Abstraction of prototypical information by adults and 10-month-old infants. J. Exp. Psychol.: Human Learn. Mem. 5, 618–632. Rhodes, G., Tremewan, T. Averageness, exaggeration, and facial attractiveness. Psychol. Sci.  7, 105–110. Valentine, T., Darling, S., Donnelly, M. . Why are average faces attractive? The effect of view and averageness on the attractiveness of the attractiveness of female faces. Psychon. Bull. Rev. 11, 482–487  When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the ideal image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when  |Francis_Galton|Francis_Galton|  overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images. Galton, F. . Composite portraits, made by combining those of many different persons in a single resultant figure.  J. Anthropol. Inst.  8, 132–144. Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer-generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces.  It is argued that it is evolutionarily advantageous that sexual creatures are attracted to mates who possess predominantly common or average features, because it suggests the  |absence_of_genetic_or_acquired_defects|Koinophilia| .

Oxford: Oxford University Press.  There is also evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in infancy, and is probably innate, Slater, A.M., Von Der Schulenburg, C., Brown, E., et al. . Newborn infants prefer attractive faces. Infant Behav. Dev.  21, 345–354. Kramer, S., Zebrowitz, L.A., San Giovanni, J.P., Sherak, B. . Infants preferences for attractiveness and babyfaceness.

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a  |waist–hip_ratio|Waist–Hip_Ratio|  of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with  |hourglass_figures|Female_Body_Shape|  are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.   However, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal. For instance, in some non-Western cultures in which women have to do work such as finding food, men tend to have preferences for higher waist-hip ratios.        Beauty standards are rooted in cultural norms crafted by societies and media over centuries. Globally, it is argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a  |Eurocentric|Eurocentrism|  concept of beauty, breeding cultures that assign inferiority to women of color.  Thus, societies and cultures across the globe struggle to diminish the longstanding  |internalized_racism|Internalized_Racism| .  The  |black_is_beautiful|Black_Is_Beautiful|  cultural movement sought to dispel this notion in the 1960s.      Exposure to the thin ideal in mass media, such as fashion magazines, directly correlates with body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and the development of eating disorders among female viewers.   Further, the widening gap between individual body sizes and societal ideals continues to breed anxiety among young girls as they grow, highlighting the dangerous nature of beauty standards in society.      The concept of beauty in men is known as  |bishōnen|Bishōnen|  in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly  |feminine|Femininity|  features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their  |pop_culture|Popular_Culture| |idols|Japanese_Idol| . A multibillion-dollar industry of  |Japanese_Aesthetic_Salons|Japanese_Aesthetic_Salons|  exists for this reason. However, different nations have varying male beauty ideals; Eurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity; thus, these features are idolized through American media, such as in  |Hollywood|Cinema_Of_The_United_States|  films and magazine covers.        The prevailing eurocentric concept of beauty has varying effects on different cultures. Primarily, adherence to this standard among African American women has bred a lack of positive reification of African beauty, and philosopher  |Cornel_West|Cornel_West|  elaborates that, much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair.  These insecurities can be traced back to global idealization of women with light skin, green or blue eyes, and long straight or wavy hair in magazines and media that starkly contrast with the natural features of African women.      In East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals; professor and scholar Stephanie Wongs experimental study concluded that expecting that men in Asian culture didnt like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices made by Asian American women.   In addition to the male gaze, media portrayals of Asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in American media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among Asian American women who dont fit either of these beauty ideals. Further, the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to Asian societal history; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor, manual labor, cultivating a visual divide over time between lighter complexioned, wealthier families and sun tanned, darker laborers. This along with the Eurocentric beauty ideals embedded in Asian culture has made skin lightening creams,  |rhinoplasty|Rhinoplasty| , and  |blepharoplasty|Blepharoplasty|  commonplace among Asian women, illuminating the insecurity that results from cultural beauty standards.       Much criticism has been directed at models of beauty which depend solely upon Western ideals of beauty as seen for example in the  |Barbie|Barbie|  model franchise. Criticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model of beauty and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become  |anorexic|Anorexia_Nervosa| . Helga Dittmar, Emma Halliwell, and Suzanne Ive, Does Barbie make girls want to be thin? The effect of experimental exposure to images of dolls on the body image of 5-to 8-year-old girls. Developmental psychology 422 : 283.     These criticisms have led to a constructive dialogue to enhance the presence of non-exclusive models of Western ideals in body type and beauty. Complaints also point to a lack of diversity in such franchises as the  |Barbie|Barbie|  model of beauty in Western culture. Marco Tosa, Barbie: Four decades of fashion, fantasy, and fun . Mattel responded to these criticisms. Starting in 1980, it produced Hispanic dolls, and later came models from across the globe. For example, in 2007, it introduced Cinco de Mayo Barbie wearing a ruffled red, white, and green dress . Hispanic magazine reports that:                Beauty presents a standard of  |comparison|Social_Comparison_Theory| , and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the beauty ideal may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom  Ugly Betty  portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to societys unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In  Malèna , a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may woo their husbands. The documentary  Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld  explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.     Researchers have found that good-looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance.  Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive defendants are less likely to be convicted—and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences—than less attractive ones . Amina A Memon, Aldert Vrij, Ray Bull . Psychology and Law: Truthfulness, Accuracy and Credibility. John Wiley & Sons. pp. 46–47.  Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author  |Eva_Ritvo|Eva_Ritvo|  show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.      How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary-looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good-looking.  In the market for loans, the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals, although they are less likely to default. In the marriage market, womens looks are at a premium, but mens looks do not matter much.      Conversely, being very unattractive increases the individuals propensity for criminal activity for a number of crimes ranging from burglary to theft to selling illicit drugs.      Discrimination against others based on their appearance is known as  |lookism|Lookism| . Gough, L. . C. Northcote Parkinsons Parkinsons law. Oxford, U.K: Infinite Ideas Ltd. p. 36.         |St._Augustine|Augustine_Of_Hippo|  said of beauty Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.      Philosopher and novelist  |Umberto_Eco|Umberto_Eco|  wrote  On Beauty: A History of a Western Idea   and  On Ugliness  .  A character in his novel  The Name of the Rose  declares: three things concur in creating beauty: first of all integrity or perfection, and for this reason we consider ugly all incomplete things; then proper proportion or consonance; and finally clarity and light , before going on to say the sight of the beautiful implies peace .
