        Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 , was a  |U_S_Supreme_Court|U_S_Supreme_Court|  case that established the principle of  |judicial_review|Judicial_Review|  in the United States, meaning that American courts have the power to strike down laws, statutes, and some government actions that violate the  |Constitution_of_the_United_States|Constitution_Of_The_United_States| . Decided in 1803, Marbury remains the single most important decision in American constitutional law. The Courts landmark decision established that the U.S. Constitution is actual law , not just a statement of political principles and ideals, and helped define the boundary between the  |constitutionally_separate|Separation_Of_Powers| |_executive|Executive|  and  |judicial|Judiciary|  branches of the  |American_form_of_government|Federal_Government_Of_The_United_States| .     The case originated from an incident that occurred as part of the political and ideological rivalry between outgoing  |President|U_S_President| |_John_Adams|John_Adams| , who espoused the pro-business and pro-national government ideals of  |Alexander_Hamilton|Alexander_Hamilton|  and the  |Federalist_Party|Federalist_Party| , and incoming President  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson| , who favored agriculture and decentralization and led the  |Democratic_Republican_Party|Democratic_Republican_Party| . Adams had lost the  |U_S_presidential_election_of_1800|1800_United_States_Presidential_Election|  to Jefferson, and in March 1801, just two days before his term as president ended, Adams appointed several dozen Federalist Party supporters to new circuit judge and  |justice_of_the_peace|Justice_Of_The_Peace|  positions in an attempt to frustrate Jefferson and his supporters in the Democratic-Republican Party. The  |U_S_Senate|United_States_Senate|  quickly confirmed Adamss appointments, but upon Adams departure and Jeffersons inauguration a few of the new judges commissions still had not been delivered. Jefferson believed the commissions were void because they had not been delivered in time, and instructed his new  |Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State| ,  |James_Madison|James_Madison| , not to deliver them. One of the men whose commissions had not been delivered in time was  |William_Marbury|William_Marbury| , a Maryland businessman who had been a strong supporter of Adams and the Federalists. In late 1801, after Madison had repeatedly refused to deliver his commission, Marbury filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court asking the Court to issue a  |writ_of_mandamus|Writ_Of_Mandamus|  forcing Madison to deliver his commission.     In an opinion written by  |Chief_Justice|Chief_Justice_Of_The_United_States| |_John_Marshall|John_Marshall| , the Court held firstly that Madisons refusal to deliver Marburys commission was illegal, and secondly that it was normally proper for a court in such situations to order the government official in question to deliver the commission. However, in Marburys case, the Court did not order Madison to comply. Examining the law Congress had passed that gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction over types of cases like Marburys, Marshall found that it had expanded the definition of the Supreme Courts jurisdiction beyond what was originally set down in the  |U_S_Constitution|United_States_Constitution| . Marshall then struck down the law, announcing that American courts have the power to invalidate laws that they find to violate the Constitution. Because this meant the Court had no jurisdiction over the case, it could not issue the writ that Marbury had requested.            In the fiercely contested  |U_S_presidential_election_of_1800|1800_United_States_Presidential_Election| , the three major candidates were President  |John_Adams|John_Adams| , who was running for re-election, along with  |Thomas_Jefferson|Thomas_Jefferson|  and  |Aaron_Burr|Aaron_Burr| . Adams was aligned with the pro-business and pro-national government politics of  |Alexander_Hamilton|Alexander_Hamilton|  and the  |Federalist_Party|Federalist_Party| , while Jefferson and Burr were part of the opposing  |Democratic_Republican_Party|Democratic_Republican_Party| , which favored agriculture and decentralization. American public opinion had gradually turned against the Federalists in the months prior to the election, mainly due to their use of the controversial  |Alien_and_Sedition_Acts|Alien_And_Sedition_Acts| , as well as growing tensions with  |Great_Britain|Great_Britain| , with whom the Federalists favored close ties. Jefferson easily won the popular vote, but only narrowly defeated Adams in the  |Electoral_College|Electoral_College| .     As the results of the election became clear in early 1801, Adams and the Federalists became determined to exercise their influence in the weeks remaining before Jefferson took office, and did all they could to fill federal offices with anti-Jeffersonians who were loyal to the Federalists. On March 2, 1801, just two days before his presidential term ended, Adams nominated nearly 60 Federalist supporters to  |circuit_judge|United_States_Circuit_Court|  and  |justice_of_the_peace|Justice_Of_The_Peace|  positions the Federalist-controlled Congress had newly created with the  |Judiciary_Act_of_1801|Judiciary_Act_Of_1801| . These last-minute nomineeswhom Jeffersons supporters derisively referred to as the  |Midnight_Judges|Midnight_Judges|  included  |William_Marbury|William_Marbury| , a prosperous businessman from  |Maryland|Maryland| . An ardent Federalist, Marbury was active in Maryland politics and had been a vigorous supporter of the Adams presidency.     The following day, March 3, the  |Senate|United_States_Senate|  approved Adamss nominations en masse. The appointees commissions were immediately written out, then signed by Adams and sealed by his  |Secretary_of_State|United_States_Secretary_Of_State| ,  |John_Marshall|John_Marshall| , who had been named the new  |Chief_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court|Chief_Justice_Of_The_United_States|  in January but continued also serving as Secretary of State for the remainder of Adamss term. Marshall then dispatched his younger brother  |James_Markham_Marshall|James_Markham_Marshall|  to deliver the commissions to the appointees. With only one day left before Jeffersons inauguration, James Marshall was able to deliver most of the commissions, but a fewincluding Marburyswere not delivered.     The day after, March 4, 1801, Thomas Jefferson was sworn in and became the third President of the United States. As soon as he was able, Jefferson instructed his new Secretary of State,  |James_Madison|James_Madison| , to withhold the undelivered appointments. In Jeffersons opinion, the commissions were void because they had not been delivered in time. Without the commissions, the appointees were unable to assume the offices and duties to which they had been appointed.     Over the next several months, Madison continually refused to deliver Marburys commission to him. Finally, in December 1801, Marbury filed suit against Madison in the  |U_S_Supreme_Court|Supreme_Court_Of_The_United_States| , asking the Court to issue a  |writ_of_mandamus|Writ_Of_Mandamus|  forcing Madison to deliver his commission. This lawsuit resulted in the case of Marbury v. Madison.             On February 24, 1803, the Court rendered a unanimous 4â€“0 decision against Marbury. The Courts decision was delayed by one year because, in retaliation for the Adams appointment of the Midnight Judges , Jefferson and the new Democratic-Republican Congressmen successfully passed a bill that canceled the Supreme Courts 1802 term, and so all pending casesincluding Marbury v. Madisonwere not decided until 1803.     The Courts opinion was written by the Chief Justice, John Marshall. Marshall structured the Courts opinion around a series of three questions that Marshall answered in turn:   First, did Marbury have a right to his commission?   Second, if Marbury had a right to his commission, was there a legal remedy for him to obtain it?   Third, if there was such a remedy, could the Supreme Court legally issue it?       The Court quickly answered the first two questions affirmatively. First, Marshall wrote that Marbury had a right to his commission because all appropriate procedures were followed: the commission had been properly signed and sealed. Madison contended that the commissions were void if not delivered, but the Court disagreed, and said that the delivery of the commission was merely a custom, not an essential element of the commission itself.          Because Marburys commission was valid, Marshall wrote, Madisons withholding of it was violative of a vested legal right on Marburys part.     Turning to the second question, the Court said that the laws clearly afforded Marbury a remedy. Marshall wrote that it is a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy by suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded a rule derived from the traditional Roman legal maxim ubi jus, ibi remedium , which was well established in the early  |Anglo_American_common_law|Common_Law| . In what the American legal scholar  |Akhil_Amar|Akhil_Amar|  has called one of the most important and inspiring passages of the opinion, Marshall wrote: The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws whenever he receives an injury.      Marshall then confirmed that a  |writ_of_mandamus|Writ_Of_Mandamus| a type of court order that commands a government official to perform an act he or she is legally required to performwas the proper remedy for Marburys situation. The specific issue, however, was whether a court, which was part of the judicial branch of the government, could give Marbury a remedy against Madison, who as Secretary of State was part of the executive branch of the government. The Court held that so long as the remedy involved a mandatory duty to a specific person, and not a political matter left to discretion, the courts could provide the legal remedy. In a now well-known line of the opinion that borrows a phrase John Adams had drafted in 1779 for the  |Massachusetts_State_Constitution|Constitution_Of_Massachusetts| , Marshall wrote: The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men. , quoting Marbury, 5 U.S. at 163.          This brought Marshall to the most important issue of the opinion: the propriety of the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over the matter, which would determine whether or not the Court had the power to issue the writ Marbury requested. This issue depended entirely on how the Court interpreted the text of a law Congress had passed that dealt with the Supreme Courts original and appellate jurisdictions. As Marshall explains in the opinion, under , a court has the power to be the first to hear and decide a case; under , a party to an instituted decision appeals to a higher court, which has the power to revise and correct the previous decision.     Congress had passed the  |Judiciary_Act_of_1789|Judiciary_Act_Of_1789|  to establish the American federal court system, since  |Article_III_of_the_U_S_Constitution|United_States_Constitutionarticle_Three|  only specifies that there is to be a Supreme Court, and leaves the rest of the federal judicial power to reside in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.  . The Judiciary Act contained a section that defines areas in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, and areas in which it has appellate jurisdiction.          Marbury had argued that this section gave the Supreme Court the authority to issue writs of mandamus when hearing cases under original jurisdiction, not just appellate jurisdiction. Although the language on the power to issue writs of mandamus appears with the sentence on appellate jurisdiction, rather than with the earlier sentences on original jurisdiction, a semicolon separates it from the specific clause on appellate jurisdiction. The section itself does not make clear whether the mandamus clause was intended to be read as part of the appellate sentence or on its ownin the opinion, Marshall quoted only the end of the sectionand the laws wording can plausibly be read either way. In the end, Marshall agreed with Marbury, and interpreted section 13 of the Judiciary Act to authorize mandamus on original jurisdiction.     However, Marshall then noted that this authorization clashed with Article III of the Constitution, which establishes the judicial branch of the U.S. government. Section 2 of Article III defines the nature of the Supreme Courts original and appellate jurisdiction:          This section says that the Supreme Court only has original jurisdiction over cases where a U.S. State is a party to a lawsuit or where a lawsuit involves foreign dignitaries. Neither of these categories covered Marburys justice of the peace commission, and so, according to the Constitution, the Court could only have heard Marburys case while exercising appellate jurisdiction. However, Marshall had interpreted the Judiciary Act to have given the Court original jurisdiction over the matter: this meant that the Judicial Act apparently took the initial scope of the Supreme Courts original jurisdictionwhich was limited to cases either directly involving States or involving foreign dignitariesand expanded it to include issuing writs of mandamus. Marshall ruled that Congress cannot increase the Supreme Courts original jurisdiction as it was set down in the Constitution, and therefore that the relevant portion of Section 13 of the Judiciary Act violated Article III of the Constitution.             After ruling that it conflicted with the Constitution, Marshall struck down the relevant portion of the Judiciary Act in the U.S. Supreme Courts first ever declaration of the power of  |judicial_review|Judicial_Review| . Marshall ruled that American federal courts have the power to refuse to give any effect to congressional legislation that is inconsistent with their interpretation of the Constitutiona move known as striking down laws.     The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly give the American judiciary the power of judicial review. Nevertheless, Marshalls opinion gives a number of reasons in support of the judiciarys possession of the power. First, Marshall reasoned that the written nature of the Constitution inherently established judicial review. In a line borrowed from  |Alexander_Hamiltons|Alexander_Hamilton|  essay  |Federalist_No_78|Federalist_No_78| , Marshall wrote: The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written. , quoting Marbury, 5 U.S. at 176. He continued:        Next, Marshall stated that deciding the constitutionality of the laws it applies is an inherent part of the American judiciarys role. In what has become the most famous and frequently quoted line of the opinion, Marshall wrote:      Marshall reasoned that the Constitution places limits on the American governments powers, and that those limits would be meaningless unless they were subject to judicial review and enforcement. He reasoned that the Constitutions provisions limiting Congresss powersuch as the export tax clause, or the prohibitions on  |bills_of_attainder|Bills_Of_Attainder|  and  |ex_post_facto_laws|Ex_Post_Facto_Law| meant that in some cases judges would be forced to choose between enforcing the Constitution or following Congress. In his opinion, the dilemma was not difficult: The question whether an act repugnant to the Constitution can become the law of the land is a question deeply interesting to the United States, but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. Marbury, 5 U.S. at 176, quoted in . He held virtually as a matter of iron logic that in the event of conflict between the Constitution and statutory laws passed by Congress, the constitutional law must be supreme. Again borrowing from Federalist No. 78, Marshall stated:        Third, Marshall stated that denying the supremacy of the Constitution over Congresss acts would mean that courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law. , quoting Marbury, 5 U.S. at 178. He reasoned that this, in turn, would make Congress omnipotent, since none of the laws it passed would ever be invalid:        Marshall then gave several other reasons in favor of judicial review. He argued that the authorization in Article III of the Constitution that the Court can decide cases arising under this Constitution implied that the Court had the power to strike down laws conflicting with the Constitution. This, Marshall wrote, meant that the Founders were willing to have the American judiciary use and interpret the Constitution when judging cases. He also argued that federal judges oaths of officeâ€”in which they swear to discharge their duties impartially and agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States â€”requires them to support the Constitution. Lastly, Marshall argued that judicial review is implied in  |Article_VI|Article_Six_Of_The_United_States_Constitution|  of the Constitution, since it declares the supreme law of the United States to be not the Constitution and the laws of the United States in general, but rather the Constitution and laws made in Pursuance thereof .     Marshall concluded the Courts opinion:                 Besides its inherent legal questions, the case of Marbury v. Madison also created a difficult political dilemma for Marshall and the rest of the Supreme Court. If the Court ruled in favor of Marbury and issued a writ of mandamus ordering Madison to deliver the commission, Jefferson and Madison would probably have simply ignored the order, which would have made the Court look impotent and emphasized the shakiness of the judiciary. On the other hand, a plain and simple ruling against Marbury would have given Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans a clear political victory.     Marshall avoided both problems and solved the dilemma. First, he ruled that Madisons withholding of Marburys commission was illegal, which pleased the Federalists. But then he said the Court could not give Marbury his requested writ of mandamus, which gave Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans the result they desired. At the same time, he maneuvered Marburys simple petition for a writ of mandamus into a case that presented a question that went to heart of American constitutional law itself in what the American constitutional law scholar  |Laurence_Tribe|Laurence_Tribe|  described as an oft-told tale ... remains awe-inspiring . In his well-known history of the Supreme Court, the American political historian  |Robert_G_McCloskey|Robert_G_Mccloskey|  wrote:          Marshall had been looking for a case that was suitable for introducing judicial review, and was eager to use the situation in Marbury to establish his claim. He introduced judicial reviewa move Jefferson decriedbut used it to strike down a provision of a law that he read to have expanded the Supreme Courts powers, and thereby produced Jeffersons hoped-for result of Marbury losing his case. He seized the occasion to uphold the institution of judicial review, but he did so in the course of reaching a judgment that his political opponents could neither defy nor protest.  Though Jefferson criticized Marshalls opinion, he accepted it, and Marshalls decision in Marbury articulate a role for the federal courts that survives to this day.  The American legal scholar  |Erwin_Chemerinsky|Erwin_Chemerinsky|  concluded: The brilliance of Marshalls opinion cannot be overstated.        Given its preeminent position in American constitutional law, Marshalls opinion in Marbury v. Madison continues to be the subject of critical analysis and historical inquiry. In a 1955  Harvard Law Review  article, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |Felix_Frankfurter|Felix_Frankfurter|  emphasized that one can criticize Marshalls opinion in Marbury without demeaning it: The courage of Marbury v. Madison is not minimized by suggesting that its reasoning is not impeccable and its conclusion, however wise, not inevitable.  Criticisms of Marshalls opinion in Marbury usually fall into two general categories.     First, some criticize the way Marshall strove to reach the conclusion that the U.S. Supreme Court has constitutional authority over the other branches of the U.S. government. Today, American courts generally follow the principle of constitutional avoidance : if a certain interpretation of a law raises constitutional problems, they prefer to use alternative interpretations that avoid these problems, so long as the alternative interpretations are still plausible. In Marbury, Marshall could have avoided the constitutional questions through different legal rulings: for example, if he had ruled that Marbury did not have a right to his commission until it was delivered, or if he had ruled that refusals to honor political appointments could only be remedied through the political process and not the judicial process, it would have ended the case immediately, and the Court would not have reached the cases constitutional issues. Marshall did not do so, and many legal scholars have criticized him for it. However, others have noted that the constitutional avoidance principle did not exist in 1803, and in any case is only a general guide for Court action , not an ironclad precept. Alternatively, it has also been argued that the claim that Marshall strove to create a controversy largely vanishes when the case is viewed from the legal perspective of the late 18th century, when American colonies and states supreme courts were largely modeled on the British  |Court_of_Kings_Bench|Court_Of_Kings_Bench| , which inherently possessed mandamus powers.     Second, Marshalls arguments for the Courts authority are sometimes said to be mere series of assertions , rather than substantive reasons logically laid out to support his position. It is generally agreed that Marshalls series of assertions regarding the U.S. Constitution and the actions of the other branches of government do not inexorably lead to the conclusion that Marshall draws from them.  Marshalls assertion of the American judiciarys authority to review executive branch actions was the most controversial issue when Marbury was first decided, and several subsequent U.S. presidents have tried to dispute it, to varying degrees.     Additionally, it is questionable whether Marshall should have participated in the Marbury case because of his participating role in the dispute. Marshall was still the acting Secretary of State when the nominations were made, and he himself had signed Marbury and the other mens commissions and had been responsible for their delivery. This potential conflict of interest raises strong grounds for Marshall to have recused himself from the case. In hindsight, the fact that Marshall did not recuse himself from Marbury is likely indicative of his eagerness to hear the case and use it to establish judicial review.          Marbury v. Madison remains the single most important decision in American constitutional law. It established American judges authority to review the constitutionality of Congresss legislative acts, and to this day the Supreme Courts power to review the constitutionality of American laws at both the federal and state level is generally rested upon the epic decision of Marbury v. Madison.      Although the Courts opinion in Marbury established judicial review in American federal law, it did not create or invent it. Some 18th-century British jurists had argued that British courts had the power to circumscribe  |Parliament|Parliament_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , and the principle became generally accepted in Colonial Americaespecially in Marshalls native  |Virginia|Virginia| due to the idea that in America only the people were sovereign, rather than the government, and therefore that the courts should only implement legitimate laws. By the time of the  |Constitutional_Convention|Constitutional_Convention|  in 1787, American courts independent power and duty to interpret the law was well established. Nevertheless, Marshalls opinion in Marbury was the powers first announcement and exercise by the Supreme Court. It made the practice more routine, rather than exceptional, and prepared the way for the Courts opinion in the 1819 case  McCulloch v. Maryland , in which Marshall implied that the Supreme Court was the supreme interpreter of the U.S. Constitution.     Marbury also established that the power of judicial review covers actions by  |the_executive_branch|Federal_Government_Of_The_United_Statesexecutive_Branch|  â€“ the President and his cabinet members. However, American courts power of judicial review over executive branch actions only extends to matters in which the executive has a legal duty to act or refrain from acting, and does not extend to matters that are entirely within the Presidents discretion, such as whether to veto a bill or whom to appoint to an office. This power has been the basis of many subsequent important Supreme Court decisions in American history, such as the 1974 case  United States v. Nixon , in which the Court held that President  |Richard_Nixon|Richard_Nixon|  had to comply with a  |subpoena|Subpoena|  to provide tapes of his conversations for use in a criminal trial related to the  |Watergate_scandal|Watergate_Scandal| , and which ultimately led to Nixons resignation.     Although it is a potent check on the other branches of the U.S. government, the power of judicial review was rarely exercised in early American history. After deciding Marbury in 1803, the Supreme Court did not strike down another federal law until 1857, when the Court struck down the  |Missouri_Compromise|Missouri_Compromise|  in its decision in  Dred Scott v. Sandford , a ruling that contributed to the outbreak of the  |American_Civil_War|American_Civil_War| .
