        A peace process is the set of sociopolitical negotiations, agreements and actions that aim to solve a specific armed conflict.       Prior to an armed conflict occurring, peace processes can include the prevention of an intra-state or inter-state dispute from escalating into military conflict. The  |United_Nations_Department_of_Peace_Operations|United_Nations_Department_Of_Peace_Operations|  terms the prevention of disputes from escalating into armed conflicts as conflict prevention. In 2007, the United Nations Secretary-Generals Policy Committee classed both initial prevention of an armed conflict and prevention of the repeat of a solved conflict as  |peacebuilding|Peacebuilding| .     For peace processes to resolve an armed conflict,  |Izumi_Wakugawa|Izumi_Wakugawa| , advisor to the Japan-based  |International_Peace_Cooperation_Program|International_Peace_Cooperation_Program| , suggests a definition of a peace process as a mixture of politics, diplomacy, changing relationships, negotiation, mediation, and dialogue in both official and unofficial arenas , which he attributes to  |Harold_H_Saunders|Harold_H_Saunders|  of the  |United_States_Institute_of_Peace|United_States_Institute_Of_Peace|  . Wakugawa categorises these processes into two stages: the ceasing of armed conflict and the processes of sociological reorganisation.       Non-military processes for stopping an armed conflict stage are generally classed as  |peacemaking|Peacemaking| . Military methods by globally organised military forces of stopping a local armed conflict are typically classed as  |peace_enforcement|Peace_Enforcement| .       The prevention of the repeat of a solved conflict is usually classed as  |peacebuilding|Peacebuilding| . UNDPO defines peacebuilding to include measures address core issues that effect the functioning of society and the State . The use of neutral military forces to sustain ceasefires during this phase, typically by  |United_Nations_peacekeeping_forces|List_Of_United_Nations_Peacekeeping_Missions| , can be referred to as  |peacekeeping|Peacekeeping| .       The use of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding tends to be used broadly, with overlapping phases of various peace process mechanisms.          The construction of international institutions, especially during the twentieth century, has to a large degree been motivated by the desire to provide a broad global context of peacebuilding. This includes the  |League_of_Nations|League_Of_Nations|  and the  |United_Nations|United_Nations| , and regional institutions such as the  |European_Union|European_Union| . Institutions involved in encouraging or overseeing some of the steps in specific peace processes include the  |United_Nations_Department_of_Peace_Operations|United_Nations_Department_Of_Peace_Operations| .       Many specific  |peace_mechanisms|_Category_Peace_Mechanism|  can comprise the elements of peace processes. The  |Peace_Accords_Matrix|Peace_Accords_Matrix|  of the  |Kroc_Institute_for_International_Peace_Studies|University_Of_Notre_Damegraduate_And_Professional_Schools|  at the  |University_of_Notre_Dame|University_Of_Notre_Dame| ,  |United_States|United_States| , lists some of these as  |amnesties|Amnesty| ,  |ceasefires|Ceasefire| ,  |arms_embargo|Arms_Embargo| es,  |truth_and_reconciliation_commissions|Truth_And_Reconciliation_Commission|  and reforms of the constitution, or of military, police, judicial or educational institutions or of the media. Other mechanisms include  |prisoner_exchanges|Prisoner_Exchange| ,  |confidence_building_measures|Confidence_Building_Measures| ,  |humanitarian_corridors|Humanitarian_Corridor| ,  |peace_treaties|Peace_Treaty|  and  |transitional_justice|Transitional_Justice| .       According to Neville Melvin Gertze of  |Namibia|Namibia| , speaking at an October 2019 meeting of the  |United_Nations_Security_Council|United_Nations_Security_Council| , peace agreements that are the result of negotiations including women are 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years than those which are the result of men-only negotiations. At the same meeting, United Nations Secretary-General  |António_Guterres|António_Guterres|  stated that women were excluded from peace processes, attacks against women human rights defenders had increased, and only a tiny percentage of funding for peacebuilding was given to  |womens|Womens_Rights| .
