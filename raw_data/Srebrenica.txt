During the  |Roman|Roman_Empire|  times, there was a settlement of Domavia, known to have been near a mine. Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in  |Salona|Salona|  in the southwest and  |Sirmium|Sirmium|  in the northeast using the  |Via_Argentaria|Via_Argentaria| .       In the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the  |Banate_of_Bosnia|Banate_Of_Bosnia| , and, subsequently, the  |Bosnian_Kingdom|Bosnian_Kingdom| . The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region.  By that time, a large number of merchants of the  |Republic_of_Ragusa|Republic_Of_Ragusa|  were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa . Konstantin Jireček: Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von Serbien und Bosnien während des Mittelalters: historisch-geographische Studien. Prag: Verl. der Kön. Böhmischen Ges. der Wiss., 1879 During the 14th century, many German miners moved into the area. Mihailo Dinić: Za istoriju rudarstva u srednjevekovnoj Srbiji i Bosni, S. 46 There were often armed conflicts about Srebrenica because of its mines. According to Czech historian  |Konstantin_Josef_Jireček|Konstantin_Josef_Jireček| , from 1410 to 1460, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian  |Podrinje|Podrinje|  and  |Usora|Usora|  were part of the  |Serbian_Despotate|Serbian_Despotate|  prior to the Ottoman conquest.        With the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The  |Franciscan|Franciscan|  monastery was converted into a mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area. A Short History of Bosnia, S. 53 ff.     The area of  |Osat|Osat|  was liberated for a short time during the  |First_Serbian_Uprising|First_Serbian_Uprising|  , under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasić from  |Crvica|Crvica_Srebrenica| . Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Hadži Melentije Stevanović contacted Vasić, who met with the rebel leadership. After participated in battles on the Drina , Vasić asked  |Karađorđe|Karađorđe|  for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.       During the  |Second_World_War|Second_World_War|  there were many atrocities committed by the  |Chetniks|Chetniks|  and Ustashas. Partisans fought  |Chetniks|Chetniks|  and  |Ustashe|Ustashe|  during the war and people of Srebrenica build partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.          The town of Srebrenica came to international prominence as a result of events during the  |Bosnian_War|Bosnian_War|  . The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnias other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River  |Drina|Drina|  separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs Republika Srpska.  The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the towns population.     The town and its surrounding area was surrounded and  |besieged_by_Serb_forces|Siege_Of_Srebrenica| . On 16 April 1993, the  |United_Nations|United_Nations|  declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak  |enclave|Enclave_And_Exclave|  a  |UN_safe_area|United_Nations_Safe_Areas| , to be free from any armed attack or any other hostile act , and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of  |United_Nations_Protection_Force|United_Nations_Protection_Force|  , which did nothing to defend the local population.     Srebrenica and the other UN safe areas of  |Žepa|Žepa|  and  |Goražde|Goražde|  were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the towns UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the  |Army_of_Republika_Srpska|Army_Of_Republika_Srpska| . Following the towns capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town and men below 12 years of age and above 65 were transferred by bus to  |Tuzla|Tuzla| .     The  |Srebrenica_massacre|Srebrenica_Massacre|  is considered the worst genocide in post-Second World War European history to this day.      In 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the  |International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_the_former_Yugoslavia|International_Criminal_Tribunal_For_The_Former_Yugoslavia|  to have been a crime of  |genocide|Genocide|  .  This finding was upheld in 2007 by the  |International_Court_of_Justice|International_Court_Of_Justice| . The decision of the ICTY was followed by an admission to and an apology for the massacre by the Republika Srpska government.        Under the 1995  |Dayton_Agreement|Dayton_Agreement|  which ended the Bosnian War, Srebrenica was included in the territory assigned to Bosnian Serb control as the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although guaranteed under the provisions of the Dayton Agreement, the return of survivors was repeatedly obstructed. In 2007, verbal and physical attacks on returning refugees continued to be reported in the region around Srebrenica.        In 1992, Bosniak villages around Srebrenica were under constant attacks by Serb forces. The Bosnian Institute in the United Kingdom has published a list of 296 villages destroyed by Serb forces around Srebrenica three years before the genocide and in the first three months of war : Bosnian Institute UK, the 26-page study:  , 18 November 2010.          According to the  |Naser_Orić_trial_judgement|Naser_Orićthe_Verdict|             In 2007, Srebrenicas municipal assembly adopted a resolution demanding independence from the  |Republika_Srpska|Republika_Srpska|  entity ; the Serb members of the assembly did not vote on the resolution.  In the 2016 elections Mladen Grujičić, a Bosnian Serb and native of the town of Srebrenica, was elected as the Mayor of Srebrenica.       The municipality  is further subdivided into the following local communities       |Brežani|Brežani| |_Crvica|Crvica| |_Gostilj|Gostilj| |_Kostolomci|Kostolomci| |_Luka|Luka| |_Orahovica|Orahovica| |_Osatica|Osatica| |_Radoševići|Radoševići| |_Ratkovići|Ratkovići| |_Sase|Sase_Srebrenica| |_Skelani|Skelani| |_Skenderovići|Skenderovići| |_Srebrenica|Srebrenica| |_Sućeska|Sućeska| |_Toplica|Toplica| |_Viogor|Viogor|                According to the 2013 census results, the municipality of Srebrenica has a population of 13,409 inhabitants.       ;Municipality   The borders of the municipality in the 1953 and 1961 census were different.
