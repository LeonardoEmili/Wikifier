              Sir John Major  is a British politician who served as  |prime_minister_of_the_United_Kingdom|Prime_Minister_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  and  |leader_of_the_Conservative_Party|Leader_Of_The_Conservative_Party|  from 1990 to 1997. Previously the  |foreign_secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_Foreign_And_Commonwealth_Affairs|  and then  |chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer|  in the  |Thatcher_Government|Premiership_Of_Margaret_Thatcher|  from 1989 to 1990, he was  |member_of_Parliament|Member_Of_Parliament|  for  |Huntingdon|Huntingdon|  from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  in 2013, Major has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all  |living_former_prime_ministers|Living_Prime_Ministers_Of_The_United_Kingdom| .     Born in  |St_Helier,_Surrey|St_Helier,_London| , Major grew up in  |Brixton|Brixton| . He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the  |London_Electricity_Board|London_Electricity_Board| , before becoming an executive at  |Standard_Chartered|Standard_Chartered| . He was first elected to the House of Commons at the  |1979_general_election|1979_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  as MP for  |Huntingdon|Huntingdon| . He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as  |chief_secretary_to_the_Treasury|Chief_Secretary_To_The_Treasury| , and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget.     Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War|  in March 1991, and negotiated the  |Maastricht_Treaty|Maastricht_Treaty|  in December 1991.  He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14  million votes at the  |1992_general_election|1992_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as  |Black_Wednesday|Black_Wednesday|  , his government was forced to withdraw the  |pound_sterling|Pound_Sterling|  from the  |European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism|European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism| . This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.     Despite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the  |Northern_Ireland_peace_process|Northern_Ireland_Peace_Process| , by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs . Criticism of Majors leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by  |John_Redwood|John_Redwood|  but was easily re-elected. By this time, the  |Labour_Party|Labour_Party|  had moved toward the  |centre|Centrism|  under the leadership of  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Majors government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.  Major went on to lose the  |1997_general_election|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the  |Great_Reform_Act|Reform_Act_1832|  of 1832.     Major was succeeded by  |William_Hague|William_Hague|  as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the  |2001_general_election|2001_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . In 1999, a BBC Radio 4 poll  |ranked_him_17th_of_19|Historical_Rankings_Of_Prime_Ministers_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  among 20th-century British prime ministers;  in 2016, a  |University_of_Leeds_survey|Historical_Rankings_Of_Prime_Ministers_Of_The_United_Kingdom2016_University_Of_Leeds_Survey|  ranked him 6th of 13 among post-war prime ministers.       Major was born on 29 March 1943 at  |St_Helier_Hospital_and_Queen_Marys_Hospital_for_Children|St_Helier_Hospital|  in  |St_Helier|St_Helier,_London| ,  |Surrey|Surrey| , the son of Gwen Major  and former  |music_hall|Music_Hall|  performer  |Tom_Major-Ball|Tom_Major-Ball|  , who was sixty-three years old when Major was born.  He was christened John Roy Major but only John Major was recorded on his  |birth_certificate|Birth_Certificate| .  He used his middle name until the early 1980s.  Major grew up in Longfellow Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, where he attended primary school at Cheam Common and from 1954, he attended  |Rutlish_School|Rutlish_School| , a  |grammar_school|Grammar_School|  in the  |London_Borough_of_Merton|London_Borough_Of_Merton| .     In 1955, with his fathers garden ornaments business in decline, the family moved to  |Brixton|Brixton| . The following year, Major watched his first debate in the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , where  |Harold_Macmillan|Harold_Macmillan|  presented his only Budget as  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| , and has attributed his political ambitions to that event. He also credited a chance meeting with former Prime Minister  |Clement_Attlee|Clement_Attlee|  on the  |Kings_Road|Kings_Road|  shortly afterwards.      Major left school just before his 16th birthday in 1959 with three  |O-levels|General_Certificate_Of_Education|  in History, English Language and English Literature. He later gained three more O-levels by  |correspondence_course|Distance_Education| , in the  |British_Constitution|Constitution_Of_The_United_Kingdom| , Mathematics and Economics.      Majors first job was as a clerk in the London-based insurance brokerage firm Pratt & Sons in 1959. Disliking this job, he resigned. Major joined the  |Young_Conservatives|Young_Conservatives|  in Brixton at this time.  Major was almost nineteen years old when his father died, at the age of 82 on 27 March 1962. His mother died eight years later in September 1970, at the age of 65. GRO Register of Births: JUN 1905 7a 741 GAINSBRO  – Gwendoline Minnie Coates, mmn unknown. GRO Register of Deaths: SEP 1970 5a 1807 CROYDON  – Gwendoline Minnie Major, DoB about 1905.     After Major became Prime Minister, it was misreported that his failure to get a job as a bus conductor resulted from his failing to pass a maths test. He had in fact passed all of the necessary tests but had been passed over owing to his height.     After a period of unemployment, Major started working at the  |London_Electricity_Board|London_Electricity_Board|  in 1963 which is where incidentally his successor as Prime Minister,  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair| , also worked when he was young. He later decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the  |Standard_Chartered_Bank|Standard_Chartered_Bank|  in May 1965 and he rose quickly through the ranks. He was sent to work in  |Jos,_Nigeria|Jos,_Nigeria| , by the bank in 1967 and he nearly died in a car accident there.        Major was interested in politics from an early age. Encouraged by fellow Conservative Derek Stone, he started giving speeches on a  |soap-box|Soapbox|  in  |Brixton_Market|Brixton_Market| . He stood as a candidate for  |Lambeth_London_Borough_Council|Lambeth_London_Borough_Council|  at the age of 21 in 1964, and was elected in the Conservative landslide in 1968. While on the Council he was Chairman of the Housing Committee, being responsible for overseeing the building of several large  |council_housing|Council_Housing|  estates. He lost his seat in 1971.      Major was an active  |Young_Conservative|Young_Conservatives| , and according to his biographer  |Anthony_Seldon|Anthony_Seldon|  brought youthful exuberance to the Tories in Brixton, but was often in trouble with the professional agent Marion Standing. Also according to Seldon, the formative political influence on Major was Jean Kierans, a divorcée 13 years his elder, who became his political mentor and his lover, too. Seldon writes She  ... made Major smarten his appearance, groomed him politically, and made him more ambitious and worldly. Their relationship lasted from 1963 to sometime after 1968.      Major stood for election to  |Parliament|Parliament_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in  |St_Pancras_North|St_Pancras_North|  in general elections in  |February|February_1974_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  and  |October_1974|October_1974_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , but was unsuccessful each time. In November 1976, Major was selected to be the candidate for the safe Conservative seat of  |Huntingdonshire|Huntingdonshire| . He won the seat in the  |1979_general_election|1979_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . Following boundary changes, Major became the MP for the newly formed seat of  |Huntingdon|Huntingdon|  in  |1983|1983_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , and retained the seat in  |1987|1987_United_Kingdom_General_Election| ,  |1992|1992_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  and  |1997|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election| . He retired from Parliament in  |2001|2001_United_Kingdom_General_Election| .     He was appointed as a  |Parliamentary_Private_Secretary|Parliamentary_Private_Secretary|  in January 1981, becoming an  |assistant_whip|Whip|  in 1983. He was later made  |Under-Secretary_of_State|Parliamentary_Under-Secretary_Of_State|  for  |Social_Security|Department_For_Work_And_Pensions|  in 1985, before being promoted to become  |Minister_of_State|Minister_Of_State|  in the same department in September 1986, first attracting national media attention over  |cold_weather_payments|Cold_Weather_Payment|  to the elderly in January 1987, when Britain was in the depths of a severe winter.            Following the  |1987_election|1987_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , Major was promoted to the  |Cabinet|Cabinet_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  as  |Chief_Secretary_to_the_Treasury|Chief_Secretary_To_The_Treasury| . Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded  |Geoffrey_Howe|Geoffrey_Howe|  as  |Foreign_Secretary|Secretary_Of_State_For_Foreign_And_Commonwealth_Affairs| . The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Majors relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer|  after the sudden resignation of  |Nigel_Lawson|Nigel_Lawson| . This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the  |Great_Offices_of_State|Great_Offices_Of_State| .     As Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as a budget for savings and announced the  |Tax-Exempt_Special_Savings_Account|Tax-Exempt_Special_Savings_Account|  , arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household  |savings_ratio|Savings_Ratio|  that had been apparent during the previous  |financial_year|Fiscal_Year| . In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a hard  |ecu|Wikt:Ecu|  , competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and  |Douglas_Hurd|Douglas_Hurd| , Majors successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the  |European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism|European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism| , a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson. Edmund Dell, The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945–90 , pp. 541–50.     After  |Michael_Heseltine|Michael_Heseltine|  challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party  |in_November_1990|1990_Conservative_Party_Leadership_Election| , Major and  |Douglas_Hurd|Douglas_Hurd|  were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatchers nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign – it later emerged that he had signed both Thatchers papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.     Unlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both  |Douglas_Hurd|Douglas_Hurd|  and  |Michael_Heseltine|Michael_Heseltine|  to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since  |Stanley_Baldwin|Stanley_Baldwin|  .                          The UK economy entered a recession during 1990, which deepened in 1991, with unemployment rising rapidly. The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first  |Gulf_War|Gulf_War| , playing a key role in persuading  |US_President|President_Of_The_United_States| |George_H._W._Bush|George_H._W._Bush|  to support  |no-fly_zones|No-Fly_Zone| . During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an  |IRA|Irish_Republican_Army|  assassination attempt by  |mortar_attack|Downing_Street_Mortar_Attack| . The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since  |Harold_Macmillan|Harold_Macmillan|  in the early 1960s. , BBC News, 28 September 2002.     In spite of  |Labour_Leader|Labour_Party| |Neil_Kinnocks|Neil_Kinnock|  repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasnt until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned  |soapbox|Soapbox|  as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Partys seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting  |negative_campaign|Negative_Campaigning|  advertising focusing on the issue of Labours approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win – or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a  |hung_parliament|Hung_Parliament|  or a small Labour majority, with Majors best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.      Despite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14  million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons , this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.          Majors second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the  |Exchange_Rate_Mechanism|Exchange_Rate_Mechanism|  in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as Black Wednesday , with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the days events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.       Although Major continued to defend Britains membership of the ERM, stating that the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment , the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Governments economic credibility irreparably damaged. Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking  |Norman_Lamont|Norman_Lamont|  as  |Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer|Chancellor_Of_The_Exchequer| , replacing him with  |Kenneth_Clarke|Kenneth_Clarke| . This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in  |Newbury|Newbury,_Berkshire| . His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Majors critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.      Within a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the  |Maastricht|Maastricht_Treaty|  dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.  The UKs forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible  |exchange_rates|Exchange_Rate| , allowing lower  |interest_rates|Interest_Rate|  and  |devaluation|Devaluation| , thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7 million.         On becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain at the very heart of Europe , and claimed to have won game, set and match for Britain – by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the  |Maastricht_Treaty|Maastricht_Treaty| , and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a Federal Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate pillars from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britains non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.     Even these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the  |Eurosceptic|Euroscepticism|  wing of Majors party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the  |Maastricht_Rebels|Maastricht_Rebels| , voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a  |vote_of_confidence|1993_Vote_Of_Confidence_In_The_Major_Ministry| . He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.     Later that day, Major gave an interview to  |ITNs|Itn| |Michael_Brunson|Michael_Brunson| . During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18  ... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? Whats  |Lyndon_B._Johnsons|Lyndon_B._Johnson|  maxim? The maxim referred to is Johnsons comment about  |J._Edgar_Hoover|J._Edgar_Hoover| |Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation|Federal_Bureau_Of_Investigation|  , but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoovers presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in . Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities , but many journalists suggested that the three were  |Peter_Lilley|Peter_Lilley| ,  |Michael_Portillo|Michael_Portillo|  and  |Michael_Howard|Michael_Howard| , three of the more prominent  |Eurosceptics|Euroscepticism|  within his Cabinet.  Throughout the rest of Majors time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with  |John_Redwoods|John_Redwood|  name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the  Daily Mirror  and widely reported, embarrassing Major.     By April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Majors popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his partys dismal showings in the opinion polls, Majors own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his consensus approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  – while others were keen to point out that Majors conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister,  |Anthony_Eden|Anthony_Eden|  – who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.     Arguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician  |Jean-Luc_Dehaene|Jean-Luc_Dehaene|  to succeed  |Jacques_Delors|Jacques_Delors|  as  |President_of_the_European_Commission|President_Of_The_European_Commission|  for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views,  |Jacques_Santer|Jacques_Santer| , instead. Around this time Major – who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader  |John_Smith|John_Smith|  as Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels – tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union . After Major had to back down on this issue  |Tony_Marlow|Tony_Marlow|  called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with  |mad_cow_disease|Mad_Cow_Disease|  – the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the  |Beef_war|Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathythe_Ban_On_British_Beef| . By April 2013,  |vCJD|Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathyepidemiology|  – the human form of the disease had killed 280 people .     For the rest of Majors premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor  |Ken_Clarke|Ken_Clarke| , favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire  |Sir_James_Goldsmith|James_Goldsmith|  had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.       Majors premiership saw the ongoing war in  |Bosnia|Bosnia| . Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Governments reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a level killing field and that air strikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The  |Clinton_administration|Presidency_Of_Bill_Clinton| , by contrast, was committed to a policy of lift and strike causing tensions in the special relationship .        Some commentators compared the Major Governments policy to amoral equivalency because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.  To some extent, these critics of Majors policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary  |Malcolm_Rifkind|Malcolm_Rifkind|  accepted that the arms embargo was a serious mistake by the UN.        Major opened talks with the  |Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army|Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army|  upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that to sit down and talk with  |Mr_Adams|Gerry_Adams|  and the Provisional IRA  ... would turn my stomach ,   |Sinn_Féin|Sinn_Féin|  gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The  |Downing_Street_Declaration|Downing_Street_Declaration|  was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and  |Albert_Reynolds|Albert_Reynolds| , the Irish  |Taoiseach|Taoiseach| , with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the  |Mitchell|George_J._Mitchell|  Principles , which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, which was signed after he left office.    In March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President  |Bill_Clinton|Bill_Clinton|  for several days because of his anger at Clintons decision to invite Gerry Adams to the  |White_House|White_House|  for  |St_Patricks_Day|Saint_Patricks_Day| .        From 1994 to 1997, Major  |privatised_British_Rail|Privatisation_Of_British_Rail| , splitting it up into  |franchises_to_be_run_by_the_private_sector|Passenger_Rail_Franchising_In_Great_Britain| .  The process was controversial at the time, and the  |effect_of_privatising_the_railway|Impact_Of_The_Privatisation_Of_British_Rail|  is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy   and concern about foreign companies running British railways.        At the 1993  |Conservative_Party|Conservative_Party|  Conference, Major began the  |Back_to_Basics|Back_To_Basics|  campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many purely in the context of returning to the moral and  |family_values|Family_Values|  that they associated with the Conservative Party.     Instead of being well received, Back to Basics instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by  |tabloid_newspapers|Tabloid|  such as  The Sun . In 1992,  |David_Mellor|David_Mellor| , a cabinet minister, had been exposed as having an extramarital affair and for accepting hospitality from the daughter of a leading member of the  |Palestine_Liberation_Organization|Palestine_Liberation_Organization| . The wife of  |Lord_Caithness|Malcolm_Sinclair,_20Th_Earl_Of_Caithness|  committed suicide amongst rumours of the peer committing adultery.  |Stephen_Milligan|Stephen_Milligan|  was found dead having apparently auto-asphyxiated whilst performing a solitary sex act .  |David_Ashby|David_Ashby|  was  |outed|Outing|  by his wife after sleeping with men. A string of other Conservative MPs, including  |Alan_Amos|Alan_Amos| ,  |Tim_Yeo|Tim_Yeo| , and  |Michael_Brown|Michael_Brown| , were involved in sexual scandals.     Other debilitating scandals included Arms to Iraq – the ongoing inquiry into how government ministers including  |Alan_Clark|Alan_Clark|  had encouraged businesses to supply arms to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, in breach of the official arms embargo, and how senior ministers had, on legal advice, attempted to withhold evidence of this official connivance when directors of Matrix Churchill were put on trial for breaking the embargo.     Another scandal was  |Cash_for_Questions|Cash_For_Questions|  , in which first  |Graham_Riddick|Graham_Riddick| , and  |David_Tredinnick|David_Tredinnick|  accepted money to ask questions in the  |House_of_Commons|House_Of_Commons_Of_The_United_Kingdom|  in a newspaper sting , and later  |Tim_Smith|Tim_Smith|  and  |Neil_Hamilton|Neil_Hamilton|  were found to have received money from  |Mohamed_Al-Fayed|Mohamed_Al-Fayed| , also to ask questions in the  |House|British_House_Of_Commons| . Later,  |David_Willetts|David_Willetts|  resigned as  |Paymaster_General|Paymaster_General|  after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with Cash for Questions.     Defence Minister  |Jonathan_Aitken|Jonathan_Aitken|  was accused by the  |ITV|Itv| |investigative_journalism|Investigative_Journalism|  series  World in Action  and  The Guardian  newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the sword of truth in libel proceedings which he brought against The Guardian and the producers of World in Action  |Granada_Television|Granada_Television| . At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.     Major attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries – the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.     Although  |Tim_Smith|Tim_Smith|  stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamiltons case by the former BBC Reporter  |Martin_Bell|Martin_Bell| , who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.     Major later commented in his memoirs on the routine with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue fed the public belief that the Conservative  ... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits and quoted Labours claim in 1997: Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.        On 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting  |leadership_election|1995_Conservative_Party_Leadership_Election|  – he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority.  |John_Redwood|John_Redwood|  resigned as  |Secretary_of_State_for_Wales|Secretary_Of_State_For_Wales|  to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwoods 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight active abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.      The Sun  newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline Redwood versus Deadwood .        Majors comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the partys policies with slogans like New Labour, New Danger . He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, in order to delay the publication of a report into the Cash for Questions scandal.      Unfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even  The Sun  newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for  |Tony_Blairs|Tony_Blair|  New Labour , condemning the Tories as tired, divided and rudderless .     On 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the  |worst_electoral_defeat|1997_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  by a ruling party since the  |Reform_Act_1832|Reform_Act_1832| . In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until  |2010|2010_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , and did not win a parliamentary majority until  |2015|2015_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , which only lasted two years.     The following day Major travelled to  |Buckingham_Palace|Buckingham_Palace|  to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside  |10_Downing_Street|10_Downing_Street|  in which he said; When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage—and that is what I propose to do.  Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to  |The_Oval|The_Oval|  to watch  |Surrey|Surrey_County_Cricket_Club|  play cricket.       Although many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn.  |Lord_Cranborne|Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_7Th_Marquess_Of_Salisbury| , his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip,  |Alastair_Goodlad|Alastair_Goodlad| , both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor. Major refused, saying: It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.      Major served as  |Leader_of_the_Opposition|Leader_Of_The_Opposition|  for seven weeks while the  |leadership_election|1997_Conservative_Party_Leadership_Election|  to replace him was underway. He formed  |a_temporary_Shadow_Cabinet|Shadow_Cabinet_Of_John_Major| , but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs. Major himself served as  |Shadow_Foreign_Secretary|Shadow_Foreign_Secretary|  and  |Shadow_Secretary_of_State_for_Defence|Shadow_Secretary_Of_State_For_Defence| , and the office of  |Shadow_Scotland_Secretary|Shadow_Secretary_Of_State_For_Scotland|  was left vacant until after the  |2001_general_election|2001_United_Kingdom_General_Election|  as the party had no MPs from Scotland. Majors resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of  |William_Hague|William_Hague| . His  |Resignation_Honours|1997_Prime_Ministers_Resignation_Honours|  were announced in August 1997.     Major remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates. He stood down from the House of Commons at the  |2001_general_election|2001_United_Kingdom_General_Election| , having announced his retirement live on  |BBC_Ones|Bbc_One|  breakfast television show with  |David_Frost|David_Frost|  in October 2000.           Majors mild-mannered style and moderate political stance contrasted with that of Thatcher, and made him theoretically well-placed to act as a conciliatory and relatively uncontroversial leader of his party. In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britains integration with the  |European_Union|European_Union| . Major never succeeded in reconciling the Euro-rebels among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by  |Bill_Cash|Bill_Cash|  and  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which  |Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret_Thatcher|  had been deposed did not make Majors task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of  |Tony_Blair|Tony_Blair|  as  |Labour_leader|Labour_Party|  in July 1994.      Major defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990–1992. He wrote that, During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75  million when I took office, and at 1.6  million and falling upon my departure; and the governments annual borrowing rose from  |£|Pound_Sterling| 0.5  billion to nearly £46  billion at its peak before falling to £1  billion .  |Ken_Clarke|Kenneth_Clarke|  stated in 2016 that Majors reputation looked better as time went by, in the same way that  |Tony_Blairs|Tony_Blair|  legacy appeared to be in decline.      The former Labour MP  |Tony_Banks|Tony_Banks,_Baron_Stratford|  said of Major in 1994 that, He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council. Every time he gets up now I keep thinking, What on earth is Councillor Major doing? I cant believe hes here and sometimes I think he cant either.   |Paddy_Ashdown|Paddy_Ashdown| , the Leader of the  |Liberal_Democrats|Liberal_Democrats|  during Majors term of office, once described him in the House of Commons as a decent and honourable man . Few observers doubted that he was an honest man, or that he made sincere and sometimes successful attempts to improve life in Britain and to unite his deeply divided party. He was also perceived as a weak and ineffectual figure, and his approval ratings for most of his time in office were low, particularly after  |Black_Wednesday|Black_Wednesday|  in September 1992.  Conversely on occasions he attracted criticism for pursuing schemes favoured by the right of his party, notably the  |privatisation_of_British_Rail|Impact_Of_The_Privatisation_Of_British_Rail| .        Since leaving office, Major has maintained a low profile, indulging his love of cricket as President of  |Surrey_County_Cricket_Club|Surrey_County_Cricket_Club|  until 2002  and commentating on political developments in the manner of an elder statesman.  He has been a member of  |the_Carlyle_Groups|The_Carlyle_Group|  European Advisory Board since 1998 and was appointed Chairman of Carlyle Europe in May 2001.  He stood down in August 2004.     Like some post-war former Prime Ministers , Major turned down a peerage when he retired from the House of Commons in 2001. He said that he wanted a firebreak from politics and to focus on writing and his business, sporting and charity work.  He now supports a number of charities, including sight loss and learning disability charity  |SeeAbility|Seeability| , for whom he has acted as Vice President since 2013.      In March 2001, he gave the tribute to  |Colin_Cowdrey|Colin_Cowdrey|  at his memorial service in  |Westminster_Abbey|Westminster_Abbey| .  In 2005, he was elected to the Committee of the  |Marylebone_Cricket_Club|Marylebone_Cricket_Club|  , historically the governing body of the sport, and still guardian of the laws of the game.  Following the death of  |Diana,_Princess_of_Wales|Diana,_Princess_Of_Wales| , in 1997, Major was appointed a special guardian to Princes  |William|Prince_William,_Duke_Of_Cambridge|  and  |Harry|Prince_Harry| ,  with responsibility for legal and administrative matters. As a result of this, Major was the only current or former Prime Minister out of the five still alive invited to the  |wedding_of_Prince_Harry_and_Meghan_Markle|Wedding_Of_Prince_Harry_And_Meghan_Markle|  in May 2018.     An  |oil_painting|Oil_Painting|  of Major, painted in 1996 by  |June_Mendoza|June_Mendoza| , is part of the parliamentary collection,  as is a bronze bust by  |Anne_Curry|Anne_Curry| .      Major is the author of three books:   John Major: The Autobiography More than a Game, a history of cricket   My Old Man, a history of Music Hall       Majors low profile following his exit from parliament was disrupted by  |Edwina_Curries|Edwina_Currie|  revelation in September 2002 that, prior to his promotion to the Cabinet, he had had a four-year  |extramarital_affair|Extramarital_Affair|  with her.   Commentators were quick to refer to Majors previous Back to Basics platform to throw charges of hypocrisy, and an obituary of  |Tony_Newton|Tony_Newton,_Baron_Newton_Of_Braintree|  in  The Daily Telegraph  claimed that if Newton had not kept the affair a closely guarded secret it is highly unlikely that Major would have become prime minister .      In 1993, Major had also sued two magazines,  New Statesman and Society  and  Scallywag , as well as their distributors, for reporting rumours of an affair with a caterer, even though at least one of the magazines had said that the rumours were false. Both considered legal action to recover their costs when the affair with Currie was revealed.      In a press statement, Major said that he was ashamed by the affair and that his wife had forgiven him. In response, Currie said he wasnt ashamed of it at the time and he wanted it to continue.        In February 2005, it was reported that Major and  |Norman_Lamont|Norman_Lamont|  delayed the release of papers on  |Black_Wednesday|Black_Wednesday|  under the  |Freedom_of_Information_Act|Freedom_Of_Information_Act_2000| .  Major denied doing so, saying that he had not heard of the request until the scheduled release date and had merely asked to look at the papers himself. He told  |BBC_News|Bbc_News|  that he and Lamont had been the victims of whispering voices to the press.  He later publicly approved the release of the papers.      Major has become an active after-dinner speaker. He earns over £25,000 per engagement for his insights and his own opinions according to his agency.      In December 2006, Major led calls for an independent inquiry into  |Tony_Blairs|Tony_Blair|  decision to  |invade_Iraq|2003_Invasion_Of_Iraq| , following revelations made by  |Carne_Ross|Carne_Ross| , a former British senior diplomat, that contradict Blairs case for the invasion.  He was touted as a possible Conservative candidate for the  |Mayor_of_London_elections_in_2008|2008_London_Mayoral_Election| , but turned down an offer from Conservative leader  |David_Cameron|David_Cameron| . A spokesperson for Major said his political career is behind him .      In 2010, Major became a key loyalist to the  |Cameron–Clegg_coalition|Cameron–Clegg_Coalition| , and stated that he hoped for a  |liberal_conservative|Liberal_Conservative|  alliance beyond 2015, and criticised  |Ed_Miliband|Ed_Miliband|  and Labour for party games rather than helping in the national interest.         In February 2012, Major became chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.  The trust was formed as part of the  |Diamond_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II|Diamond_Jubilee_Of_Elizabeth_Ii| , and is intended to support charitable organisations and projects across the  |Commonwealth_of_Nations|Commonwealth_Of_Nations| , focusing on areas such as cures for diseases and the promotion of culture and education. Later on in 2012, John Major became President of influential centre-right think tank the  |Bow_Group|Bow_Group| .      He is currently a president of the  |Chatham_House|Chatham_House|  think tank . Retrieved 29 September 2012. and advises  |Credit_Suisse|Credit_Suisse| .      John Major supports a  |second_referendum|Proposed_Referendum_On_The_Brexit_Withdrawal_Agreement|  over  |Brexit|Brexit| . He said that the leave campaign put out a fantasy case during the  |2016_referendum|2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_Membership_Referendum| , to describe a second vote as undemocratic was a rather curious proposition and he could see no intellectual argument against redoing the ballot.  Major fears Brexit will make the UK poorer and border problems in Ireland could endanger peace there.      On 21 April 2018, he attended the funeral of former US First Lady  |Barbara_Bush|Barbara_Bush|  at  |St._Martins_Episcopal_Church|St._Martins_Episcopal_Church|  in  |Houston,_Texas|Houston,_Texas| . On 5 December, he also attended the  |state_funeral|Death_And_State_Funeral_Of_George_H._W._Bush|  of former US President  |George_H._W._Bush|George_H._W._Bush| .     On 30 August 2019, it was announced by diverse media that Major intended to join  |a_court_case_by_Gina_Miller|R_V_The_Prime_Minister_And_Cherry_V_Advocate_General_For_Scotland|  against the  |proroguing_of_Parliament|2019_British_Prorogation_Controversy|  by the Prime Minister,  |Boris_Johnson|Boris_Johnson| .        During his leadership of the Conservative Party, Major was portrayed as honest but unable to rein in the philandering and bickering within his party. Majors appearance was noted in its greyness, his prodigious  |philtrum|Philtrum| , and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in  Spitting Image , Majors puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying nice peas, dear , while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague  |Virginia_Bottomley|Virginia_Bottomley|  – an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with  |Edwina_Currie|Edwina_Currie| , which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring oh dear .     The media  used the allegation by  |Alastair_Campbell|Alastair_Campbell|  that he had observed Major tucking his shirt into his underpants to  |caricature|Caricature|  him wearing his pants outside his trousers,  as a pale grey echo of both  |Superman|Superman|  and  |Supermac|Supermac| , a parody of  |Harold_Macmillan|Harold_Macmillan| . Bell also used the humorous possibilities of the  |Cones_Hotline|Cones_Hotline| , a means for the public to inform the authorities of potentially unnecessary  |traffic_cones|Traffic_Cone| , which was part of the  |Citizens_Charter|Citizens_Charter|  project established by John Major.      Private Eye  parodied  |Sue_Townsends|Sue_Townsend|  The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole , age 13¾ to write  The Secret Diary of John Major, age 47¾ , in which Major was portrayed as naïve and childish, keeping lists of his enemies in a Rymans Notebook called his Bastards Book , and featuring my wife  |Norman|Norma_Major|  and  |Mr_Dr_Mawhinney|Brian_Mawhinney,_Baron_Mawhinney|  as  |recurring_characters|Recurring_Character| . The magazine still runs one-off specials of this diary on occasions when Major is in the news, such as on the breaking of the Edwina Currie story or the publication of his autobiography. The magazine also ran a series of cartoons called 101 Uses for a John Major , in which Major was illustrated serving a number of bizarre purposes, such as a train-spotters anorak.      Majors Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Partys 1992 election campaign: What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.      Major was often mocked for his nostalgic evocation of what sounded like the lost Britain of the 1950s . For example: Fifty years on from now, Britain will still be the country of long shadows on cricket grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers . Page 370, Major: A political life by  |Anthony_Seldon|Anthony_Seldon| , Weidenfeld 1997. Major complained in his memoirs that these words   had been misrepresented as being more naive and romantic than he had intended, and indeed his memoirs were dismissive of the common conservative viewpoint that there was once a time of moral rectitude; Major wrote that life has never been as simple as that .     Writing in 2011 the BBCs Home editor  |Mark_Easton|Mark_Easton|  judged that Majorism had made little lasting impact.   |Peter_Oborne|Peter_Oborne| , writing in 2012, asserts that Majors government looks ever more successful as time goes by.  Major was also one of the prime ministers portrayed in the 2013 stage play  The Audience , played by  |Paul_Ritter|Paul_Ritter| .         |Member_of_Her_Majestys_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council|Her_Majestys_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council| |Member_of_the_Order_of_the_Companions_of_Honour|Order_Of_The_Companions_Of_Honour| |Knight_Companion_of_the_Most_Noble_Order_of_the_Garter|Order_Of_The_Garter|      In the 1999 New Year Honours List, Major was made a  |Companion_of_Honour|Order_Of_The_Companions_Of_Honour|  for his work on the  |Northern_Ireland_peace_process|Northern_Ireland_Peace_Process| .  In a 2003 interview, he spoke about his hopes for peace in the region.      On 23 April 2005, Major was bestowed with a knighthood as a  |Companion_of_the_Order_of_the_Garter|Order_Of_The_Garter|  by  |Queen_Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth_Ii| . He was installed at  |St_Georges_Chapel|St_Georges_Chapel,_Windsor_Castle| ,  |Windsor|Windsor,_Berkshire|  on 13 June. Membership of the  |Order_of_the_Garter|Order_Of_The_Garter|  is limited in number to 24, and as a personal gift of the Queen is an honour traditionally bestowed on former Prime Ministers.  Major had previously declined a  |life_peer|Life_Peer| age on standing down from  |Parliament|British_House_Of_Commons| .  – accessed 15 August 2006.     On 20 June 2008, Major was granted the Freedom of the  |City_of_Cork|Cork| .      On 26 April 2010, Major gave a speech in the  |Cambridge_Union|Cambridge_Union_Society| , after which he was granted honorary membership of the society.      On 8 May 2012, Major was personally decorated at the  |Imperial_Palace|Tokyo_Imperial_Palace|  in  |Tokyo|Tokyo|  by the  |Emperor_of_Japan|Emperor_Of_Japan|  with the Grand Cordon of the  |Order_of_the_Rising_Sun|Order_Of_The_Rising_Sun|  in recognition of his invaluable contributions to  |Japan–UK_relations|Japan–United_Kingdom_Relations|  through his work in the political and economic arena, and also in promoting mutual understanding. While Prime Minister, Major had pursued energetic campaigns aimed at boosting bilateral trade: Priority Japan and Action Japan . The 1991 Japan Festival also took place under his premiership.        2008  |British_Sports_Book_Awards|British_Sports_Book_Awards|  , More Than a Game           Major married Norma Johnson  on 3 October 1970 at  |St_Matthews_Church,_Brixton|St_Matthews_Church,_Brixton| .  She was a teacher and a member of the Young Conservatives. They met on  |polling_day|Election_Day|  for the  |Greater_London_Council|Greater_London_Council|  elections in London, and became engaged after only ten days.  They had two children; a son, James, and a daughter, Elizabeth. They have a holiday home on the coast of north  |Norfolk|Norfolk| , near  |Weybourne|Weybourne,_Norfolk| , which has round-the-clock police surveillance.      Majors elder brother,  |Terry|Terry_Major-Ball| , who died in 2007, became a minor media personality during Majors period in Downing Street, with a 1994 autobiography, Major Major. He also wrote newspaper columns, and appeared on TV shows such as  Have I Got News for You . He faced criticism about his brother but always remained loyal.     Sir Johns daughter Elizabeth married Luke Salter on 26 March 2000,  having been in a relationship since 1988.  Salter died on 22 November 2002 from cancer.      His son James, a former nightclub promoter and flooring contractor, married gameshow hostess  |Emma_Noble|Emma_Noble|  and they have a son, Harrison. Following their divorce, James married Kate Postlethwaite , the mother of his second son, on 31 March 2012.
