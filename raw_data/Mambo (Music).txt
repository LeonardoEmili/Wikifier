      Mambo is a genre of Cuban dance music pioneered by the  |charanga|Charanga| |Arcaño_y_sus_Maravillas|Arcaño_Y_Sus_Maravillas|  in the late 1930s and later popularized in the  |big_band|Big_Band|  style by  |Pérez_Prado|Pérez_Prado| . It originated as a syncopated form of the  |danzón|Danzón| , known as  |danzón-mambo|Danzón-Mambo| , with a final, improvised section, which incorporated the  guajeo s typical of  |son_cubano|Son_Cubano|  . These guajeos became the essence of the genre when it was played by big bands, which did not perform the traditional sections of the danzón and instead leaned towards  |swing|Swing_Music|  and  |jazz|Jazz| . By the late 1940s and early 1950s, mambo had become a dance craze in the  |United_States|United_States|  as its  |associated_dance|Mambo|  took over the East Coast thanks to Pérez Prado,  |Tito_Puente|Tito_Puente| ,  |Tito_Rodríguez|Tito_Rodríguez|  and others. In the mid-1950s, a slower ballroom style, also derived from the danzón,  |cha-cha-cha|Cha-Cha-Cha| , replaced mambo as the most popular dance genre in North America. Nonetheless, mambo continued to enjoy some degree of popularity into the 1960s and new derivative styles appeared, such as dengue; by the 1970s it had been largely incorporated into  |salsa|Salsa_Music| .            The earliest roots of mambo can be traced to the  danzón de nuevo ritmo  , later known as danzón-mambo, made popular by the orchestra  |Arcaño_y_sus_Maravillas|Arcaño_Y_Sus_Maravillas|  conducted by flautist  |Antonio_hi|Antonio_Arcaño| |Orestes_López|Orestes_López|  and his brother  |Israel_López_Cachao|Cachao| , main composers of the Maravillas, were the first to denominate a final upbeat, improvised section of the popular Cuban  |danzón|Danzón|  as a mambo. This innovation a key step in the process of evolution of the danzón, which over the years had progressively lost its structural rigidity to the benefit of musicians and dancers alike. Prior to the danzón de nuevo ritmo, in 1910,  |José_Urfé|José_Urfé|  had first added a  |montuno|Montuno|   as a final part of his composition El bombín de Barreto. This was a swinging section consisting of a repeated musical phrase, which introduced some elements of the  |son|Son|  into the  |danzón|Danzón| . During the mid-to-late 1930s, some members of the Arcaño group were saying vamos a mambear when referring to the  |montuno|Montuno|  or final improvisation of the  |danzón|Danzón| . Sublette, Ned.

Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2004: 508 It was Arcaños cellist,  |Orestes_López|Orestes_López| , who created the first  |danzón|Danzón|  called  |Mambo|Mambo|  .  In this piece, some syncopated motives taken from the son style were combined with improvised flute passages. Orovio, p. 130.     Antonio Arcaño described the mambo as follows: Mambo is a type of syncopated  montuno  that possesses the rhythmic charm, informality and eloquence of the Cuban people. The pianist attacks the mambo, the flute picks it up and improvises, the violin executes rhythmic chords in double stops, the double bass inserts a tumbao, the timbalero plays the cowbell, the güiro scrapes and plays the maracas rhythm, the indispensable tumba  reaffirms the bass tumbao and strengthens the timbal.

In 1949 he traveled to Mexico looking for job opportunities and achieved great success with a new style, to which he assigned a name that had been already used by  |Antonio_Arcaño|Antonio_Arcaño| , the mambo. Díaz Ayala, Cristóbal: Música cubana, del Areyto a la Nueva Trova, Ediciones Universal, Miami Florida, 1993. p. 194.     Perez Prados style differed from the previous mambo concept. The new style possessed a greater influence from North-American  |jazz|Jazz_Music| , and an expanded instrumentation consisting of four to five trumpets, four to five saxophones, double bass, drums, maracas, cowbell, congas and bongoes. This new mambo included a catchy counterpoint between the trumpets and the saxophones that induced the body to move along with the rhythm, stimulated at the end of each musical phrase by a characteristic deep throat sound expression.     Because his music was aimed at an audience that lived primarily outside Cuba, Pérez Prado used a large number of international influences, especially North-American, in his arrangements. This is evident in his arrangements of songs such as Mambo Rock , Patricia and Tequila , where he uses a triple meter U.S. swing rhythm fused with elements from  |Cuban_rumba|Cuban_Rumba|  and  |son|Son| . Pérez Prados repertoire included numerous international pieces such as Cerezo Rosa , María Bonita , Tea For Two , La Bikina ,  |Cuando_Calienta_El_Sol|Cuando_Calienta_El_Sol|  ,  |Malagueña|Malagueña|  and En Un Pueblito Español , among many others.

Famous Cuban singer  |Beny_Moré|Beny_Moré|  also lived in Mexico between 1945 and 1952  . He composed and recorded some mambos there with Mexican orchestras, especially the one led by Rafael de Paz; they recorded Yiri Yiri Bon , La Culebra , Mata Siguaraya ,  |Solamente_Una_Vez|Solamente_Una_Vez|  and Bonito Y Sabroso  . Benny and Perez Prado recorded 28 mambo songs including La Múcura , Rabo Y Oreja , and Pachito Eché  . At this time Benny also recorded with the orchestra of Jesús Chucho Rodríguez.     Prados recordings were meant for the Latin American and U.S. latino markets, but some of his most celebrated mambos, such as Mambo No. 5 and Que Rico El Mambo , quickly crossed over to a wider U.S. audience.
