NCS involves administering small electrical impulses to the nerves, on the surface of the skin, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. NCS investigation in LEMS primarily involves evaluation of compound motor action potentials of effected muscles and sometimes EMG single-fiber examination can be used.     CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and conduction velocities. If repeated impulses are administered , it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the motor end plate is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all can be attributed to insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly . This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli . This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter and blocking.     Blood tests may be performed to exclude other causes of muscle disease .
