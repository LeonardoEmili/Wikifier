              Alan Jay Lerner was an American  |lyricist|Lyricist|  and  |librettist|Librettist| . In collaboration with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe| , and later  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane| , he created some of the worlds most popular and enduring works of  |musical_theatre|Musical_Theatre|  both for the stage and on film. He won three  |Tony_Awards|Tony_Award|  and three  |Academy_Awards|Academy_Awards| , among other honors.       Born in  |New_York_City|New_York_City| , he was the son of Edith Adelson Lerner and Joseph Jay Lerner, whose brother, Samuel Alexander Lerner, was founder and owner of the  |Lerner_Stores|Lerner_Stores| , a chain of dress shops. One of Lerners cousins was the radio comedian and television game show panelist  |Henry_Morgan|Henry_Morgan| . Lerner was educated at  |Bedales_School|Bedales_School|  in England,  |The_Choate_School|Choate_Rosemary_Hall|  in Wallingford, Connecticut, and  |Harvard|Harvard_University| . He attended both  |Camp_Androscoggin|Camp_Androscoggin|  and  |Camp_Greylock|Camp_Greylock| .  The New York Times , June 14, 1992 At both Choate and Harvard, Lerner was a classmate of  |John_F._Kennedys|John_F._Kennedy| ; at Choate they had worked together on the yearbook staff.   |Turner_Classic_Movies|Turner_Classic_Movies| , accessed August 1, 2009 Like  |Cole_Porter|Cole_Porter|  at  |Yale|Yale|  and  |Richard_Rodgers|Richard_Rodgers|  at  |Columbia|Columbia_University| , his career in musical theater began with his collegiate contributions, in Lerners case to the annual Harvard  |Hasty_Pudding|Hasty_Pudding_Theatricals|  musicals. Green, p.238 During the summers of 1936 and 1937, Lerner studied music composition at  |Juilliard|Juilliard| . While attending Harvard, he lost his sight in his left eye due to an accident in the boxing ring. In 1957, Lerner and  |Leonard_Bernstein|Leonard_Bernstein| , another of Lerners college classmates, collaborated on Lonely Men of Harvard, a tongue-in-cheek salute to their alma mater.       Due to his eye injury, Lerner could not serve in  |World_War_II|World_War_Ii| . Instead he wrote  |radio|Radio|  scripts, including  Your Hit Parade , until he was introduced to  |Austria|Austria| n composer  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe| , who needed a partner, in 1942 at the  |Lambs_Club|Lambs_Club| . While at the Lambs, he also met  |Lorenz_Hart|Lorenz_Hart| , with whom he would also collaborate.       |Lerner_and_Loewes|Lerner_And_Loewe|  first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Connerss farce The Patsy called Life of the Party for a  |Detroit|Detroit| |stock_company|Stock_Company| . The lyrics were mostly written by Earle Crooker, but he had left the project, with the score needing vast improvement. It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for  Whats Up? , which opened on Broadway in 1943. It ran for 63 performances and was followed two years later by  The Day Before Spring . Green, p. 239     Their first hit was  Brigadoon  , a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by  |Robert_Lewis|Robert_Lewis| . It was followed in 1951 by the  |Gold_Rush|California_Gold_Rush|  story  Paint Your Wagon . While the show ran for nearly a year and included songs that later became pop standards, it was less successful than Lerners previous work. He later said of Paint Your Wagon, it was a success but not a hit.      Lerner worked with  |Kurt_Weill|Kurt_Weill|  on the stage musical  Love Life  and  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane|  on the movie musical  Royal Wedding  . In that same year Lerner also wrote the  |Oscar-winning|Academy_Awards|  original  |screenplay|Screenplay|  for  An American in Paris , produced by  |Arthur_Freed|Arthur_Freed|  and directed by  |Vincente_Minnelli|Vincente_Minnelli| . This was the same team who would later join with Lerner and Loewe to create  Gigi .     In 1956, Lerner and Loewe unveiled  My Fair Lady . By this time, too, Lerner and  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane|  were already working on a musical about  |Lil_Abner|Lil_Abner| .  |Gabriel_Pascal|Gabriel_Pascal|  owned the rights to Pygmalion, which had been unsuccessful with other composers who tried to adapt it into a musical.  |Arthur_Schwartz|Arthur_Schwartz|  and  |Howard_Dietz|Howard_Dietz|  first tried, and then  |Richard_Rodgers|Richard_Rodgers|  and  |Oscar_Hammerstein_II|Oscar_Hammerstein_Ii|  attempted, but gave up and Hammerstein told Lerner, Pygmalion had no subplot . Lerner and Loewes adaptation of  |George_Bernard_Shaws|George_Bernard_Shaw|   Pygmalion  retained his social commentary and added appropriate songs for the characters of Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, played originally by  |Rex_Harrison|Rex_Harrison|  and  |Julie_Andrews|Julie_Andrews| . It set box-office records in  |New_York|New_York_City|  and  |London|London| . When brought to the screen in 1964, the movie version won eight  |Oscars|Academy_Awards| , including Best Picture and Best Actor for  |Rex_Harrison|Rex_Harrison| .     Lerner and Loewes run of success continued with their next project, a film adaptation of stories from  |Colette|Colette| , the  |Academy_Award|Academy_Awards| -winning film musical  Gigi , starring  |Leslie_Caron|Leslie_Caron| ,  |Louis_Jourdan|Louis_Jourdan|  and  |Maurice_Chevalier|Maurice_Chevalier| . The film won all of its nine Oscar nominations, a record at that time, and a special Oscar for co-star Maurice Chevalier.     The Lerner-Loewe partnership cracked under the stress of producing the Arthurian  Camelot  in 1960, with Loewe resisting Lerners desire to direct as well as write when original director  |Moss_Hart|Moss_Hart|  suffered a heart attack in the last few months of rehearsals and died shortly after the shows premiere. Lerner was hospitalized with  |bleeding_ulcers|Bleeding_Ulcer|  while Loewe continued to have heart troubles. Camelot was a hit nonetheless, and immediately following the assassination of  |John_F._Kennedy|John_F._Kennedy| , his widow told reporter  |Theodore_H._White|Theodore_H._White|  that JFKs administration reminded her of the one brief shining moment of Lerner and Loewes Camelot. As of the early 21st century, Camelot was still invoked to describe the  |idealism|Idealism| ,  |romance|Romanticism| , and  |tragedy|Tragedy|  of the Kennedy years.      Loewe retired to  |Palm_Springs,_California|Palm_Springs,_California| , while Lerner went through a series of musicals—some successful, some not—with such composers as  |André_Previn|André_Previn|  ,  |John_Barry|John_Barry|  ,  |Leonard_Bernstein|Leonard_Bernstein|  ,  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane|   and  |Charles_Strouse|Charles_Strouse|  . Most biographers blame Lerners professional decline on the lack of a strong director with whom Lerner could collaborate, as  |Neil_Simon|Neil_Simon|  did with  |Mike_Nichols|Mike_Nichols|  or  |Stephen_Sondheim|Stephen_Sondheim|  with  |Harold_Prince|Harold_Prince|  . In 1965 Lerner collaborated again with  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane|  on the musical  On a Clear Day You Can See Forever , which was adapted for film in 1970. At this time, Lerner was hired by film producer  |Arthur_P._Jacobs|Arthur_P._Jacobs|  to write a treatment for an upcoming film project,  Doctor Dolittle , but Lerner abrogated his contract after several non-productive months of non-communicative procrastination and was replaced with  |Leslie_Bricusse|Leslie_Bricusse| .  Lerner was inducted into the  |Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame|Songwriters_Hall_Of_Fame|  in 1971.     In 1973, Lerner coaxed Loewe out of retirement to augment the Gigi score for a  |musical_stage_adaptation|Gigi| . The following year they collaborated on a musical film version of  The Little Prince , based on the classic childrens tale by  |Antoine_de_Saint-Exupéry|Antoine_De_Saint-Exupéry| . This film was a critical and box office failure, but it has gained a modern following.     Lerners autobiography, The Street Where I Live , was an account of three of his and Loewes successful collaborations, My Fair Lady, Gigi, and Camelot, along with personal information. In the last year of his life, he published The Musical Theatre: A Celebration, a well-reviewed history of the theatre, with personal anecdotes and humor. The Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote: There are several reasons why this book makes a fine introduction to musical theater. One is that Lerner knows exactly what was new, and when and why....In The Musical Theatre, one is privy to the judgment of a man... who expresses his opinions in a forthright, warm and personal manner. Curcio, Vincent.  Los Angeles Times, November 30, 1986 A book of Lerners lyrics entitled A Hymn To Him, edited by a British writer  |Benny_Green|Benny_Green| , was published in 1987.     At the time of Lerners death, he had been working with  |Gerard_Kenny|Gerard_Kenny|  and  |Kristi_Kane|Kristi_Kane|  in London on a musical version of the film  My Man Godfrey . He had also received an urgent call from  |Andrew_Lloyd_Webber|Andrew_Lloyd_Webber| , asking him to write the lyrics to  The Phantom of the Opera . He wrote  |Masquerade|Masquerade|  , but he then informed Webber that he wanted to leave the project because he was losing his memory and  |Charles_Hart|Charles_Hart|  replaced him.   He had turned down an invitation to write the English-language lyrics for the musical version of  Les Misérables .      After Lerners death, Paul Blake made a musical revue based on Lerners lyrics and life entitled Almost Like Being In Love, which featured music by  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe| ,  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane| ,  |André_Previn|André_Previn| ,  |Charles_Strouse|Charles_Strouse| , and  |Kurt_Weill|Kurt_Weill| .   The show ran for 10 days at the  |Herbst_Theatre|Herbst_Theatre|  in  |San_Francisco|San_Francisco,_California| .       Lerner often struggled with writing his lyrics. He was uncharacteristically able to complete  |I_Could_Have_Danced_All_Night|I_Could_Have_Danced_All_Night|  from  My Fair Lady  in one 24-hour period. He usually spent months on each song and was constantly rewriting them. Lerner was said to have insecurity about his talent. He would sometimes write songs with someone in mind, for instance,  |Ive_Grown_Accustomed_To_Her_Face|Ive_Grown_Accustomed_To_Her_Face|  from  My Fair Lady  was written with  |Rex_Harrison|Rex_Harrison|  in mind to complement his very limited vocal range.     Lerner said of writing:         In a 1979 interview on  |NPRs|Npr|   All Things Considered , Lerner went into some depth about his lyrics for  My Fair Lady . Professor Henry Higgins sings, Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters / Condemned by every syllable she utters / By right she should be taken out and hung / For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue. Lerner said he knew the lyric used incorrect grammar for the sake of a rhyme. He was later approached about it by another lyricist:          Alan Jay Lerner was an advocate for writers rights in theatre. He was a member of the  |Dramatists_Guild_of_America|Dramatists_Guild_Of_America| . In 1960, he was elected as the twelfth president of the non-profit organization. He continued to serve as the Guilds president until 1964.       For nearly twenty years, Lerner was  |addicted|Substance_Use_Disorder|  to  |amphetamine|Amphetamine| ; during the 1960s he was a patient of  |Max_Jacobson|Max_Jacobson| , known as Dr. Feelgood , who administered injections of vitamins with enzymes that were in fact laced with amphetamine. Lerners addiction is believed to have been the result of Jacobsons practice.         Lerner married eight times: Ruth Boyd , singer  |Marion_Bell|Marion_Bell|  , actress  |Nancy_Olson|Nancy_Olson|  , lawyer Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo , editor Karen Gundersen ,  |Sandra_Payne|Sandra_Payne|  , Nina Bushkin and  |Liz_Robertson|Liz_Robertson|  . Four of his eight wives – Olson, Payne, Bushkin, and Robertson – were actresses.   His seventh wife, Nina Bushkin, whom he married on May 30, 1977, was the director of development at  |Mannes_College_of_Music|Mannes_College_Of_Music|  and the daughter of composer and musician  |Joey_Bushkin|Joey_Bushkin| . Note on People , The New York Times, June 10, 1977, p. 19 After their divorce in 1981, Lerner was ordered to pay her a settlement of $50,000.  Lerner wrote in his autobiography  One of his ex-wives reportedly said, Marriage is Alans way of saying goodbye.      Lerner had four children: three daughters, Susan , Liza and Jennifer ; and one son, screenwriter and journalist  |Michael_Alan_Lerner|Michael_Alan_Lerner|  .          Lerners multiple divorces cost him much of his wealth, but he was primarily responsible for his own financial ups and downs and was apparently less than truthful about his financial fecklessness.  One persistent fiction, widely publicized, was that his divorce settlement from Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo cost him an estimated $1 million in 1965. This was a gross distortion of the truth.  Lerners pattern of financial mismanagement continued until his death from cancer in 1986, when he reportedly owed the  |US_Internal_Revenue_Service|Us_Internal_Revenue_Service|  over US$1,000,000 in back taxes and was unable to pay for his final medical expenses.        On June 14, 1986, Lerner died of  |lung_cancer|Lung_Cancer|  in  |Manhattan|Manhattan|  at the age of 67. At the time of his death he was married to actress  |Liz_Robertson|Liz_Robertson| , who was 36 years his junior. He lived in  |Center_Island,_New_York|Center_Island,_New_York| .  He has a memorial plaque in  |St_Pauls_Church|St_Pauls,_Covent_Garden| , the Actors Church in  |Covent_Garden|Covent_Garden|  in London.          |American_Theater_Hall_of_Fame|American_Theater_Hall_Of_Fame|  1979     |Kennedy_Center_Honors|Kennedy_Center_Honors|  1985  kennedy-center.org, retrieved July 13, 2019     ;Academy Award    |Best_Original_Screenplay|Academy_Award_For_Writing_Original_Screenplay| , 1951  An American in Paris   |Best_Adapted_Screenplay|Academy_Award_For_Writing_Adapted_Screenplay| , 1958  Gigi   |Best_Original_Song|Academy_Award_For_Best_Original_Song| , 1958  Gigi      ; |Golden_Globes|Golden_Globes|   goldenglobes.com, retrieved July 13, 2019    |Best_Original_Song|Golden_Globe_Award_For_Best_Original_Song| , 1968  Camelot   |Best_Original_Score|Golden_Globe_Award_For_Best_Original_Score| , 1975  The Little Prince      ; |Tony_Award|Tony_Award|   playbill.com, retrieved July 13, 2019    |Best_Book_of_a_Musical|Tony_Award_For_Best_Book_Of_A_Musical| , 1957  My Fair Lady   |Best_Original_Score|Tony_Award_For_Best_Original_Score| , 1957  My Fair Lady  and 1974  Gigi      ; |New_York_Drama_Critics_Circle|New_York_Drama_Critics_Circle| |Best_Musical|New_York_Drama_Critics_Circle| , 1947  Brigadoon   |Best_Musical|New_York_Drama_Critics_Circle| , 1956  My Fair Lady      ;Johnny Mercer Award  songhall.org, retrieved July 13, 2019    |Lyric_Writing|National_Academy_Of_Popular_Music| , 1985, Lifetime            Life of the Party  , with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   Whats Up?  , with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   The Day Before Spring  , with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   Brigadoon  , with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   Love Life  , with  |Kurt_Weill|Kurt_Weill|   Paint Your Wagon  ,  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   My Fair Lady  , with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   Camelot  , with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   On a Clear Day You Can See Forever  , with  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane|   Coco  , with  |André_Previn|André_Previn|   Lolita, My Love  , with  |John_Barry|John_Barry|   Gigi  , based on the 1958  |film_of_the_same_name|Gigi| , with  |Frederick_Loewe|Frederick_Loewe|   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  , with  |Leonard_Bernstein|Leonard_Bernstein|   Carmelina  , with  |Burton_Lane|Burton_Lane|  and  |Joseph_Stein|Joseph_Stein|   Dance a Little Closer  , with  |Charles_Strouse|Charles_Strouse|  My Man Godfrey , unfinished, with  |Gerard_Kenny|Gerard_Kenny|         Source: TCM  tcm.com, retrieved July 13, 2019      Royal Wedding , 1951    An American in Paris     Brigadoon , 1954    Gigi , 1958   The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 1960    My Fair Lady , 1964    Camelot , 1967    Paint Your Wagon , 1969    On a Clear Day You Can See Forever , 1970    The Little Prince , 1974    Tribute , 1980   Secret Places .
