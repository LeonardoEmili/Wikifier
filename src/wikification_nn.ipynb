Other diesel engines, such as the precombustion chamber engine XII Jv 170/240 made by Ganz & Co., have a valve timing changing system that is operated by adjusting the inlet valve camshaft, moving it into a slight late position. This will make the inlet valves open with a delay, forcing the inlet air to heat up when entering the combustion chamber.             As the diesel engine relies on manipulation of \\lambda_v for torque controlling and speed regulation, the intake air mass does not have to precisely match the injected fuel mass . diesel engines are thus ideally suited for supercharging and turbocharging. An additional advantage of the diesel engine is the lack of fuel during the compression stroke. In diesel engines, the fuel is injected near top dead centre , when the piston is near its highest position. The fuel then ignites due to compression heat. Preignition, caused by the artificial turbocharger compression increase during the compression stroke, cannot occur.     Many diesels are therefore \n",

Every variety of philosophical and theological opinion was represented there, and expressed itself with entire openness; most of my colleagues were ists of one sort or another; and, however kind and friendly they might be, I, the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with, could not fail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset the historical fox when, after leaving the trap in which his tail remained, he presented himself to his normally elongated companions.

The energy which is lost at the destructive interference is regained at the constructive interference.   One wave is travelling horizontally, and the other is travelling downwards at an angle θ to the first wave.

This can be expressed mathematically as follows.

      " \\Psi . This is the approach commonly taken in introductory treatments of quantum mechanics, using the formalism of Schrödingers wave mechanics.     One can also make substitutions to certain variables to fit specific cases, such as some involving electromagnetic fields.         The formalism can be extended to N particles:     : \\hat \\sum_^N \\hat_n + V     where   : V V ,   is the potential energy function, now a function of the spatial configuration of the system and time and;   : \\hat_n \\frac ,   is the kinetic energy operator of particle n , and \\nabla_n is the gradient for particle n , \\nabla_n^2 is the Laplacian for particle using the coordinates:   : \\nabla_n^2 \\frac + \\frac + \\frac,     Combining these yields the Schrödinger Hamiltonian for the N -particle case:     : \\begin \\hat & \\sum_^N \\hat_n + V \\\\   & \\sum_^N \\frac+ V \\\\   & -\\frac\\sum_^N \\frac\\nabla_n^2 + V   \\end     However, complications can arise in the \n",
      ". Since the potential energy depends on the spatial arrangement of the particles, the kinetic energy will also depend on the spatial configuration to conserve energy. The motion due to any one particle will vary due to the motion of all the other particles in the system. For this reason cross terms for kinetic energy may appear in the Hamiltonian; a mix of the gradients for two particles:     : -\\frac\\nabla_i\\cdot\\nabla_j     where M denotes the mass of the collection of particles resulting in this extra kinetic energy. Terms of this form are known as mass polarization terms, and appear in the Hamiltonian of many electron atoms .     For N interacting particles, i.e. particles which interact mutually and constitute a many-body situation, the potential energy function V is not simply a sum of the separate potentials . The potential energy function can only be written as above: a function of all the spatial positions of each particle.     For non-interacting particles, i.e. particles which do not interact mutually and move independently, the potential of the system is the sum of the separate potential energy for each particle, Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles , R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985,  that is     : V \\sum_^N V V + V + \\cdots + V     The general form of the Hamiltonian in this case is:     : \\begin \\hat & -\\frac\\sum_^N \\frac\\nabla_i^2 + \\sum_^N V_i \\\\   & \\sum_^N \\left \\\\   & \\sum_^N \\hat_i   \\end     where the sum is taken over all particles and their corresponding potentials; the result is that the Hamiltonian of the system is the sum of the separate Hamiltonians for each particle. This is an idealized situation - in practice the particles are almost always influenced by some potential, and there are many-body interactions. One illustrative example of a two-body interaction where this form would not apply is for electrostatic potentials due to charged particles, because they interact with each other by Coulomb interaction , as shown below.            The Hamiltonian generates the time evolution of quantum states.

      ".     From a mathematically rigorous point of view, care must be taken with the above assumptions. Operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces need not have eigenvalues . However, all routine quantum mechanical calculations can be done using the physical formulation.         Following are expressions for the Hamiltonian in a number of situations. Quanta: A handbook of concepts, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974,  Typical ways to classify the expressions are the number of particles, number of dimensions, and the nature of the potential energy function - importantly space and time dependence. Masses are denoted by m , and charges by q .             The particle is not bound by any potential energy, so the potential is zero and this Hamiltonian is the simplest. For one dimension:     : \\hat -\\frac\\frac     and in higher dimensions:     : \\hat -\\frac\\nabla^2         For a particle in a region of constant potential V V_0 , in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:     : \\hat -\\frac\\frac + V_0     in three dimensions     : \\hat -\\frac\\nabla^2 + V_0     This applies to the elementary \n",

Thus the rule applies to situations in which the ratio of the derivatives has a finite or infinite limit, but not to situations in which that ratio fluctuates permanently as  gets closer and closer to .

Although we have written x   & rarr; c throughout, the limits may also be one-sided limits , when  is a finite endpoint of .     In the second case, the hypothesis that  \n",
      " to infinity is not used in the proof ; thus, while the conditions of the rule are normally stated as above, the second sufficient condition for the rules procedure to be valid can be more briefly stated as \\lim_|g| \\infty.     The hypothesis that g\\ne 0 appears most commonly in the literature, but some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses elsewhere. One method  is to define the limit of a function with the additional requirement that the limiting function is defined everywhere on the relevant interval  except possibly at . Another method  is to require that both  and  be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing .       The requirement that the limit     : \\lim_\\frac     must exist is essential. Without this condition, f or g may exhibit undampened oscillations as x approaches c , in which case LHôpitals rule does not apply. For example, if fx+\\sin , gx and c\\pm\\infty , then     : \\frac\\frac;     this expression does not approach a limit as x goes to c , since the cosine function oscillates between  and . But working with the original functions, \\lim_\\frac can be shown to exist:     : \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\left 1.     In a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that     : \\liminf_ \\frac \\leq \\liminf_ \\frac \\leq \\limsup_ \\frac \\leq \\limsup_ \\frac ,     so that if the limit of f/g exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of f & prime;/g & prime;.       Here is a basic example involving the exponential function, which involves the indeterminate form  at :     ::   \\begin   \\lim_ \\frac & \\lim_ \\frac \\\\   & \\lim_ \\frac \\\\   & 1.   \\end       This is a more elaborate example involving . Applying LHôpitals rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times:     ::   \\begin   \\lim_   & \\lim_ \\\\   & \\lim_ \\\\   & \\lim_ \\\\   & \\\\   & 6.   \\end       Here is an example involving :     :: \\lim_x^n\\cdot e^   \\lim_   \\lim_   n\\cdot \\lim_.     :Repeatedly apply LHôpitals rule until the exponent is zero  or negative  to conclude that the limit is zero.     Here is an example involving the indeterminate form  , which is rewritten as the form :     :: \\lim_x \\ln x \\lim_ \\frac   \\lim_ \\frac   \\lim_ -x 0.     Here is an example involving the \n",
      " and . Let  be the principal ,  the interest rate per period and  the number of periods. When  is zero, the repayment amount per period is \\frac ; this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates:     :: \\begin   \\lim_\\frac   & P \\lim_ \\frac \\\\   & \\frac.   \\end     One can also use LHôpitals rule to prove the following theorem. If  is twice-differentiable in a neighborhood of , then     :: \\begin   \\lim_\\frac   & \\lim_\\frac \\\\   & \\lim_\\frac \\\\   & f.   \\end     Sometimes LHôpitals rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose converges as and that e^x\\cdot f converges to positive or negative infinity. Then:   :: \\lim_f \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\bigl   :and so,   \\lim_f   exists and   \\lim_f 0.   :The result remains true without the added hypothesis that e^x\\cdot f converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.       Sometimes LHôpitals rule does not lead to an answer in a finite number of steps unless some additional steps are applied. Examples include the following:     Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated:     :: \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\cdots .     :This situation can be dealt with by substituting ye^x and noting that goes to infinity as goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule:     :: \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\frac 1.     :Alternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by e^x, at which point LHôpitals rule can immediately be applied successfully: Multiplying by e^-x instead yields a solution to the limit without need for lHôpitals rule.     :: \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac 1.     An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:     :: \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\cdots .     :This situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case y \\sqrt :     :: \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_ \\frac \\frac1 1.     :Again, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by x^ before applying LHôpitals rule:     :: \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac 1.     A common pitfall is using LHôpitals rule with some circular reasoning to compute a derivative via a difference quotient . For example, consider the task of proving the derivative formula for powers of x :     : \\lim_\\fracnx^.     Applying LHôpitals rule and finding the derivatives with respect to of the numerator and the denominator yields   as expected. However, differentiating the numerator required the use of the very fact that is being proven. This is an example of begging the question , since one may not assume the fact to be proven during the course of the proof.       The necessity of the condition that g\\ne 0 near c can be seen by the following counterexample due to Otto Stolz . Let fx+\\sin x \\cos x and gfe^. Then there is no limit for f/g as x\\to\\infty. However,     : \\begin   \\frac & \\frac \\\\   & \\frac e^,   \\end     which tends to 0 as x\\to\\infty . Further examples of this type were found by Ralph P. Boas Jr.       Other indeterminate forms, such as , , , , and , can sometimes be evaluated using LHôpitals rule. For example, to evaluate a limit involving , convert the difference of two functions to a quotient:     :   \\begin   \\lim_\\left   & \\lim_\\frac & \\quad \\\\   & \\lim_\\frac & \\quad \\\\   & \\lim_\\frac & \\quad \\\\   & \\lim_\\frac & \\quad \\\\   & \\lim_\\frac \\\\   & \\frac,   \\end       where LHôpitals rule is applied when going from to and again when going from to .     LHôpitals rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving exponents by using logarithm s to move the exponent down . Here is an example involving the indeterminate form :     :   \\lim_x^x   \\lim_e^   \\lim_e^   e^.       It is valid to move the limit inside the exponential function because the exponential function is continuous . Now the exponent x has been moved down . The limit \\lim_x\\cdot\\ln x is of the indeterminate form , but as shown in an example above, lHôpitals rule may be used to determine that     : \\lim_x\\cdot\\ln x 0.     Thus     : \\lim_x^x e^0 1.           The Stolz–Cesàro theorem is a similar result involving limits of sequences, but it uses finite difference operator s rather than derivative s.       Consider the curve in the plane whose -coordinate is given by and whose -coordinate is given by , with both functions continuous, i.e., the locus of points of the form . Suppose . The limit of the ratio as is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point . The tangent to the curve at the point is given by . LHôpitals rule then states that the slope of the curve when is the limit of the slope of the tangent to the curve as the curve approaches the origin, provided that this is defined.           The proof of LHôpitals rule is simple in the case where and are continuously differentiable at the point and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. It is not a proof of the general LHôpitals rule because it is stricter in its definition, requiring both differentiability and that c be a real number. Since many common functions have continuous derivatives , it is a special case worthy of attention.     Suppose that and are continuously differentiable at a real number , that fg0 , and that g\\neq 0 . Then     :   \\begin   & \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\lim_\\frac \\\\   & \\lim_\\frac \\frac \\frac \\lim_\\frac.   \\end       This follows from the difference-quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at . The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because g\\ne 0 .     The proof of a more general version of LHôpitals rule is given below.       The following proof is due to , where a unified proof for the and indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in and .     Let f and g be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the General form section. Let \\mathcal be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint c. Considering that g\\ne 0 on this interval and g is continuous, \\mathcal can be chosen smaller so that g is nonzero on \\mathcal .     For each x in the interval, define m\\inf\\frac and M\\sup\\frac as \\xi ranges over all values between x and c.     From the differentiability of f and g on \\mathcal , Cauchys mean value theorem ensures that for any two distinct points x and y in \\mathcal there exists a \\xi between x and y such that \\frac\\frac . Consequently, m\\leq \\frac \\leq M for all choices of distinct x and y in the interval. The value g-g is always nonzero for distinct x and y in the interval, for if it was not, the mean value theorem would imply the existence of a p between x and y such that g 0.     The definition of m and M will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values ±∞. In the following two cases, m and M will establish bounds on the ratio .     Case 1: \\lim_f\\lim_g0     For any x in the interval \\mathcal , and point y between x and c,   : m\\le \\frac\\frac\\le M   and therefore as y approaches c, \\frac and \\frac become zero, and so   : m\\leq\\frac\\leq M.     Case 2: \\lim_|g|\\infty     For every x in the interval \\mathcal , define S_x\\ . For every point y between x and c,   : m\\le \\frac\\frac \\le M.     As y approaches c, both \\frac and \\frac become zero, and therefore   : m\\le \\liminf_ \\frac \\le \\limsup_ \\frac \\le M.     The limit superior and limit inferior are necessary since the existence of the limit of has not yet been established.     It is also the case that   : \\lim_m\\lim_M\\lim_\\fracL.   \n",

Let n denote a complete set of quantum numbers for specifying single-particle states  For simplicity, consider a system composed of two particles that are not interacting with each other.

Intuitively, the quantum state of the system is written as     : | n_1 \\rang | n_2 \\rang     where the state writing order matters such as the firstly written state is for the particle 1 and the secondly written state is for the particle 2 . This is simply the canonical way of constructing a basis for a \n",

This expression is valid for distinguishable particles, however, it is not appropriate for indistinguishable particles since |n_1\\rang |n_2\\rang and |n_2\\rang |n_1\\rang as a result of exchanging the particles are generally different states.     the particle 1 occupies the n 1 state and the particle 2 occupies the n 2 state ≠ the particle 1 occupies the n 2 state and the particle 2 occupies the n 1 state .     Two states are physically equivalent only if they differ by a complex phase factor. For two indistinguishable particles, a state before the particle exchange must be physically equivalent to the state after the exchange, so these two state differ only by a complex phase factor. This fact suggests that a state for two indistinguishable particles is given by following two possibilities:        : |n_1\\rang |n_2\\rang \\pm |n_2\\rang |n_1\\rang     States where it is a sum are known as symmetric, while states involving the difference are called antisymmetric.

On the other hand, it can be shown that the symmetric and antisymmetric states are in a sense special, by examining a particular symmetry of the multiple-particle states known as exchange symmetry.

This is the manifestation of symmetry and antisymmetry in the wavefunction representation:     :   \\Psi^_   \\Psi^_     :   \\Psi^_ -   \\Psi^_       The many-body wavefunction has the following significance: if the system is initially in a state with quantum numbers n 1 , ..., n N , and a position measurement is performed, the probability of finding particles in infinitesimal volumes near x 1 , x 2 , ..., x N is     : N! \\; \\left|\\Psi^_ \\right|^2 \\; d^\\!x     The factor of N! comes from our normalizing constant, which has been chosen so that, by analogy with single-particle wavefunctions,     : \\int\\!\\int\\!\\cdots\\!\\int\\; \\left|\\Psi^_ \\right|^2 d^3\\!x_1 d^3\\!x_2 \\cdots d^3\\!x_N 1     Because each integral runs over all possible values of x, each multi-particle state appears N! times in the integral. In other words, the probability associated with each event is evenly distributed across N! equivalent points in the integral space. Because it is usually more convenient to work with unrestricted integrals than restricted ones, the normalizing constant has been chosen to reflect this.     Finally, antisymmetric wavefunction can be written as the \n",

This means that for all \\psi \\in H and \\sigma \\in S_n   :   ^t a \\Psi^t a \\Psi,     or equivalently for each \\sigma \\in S_n   :   \\sigma^t a \\sigma a   .

      ".     Moreover, because the composition of a conformal transformation with another conformal transformation is also conformal, the composition of a solution of the Cauchy–Riemann equations with a conformal map must itself solve the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Thus the Cauchy–Riemann equations are conformally invariant.       Suppose that     : f u + i \\cdot v     is a function of a complex number z. Then the complex derivative of f at a point z 0 is defined by     : \\lim_ \\frac f     provided this limit exists.     If this limit exists, then it may be computed by taking the limit as h  → 0 along the real axis or imaginary axis; in either case it should give the same result. Approaching along the real axis, one finds     : \\lim_ \\frac \\frac.     On the other hand, approaching along the imaginary axis,     : \\lim_ \\frac \\frac\\frac.     The equality of the derivative of f taken along the two axis is     : i\\frac\\frac,     which are the Cauchy–Riemann equations at the point  z 0 .     Conversely, if f  : ℂ  →  ℂ is a function which is differentiable when regarded as a function on ℝ 2 , then f is complex differentiable if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold. In other words, if u and v are real-differentiable functions of two real variables, obviously u + iv is a real-differentiable function, but u + iv is complex-differentiable if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold.     Indeed, following , suppose f is a complex function defined in an open set Ω  ⊂ ℂ. Then, writing  for every z  ∈ Ω, one can also regard Ω as an open subset of ℝ 2 , and f as a function of two real variables x and y, which maps Ω  ⊂ ℝ 2 to ℂ. We consider the Cauchy–Riemann equations at z   z 0 . So assume f is differentiable at z 0 , as a function of two real variables from Ω to ℂ. This is equivalent to the existence of the following linear approximation     : f - f f_x \\,\\Delta x + f_y \\,\\Delta y + \\eta \\,\\Delta z \\,     where z x + iy and η → 0 as Δz → 0. Since \\Delta z + \\Delta \\bar 2 \\, \\Delta x and \\Delta z - \\Delta \\bar2i \\, \\Delta y , the above can be re-written as     : \\Delta f \\frac \\, \\Delta z + \\frac \\, \\Delta \\bar + \\eta \\, \\Delta z\\,     Defining the two \n",

Now consider the potential values of d\\bar/dz when the limit is taken at the origin. For z along the real line, \\bar z so that d\\bar/dz 1 . Similarly for purely imaginary z we have d\\bar/dz -1 so that the value of d\\bar/dz is not well defined at the origin. Its easy to verify that d\\bar/dz is not well defined at any complex z, hence f is complex differentiable at z 0 if and only if 0 at zz_0 . But this is exactly the Cauchy–Riemann equations, thus f is differentiable at z 0 if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold at  z 0 .         The above proof suggests another interpretation of the Cauchy–Riemann equations. The \n",

Blocksize is 64 when using one of the following hash functions: SHA-1, MD5, RIPEMD-128/160.     Function hmac   Inputs:   key: Bytes //array of bytes   message: Bytes //array of bytes to be hashed   hash: Function //the hash function to use   blockSize: Integer //the block size of the underlying hash function   outputSize: Integer //the output size of the underlying hash function     //Keys longer than blockSize are shortened by hashing them   if b style color:blue /b span style color: green; /span span style color:green /span b style color:blue /b span style color:black then   key ← Pad //pad key with zeros to make it blockSize bytes long     o_key_pad ← key xor //Outer padded key   i_key_pad ← key xor //Inner padded key     return hash //Where ∥ is concatenation       The design of the HMAC specification was motivated by the existence of attacks on more trivial mechanisms for combining a key with a hash function. For example, one might assume the same security that HMAC provides could be achieved with MAC H. However, this method suffers from a serious flaw: with most hash functions, it is easy to append data to the message without knowing the key and obtain another valid MAC . The alternative, appending the key using MAC H, suffers from the problem that an attacker who can find a collision in the hash function has a collision in the MAC . Using MAC H is better, but various security papers have suggested vulnerabilities with this approach, even when two different keys are used.     No known extension attacks have been found against the current HMAC specification which is defined as H because the outer application of the hash function masks the intermediate result of the internal hash. The values of ipad and opad are not critical to the security of the algorithm, but were defined in such a way to have a large Hamming distance from each other and so the inner and outer keys will have fewer bits in common. The security reduction of HMAC does require them to be different in at least one bit.     The Keccak hash function, that was selected by NIST as the SHA-3 competition winner, doesnt need this nested approach and can be used to generate a MAC by simply prepending the key to the message, as it is not susceptible to length-extension attacks.         The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the size of the secret key that is used. The most common attack against HMACs is brute force to uncover the secret key. HMACs are substantially less affected by collisions than their underlying hashing algorithms alone.     In particular, in 2006 Mihir Bellare proved that HMAC is a PRF under the sole assumption that the compression function is a PRF.   Therefore, HMAC-MD5 does not suffer from the same weaknesses that have been found in MD5.     RFC2104 requires that keys longer than B bytes are first hashed using H which leads to a confusing pseudo-collision: if the key is longer than the hash block size , then HMAC is computed as HMAC. This property is sometimes raised as a possible weakness of HMAC in password-hashing scenarios: it has been demonstrated that its possible to find a long ASCII string and a random value whose hash will be also an ASCII string, and both values will produce the same HMAC output.     In 2006, Jongsung Kim , Alex Biryukov , Bart Preneel , and Seokhie Hong showed how to distinguish HMAC with reduced versions of MD5 and SHA-1 or full versions of HAVAL , MD4 , and SHA-0 from a random function or HMAC with a random function. Differential distinguishers allow an attacker to devise a forgery attack on HMAC. Furthermore, differential and rectangle distinguishers can lead to second-preimage attacks . HMAC with the full version of MD4 can be forged with this knowledge. These attacks do not contradict the security proof of HMAC, but provide insight into HMAC based on existing cryptographic hash functions.       In 2009, Xiaoyun Wang et al. presented a distinguishing attack on HMAC-MD5 without using related keys. It can distinguish an instantiation of HMAC with MD5 from an instantiation with a random function with 2 97 queries with probability 0.87.       In 2011 an informational RFC 6151 was published to summarize security considerations in MD5 and HMAC-MD5. For HMAC-MD5 the RFC summarizes that – although the security of the MD5 hash function itself is severely compromised – the currently known  attacks on HMAC-MD5 do not seem to indicate a practical vulnerability when used as a message authentication code , but it also adds that  for a new protocol design, a ciphersuite with HMAC-MD5 should not be included \n",
      ". Normally, however, the most oxygen-lean of the divers decompression gases would be used for this purpose, since descent time spent reaching a depth where bottom mix is no longer hypoxic is normally small, and the distance between this depth and the MOD of any nitrox decompression gas is likely to be very short, if it occurs at all.       The composition of a nitrox mix can be optimized for a given planned dive profile. This is termed Best mix , for the dive, and provides the maximum no-decompression time compatible with acceptable oxygen exposure.

      " uniformly continuous function f′ from M′ to N that extends f. The space M is determined up to isometry by this property , and is called the completion of M.     The completion of M can be constructed as a set of equivalence class es of Cauchy sequences in M. For any two Cauchy sequences x     and y     in M, we may define their distance as   : d \\lim_n d\\left     This is only a pseudometric , not yet a metric, since two different Cauchy sequences may have the distance 0. But having distance 0 is an equivalence relation on the set of all Cauchy sequences, and the set of equivalence classes is a metric space, the completion of M. The original space is embedded in this space via the identification of an element x of M with the equivalence class of sequences in M converging to x . This defines an isometry onto a dense subspace, as required. Notice, however, that this construction makes explicit use of the completeness of the real numbers, so completion of the rational numbers needs a slightly different treatment.     Cantor s construction of the real numbers is similar to the above construction; the real numbers are the completion of the rational numbers using the ordinary absolute value to measure distances. The additional subtlety to contend with is that it is not logically permissible to use the completeness of the real numbers in their own construction. Nevertheless, equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences are defined as above, and the set of equivalence classes is easily shown to be a field that has the rational numbers as a subfield. This field is complete, admits a natural total ordering , and is the unique totally ordered complete field . It is defined as the field of real numbers . One way to visualize this identification with the real numbers as usually viewed is that the equivalence class consisting of those Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that ought to have a given real limit is identified with that real number. The truncations of the decimal expansion give just one choice of Cauchy sequence in the relevant equivalence class.     For a prime p, the p-adic numbers arise by completing the rational numbers with respect to a different metric.     If the earlier completion procedure is applied to a normed vector space , the result is a Banach space containing the original space as a dense subspace, and if it is applied to an inner product space , the result is a Hilbert space containing the original space as a dense subspace.       Note that completeness is a property of the metric and not of the \n",

However, their derivatives are known:  is , and  is . The chain rule states that the derivative of the composite function is the product of the derivative of  and the derivative of . This is .     One of the reasons why this computation is possible is because  is a constant function. A more accurate description of how the temperature near the car varies over time would require an accurate model of how the temperature varies at different altitudes. This model may not have a constant derivative. To compute the temperature change in such a model, it would be necessary to know  and not just , because without knowing  it is not possible to know where to evaluate .       The chain rule can be applied to composites of more than two functions. To take the derivative of a composite of more than two functions, notice that the composite of , , and  is the composite of  with . The chain rule states that to compute the derivative of , it is sufficient to compute the derivative of  and the derivative of . The derivative of  can be calculated directly, and the derivative of  can be calculated by applying the chain rule again.     For concreteness, consider the function   : y e^.   This can be decomposed as the composite of three functions:   : \\begin   y & f e^u, \\\\   u & g \\sin v \\sin, \\\\   v & h x^2.   \\end   Their derivatives are:   : \\begin   \\frac & f e^u e^, \\\\   \\frac & g \\cos v \\cos, \\\\   \\frac & h 2x.   \\end     The chain rule states that the derivative of their composite at the point  is:     :   \\begin   & f\\cdot \\\\   & f \\cdot g \\cdot h \\cdot \\cdot h.   \\end       In Leibniz notation, this is:   : \\frac \\left.\\frac\\right|_\\cdot\\left.\\frac\\right|_\\cdot\\left.\\frac\\right|_,   or for short,   : \\frac \\frac\\cdot\\frac\\cdot\\frac.   The derivative function is therefore:   : \\frac e^\\cdot\\cos\\cdot 2x.     Another way of computing this derivative is to view the composite function  as the composite of  and h. Applying the chain rule in this manner would yield:   : \\cdot h f\\cdot g\\cdot h.     This is the same as what was computed above. This should be expected because .

Suppose we have a function f:\\mathbb\\times\\mathbb\\to\\mathbb which takes two real arguments and outputs real numbers, and it is defined by fx+y^2 . Currying translates this into a function h which takes a single real argument and outputs functions from \\mathbb to \\mathbb . In symbols, h:\\mathbb\\to\\mathbb^\\mathbb , where \\mathbb^\\mathbb denotes the set of all functions that take a single real argument and produce real outputs. For every real number x , define the function h_x : \\mathbb\\to\\mathbb by h_xx+y^2 , and then define the function h:\\mathbb\\to\\mathbb^\\mathbb by hh_x . So for instance, h is the function that sends its real argument y to the output 2+y^2 , or hh_22+y^2 . We see that in general     : hx+y^2f     so that the original function f and its currying h convey exactly the same information. In this situation, we also write     : \\text h.     This also works for functions with more than two arguments. If f were a function of three arguments f , its currying h would have the property     : fh.       The name currying , coined by \n",

Note that after calling f_\\text , we are left with a function that takes a single argument and returns another function, not a function that takes two arguments.     In contrast, partial function application refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.

From this, it can readily be seen that the linear aspect of the model means the following:   :the function to be minimised is a quadratic function of the β j  for which minimisation is a relatively simple problem;   :the derivatives of the function are linear functions of the β j  making it easy to find the minimising values;   :the minimising values β j  are linear functions of the observations Y i ;   :the minimising values β j  are linear functions of the random errors ε i  which makes it relatively easy to determine the statistical properties of the estimated values of β j .

In this case, the probability density function or probability mass function will be a special case of the more general form   : f_ f_\\theta   where x_0 is the location parameter, θ represents additional parameters, and f_\\theta is a function parametrized on the additional parameters.

A polynomial of degree zero is a constant polynomial or simply a constant. Polynomials of degree one, two or three are respectively linear polynomials, quadratic polynomials and cubic polynomials. For higher degrees the specific names are not commonly used, although quartic polynomial and quintic polynomial are sometimes used. The names for the degrees may be applied to the polynomial or to its terms. For example, in  the term  is a linear term in a quadratic polynomial.

If we put these values into an  matrix M, then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of f for any vector in V.

      " debates.        In 325, the first ecumenical council determined that Jesus Christ was God, consubstantial with the Father, and rejected the Arian contention that Jesus was a created being. This was reaffirmed at the First Council of Constantinople and the Council of Ephesus .         About two years after Cyril of Alexandria s death in 444, an aged monk from Constantinople named Eutyches began teaching a subtle variation on the traditional Christology in an attempt to stop what he saw as a new outbreak of Nestorianism . He claimed to be a faithful follower of Cyrils teaching, which was declared orthodox in the Union of 433.     Cyril had taught that There is only one physis, since it is the Incarnation, of God the Word. Cyril apparently thought that the Greek word physis meant approximately what the Latin word persona means, while most Greek theologians would have interpreted that word to mean natura . The energy and imprudence with which Eutyches asserted his opinions led to his being misunderstood. Thus, many believed that Eutyches was advocating Docetism , a sort of reversal of Arianism — where Arius had denied the consubstantial divinity of Jesus , Eutyches seemed to be denying that Jesus was fully human. Pope Leo I wrote that Eutyches error seemed to be more from a lack of skill than from malice.     Eutyches had been accusing various personages of covert Nestorianism. In November 448, Flavian, Bishop of Constantinople held a local synod regarding a point of discipline connected with the province of Sardis. At the end of the session of this synod one of those inculpated, Eusebius, Bishop of Dorylaeum , brought a counter charge of heresy against the archimandrite. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 February 2019 Eusebius demanded that Eutyches be removed from office. Flavian preferred that the bishop and the archimandrite sort out their differences, but as his suggestion went unheeded, Eutyches was summoned to clarify his position regarding the nature of Christ. Eventually Eutyches reluctantly appeared, but his position was considered to be theologically unsophisticated, and the synod finding his answers unresponsive condemned and exiled him. Flavian sent a full account to Pope Leo I . Although it had been accidentally delayed, Leo wrote a compendious explanation of the whole doctrine involved, and sent it to Flavian as a formal and authoritative decision of the question. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 8 February 2019     Eutyches appealed against the decision, labeling Flavian a Nestorian, and received the support of Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria . John Anthony McGuckin sees an innate rivalry between the Sees of Alexandria and Constantinople. McGuckin, John Anthony. St. Cyril of Alexandria: The Christological Controversy. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1994. p. 12 Dioscurus, imitating his predecessors in assuming a primacy over Constantinople, held his own synod which annulled the sentence of Flavian, and absolved Eutyches.           Through the influence of the court official Chrysaphius, godson of Eutyches, in 449, the competing claims between the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria led Emperor Theodosius II to call a council which was held in Ephesus in 449, with Dioscorus presiding.     Pope Leo sent four legates to represent him and expressed his regret that the shortness of the notice must prevent the presence of any other bishop of the West. He provided his legates, one of whom died en route, with a letter addressed to Flavian explaining Romes position in the controversy. Leos letter, now known as Leos Tome , confessed that Christ had two natures, and was not of or from two natures.     On August 8, 449 the Second Council of Ephesus began its first session. The Acts of the first session of this synod were read at the Council of Chalcedon, 451, and are thus preserved. The remainder of the Acts are known through a Syriac translation by a Monophysite monk, written in the year 535 and published from a manuscript in the British Museum. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 9 February 2019 Nonetheless, there are somewhat different interpretations as to what actually transpired. The question before the council by order of the emperor was whether Flavian, in a synod held by him at Constantinople in November, 448, had justly deposed and excommunicated the Archimandrite Eutyches for refusing to admit two natures in Christ.     Dioscorus began the council by banning all members of the November 448 synod which had deposed Eutyches from sitting as judges. He then introduced Eutyches who publicly professed that while Christ had two natures before the incarnation, the two natures had merged to form a single nature after the incarnation. Of the 130 assembled bishops, 111 voted to rehabilitate Eutyches.     Throughout these proceedings, Hilary repeatedly called for the reading of Leos Tome, but was ignored. The Eastern Orthodox Church has very different accounts of The Second Council of Ephesus. Pope Dioscorus requested deferring reading of Leos Tome, as it was not seen as necessary to start with, and could be read later. This was seen as a rebuke to the representatives from the Church of Rome not reading the Tome from the start.     Dioscorus then moved to depose Flavian of Constantinople and Eusebius of Dorylaeum on the grounds that they taught the Word had been made flesh and not just assumed flesh from the Virgin and that Christ had two natures. When Flavian and Hilary objected, Dioscorus called for a pro-monophysite mob to enter the church which assaulted Flavian as he clung to the altar. Flavian died three days later. Dioscorus then placed Eusebius of Dorylaeum under arrest and demanded the assembled bishops approve his actions. Fearing the mob, they all did. The papal legates refused to attend the second session at which several more orthodox bishops were deposed, including Ibas of Edessa, Irenaeus of Tyre, Domnus of Antioch, and Theodoret. Dioscorus then had Cyril of Alexandrias Twelve Anathemas declared orthodox Frend, W. H. C. , The Rise of the Monophysite Movement, Cambridge University Press, 1972, pps. 41–43 with the intent of condemning any confession other than one nature in Christ.     According to a letter to the Empress Pulcheria collected among the letters of Leo I, Hilary apologized for not delivering to her the popes letter after the synod, but owing to Dioscurus, who tried to hinder his going either to Rome or to Constantinople, he had great difficulty in making his escape in order to bring to the pontiff the news of the result of the council. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 9 February 2019 Hilary, who later became pope and dedicated an oratory in the Lateran Basilica in thanks for his life, managed to escape from Constantinople and brought news of the council to Leo who immediately dubbed it a synod of robbers — Latrocinium —and refused to accept its pronouncements. The decisions of this council now threatened schism between the East and the West.     The claims that bishops being forced to approve actions, were challenged by Pope Dioscorus and the Egyptian Bishops at Chalcedon.       The situation continued to deteriorate, with Leo demanding the convocation of a new council and Emperor Theodosius II refusing to budge, all the while appointing bishops in agreement with Dioscorus. All this changed dramatically with the Emperors death and the elevation of Marcian , an orthodox Christian, to the imperial throne. To resolve the simmering tensions, Marcian announced his intention to hold a new council to set aside the 449 Second Council of Ephesus which was named the Latrocinium Cross, F.L.; Livingstone, E.A., eds. . Latrocinium . The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church . Oxford: Oxford University Press or Robber Council by Pope Leo. Pulcheria , the sister of Theodosius, may have influenced this decision, or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar , the magister militum , to marry Marcian.     Leo had pressed for it to take place in Italy , but Emperor Marcian instead called for it to convene at Chalcedon, because it was closer to Constantinople, and would thus allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube, which was being raided by the Huns under Attila.     The council opened on October 8, 451. Marcian had the bishops deposed by Dioscorus returned to their dioceses and had the body of Flavian brought to the capital to be buried honorably. The Emperor asked Leo to preside over the council, but Leo again chose to send legates in his place. This time, Bishops Paschasinus of Lilybaeum and Julian of Cos and two priests Boniface and Basil represented the western church at the council. The council was attended by about 520 bishops or their representatives and was the largest and best-documented of the first seven ecumenical councils . All the sessions were held in the church of St. Euphemia, Martyr, outside the city and directly opposite Constantinople. As to the number of sessions held by the Council of Chalcedon there is a great discrepancy in the various texts of the Acts, also in the ancient historians of the council. Either the respective manuscripts must have been incomplete; or the historians passed over in silence several sessions held for secondary purposes. According to the deacon Rusticus, there were in all sixteen sessions; this division is commonly accepted by scholars, including Karl Josef von Hefele , an historian of the councils. If all the separate meetings were counted, there would be twenty-one sessions; several of these meetings, however, are considered as supplementary to preceding sessions.     Paschasinus refused to give Dioscorus a seat at the council. As a result, he was moved to the nave of the church. Paschasinus further ordered the reinstatement of Theodoret and that he be given a seat, but this move caused such an uproar among the council fathers, that Theodoret also sat in the nave, though he was given a vote in the proceedings, which began with a trial of Dioscorus.     Marcian wished to bring proceedings to a speedy end, and asked the council to make a pronouncement on the doctrine of the Incarnation before continuing the trial. The council fathers, however, felt that no new creed was necessary, and that the doctrine had been laid out clearly in Leos Tome. They were also hesitant to write a new creed as the First Council of Ephesus had forbidden the composition or use of any new creed. Aetius, deacon of Constantinople then read Cyrils letter to Nestorius, and a second letter to John of Antioch. The bishops responded, We all so believe: Pope Leo thus believes ... we all thus believe. As Cyril so believe we, all of us: eternal be the memory of Cyril: as the epistles of Cyril teach such is our mind, such has been our faith: such is our faith: this is the mind of Archbishop Leo, so he believes, so he has written.     Beronician, clerk of the consistory, then read from a book handed him by Aetius, the synodical letter of Leo to Flavian . After the reading of the letter, the bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. ...Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, ...This is the true faith...This is the faith of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus?     However, during the reading of Leos Tome, three passages were challenged as being potentially Nestorian, and their orthodoxy was defended by using the writings of Cyril. Due to such concerns, the council decided to adjourn and appoint a special committee to investigate the orthodoxy of Leos Tome, judging it by the standard of Cyrils Twelve Chapters, as some of the bishops present raised concerns about their compatibility. This committee was headed by Anatolius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and was given five days to carefully study the matter. The committee unanimously decided in favor of the orthodoxy of Leo, determining that what he said was compatible with the teaching of Cyril. A number of other bishops also entered statements to the effect that they believed that Leos Tome was not in contradiction with the teaching of Cyril as well.     The council continued with Dioscorus trial, but he refused to appear before the assembly. However, historical accounts from the Eastern Orthodox Church note that Dioscorus was put under solitary arrest. As a result, he was condemned, but by an underwhelming amount , and all of his decrees were declared null. Empress Pulcheria told Dioscorus In my fathers time, there was a man who was stubborn and you are aware of what was made of him , to which Dioscorus famously responded And you may recall that your mother prayed at his tomb, as she was bleeding of sickness . Pulcheria is said to have slapped Dioscorus in the face, breaking some of his teeth, and ordered the guards to confine him, which they did pulling his beard hair. Dioscorus is said to have put these in a box and sent them back to his Church in Alexandria noting this is the fruit of my faith History of the Coptic Church, Father Menassa Yuhanna . Marcian responded by exiling Dioscorus.     All of the bishops were then asked to sign their assent to the Tome, but a group of thirteen Egyptians refused, saying that they would assent to the traditional faith . As a result, the Emperors commissioners decided that a credo would indeed be necessary and presented a text to the fathers. No consensus was reached. Paschasinus threatened to return to Rome to reassemble the council in Italy. Marcian agreed, saying that if a clause were not added to the credo, the bishops would have to relocate. The Committee then sat in the oratory of the most holy martyr Euphemis and afterwards reported a definition of faith which while teaching the same doctrine was not the Tome of Leo.     Although it could be reconciled with Cyrils Formula of Reunion, it was not compatible in its wording with Cyrils Twelve Anathemas. In particular, the third anathema reads: If anyone divides in the one Christ the hypostases after the union, joining them only by a conjunction of dignity or authority or power, and not rather by a coming together in a union by nature, let him be anathema. This appeared to some to be incompatible with Leos definition of two natures hypostatically joined. However, the council would determine that this was an issue of wording and not of doctrine; a committee of bishops appointed to study the orthodoxy of the Tome using Cyrils letters as their criteria unanimously determined it to be orthodox, and the council, with few exceptions, supported this.     It approved the creed of Nicaea , the creed of Constantinople , two letters of Cyril against Nestorius, which insisted on the unity of divine and human persons in Christ, and the Tome of Pope Leo I confirming two distinct natures in Christ.       The dogmatic definition s of the council are recognized as normative by the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches, as well by certain other Western Churches ; also, most Protestants agree that the councils teachings regarding the Trinity and the Incarnation are orthodox doctrine which must be adhered to. The council, however, is rejected by the Assyrian Church of the East and the Oriental Orthodox Churches , the latter teaching rather that The Lord Jesus Christ is God the Incarnate Word . He possesses the perfect Godhead and the perfect manhood. His fully divine nature is united with His fully human nature yet without mixing, blending or alteration. The Oriental Orthodox contend that this latter teaching has been misunderstood as monophysitism , an appellation with which they strongly disagree but, nevertheless, refuse to accept the decrees of the council, likely as a result of the conduct and the proceedings of the Council. The Eastern Orthodox Churches have, and continue to view the Council as a power struggle by the Church of Rome, given the prominence in theology, spirituality of the Oriental Orthodox Churches in the Early Church and during the first ecumenical councils.     Many Anglican s and most Protestants consider it to be the last authoritative ecumenical council. These churches, along with Martin Luther , hold that both conscience and scripture preempt doctrinal councils and generally agree that the conclusions of later councils were unsupported by or contradictory to scripture.       The Council of Chalcedon issued the Chalcedonian Definition , which repudiated the notion of a single nature in Christ, and declared that he has two natures in one person and hypostasis . It also insisted on the completeness of his two natures: Godhead and manhood. The council also issued 27 disciplinary canons governing church administration and authority. In a further decree, later known as canon 28, the bishops declared that the See of Constantinople had the patriarchal status with equal privileges to the See of Rome . The canon in the original language can be seen here: https://earlychurchtexts.com/main/chalcedon/canons_of_chalcedon_03.shtml. English translation available here: https://earlychurchtexts.com/public/chalcedon_canons.htm Schwerin, Philip, p3, Leo believed that in him was the voice of Peter. The Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451 declared that Constantinople had the same patriarchal status as Rome , a statement with which Leo never agreed, and which he even tried to declare invalid. When Leo tried to reinstate a defrocked French bishop, St. Hilary who presided over the Gallican Church as Supreme Pontiff, told Leo to keep his Roman nose out of French affairs. Leo’s aspirations were strongly opposed, especially by the patriarch of Constantinople. Yet through him the papacy still gained some ground. No reference was made in Canon 28 to the bishops of Rome or Constantinople having their authority from being successors to Peter or Andrew respectively. Instead, the stated reasons in the actual text of the Canon that the episcopacy of these cities had been granted their status was the importance of these cities as major cities of the empire of the time.         The Confession of Chalcedon provides a clear statement on the two natures of Christ, human and divine:         The full text of the definition which reaffirms the decisions of the Council of Ephesus , the pre-eminence of the Creed of Nicea . It also canonises as authoritative two of Cyril of Alexandria s letters and the Tome of Leo written against Eutyches and sent to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople in 449.       The work of the council was completed by a series of 30 disciplinary canons the Ancient Epitome s of which are:   The canons of every Synod of the holy Fathers shall be observed.   Whoso buys or sells an ordination, down to a Prosmonarius, shall be in danger of losing his grade. Such shall also be the case with go-betweens, if they be clerics they shall be cut off from their rank, if laymen or monks, they shall be anathematized.   Those who assume the care of secular houses should be corrected, unless perchance the law called them to the administration of those not yet come of age, from which there is no exemption. Unless further their Bishop permits them to take care of orphans and widows.   Domestic oratories and monasteries are not to be erected contrary to the judgment of the bishop. Every monk must be subject to his bishop, and must not leave his house except at his suggestion. A slave, however, can not enter the monastic life without the consent of his master.   Those who go from city to city shall be subject to the canon law on the subject.   In Martyries and Monasteries ordinations are strictly forbidden. Should any one be ordained therein, his ordination shall be reputed of no effect.   If any cleric or monk arrogantly affects the military or any other dignity, let him be cursed.   Any clergyman in an almshouse or monastery must submit himself to the authority of the bishop of the city. But he who rebels against this let him pay the penalty.   Litigious clerics shall be punished according to canon, if they despise the episcopal and resort to the secular tribunal. When a cleric has a contention with a bishop let him wait till the synod sits, and if a bishop have a contention with his metropolitan let him carry the case to Constantinople.   No cleric shall be recorded on the clergy-list of the churches of two cities. But if he shall have strayed forth, let him be returned to his former place. But if he has been transferred, let him have no share in the affairs of his former church.   Let the poor who stand in need of help make their journey with letters pacificatory and not commendatory: For letters commendatory should only be given to those who are open to suspicion.   One province shall not be cut into two. Whoever shall do this shall be cast out of the episcopate. Such cities as are cut off by imperial rescript shall enjoy only the honour of having a bishop settled in them: but all the rights pertaining to the true metropolis shall be preserved.   No cleric shall be received to communion in another city without a letter commendatory.   A Cantor or Lector alien to the sound faith, if being then married, he shall have begotten children let him bring them to communion, if they had there been baptized. But if they had not yet been baptized they shall not be baptized afterwards by the heretics.   No person shall be ordained deaconess except she be forty years of age. If she shall dishonour her ministry by contracting a marriage, let her be anathema.   Monks or nuns shall not contract marriage, and if they do so let them be excommunicated.   Village and rural parishes if they have been possessed for thirty years, they shall so continue. But if within that time, the matter shall be subject to adjudication. But if by the command of the Emperor a city be renewed, the order of ecclesiastical parishes shall follow the civil and public forms.   Clerics and Monks, if they shall have dared to hold conventicles and to conspire against the bishop, shall be cast out of their rank.   Twice each year the Synod shall be held wherever the bishop of the Metropolis shall designate, and all matters of pressing interest shall be determined.   A clergyman of one city shall not be given a cure in another. But if he has been driven from his native place and shall go into another he shall be without blame. If any bishop receives clergymen from without his diocese he shall be excommunicated as well as the cleric he receives.   A cleric or layman making charges rashly against his bishop shall not be received.   Whoever seizes the goods of his deceased bishop shall be cast forth from his rank.   Clerics or monks who spend much time at Constantinople contrary to the will of their bishop, and stir up seditions, shall be cast out of the city.   A monastery erected with the consent of the bishop shall be immovable. And whatever pertains to it shall not be alienated. Whoever shall take upon him to do otherwise, shall not be held guiltless.   Let the ordination of bishops be within three months: necessity however may make the time longer. But if anyone shall ordain counter to this decree, he shall be liable to punishment. The revenue shall remain with the œconomus.   The œconomus in all churches must be chosen from the clergy. And the bishop who neglects to do this is not without blame.   If a clergyman elope with a woman, let him be expelled from the Church. If a layman, let him be anathema. The same shall be the lot of any that assist him.   The bishop of New Rome shall enjoy the same privileges as the bishop of Old Rome, on account of the removal of the Empire. For this reason the of Pontus, of Asia, and of Thrace, as well as the Barbarian bishops shall be ordained by the bishop of Constantinople.   He is sacrilegious who degrades a bishop to the rank of a presbyter. For he that is guilty of crime is unworthy of the priesthood. But he that was deposed without cause, let him be bishop.   It is the custom of the Egyptians that none subscribe without the permission of their Archbishop. Wherefore they are not to be blamed who did not subscribe the Epistle of the holy Leo until an Archbishop had been appointed for them.     Canon 28 grants equal privileges  to Constantinople as of Rome because Constantinople is the New Rome as renewed by canon 36 of the Quinisext Council . Pope Leo declared the canon 28 null and void and only approved the canons of the council which were pertaining to faith. Migne, Jacquies Paul, 1038 & 1143 The “Holy, Great and Universal Council” simply addressed the bishop of Rome as Archbishop Leo . Migne, Jacquies Paul, 951     According to some ancient Greek collections, canons 29 and 30 are attributed to the council: canon 29, which states that an unworthy bishop cannot be demoted but can be removed, is an extract from the minutes of the 19th session; canon 30, which grants the Egyptians time to consider their rejection of Leos Tome, is an extract from the minutes of the fourth session. The Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, Vol. 1, ed. Norman P. Tanner, S.J. , 75–76.     In all likelihood an official record of the proceedings was made either during the council itself or shortly afterwards. The assembled bishops informed the pope that a copy of all the Acta would be transmitted to him; in March, 453, Pope Leo commissioned Julian of Cos, then at Constantinople, to make a collection of all the Acts and translate them into Latin. Most of the documents, chiefly the minutes of the sessions, were written in Greek; others, e.g. the imperial letters, were issued in both languages; others, again, e.g. the papal letters, were written in Latin. Eventually nearly all of them were translated into both languages.             The metropolitan of Jerusalem was given independence from the metropolitan of Antioch and from any other higher-ranking bishop, given what is now known as autocephaly , in the councils seventh session whose Decree on the Jurisdiction of Jerusalem and Antioch contains: the bishop of Jerusalem, or rather the most holy Church which is under him, shall have under his own power the three Palestines . This led to Jerusalem becoming a patriarch ate, one of the five patriarchates known as the pentarchy , when the title of patriarch was created in 531 by Justinian . The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, s.v. patriarch , also calls it a title dating from the 6th century, for the bishops of the five great sees of Christendom . Merriam-Websters Encyclopedia of World Religions, says: Five patriarchates, collectively called the pentarchy, were the first to be recognized by the legislation of the emperor Justinian .       In a canon of disputed validity, the Council of Chalcedon also elevated the See of Constantinople to a position second in eminence and power to the Bishop of Rome .     The Council of Nicaea in 325 had noted that the Sees of Alexandria , Antioch , and Rome should have primacy over other, lesser dioceses. At the time, the See of Constantinople was not yet of ecclesiastical prominence, but its proximity to the Imperial court gave rise to its importance. The Council of Constantinople in 381 modified the situation somewhat by placing Constantinople second in honor, above Alexandria and Antioch, stating in Canon III, that the bishop of Constantinople... shall have the prerogative of honor after the bishop of Rome; because Constantinople is New Rome . In the early 5th century, this status was challenged by the bishops of Alexandria, but the Council of Chalcedon confirmed in Canon XXVIII:       In making their case, the council fathers argued that tradition had accorded honor to the see of older Rome because it was the first imperial city. Accordingly, moved by the same purposes the fathers apportioned equal prerogatives to the most holy see of new Rome because the city which is honored by the imperial power and senate and enjoying privileges equaling older imperial Rome should also be elevated to her level in ecclesiastical affairs and take second place after her . Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, ed. Norman P. Tanner, SJ, 99–100. The framework for allocating ecclesiastical authority advocated by the council fathers mirrored the allocation of imperial authority in the later period of the Roman Empire . The Eastern position could be characterized as being political in nature, as opposed to a doctrinal view. In practice, all Christians East and West addressed the papacy as the See of Peter and Paul or the Apostolic See rather than the See of the Imperial Capital. Rome understands this to indicate that its precedence has always come from its direct lineage from the apostles Peter and Paul rather than its association with Imperial authority.     After the passage of the Canon 28, Rome filed a protest against the reduction of honor given to Antioch and Alexandria. However, fearing that withholding Romes approval would be interpreted as a rejection of the entire council, in 453 the pope confirmed the councils canons with a protest against the 28th.       The near-immediate result of the council was a major schism. The bishops that were uneasy with the language of Pope Leos Tome repudiated the council, saying that the acceptance of two physes was tantamount to Nestorianism. Dioscorus of Alexandria advocated miaphysitism and had dominated the Council of Ephesus. Latrocinium. Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 Churches that rejected Chalcedon in favor of Ephesus broke off from the rest of the Eastern Church in a schism, the most significant among these being the Church of Alexandria , today known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria . See drop-down essay on Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire The rise of the so-called Monophysitism in the East was led by the Copts of Egypt. This must be regarded as the outward expression of the growing nationalist trends in that province against the gradual intensification of Byzantine imperialism, soon to reach its consummation during the reign of Emperor Justinian.   A significant effect on the Orthodox Christians in Egypt, was a series of persecutions by the Roman empire forcing followers of the Eastern Orthodox Church to claim allegiance to Leos Tome, or Chalcedon. This led to the martyrdom, persecution and death of thousands of Egyptian saints and bishops till the Arab Conquest of Egypt. As a result, The Council of Chalcedon is referred to as Chalcedon, the Omnious among Coptic Egyptians given how it led to Christians persecuting other Christians for the first time in history. Coptic Orthodox Christians continue to distinguish themselves from followers of Chalcedon to this day. Although the theological differences are seen as limited , it is politics, the subsequent persecutions and the power struggles of a rising Roman Empire, that may have led to the Great Schism, or at least contributed significantly to amplifying it through the centuries.     Justinian I attempted to bring those monks who still rejected the decision of the Council of Chalcedon into communion with the greater church. The exact time of this event is unknown, but it is believed to have been between 535 and 548. St Abraham of Farshut was summoned to Constantinople and he chose to bring with him four monks. Upon arrival, Justinian summoned them and informed them that they would either accept the decision of the council or lose their positions. Abraham refused to entertain the idea. Theodora tried to persuade Justinian to change his mind, seemingly to no avail. Abraham himself stated in a letter to his monks that he preferred to remain in exile rather than subscribe to a faith contrary to that of Athanasius . They were not alone, and the non-Chalcedon churches compose Oriental Orthodoxy , with the Church of Alexandria as their primus inter pares . Only in recent years has a degree of rapprochement between Chalcedonian Christians and the Oriental Orthodox been seen.       Several Oriental Orthodox Church historians have viewed the Council as a dispute with the Church of Rome over precedence among the various patriarchal sees. Coptic sources both in Coptic and in Arabic, suggest that questions of political and ecclesiastical authority exaggerated differences between the two professions of faith.     The Copts consistently repudiate the Western identification of Alexandrine Christianity with the Eutychianism which originated in Constantinople and which they have always regarded as a flagrant heresy since it declared the complete absorption of Christs manhood in his single divine nature whereas the Copts clearly upheld the doctrine of the two natures, divine and human - mystically united in one without confusion, corruption, or change. As a strictly traditional church, its religious leaders have sought biblical justification for this interpretation of the Nicean Creed and the Cyrilian formula, but meanwhile have restricted the substance of their variance to interpretation.       The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates the Holy Fathers of the 4th Ecumenical Council, who assembled in Chalcedon on the Sunday on or after July 13;     however, in some places  on that date is rather a feast of the Fathers of the First Six Ecumenical Councils.     For both of the above complete propers have been composed and are found in the Menaion .     For the former The Office of the 630 Holy and God-bearing Fathers of the 4th ... Summoned against the Monophysites Eftyches and Dioskoros ... was composed in the middle of the 14th century by Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople . This contains numerous hymns exposing the councils teaching, commemorating its leaders whom it praises and whose prayers it implores, and naming its opponents pejoratively. e.g.\n",
      " is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.  Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals by Gregorio Billikopf , University of California       Disputes involving neighbors often have no official resolution mechanism. Community mediation centers generally focus on neighborhood conflict, with trained local volunteers serving as mediators. Such organizations often serve populations that cannot afford to utilize the courts or professional ADR-providers. Community programs typically provide mediation for disputes between landlords and tenants, members of homeowners associations and small businesses and consumers. Many community programs offer their services for free or at a nominal fee.     Experimental community mediation programs using volunteer mediators began in the early 1970s in several major U.S. cities. These proved to be so successful that hundreds of programs were founded throughout the country in the following two decades. In some jurisdictions, such as California, the parties have the option of making their agreement enforceable in court.     In Australia mediation was incorporated extensively into family law Family Law Act 1975 and the 2006 Amendments Mandatory, http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2006A00046 subject to certain exceptions, Family Dispute Resolution Mediation is required before courts will consider disputed parenting arrangements. The Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners who provide this service are accredited by the Attorney-Generals Department. http://www.ag.gov.au/FamiliesAndMarriage/Families/FamilyDisputeResolution/Pages/default.aspx       A peer mediator is one who resembles the disputants, such as being of similar age, attending the same school or having similar status in a business. Purportedly, peers can better relate to the disputants than an outsider.     Peer mediation promotes social cohesion and aids development of protective factors that create positive school climates. The National Healthy School Standard highlighted the significance of this approach to reducing bullying and promoting pupil achievement. Schools adopting this process recruit and train interested students to prepare them.     Peace Pals is an empirically validated peer mediation program. The programs creator is Dr. Rita Schellenberg, counselor educator, counselor supervisor, and licensed school counselor. was studied over a 5-year period and revealed several positive outcomes including a reduction in elementary school violence and enhanced social skills, while creating a more positive, peaceful school climate.     Peer mediation helped reduce crime in schools, saved counselor and administrator time, enhanced self-esteem, improved attendance and encouraged development of leadership and problem-solving skills among students. Such conflict resolution programs increased in U.S. schools 40% between 1991 and 1999. Gerber, S 1999, Does peer mediation really work?, Professional School Counseling, 2, 3, 169     Peace Pals was studied in a diverse, suburban elementary school. Peer mediation was available to all students . Significant and long-term reductions in school-wide violence over a five-year period occurred. The reductions included both verbal and physical conflict. Mediator knowledge made significant gains pertaining to conflict, conflict resolution and mediation, which was maintained at 3-month follow-up. Additionally, mediators and participants viewed the Peace Pals program as effective and valuable, and all mediation sessions resulted in successful resolution.       The commercial domain remains the most common application of mediation, as measured by number of mediators and the total exchanged value. The result of business mediation is typically a bilateral contract .     Commercial mediation includes work in finance , insurance , ship-brokering , procurement and real estate . In some areas, mediators have specialized designations and typically operate under special laws. Generally, mediators cannot themselves practice commerce in markets for goods in which they work as mediators.     Procurement mediation comprises disputes between a public body and a private body. In common law jurisdictions only regulatory stipulations on creation of supply contracts that derive from the fields of State Aids or general administrative guidelines extend ordinary laws of commerce. The general law of contract applies in the UK accordingly. Procurement mediation occurs in circumstances after creation of the contract where a dispute arises in regard to the performance or payments. A Procurement mediator in the UK may choose to specialise in this type of contract or a public body may appoint an individual to a specific mediation panel.       In response to the Mabo decision, the Australian Government sought to engage the population and industry on Mabos implications for land tenure and use by enacting the Native Title Act 1993 , which required mediation as a mechanism to determine future native title rights. The process incorporated the Federal Court and the National Native Title Tribunal . Mediation can occur in parallel with legal challenges, such as occurred in Perth.     Some features of native title mediation that distinguish it from other forms include lengthy time frames, the number of parties and that statutory and case law prescriptions constrain some aspects of the negotiations.       Mediations effectiveness in trans-border disputes has been questioned, but an understanding of fundamental mediation principles points to the unlimited potential of mediation in such disputes. Mediators explicitly address and manage cultural and language differences in detail during the process. Voluntary referral to mediation is not required—much mediation to reach the table through binding contractual provisions, statutes, treaties, or international agreements and accords. The principle of voluntariness applies to the right of parties to self-determination once they are in the mediation—not to the mechanism for initiating the mediation process. Much mediation also results form mutual consent because they are non-binding and they encourage the exploration of interests and mutual benefits of an agreement. Because the parties, themselves, create the terms of agreement, compliance with mediated settlement agreements is relatively high. Any compliance or implementation issues can be addressed by follow-up mediation, regular compliance monitoring, and other processes.         Since the early 1980s a number of institutions in South Africa have championed mediation. The Independent Mediation Service of South Africa was established in 1984. It trained mediators who then worked through Local Dispute Resolution Committees set up as part of the National Peace Accord . Initial training was undertaken by the UKs ACAS. IMSSA covers mediation within unionised environments. The more recently created Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration was formed as result of the Labour Relation Act No 66 1995, and replaced the Industrial Courts in handling large areas of employment disputes.     Informal processes that engage a community in more holistic solution-finding are growing.     After 1995, the country established a legal right to take an employment dispute to conciliation/mediation. Mediation agreements are binding in law. The process has grown from generally covering collective agreements such as for wages or terms and conditions, to encompass more individual matters including dismissal.               The mediators primary role is to act as a neutral third party who facilitates discussions between the parties. In addition, a mediator serves in an evaluative role when they analyze, assess the issues, and engage in reality-testing. A mediator is neutral and they are not the agent of any party. In their role, mediators do not offer prescriptive advice . Mediators also manage the interaction between the parties and encourage constructive communication through the use of specialized communication techniques.     Finally, the mediator should restrict pressure, aggression and intimidation, demonstrate how to communicate through employing good speaking and listening skills, and paying attention to non-verbal messages and other signals emanating from the context of the mediation and possibly contributing expertise and experience. The mediator should direct the parties to focus on issues and stay away from personal attacks.       The role of the parties varies according to their motivations and skills, the role of legal advisers, the model of mediation, the style of mediator and the culture in which the mediation takes place. Legal requirements may also affect their roles. In New South Wales the Law Society has published A guide to the rights and Responsibilities of participants. Party-directed mediation is an emerging approach involving a pre-caucus between the mediator and each of the parties before going into the joint session. The idea is to help the parties improve their interpersonal negotiation skills so that in the joint session they can address each other with little mediator interference. , by Gregorio Billikopf , University of California. , from Internet Archive       The parties first role is to consent to mediation, possibly before preparatory activities commence. Parties then prepare in much the same way they would for other varieties of negotiations. Parties may provide position statements, valuation reports and risk assessment analysis. The mediator may supervise/facilitate their preparation and may require certain preparations.       Mediation requires direct input from the parties. Parties must attend and participate in the mediation meeting. Some mediation rules require parties to attend in person. Participation at one stage may compensate for absence at another stage.       Choose an appropriate mediator, considering experience, skills, credibility, cost, etc. The criteria for mediator competence is under dispute. Competence certainly includes the ability to remain neutral and to move parties though various impasse-points in a dispute. The dispute is over whether expertise in the subject matter of the dispute should be considered or is actually detrimental to the mediators objectivity.     Preparatory steps for mediation can vary according to legal and other requirements, not least gaining the willingness of the parties to participate. To assist parties in preparing for commercial mediations, particularly in cross-border disputes where there can be very different understandings of the word mediation and the mediation process, the International Mediation Institute has posted an online evaluation form , which is designed to be used by parties working together with their counsel.     In some court-connected mediation programs, courts require disputants to prepare for mediation by making a statement or summary of the subject of the dispute and then bringing the summary to the mediation. In other cases, determining the matter at issue can become part of the mediation itself.     Consider having the mediator meet the disputants prior to the mediation meeting. This can reduce anxiety, improve settlement odds and increase satisfaction with the mediation process. Zutter, Deborah. Preliminary Mediation Practices. Bond University, Australia: Unpublished Thesis, 2004.     Ensure that all participants are ready to discuss the dispute in a reasonably objective fashion. Readiness is improved when disputants consider the viability of various outcomes.     Provide reasonable estimates of loss and/or damage.     Identify other participants. In addition to the disputants and the mediator, the process may benefit from the presence of counsel, subject-matter experts, interpreters, family, etc.     Secure a venue for each mediation session. The venue must foster the discussion, address any special needs, protect privacy and allow ample discussion time.     Ensure that supporting information such as pictures, documents, corporate records, pay-stubs, rent-rolls, receipts, medical reports, bank-statements, etc., are available.     Have parties sign a contract that addresses procedural decisions, including confidentiality, mediator payment, communication technique, etc.       The typical mediation has no formal compulsory elements, although some elements usually occur:     establishment of ground rules framing the boundaries of mediation   parties detail their stories   identification of issues   identify options   discuss and analyze solutions   adjust and refine proposed solutions   record agreement in writing     Individual mediators vary these steps to match specific circumstances, given that the law does not ordinarily govern mediators methods.             Ratification and review provide safeguards for mediating parties. They also provide an opportunity for persons not privy to the mediation to undermine the result.   Some mediated agreements require ratification by an external body—such as a board, council or cabinet. In some situations the sanctions of a court or other external authority must explicitly endorse a mediation agreement. Thus if a grandparent or other non-parent is granted residence rights in a family dispute, a court counselor will be required to furnish a report to the court on merits of the proposed agreement to aid the courts ultimate disposition of the case.   In other situations it may be agreed to have agreements reviewed by lawyers, accountants or other professional advisers.     The implementation of mediated agreements must comply with the statues and regulations of the governing jurisdiction.     Parties to a private mediation may also wish to obtain court sanction for their decisions. Under the Queensland regulatory scheme on court connected mediation, mediators are required to file with a registrar a certificate about the mediation in a form prescribed in the regulations. A party may subsequently apply to a relevant court an order giving effect to the agreement reached. Where court sanction is not obtained, mediated settlements have the same status as any other agreements.       Mediators may at their discretion refer one or more parties to psychologists, accountants, social workers or others for post-mediation professional assistance.       In some situations, a post-mediation debriefing and feedback session is conducted between co-mediators or between mediators and supervisors. It involves a reflective analysis and evaluation of the process. In many community mediation services debriefing is compulsory and mediators are paid for the debriefing session.       Mediation recognised that in addition to the fact of reaching a settlement, party satisfaction and mediator competence could be measured. Surveys of mediation parties reveal strong levels of satisfaction with the process. Of course, if parties are generally satisfied post-settlement, then such measures may not be particularly explanatory.           The educational requirements for accreditation as a mediator differ between accrediting groups and from country to country. In some cases legislation mandates requirements; in others professional bodies impose accreditation standards. Many US universities offer graduate studies in mediation, such as the       In Australia , for example, professionals wanting to practice in the area of family law must have tertiary qualifications in law or in social science, undertake 5 days training in mediation and engage in 10 hours of supervised mediation. Furthermore, they must also undertake 12 hours of education or training every 12 months.     Other institutions offer units in mediation across a number of disciplines such as law, social science, business and the humanities. Not all kinds of mediation-work require academic qualifications, as some deal more with practical skills than with theoretical knowledge. Membership organizations provide training courses. Internationally a similar approach to the training of mediators is taken by organizations such as the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution , CEDR. Based in London, it has trained over 5000 CEDR mediators from different countries to date. https://www.cedr.com/docslib/2009_Achievements_at_CEDR3.pdf     No legislated national standards on the level of education apply to all practitioners organizations. However, organizations such as the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council advocate for a wide scope on such issues. Other systems apply in other jurisdictions such as Germany, which advocates a higher level of educational qualification for practitioners of mediation.       Common elements of codes of conduct include:     informing participants as to the process of mediation   adopting a neutral stance   revealing any potential conflicts of interest   maintaining confidentiality within the bounds of the law   mindfulness of the psychological and physical wellbeing of all participants   directing participants to appropriate sources for legal advice   engaging in ongoing training   practising only in those fields in which they have expertise.       In Australia mediation codes of conduct include those developed by the Law Societies of South Australia and Western Australia and those developed by organisations such as Institute of Arbitrators & Mediators Australia and LEADR. The CPR/Georgetown Ethics Commission, the Mediation Forum of the Union International des Avocats, and the European Commission have promulgated codes of conduct for mediators.       In Canada codes of conduct for mediators are set by professional organizations. In Ontario three distinct professional organizations maintain codes of conduct for mediators. The Family Dispute Resolution Institute of Ontario and the Ontario Association of Family Mediators set standards for their members who mediate family matters and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Institute of Ontario who sets standards for their members.     The Alternative Dispute Resolution Institute of Ontario, a regional affiliate of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Institute of Canada, uses the code of conduct from the federal organization to regulate the conduct of its members. The Codes three objectives are to provide guiding principles for the conduct of mediators; to promote confidence in mediation as a process for resolving disputes; and to provide protection for members of the public who use mediators who are members of the institute.       In France, professional mediators have created an organization to develop a rational approach to conflict resolution. This approach is based on a scientific definition of a person and a conflict. These definitions help to develop a structured mediation process. Mediators have adopted a code of ethics which guarantees professionalism. Pratique de la médiation professionnelle, Jean-Louis Lascoux, ESF Sciences Humaines, 2001-2017. Code de la Médiation pour lorientation de la médiation, Agnès Tavel, Médiateurs Editeurs, 2009. Dictionnaire encyclopédique de la Médiation au service de la qualité relationnelle et de lEntente Sociale, Jean-Louis Lascoux, ESF Sciences Humaines, 2019.       In Germany, due to the Mediation Act of 2012, mediation as a process and the responsibilities of a mediator are legally defined. Based on the German language and the specific codification one has to take into account, that all persons who mediate in a conflict are tied to the provisions of the Mediation Act even if they call their approach/process not mediation but facilitation , conciliation , conflict counseling , consulting , conflict coaching or what so ever.   For example, according to sec. 2 and sec. 3 of the German Mediation Act, the mediator has certain information and disclosure obligations as well as limittions of practice. In particular, a person who has been in any form of counseling role to a party in this matter is not allowed to act as a mediator in the case .           A range of organizations within Australia accredit mediators. Standards vary according to the specific mediation and the level of specificity that is desired. Standards apply to particular ADR processes.     The National Mediator Accreditation System commenced operation on 1 January 2008. It is an industry-based scheme which relies on voluntary compliance by mediator organisations that agree to accredit mediators in accordance with the requisite standards.     Mediator organizations have varying ideals of what makes a good mediator which reflect the training and accreditation of that particular organization. Australia did not adopt a national accreditation system, which may lead to suboptimal choice of mediators.       According to sec. 6 German Mediation Act the German government on June 21, 2016 has released the German regulation about education and training of the so-called certified mediators which from Sept. 1, 2017 postulates a minimum of 120 hours of initial specialized mediator training as well as case supervision and further ongoing training of 40 hours within 4 years. Beyond this basic qualification, the leading mediation associations have agreed on quality standards higher than the minimum standards of the national regulation to certify their mediators. To become an accredited mediator of these associations one has to complete an accredited mediation training program of a minimum of 200 hours incl. 30 hours of supervision as well as ongoing training .           Mediator selection is of practical significance given varying models of mediation, mediators discretion in structuring the process and the impact of the mediators professional background and personal style on the result.     In community mediation programs the director generally assigns mediators. In New South Wales, for example, when the parties cannot agree on a mediator, the registrar contacts a nominating entity, such as the Bar Association which supplies the name of a qualified and experienced mediator.     As of 2006, formal mechanisms for objecting to the appointment of a particular mediator had not been established. Parties could ask the mediator to withdraw for reasons of conflict of interest . In some cases, legislation establishes criteria for mediators. In New South Wales, for example, the Family Law Act 1975 proscribes qualifications for mediators.       The following are useful criteria for selecting a mediator:   Personal attributes & mdash;patience, empathy, intelligence, optimism and flexibility   Qualifications & mdash;knowledge of the theory and practice of conflict, negotiation and mediation, mediation skills.   Experience & mdash; mediation experience, experience in the substantive area of dispute and personal life experience   Training   Professional background   Certification and its value   Suitability of the mediation model   Disclosure of potential Conflicts of Interest   Cost/fee       Contracts that specify mediation may also specify a third party to suggest or impose an individual. Some third parties simply maintain a list of approved individuals, while others train mediators. Lists may be open or a closed panel .     In the UK and internationally, lists are generally open, such as The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators , the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution . Alternatively, private panels co-exist and compete for appointments e.g., Savills Mediation.       Legal liability may stem from a mediation. For example, a mediator could be liable for misleading the parties or for even inadvertently breaching confidentiality. Despite such risks, follow-on court action is quite uncommon. Only one case reached that stage in Australia as of 2006. Damage awards are generally compensatory in nature. Proper training is mediators best protection.     Liability can arise for the mediator from Liability in Contract; Liability in Tort; and Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Obligations.     Liability in Contract arises if a mediator breaches contract with one or more parties. The two forms of breach are failure to perform and anticipatory breach. Limitations on liability include the requirement to show actual causation.     Liability in Tort arises if a mediator influences a party in any way , defames a party, breaches confidentiality, or most commonly, is negligent. To be awarded damages, the party must show actual damage, and must show that the mediators actions were the actual cause of the damage.     Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Obligations can occur if parties misconceive their relationship with a mediator as something other than neutrality. Since such liability relies on a misconception, court action is unlikely to succeed.       As of 2008 Tapoohi v Lewenberg was the only case in Australia that set a precedent for mediators liability.     The case involved two sisters who settled an estate via mediation. Only one sister attended the mediation in person: the other participated via telephone with her lawyers present. An agreement was executed. At the time it was orally expressed that before the final settlement, taxation advice should be sought as such a large transfer of property would trigger capital gain s taxes.     Tapoohi paid Lewenberg $1.4 million in exchange for land. One year later, when Tapoohi realized that taxes were owed, she sued her sister, lawyers and the mediator based on the fact that the agreement was subject to further taxation advice.     The original agreement was verbal, without any formal agreement. Tapoohi, a lawyer herself, alleged that the mediator breached his contractual duty, given the lack of any formal agreement; and further alleged tortious breaches of his duty of care.     Although the court dismissed the summary judgment request, the case established that mediators owe a duty of care to parties and that parties can hold them liable for breaching that duty of care. Habersberger J held it not beyond argument that the mediator could be in breach of contractual and tortious duties. Such claims were required to be assessed at a trial court hearing.     This case emphasized the need for formal mediation agreements, including clauses that limit mediators liability.       Within the United States, the laws governing mediation vary by state. Some states have clear expectations for certification, ethical standards and confidentiality. Some also exempt mediators from testifying in cases theyve worked on. However, such laws only cover activity within the court system. Community and commercial mediators practising outside the court system may not have such legal protections. State laws regarding lawyers may differ widely from those that cover mediators. Professional mediators often consider the option of liability insurance .           Evaluative mediation is focused on providing the parties with an evaluation of their case and directing them toward settlement. During an evaluative mediation process, when the parties agree that the mediator should do so, the mediator will express a view on what might be a fair or reasonable settlement. The Evaluative mediator has somewhat of an advisory role in that s/he evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each sides argument and makes some predictions about what would happen should they go to court. Facilitative and transformative mediators do not evaluate arguments or direct the parties to a particular settlement.     In Germany, due to national regulation evaluative mediation is seen as an oxymoron and not allowed by the German mediation Act. Therefore, in Germany mediation is purly facilitative.       Facilitative mediators typically do not evaluate a case or direct the parties to a particular settlement. Instead, the Facilitative mediator facilitates the conversation. These mediators act as guardian of the process, not the content or the outcome. During a facilitative mediation session the parties in dispute control both what will be discussed and how their issues will be resolved. Unlike the transformative mediator, the facilitative mediator is focused on helping the parties find a resolution to their dispute and to that end, the facilitative mediator provides a structure and agenda for the discussion.         Transformative mediation looks at conflict as a crisis in communication. Success is not measured by settlement but by the parties shifts toward personal strength, interpersonal responsiveness, constructive interaction, new understandings of themselves and their situation, critically examining the possibilities, feeling better about each other, and making their own decisions. Those decisions can include settlement agreements or not. Transformative mediation practice is focused on supporting empowerment and recognition shifts, by allowing and encouraging deliberation, decision-making, and perspective-taking. A competent transformative mediator practices with a microfocus on communication, identifying opportunities for empowerment and recognition as those opportunities appear in the parties own conversations, and responding in ways that provide an opening for parties to choose what, if anything, to do with them.       The narrative approach to mediation shares with narrative therapy an emphasis on constructing stories as a basic human activity in understanding our lives and conflict. This approach emphasizes the sociological/psychological nature of conflict-saturated narratives, and values human creativity in acting and reacting to these narratives. The narrative metaphor draws attention to the ways in which we use stories to make sense of our lives and our relationship. Narrative mediation advocates changing the way we speak about conflicts. In objectifying the conflict narrative, participants become less attached to the problem and more creative in seeking solutions. The person is not the problem; the problem is the problem according to narrative mediation.       Mediation has sometimes been utilized to good effect when coupled with arbitration , particularly binding arbitration , in a process called mediation/arbitration. The process begins as a standard mediation, but if mediation fails, the mediator becomes an arbiter.     This process is more appropriate in civil matters where rules of evidence or jurisdiction are not in dispute. It resembles, in some respects, criminal plea-bargaining and Confucian judicial procedure, wherein the judge also plays the role of prosecutor —rendering what, in Western European court procedures, would be considered an arbitral decision.     Mediation/arbitration hybrids can pose significant ethical and process problems for mediators. Many of the options and successes of mediation relate to the mediators unique role as someone who wields no coercive power over the parties or the outcome. The parties awareness that the mediator might later act in the role of judge could distort the process. Using a different individual as the arbiter addresses this concern.         Online mediation employs online technology to provide disputants access to mediators and each other despite geographic distance, disability or other barriers to direct meeting. Online approaches also facilitate mediation when the value of the dispute does not justify the cost of face-to-face contact. Online mediation can also combine with face-to-face mediation—to allow mediation to begin sooner and/or to conduct preliminary discussions.       Neutral mediators enter into a conflict with the main intention in ending a conflict. This goal tends to hasten a mediator to reach a conclusion. Biased mediators enter into a conflict with specific biases in favor of one party or another. Biased mediators look to protect their parties interest thus leading to a better, more lasting resolution.       Mediation is one of several approaches to resolving disputes. It differs from adversarial resolution processes by virtue of its simplicity, informality, flexibility, and economy. Mediation provides the opportunity for parties to agree terms and resolve issues by themselves, without the need for legal representation or court hearings.     Not all disputes lend themselves well to mediation. Success is unlikely unless: The International Mediation Institute has a decision tree on its website, which is designed to help the parties to jointly select the most suitable mediator out of several neutrals who have all achieved certain level of professional competency.   All parties are ready and willing to participate.   All parties have legal representation. Mediation includes no right to legal counsel.   All parties are of legal age and are legally competent to make decisions.       Conciliation sometimes serves as an umbrella term that covers mediation and facilitative and advisory dispute-resolution processes. Simkin, W. E., ; Mediation and the Dynamics of Collective Bargaining; Bureau of National Affairs Books, Washington DC, Neither process determines an outcome, and both share many similarities. For example, both processes involve a neutral third-party who has no enforcing powers.     One significant difference between conciliation and mediation lies in the fact that conciliators possess expert knowledge of the domain in which they conciliate. The conciliator can make suggestions for settlement terms and can give advice on the subject-matter. Conciliators may also use their role to actively encourage the parties to come to a resolution. In certain types of dispute the conciliator has a duty to provide legal information. This helps ensure that agreements comply with relevant statutory frameworks. Therefore, conciliation may include an advisory aspect.     Mediation is purely facilitative: the mediator has no advisory role. Instead, a mediator seeks to help parties to develop a shared understanding of the conflict and to work toward building a practical and lasting resolution. retrieved 2007-11-24     Both mediation and conciliation work to identify the disputed issues and to generate options that help disputants reach a mutually satisfactory resolution. They both offer relatively flexible processes. Any settlement reached generally must have the agreement of all parties. This contrasts with litigation , which normally settles the dispute in favour of the party with the strongest legal argument. In-between the two operates collaborative law , which uses a facilitative process where each party has counsel .       A counsellor generally uses therapeutic techniques. Some & mdash;such as a particular line of questioning & mdash;may be useful in mediation. But the role of the counsellor differs from the role of the mediator. The list below is not exhaustive but it gives an indication of important distinctions:     A mediator aims for clear agreement between the participants as to how they will deal with specific issues. A counsellor is more concerned with the parties gaining a better self-understanding of their individual behaviour.   A mediator, while acknowledging a persons feelings, does not explore them in any depth. A counsellor is fundamentally concerned about how people feel about a range of relevant experiences.   A mediator focuses upon participants future goals rather than a detailed analysis of past events. A counsellor may find it necessary to explore the past in detail to expose the origins and patterns of beliefs and behaviour.   A mediator controls the process but does not overtly try to influence the participants or the actual outcome. A counsellor often takes an intentional role in the process, seeking to influence the parties to move in a particular direction or consider specific issues.   A mediator relies on all parties being present to negotiate, usually face-to-face. A counsellor does not necessarily see all parties at the same time.   A mediator is required to be neutral. A counsellor may play a more supportive role, where appropriate.   Mediation requires both parties to be willing to negotiate. Counselling may work with one party even if the other is not ready or willing to participate.   Mediation is a structured process that typically completes in one or a few sessions. Counselling tends to be ongoing, depending upon participants needs and progress.       The technique of early neutral evaluation\n",

      ":     : S \\langle P_2 \\rangle \\left \\langle \\frac \\right \\rangle     where \\theta is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the local director . The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, S    0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, S is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.  The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, \n",
      " can be used to determine S.     The order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials . These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.     A positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the z-axis the density \\rho is often given by:     : \\rho \\rho \\rho_0 + \\rho_1\\cos + \\cdots \\,     The complex positional order parameter is defined as \\psi \\rho_1 e^ and \\rho_0 the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic \\psi 0 and for a smectic phase \\psi will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.          A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by \n",
      " and the second order parameter is given by:     : \\sigma \\left\\langle\\cos\\left\\left\\right\\rangle     The values z i , θ i , and d are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:     : U_i -U_0\\left\\left     Here constant α quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.       In this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the \n",
      ". One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; splay of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and bend of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices  and lipid bilayers.        Scientists and engineers are able to use liquid crystals in a variety of applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.       The ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.      Even if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.     The response of any system to an external electrical field is     : D_i \\epsilon_0 E_i + P_i     Where E , D and P are the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is     : f_\\text -\\frac D_i \\cdot E_i     In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend on the linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of n .

In particular that implies that the orbit length is a divisor of the group order.     : Example: Let G be a group of prime order p acting on a set X with k elements. Since each orbit has either 1 or p elements, we have at least k \\bmod p orbits of length 1 which are G-invariant elements.     This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments .        : Example: One can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem to count the automorphisms of a \n",
      " group. Then G acts on the set of vertices , and this action is transitive as can be seen by composing rotations about the center of the cube. Thus, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we have that |G| |G\\cdot1||G_1| 8|G_1| . Applying the theorem now to the stabilizer G 1 , we obtain |G_1| |\\cdot2||_2| . Any element of G that fixes 1 must send 2 to either 2, 4, or 5. As an example of such automorphisms consider the rotation around the diagonal axis through 1 and 7 by 2\\pi/3 which permutes 2,4,5 and 3,6,8, and fixes 1 and 7. Thus, \\left|\\cdot2\\right| 3 . Applying the theorem a third time gives |_2| |\\cdot3||_3| . Any element of G that fixes 1 and 2 must send 3 to either 3 or 6. Reflecting the cube at the plane through 1,2,7 and 8 is such an automorphism sending 3 to 6, thus \\left|\\cdot3\\right| 2 . One also sees that _3 consists only of the identity automorphism, as any element of G fixing 1, 2 and 3 must also fix all other vertices, since they are determined by their adjacency to 1, 2 and 3. Combining the preceding calculations, we now obtain |G| 8\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1 48 .     A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is \n",

Fixing a group G, the set of formal differences of finite G-sets forms a \n",

Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known . However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers .     A tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern proved an Ω lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes .

Due to the large number of calculations, a work in progress is usually only rendered in detail appropriate to the portion of the work being developed at a given time, so in the initial stages of modeling, wireframe and ray casting may be used, even where the target output is ray tracing with radiosity. It is also common to render only parts of the scene at high detail, and to remove objects that are not important to what is currently being developed.     For real-time, it is appropriate to simplify one or more common approximations, and tune to the exact parameters of the scenery in question, which is also tuned to the agreed parameters to get the most bang for the buck.            The implementation of a realistic renderer always has some basic element of physical simulation or emulation & mdash; some computation which resembles or abstracts a real physical process.     The term  physically based  indicates the use of physical models and approximations that are more general and widely accepted outside rendering. A particular set of related techniques have gradually become established in the rendering community.     The basic concepts are moderately straightforward, but intractable to calculate; and a single elegant algorithm or approach has been elusive for more general purpose renderers. In order to meet demands of robustness, accuracy and practicality, an implementation will be a complex combination of different techniques.     Rendering research is concerned with both the adaptation of scientific models and their efficient application.            This is the key academic/theoretical concept in rendering.

In type theory and in outgrowths thereof such as the axiomatic set theory NF , the Quine–Rosser pair has the same type as its projections and hence is termed a type-level ordered pair. Hence this definition has the advantage of enabling a function , defined as a set of ordered pairs, to have a type only 1 higher than the type of its arguments. This definition works only if the set of natural numbers is infinite. This is the case in NF , but not in type theory or in NFU . J. Barkley Rosser showed that the existence of such a type-level ordered pair implies the axiom of infinity . For an extensive discussion of the ordered pair in the context of Quinian set theories, see Holmes . Holmes, M. Randall . Academia-Bruylant. The publisher has graciously consented to permit diffusion of this monograph via the web.       Early in the development of the set theory, before paradoxes were discovered, Cantor followed Frege by defining the ordered pair of two sets as the class of all relations that hold between these sets, assuming that the notion of relation is primitive: §144     : \\.     This definition is inadmissible in most modern formalized set theories and is methodologically similar to defining the cardinal of a set as the class of all sets equipotent with the given set. p. 22, footnote 59       Morse–Kelley set theory makes free use of proper class es. Morse defined the ordered pair so that its projections could be proper classes as well as sets. He first defined ordered pairs whose projections are sets in Kuratowskis manner. He then redefined the pair     : \\cup     where the component Cartesian products are Kuratowski pairs of sets and where     : s \\ \\cup \\     This renders possible pairs whose projections are proper classes. The Quine–Rosser definition above also admits proper class es as projections. Similarly the triple is defined as a 3-tuple as follows:     : \\cup \\cup     The use of the singleton set s which has an inserted empty set allows tuples to have the uniqueness property that if a is an n-tuple and b is an m-tuple and a b then n m. Ordered triples which are defined as ordered pairs do not have this property with respect to ordered pairs.       thu for the set product X 1 ×X 2 .   A category-theoretic product A × B in a category of sets represents the set of ordered pairs, with the first element coming from A and the second coming from B. In this context the characteristic property above is a consequence of the universal property of the product and the fact that elements of a set X can be identified with morphisms from 1 to X. While different objects may have the universal property, they are all \n",

Moreover, the integer solutions that define a given rational point are all sequences of the form   : \\left,   where  is any integer, and  is the greatest common divisor of the p_1.     It follows that solving the Diophantine equation Q0 is completely reduced to finding the rational points of the corresponding projective hypersurface.         Let now A\\left be an integer solution of the equation Q0. As  is a polynomial of degree two, a line passing through  crosses the hypersurface at a single other point, which is rational if and only if the line is rational . This allows parameterizing the hypersurface by the lines passing through , and the rational points are the those that are obtained from rational lines, that is, those that correspond to rational values of the parameters.     More precisely, one may proceed as follows.     By permuting the indices, one may suppose, without loss of generality that a_n\\ne 0. Then one may pass to the affine case by considering the \n",

      "ity that Hausdorff introduced. An ordinal is called regular if it is cofinal with any smaller ordinal; otherwise it is singular. Hausdorffs question whether there are regular numbers with index a limit ordinal, was the starting point for the theory of inaccessible cardinals. Hausdorff had already noticed that such numbers, if they exist, must be of exorbitant size . H.: Gesammelte Werke. Band  II: Grundzüge der Mengenlehre. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg etc. 2002. Kommentare von U.  Felgner, S.  598–601.     Of fundamental importance is the following theorem of Hausdorff: for each unbounded ordered dense set A there are two uniquely determined regular initial numbers \\omega_, \\omega_ so that A is cofinal with \\omega_ and coinitial with \\omega_^ . This theorem provides, for example, a technique to characterize elements and gaps in ordered sets. Thus Hausdorff utilized the gap characters and element characters introduced by him.     If W is a predetermined set of characters , the question arises whether there are ordered sets whose character set is exactly W . One can easily find a necessary condition for W . Hausdorff was able to show that this condition is also sufficient. For this one needs a rich reservoir of ordered sets; Hausdorff had created this with his theory of general products and powers. H.: Gesammelte Werke. Band  II: Grundzüge der Mengenlehre. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg etc. 2002. S.  604–605.

Next, we eliminate all free variables from φ by quantifying them existentially: if, say, x 1 ...x n  are free in φ, we form \\psi\\exists x_1 ... \\exists x_n \\phi . If ψ is satisfiable in a structure M, then certainly so is φ and if ψ is refutable, then \\neg \\psi \\forall x_1 ... \\forall x_n \\neg \\phi is provable, and then so is ¬φ, thus φ is refutable. We see that we can restrict φ to be a sentence, that is, a formula with no free variables.     Finally, we would like, for reasons of technical convenience, that the prefix of φ begin with a universal quantifier and end with an existential quantifier. To achieve this for a generic φ , we take some one-place relation symbol F unused in φ, and two new variables y and z.. If φ Φ, where stands for the prefix of φ and Φ for the matrix we form \\psi \\forall y \\exists z . Since \\forall y \\exists z is clearly provable, it is easy to see that \\phi\\psi is provable.         Our generic formula φ now is a sentence, in normal form, and its prefix starts with a universal quantifier and ends with an existential quantifier. Let us call the class of all such formulas R. We are faced with proving that every formula in R is either refutable or satisfiable. Given our formula φ, we group strings of quantifiers of one kind together in blocks:     : \\phi .......

The implementation may be arbitrarily inefficient, since the formal definition of the ADT, above, does not specify how much space the stack may use, nor how long each operation should take. It also does not specify whether the stack state s continues to exist after a call x ← pop .     In practice the formal definition should specify that the space is proportional to the number of items pushed and not yet popped; and that every one of the operations above must finish in a constant amount of time, independently of that number. To comply with these additional specifications, the implementation could use a linked list, or an array together with two integers .       Functional-style ADT definitions are more appropriate for functional programming languages, and vice versa. However, one can provide a functional-style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:     typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep; // type: stack state representation   typedef stack_Rep stack_T; // type: handle to a stack state   typedef void stack_Item; // type: value of a stack state     stack_T stack_empty; // returns the empty stack state   stack_T stack_push; // adds an item at the top of the stack state and returns the resulting stack state   stack_T stack_pop; // removes the top item from the stack state and returns the resulting stack state   stack_Item stack_top; // returns the top item of the stack state         Many modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.       The specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain built-in data types, defining only the operations that can be done on them. Therefore, those types can be viewed as built-in ADTs . Examples are the arrays in many scripting languages, such as \n",

Schroeder-Lein, The Encyclopedia of Civil War Medicine Conditions were poor in the Confederacy , where doctors and medical supplies were in short supply. H.H. Cunningham, Doctors in Gray: The Confederate Medical Service The war had a dramatic long-term impact on medicine in the U.S., from surgical technique to hospitals to nursing and to research facilities. Weapon development -particularly the appearance of Springfield Model 1861 , mass-produced and much more accurate than muskets led to generals underestimating the risks of long range rifle fire; risks exemplified in the death of John Sedgwick and the disastrous Picketts Charge . The rifles could shatter bone forcing amputation and longer ranges meant casualties were sometimes not quickly found. Evacuation of the wounded from Second Battle of Bull Run took a week. As in earlier wars, untreated casualties sometimes survived unexpectedly due to maggots debriding the wound -an observation which led to the surgical use of maggots -still a useful method in the absence of effective antibiotics.     The hygiene of the training and field camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and, especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.     This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department, Mary C. Gillett, The Army Medical Department, 1818–1865 and the United States Sanitary Commission , a new private agency.

A major breakthrough in epidemiology came with the introduction of statistical maps and graphs. They allowed careful analysis of seasonality issues in disease incidents, and the maps allowed public health officials to identify critical loci for the dissemination of disease. John Snow in London developed the methods. In 1849, he observed that the symptoms of cholera, which had already claimed around 500 lives within a month, were vomiting and diarrhoea. He concluded that the source of contamination must be through ingestion, rather than inhalation as was previously thought. It was this insight that resulted in the removal of The Pump On Broad Street, after which deaths from cholera plummeted afterwards. English nurse Florence Nightingale pioneered analysis of large amounts of statistical data, using graphs and tables, regarding the condition of thousands of patients in the Crimean War to evaluate the efficacy of hospital services. Her methods proved convincing and led to reforms in military and civilian hospitals, usually with the full support of the government. Gunn, S. William A.; Masellis, Michele . Concepts and Practice of Humanitarian Medicine. Springer. pp. 87–. . http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/Snow_Laura_Ball.pdf     By the late 19th and early 20th century English statisticians led by Francis Galton , Karl Pearson and Ronald Fisher developed the mathematical tools such as correlations and hypothesis tests that made possible much more sophisticated analysis of statistical data.     During the U.S. Civil War the Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns. The pioneer was John Shaw Billings . A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built the Library of the Surgeon Generals Office , the centerpiece of modern medical information systems. He also built the New York Public Library Billings figured out how to mechanically analyze medical and demographic data by turning facts into numbers and punching the numbers onto cardboard cards that could be sorted and counted by machine. The applications were developed by his assistant Herman Hollerith ; Hollerith invented the punch card and counter-sorter system that dominated statistical data manipulation until the 1970s. Holleriths company became International Business Machines in 1911.             Johns Hopkins Hospital , founded in 1889, originated several modern medical practices, including residency and rounds .       European ideas of modern medicine were spread widely through the world by medical missionaries, and the dissemination of textbooks. Japanese elites enthusiastically embraced Western medicine after the Meiji Restoration of the 1860s. However they had been prepared by their knowledge of the Dutch and German medicine, for they had some contact with Europe through the Dutch. Highly influential was the 1765 edition of Hendrik van Deventers pioneer work Nieuw Ligt on Japanese obstetrics, especially on Katakura Kakuryos publication in 1799 of Sanka Hatsumo . A cadre of Japanese physicians began to interact with Dutch doctors, who introduced smallpox vaccinations. By 1820 Japanese ranpô medical practitioners not only translated Dutch medical texts, they integrated their readings with clinical diagnoses. These men became leaders of the modernization of medicine in their country. They broke from Japanese traditions of closed medical fraternities and adopted the European approach of an open community of collaboration based on expertise in the latest scientific methods. Ann Jannetta, The Vaccinators: Smallpox, Medical Knowledge and the Opening of Japan     Kitasato Shibasaburō studied bacteriology in Germany under Robert Koch . In 1891 he founded the Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, which introduced the study of bacteriology to Japan. He and French researcher Alexandre Yersin went to Hong Kong in 1894, where; Kitasato confirmed Yersins discovery that the bacterium Yersinia pestis is the agent of the plague. In 1897 he isolates and described the organism that caused dysentery. He became the first dean of medicine at Keio University, and the first president of the Japan Medical Association.     Japanese physicians immediately recognized the values of X-Rays. They were able to purchase the equipment locally from the Shimadzu Company, which developed, manufactured, marketed, and distributed X-Ray machines after 1900. Japan not only adopted German methods of public health in the home islands, but implemented them in its colonies, especially Korea and Taiwan, and after 1931 in Manchuria. A heavy investment in sanitation resulted in a dramatic increase of life expectancy.

Until the nineteenth century, the care of the insane was largely a communal and family responsibility rather than a medical one. The vast majority of the mentally ill were treated in domestic contexts with only the most unmanageable or burdensome likely to be institutionally confined. ; ; ; This situation was transformed radically from the late eighteenth century as, amid changing cultural conceptions of madness, a new-found optimism in the curability of insanity within the asylum setting emerged. ; ; Increasingly, lunacy was perceived less as a physiological condition than as a mental and moral one ; to which the correct response was persuasion, aimed at inculcating internal restraint, rather than external coercion. ; This new therapeutic sensibility, referred to as moral treatment , was epitomised in French physician Philippe Pinel s quasi-mythological unchaining of the lunatics of the Bicêtre Hospital in Paris and realised in an institutional setting with the foundation in 1796 of the Quaker-run York Retreat in England.     thu , c. 1850–58. The asylum population in England and Wales rose from 1,027 in 1827 to 74,004 in 1900.     From the early nineteenth century, as lay-led lunacy reform movements gained in influence, ever more state governments in the West extended their authority and responsibility over the mentally ill. Small-scale asylums, conceived as instruments to reshape both the mind and behaviour of the disturbed, proliferated across these regions. ; By the 1830s, moral treatment, together with the asylum itself, became increasingly medicalised ; and asylum doctors began to establish a distinct medical identity with the establishment in the 1840s of associations for their members in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and America, together with the founding of medico-psychological journals. Medical optimism in the capacity of the asylum to cure insanity soured by the close of the nineteenth century as the growth of the asylum population far outstripped that of the general population. ; Processes of long-term institutional segregation, allowing for the psychiatric conceptualisation of the natural course of mental illness, supported the perspective that the insane were a distinct population, subject to mental pathologies stemming from specific medical causes. As degeneration theory grew in influence from the mid-nineteenth century, heredity was seen as the central causal element in chronic mental illness, ; ; and, with national asylum systems overcrowded and insanity apparently undergoing an inexorable rise, the focus of psychiatric therapeutics shifted from a concern with treating the individual to maintaining the racial and biological health of national populations. ; ; ; ;     Emil Kraepelin introduced new medical categories of mental illness , which eventually came into psychiatric usage despite their basis in behavior rather than pathology or underlying cause . Shell shock among frontline soldiers exposed to heavy artillery bombardment was first diagnosed by British Army doctors in 1915. By 1916, similar symptoms were also noted in soldiers not exposed to explosive shocks, leading to questions as to whether the disorder was physical or psychiatric. In the 1920s surrealist opposition to psychiatry was expressed in a number of surrealist publications. In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced including inducing seizures or cutting parts of the brain apart . Both came into widespread use by psychiatry, but there were grave concerns and much opposition on grounds of basic morality, harmful effects, or misuse. G. E. Berrios and Roy Porter The History of Clinical Psychiatry     In the 1950s new psychiatric drugs , notably the antipsychotic chlorpromazine , were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as tardive dyskinesia . Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control. There was also increasing opposition to the use of psychiatric hospitals, and attempts to move people back into the community on a collaborative user-led group approach not controlled by psychiatry. Campaigns against masturbation were done in the Victorian era and elsewhere. Lobotomy was used until the 1970s to treat schizophrenia . This was denounced by the anti-psychiatric movement in the 1960s and later.           The ABO blood group system was discovered in 1901, and the Rhesus blood group system in 1937, facilitating blood transfusion .     During the 20th century, large-scale wars were attended with medic s and mobile hospital units which developed advanced techniques for healing massive injuries and controlling infections rampant in battlefield conditions. During the Mexican Revolution , General Pancho Villa organized hospital trains for wounded soldiers. Boxcars marked Servicio Sanitario were re-purposed as surgical operating theaters and areas for recuperation, and staffed by up to 40 Mexican and U.S. physicians. Severely wounded soldiers were shuttled back to base hospitals. Friedrich Katz , The Life and Times of Pancho Villa. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1998, 292. Canadian physician Norman Bethune , M.D. developed a mobile blood-transfusion service for frontline operations in the Spanish Civil War , but ironically, he himself died of blood poisoning.   Thousands of scarred troops provided the need for improved prosthetic limb s and expanded techniques in plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery . Those practices were combined to broaden cosmetic surgery and other forms of elective surgery .     During the second World War , Alexis Carrel and Henry Dakin developed the Carrel-Dakin method of treating wounds with an irrigation, Dakins solution, a germicide which helped prevent gangrene . Mark Harrison, The Medical War: British Military Medicine in the First World War     The War spurred the usage of Roentgen s X-ray , and the electrocardiograph , for the monitoring of internal bodily functions. This was followed in the inter-war period by the development of the first anti-bacterial agents such as the sulpha antibiotics.         Public health measures become particular important during the 1918 flu pandemic , which killed at least 50 million people around the world. John M. Barry, The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History It became an important case study in epidemiology . Fred R. Van Hartesveldt, The Doctors and the Flu: The British Medical Professions Response to the Influenza Pandemic of 1918–19, International Social Science Review 851 pp.  28–39, online Bristow shows there was a gendered response of health caregivers to the pandemic in the United States. Male doctors were unable to cure the patients, and they felt like failures. Women nurses also saw their patients die, but they took pride in their success in fulfilling their professional role of caring for, ministering, comforting, and easing the last hours of their patients, and helping the families of the patients cope as well. Nancy K. Bristow, American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic     From 1917 to 1923, the American Red Cross moved into Europe with a battery of long-term child health projects. It built and operated hospitals and clinics, and organized antituberculosis and antityphus campaigns. A high priority involved child health programs such as clinics, better baby shows, playgrounds, fresh air camps, and courses for women on infant hygiene. Hundreds of U.S. doctors, nurses, and welfare professionals administered these programs, which aimed to reform the health of European youth and to reshape European public health and welfare along American lines.

The advances in medicine made a dramatic difference for Allied troops, while the Germans and especially the Japanese and Chinese suffered from a severe lack of newer medicines, techniques and facilities. Harrison finds that the chances of recovery for a badly wounded British infantryman were as much as 25 times better than in the First World War. The reason was that:   : By 1944 most casualties were receiving treatment within hours of wounding, due to the increased mobility of field hospitals and the extensive use of aeroplanes as ambulances. The care of the sick and wounded had also been revolutionized by new medical technologies, such as active immunization against tetanus, sulphonamide drugs, and penicillin.

Many of the details of these and related events were the focus of the Doctors Trial . Subsequently, principles of medical ethics , such as the Nuremberg Code , were introduced to prevent a recurrence of such atrocities. Horst H. Freyhofer, The Nuremberg Medical Trial: The Holocaust and the Origin of the Nuremberg Medical Code After 1937, the Japanese Army established programs of biological warfare in China.

Slater, War and Disease: Biomedical Research on Malaria in the Twentieth Century . The first goal was to protect soldiers, but it was widely adopted as a public health device. In Liberia, for example, the United States had large military operations during the war and the U.S. Public Health Service began the use of DDT for indoor residual spraying and as a larvicide, with the goal of controlling malaria in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. In the early 1950s, the project was expanded to nearby villages. In 1953, the World Health Organization launched an antimalaria program in parts of Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication in tropical Africa. However these projects encountered a spate of difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s. James L.A.

In some categories, the inverse limit of certain inverse systems does not exist. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any two inverse limits X and X of an inverse system, there exists a unique isomorphism X & prime; → X commuting with the projection maps.     We note that an inverse system in a category C admits an alternative description in terms of functor s. Any partially ordered set I can be considered as a small category where the morphisms consist of arrows i → j if and only if i ≤ j. An inverse system is then just a contravariant functor I → C, and the inverse limit functor   \\varprojlim:C^\\rightarrow C is a covariant functor .

That number could be obtained from irradiances in the direction of an incident or reflected wave  multiplied by cosθ for a wave at an angle θ to the normal direction . This complication can be ignored in the case of the reflection coefficient, since cosθ i    cosθ r , so that the ratio of reflected to incident irradiance in the waves direction is the same as in the direction normal to the interface.     Although these relationships describe the basic physics, in many practical applications one is concerned with natural light that can be describe as unpolarized. That means that there is an equal amount of power in the s and p polarizations, so that the effective reflectivity of the material is just the average of the two reflectivities:   : R_\\mathrm \\frac\\left.

For common glass  surrounded by air , the power reflectance at normal incidence can be seen to be about 4%, or 8% accounting for both sides of a glass pane.          At a dielectric interface from  to , there is a particular angle of incidence at which  goes to zero and a p-polarised incident wave is purely refracted. This angle is known as \n",

Note that in the cases of an interface into an absorbing material  or total internal reflection, the angle of transmission might not evaluate to a real number.     We consider the sign of a waves electric field in relation to a waves direction. Consequently for p polarization at normal incidence, the positive direction of electric field for an incident wave is opposite that of a reflected wave ; for s polarization both are the same . Some authors use the opposite sign convention for , so that  is positive when the incoming and reflected magnetic fields are anti-parallel, and negative when they are parallel. This latter convention has the convenient advantage that the s and p sign conventions are the same at normal incidence. However, either convention, when used consistently, gives the right answers.     Using these conventions, Lecture notes by Bo Sernelius, , see especially .

One can write similar equations applying to the ratio of magnetic fields of the waves, but these are usually not required.     Because the reflected and incident waves propagate in the same medium and make the same angle with the normal to the surface, the power reflection coefficient R is just the squared magnitude of r: Hecht, 2002, p.120, eq..   : R |r|^2.     On the other hand, calculation of the power transmission coefficient  is less straight-forward, since the light travels in different directions in the two media. Whats more, the wave impedances in the two media differ; power is only proportional to the square of the amplitude when the medias impedances are the same .

A PDA is formally defined as a 7-tuple:     M   where     Q is a finite set of states input alphabet stack alphabet transition relation start state initial stack symbol accepting states     An element \\in \\delta is a transition of M . It has the intended meaning that M , in state p \\in Q , on the input a \\in \\Sigma \\cup \\ and with A \\in \\Gamma as topmost stack symbol, may read a , change the state to q , pop A , replacing it by pushing \\alpha \\in \\Gamma^ . The component of the transition relation is used to formalize that the PDA can either read a letter from the input, or proceed leaving the input untouched.     In many texts  the transition relation is replaced by an formalization, where     \\delta is the transition function, mapping Q \\times \\times \\Gamma into finite subsets of Q \\times \\Gamma^     Here \\delta contains all possible actions in state p with A on the stack, while reading a on the input. One writes for example \\delta \\ precisely when \\in \\, \\in \\delta, because \\in \\delta . Note that finite in this definition is essential.      Computations         In order to formalize the semantics of the pushdown automaton a description of the current situation is introduced. Any 3-tuple \\in Q \\times \\Sigma^ \\times \\Gamma^ is called an instantaneous description of M , which includes the current state, the part of the input tape that has not been read, and the contents of the stack . The transition relation \\delta defines the step-relation \\vdash_ of M on instantaneous descriptions. For instruction \\in \\delta there exists a step \\vdash_ , for every x\\in\\Sigma^ and every \\gamma\\in \\Gamma^ .     In general pushdown automata are nondeterministic meaning that in a given instantaneous description there may be several possible steps. Any of these steps can be chosen in a computation.   With the above definition in each step always a single symbol is popped, replacing it with as many symbols as necessary. As a consequence no step is defined when the stack is empty.     Computations of the pushdown automaton are sequences of steps. The computation starts in the initial state q_ with the initial stack symbol Z on the stack, and a string w on the input tape, thus with initial description .   There are two modes of accepting. The pushdown automaton either accepts by final state, which means after reading its input the automaton reaches an accepting state , or it accepts by empty stack , which means after reading its input the automaton empties its stack. The first acceptance mode uses the internal memory , the second the external memory .

For each single pushdown automaton these two languages need to have no relation: they may be equal but usually this is not the case. A specification of the automaton should also include the intended mode of acceptance. Taken over all pushdown automata both acceptance conditions define the same family of languages.     Theorem. For each pushdown automaton M one may construct a pushdown automaton M such that LN , and vice versa, for each pushdown automaton M one may construct a pushdown automaton M such that NL         The following is the formal description of the PDA which recognizes the language \\ by final state:        M , where     states: Q \\   input alphabet: \\Sigma \\   stack alphabet: \\Gamma \\   start state: q_ p   start stack symbol:  accepting states: F \\     The transition relation \\delta consists of the following six instructions:     : ,   : ,   : ,   : ,   : , and   : .     In words, the first two instructions say that in state  any time the symbol  is read, one  is pushed onto the stack. Pushing symbol  on top of another  is formalized as replacing top  by  .     The third and fourth instructions say that, at any moment the automaton may move from state  to state .     The fifth instruction says that in state , for each symbol  read, one  is popped.     Finally, the sixth instruction says that the machine may move from state  to accepting state  only when the stack consists of a single .     There seems to be no generally used representation for PDA. Here we have depicted the instruction by an edge from state  to state  labelled by a; A/\\alpha .            The following illustrates how the above PDA computes on different input strings. The subscript  from the step symbol \\vdash is here omitted.            Every \n",
      " is a device which is more powerful than a pushdown automaton but less so than a Turing machine.         A GPDA is a PDA which writes an entire string of some known length to the stack or removes an entire string from the stack in one step.     A GPDA is formally defined as a 6-tuple:   : M   where Q, \\Sigma\\,, \\Gamma\\,, q_0 , and  are defined the same way as a PDA.   : \\,\\delta : Q \\times \\Sigma_ \\times \\Gamma^ \\longrightarrow P   is the transition function.     Computation rules for a GPDA are the same as a PDA except that the a_ s and b_ s are now strings instead of symbols.     GPDAs and PDAs are equivalent in that if a language is recognized by a PDA, it is also recognized by a GPDA and vice versa.     One can formulate an analytic proof for the equivalence of GPDAs and PDAs using the following simulation:     Let \\delta \\longrightarrow be a transition of the GPDA     where q_1, q_2 \\in Q, w \\in\\Sigma_, x_1, x_2,\\ldots,x_m\\in\\Gamma^, m\\geq 0, y_1, y_2,\\ldots, y_n\\in\\Gamma^, n\\geq 0 .

A stack automaton is called nonerasing if it never pops from the stack. The class of languages accepted by nondeterministic, nonerasing stack automata is  NSPACE , which is a superset of the \n",

In an existential state an APDA nondeterministically chooses the next state and accepts if at least one of the resulting computations accepts. In a universal state APDA moves to all next states and accepts if all the resulting computations accept.     The model was introduced by \n",

In this calculation we do not perform the carry-over operation during addition as is usual in normal multiplication. Note that we can halve the number of operations required by exploiting the inherent symmetry of the autocorrelation. If the signal happens to be periodic, i.e. x, then we get a circular autocorrelation  where the left and right tails of the previous autocorrelation sequence will overlap and give R_ which has the same period as the signal sequence x.

The set of all partial functions  from a set X to a set Y, denoted by , is the union of all total functions defined on subsets of X with same codomain Y:   : \\bigcup_   the latter also written as \\bigcup\\limits_ Y^D . In finite case, its cardinality is   : | ^,   because any partial function can be extended to a total function by any fixed value c not contained in Y, so that the codomain is , an operation which is injective .       The first diagram at the top of the article represents a partial function that is not a total function since the element 1 in the left-hand set is not associated with anything in the right-hand set.

For this reason, the derivative is sometimes called the slope of the function .     Here is a particular example, the derivative of the squaring function at the input 3. Let  be the squaring function.          : \\beginf & \\lim_ \\\\   & \\lim_ \\\\   & \\lim_ \\\\   & \\lim_ \\\\   & 6   \\end       The slope of the tangent line to the squaring function at the point is 6, that is to say, it is going up six times as fast as it is going to the right. The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.            A common notation, introduced by Leibniz, for the derivative in the example above is   :   \\begin   y & x^2 \\\\   \\frac & 2x.   \\end     In an approach based on limits, the symbol  is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as a shorthand for the limit computed above. Leibniz, however, did intend it to represent the quotient of two infinitesimally small numbers,  being the infinitesimally small change in  caused by an infinitesimally small change  applied to . We can also think of  as a differentiation operator, which takes a function as an input and gives another function, the derivative, as the output. For example:   :   \\frac2x.       In this usage, the  in the denominator is read as with respect to  . Another example of correct notation could be:     \\begin   g t^2 + 2t + 4 \\\\ \\\\   g 2t + 2   \\end       Even when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals, it is common to manipulate symbols like  and  as if they were real numbers; although it is possible to avoid such manipulations, they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the \n",
      " . The definite integral is written as:     : \\int_a^b f\\, dx.     and is read the integral from a to b of f-of-x with respect to x. The Leibniz notation  is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width  becomes the infinitesimally small . In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation     : \\int_a^b \\cdots\\, dx     is to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an output. The terminating differential, , is not a number, and is not being multiplied by , although, serving as a reminder of the  limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations of the integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which the function is integrated and serves as a closing bracket for the integration operator.     The indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:     : \\int f\\, dx.     Functions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant. Since the derivative of the function , where  is any constant, is , the antiderivative of the latter given by:   : \\int 2x\\, dx x^2 + C.

In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it  to indicate its inclination .     Specifically, let \\mathbf_0 be the position vector of some point P_0 , and let \\mathbf be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by this point and vector consists of those points P , with position vector \\mathbf , such that the vector drawn from P_0 to P is perpendicular to \\mathbf .

Writing the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences, where one event has coordinates  and , another event has coordinates and , and the differences are defined as     :     \\Delta x x_2-x_1 \\ , \\ \\Delta t t_2-t_1 \\ .   :     \\Delta x x_2-x_1 \\ , \\ \\ \\Delta t t_2-t_1 \\ .     we get     :     \\Delta x \\gamma \\ \\ ,\\ \\ \\Delta t \\gamma \\ \\left \\ .   :     \\Delta x \\gamma \\ \\ , \\ \\Delta t \\gamma \\ \\left \\ .

Spacetime diagrams  are an extremely useful aid to visualizing how coordinates transform between different reference frames. Although it is not as easy to perform exact computations using them as directly invoking the Lorentz transformations, their main power is their ability to provide an intuitive grasp of the results of a relativistic scenario.     To draw a spacetime diagram, begin by considering two Galilean reference frames, S and S, in standard configuration, as shown in Fig.  2 & 8209;1.       Fig.  3 & 8209;1a. Draw the x and t axes of frame S. The x axis is horizontal and the t axis is vertical, which is the opposite of the usual convention in kinematics. The ct axis is scaled by a factor of c so that both axes have common units of length. In the diagram shown, the gridlines are spaced one unit distance apart. The 45° diagonal lines represent the worldlines of two photons passing through the origin at time t 0. The slope of these worldlines is 1 because the photons advance one unit in space per unit of time. Two events, \\text and \\text, have been plotted on this graph so that their coordinates may be compared in the S and S frames.     Fig.  3 & 8209;1b. Draw the x and ct axes of frame S. The ct axis represents the worldline of the origin of the S coordinate system as measured in frame S. In this figure, v c/2. Both the ct and x axes are tilted from the unprimed axes by an angle \\alpha \\tan^, where \\beta v/c. The primed and unprimed axes share a common origin because frames S and S had been set up in standard configuration, so that t0 when t0.     Fig.  3 & 8209;1c. Units in the primed axes have a different scale from units in the unprimed axes. From the Lorentz transformations, we observe that coordinates of in the primed coordinate system transform to in the unprimed coordinate system. Likewise, coordinates of in the primed coordinate system transform to in the unprimed system. Draw gridlines parallel with the ct axis through points as measured in the unprimed frame, where k is an integer. Likewise, draw gridlines parallel with the x axis through as measured in the unprimed frame. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we observe that the spacing between ct units equals \\sqrt times the spacing between ct units, as measured in frame S. This ratio is always greater than 1, and ultimately it approaches infinity as \\beta \\rightarrow 1.     Fig.  3 & 8209;1d. Since the speed of light is an invariant, the worldlines of two photons passing through the origin at time t 0 still plot as 45° diagonal lines. The primed coordinates of \\text and \\text are related to the unprimed coordinates through the Lorentz transformations and could be approximately measured from the graph , but the real merit of a Minkowski diagram is its granting us a geometric view of the scenario. For example, in this figure, we observe that the two timelike-separated events that had different x-coordinates in the unprimed frame are now at the same position in space.     While the unprimed frame is drawn with space and time axes that meet at right angles, the primed frame is drawn with axes that meet at acute or obtuse angles. The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates map onto a \n",
      ".  The speed of light was measured in still water. What would be the speed of light in flowing water?     In 1851, Fizeau conducted an experiment to answer this question, a simplified representation of which is illustrated in Fig.  5 & 8209;1. A beam of light is divided by a beam splitter, and the split beams are passed in opposite directions through a tube of flowing water. They are recombined to form interference fringes, indicating a difference in optical path length, that an observer can view. The experiment demonstrated that dragging of the light by the flowing water caused displacement of the fringes, showing that the motion of the water had affected the speed of the light.     According to the theories prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus the speed of the medium. Contrary to expectation, Fizeau found that although light appeared to be dragged by the water, the magnitude of the dragging was much lower than expected. If u c/n is the speed of light in still water, and v is the speed of the water, and u_ is the water-bourne speed of light in the lab frame with the flow of water adding to or subtracting from the speed of light, then     : u_ \\frac \\pm v\\left \\ .

The classical calculation of the displacement takes two forms and makes different predictions depending on whether the receiver, the source, or both are in motion with respect to the medium. If the receiver is in motion, the displacement would be the consequence of the \n",
      " term, and that is the treatment described here.       Assume the receiver and the source are moving away from each other with a relative speed v\\, as measured by an observer on the receiver or the source . Assume that the source is stationary in the medium. Then     : f_ f_s   where c_s is the speed of sound.     For light, and with the receiver moving at relativistic speeds, clocks on the receiver are \n",

Another disadvantage is that the interpolant is not \n",
      " at the point x k .     The following error estimate shows that linear interpolation is not very precise. Denote the function which we want to interpolate by g, and suppose that x lies between x a and x b and that g is twice continuously differentiable. Then the linear interpolation error is     : |f-g| \\le C^2 \\quad\\text\\quad C \\frac18 \\max_ |g x 2.5, we find that f 0.5965.     Generally, if we have n data points, there is exactly one polynomial of degree at most n & minus;1 going through all the data points. The interpolation error is proportional to the distance between the data points to the power n. Furthermore, the interpolant is a polynomial and thus infinitely differentiable. So, we see that polynomial interpolation overcomes most of the problems of linear interpolation.     However, polynomial interpolation also has some disadvantages. Calculating the interpolating polynomial is computationally expensive compared to linear interpolation. Furthermore, polynomial interpolation may exhibit oscillatory artifacts, especially at the end points .     Polynomial interpolation can estimate local maxima and minima that are outside the range of the samples, unlike linear interpolation. For example, the interpolant above has a local maximum at x ≈ 1.566, f ≈ 1.003 and a local minimum at x ≈ 4.708, f ≈ −1.003. However, these maxima and minima may exceed the theoretical range of the function—for example, a function that is always positive may have an interpolant with negative values, and whose inverse therefore contains false vertical asymptotes .     More generally, the shape of the resulting curve, especially for very high or low values of the independent variable, may be contrary to commonsense, i.e. to what is known about the experimental system which has generated the data points. These disadvantages can be reduced by using spline interpolation or restricting attention to Chebyshev polynomials .         rig       Remember that linear interpolation uses a linear function for each of intervals x k ,x k+1 . Spline interpolation uses low-degree polynomials in each of the intervals, and chooses the polynomial pieces such that they fit smoothly together. The resulting function is called a spline .     For instance, the natural cubic spline is piecewise cubic and twice continuously differentiable. Furthermore, its second derivative is zero at the end points. The natural cubic spline interpolating the points in the table above is given by     : f \\begin   -0.1522 x^3 + 0.9937 x, & \\text x \\in \\\\   -0.01258 x^3 - 0.4189 x^2 + 1.4126 x - 0.1396, & \\text x \\in \\\\   0.1403 x^3 - 1.3359 x^2 + 3.2467 x - 1.3623, & \\text x \\in \\\\   0.1579 x^3 - 1.4945 x^2 + 3.7225 x - 1.8381, & \\text x \\in \\\\   0.05375 x^3 -0.2450 x^2 - 1.2756 x + 4.8259, & \\text x \\in \\\\   -0.1871 x^3 + 3.3673 x^2 - 19.3370 x + 34.9282, & \\text x \\in   \\end     In this case we get f    0.5972.     Like polynomial interpolation, spline interpolation incurs a smaller error than linear interpolation and the interpolant is smoother. However, the interpolant is easier to evaluate than the high-degree polynomials used in polynomial interpolation. However, the global nature of the basis functions leads to ill-conditioning. This is completely mitigated by using splines of compact support, such as are implemented in Boost.Math and discussed in Kress.         Interpolation is a common way to approximate functions. Given a function f: \\to \\mathbb with a set of points x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n \\in one can form a function s: \\to \\mathbb such that fs for i1, 2, \\dots, n . In general, an interpolant need not be a good approximation, but there are well known and often reasonable conditions where it will. For example, if f\\in C^4 then cubic spline interpolation has an error bound given by \\|f-s\\|_\\infty \\leq C \\|f^\\|_\\infty h^4 where h \\max_ |x_-x_i| and C is a constant.       Gaussian process is a powerful non-linear interpolation tool. Many popular interpolation tools are actually equivalent to particular Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes can be used not only for fitting an interpolant that passes exactly through the given data points but also for regression, i.e., for fitting a curve through noisy data. In the geostatistics community Gaussian process regression is also known as Kriging .       Other forms of interpolation can be constructed by picking a different class of interpolants. For instance, rational interpolation is interpolation by rational function s using Padé approximant , and trigonometric interpolation is interpolation by trigonometric polynomial s using Fourier series . Another possibility is to use wavelet s.     The Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula can be used if the number of data points is infinite.     Sometimes, we know not only the value of the function that we want to interpolate, at some points, but also its derivative. This leads to Hermite interpolation problems.     When each data point is itself a function, it can be useful to see the interpolation problem as a partial advection problem between each data point. This idea leads to the displacement interpolation problem used in transportation theory .           Multivariate interpolation is the interpolation of functions of more than one variable.   Methods include bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation in two dimensions, and trilinear interpolation in three dimensions.   They can be applied to gridded or scattered data.       Image:Nearest2DInterpolExample.png|Nearest neighbor   Image:BilinearInterpolExample.png|Bilinear   Image:BicubicInterpolationExample.png|Bicubic         In the domain of digital signal processing, the term interpolation refers to the process of converting a sampled digital signal to that of a higher sampling rate using various digital filtering techniques . In this application there is a specific requirement that the harmonic content of the original signal be preserved without creating aliased harmonic content of the original signal above the original Nyquist limit of the signal . An early and fairly elementary discussion on this subject can be found in Rabiner and Crochieres book Multirate Digital Signal Processing.       The term \n",

      ".       Start with a space , and some point in it, and all the loops both starting and ending at this point — paths that start at this point, wander around and eventually return to the starting point. Two loops can be combined together in an obvious way: travel along the first loop, then along the second.   Two loops are considered equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without breaking. The set of all such loops with this method of combining and this equivalence between them is the fundamental group for that particular space.            Throughout this article, X is a topological space. A typical example is a surface such as the one depicted at the right. Moreover, x_0 is a point in X called the base-point. The idea of the definition of the homotopy group is to measure how many curves on X can be deformed into each other. The precise definition depends on the notion of the homotopy of loops, which is explained first.         Given a topological space X, a  loop based at x_0  is defined to be a \n",
      "    : \\gamma : \\to X   such that both the starting point \\gamma and the end point \\gamma are both equal to x_0.        A  homotopy  is a continuous interpolation between two loops. More precisely, a homotopy between two loops \\gamma, \\gamma : \\to X is a continuous map   : h : \\times \\to X,   such that   : h x_0 for all t \\in that is, the starting point of the homotopy is x_0 for all t .   : h x_0 for all t \\in that is, similarly the end point stays at x_0 for all t.   : h \\gamma, h \\gamma for all r \\in     If such a homotopy h exists, \\gamma and \\gamma are said to be homotopic. The relation \\gamma is homotopic to \\gamma is an \n",
      "es can be considered:   : \\pi_1 : \\ / \\text   It is called the fundamental group of the topological space X and the base point x_0. The purpose of considering the equivalence classes of loops up to homotopy, as opposed to the set of all loops  is that the latter, while being useful for various purposes, is a rather big and unwieldy object. By contrast the above quotient has, in many cases, a manageable and computable size.          By the above definition, \\pi_1 is just a set. It becomes a group  using the concatenation of loops. More precisely, given two loops \\gamma_0, \\gamma_1, their product is defined as the loop   : \\begin   \\gamma_0 \\cdot \\gamma_1 : & \\to X \\\\   & \\begin   \\gamma_0 & 0 \\leq t \\leq \\tfrac \\\\   \\gamma_1 & \\tfrac \\leq t \\leq 1.   \\end   \\end   Thus the loop \\gamma_0 \\cdot \\gamma_1 first follows the loop \\gamma_0 with twice the speed and then follows \\gamma_1 with twice the speed .     The product of two homotopy classes of loops and is then defined as It can be shown that this product does not depend on the choice of representatives and therefore gives a well-defined operation on the set \\pi_1. This operation turns \\pi_1 into a group. Its \n",
      " is the constant loop which stays at x_0 for all times t. The inverse of a loop is the same loop, but traversed in the opposite direction. More formally,   : \\gamma^ : \\gamma.   Given three based loops \\gamma_0, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, the product   : \\cdot \\gamma_2   is the concatenation of these loops, traversing \\gamma_0 and then \\gamma_1 with quadruple speed, and then \\gamma_2 with double speed. By comparison,   : \\gamma_0 \\cdot   traverses the same paths , but \\gamma_0 with double speed, and \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2 with quadruple speed. Thus, because of the differing speeds, the two paths are not identical. The \n",
      " axiom   : \\cdot \\left \\left \\cdot   therefore crucially depends on the fact that paths are considered up to homotopy. Indeed, both above composites are homotopic, for example, to the loops which traverses all three loops \\gamma_0, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2 with triple speed. The set of based loops up to homotopy, equipped with the above operation therefore does turn \\pi_1 into a group.       Although the fundamental group in general depends on the choice of base point, it turns out that, \n",

      ", if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the momentum is in gram centimeters per second .     Being a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1  kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1  m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1  kg⋅m/s due north measured with reference to the ground.       The momentum of a system of particles is the vector sum of their momenta. If two particles have respective masses  and , and velocities  and , the total momentum is   : \\begin p & p_1 + p_2 \\\\   & m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\,. \\end   The momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:   : p \\sum_ m_i v_i .

Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including \n",
      ".      A head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are  and  before the collision and  and  after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:   : \\begin m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 & m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\\\   \\tfrac m_1 u_1^2 + \\tfrac m_2 u_2^2 & \\tfrac m_1 v_1^2 + \\tfrac m_2 v_2^2\\,.\\end     A change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass , one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed  . The center of mass is moving at speed  and both bodies are moving towards it at speed . Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed . The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by   : \\begin v_1 & u_2\\\\   v_2 & u_1\\,. \\end     In general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by    : v_ \\left u_ + \\left u_\\,   : v_ \\left u_ + \\left u_\\,.

      ".     This process of decomposition may be undertaken to gain insight into the identity of the constituent components which may reflect individual physical processes of interest. Also functional decomposition may result in a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of modularity .     Interactions between the components are critical to the function of the collection. All interactions may not be observable, but possibly deduced through repetitive perception, synthesis, validation and verification of composite behavior.       For a multivariate function y f , functional decomposition generally refers to a process of identifying a set of functions \\ such that     : f \\phi     where \\phi is some other function. Thus, we would say that the function f is decomposed into functions \\ . This process is intrinsically hierarchical in the sense that we can seek to further decompose the functions g_i into a collection of constituent functions \\ such that     : g_i \\gamma     where \\gamma is some other function. Decompositions of this kind are interesting and important for a wide variety of reasons. In general, functional decompositions are worthwhile when there is a certain sparseness in the dependency structure; that is, when constituent functions are found to depend on approximately \n",
      " of variables. Thus, for example, if we can obtain a decomposition of x_1 f into a hierarchical composition of functions \\ such that x_1 g_1 , x_2 g_2 , x_5 g_3 , as shown in the figure at right, this would probably be considered a highly valuable decomposition.       A basic example of functional decomposition is expressing the four binary arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in terms of the two binary operations of addition a + b and multiplication a \\times b, and the two unary operations of additive inversion -a and multiplicative inversion 1/a. Subtraction can then be realized as the composition of addition and additive inversion, a - b a + , and division can be realized as the composition of multiplication and multiplicative inverse, a \\div b a \\times . This simplifies the analysis of subtraction and division, and also makes it easier to axiomatize these operations in the notion of a \n",
      ".           As to why the decomposition is valuable, the reason is twofold. Firstly, decomposition of a function into non-interacting components generally permits more economical representations of the function. For example, on a set of quaternary variables, representing the full function x_1f requires storing 4^51024 values, the value of the function for each element in the \n",
      " \\ , i.e., each of the 1024 possible combinations for \\ . However, if the decomposition into \\ given above is possible, then g_1 g_1 requires storing 4 values, g_2 g_2 requires storing 4^364 values, and g_3 g_3 again requires storing just 4 values. So in virtue of the decomposition, we need store only 4+64+472 values rather than 1024 values, a dramatic savings.        Intuitively, this reduction in representation size is achieved simply because each variable depends only on a subset of the other variables. Thus, variable x_1 only depends directly on variable x_2 , rather than depending on the entire set of variables. We would say that variable x_2 screens off variable x_1 from the rest of the world. Practical examples of this phenomenon surround us, as discussed in the Philosophical Considerations below, but lets just consider the particular case of northbound traffic on the \n",

By definition of \\gamma , the kernel of \\gamma ,   ker \\ , is the set of all even integers.   Let H ker.   Then H is a subgroup, because the identity in \\Z , which is 0 , is in H ,   the sum of two even integers is even and hence if m and n are in H , m+n is in H   and if m is even, -m is also even and so H contains its inverses.

This infinite degree of freedom for the emission of the photon results in the apparent irreversible decay, i.e., spontaneous emission.     In the presence of electromagnetic vacuum modes, the combined atom-vacuum system is explained by the superposition of the wavefunctions of the excited state atom with no photon and the ground state atom with a single emitted photon:     : |\\psi\\rangle ae^|e;0\\rangle + \\sum_ b_e^|g;1_\\rangle     where |e;0\\rangle and a are the atomic excited state-electromagnetic vacuum wavefunction and its probability amplitude, |g;1_\\rangle and b_ are the ground state atom with a single photon wavefunction and its probability amplitude, \\omega_0 is the atomic transition frequency, and \\omega_k c|k| is the frequency of the photon. The sum is over k and s , which are the wavenumber and polarization of the emitted photon, respectively. As mentioned above, the emitted photon has a chance to be emitted with different wavenumbers and polarizations, and the resulting wavefunction is a superposition of these possibilities. To calculate the probability of the atom at the ground state , one needs to solve the time evolution of the wavefunction with an appropriate Hamiltonian. To solve for the transition amplitude, one needs to average over all the vacuum modes, since one must consider the probabilities that the emitted photon occupies various parts of phase space equally. The spontaneously emitted photon has infinite different modes to propagate into, thus the probability of the atom re-absorbing the photon and returning to the original state is negligible, making the atomic decay practically irreversible. Such irreversible time evolution of the atom-vacuum system is responsible for the apparent spontaneous decay of an excited atom. If one were to keep track of all the vacuum modes, the combined atom-vacuum system would undergo unitary time evolution, making the decay process reversible. \n",

In this case one speaks of full radiative decay and this means that the quantum efficiency is 100%. Besides radiative decay, which occurs under the emission of light, there is a second decay mechanism; nonradiative decay.

In both cases, we have a contradiction.           Suppose, for concreteness, that we have an algorithm for examining a program p and determining infallibly whether p is an implementation of the squaring function, which takes an integer d and returns d 2 . The proof works just as well if we have an algorithm for deciding any other nontrivial property of program behavior , and is given in general below.     The claim is that we can convert our algorithm for identifying squaring programs into one that identifies functions that halt. We will describe an algorithm that takes inputs a and i and determines whether program a halts when given input i.     The algorithm for deciding this is conceptually simple: it constructs a new program t taking an argument n, which first executes program a on input i , and then returns the square of n. If a runs forever, then t never gets to step , regardless of n. Then clearly, t is a function for computing squares if and only if step terminates. Since weve assumed that we can infallibly identify programs for computing squares, we can determine whether t, which depends on a and i, is such a program, and that for every a and i; thus we have obtained a program that decides whether program a halts on input i. Note that our halting-decision algorithm never executes t, but only passes its description to the squaring-identification program, which by assumption always terminates; since the construction of the description of t can also be done in a way that always terminates, the halting-decision cannot fail to halt either.     halts      This method doesnt depend specifically on being able to recognize functions that compute squares; as long as some program can do what were trying to recognize, we can add a call to a to obtain our t. We could have had a method for recognizing programs for computing square roots, or programs for computing the monthly payroll, or programs that halt when given the input Abraxas ; in each case, we would be able to solve the halting problem similarly.            For the formal proof, algorithms are presumed to define partial functions over \n",
      ".       One can regard Rices theorem as asserting the impossibility of effectively deciding for any recursively enumerable set   whether it has a certain nontrivial property. A set S\\subseteq \\mathbb is  recursively enumerable  if   SW_e:\\textrm\\, \\phi_e:\\   for some e , where W_e is the domain \\textrm\\, \\phi_e   of \\phi_e .   The result for recursively enumerable sets can be obtained from that for computable functions by   considering the class \\ , where C is a class of   recursively enumerable sets.   In this section, we give an analogue of Rices theorem for \n",
      " , instead of recursively enumerable sets. A recursively enumerable   set S\\subseteq \\mathbb is  recursive  if its complement is recursively enumerable.   Equivalently, S is recursive if its characteristic function is computable.   Roughly speaking, the analogue says that if one can effectively determine for every recursive set whether it has a certain property,   then only finitely many integers determine whether a recursive set has the property.   This result is analogous to the original theorem of Rice, because both results assert that a property is decidable   only if one can determine whether a set has that property by examining for at most finitely many i    , if i belongs to the set.     Let W be a class  of recursive sets.   If S is a recursive set, then for some e , computable function \\phi_e   is the characteristic function of S . We call e a characteristic index for S .     Lets say the class W is computable if there is an algorithm that decides   for any nonnegative integer e ,   if e is a characteristic index for a recursive set belonging to W , then the algorithm gives yes ;   if e is a characteristic index for a recursive set not belonging to W , then the algorithm gives no .

Another way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix. If we write an  matrix A in terms of its column vectors   : A \\begin a_1 & a_2 & \\cdots & a_n \\end     where the a_j are vectors of size n, then the determinant of A is defined so that   : \\begin   \\det \\begin a_1 & \\cdots & b a_j + c v & \\cdots & a_n \\end   & b\\det + c \\det \\begin a_1 & \\cdots & v & \\cdots & a_n \\end \\\\   \\det \\begin a_1 & \\cdots & a_j & a_ & \\cdots & a_n \\end   & -\\det \\begin a_1 & \\cdots & a_ & a_j & \\cdots & a_n \\end \\\\   \\det & 1   \\end     where b and c are scalars, v is any vector of size n and I is the \n",

The entries can be numbers or expressions ; the definition of the determinant depends only on the fact that they can be added and multiplied together in a \n",

      ".     Alternatively, if the excited-state atom is perturbed by an electric field of frequency ν 0 , it may emit an additional photon of the same frequency and in phase, thus augmenting the external field, leaving the atom in the lower energy state. This process is known as stimulated emission.     In a group of such atoms, if the number of atoms in the excited state is given by N 2 , the rate at which stimulated emission occurs is given by     : \\frac   -\\frac   - B_ \\, \\rho \\, N_2     where the \n",
      " B 21 is known as the  Einstein B coefficient  for that particular transition, and ρ is the radiation density of the incident field at frequency ν. The rate of emission is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the excited state N 2 , and to the density of incident photons.     At the same time, there will be a process of atomic absorption which removes energy from the field while raising electrons from the lower state to the upper state. Its rate is given by an essentially identical equation,     : \\frac   -\\frac   B_ \\, \\rho \\, N_1 .     The rate of absorption is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the lower state, N 1 . Einstein showed that the coefficient for this transition must be identical to that for stimulated emission:     : B_ B_ .     Thus absorption and stimulated emission are reverse processes proceeding at somewhat different rates. Another way of viewing this is to look at the net stimulated emission or absorption viewing it as a single process. The net rate of transitions from E 2 to E 1 due to this combined process can be found by adding their respective rates, given above:     : \\frac   - \\frac   B_ \\, \\rho \\,   B_ \\, \\rho \\, \\Delta N .     Thus a net power is released into the electric field equal to the photon energy hν times this net transition rate. In order for this to be a positive number, indicating net stimulated emission, there must be more atoms in the excited state than in the lower level: \\Delta N /math math \n",

When the photon is emitted at a distance equal to the Schwarzschild radius, the redshift will be infinitely large, and it will not escape to any finite distance from the Schwarzschild sphere.
