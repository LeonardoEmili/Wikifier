Newton also explains his two primary motives for publishing: his desire to promote the faith and comfort of sincere Christians , and as a permanent record of his friendship with Cowper. Newton is attributed with suggesting that he and Cowper collaborate on a collection of hymns, ultimately drawn largely from Newtons texts accumulated over some 10 years . Of the 348 hymns in the original published edition of 1779, some commentaries state that Cowper wrote just 66 between 1772 and 1773, and Newton the remainder, while other sources attribute 67 to Cowper. It is known, however, that Newton wrote some of the hymns in direct response to events around him: Oh for a closer walk with God for instance was written by Cowper in response to the serious illness then being suffered by his house companion, ": null

It is assumed that they were initially sung to any suitable tune that fitted the metre , most probably to 16th or 17th century metrical psalm tunes. Subsequently, individual tunes have become linked to specific hymns from the Olney books. For example, the tune Austria  is associated today with the hymn  Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken , just as New Britain, an American folk melody believed to be Scottish or Irish in origin, has since the 1830s been associated with  Amazing Grace .

The belief in eternal life after death is expressed in stanzas five and six: when this flesh and heart shall fail , I shall possess A life of joy and peace , and God, who calld me here below, Will be for ever mine .     Amazing Grace was not the original title of this hymn: It was originally written as a poem entitled Faiths Review and Expectation and appears as Hymn 41 in Book I of the Olney Hymns with that title. The six stanza version quoted is the original, as written by Newton, but it has also appeared in longer forms where others have added verses or where verses from other hymns from the Olney books have been moved across.     The Olney Hymns are subdivided into three books: Book I, On Select Texts of Scripture; Book II, On occasional Subjects; and, Book III, On the Progress and Changes of the Spiritual Life. The sub-divisions reflect key Evangelical beliefs. Book I holds that the Bible is the ultimate source of religious authority, and its hymns are written to provide the believer, through simple language, with a thorough understanding of its contents.
