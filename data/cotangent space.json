Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write   :df x  & prime;   In either case, df x is a linear map on T x M and hence it is a tangent covector at x.     We can then define the differential map d : C ∞  → T x M at a point x as the map which sends f to df x . Properties of the differential map include:     d is a linear map: d a df + b dg for constants a and b,   d x fdg x + gdf x ,     The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function f ∈ I x  we can form the linear functional df x as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on I x 2 , d descends to a map from I x / I x 2 to the dual of the tangent space,  . One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.         Just as every differentiable map f : M → N between manifolds induces a linear map  between the tangent spaces   : f_^\\colon T_x M \\to T_ N   every such map induces a linear map  between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:   : f^\\colon T_^ N \\to T_^ M   The pullback is naturally defined as the dual of the ": null

If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let g be a smooth function on N vanishing at f. Then the pullback of the covector determined by g  is given by   : f^\\mathrm dg \\mathrm d.   That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on M vanishing at x determined by g o f.         The k-th ": null
