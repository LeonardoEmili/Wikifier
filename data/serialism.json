Other terms used to make the distinction are twelve-note serialism for the former and integral serialism for the latter.     A row may be assembled pre-compositionally , or derived from a spontaneously invented thematic or motivic idea. The rows structure does not in itself define the structure of a composition, which requires development of a comprehensive strategy. The choice of strategy often depends on the relationships contained in a row class, and rows may be constructed with an eye to producing the relationships needed to form desired strategies.

Stockhausen, for example, in early serial compositions such as  Kreuzspiel  and  Formel , advances in unit sections within which a preordained set of pitches is repeatedly reconfigured  ... The composers model for the distributive serial process corresponds to a development of the Zwölftonspiel of Josef Matthias Hauer , and Goeyvaerts, in such a work as Nummer 42, provides a classic illustration of the distributive function of seriality: 42 times an equal number of elements of equal duration within an equal global time is distributed in the most equable way, unequally with regard to one another, over the temporal space: from the greatest possible coïncidence to the greatest possible dispersion.

The twelve-tone series loses its imperative function as a prohibiting, regulating, and patterning authority; its working-out is abandoned through its own constant-frequent presence: all 42 intervallic relations among the 42 pitches being virtually present. Prohibited intervals, like the octave, and prohibited successional relations, such as premature note repetitions, frequently occur, although obscured in the dense contexture. The number twelve no longer plays any governing, defining rôle; the pitch constellations no longer hold to the limitation determined by their formation. The dodecaphonic series loses its significance as a concrete model of shape is played out. And the chromatic total remains active only, and provisionally, as a general reference.

This ordered set, often called a row, allowed for new forms of expression and the expansion of underlying structural organizing principles without recourse to common practice harmony .

It just says: Use all the components of any given number of elements, dont leave out individual elements, use them all with equal importance and try to find an equidistant scale so that certain steps are no larger than others.

One way this was achieved was by the development of the concept of groups , which allows structural relationships to be defined not only between individual notes but also at higher levels, up to the overall form of a piece. This is a structural method par excellence , and a sufficiently simple conception that it remains easily perceptible .

        " , argues that serialisms perceptual opacity ensures its aesthetic inferiority. Lerdahl has in turn been criticized for excluding the possibility of other, non-hierarchical methods of achieving musical coherence, and for concentrating on the audibility of tone rows , and the portion of his essay focussing on Boulezs multiplication technique  has been challenged on perceptual grounds by Stephen Heinemann and Ulrich . Ruwets critique has also been criticised for making the fatal mistake of equating visual presentation with auditive presentation .     Within the community of modern music, exactly what constituted serialism was also a matter of debate. The conventional English usage is that the word serial applies to all twelve-tone music, which is a subset of serial music, and it is this usage that is generally intended in reference works. Nevertheless, a large body of music exists that is called serial but does not employ note-rows at all, let alone twelve-tone technique, e.g., Stockhausens Klavierstücke I–IV , as well as his  Stimmung  , and Pousseurs  Scambi  .     When serialism is not limited to twelve-tone techniques, a contributing problem is that the word serial is seldom if ever defined. In many published analyses of individual pieces the term is used while actual meaning is skated around .          Due to the pioneering work of composer-theorist ": null

The basis for serial composition is Schoenbergs twelve-tone technique, where the twelve notes of the basic chromatic scale are organized into a row. This basic row is then used to create permutations, that is, rows derived from the basic set by reordering its elements. The row may be used to produce a set of intervals, or a composer may derive the row from a particular succession of intervals. A row that uses all of the intervals in their ascending form once is an ": null

        ". In addition to permutations, the basic row may have some set of notes derived from it, which is used to create a new row. These are derived sets.     Because there are tonal chord progressions that use all twelve notes, it is possible to create pitch rows with very strong tonal implications, and even to write tonal music using twelve-tone technique. Most tone rows contain subsets that can imply a ": null

To serialize other elements of music, a system quantifying an identifiable element must be created or defined .

The selected set or sets, their permutations and derived sets form the basic material with which the composer works.     Composition using twelve-tone serial methods focuses on each appearance of the collection of twelve chromatic notes, called an ": null

        ". The principle is that no element of the aggregate should be reused until all of the other members have been used, and each member must appear only in its place in the series. This rule is violated in numerous works still termed serial .     An aggregate may be divided into subsets, and all the members of the aggregate not part of any one subset are said to be its complement. A subset is self-complementing if it contains half of the set and its complement is also a permutation of the original subset. This is most commonly seen with hexachords or six-note segments from a basic tone row. A hexachord that is self-complementing for a particular permutation is referred to as prime combinatorial. A hexachord that is self-complementing for all of the canonic operations—": null

If there are multiple serial sets, or if several parameters are associated with the same set, then a presentation will have these values calculated. Large-scale design may be achieved through the use of combinatorial devices, for example, subjecting a subset of the basic set to a series of combinatorial devices.           ": null
