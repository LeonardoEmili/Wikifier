In multimode fibre, mandrel wrapping is used to eliminate the effect of transient loss , the tendency of high order modes to experience higher loss than lower order modes. Numerical addition of the measured loss of multiple fibre segments and/or components overestimates the loss of the concatenated set if each segment or component has been measured with a full mode power distribution.     In single mode optical fibre measurements, it is used to enforce true single mode propagation at wavelengths near or below the theoretical cutoff wavelength, at which substantial power can exist in a higher order mode group. In this use, it is commonly termed a High Order Mode Filter": null
