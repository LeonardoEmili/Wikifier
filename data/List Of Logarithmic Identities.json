        ", there are many  logarithm ic identities .                  Logarithms and exponentials with the same base cancel each other. This is true because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations .     : b^ x\\text\\mbox_b x     : \\log_b x\\text\\log_b x     Both of the above are derived from the following two equations that define a logarithm:     : b^c x\\text\\log_b c     Substituting  in the left equation gives , and substituting  in the right gives . Finally, replace  with .         Logarithms can be used to make calculations easier. For example, two numbers can be multiplied just by using a logarithm table and adding. The first three operations below assume , and/or  so that  and . Derivations also use the log definitions  and .          Where b , x , and y are positive real numbers and b \\ne 1 . Both c and d are real numbers.     The laws result from canceling exponentials and appropriate law of indices. Starting with the first law:     xy b^ b^ b^ \\Rightarrow \\log_b \\log_b \\log_b + \\log_b     The law for powers exploits another of the laws of indices:     x^y ^y b^ \\Rightarrow \\log_b y \\log_b     The law relating to quotients then follows:     \\log_b \\bigg \\log_b \\log_b + \\log_b \\log_b - \\log_b     \\log_b \\bigg \\log_b - \\log_b     Similarly, the root law is derived by rewriting the root as a reciprocal power:     \\log_b \\log_b \\frac\\log_b         : \\log_b a\\frac     This identity is useful to evaluate logarithms on calculators.
