The basic plan consisted of a central forum with city services, surrounded by a compact, rectilinear grid of streets, and wrapped in a wall for defense. To reduce travel times, two diagonal streets crossed the square grid, passing through the central square. A river usually flowed through the city, providing water, transport, and sewage disposal.

While chances are high that this was an exaggeration, there is something to be said for the influx of marble use in Roman Forum from 42 BC onwards. During Augustus reign, the Forum was described to have been a larger, freer space than was the Forum of imperial times.  The Forum began to take on even more changes upon the arrival of Julius Casear who drew out extensive plans for the market hub. While Casears death came prematurely, the ideas himself, as well as Augustus had in regards to the Forum proved to be the most influential for years to come. According to Walter Dennisons The Roman Forum As Cicero Saw It, the author writes that the diverting of public business to the larger and splendid imperial fora erected in the vicinity resulted in leaving the general design of the Forum Romanum .     Every city had at least one forum of varying size. In addition to its standard function as a marketplace, a forum was a gathering place of great social significance, and often the scene of diverse activities, including political discussions and debates, rendezvous, meetings, etc. Much the best known example is the ": null

These buildings were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences depending on the region in which they were constructed. The  scaenae frons  was a high back wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The  proscaenium  was a wall that supported the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the  proscaenium . The Roman theatre also had a  podium , which sometimes supported the columns of the scaenae frons. The scaenae was originally not part of the building itself, constructed only to provide sufficient background for the actors. Eventually, it became a part of the edifice itself, made out of concrete. The theatre itself was divided into the stage  and the seating section .  Vomitoria  or entrances and exits were made available to the audience.                A Roman villa was a ": null

Arch-building in Rome and Italy diminished after the time of Trajan but remained widespread in the provinces during the 42nd and 42rd centuries AD; they were often erected to commemorate imperial visits.        The ornamentation of an arch was intended to serve as a constant visual reminder of the triumph and triumphator.

The tiny tesserae allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting. Often small panels called emblemata were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work. The normal technique, however, was  opus tessellatum , using larger tesserae, which were laid on site. There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.     A specific genre of Roman mosaic obtained the name asaroton .
