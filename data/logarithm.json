Several important formulas, sometimes called logarithmic identities or logarithmic laws, relate logarithms to one another. All statements in this section can be found in , , or , for example.       The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers being multiplied; the logarithm of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of the logarithms. The logarithm of the -th power of a number is  times the logarithm of the number itself; the logarithm of a -th root is the logarithm of the number divided by . The following table lists these identities with examples. Each of the identities can be derived after substitution of the logarithm definitions x b^ or y b^ in the left hand sides.

The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.

Rescaling the left hand blue area vertically by the factor t and shrinking it by the same factor horizontally does not change its size. Moving it appropriately, the area fits the graph of the function  again. Therefore, the left hand blue area, which is the integral of  from t to tu is the same as the integral from 1 to u. This justifies the equality with a more geometric proof.
