        " has described these shifts as Dunsany moving on after he felt he had exhausted the potential of a style or medium. From the naïve fantasy of his earliest writings, through his early short story work in 1904–1908, he turned to the self-conscious fantasy of The Book of Wonder in 1912, in which he almost seems to be parodying his lofty early style.     Each of his collections varies in mood;  A Dreamers Tales  varies from the wistfulness of Blagdaross to the horrors of Poor Old Bill and Where the Tides Ebb and Flow to the social satire of The Day of the Poll.

        " from  The Book of Wonder , gives a good indication of both the tone and tenor of Dunsanys style at the time:     :The Gibbelins eat, as is well known, nothing less good than man. Their evil tower is joined to Terra Cognita, to the lands we know, by a bridge. Their hoard is beyond reason; avarice has no use for it; they have a separate cellar for emeralds and a separate cellar for sapphires; they have filled a hole with gold and dig it up when they need it. And the only use that is known for their ridiculous wealth is to attract to their larder a continual supply of food. In times of famine they have even been known to scatter rubies abroad, a little trail of them to some city of Man, and sure enough their larders would soon be full again.       After  The Book of Wonder , Dunsany began to write plays – many of which were even more successful, at the time, than his early story collections – while also continuing to write short stories. He continued to write plays for the theatre into the 1930s, including the famous If, and a number for radio production. ": null

Although many of Dunsanys stage plays were successfully produced within his lifetime, he also wrote a number of chamber plays , which were intended only to be read privately or performed on the radio, rather than staged . Some of Dunsanys chamber or radio plays contain supernatural events – such as a character spontaneously appearing out of thin air, or vanishing in full view of the audience, without any explanation of how the effect is to be staged, a matter of no importance, since Dunsany did not intend these works actually to be performed live and visible.       Following a successful lecture touring in the US in 1919–1920 and with his reputation now principally related to his plays, Dunsany temporarily reduced his output of short stories, concentrating on plays, novels and poetry for a time.

        ".     Launching another phase of his work, Dunsanys first novel,  Don Rodriguez: Chronicles of Shadow Valley , was published in 1922. It is set in a Romantic Spain that never was, and follows the adventures of a young nobleman, Don Rodriguez, and his servant in their search for a castle for Rodriguez. It has been argued that Dunsanys inexperience with the novel form shows in the episodic nature of Don Rodriguez. In 1924, Dunsany published his second novel,  The King of Elflands Daughter , a return to his early style of writing, which is considered by many to be Dunsanys finest novel and a classic in the realm of the fantasy writing. In his next novel,  The Charwomans Shadow , Dunsany returned to the Spanish milieu and to the light style of Don Rodriguez, to which it is related.     Though his style and medium shifted frequently, Dunsanys thematic concerns remained essentially the same. Many of Dunsanys later novels had an explicitly Irish theme, from the semi-autobiographical  The Curse of the Wise Woman  to His Fellow Men.     One of Dunsanys best-known characters was ": null

From his tales, it was obvious that Mr Jorkens had travelled to all seven continents, was extremely resourceful, and well-versed in world cultures, but always came up short on becoming rich and famous. The Jorkens books, which sold well, were among the first of a type which was to become popular in fantasy and science fiction writing: extremely improbable club tales told at a gentlemans club or bar.     Dunsanys writing habits were considered peculiar by some. Lady Beatrice said that He always sat on a crumpled old hat while composing his tales. Dunsany almost never rewrote anything; everything he ever published was a first draft. ": null

It has been said that Lord Dunsany would sometimes conceive stories while hunting, and would return to the Castle and draw in his family and servants to re-enact his visions before he set them on paper.       Dunsanys work was translated from an early stage, to languages including Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Czech and Turkish.
