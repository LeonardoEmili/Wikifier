While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear. For matrices over non-commutative rings, properties 8 and 9 are incompatible for , In a non-commutative setting left-linearity should be distinguished from right-linearity. Assuming linearity in the columns is taken to be left-linearity, one would have, for non-commuting scalars a, b:   : ab   ab \\left|\\begin1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end \\right|   a \\left|\\begin1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b\\end \\right|   \\left|\\begina & 0 \\\\ 0 & b\\end \\right|   b \\left|\\begina & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end \\right|   ba \\left|\\begin1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end \\right| ba,       a contradiction. There is no useful notion of multi-linear functions over a non-commutative ring. so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.     Property 2 above implies that properties for columns have their counterparts in terms of rows:   Viewing an  matrix as being composed of n rows, the determinant is an n-linear function.   This n-linear function is an alternating form: whenever two rows of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0.   Interchanging any pair of columns or rows of a matrix multiplies its determinant by  −1. This follows from properties 8 and 10 .

Adding a scalar multiple of one column to another column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of properties 8 and 10 in the following way: by property  8 the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property  10.
