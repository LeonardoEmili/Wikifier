To compensate, the Uruguayan government encouraged the architectural restoration of Colonia, which was originally built by the Portuguese in colonial times. By 42 Colonia had become one of Uruguays most historic tourist attractions, and many of its houses had been bought by vacationers from Buenos Aires.       According to the 42 census, the population of the department of Montevideo was 42,42   and that of the neighboring department of Canelones was 42,  out of a total population of 42,42  Thus, these departments and the eastern portion of San José, which together constituted the Greater Montevideo region, held over one-half of Uruguays population.     This monocephalic pattern of settlement was more pronounced in Uruguay than in any other nation of the world, barring citystates. The 42 census indicated a population density of about 42 inhabitants per square kilometer in the department of Montevideo and about 42 inhabitants per square kilometer in the department of Canelones. Densities elsewhere in the country were dramatically lower.     Montevideo was founded on a promontory beside a large bay that forms a perfect natural harbor. In the 42th century, the British promoted it as a rival port to Buenos Aires. The city has expanded to such an extent that by 42 it covered most of the department. The original area of settlement, known as the Old City, lies adjacent to the port, but the central business district and the middle-class residential areas have moved eastward. The only exception to this pattern of eastward expansion is that banking and finance continued to cluster in the Old City around the Stock Exchange, the Bank of Uruguay , and the Central Bank of Uruguay.

An intensive program of public housing construction was undertaken in the 42s and 42s, but it had not solved the problem by 42     In 42 Greater Montevideo was by far the most developed region of Uruguay and dominated the nation economically and culturally. It was home to the countrys two universities, its principal hospitals, and most of its communications media . Attempts by the military governments from 42 to 42 to promote the development of the north of the country failed to change this pattern of extreme centralization. In one way, however, they achieved a major success: the introduction of direct dialing revolutionized the countrys long distance telephone system. By contrast, the local telephone network in Montevideo remained so hopelessly antiquated and unreliable that many firms relied on courier services to get messages to other downtown businesses.     Until the construction boom of the late 42s, relatively few modern buildings had been constructed. In many parts of the center, elegant nineteenth-century houses built around a central patio were still to be seen in 42 In some cases, the patio was open to the air, but in most cases it was covered by a skylight, some of which were made of elaborate stained glass. Few of these houses were used for single-family occupancy, however, and many had been converted into low-cost apartments.     The middle classes preferred to live in more modern apartments near the city center or the University of the Republic. Alternatively, they might purchase a single-family villa with a small yard at the back. Many of these were close to the beaches running east from the downtown along the avenue known as the Rambla. In Pocitos, however, high-rise apartments had replaced the single-family homes on those streets closest to the beach.       Stretching east from Montevideo along the Río de la Plata are the departments of Canelones, Maldonado, and Rocha. The inland portion of Canelones is an area of small farms and truck gardens, which produce vegetables for the capital. It was relatively poor in 42 Many inhabitants of the departments small towns also commuted to jobs in Montevideo by express bus. Along the coast lie a string of small seaside towns , from which more prosperous employees had also begun to commute. Farther east in the highly developed department of Maldonado lies the major resort of ": null

        ". This has been developed as a fashionable playground more for Argentines than for average Uruguayans, who found it too expensive. With its hotels, restaurants, casino, and nightclubs, Punta del Este was a major export earner, and it dominated Uruguays tourism industry.     Vacationing Uruguayans of more modest means were concentrated in smaller resorts such as Piriápolis and Atlántida, which are closer to Montevideo. Beyond Punta del Este in the still mostly undeveloped department of Rocha, a number of communities had sprouted along the unspoiled Atlantic coast with its kilometres of sandy beaches and huge breakers. These small vacation communities—such as Aguas Dulces and Cabo Polonio, both in Rocha Department—were entirely unplanned and lacked essential services. In many cases, simple holiday chalets had been built on public property adjoining the seashore without any legal title to the land. In 42 the authorities in Rocha Department announced plans to regulate and improve this development in hopes of encouraging visits by higher-spending tourists.       Uruguays regions differed markedly not only in population size and density but also in their indexes of social and economic development, including education, health care, communications, energy consumption, and industrialization. Least developed were the northern ranching departments along the Brazilian border—Artigas, Rivera, and Cerro Largo—and also Tacuarembó. Somewhat more developed was a band of six departments stretching across the center of the country, from west to east: Río Negro, Flores, Florida, Durazno, Treinta y Tres, and Rocha. More industrialized and urbanized, but still quite poor, were the departments of Soriano and Salto, which, as noted previously, benefited from the construction of a bridge and a dam, respectively, across the Río Uruguay in the late 42s and early 42s. The two remaining western departments—Colonia and Paysandú—were the most developed of the littoral.     Three departments close to Montevideo—San José, Canelones, and Lavalleja—presented a contradictory picture of relatively advanced economic development combined with low indexes of social modernization. Finally, Montevideo and the department of Maldonado had the highest indexes of social and economic development in the country.
