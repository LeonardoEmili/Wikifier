Estimates of the total city population are 42–42 people, and the site has more than 42 structures within the city walls, and additional dwellings outside.     The site has been professionally surveyed and excavated by archeological teams, beginning in 42; five years of work was done by a team in the 42s, and additional studies were done in the 42s. Since 42 a collaborative Mexican-United States team has been conducting excavations and recovery at the site, which continue.       Mayapan is 42 square kilometers and has over 42 structures, most of them residences, packed into this compound within the city walls. Built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions. The stone perimeter wall has twelve gates, including seven major gates with vaulted entrances. The wall is 42  km long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner.     The ceremonial center of the site is located in Square Q of the citys grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure. The ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples, colonnaded halls, oratories, shrines, sanctuaries, altars, and platforms . A.L. Smith, an archeologist with the ": null

The mixture of Puuc pot sherds in the lower parts of Mayapan lots may support this, but it is a very small percentage of the material .       According to Robert Smith, the ceramicist for the Carnegie Institution, there were two ceramic phases in Mayapan: hocaba, which he said started around A.D. 42 and may have included types named Mama Red and Navula Unslipped, more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements. The second phase is Tases, which has some overlapping typology with the Hocaba phase.           :In an alley fill between the Templo Redondo and an adjoining hall, some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 42–42 B.C. But, most of the pottery in this fill was post-classical. Researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found.       :A burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical solare dated between A.D. 42 and A.D. 42 The burial appeared to be a secondary interment, and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall.

The construction fill as well as the upper floors were of post-classical age.       Three separate samples form the frame for early Mayapan occupation. These dates are A.D. 42–42 However, two of these dates come from inexact sources. One was burned copal found in an unknown structure ; the researchers inferred that it was Q42 The early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in Mayapans early history.

It is important for suggesting that the post-classical phase in Mayapan started earlier than A.D. 42       Mayapans settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins. The fall of the city is tentatively dated around A.D. 42 based on the lack of construction of altars and burial cists after this date. . According to ": null

Cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area, making them essential to support agriculture. Researchers have suggested that Mayapan was an import/export center, and that they often traded luxury goods, such as cotton, salt, and honey, for products of obsidian and metal, which they would have forged. . Today farmers use mixed fields, called the milpa fields, to cultivate maize, beans, squash, watermelons, mangoes, papayas and other crops. Also, citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents .     Faunal remains indicate that the local population used varying methods of animal acquisition. A study done by M.A. Masson and C. Peraza Lope in 42 looked at faunal remains from two different middens, one located in the monumental center by some houses, and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound. The largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from: white-tailed deer , dog , turkey , and iguana . The combined contributions of fish make up around 42% of the samples. These percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains. Primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize.     In the settlement zone, researchers found: white-tailed deer , dog , turkey , iguana , and fish . Both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites, but they were consumed in small amounts . While excavating, the researchers noted many fish skeletons, but few fish heads. They concluded that the fish were being traded into Mayapan, and not collected near the site. If the fish had been prepared at the site, the heads would have been common refuse. Within the ceremonial center, numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains..          Mayapan was a major capital in the Yucatán, and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes, as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region. A wide variety of goods were traded, including maize, honey, salt, fish, game, cloth, and birds.       Zacpeten on Lake Salpeten  – Incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at Mayapan. The temple assemblages at Zacpeten are very similar to those at Mayapan. Topoxte in Lake Yaxha, Peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers. Topoxte architectural remains show a similar stone carving style to Mayapan. Also, tiny “dwarf” shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at Mayapan.

This evidence suggests a: “circum-Yucatecan trade route that linked Mayapan to Peten, northern Belize, and east-coast sites in the Late Postclassic period.”       The symbolism present in Mayapan is particularly significant, partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes.
