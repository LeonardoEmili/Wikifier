And while he was by then recognized as one of the countrys leading playwrights, his inner drive kept him writing:        Simon also drew extensively on his own life and experience for his stories, with settings typically in working-class New York City neighborhoods, similar to ones in which he grew up. In 1983, he began writing the first of three autobiographical plays,  Brighton Beach Memoirs  ,  Biloxi Blues  and  Broadway Bound  . With them, he received his greatest critical acclaim.

However, he was disappointed with the film, and tried to control his film screenplays thereafter. Many of his earlier screenplays were similar to the play, a characteristic Simon observed in hindsight: I really didnt have an interest in films then , he explains.

There is always an implied seeking for solutions to human problems through relationships with other people Simon is able to deal with serious topics of universal and enduring concern , writes biographer Edythe McGovern, while still making people laugh.      She adds that one of Simons hallmarks is his great compassion for his fellow human beings,  an opinion similar to that of author Alan Cooper, who states that Simons plays are essentially about friendships, even when they are about marriage or siblings or crazy aunts  ...

    {
        ", which gives them an urban flavor. Within that setting, Simons themes, besides marital conflict, sometimes include infidelity, sibling rivalry, adolescences, bereavement, and fear of aging. And despite the serious nature of the themes, Simon continually managed to tell the stories with humor, developing the theme to include both realism and comedy.  Simon said he would tell aspiring comedy playwrights not to try to make it funny  ... try and make it real and then the comedy will come.      When I was writing plays, he says, I was almost always writing a drama that was funny  ... I wanted to tell a story about real people.  Simon explained how he managed this combination:        In marriage relationships, his comedies often portray these struggles with plots of marital difficulties or fading love, sometimes leading to separation, divorce and child custody battles. Their endings typically conclude, after many twists in the plot, to renewal of the relationships.      Politics seldom have any overt role in Simons stories, and his characters avoid confronting society despite their personal problems. Simon is simply interested in showing human beings as they are—with their foibles, eccentricities, and absurdities.  Drama critic ": null

    {
        " noted that Simons popularity relies on his ability to portray a painful comedy, where characters say and do funny things in extreme contrast to the unhappiness they are feeling.      Simons plays are generally semi-autobiographical, often portraying aspects of his troubled childhood and first marriages. According to Koprince, Simons plays also invariably depict the plight of white middle-class Americans, most of whom are New Yorkers and many of whom are Jewish, like himself.  He states, I suppose you could practically trace my life through my plays.  In plays such as Lost in Yonkers, Simon suggests the necessity of a loving marriage, opposite to that of his parents, and when children are deprived of it in their home, they end up emotionally damaged and lost .      One of the key influences on Simon is his Jewish heritage, says Koprince, although he is unaware of it when writing. For example, in the Brighton Beach trilogy, she explains, the lead character is a master of self-deprecating humor, cleverly poking fun at himself and at his Jewish culture as a whole.  Simon himself has said that his characters are people who often self-deprecating and usually see life from the grimmest point of view,  explaining, I see humor in even the grimmest of situations. And I think its possible to write a play so moving it can tear you apart and still have humor in it. This theme in writing, notes Koprince, belongs to a tradition of Jewish humor  ... a tradition which values laughter as a defense mechanism and which sees humor as a healing, life-giving force.        Simons characters are typically portrayed as imperfect, unheroic figures who are at heart decent human beings , according to Koprince, and she traces Simons style of comedy to that of ": null

    },
    {
        ", a playwright of ancient Greece. Menander, like Simon, also used average people in domestic life settings, the stories also blending humor and tragedy into his themes.  Many of Simons most memorable plays are built around two-character scenes, as in segments of California Suite and Plaza Suite.     Before writing, Simon tries to create an image of his characters. He said that the play  Star Spangled Girl , which was a box-office failure, was the only play I ever wrote where I did not have a clear visual image of the characters in my mind as I sat down at the typewriter.  Simon considered character building an obligation, stating that the trick is to do it skillfully .  While other writers have created vivid characters, they have not created nearly as many as Simon did: Simon has no peers among contemporary comedy playwrights, stated biographer Robert Johnson.      Simons characters often amuse the audience with sparkling zingers, believable due to Simons skill with writing dialogue. He reproduces speech so adroitly that his characters are usually plausible and easy for audiences to identify with and laugh at.  His characters may also express serious and continuing concerns of mankind  ... rather than purely topical material .  McGovern notes that his characters are always impatient with phoniness, with shallowness, with amorality , adding that they sometimes express implicit and explicit criticism of modern urban life with its stress, its vacuity, and its materialism.  However, Simons characters are never seen thumbing their noses at society.        The key aspect most consistent in Simons writing style is comedy, situational and verbal, and presents serious subjects in a way that makes audiences laugh to avoid weeping.  He achieved this with rapid-fire jokes and wisecracks,  in a wide variety of urban settings and stories.  This creates a sophisticated, urban humor , says editor Kimball King, and results in plays that represent middle America.  Simon created everyday, apparently simple conflicts with his stories, which became comical premises for problems which needed be solved.      Another feature of his writing is his adherence to traditional values regarding marriage and family.  McGovern states that this thread of the monogamous family runs through most of Simons work, and is one he feels is necessary to give stability to society.  Some critics have therefore described his stories as somewhat old fashioned, although Johnson points out that most members of his audiences are delighted to find Simon upholding their own beliefs.  And where infidelity is the theme in a Simon play, rarely, if ever, do those characters gain happiness: In Simons eyes, adds Johnson, divorce is never a victory.      Another aspect of Simons style is his ability to combine both comedy and drama. Barefoot in the Park, for example, is a light romantic comedy, while portions of Plaza Suite were written as farce , and portions of California Suite are high comedy .      Simon was willing to experiment and take risks, often moving his plays in new and unexpected directions. In  The Gingerbread Lady , he combined comedy with tragedy;  Rumors  is a full-length farce; in  Jakes Women  and  Brighton Beach Memoirs  he used dramatic narration; in  The Good Doctor , he created a pastiche of sketches around various stories by ": null

        ".  Although some of these efforts failed to win approval from many critics, Koprince claims that they nonetheless demonstrate Simons seriousness as a playwright and his interest in breaking new ground.        During most of his career Simons work received mixed reviews, with many critics admiring his comedy skills, much of it a blend of humor and pathos .  Other critics were less complimentary, noting that much of his dramatic structure was weak and sometimes relied too heavily on gags and one-liners. As a result, notes Kopince, literary scholars had generally ignored Simons early work, regarding him as a commercially successful playwright rather than a serious dramatist.  ": null

Although, when Lost in Yonkers was considered by the Pulitzer Advisory Board, board member Douglas Watt noted that it was the only play nominated by all five jury members, and that they judged it a mature work by an enduring American playwright.

McGovern attempts to explain the response of many critics:        Similarly, literary critic Robert Johnson explains that Simons plays have given us a rich variety of entertaining, memorable characters who portray the human experience, often with serious themes. Although his characters are more lifelike, more complicated and more interesting than most of the characters audiences see on stage, Simon has not received as much critical attention as he deserves.
