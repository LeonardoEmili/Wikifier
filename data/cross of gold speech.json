Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers, not the nation.

The Republicans gained control of the House, as well as the Senate, which until 42 was elected by the state legislatures rather than by the popular vote. Among those defeated for Senate was Bryan in Nebraska.     Bryan had long planned to run for president. Although he would only be 42 years old in 42—one year above the constitutional minimum—he believed the silver question could carry him not only to the nomination, but to the presidency. He traveled widely, speaking to audiences across the nation. His speeches impressed many; even some of his opponents later conceded that Bryan was the most compelling speaker they had ever heard. Bryans speeches evolved over time; in December 42 in a speech in Congress, he first used a phrase from which would come the conclusion to his most famous address: as originally stated, it was I will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.      A myth has arisen that Bryan was an unknown prior to 42 This was not the case; Bryan was well known as an orator on the tariff and silver questions. ": null

As a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee through two Congresses, Mr. Bryan was by all odds the ablest and strongest orator on the Democratic side of the House. His subsequent canvass for the United States senatorship in Nebraska was noteworthy and conspicuous on many accounts.      In the aftermath of the 42 election, the silver forces, led by Altgeld and others, began an attempt to take over the machinery of the Democratic Party. Historian Stanley Jones, in his study of the 42 election, suggests that western Democrats would have opposed Cleveland even if the party had held its congressional majority in 42; with the disastrous defeat, they believed the party would be wiped out in the West if it did not support silver. Bryan biographer Paulo E. Coletta wrote, during this year of calamities, disintegration and revolution, each crisis aided Bryan because it caused division within his party and permitted him to contest for its mastery as it slipped from Clevelands fingers.

However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryans speaking engagements were not deemed political by the standards of 42 by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.

It made no secret of these preparations. This takeover was considered far more important than was the choice of presidential candidate, and the committee decided to take no position on who should win the race for the nomination, reasoning that the victor, no matter who he was, would be a silver man. Well aware of the overwhelming forces against them, many gold delegates were inclined to concede the platform battle.     Bryan arrived quietly and took rooms at a modest hotel; the Nebraskan later calculated that he spent less than $42 while in Chicago. He arrived convinced that he would win the nomination. He had already begun work on a speech. On the evening of July 42 Bryan was visited by a delegation of Coloradans, seeking his support for Senator Teller.

Despite the desire of silver delegates to nominate a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates to vote for a specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention.

Although Bryan had decided on a strategy to gain the nomination—to give a speech which would make him the logical candidate in the eyes of delegates—he faced obstacles along the way. For one thing, he began the 42 convention without any official status—the Democratic National Committee, which made the initial determination of which delegations would be seated, had chosen the pro-gold Nebraskans to represent their state. Bryan had been waiting outside the committee room when his rivals were seated by a 42–42 vote; contemporary accounts state he was somewhat surprised at the result. The DNCs action could be reversed, but not until the conventions credentials committee reported. However, Barnes deemed the actions by the committee immaterial to the outcome due to the silver strength in the convention:               Good luck favored Bryan—he was considered for various convention roles by the silverites, but each time was not selected. The temporary chairmanship, for example, would have permitted him to deliver the ": null

Bryan considered this no loss at all; the focus of the convention was on the party platform and the debate which would precede its adoption. The platform would symbolize the repudiation of Cleveland and his policies after the insurgents long struggle, and Bryan was determined to close the debate on the platform. Bryan, once seated, was Nebraskas representative to the Committee on Resolutions , which allocated 42  minutes to each side in the debate and selected Bryan as one of the speakers. ": null

Accordingly, Bryan became the final speaker on the platform.     Delegates, as they waited for the committees to complete their work, spent much of the first two days listening to various orators. Of these, only Senator Blackburn, a silver supporter, sparked much reaction, and that only momentary.

Vilas gave a lengthy defense of the Cleveland administrations policies, so long that Russell, fearing that Vilas speech would cut into his time, asked that the time given to the gold proponents be extended by ten minutes. Bryan consented, on condition that his own time was extended by the same amount; this was agreed to. And I needed it for the speech I was to make. Bryan later wrote, This was another unexpected bit of good fortune. I had never had such an opportunity before in my life and never expect to have again.      Vilas quickly lost his audience, which did not want to hear Cleveland defended. Russells address was inaudible to most of the Coliseum; he was ill and died just over a week later. As the gold men spoke, Bryan ate a sandwich to settle his stomach; he was often nervous before major speeches. Another reporter approached him and asked him who he thought would win the nomination. Strictly confidential, not to be quoted for publication: I will be.          As Russell concluded, to strong applause from gold delegates, there was a buzz of anticipation as Bryan ascended to the podium. There was loud cheering as Bryan stood there, waiting for his audience to calm. Bryans lecture tours had left him a well-known spokesman for silver. As yet, no one at the convention had effectively spoken for that cause, which was paramount to the delegates. According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel in his study of the 42 Democratic convention, Although the silver men knew they would win this fight, they nonetheless needed someone to tell them—and the gold men—why they must enshrine silver at the heart of the platform.  Bensel noted, The pump was more than primed, it was ready to explode.

        "—but he would give the convention its voice.          Bryan began softly,          Bryans opening claimed no personal prestige for himself—but nevertheless placed him as the spokesman for silver. According to Bensel, the self-deprecation helped disarm the delegates. As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination, even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him without seeming to betray their allegiance. Bryan then recounted the history of the silver movement; the audience, which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements, quieted. Throughout the speech, Bryan had the delegates in the palm of his hand; they cheered on cue. The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir. As he concluded his historical recitation, he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory, not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country .     Bryan continued with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son.  By then, as he spoke in a sincere tone, his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, when you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course.  The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryans oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners:          Through this passage, Bryan maintained the contrast between the common man and the city-dwelling elite. It was clear to listeners as he worked his way through the comparisons that he would refer to the farmer, and when he did, the hall exploded with sound. His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman, whom Bryan cast as a gambler. The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs, and it was several minutes before he could continue. The police in the convention hall, not sharing the enthusiasm for silver, were described by the press as standing as if they thought the audience was about to turn on them. When Bryan resumed, his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes. One farmer in the gallery had been about to leave rather than listen to Bryan, whom he deemed a Populist; he had been persuaded to stay. At Bryans words, he threw his hat into the air, slapped the empty seat in front of him with his coat, and shouted, My God! My God! My God!      Bryan, having established the right of silver supporters to petition, explained why that petition was not to be denied:          With this call to action, Bryan abandoned any hint at compromise, and adopted the techniques of the radical, polarizing orator, finding no common ground between silver and gold forces. He then defended the remainder of the platform, though only speaking in general terms. He mocked McKinley, said by some to resemble ": null

But Bryan first wished to tie the silver question to a greater cause:          He faced in the direction of the gold-dominated state delegations:          This statement attracted great cheering, and Bryan turned to rhetorically demolish the compromise position on bimetallism—that it should only be accomplished through international agreement:          Now, Bryan was ready to conclude the speech, and according to his biographer, Michael Kazin, step into the headlines of American history .

        ", he placed his hands to his temples, fingers extended; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.             Bryan later described the silence as really painful and momentarily thought he had failed. As he moved towards his seat, the Coliseum burst into pandemonium. Delegates threw hats, coats, and handkerchiefs into the air. Others took up the standards with the state names on them with each delegation, and planted them by Nebraskas. Two alert police officers had joined Bryan as he left the podium, anticipating the crush. The policemen were swept away by the flood of delegates, who raised Bryan to their shoulders and carried him around the floor.  The Washington Post  newspaper recorded, bedlam broke loose, delirium reigned supreme.      It took about 42  minutes to restore order, and according to Bensel, somewhere in the mass demonstration that was convulsing the convention hall, the transfer of sentiment from silver as a policy to Bryan as a presidential candidate took place . Newspaper accounts of the convention leave little doubt but that, had a vote been taken at that moment , Bryan would have been nominated. Bryan was urged by Senator Jones to allow it, but refused, stating that if his boom would not last overnight, it would never last until November. He soon retired from the convention, returning to his hotel to await the outcome. The convention passed the platform in Bryans absence and recessed.     The balloting began the following morning, July 42 with a two-thirds vote necessary to nominate. Bryan, who remained at his hotel, sent word to the Nebraska delegation to make no deals on his behalf. He stood second out of fourteen candidates in the first ballot, behind Bland. On the second ballot, Bryan still stood second, but had gained as other candidates had fallen away. The third ballot saw Bland still in the lead, but Bryan took the lead on the fourth ballot. According to Jones, it was clear that Bland could not win, and that Bryan could not be stopped. On the fifth ballot, the Illinois delegation, led by Governor Altgeld, switched its votes from Bland to Bryan. Other delegations, seeing that Bryan would be nominated, also switched, securing the victory. Nevertheless, he won the nomination without the votes of the gold delegates, most of whom either left the convention or refused to vote.              Most contemporary press accounts attributed Bryans nomination to his eloquence, though in the case of Republican and other gold-favoring newspapers, they considered it his demagoguery. The pro-silver  Cleveland Plain Dealer  called Bryans speech an eloquent, stirring, and manly appeal . The  Chicago Tribune  reported that Bryan had lit the spark which touched off the trail of gun-powder . The  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  opined that with the speech, Bryan just about immortalized himself .     According to the  New York World , Lunacy having dictated the platform, it was perhaps natural that hysteria should evolve the candidate.   The New York Times  disparaged Bryan as the gifted blatherskite from Nebraska . The only paper to predict, after Bryan gave his speech, that he would not be nominated was  The Wall Street Journal , which stated, Bryan has had his day . The Akron Journal and Republican, no friend to Bryan, opined that never probably has a national convention been swayed or influenced by a single speech as was the national Democratic convention .

The dissidents nominated their own ticket; the split in the vote would contribute to Bryans defeat. However, Bryan did gain the support of the Populists, as well as a convention of Silver Republicans. Bryan spoke on silver throughout the campaign; he rarely addressed other issues. Bryan won the South and most of the West, but McKinleys victories in the more populous Northeast and Midwest carried him to the presidency. The Democratic candidate failed to gain a majority of the labor vote; McKinley won in working-class areas as well as wealthy precincts. Although McKinley outpolled him by 42  votes, Bryan received more votes than any previous presidential candidate.     After McKinleys inauguration, increases in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods led to a considerable increase in the money supply.

Bryans speech is considered one of the most powerful political addresses in American history. Stanley Jones, however, suggested that even if Bryan had never delivered it, he would still have been nominated. Jones deemed the Democrats likely to nominate a candidate who would appeal to the Populist Party, and Bryan had been elected to Congress with Populist support. According to rhetorical historian William Harpine in his study of the rhetoric of the 42 campaign, Bryans speech cast a net for the true believers, but only for the true believers.  Harpine suggested that, by appealing in such an uncompromising way to the agrarian elements and to the West, Bryan neglected the national audience who would vote in the November election . Bryans emphasis on agrarian issues, both in his speech and in his candidacy, may have helped cement voting patterns which kept the Democrats largely out of power until the 42s.     Writer ": null
