According to the reference syntax, letter-case is not distinguished in tag names, thus the three tags: & lt;quote & gt; , & lt;QUOTE & gt; , and & lt;quOtE & gt; are equivalent. .       SGML has features for reducing the number of characters required to mark up a document, which must be enabled in the SGML Declaration. SGML processors need not support every available feature, thus allowing applications to tolerate many types of inadvertent markup omissions; however, SGML systems usually are intolerant of invalid structures. XML is intolerant of syntax omissions, and does not require a DTD for checking well-formedness.       Both start tags and end tags may be omitted from a document instance, provided:   the OMITTAG feature is enabled in the SGML Declaration,   the DTD indicates that the tags are permitted to be omitted,   the element has no associated required attributes, and   the tag can be unambiguously inferred by context.     For example, if OMITTAG YES is specified in the SGML Declaration , and the DTD includes the following declarations:               then this excerpt:       Introduction to SGML   The SGML Declaration     ...       which omits two  tags and two  tags, would represent valid markup.     Note also that omitting tags is optional  – the same excerpt could be tagged like this:       Introduction to SGML   The SGML Declaration     ...       and would still represent valid markup.        Note: The OMITTAG feature is unrelated to the tagging of elements whose declared content is EMPTY as defined in the DTD:           Elements defined like this have no end tag, and specifying one in the document instance would result in invalid markup. This is syntactically different than ": null
    },

        "XML": "xml"

    {
        " empty elements in this regard.       Tags can be replaced with delimiter strings, for a terser markup, via the SHORTREF feature. This markup style is now associated with ": null

    },
    {
        ", e.g. wherein two equals-signs after that are the “heading end-tag”.       SGML markup languages whose concrete syntax enables the SHORTTAG VALUE feature, do not require attribute values containing only alphanumeric characters to be enclosed within quotation marks—either double or single —so that the previous markup example could be written:         typically something like this         One feature of SGML markup languages is the presumptuous empty tagging , such that the empty end tag & lt;/ & gt; in & lt;ITALICS & gt;this & lt;/ & gt; inherits its value from the nearest previous full start tag, which, in this example, is & lt;ITALICS & gt; . The expression is thus equivalent to & lt;ITALICS & gt;this & lt;/ITALICS & gt; .       Another feature is the NET construction: & lt;ITALICS/this/ , which is structurally equivalent to & lt;ITALICS & gt;this & lt;/ITALICS & gt; .       Additionally, the SHORTTAG NETENABL IMMEDNET feature allows shortening tags surrounding an empty text value, but forbids shortening full tags:             can be written as         —hence the corresponding construct in XML appears as  .     The third feature is text on the same line, allowing a markup item to be ended with a line-end; especially useful for headings and such, requiring using either SHORTREF or DATATAG minimization. For example, if the DTD includes the following declarations:                     , then:         first line   second line         is equivalent to:         first line   second line           SGML has many features that defied convenient description with the popular formal ": null

The results of parsing can also be understood as a data tree in different notations; where the document is the root node, and entities in other notations are child nodes. SGML provides apparatus for linking to and annotating external non-SGML entities.     The SGML standard describes it in terms of maps and recognition modes . Each entity, and each element, can have an associated notation or declared content type, which determines the kinds of references and tags which will be recognized in that entity and element.

Parsing involves traversing the dynamically-retrieved entity graph, finding/implying tags and the element structure, and validating those tags against the grammar. An unusual aspect of SGML is that the grammar is used both passively  — to recognize lexical structures, and actively  — to generate missing structures and tags that the DTD has declared optional. End- and start- tags can be omitted, because they can be inferred. Loosely, a series of tags can be omitted only if there is a single, possible path in the grammar to imply them. It was this active use of grammars that made concrete SGML parsing difficult to formally characterize.     SGML uses the term validation for both recognition and generation.
