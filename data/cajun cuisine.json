The temperature should not be too high, as a burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable.   Light roux: The secret to making a good gumbo is pairing the roux with the protein. A dark roux, with its strong nutty flavor will completely overpower a simple seafood gumbo, but is the perfect complement to a gumbo using chicken, sausage, crawfish or alligator.  A light roux, on the other hand, is better suited for strictly seafood dishes and unsuitable for meat gumbos for the reason that it does not support the heavier meat flavor as well. Pairing roux with protein follows the same orthodox philosophy as pairing wine with protein.   ": null
