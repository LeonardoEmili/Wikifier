In the essay Going Up To Atlanta, McPherson describes the many odd jobs he took on during this time to help support his mother, brother, and sisters. But it was his discovery of the colored branch of the public library that changed his life. When he started reading books, McPherson learned that words, even without pictures, gave up their secret meanings, spoke of other worlds, made me know that pain was a part of other peoples lives.

While at Harvard, McPherson studied fiction writing with Alan Lebowitz in 1967 and worked on his stories when he found some spare time. It was the publication of his short story Gold Coast in  The Atlantic Monthly , following an open reading competition they had sponsored, that first brought him public recognition. During this period, McPherson established a close working relationship with Edward Weeks, an editor at The Atlantic Monthly, which led to McPherson becoming a contributing editor at that magazine in 1969. His fiction would go on to appear in numerous journals and magazines throughout the following decade. Many of his stories were anthologized, beginning with Gold Coast when it appeared in  The Best American Stories  in 1969. His first collection of short stories, Hue and Cry, was published by Atlantic Monthly Press that year.     In 1971, he received an ": null
