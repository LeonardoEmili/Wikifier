The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.

A motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time.     : \\mathrm \\mathrm \\cdot \\mathrm     If the speed is constant, only multiplication is needed, but if the speed changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum  of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.           When velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given time interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time. For example, travelling a steady 50  mph for 3 hours results in a total distance of 150 miles. In the diagram on the left, when constant velocity and time are graphed, these two values form a rectangle with height equal to the velocity and width equal to the time elapsed. Therefore, the product of velocity and time also calculates the rectangular area under the velocity curve. This connection between the area under a curve and distance traveled can be extended to any irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating velocity over a given time period. If  in the diagram on the right represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled  is the area of the shaded region  .     To approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to divide up the distance between  and  into a number of equal segments, the length of each segment represented by the symbol . For each small segment, we can choose one value of the function . Call that value . Then the area of the rectangle with base  and height  gives the distance  traveled in that segment. Associated with each segment is the average value of the function above it, . The sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the area between the axis and the curve, which is an approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller value for  will give more rectangles and in most cases a better approximation, but for an exact answer we need to take a limit as  approaches zero.

The Leibniz notation  is intended to suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width  becomes the infinitesimally small . In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation     : \\int_a^b \\cdots\\, dx     is to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an output. The terminating differential, , is not a number, and is not being multiplied by , although, serving as a reminder of the  limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations of the integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which the function is integrated and serves as a closing bracket for the integration operator.     The indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:     : \\int f\\, dx.     Functions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant.
