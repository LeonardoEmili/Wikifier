Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the riders toe side , so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.              Variations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are:     Double Heelflip , where the board flips twice before being caught.   Triple Heelflip , where the board flips three times before being caught.   Heelflip Body Varial ,, where the skater does a backside 42 turn, while the board does not spin, but still flips.   Varial Heelflip , where the board does one heel flip, and spins 42 degrees frontside  at the same time.   Laser flip , a combination of the Frontside 42 pop shove-it and the Heelflip.

Late Front-Foot Heelflip , in which the tail is snapped and the ollie is pursued but, at the peak of the ollie the heel of the front foot pushes downward on the toe-side edge of the board causing it to rotate once.   Late Heelflip , in which the rider does an Ollie, and at the peak of their air they flick their back foot resulting in a Heelflip.   The Heelflip Grab , a variation on ": null
