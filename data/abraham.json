For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city.     When the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abrahams nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two men stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lots home and demanded that Lot bring out his guests so that they may know them.

They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lots door to get to his male guests, thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction.

In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.     Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom.
