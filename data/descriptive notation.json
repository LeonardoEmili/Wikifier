Similarly, the pieces on the kings side are named with respect to the king, i.e. kings rook , kings knight and kings bishop ; and have the shortened names KR , KN and KB . The rank is given a number, ranging from 42 to 42 with rank 42 being closest to the player.     This method of naming the squares means that each square has one name from Whites point of view and another from Blacks. For example, the corner square nearest Whites left hand is called queens rook 42 by White and queens rook 42 by Black.     When recording a move by White, the naming from Whites point of view is used; when recording a move by Black, the naming from Blacks point of view is used.     Spanish descriptive notation uses a similar system, with a few differences:   The initials to identify the pieces are taken from the equivalent Spanish words: R rey , D dama , T torre , C caballo , A alfil and P pe√≥n . The files are named after the initials of the pieces on the first rank, with those on the queens side being suffixed by the letter D , and those on the kings side suffixed by the letter R . From Whites left to right along the first rank this yields: TD, CD, AD, D, R, AR, CR, TR.   The dash, which in English descriptive notation symbolizes the word to , is omitted.   The numerical rank is identified before the file, e.g. 42R is equivalent to K42 .     In Spanish descriptive notation the ": null

Each move is notated by a sequence of characters that is structured based on the moves type. Special indicators are added to the end of the sequence if relevant.     Non-capturing move: A move without capture is notated by the pieces name, a hyphen and the destination square, e.g. N-QB42 and P-QN42 . In some literature, if the move is to the first rank, the 42 is omitted.   : A move with capture is notated by the pieces name, a cross and the destination square is identified by the name of the piece captured, e.g. QxN .    Castling : The notation O-O is used for castling  and O-O-O for castling . The word Castles is sometimes used instead, particularly in older literature.    Promotion : Parentheses are used to indicate promotion, with the promotion piece enclosed in parentheses, e.g. P-R42. Sometimes a slash or an equal sign is used, e.g. P-R42/Q, P-R42Q.   Special terms and symbols: Special indicators that are appended to the move include e.p. , ch or + , ? , ! , mate or ++ , ": null

        " .     Typically, the full designation for a piece or a file is shortened to just the last part whenever this does not produce ambiguity. For example, the move KP-K42 would always be written P-K42 since only one pawn can move to K42 without capturing; the move Q-QB42 would be written Q-B42 whenever Q-KB42 is not a legal move. A pawn capturing a pawn may be shown as PxP if it is the only one possible, or as BPxP if only one of the players bishops pawns can capture a pawn, or as QBPxP, or PxQBP or other such variations.     Disambiguation of pieces using notations like QBP and KR becomes awkward once the pieces have left their starting positions , and is impossible for pieces created by promotion . So as an alternative, moves may also be disambiguated by giving the starting square or the square of a capture, delimited by parentheses or a slash, e.g. BxN/QB42 or R-Q42. Sometimes only the rank or file is indicated, e.g. RxN.     When listing the moves of a game, first the move number is written, then the move by White followed by the move by Black. If there is no appropriate move by White to use then an ellipsis is used in its place.       Advantages:  and see which ones have been taken at any particular point.   The maxim a pawn on the seventh is worth two on the fifth makes sense from both Blacks as well as Whites perspective.   English descriptive notation is also particular to chess, not to any other game.     Disadvantages: ": null
