The integration of the MMU made it more cost-effective than the 68020 with an external MMU; it also allowed the 68030 to access memory one cycle faster than a 68020/68851 combo. However, the 68030 can switch between synchronous and asynchronous buses without a reset. The 68030 also lacks some of the 68020s instructions, but it increases performance by & asymp;5% while reducing power draw by & asymp;25% compared to the 68020.     The 68030 can be used with the 68020 bus, in which case its performance is similar to 68020 that it was derived from. However, the 68030 provides an additional synchronous bus interface which, if used, accelerates memory accesses up to 33% compared to an equally clocked 68020. The finer manufacturing process allowed Motorola to scale the full-version processor to 50  MHz. The EC variety topped out at 40  MHz.       The 68030 was used in many models of the ": null
