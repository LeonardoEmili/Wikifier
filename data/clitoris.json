The vestibular bulbs are typically described as lying close to the crura on either side of the vaginal opening; internally, they are beneath the labia majora. When engorged with blood, they cuff the vaginal opening and cause the vulva to expand outward. Although a number of texts state that they surround the vaginal opening, Ginger et al. state that this does not appear to be the case and tunica albuginea does not envelop the erectile tissue of the bulbs. In Yang et al.s assessment of the bulbs anatomy, they conclude that the bulbs arch over the distal urethra, outlining what might be appropriately called the bulbar urethra in women.

This is what leads to clitoral erection.     The clitoral glans doubles in diameter upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible as it is covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds to return to its normal position and 42–42 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women.          General statistics indicate that 42–42 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm. Indirect clitoral stimulation may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina contains nearly 42  percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.

On the basis of their findings, they argued that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot, because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible. In their 42 published study, the coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall . Buisson and Foldès suggested that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoriss root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction .     Researcher Vincenzo Puppo, who, while agreeing that the clitoris is the center of female sexual pleasure and believing that there is no anatomical evidence of the vaginal orgasm, disagrees with OConnell and other researchers terminological and anatomical descriptions of the clitoris and states that the inner clitoris does not exist because the penis cannot come in contact with the congregation of multiple nerves/veins situated until the angle of the clitoris, detailed by ": null

Puppos belief contrasts the general belief among researchers that vaginal orgasms are the result of clitoral stimulation; they reaffirm that clitoral tissue extends, or is at least stimulated by its bulbs, even in the area most commonly reported to be the G-spot.     The G-spot being analogous to the base of the male penis has additionally been theorized, with sentiment from researcher Amichai Kilchevsky that because female fetal development is the default state in the absence of substantial exposure to male hormones and therefore the penis is essentially a clitoris enlarged by such hormones, there is no evolutionary reason why females would have an entity in addition to the clitoris that can produce orgasms. The general difficulty of achieving orgasms vaginally, which is a predicament that is likely due to nature easing the process of child bearing by drastically reducing the number of vaginal nerve endings, challenge arguments that vaginal orgasms help encourage sexual intercourse in order to facilitate reproduction.

She reiterated that the vestibular bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the location of female sexual function and orgasm.

In reduction clitoroplasty, a common intersex surgery, the glans is preserved and parts of the erectile bodies are excised. Problems with this technique include loss of sensation, sexual function, and sloughing of the glans. One way to preserve the clitoris with its innervations and function is to imbricate and bury the clitoral glans; however, Şenaylı et al. state that pain during stimulus because of trapped tissue under the scarring is nearly routine.

Investigators have preferred different operations for different ages of patients .     Gender assessment and surgical treatment are the two main steps in intersex operations. The first treatments for clitoromegaly were simply resection of the clitoris. Later, it was understood that the clitoris glans and sensory input are important to facilitate orgasm, stated Atilla.

In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part  – mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American , Hispanic , and African American , regarding the students beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.     A 42 study reported that, among a sample of undergraduate students, the most frequently cited sources for knowledge about the clitoris were school and friends, and that this was associated with the least amount of tested knowledge. Knowledge of the clitoris by self-exploration was the least cited, but respondents correctly answered, on average, three of the five clitoral knowledge measures . The authors stated that owledge correlated significantly with the frequency of womens orgasm in masturbation but not partnered sex and that their results are discussed in light of gender inequality and a social construction of sexuality, endorsed by both men and women, that privileges mens sexual pleasure over womens, such that orgasm for women is pleasing, but ultimately incidental.

The practice has existed at one point or another in almost all human civilizations, most commonly to exert control over the sexual behavior, including masturbation, of girls and women, but also to change the clitoriss appearance. Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for FGM, with some cultures believing that not performing it has the possibility of disrupting the cohesiveness of their social and political systems, such as FGM also being a part of a girls initiation into adulthood. Often, a girl is not considered an adult in a FGM-practicing society unless she has undergone FGM, and the removal of the clitoris and labia  – viewed by some as the male parts of a womans body  – is thought to enhance the girls femininity, often synonymous with docility and obedience .     Female genital mutilation is carried out in several societies, especially in Africa, with 42 percent of genital mutilations performed in Africa consisting of clitoridectomy or excision, and to a lesser extent in other parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, on girls from a few days old to mid-adolescent, often to reduce sexual desire in an effort to preserve vaginal ": null

In an action similar to pushing up a shirtsleeve, the female retracts the on itself, and creates an opening into which the male inserts his own penis . The male must practice this act, which can take a couple of months to successfully perform. Female spotted hyenas exposed to larger doses of androgen have significantly damaged ovaries, making it difficult to conceive. After giving birth, the pseudo-penis is stretched and loses much of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips. Approximately 42% of the females die during their first time giving birth, and over 42% of their species firstborn young die.     A 42 Baskin et al. study concluded, The basic anatomical structures of the corporeal bodies in both sexes of humans and spotted hyenas were similar. As in humans, the dorsal nerve distribution was unique in being devoid of nerves at the 42 oclock position in the penis and clitoris of the spotted hyena and that rsal nerves of the penis/clitoris in humans and male spotted hyenas tracked along both sides of the corporeal body to the corpus spongiosum at the 42 and 42 oclock positions. The dorsal nerves penetrated the corporeal body and distally the glans in the hyena and, in female hyenas, the dorsal nerves fanned out laterally on the clitoral body. Glans morphology was different in appearance in both sexes, being wide and blunt in the female and tapered in the male .       Researchers studying the peripheral and central afferent pathways from the feline clitoris concluded that afferent neurons projecting to the clitoris of the cat were identified by WGA-HRP tracing in the S42 and S42 dorsal root ganglia. An average of 42 cells were identified on each side of the animal. 42  percent and 42  percent of the labeled cells were located in the S42 and S42 dorsal root ganglia, respectively. The average cross sectional area of clitoral afferent neuron profiles was 42±42 μm42 They also stated that light constant pressure on the clitoris produced an initial burst of single unit firing followed by rapid adaptation and a sustained firing , which was maintained during the stimulation and that further examination of tonic firing indicate that the clitoris is innervated by mechano-sensitive myelinated afferent fibers in the pudental nerve which project centrally to the region of the dorsal commissure in the L42-S42 spinal cord .
