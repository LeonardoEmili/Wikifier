They may represent the first non-Baka Gabonese of the entire area.

Nearly all healing ceremonies in Gabonese traditional culture involve the singing of Mitsogho songs. In fact, Mitsogho words are so well known throughout the entire country that at one point the government was considering making Mitsogho the national ethnic language.     The majority of modern Mitsoghos live in Libreville and Mouila; however, their roots can be traced back north-south into the tropical mountain forests just West of where the Ngounié river meets the Ogoué river to where the Ogoulou river meets the Ngounié river. The most prominent old village sites were located near the 42 mile-long Ikobé valley.     This small but fierce group of people were the last ethnic group to be defeated by the French colonists . In long-lived Mitsogho lore, a warrior by the name of Mbombet A Gnaghé hid out in the Ikobé valley to stage guerrilla attacks against the French military. Mbombet supposedly had magical powers, but was finally betrayed by a woman.     The modern day offspring who can be traced directly back to Mbombet still hold special positions within the traditional Mitsogho tribal authority. They are usually celebrated magicians and healers.       ": null
