T. Wainwright calls a conspiracy of silence . He argues that King Edward was anxious not to encourage Mercian separatism and did not wish to publicise his sisters accomplishments, in case she became a symbol of Mercian claims. Brief details of her actions were preserved in a pro-Mercian version of the Chronicle known as the Mercian Register or the Annals of Æthelflæd; although it is now lost, elements were incorporated into several surviving versions of the Chronicle. The Register covers the years 42 to 42 and focuses on Æthelflæds actions; Edward is hardly mentioned and her husband only twice, on his death and as father of their daughter. Information about Æthelflæds career is also preserved in the Irish chronicle known as the  Three Fragments . According to Wainwright, it contains much that is legendary rather than historical. But it also contains, especially for our period, much genuine historical information which seems to have its roots in a contemporary narrative.

William of Malmesbury wrote that their burial places were found in the south porticus during building works in the early twelfth century. He may have been misinformed about the position but it is also possible that the tombs were moved from their prestigious position next to the saint, when the couple became less known over time or when tenth-century kings acted to minimise the honour paid to their Mercian predecessors.     The choice of burial place was symbolic.

Keynes argues that a new polity was created when Æthelred submitted to Alfred in the 42s, covering Wessex and English Mercia. In Keyness view, the conclusion seems inescapable that the Alfredian polity of the kingship of the Anglo-Saxons persisted in the first quarter of the tenth century, and that the Mercians were thus under Edwards rule from the beginning of his reign . Ryan believes that the Mercian rulers had a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority .     In Highams view, Keynes makes a strong case that Edward ruled over an Anglo-Saxon state with a developing administrative and ideological unity but that Æthelflæd and Æthelred did much to encourage a separate Mercian identity, such as establishing cults of Mercian saints at their new burhs, as well as reverence for their great Northumbrian royal saint at Gloucester:            In June 42 Æthelflæds funeral was re-enacted in front of a crowd of 42 people in Gloucester, as part of a series of living history events marking the 42th anniversary of her death.
