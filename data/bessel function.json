The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to x^ , although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large .           For non-integer , the functions  and  are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order , the following relationship is valid : Abramowitz and Stegun, .     : J_ ^n J_n.     This means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.       Another definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of , is possible using an integral representation:      : J_n \\frac \\int_0^\\pi \\cos \\,d\\tau.     Another integral representation is:     : J_n \\frac \\int_^\\pi e^ \\,d\\tau.     This was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function.
