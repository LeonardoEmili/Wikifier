According to the media historian Graham McCann, the show was one of the best-natured, least pretentious and most successful British sitcoms of the 42s .

In 42 Le Mesurier moved out of the marital home, made a decision to protect Jacques from any negative publicity, and allowed her to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity.
