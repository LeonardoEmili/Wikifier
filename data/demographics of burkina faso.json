Burkina Faso has a young age structure – the result of declining mortality combined with steady high fertility – and continues to experience rapid population growth, which is putting increasing pressure on the country’s limited arable land. More than 65% of the population is under the age of 25, and the population is growing at 3% annually. Mortality rates, especially those of infants and children, have decreased because of improved health care, hygiene, and sanitation, but women continue to have an average of almost 6 children. Even if fertility were substantially reduced, today’s large cohort entering their reproductive years would sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future. Only about a third of the population is literate and unemployment is widespread, dampening the economic prospects of Burkina Faso’s large working-age population.       :20,107,509   :Note: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality and death rates, lower population and growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected          :0-14 years: 44.28%   :15-24 years: 20.19%   :25-54 years: 28.82%   :55-64 years: 3.55%   :65 years and over: 3.16%     :0-14 years: 44.88%   :15-24 years: 20.07%   :25-54 years: 29.42%   :55-64 years: 3.2%   :65 years and over: 2.43%       :total: 17.4 years Country comparison to the world: 218th   :male: 16.6 years   :female: 18.2 years     :Total: 17.3 years   :Male: 17.1 years   :Female: 17.4 years       :2.76% Country comparison to the world: 12th   :3%       :36.9 births/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 14th       :8.7 deaths/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 72nd       :0 migrant/1,000 population Country comparison to the world: 76th       :19.4 years   :note: median age at first birth among women 25-29     ": null
