Khol     The question as to why this area did not remain at the forefront of technological and social development lies in the subsequent history of its geographical location. At the end of the mostly peaceful Neolithic period, this area became a highway for invaders from the east moving into Europe. By the time the historical written record begins to cover this area, it has already seen a number of invasions sweep over it, leaving social and political upheaval in their wake. This trend was to continue on a fairly regular basis up until the 20th century. With so much destruction, it was difficult for the residents of this area to recover from each successive invasion before encountering the next. However, the few societies in this area that managed to survive for a while through these turbulent centuries left behind a culture and history that are rich and dramatic. ": null

Ion Nistor, Istoria Basarabiei, 4th edition, Cartea moldovenească, Chișinău, 1991, p. 179-189     At the end of the Crimean War , in 1856, by the Treaty of Paris , the southern parts of Bessarabia were returned to Moldavia, which organized the territory into the districts of Cahul , Bolgrad and Ismail . Consequently, Russia lost access to the Danube river. In 1859, the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia united and formed the Romanian United Principalities , a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire .     In 1870, the institution of zemstva was instated in the Bessarabian oblast. Cities, communes, counties, and the entire region would elect each a local council representing noblemen, merchants and peasants. They had substantial authority in economic and sanitary areas, including roads, posts, food, public safety and education. On the other hand, political and cultural matters remained an exclusive domain of the Governor General and were used as a vehicle of Russification . With the accomplishment of these introductions, in 1871, Bessarabia was transformed into a governorate. Ion Nistor, p.190-191     The defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War 1877–1878 and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Berlin granted independence to Romania. Although the treaty of alliance between Romania and Russia specified that Russia would defend the territorial integrity of Romania and not claim any part of Romania at the end of the war, the southern part of Bessarabia was re-annexed to Russia. In exchange, Romania was given Dobruja , which was at the time part of the Ottoman Empire. Mitrasca, p. 23.     thu in the 19th century     Public education was entrusted to the religious establishment of the region, which since 1821 had only Russian archbishops, and later also to the zemstvos. Dimitrie Sulima , and Antonie Shokotov allowed the parallel usage of both Romanian and Russian in church, and did not take any measures to infringe upon the linguistic specifics of the region. With the appointment of Pavel Lebedev , the situation changed radically, and the language of the locals was soon purged from the church. To prevent the printing of religious literature in Romanian, Lebedev closed down the printing press in Chișinău , collected from the region and burned the already printed books in Romanian . The following archbishops Sergey Lapidevsky , Isakyi Polozensky , Neofit Novodchikov eased some of Lebedevs measures to help quell the serious dissatisfaction of the population. The next Archbishop Iakov Pyatnitsky discovered that his desire to popularize a Christian culture and a moral education faced a language barrier, and in 1900 convinced the Russian High Synod to allow the publication of religious pamphlets in Romanian, while his follower Archbishop Vladimir allowed the printing of books, and from 1908 even of a regular religious journal Luminătorul by Constantin Popovici and Gurie Grosu . The last Russian Archbishops, Serafim Chichyagov , Platon and Anastasius tried to preserve the privileged status of the Russian language in the church in Bessarabia, but did not introduce any new anti-Romanian measures. In 1918, after the installation of the Romanian administration in Bessarabia, Archbishop Anastasius refused to subordinate his eparchy to the Romanian Orthodox Church , and was forced into exile. The new authorities entrusted the archbishopric to the Bishop Nicodem de Huși from Romania, who appointed a local Archbishop Dionisie Erhan . Then the Clerical Congress on February 21, 1920 elected Gurie Botoșăneanu as the highest church official in Bessarabia, which afterwards was raised from Archbishop to Metropolitan. Ion Nistor, p. 224-244     thu     Under the protection of Gavriil Bănulescu-Bodoni and Dimitrie Sulima a theological school and a seminary were opened in Chișinău, and public schools throughout the region: in the cities of Chișinău, Hotin, Cetatea Albă, Briceni, Bender, Bălți, Cahul, Soroca, Orhei, at the monasteries of Dobrușa and Hârjauca, and even in several villages . In 1835, the tsarist authorities declared a 7-year deadline to transfer the education from Romanian to Russian . Although the measure was implemented more gradually, since 1867, Romanian was purged entirely from the education. This had the effect of keeping the peasant population of Bessarabia backward, as witnessed by the fact that in 1912 Moldavians had a literacy rate of only 10.5%, lowest among all ethnic groups of the region , with a record low 1.7% literacy rate for Moldavian women. Of the 1709 primary schools in Bessarabia in 1912, none was in the language of the main ethnic group. Ion Nistor, p. 249-255   thu water carrier     After 1812, the newly installed Russian authorities expelled the large Nogai Tatar population of Budjak , and encouraged the settlement of Moldavians, Wallachians, Bulgarians, Ukrainians and others through various fiscal facilities and exemption from military service. The colonization was generated by the need to better exploit the resources of the land, Marcel Mitrasca, Moldova: A Romanian Province Under Russian Rule, Algora, 2002, , pg. 25 and by the absence of serfdom in Bessarabia. Ion Nistor, Istoria Basarabiei, Cernăuți, 1921 German colonists from Switzerland , France, and Germany settled in 27 localities in Budjak , and by 1856 Bessarabian Germans were 42,216. Russian veterans of the 1828–1829 war with the Ottomans were settled in 10 localities in Budjak, and three other localities were settled by Cossacks from Dobrudja . Bessarabian Bulgarians and Gagauz arrived from modern eastern Bulgaria as early as the second half of the 18th century. In 1817, they numbered 482 families in 12 localities, in 1856 – 115,000 people in 43 localities. Ukrainians had arrived Bessarabia since before 1812, and already in the 1820s they made up one third of the population of the most northern Hotin county . In the following decades more Ukrainians settled throughout the northern part of Bessarabia from Galicia and Podolia . Jews from Galicia, Podolia and Poland also settled in Bessarabia in the 19th century, but mostly in the cities and fairs; in some of these they eventually became a plurality. In 1856, there were 78,751 Bessarabian Jews and according to the Imperial Russian census of 1897, the capital Kishinev had a Jewish population of 50,000, or 46%, out of a total of approximately 110,000. There was even an attempt by the Russian authorities to create 16 Jewish agricultural colonies, where 10,589 people would settle. However within less than 2 generations, most of them sold the land to the local Moldavians and moved to the cities and fairs. Ion Nistor, p.197-214 The various population movements saw an increase of the Slavic population to more than a fifth of the total population by 1920, : Today, the Bulgarians form one of the most solid elements in Southern Bessarabia, numbering nearly 150,000. Colonization brought in numerous Great Russian peasants, and the Russian bureaucracy imported Russian office-holders and professional men; according to the Romanian estimate of 1920, the Great Russians were about 75,000 in number , and the Lipovans and Cossacks 59,000 ; the Little Russians came to 254,000 . That, plus about 10,000 Poles, brings the total number of Slavs to 545,000 in a population of 2,631,000, or about one-fifth while the proportion of the Moldovan population steadily decreased. In absence of any official records on ethnic distribution until the late 19th century, various figures for the ethnic proportions of the region have been advanced. Thus, in the 1920s Romanian historian Ion Nistor alleged that, at the beginning of the Russian administration, Moldavians represented 86% of the population. Ion Nistor, Istoria Bassarabiei, Cernăuți, 1921 While according to official statistics speakers of Moldovan and Romanian accounted for 47.8% in 1897, Flavius Solomon, Die Republik Moldau und ihre Minderheiten , in: Ethnodoc-Datenbank für Minderheitenforschung in Südostosteuropa, p. 52 some authors proposed figures as high as 70% for the beginning of the 20th century.       thu       After the Russian Revolution of 1905 , a Romanian nationalist movement started to develop in Bessarabia. While it received a setback in 1906–1907, the movement re-emerged even stronger in 1917. Mitrasca, pp. 28–29     To quell the chaos brought about by the Russian revolutions of February and October 1917 , a national council, Sfatul Țării , was established in Bessarabia, with 120 members elected in county meetings of peasants, and by political and professional organizations from Bessarabia. On December 15, 1917, the Council proclaimed the Moldavian Democratic Republic , as part of the Russian Republic , then formed the government of Moldavia. With the approval of the Allies and the Russian White general Dmitry Shcherbachev , commander-in-chief of the Russian forces on the Romanian Front, on January 26, 1918, Romanian troops entered Bessarabia, ostensibly as a temporary measure to maintain security, which had deteriorated due to large numbers of deserters from the Russian Army. , Literatura și Arta, 11 September 2008 Corneliu Chirieș, , Observator de Bacău, 23 March 2008 While Romanian historiography generally asserts the intervention was done on the request of Sfatul Țării, Ion Nistor , Istoria Basarabiei, 4th edition, Chișinău, Cartea moldovenească, 1991, p. 281 Petre P.

The Moldovans: Romania, Russia and the Politics of Culture, Hoover Institution Press, 2000, pg. 35 on , Sfatul Țării, by a vote of 86 to 3, with 36 abstentions, approved a conditional Union of Bessarabia with Romania . Conditions included territorial autonomy of Bessarabia, an agrarian reform, respect for human freedoms and general amnesty. Nevertheless, as early as the summer of 1918 the Romanian government began encroaching on the existing forms of local autonomy. Thus, the members of the zemstvo s were appointed by royal decree, rather than being elected, as had been the case during the Russian rule. The province was subordinated to a royal-appointed General Commissar, and Sfatul Țării was relegated to a consultative position. Furthermore, the state of siege was declared throughout Bessarabia and censorship was instated. Under the pressure of the Romanian central government, worried about the growing dissatisfaction with its administration of the region and the strengthening of the autonomist current, the conditions were nominally dropped by the Sfatul Țării in December 1918.

La Bessarabia e la Grande Romania , Aracne, 2007, pg. 118 The vote was taken in the presence of only 44 of the 125 members, or, according to other sources, 48 of 160; lacking a quorum , the vote was judged to be illegitimate by some. Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture , Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 35     The union was recognized by Britain, France and Italy, but not by the Soviet government, which claimed the area as the Bessarabian Soviet Socialist Republic , and argued the union was made under conditions of Romanian military occupation by a Council that had not been elected by the people of Bessarabia in elections.       thu   After 1918 Bessarabia was under Romanian jurisdiction for the next 22 years. This fact was recognized in the 1920 Treaty of Paris which, however, has never come into force since it was not ratified by Japan. The newly communist Russia did not recognize the Romanian rule over Bessarabia. Wayne S Vucinich, Bessarabia In: ": null

Furthermore, Russia and later, the Soviet Union, considered the region to be Soviet territory under foreign occupation and conducted numerous diplomatic attempts to reclaim it. No diplomatic relations existed between the two states until 1934. During that time, both countries subscribed to the principle of non-violent resolution of territorial disputes in the Kellogg-Briand Treaty of 1928 and the Treaty of London of July 1933. Meanwhile, the neighboring region of Transnistria , part of the Ukrainian SSR at the time, was formed into the Moldavian ASSR after the failure of the Tatarbunary Uprising in 1924.     The land reform , implemented by Sfatul Țării in 1918–1919, resulted in a rise of a middle class , as 87% of the regions population lived in rural areas. The reform was however marred by the small size of the awarded plots, as well as by preferential allotment of land to politicians and administrative personnel who had supported the political goals of the Romanian government. Generally, urban development and industry were insignificant, and the region remained primarily an agrarian rural region throughout the interwar period. Cristina Petrescu, Contrasting/Conflicting Identities: Bessarabians, Romanians, Moldovans in Nation-Building and Contested Identities, Polirom, 2001, pg. 159 Certain improvements were achieved in the area of education, the literacy rate rising from 15.6% in 1897 Charles King , The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000. . p. 23 to 37% by 1930; however, Bessarabia continued to lag behind the rest of the country, the national literacy rate being 60%. During the inter-war period, Romanian authorities also conducted a program of Romanianization that sought to assimilate ethnic minorities throughout the country. The enforcement of this policy was especially pervasive in Bessarabia due to its highly diverse population, and resulted in the closure of minority educational and cultural institutions.

The Agricultural State University of Moldova was founded in 1933 in Chișinău. The Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1939 by the sculptor Alexandru Plămădeală . Gurie Grosu was the first Metropolitan of Bessarabia .     The first scheduled flights to Chișinău started on 24 June 1926, on the route Bucharest – Galați – Iași – Chișinău.

After the establishment of the Soviet Union in December 1922, the Soviet government moved in 1924 to establish the Moldavian Autonomous Oblast on the lands to the east of the Dniester River in the Ukrainian SSR . The capital of the oblast was Balta , situated in present-day Ukraine . Seven months later, the oblast was upgraded to the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic , even though its population was only 30% ethnic Romanian.

On June 26, 1940 the Soviet government issued an ultimatum to the Romanian minister in Moscow, demanding Romania immediately cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Italy and Germany, which needed a stable Romania and access to its oil fields, urged King Carol II to do so. On June 28, Soviet troops crossed the Dniester and occupied Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertza region .     thu , 1941     The Soviet republic created following annexation did not follow Bessarabias traditional border. The Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic , established on August 2, 1940, consisted of six and a half counties of Bessarabia joined with the westernmost part of the already extant MASSR . Various changes were made to its borders, which were finally settled by November 1940. Territories where ethnic Ukrainians formed a large portion of the population went to Ukraine, while a small strip of Transnistria east of the Dniester with a significant Moldovan population was joined to the MSSR. The transfer of Bessarabias Black Sea and Danube frontage to Ukraine insured its control by a stable Soviet republic. This transfer, along with the division of Bessarabia, was also designed to discourage future Romanian claims and irredentism .

King, p. 121     In the 1970s and 80s Moldova received substantial investment from the budget of the USSR to develop industrial, scientific facilities, as well as housing. In 1971 the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a decision About the measures for further development of Kishinev city that secured more than one billion rubles of funds for Chișinău alone from the USSR budget. Subsequent decisions directed large amounts of funds and brought qualified specialists from all over the USSR to further develop the Moldavian SSR. on Kishinev.info, Retrieved on 2008-10-12 Such an allocation of USSR assets was influenced by the fact that the-then leader of the Soviet Union , Leonid Brezhnev , was the First Secretary of the local Communist Party in the 1950s.

In May 1991, the countrys official name was changed to the Republic of Moldova . The name of the Supreme Soviet also was changed, to the Moldovan Parliament.     During the 1991 Soviet coup détat attempt in Moscow against Mikhail Gorbachev, commanders of the Soviet Unions Southwestern Theater of Military Operations attempted to impose a state of emergency in Moldova. They were overruled by the Moldovan government, which declared its support for Russian president Boris Yeltsin , who led the counter-coup in Moscow. On 27 August 1991, following the coups collapse, Moldova declared its independence from the Soviet Union.     The December elections of Stepan Topal and Igor Smirnov as presidents of Gagauzia and Transnistria respectively, and the official dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of the year, had further increased tensions in Moldova.         thu n region of Moldova     Transnistria is the region east of the Dniester River , which includes a large proportion of predominantly Russophone ethnic Russians and Ukrainians . The headquarters of the Soviet 14th Guards Army was located in the regional capital Tiraspol. There, on September 2, 1990, local authorities proclaimed an independent Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic . The motives behind this move were fear of the rise of nationalism in Moldova and the countrys expected reunification with Romania upon secession from the USSR. In the winter of 1991–1992 clashes occurred between Transnistrian forces and the Moldovan police. Between March 2 and July 26, 1992, the conflict escalated into a military engagement. Following an intervention of the 14th Army into the conflict on the side of the separatists, the war was stopped and the Moscow Agreement on the principles of peace settlement of armed conflict in Trans-Dniester districts of the republic of Moldova was signed on 21 July 1992.     As of 2007, the Russian military remains in Transnistria, despite Russia having signed international agreements to withdraw, and against the will of Moldovan government. : I would like to reiterate on this occasion the position of the Republic of Moldova according to which the withdrawal of the Russian troops that remain on the Moldovan territory against its will, in conformity with the obligations assumed by the Russian Federation in 1999 in Istanbul, would create the necessary premises for ratifying and applying the Adapted CFE Treaty.
