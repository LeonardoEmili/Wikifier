Today, the area appeals to artists as well as tourists. Furthermore, the Maria-Magdalenen Church, built in the 42th century is another attraction of the old town of Lauenburg. The old town is nestled at the bottom of about 42 meter high bluffs. The picturesque narrow streets up the hill lead to the so-called upper town where Lauenburg Castle is located. The old Lauenburg Castle used to be the residence of the Dukes of Lauenburg and the political centre of the Dukedom. Over the century most parts were destroyed and replaced by modern buildings. Though, the old castle tower remains till today. Nowadays, the castles serves as city and municipal administration. A walk up to the castle is worth the effort though, because of the view. One cannot only see the beautiful river Elbe and the old town of Lauenburg, but also the flat marshland of Lower-Saxony on the southern shore of the Elbe, which used to belong to the duchy until it was ceded to the then neighbouring ": null
