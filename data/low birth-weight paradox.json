Based on prior research, the children of smoking mothers are more likely to be of low birth weight than children of non-smoking mothers. Thus, by extension the child mortality rate should be higher among children of smoking mothers. So it is a surprising real-world observation that low birth weight babies of smoking mothers have a lower child mortality than low birth weight babies of non-smokers.       At first sight these findings seemed to suggest that, at least for some babies, having a smoking mother might be beneficial to ones health. However the paradox can be explained ": null

However, they still have a lower mortality rate than children who have other, more severe, medical reasons why they are born underweight.     In short, smoking is harmful in that it contributes to low birth weight which has higher mortality than normal birth weight, but other causes of low birth weight are generally more harmful than smoking.       If one corrects and adjusts for the confounding by smoking, via stratification or multivariable regression modelling to statistically control for smoking, one finds that the association between birth weight and mortality may be attenuated towards the null. Nevertheless, most epidemiologic studies of birth weight and mortality have controlled for maternal smoking, and the adjusted results, although attenuated after adjusting for smoking, still indicated a significant association.     Additional support for the hypothesis that birth weight and mortality can be acted on independently came from the analysis of birth data from ": null
