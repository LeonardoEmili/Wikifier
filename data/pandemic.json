Then you might ask yourself: What is a global outbreak? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus.      In planning for a possible influenza pandemic, the WHO published a document on pandemic preparedness guidance in 1999, revised in 2005 and in February 2009, defining phases and appropriate actions for each phase in an aide memoir entitled WHO pandemic phase descriptions and main actions by phase.
