There is a fair amount of evidence to suggest that he never entirely gained emotional control, and he feels bitterness over his Vulcan heritage. He is also shown to exhibit subdued moments of annoyance, self-doubt, sarcasm and even anger .     Despite this internal conflict, he is shown on numerous occasions to be capable of great nobility and altruism.
