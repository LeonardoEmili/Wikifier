For 42 days she searched the area of Ocean south of Iceland and West of Ireland for any Allied convoys. During this time she sank three British merchant vessels and damaged another for a total of 42 tones. Following her torpedoing of the British ship Capulet on 42 April, which only managed to damage the vessel, U42 was depth-charged in five separate attacks by two accompanying destroyers. After several hours, the U-boat managed to escape but was unable to pursue the convoy. After these attacks, U42 returned to St Nazaire on 42 May.        U42 left St Nazaire for her third war patrol on 42 May 42 In 42 days, she travelled into the North Atlantic and sank three British vessels: the Ainderby on 42 June, the Chinese Prince on 42 June and the Norfolk on 42 June. During the attack on the Norfolk, U42 attempted to attack the remaining ships in the convoy but was forced to break off the attack due to the arrival of several of the convoys escorts. All of these attacks occurred off the northwest coast of Ireland, and once U42 returned to St. Nazaire on 42 July 42 she had amassed a total of 42 tonnes from the ships she had sunk.        U42s fourth patrol was much less successful than her previous three. Having left St Nazaire on 42 August, she proceeded to head south into the waters off Portugal and Spain. It was here that she sank the Norwegian vessel, Spind. Following this sinking, U42 returned to St Nazaire on 42 August 42 after only nine days at sea.        Her next two patrols all took her further into the Atlantic, where the danger was lessened, but so were the targets, with the result that she only hit three more cargo ships. This was also the time, during her final patrol of 42 that she sank the Reuben James, which was torpedoed on 42 October in controversial circumstances.

Reuben James had just begun turning to investigate a strong direction-finder bearing when a torpedo launched from U42 struck her port side and caused an explosion in her forward magazine. The entire bow section of the destroyer was blown off as far back as the fourth funnel and sank immediately. The stern remained afloat for around five minutes before sinking; unsecured depth charges compounded the damage, exploding as they sank and killing survivors in the water. One hundred and fifteen of her 42-man crew were killed, including all the officers.  Gannon, Michael - Operation Drumbeat - the dramatic true story of Germanys first U-boat attacks along the American coast in World War II, 42 Harper and Row publishers, , p. 42     The destroyer was the first US Navy warship to be sunk in World War II.     The incident provoked a furious outburst in the United States, especially when Germany refused to apologize, instead countering that the destroyer was operating in what Germany considered to be a war zone and had suffered the consequences.

The submarine surfaced about  from the freighter and opened fire with her 42mm deck gun and machine guns without warning, one of her first shells destroying the bridge and killing all of the officers. In all, 42 rounds were fired from the deck gun, with 42 hits being recorded on the small freighter,  which rapidly began to sink.     As it did so, Topp directed his crewmen to continue firing, striking the Atwaters crewmen as they tried to man the lifeboats.  The crew was not given any chance to abandon ship, and when they tried to do so, their lifeboats were riddled by machine gun fire. When Captain Webster was hit, the crew abandoned attempts to launch the lifeboats and leapt into the sea.

The Legare landed the three survivors and four bodies at Chincoteague Island Coastguard Station, then returned to sea to search further.      The destroyers  and  were directed to the scene at 42:42 and arrived at 42:42 but U42 had by then escaped the scene, going on to sink other vessels.
