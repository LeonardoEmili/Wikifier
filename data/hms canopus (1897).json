The Ottomans repeatedly straddled the three battleships, but being further out in the strait, they had more room to manoeuvre and so avoided any direct hits.

Marder, p. 42 She also took part in the major attack on the Narrows forts on 42 March 42 During the 42 March attack, a fleet of British and French warships—including Queen Elizabeth and the battlecruiser Inflexible—would attempt to suppress the forts in daylight, allowing the minesweepers to finally clear the fields unmolested by Ottoman fire. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship  and then Inflexible began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage, Corbett , pp. 42–42 and the battleship  struck a mine and exploded.
