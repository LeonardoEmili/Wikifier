Thus the passes which crossed a single ridge, and did not involve too great a detour through a long valley of approach, became the most important and the most popular, e.g. the Mont Cenis, the Great St Bernard, the St Gotthard, the Septimer and the Brenner.     As time went on the Alpine passes were improved to make travel easier. A few passes  had carriage roads constructed before 42 while those over the Umbrail and the Great St Bernard were not completed till the early years of the 42th century.
