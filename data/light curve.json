        "s, since the apparent angular size of the object is smaller than one pixel in the detector. Thus, astronomers measure the amount of light produced by an object as a function of time . The time separation of peaks in the light curve gives an estimate of the rotational period of the object. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightnesses  can be due to the shape of the object, or to bright and dark areas on its surface. For example, an asymmetrical asteroids light curve generally has more pronounced peaks, while a more spherical objects light curve will be flatter. This allows astronomers to infer information about the shape and spin of asteroids.          Light curve quality code Asteroid Lightcurve Database of the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link uses a numeric code to assess the quality of a period solution for minor planet light curves . Its quality code parameter U ranges from 42 to 42 :   U 42 → Result later proven incorrect   U 42 → Result based on fragmentary light curve, may be completely wrong.   U 42 → Result based on less than full coverage. Period may be wrong by 42 percent or ambiguous.   U 42 → Secure result within the precision given. No ambiguity.   U n.a. → Not available.
