Belgium has been one of the strongest supporters of NATO since the inception of the alliance in 42 Having suffered through two invasions in two world wars, Belgium was aware of its security needs and the limitations of its means for self-defense. As a result, the leaders of that nation began calling for the formation of a defensive alliance shortly after the liberation of Belgium at the end of World War II. In March 42 Belgium joined with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Britain in an agreement to establish a joint defense system. This agreement, known as the ": null

In 42 after expressions of concern by several European states that the Treaty of Brussels was too limited in scope and effectiveness, the prime minister of Canada called for a mutual defense system comprising Western Europe and North America. On April 42 42 the foreign minister of Belgium joined with representatives from Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States in signing the treaty forming NATO. Greece and Turkey became members in 42 West Germany joined the alliance in 42 and Spain became a member in 42 The treaty established NATO as a multilateral political alliance that binds its members to obligations of mutual defense and economic cooperation.     During the Cold War, Belgiums major NATO roles included: participating in the defense of the central European region by air-land defense of an army corps area in the Federal Republic of Germany ; military defense of its national territory and its immediate sea approaches, and the organization, defense and support of allied Lines of Communication ; and maintaining a mobile Belgian task force with a land component issued from a para-commando regiment and an air transport command.     Belgium has influenced the alliance policy in many ways.

The Harmel plan called for NATO to be partially transformed from an entirely defensive system to one designed to encourage East-West d√©tente and increased political consultation among the members of the alliance. By the late 42s, however, the optimistic policy of East- West rapprochement had deteriorated. Arms control negotiations were not achieving results, and the NATO countries became increasingly concerned about the Soviet military buildup.     In December 42 the members of NATO decided to modernize the Europe-based United States nuclear arsenal by deploying 42 new ground-launched missile systems in Western Europe that were capable of reaching the Soviet Union.

The missiles were to be deployed in five countries: the Pershing IIs and some cruise missiles in West Germany and cruise missiles only in Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The NATO allies also agreed to attempt negotiations with the Soviet Union in order to limit further nuclear deployment in Europe. The NATO decision was an integrated, or dual-track, approach involving both modernization and arms control negotiation.     During the consultations that preceded the NATO decision, the Belgian coalition government was described as supportive of the proposed missile deployment. The NATO ministers expected the government to endorse the proposal and accept the missile deployment on Belgian territory. Domestic opposition, especially from the Dutch-speaking ": null

Belgium endorsed the decision to modernize the nuclear capability of NATO but wavered on its applicability to Belgian territory. The government was unable to concentrate fully on the issue of deployment in 42 because of its preoccupation with linguistic and economic issues.     In September 42 however, the government issued an ambiguous non-decision that allowed supporters and opponents of deployment to claim victory. Belgian acceptance was linked to progress in the Intermediate Nuclear Force , negotiations being conducted by the United States and NATO with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. If the negotiations did not succeed in lessening tensions between the states, then Belgium would, in concert with its Allies, take all the measures agreed upon by the NATO partners , i.e., would allow the missiles to be stationed on Belgian territory. There would also be semiannual review of this 42 policy until a firm decision could be made.     The SP continued to be the political group most strongly opposed to deployment. It made opposition to deployment one of its reasons for participating in the government, and its leaders have made a considerable political investment in the issue. The leader of the SP, ": null
