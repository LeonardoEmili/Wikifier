In 1925–27, it appeared in a second edition with an important Introduction to the Second Edition, an Appendix A that replaced ✸9 and all-new Appendix B and Appendix C. PM is not to be confused with Russells 1903  The Principles of Mathematics . PM was originally conceived as a sequel volume to Russells 1903 Principles, but as PM states, this became an unworkable suggestion for practical and philosophical reasons: The present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a second volume of Principles of Mathematics... But as we advanced, it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left obscure and doubtful in the former work, we have now arrived at what we believe to be satisfactory solutions.

        ", the logicistic theory of PM has no precise statement of the syntax of the formalism . Another observation is that almost immediately in the theory, interpretations  are presented in terms of truth-values for the behaviour of the symbols ⊢ , ~ , and V .     Truth-values: PM embeds the notions of truth and falsity in the notion primitive proposition . A raw formalist theory would not provide the meaning of the symbols that form a primitive proposition —the symbols themselves could be absolutely arbitrary and unfamiliar. The theory would specify only how the symbols behave based on the grammar of the theory. Then later, by assignment of values , a model would specify an interpretation of what the formulas are saying. Thus in the formal Kleene symbol set below, the interpretation of what the symbols commonly mean, and by implication how they end up being used, is given in parentheses, e.g., ¬ . But this is not a pure Formalist theory.            The following formalist theory is offered as contrast to the logicistic theory of PM. A contemporary formal system would be constructed as follows:   Symbols used: This set is the starting set, and other symbols can appear but only by definition from these beginning symbols. A starting set might be the following set derived from Kleene 1952: logical symbols: → , & , V , ¬ , ∀ , ∃ ; predicate symbol ; function symbols + , ∙ , ; individual symbol 0 ; variables a , b , c , etc.; and parentheses . This set is taken from Kleene 1952:69 substituting → for ⊃.   Symbol strings: The theory will build strings of these symbols by ": null

Rule of inference, detachment, modus ponens : The rule that allows the theory to detach a conclusion from the premises that led up to it, and thereafter to discard the premises .

Indeed, after the application of modus ponens, nothing is left but the conclusion, the rest disappears forever.   : Contemporary theories often specify as their first axiom the classical or ": null

        " or the rule of detachment :   :: A, A ⊃ B │ B    : The symbol │ is usually written as a horizontal line, here ⊃ means implies . The symbols A and B are stand-ins for strings; this form of notation is called an axiom schema . This can be read in a manner similar to IF-THEN but with a difference: given symbol string IF A and A implies B THEN B . But the symbols have no interpretation and modus ponens proceeds mechanistically, by grammar alone.         The theory of PM has both significant similarities, and similar differences, to a contemporary formal theory. Kleene states that this deduction of mathematics from logic was offered as intuitive axiomatics. The axioms were intended to be believed, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world . Quote from Kleene 1952:45. See discussion LOGICISM at pages 43–46. Indeed, unlike a Formalist theory that manipulates symbols according to rules of grammar, PM introduces the notion of truth-values , i.e., truth and falsity in the real-world sense, and the assertion of truth almost immediately as the fifth and sixth elements in the structure of the theory :   Variables   Uses of various letters   The fundamental functions of propositions: the Contradictory Function symbolised by ~ and the Logical Sum or Disjunctive Function symbolised by ∨ being taken as primitive and logical implication defined  as p ⊃ q .. ~ p ∨ q Df.  and logical product defined as p . q .. ~ Df.    Equivalence: Logical equivalence, not arithmetic equivalence: ≡ given as a demonstration of how the symbols are used, i.e., Thus p ≡ q stands for  . . . Notice that to discuss a notation PM identifies a meta -notation with ... : In his section 8.5.4 Groping towards metalogic Grattan-Guinness 2000:454ff discusses the American logicians critical reception of the second edition of PM. For instance Sheffer puzzled that In order to give an account of logic, we must presuppose and employ logic . And Bernstein ended his 1926 review with the comment that This distinction between the propositional logic as a mathematical system and as a language must be made, if serious errors are to be avoided; this distinction the Principia does not make . Logical equivalence appears again as a definition: p ≡ q ..  .  , Notice the appearance of parentheses. This grammatical usage is not specified and appears sporadically; parentheses do play an important role in symbol strings, however, e.g., the notation  for the contemporary ∀x .   Truth-values: The Truth-value of a proposition is truth if it is true, and falsehood if it is false .   Assertion-sign: ⊦. p may be read it is true that ... thus ⊦: p .⊃. q means it is true that p implies q , whereas ⊦. p .⊃⊦. q means p is true; therefore q is true. The first of these does not necessarily involve the truth either of p or of q, while the second involves the truth of both .   Inference: PM s version of modus ponens. ⊦. p and ⊦ have occurred, then ⊦ . q will occur if it is desired to put it on record. The process of the inference cannot be reduced to symbols. Its sole record is the occurrence of ⊦. q .   The use of dots   Definitions: These use the sign with Df at the right end.   Summary of preceding statements: brief discussion of the primitive ideas ~ p and p ∨ q and ⊦ prefixed to a proposition.   Primitive propositions: the axioms or postulates. This was significantly modified in the second edition.   Propositional functions: The notion of proposition was significantly modified in the second edition, including the introduction of atomic propositions linked by logical signs to form molecular propositions, and the use of substitution of molecular propositions into atomic or molecular propositions to create new expressions.   The range of values and total variation   Ambiguous assertion and the real variable: This and the next two sections were modified or abandoned in the second edition. In particular, the distinction between the concepts defined in sections 15.

Pp     Together with the Introduction to the Second Edition , the second editions Appendix A abandons the entire section ✸9. This includes six primitive propositions ✸9 through ✸9.15 together with the Axioms of reducibility.     The revised theory is made difficult by the introduction of the Sheffer stroke to symbolise incompatibility , the contemporary logical NAND . In the revised theory, the Introduction presents the notion of atomic proposition , a datum that belongs to the philosophical part of logic . These have no parts that are propositions and do not contain the notions all or some . For example: this is red , or this is earlier than that . Such things can exist ad finitum, i.e., even an infinite enumeration of them to replace generality . This idea is due to Wittgensteins Tractatus.

Perhaps the above can be made clearer by the discussion of classes in Introduction to the Second Edition, which disposes of the Axiom of Reducibility and replaces it with the notion: All functions of functions are extensional , i.e.,   : φx ≡ x ψx .⊃. : ƒ ≡ ƒ     This has the reasonable meaning that IF for all values of x the truth-values of the functions φ and ψ of x are equivalent, THEN the function ƒ of a given φẑ and ƒ of ψẑ are equivalent. PM asserts this is obvious :   : This is obvious, since φ can only occur in ƒ by the substitution of values of φ for p, q, r, ... in a function, and, if φx ≡ ψx, the substitution of φx for p in a function gives the same truth-value to the truth-function as the substitution of ψx. Consequently there is no longer any reason to distinguish between functions classes, for we have, in virtue of the above,   : φx ≡ x ψx .⊃. . φẑ . ψẑ .   Observe the change to the equality sign on the right. PM goes on to state that will continue to hang onto the notation ẑ , but this is merely equivalent to φẑ, and this is a class. .         According to Carnap s Logicist Foundations of Mathematics , Russell wanted a theory that could plausibly be said to derive all of mathematics from purely logical axioms. However, Principia Mathematica required, in addition to the basic axioms of type theory, three further axioms that seemed to not be true as mere matters of logic, namely the axiom of infinity , the axiom of choice , and the axiom of reducibility . Since the first two were existential axioms, Russell phrased mathematical statements depending on them as conditionals. But reducibility was required to be sure that the formal statements even properly express statements of real analysis, so that statements depending on it could not be reformulated as conditionals. Frank P. Ramsey tried to argue that Russells ramification of the theory of types was unnecessary, so that reducibility could be removed, but these arguments seemed inconclusive.     Beyond the status of the axioms as logical truth s, one can ask the following questions about any system such as PM:   whether a contradiction could be derived from the axioms , and   whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system .     Propositional logic itself was known to be consistent, but the same had not been established for Principia": null
