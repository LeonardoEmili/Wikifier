But when Manion sees Caswells rope burns around his neck, and hears his admission that in his life he had murdered over 42 men, he knows he must try to send Caswell back.     The discussion leads to an argument. Caswell attacks Manion, killing him with a desk lamp. He then flees from the laboratory into a busy street, but is overwhelmed by the lights and the noise; he returns to the lab, distraught and desperate. He breaks down, pleading for the dead scientist to help him.     A thief named Paul Johnson enters the lab. Caswell fights with Johnson, but Johnson gets the upper hand and strangles Caswell with the cord from the window curtains. As Johnson tries to find Manions safe, he accidentally activates the time machine and is sent back to 42 appearing in the noose intended for Caswell, just in time to be hanged. The witnesses to the hanging are shocked to see a strangers body, in strange clothes, in place of Caswell. They question whether this was the Devils work or some other powers, and whether they have just executed an innocent man.        Trivia from The Twilight Zone. Albany, GA: Bear Manor Media.
