Unlike at Auschwitz, where the cyanide-based Zyklon-B was used to exterminate trainloads of prisoners under the guise of relocation , the camps at Treblinka , Bełżec , and Sobibór , built during Operation Reinhard , used lethal exhaust fumes produced by large internal combustion engine s. The three killing centres of Einsatz Reinhard were constructed predominantly for the extermination of Polands Jews trapped in the Nazi ghettos . At first, the victims bodies were buried with the use of crawler excavator s, but they were later exhumed and incinerated in open-air pyres to hide the evidence of genocide in what became known as Sonderaktion 1005 .     Whereas the Auschwitz II and Majdanek camps were parts of a labor camp complex, the Chełmno and Operation Reinhard death camps were built exclusively for the rapid extermination of entire communities of people within hours of their arrival. All were constructed near branch line s that linked to the Polish railway system, with staff members transferring between locations. These camps had almost identical design: they were several hundred metres in length and width, and were equipped with only minimal staff housing and support installations not meant for the unlucky hordes crammed into the railway transports .
