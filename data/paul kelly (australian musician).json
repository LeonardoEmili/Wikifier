Kelly described his songwriting as a scavenging art, a desperate act. For me its a bit from here, a bit from there, fumbling around, never quite knowing what youre doing ... Song writing is like a way of feeling connected to mystery. He has resisted the label of storyteller and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times its just that situation . Sometimes the same character is found in different songs, such as in To Her Door , Love Never Runs on Time , and How to Make Gravy .     Kelly has also provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. Women at the Well had 42 female artists record his songs in tribute.
