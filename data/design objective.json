Examples of reasons for designating a performance characteristic as a DO rather than as a standard are it may be bordering on an advancement in the state of the art, the requirement may not have been fully confirmed by measurement or experience with operating circuits, and it may not have been demonstrated that the requirement can be met considering other constraints, such as cost and size.     A DO is sometimes established in a standard for developmental consideration. A DO may also specify a performance characteristic used in the preparation of specifications for development or ": null
