By 1976s  A New World Record , Lynne had almost developed the roots of the group into a more complex and unique pop-rock sound mixed with studio strings, layered vocals, and tight, catchy pop singles.

The pinnacle of ELOs chart success and worldwide popularity was the expansive 1977 double album  Out of the Blue , which was largely conceived in a Swiss chalet during a two-week writing marathon.  The bands 1978 world tour featured an elaborate space ship set and laser light show. In order to recreate the complex instrumental textures of their albums, the band used pre-recorded supplemental backing tracks in live performances. Although that practice has now become commonplace, it caused considerable derision in the press of the time.  Lynne has often stated that he prefers the creative environment of the studio to the rigours and tedium of touring. In 1979, Lynne followed up the success of Out of the Blue with  Discovery , which held No. 1 in the UK for 5 weeks. The album is primarily associated with its two disco-flavoured singles  and with the titles word play on disco and very .  However, the remaining seven non-disco tracks on the album reflected Lynnes range as a pop-rock songwriter, including a heavy, mid-tempo rock anthem  that, despite its use of a drum loop, could be considered the antithesis of disco. Lynne later recalled his forays into dance music: I love the force of disco. I love the freedom it gave me to make different rhythms across it. I enjoyed that really steady driving beat. Just steady as a rock. I’ve always liked that simplicity in the bass drum.     In 1979, Lynne rejected an offer for ELO to headline the ": null

Nevertheless, Lynne was not closely involved with the development of the film, and his material consequently had only superficial attachment to the plot. Xanadu performed weakly at the box office . Lynne subsequently disavowed his limited contribution to the project.           In 1981, Lynne took the band in a somewhat different direction with the science-fiction themed album  Time , reaching number one for two weeks in the UK, producing the second Top 3 single in less than two years. The strings were still featured, but with heavily synthesised textures. Following a marginally successful tour, Lynne kept this general approach with 1983s  Secret Messages  and a final contractually-obligated ELO album  Balance of Power  in 1986. Lynne discusses the contractually-obligated nature of the final albums on the short interview included with the Zoom DVD.
