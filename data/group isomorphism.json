When the relevant group operations are unambiguous they are omitted and one writes:   : G \\cong H     Sometimes one can even simply write G H . Whether such a notation is possible without confusion or ambiguity depends on context. For example, the equals sign is not very suitable when the groups are both subgroups of the same group.

Intuitively, group theorists view two isomorphic groups as follows: For every element g of a group G, there exists an element h of H such that h behaves in the same way as g . For instance, if g generates G, then so does h. This implies in particular that G and H are in bijective correspondence. Thus, the definition of an isomorphism is quite natural.

For example, for , multiplying all elements of Z 7 by 3, modulo 7, is an automorphism of order 6 in the automorphism group, because , while lower powers do not give 1. Thus this automorphism generates Z 6 . There is one more automorphism with this property: multiplying all elements of Z 7 by 5, modulo 7. Therefore, these two correspond to the elements 1 and 5 of Z 6 , in that order or conversely.     The automorphism group of Z 6 is isomorphic to Z 2 , because only each of the two elements 1 and 5 generate Z 6 , so apart from the identity we can only interchange these.     The automorphism group of  has order 168, as can be found as follows. All 7 non-identity elements play the same role, so we can choose which plays the role of .
