Factions in the game include the following:     The Union: The North American Union is the combination of all North American nations; they possess advanced technology and superior tactics.   Neo-Soviets: Resurgent communist Russian forces, with crude but powerful weapons and mutated animals. The Neo-Soviet Empire cares for the nation as a whole and not any one citizen. It employs chemical and radiation weapons at will. The human wave tactic is the most common strategy used.   Growlers: The Growlers are primate-like monsters directed by the packs collective packmind, strong and adaptable, and the main enemies of the Zykhee. The four main breeds are:     :Razorbacks - The razorback breed inhabits areas of high metallic ore concentrations. Their spines and teeth are now made of metal.     :Bluefangs - The bluefangs inhabit any lush jungle or forest they can find. As ambush hunters they will sit and wait for prey, but tend to graze their area as well, making them bloated by the sheer volume of food taken in.     :Fireguts - These growlers have actually used heat to release the energy of their food rather than chemical reactions. They inhabit areas of volcanic activity and have the ability to spit lava.     :Whitetusks - The most intelligent of growlers, the Whitetusks are the best coordinated of all the breeds. Identified by their white fur and large tusks coming from their heads they make up the smallest of the growler breeds.     Zykhee: Vaguely humanoid aliens with advanced technology, powerful melee weapons and spiritual abilities.   Shard: The Shard are a race of lifeforms who have transcended physical form and have become pure energy. Upon entering the Maelstrom they found the need to encase said energy/essence in crystalline forms. Vaguely humanoid in shape, the Shard have an extreme hatred for carbons , and stop at nothing to wipe them out.   Pharon: The Pharon are a dead race.

They specialize in vehicles and are constantly on the move.
