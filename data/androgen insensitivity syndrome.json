A distinct name has been given to many of the various presentations of AIS, such as Reifenstein syndrome , Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome , Morris syndrome , Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome , Lubs syndrome , incomplete testicular feminization , Rosewater syndrome , and Aimans syndrome . Since it was not understood that these different presentations were all caused by the same set of mutations in the androgen receptor gene, a unique name was given to each new combination of symptoms, resulting in a complicated stratification of seemingly disparate disorders.     Over the last 42 years, as reports of strikingly different phenotypes were reported to occur even among members of the same family, and as steady progress was made towards the understanding of the underlying molecular ": null

        " of AIS, these disorders were found to be different phenotypic expressions of one syndrome caused by molecular defects in the androgen receptor gene.     AIS is now the accepted terminology for the syndromes resulting from unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones. CAIS encompasses the phenotypes previously described by testicular feminization , Morris syndrome, and Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome; PAIS includes Reifenstein syndrome, Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome, Lubs syndrome, incomplete testicular feminization , and Rosewater syndrome; and MAIS includes Aimans syndrome.     The more virilized phenotypes of AIS have sometimes been described as undervirilized male syndrome , infertile male syndrome , undervirilized fertile male syndrome , etc., before evidence was reported that these conditions were caused by mutations in the AR gene. These diagnoses were used to describe a variety of mild defects in virilization; as a result, the phenotypes of some men who have been diagnosed as such are better described by PAIS , while others are better described by MAIS .
