The T42 head had a tendency to overheat, and McCartneys was no exception, so he was then provided with an AC42 head which powered the T42s separate speaker cabinet.     As the crowds at Beatles shows got louder, they needed louder amps. Jennings provided Lennon and Harrison with the first AC42 piggyback units, and McCartneys AC42/T42 rig was replaced with an AC42 head and an AC42 42×42 cabinet. Lennon and Harrison eventually got their own AC42 rigs, with 42×42 /42-horn configurations. In 42 and 42 The Beatles had several prototype or specially-built Vox amplifiers, including hybrid tube/solid-state units from the short-lived 42- and 42-series. Harrison in particular became fond of the 42 amp and 42×42 cabinet, using them to create many the guitar sounds found on  Revolver  and  Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band . Lennon favoured the larger 42 amplifier, while Harrison preferred the 42 and McCartney had its sister 42 bass amplifier.

Vox produced a number of other models of 42 and 42 string electric guitars in both England and Italy.         Guitar pedals and other effects, including an early version of the wah-wah pedal used by Jimi Hendrix and the Tone Bender fuzzbox pedal, a Vox variation on the famous original Gary Hurst Tone Bender , were also marketed by Vox and later on manufactured in Italy.     thu battery, direct plug-in or by in-line cable     In 42 Vox introduced a series of guitars which featured built in effects such as Distortion , Repeat Percussion , Treble/Bass Booster and a wah-wah operated by the heel of the picking hand pushing on a spring-loaded lever over the bridge. The Delta phantom style guitar and bass, the Starstream teardrop 42-string, and Constellation teardrop bass had such effects.     Vox also pioneered the first radio microphone system, which freed singers from having their microphone connected to their amplifier or PA by a cable.         Vox had experimented with Japanese manufacturers at the end of the sixties with the Les Paul -style VG42, and in 42 all guitar production was moved to Japan, where the Standard & Custom 42 & 42 guitars and basses were built by Matsumoku , the makers of Aria guitars . These were generally regarded as the best quality guitars ever built under the Vox name. They were discontinued in 42 when production was moved to Korea and they were replaced by the White Shadow models. A number of White Shadow M -series guitars and basses are clearly marked as made in Japan , suggesting a phased production hand-over.     In 42 Vox Amplification Ltd Korg reissued many of their classic Phantom and Teardrop guitars.     In March 42 Vox unveiled the semi-hollow Virage DC and SC at the NAMM show . Notable characteristics include a 42D contoured ergonomic design which not only had an arch top, but also bent back from the neck toward the base of the guitar hugging the players body. The guitar body was milled from a single block of wood and had a fitted face in combinations of mahogany and ash . A new triple coil pick-up system designed by DiMarzio , called the Three42, emulates a humbucker , P42 , or single-coil tone.     In 42 Vox refined the Virage design with the Virage II series of guitars. This series repeated the double and single cutaway bodies of the earlier Virage series, but also included the Series 42 , the Series 42 , and the Series 42 . The Virage II series featured CoAxe pick-ups which resembled the earlier Three42 in functionality, but were claimed to be less noisy. The one-piece cast MaxConnect bridge of this series is aluminium and provides both a saddle and anchor for the strings.     For 42 the VOX Phantom and Teardrop guitars appeared again as the APACHE Series travel guitars with a host of built in features including a 42-channel guitar amplifier, speakers, dozens of rhythm patterns, even a convenient E-String tuner.

In 42 the   Vox Continental was given to The Echoes to trial on stage and use on records they cut with Bert Weedon and Dusty Springfield as well being featured on their version of Sticks & Stones 42 as well many other records, and later used by Paul Revere of Paul Revere & the Raiders , as well as Ray Manzarek on most songs recorded by The Doors and by John Lennon on The Beatles track Im Down , both in the studio and live at their 42 Shea Stadium concert. Doug Ingle of Iron Butterfly used it on In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and other songs of the group. Mike Smith of The Dave Clark Five and Rod Argent of The Zombies also made frequent use of the instrument. Peter Tork of the Monkees can be seen playing the unusual looking Vox organs several times during the Monkees TV series . In newer popular music, the organist Spider Webb of the UK garage band The Horrors can be seen using a Vox Continental. A famous Vox organ riff can be heard on 42 Tears by Question Mark & the Mysterians . Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers has frequently used his vintage 42 single Continental in the studio with the band since 42 and still uses the instrument today. Another famous signature Vox organ sound was created by Augie Meyers when playing with the Sir Douglas Quintet, as heard in the songs Mendocino and Shes About a Mover.       The Continental and other Vox organs such as the Jaguar, the Continental II, Super Continental, and the Continental 42 share characteristic visual features including orange and black vinyl coverings, stands made of chromed steel tubing, and reversed black and white keys. The English wood key single manual Continental is increasingly collectable, although the wood key American-built and plastic key Italian-built models also command premium prices. Jennings sold production rights for the Vox Continental organ to an Italian subsidiary of Thomas Organ in 42 Under the new production agreement, the Continental was gradually and subtly altered in quality and sound, and reliability became questionable. For example, Ray Manzarek of The Doors had been using a Vox since 42 but could no longer trust it during performances because of the problems in quality after 42 and thus was forced to look elsewhere for an organ. He settled on the Gibson Kalamazoo , because it had a flat top like the Vox Continental, so it could accommodate the physical requirements of the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, which was the bass instrument for The Doors in concert.       thu   thu   In 42 Vox introduced the problematic V42 GuitarOrgan , a Phantom VI guitar with internal organ electronics. John Lennon was given one in a bid to secure an endorsement, although this never happened. According to Up-Tight: the ": null

        " Story, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also tried one; when asked by the Velvets if it worked , his answer was negative.     The V42 connects to a mains power-supply unit via DIN plugs and a four-conductor cable . The PSU in turn has individual amplifier outputs for guitar and organ.     Organ tones are sounded in one of three ways; in normal mode, by pressing any string onto a fret; in percussion mode, by fretting any string and touching the included brass plectrum onto any metal part of the guitar; or by pressing one of the six open string buttons. There is an option to silence the lowest two strings, and the organ section, as a whole, can also be switched off. There is a four-position octave selector, a six-position effect selector, a four-way selector for the percussion and a flute selector.     The guitar section is equipped with two Vox pick-ups, a three-way selector, and conventional volume and tone controls. In common with Phantom models, it has a Bigsby-style tremolo unit, a fixed-intonation bridge and individual Vox-branded tuners.     The V42 is somewhat awkward to play as the neck is wider at the nut end than at the body, and a players natural tendency to bend a string results in it slipping off the divided fret. Additionally it is very heavy, weighing, nearly 42  lbs.     The instrument never became popular though it was a precursor to the modern guitar synthesizer. Ian Curtis of Joy Division is sometimes believed to have used a GuitarOrgan, but he actually owned two white Phantom VI special with onboard effects. Hempsall, Alan. Extro, Vol.42/No.42 42       Vox quickly grew. In 42 Tom Jennings, to raise capital for JMIs expansion, sold controlling interest in JMI to the Royston Group, a British holding company, and sold American rights to the California-based Thomas Organ Company . Displeased with the direction his old company was taking, he left the company in 42 which was around the same time that Marshall overtook Vox as the dominant force in the British guitar amplifier market. While Roystons Vox Sound Equipment division set up new operations in the Kent town of Erith, Tom Jennings set up a new company in his old Dartford location, joined later by Dick Denney. Jennings Electronic Industries operated for several years, making an updated and rebadged version of the AC42 along with other amplifiers, as well as a new range of organs.     Meanwhile, Royston, due to the loss of a lucrative government contract in one of its other companies, went into liquidation in 42 As a result, Vox went through a series of owners including a British bank and Dallas-Arbiter. The AC42 continued to be built alongside newer solid-state amps, but in a series of cost-cutting moves different loudspeakers with ceramic magnets began to be used, as were printed circuit boards and solid-state rectification. Particleboard replaced some plywood parts in cabinet construction, and at one point an all-solid-state version was introduced alongside the classic tube-powered model. Rose-Morris, Marshall Amplifications British distributor, bought Vox in the 42s when their deal with Marshall ended. They tried to reinvigorate the Vox brand, continuing to build the AC42 along with a few other decent modern designs. In 42 they sold the company to Korg.     Meanwhile, in Sepulveda, Thomas Organ, after importing JMIs British-made amps for a short period in 42–42 began to produce a line of mostly solid-state amplifiers in the United States that carried the Vox name and cosmetic stylings. With some assistance from Dick Denney, these amps effectively paralleled JMIs own transistorised amplifiers but were different from the British and Italian made Voxes in sound and reliability. To promote their equipment, Thomas Organ built the Voxmobile , a Ford roadster dressed up to look like a Phantom guitar, complete with a Continental organ and several Beatle amplifiers. Despite the huge marketing effort, Thomas Organs Vox products did much to damage the reputation of Vox in the North American market for many years. By 42 the company had also marketed a line of Vox drum sets , which included a kit that featured a conical-shaped bass drum, that looked more like a wastepaper basket left on its side, and another with a bass drum, that looked like a flat tire. Such gimmicks did not help sales, and by the early 42s Voxs American presence was virtually nonexistent.     thu       The AC42 was one of the first amplifiers to bear the VOX name and has long been adored for its ability to achieve rich, articulate tube tone at very manageable volumes. For this reason, the AC42 has become a highly coveted piece of VOX history since its discontinuation in 42 It was re-introduced in 42 as model AC42C42 and has proven to be very popular as a quality option to the Fender Blues Jr. and Fender Princeton.       Vox Amplification Ltd. has been owned by Korg since 42 Korg revived the tube rectifier and alnico speaker s for their version of the AC42 in what is considered the most faithful version of the amp produced for many years. Korg have also used the Vox name for a new range of digital modelling amps. In 42 manufacturing was moved to Vietnam, including a yet-newer redesign of the venerable AC42 designated the AC42CC, which has now been superseded by the AC42C42 A hand-wired, heritage version, the AC42H42 were also produced. The AC42CC and AC42CC were later replaced with the AC42C42 and AC42C42 which had solid state rectification and a revised chassis. In 42 Vox released a Hand-Wired version of the AC42 and AC42 with turret board construction, valve rectification and a choice of Celestion Greenback or Alnico Blue speakers. In 42 a Hand Wired version of the AC42 was also released. Less expensive consumer versions of the retro AC42 have been marketed in recent years as well: various sizes of AC42TV.       Vox entered the lunchbox amp market in 42 when it introduced the Night Train head. This compact, all valve amp is a 42W head with two 42AX42 preamp tubes, a pair of push-pull EL42 valves in its power section, and a solid state rectifier. It uses a cathodyne splitter, and its power section is cathode biased. The amp is solidly constructed on a black steel chassis with a bright mirror chrome finish, diamond-perforated steel tube cage, giving it a physical appearance reminiscent of a lunchbox . The NT42H also set the cosmetic and operational template for two additional releases, also all valve heads, that book-ended its output power: the 42W Lil Night Train in 42 which uses two 42AX42 preamp tubes and a 42AU42 dual triode as its power section, and the 42W Night Train 42 in 42 a two channel head with four 42AX42 preamp tubes and a pair of EL42 valves in its power section. All models feature the ability to choose between the familiar chimey Vox voice and a high gain voice that bypasses the EQ section, via the Bright/Thick switch. Note though that each Night Train models feature set also provides some unique capability apart from its siblings. For example, the NT42H output power can be switched between 42W pentode and 42W triode modes. The NT42H provides a headphone/line out jack with on-board speaker emulation . Lastly, the NT42H offers two channels by adding a second,optionally foot-switchable, higher gain Girth channel, a Tone Cut control and a Tight switch in its master section, plus a bypassable, JFET-driven effects loop. All models were designed for use with most any 42 ohm or 42 ohm cabinet, although Vox also offers a matching cabinet for each model.     In 42 Vox released updated G42 versions of the 42 watt and 42 watt heads, and added a combo version of the NT42H-G42 called the NT42C42 Compared to the original NT42H, the NT42H-G42 adds a foot-switchable Girth channel with an additional 42AX42 in the preamp section, a Dark switch, a digital reverb, and an effects loop. However, Vox did not retain the pentode/triode output section modes from the G42 version that allowed for full or half power operation as well as a broader tonal palette. The NT42H-G42 differs from the original NT42H with the additions of an XLR D.I. out and a digital reverb, and the deletions of one 42AX42 preamp tube and the Tight switch. It also appears the FX loop is no longer bypassable. Gone is the bright chrome look of the G42 models as both heads received new cosmetics in the form of a black mirror finish on the tube cage and a new suitcase-type handle. Vox also released G42 versions of their matching cabs: the V42NT-G42 , and the V42NT-G42 , each also sporting the suitcase-type handle. The new NT42C42 combo combines an NT42H-G42 chassis with a single 42Ω 42” Celestion G42M Greenback speaker in a black tolex cabinet with a suitcase-type handle.     In August 42 Vox released two Night Train limited editions, both of which were cosmetic updates to the NT42H set and the NT42C42 combo respectively, that recall a more traditional Vox aesthetic. For the Lil Night Train NT42H-GD-SET, Vox supplied the NT42H head with a matte gold coloured tube cage and black control knobs, and then covered its V42NT cab with a retro-traditional “Brown Diamond“ grille cloth and basket weave covering . For the NT42C42-CL combo amp Vox applied a similar treatment with the installation of a gold logo badge and trim on the front of the NT42C42 combo as well as adding the “Brown Diamond“ grille cloth.     As of Fall 42 it appears the Night Train series has been completely discontinued and the Vox website no longer references any Night Train amplifiers in its online catalogue.         thu JG   thu .   Vox, at least initially, emerged as a leader in the digital amp modelling market with the release of its Valvetronix line of digital amplifier modellers. Utilising Korgs REMS modelling software, the Valvetronix are driven via a low-power tube preamp stage and a solid state power amp. The latest line, the AD42VT / AD42VT / AD42VT / AD42VT, has received awards and praise for its recreation of eleven classic guitar amplifiers. The company did not reveal which non-Vox amplifiers were modelled in the product manual. The eleven amplifier types as named on the dial are:     Boutique CL   Black 42×42   Tweed 42×42   AC42   AC42TB   UK 42s   UK 42s   UK Modern   US NuMetal   US HiGain   US TweakGain   Boutique O.D       As for the newer versions, which feature 42 models based upon, in order from green to red mode:     Boutique CL / Modded CL: Dumble Overdrive /Fender Showman   Deluxe Tweed / Tweed 42X42: Fender Tweed Deluxe/Fender 42 Twin Amp   Super 42X42 / Tweed 42X42: Fender Super Reverb/Fender Tweed Bassman   AC42 TB / AC42: Vox AC42 /VOX AC42   AC42HH / AC42TB: Vox AC42HH / VOX AC42 Top Boost   Express Train / Boutique OD: Trainwreck Express/Dumble Overdrive   AC42CP42 / AC42BM: Vox AC42CP42/Vox AC42BM Brian May   UK 42TH / UK 42S: Marshall 42 Slash Jubilee / Marshall JCM42   US 42S / Cali Metal: Peavey 42 / Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier   UK Modern / UK 42S: Marshall JVM / Marshall JCM42   Boutique Metal / Metal Bull: Diezel VH42 / VHT Pittbull         The valvetronix XL-series builds on the success of the original valvetronix digital amplifier. A range of tube-powered modelling amplifiers, with hi-gain sounds designed to span the entire range of heavy rock music. The XL-series uses VOXs patented Valve Reactor technology, producing the sound and feel of an all-tube amp.   Models: AD42VT-XL 42-watt 42×42 speaker, AD42VT-XL 42-watt 42×42 speaker, AD42VT-XL 42-watt 42×42 speakers, AD42VT-XL 42-watt 42×42 speakers.     Each amplifier has eleven inbuilt amp sounds:   Glass / Funked / Buzzsaw / Crunched / Thrashed / Raged / Modern / Fluid / Molten / Black / Damaged     Hi-quality modern effects are also built in, giving more control over the output:   Octave / Comp / Comp + Phaser / Comp + Chorus / Chorus + Delay / Chorus + Reverb / Flanger + Reverb / Tremolo + Reverb / Rotary + Reverb / Delay / Reverb       thu   In addition to the Valvetronix, Vox has developed a line of analogue effects pedals . Dubbed Cooltron, the line provides guitarists with vintage sounding overdrive , compression , boost, distortion and tremolo . The pedals use low-power 42AU42 tubes to create vintage soft-clipping preamplification. Two of the Cooltron pedals, the Big Ben Overdrive and the Bulldog Distortion, won the Guitar World magazine Platinum Award. Guitar World": null
