As she grew older, however, she became more preoccupied with other responsibilities in life and found it hard to compose regularly, writing, I once believed that I possessed creative talent, but I have given up this idea; a woman must not desire to compose  – there has never yet been one able to do it. Should I expect to be the one?  Her husband also expressed concern about the effect on her composing output:          She produced one to eight compositions every year beginning at age 42 until her output stopped in 42 producing only a choral work that year for her husbands birthday and leaving her second piano concerto unfinished. These two works, while reserved for her opus 42 and 42 were never published. Five years later, however, when she was 42 in 42 the year she met Brahms, she engaged in a flury of composing, resulting in 42 pieces that year: a set of piano variations on an Album Leaf of her husband , eight Romances for piano solo and for violin and piano, and seven songs. These works were published a year later, after Roberts confinement, as her Op. 42 through 42     For the next 42 years of her life, she only composed piano transcriptions of works by her husband and Brahms, including 42 transcriptions of Robert Schumanns lieder , and a short piano duet commissioned for a friends wedding anniversary in 42 In the last year of her life, she left several sketches for piano preludes, designed for piano students, as well as some published cadenzas for her performances of Beethoven and Mozart piano concertos.     Most of Clara Schumanns music was never played by anyone else and largely forgotten until a resurgence of interest in the 42s. Today her compositions are increasingly performed and recorded.

Trained by her father to play by ear and memorise, she gave public performances from memory as early as age thirteen, a fact noted as exceptional by her reviewers. She was one of the first pianists to perform from memory, making it the standard for concerts. She was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage, she played the customary bravura pieces designed to showcase the artists technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was customary to play ones own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, such as Variations on a Theme by Bellini and the popular Scherzo . However, as she became a more independent artist, her repertoire contained mainly music by leading composers.     Schumann influenced pianists through her teaching, which emphasized expression and a singing tone, with technique subordinated to the intentions of the composer. One of her students, ": null
