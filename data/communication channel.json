A sequence of random numbers might also be added in to simulate external interference and/or electronic noise in the receiver.

For example, in wireless communications the channel is often modelled by a random attenuation  of the transmitted signal, followed by additive noise. The attenuation term is a simplification of the underlying physical processes and captures the change in signal power over the course of the transmission. The noise in the model captures external interference and/or electronic noise in the receiver. If the attenuation term is complex it also describes the relative time a signal takes to get through the channel. The statistics of the random attenuation are decided by previous measurements or physical simulations.     Channel models may be continuous channel models in that there is no limit to how precisely their values may be defined.     Communication channels are also studied in a discrete-alphabet setting. This corresponds to abstracting a real world communication system in which the analog → digital and digital → analog blocks are out of the control of the designer.
