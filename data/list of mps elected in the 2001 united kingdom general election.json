Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group, while Sinn Féin has not taken its seats. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the Speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.      The effective government majority was slightly higher because Sinn Féin members do not take up their seats and the speaker does not vote. Speaker Michael Martin technically represented Labour in a notional majority.   __NOTOC__               See the ": null
