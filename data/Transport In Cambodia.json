Aside from the private-hire vehicles and ride-hailing service, public transport is also available but only in the capital. Phnom Penh city bus service started in 2015 with only three routes under the assistance of JICA. Baker, J. L. K., Natsuko; Lin, Sarah Xinyuan; Johnson, Erik Caldwell; Yin, Soriya; Ou, Narya;. . Urban Development in Phnom Penh. Retrieved from  Today, Phnom Penh City Bus operates 13 routes.          Two rail lines exist, both originating in Phnom Penh and totaling about 612 kilometers of 1,000 mm metre gauge single track.   The first line or the northern line, built by The French colonial government, running from Phnom Penh to Poipet on the Thai border, between 1930 and 1940, with Phnom Penh Railway Station opening in 1932.   The final connection with Thailand was completed by Royal State Railways in 1942. However, the service from Bangkok to Battambang was suspended when the French Indochinese Government resumed sovereignty over Battambang and the Sisophon area from Thailand on 17 December 1946, as Thailand was seen as a supporter of Khmer Issarak, the anti-French, Khmer nationalist political movement.   A third line is planned to connect Phnom Penh with Vietnam,  the last missing link of the planned rail corridor between Singapore and the city of Kunming, China. A new north-south line is also planned. The lines from Phnom Penh to Sisophon and from Sisophon to Poipet have been rehabilitated; starting with Poipet to Srey Sisophon in April of 2018 and Sisophon to Phnom Penh in early July  . The active part, the southern line, of the network is the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville line, with stops at Takeo and Kampot. The first line to be re-opened in Cambodia was the 118km long route from Phnom Penh to Touk Meas and the complete southern line in May of 2011  . Toll Royal Railway  had been given a 30 year concession from The Royal Government of Cambodia to operate Cambodias railway network.     ": null
