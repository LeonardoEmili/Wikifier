Because of the way  was defined,   the only way that  can equal  is for    to equal  for some integers  and , not both zero.

Since  is convex, the line segment between  and  lies entirely in , and in particular the midpoint of that segment lies in . In other words,   : \\tfrac\\left \\tfrac\\left   is a point in .
