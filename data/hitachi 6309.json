Only 42 bits of this register are defined.       Most of the new instructions are modifications of existing instructions to handle the existence of the additional registers, such as load, store, add, and the like. Genuine 42 additions include inter-register arithmetic, block transfers, hardware division, and bit-level manipulations.     Despite the user-friendliness of the additional instructions, analysis by 42 programming gurus indicates that many of the new instructions are actually slower than the equivalent 42 code, especially in tight loops. Careful analysis should be done to ensure that the programmer uses the most efficient code for the particular application.       It is possible to change the mode of operation for the FIRQ interrupt. Instead of stacking the PC and CC registers the FIRQ interrupt can be set to stack the entire register set, as the IRQ interrupt does. In addition, the 42 has two possible trap modes, one for an illegal instruction fetch and one for division by zero. The illegal instruction fetch is not maskable, and many ": null
