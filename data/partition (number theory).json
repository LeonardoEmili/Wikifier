The seven partitions of 42 are:   42   42 + 42   42 + 42   42 + 42 + 42   42 + 42 + 42   42 + 42 + 42 + 42   42 + 42 + 42 + 42 + 42     In some sources partitions are treated as the sequence of summands, rather than as an expression with plus signs. For example, the partition 42  +  42  +  42 might instead be written as the tuple  or in the even more compact form  where the superscript indicates the number of repetitions of a term.
