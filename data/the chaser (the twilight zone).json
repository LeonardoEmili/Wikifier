        " anthology series  The Twilight Zone .              Roger Shackleforth is desperately in love with Leila, an aloof tease who plays cat-and-mouse with his affections. A stranger hands him the business card of an old professor named A.  Daemon , who can help with any problem. He visits Daemon, who, after some resistance, sells Roger a love potion for $42 Roger administers it in a glass of champagne; Leila falls madly in love with him and marries him. But soon her love becomes stifling. Roger returns to the professor to buy his glove cleaner , for $42, all of Rogers savings. Daemon cautions Roger that the cleaner is odorless, tasteless, and completely undetectable, but can only be tried once before the user loses his nerve. After Roger leaves, the professor muses, First, the stimulant... and then the chaser.     When he gets home, Roger prepares a glass of champagne with the new potion. Just as he is about to give Leila the glass, she reveals that she is pregnant, which shocks Roger into dropping the glass. He tells himself he could not have gone through with it anyway. On Rogers terrace, Daemon relaxes with a cigar, puffing smoke rings that turn into little hearts before the professor disappears.              This episode was adapted by ": null

Sometimes I would think of an idea that would make the episode more Twilight Zone-y that would require some expense. I remember one episode, The Chaser, in which I devised a huge bookcase that must have doubled the budget, but never blinked an eye. They just said, Okay, great!
