Ralph Hexter, also writing in The Classical Tradition, comments on Isidores largest and massively influential work... on which he was still at work at the time of his death... his own architecture for the whole is relatively clear ... At the deepest level Isidores encyclopedia is rooted in the dream that language can capture the universe and that if we but parse it correctly, it can lead us to the proper understanding of Gods creation.
