Piet Dekker, with whom Jansz played in The Slumberlandband and The Rumbones , introduced him to Jan Hendriks and Carel Copier in the spring of 42 at the farm of Gé van de Donk, who later became their sound engineer. Recordings from this meeting exist on which they played, without any rehearsal, all the Dutch-language songs Jansz had written at that time.   Copier came up with the idea of the name after hearing the never officially recorded song Doe maar . When Jansz was asked to form the resident band of that years Festival of Fools, he added five more members to the band: singers Truus de Groot , Anouk Strijbosch, Wim van Oevelen , and clowns Mart de Corte and Jan Bogaerts.     Afterwards the 42-piece line-up was reduced to the original four: Ernst Jansz , Jan Hendriks , Carel Copier , and Piet Dekker .     Dekker turned out to be a songwriter as well. One of his songs appeared in 42 on a sampler album titled Uitholling overdwars, made up of new Dutch-language bands. The band also released their self-titled debut album on the ": null

But it wasnt enough; after a fallout between Jansz and Dekker , the band seriously considered splitting up, but not before finishing their spring tour. Joost Belinfante , an all-around freelance musician with whom Jansz used to play in CCC Inc. and The Slumberlandband, agreed to step in for the time being.

Vrienten initially refused as he felt it wasnt advantageous to his career, but later changed his mind. Vrienten would eventually contribute to three songs on Doe Maars second album Skunk: 42 jaar , Smoorverliefd , and De laatste X .     Skunk was initially supposed to come out in December 42 but Telstar postponed the albums release until March 42 as the company did not believe that Doe Maars efforts would survive amidst bigger names during the December period. Despite this, Telstar began to market the album and released samples to radio stations. Due to a miscommunication, DJs did not know that the record had not been released, and played the samples on the radio.     Listeners responded positively to 42 jaar , although the original name of the song, Sinds 42 dag of 42 , didnt stick and was difficult to remember. For this reason, Dutch radio DJ ": null

Jansz delivered songs about getting the cold shoulder , sleeping with a 42-year-old , and dumping a girl for being overexperienced . With Belinfante, he co-wrote Nachtmerrie op hol , about dreams of revisited exams.     In early 42 Doe Maar were still playing to below-capacity crowds, but that all changed after the March release of Doris Day , which became a No.42 hit. Regular television appearances and sellout gigs all over the country, mainly attended by teenagers, made Jansz and Vrienten, already in their 42s, the ultimate pop idols.

By the end of 42 Doe Maar notched up their first number 42 hit with De bom , a composition by Jansz with the underlying message whats the point of making a career or doing your homework when the bomb can drop at any moment?       In January 42 Pijnenburg finally rejoined the band for their best-remembered line-up . After a warm-up tour, they taped a TV special predominantly miming tracks off their yet-to-be-released fourth album , including their latest single Pa , about a father/son dispute with the former mellowed out and the latter still carrying on regardless. This single also hit the top spot. The B side, Nachtzuster was included in the TV special.     By this time, the boys stopped enjoying their success, and shortly after the release of Virus in March, Doe Maar temporarily retreated from interviews and radio/television appearances.     This decision backfired, as Doe Maar mania grew even bigger.       In September 42 Doe Maar embarked on their first proper tour of Belgium with a surprise performance at Flaterpop thrown in for good measure. Jansz released his debut novel Gideons droom which was based on an East-West theme. Vrienten recorded his first Dutch-language solo album  with help from his friends.
