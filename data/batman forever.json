Originally darker than the final product, the movies original length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes, according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the films 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous Batman films were given special-edition DVD releases on the same day as the  Batman Begins  DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.      There was an undercurrent theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of an aspect of his parents death that he hadnt faced which was finding his fathers diary on the night of his parents wake and reading that Bruce insisted his parents go to the theater so he could watch one of the shows, meaning the reason he became Batman was out of the guilt that he was responsible for their deaths.     Many scenes were filmed but deleted from the film; other scenes had footage removed. These included:     The escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. ": null

He discovers Two-Faces escape, encountering his psychologist hanged in Two-Faces cell with The Bat Must Die written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the films opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience. This scene appears in the comic adaptation and the novelization. Segments of the scene also appears on the U2 music video of Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me.   When Two-Face addresses the crowd from the helicopter in the opening action scene, the speech was truncated and several lines that appeared in the Theatrical Trailer were removed, including the line If the Bat wants to play, well play!   In the bank heist in the beginning of the film, after Two-Faces men shoots the elevator, Batman appeared and asks the men and Two-Face, Going Down? His line was cut and only appeared in the films trailer.   There was a sequence that contained an extended fight scene between Two-Face and Batman, where they both struggle for control of the helicopter. In this scene, Two-Face accuses Batman of being a killer too . Two-face then manages to escape by the parachute, after Batman realizes he has locked the steering wheel into position. This sequence is included in rough form on the special-edition DVD.   A scene right before Edward Nygma arrived at Wayne Manor. It featured Bruce Wayne watching a local Gotham talk show with Chase Meridian as a guest, talking about Batman.   One scene right before Riddler and Two-face team up featured a little conversation with Dick and Bruce in the gym of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.   The scene where the Riddler fails to punch a security guard out. The guard is then brutally beaten by the Riddler using his cane.   One sequence came directly after the casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up at the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place , in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobiles tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special-edition DVD.

An extended scene established Bruce in the Batcave shortly after having discussed with Dick then that this would have saved his life after the battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase.

The scene involving Chase Meridian on the couch originally included a longer ending where the Riddler injects her with a green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door.

He realizes he had misread it, and his father had written even though Bruce insists, we wanted to see Zorro so his show will have to wait until next week. Bruce realizes his parents death was not his fault after all. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms to match the wing anatomy of the bat and the shot shows that they are one.
