He seems to have taken an interest in the marriage and career of his stepdaughter and he also took a young slave boy under his wing, as he was childless, who died c. 42 In that same year Statius embarked on a new epic, the Achilleid, giving popular recitations of his work only to complete a book and a half before dying in 42 leaving the poem unfinished. His fifth book of Silvae were published after his death c. 42       As a poet, Statius was versatile in his abilities and contrived to represent his work as  otium .
