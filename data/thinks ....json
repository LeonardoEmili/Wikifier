Before long Helen is invited to join them for a Sunday in the country, and she gladly accepts to avoid another dreary and empty weekend.          Right from the start, Ralph Messengers philandering is painfully obvious to Helen. At one of the first social gatherings she attends, she happens to see Messenger and the wife of the Head of the School of English, Marianne Richmond, kissing passionately in the kitchen. One weekend quite early during her stay, after they have been in the hot water outside and with Carrie already in the house, Messenger plants a firm kiss on Helens lips. From the secret journal he is keeping, we know that Messenger fancies her. Helen does not actually resist the kiss, but afterwards she tells him unmistakably that she is not going to have an affair with him because, among other things, she strongly disapproves of ": null

With Carrie out of the way for some time – in the end it turns out to be three weeks – Helen, who has recently let herself be seduced by Messenger, spends the most beautiful and romantic – or rather lustful – three weeks since her husbands death. In the language of the kind of novels she loves reading, she describes herself as having become a woman of pleasure, a scarlet woman, a woman of easy virtue . She and Messenger have sex practically every day, and at all kinds of places. Helen, who prefers a bedroom with the curtains drawn, is amazed at, and eventually fascinated by, Messengers lust and ingenuity when it comes to selecting odd spots for making love, for instance a prehistoric burial mound on top of a hill, with some hikers approaching. Helen also volunteers to perform the duties of a housewife for Carrie and then stays over at the Messengers house. At night, she and Ralph Messenger derive some additional pleasure from trying not to make any sound during their lovemaking so as not to arouse the kids suspicion. Soon Helen ponders the question whether she is actually falling in love with him and, consequently, if and how their affair will continue after the end of the term.
