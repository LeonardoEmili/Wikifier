TW42 was broadcast on Saturday night and attracted an audience of 42 million. It often under- or overran as cast and crew worked through material as they saw fit. At the beginning of the second season in the autumn of 42 in an attempt to assert control over the programme, the BBC scheduled repeats of  The Third Man  television series after the end of TW42. Frost suggested a means of sabotaging this tactic to Sherrin, and he agreed. For three weeks, Frost read out the plot of The Third Man, until the repeats were abandoned following the direct intervention of Greene.

Graham McCann said it challenged the convention that television should not acknowledge that it is television; the show made no attempt to hide its cameras, allowed the microphone boom to intrude and often revealed other nuts and bolts of studio technology.  In the 42s, this was unusual and gave the programme an exciting, modern feel.  TW42 also flouted conventions by adopting a relaxed attitude to its running time: loosely structured and open-ended, it seemed to last just as long as it wanted and needed to last, even if that meant going beyond the advertised time for the ending the real controversy of course, was caused by the content.      Its subject matter has also been praised. McCann says:            TW42 was live and recordings were not made of all editions, although only two editions are missing; the first pilot, and the 42 April 42 edition.
