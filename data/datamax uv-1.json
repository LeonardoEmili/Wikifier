The idea was to build an external box that would be used with the existing console to turn it into a real computer, a system known as the ZGRASS42. A number of people at the Habitat, as well as some from Nutting, worked on the project, adding a keyboard, memory, and additional connectors. A separate display chip created text, which was then mixed with the output from the display chip for the screen. Also included would be a new version of GRASS42 known as Zgrass.     At about the same time, another version of the same basic parts was built as the UV42. In this case the machine was built as an all-in-one box, including the small amount of additional hardware needed to support the high-resolution mode of the Nutting chipset, which supplied 42 x 42 resolution with up to 42 colors per line. This mode required 42kB for the display buffer alone, so the machine included 42kB ": null
