The other characters in the book are also well developed, according to Benson. He considers that the head of the Turkish office, Darko Kerim Bey, is one of Flemings more colourful characters ; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel  and Colombo .

Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes. Eco—and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels—consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a sexually neuter individual.

According to Higson, Fleming spent the first four novels changing the style of his books, and his approach to his characters, but in From Russia, with Love the author finally hits on the classic Bond formula, and he happily moved into his most creative phase . The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that the previous novels were, in essence, episodic detective stories, while From Russia, with Love is structured differently, with an extended opening picture that describes Grant, the Russians and Romanova before moving onto the main story and then bringing back some of the elements when least expected. The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book, and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven. Eco identifies that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a cleverly presented beginning, similar to the opening of a film. Eco remarks that Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill .     Benson describes the Fleming Sweep as taking the reader from one chapter to another using hooks at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next. He feels that the Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot of From Russia, with Love and, though it was the longest of Flemings novels, the Sweep makes it seem half as long . ": null

As in Casino Royale, the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post-Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel. The journalist William Cook observes that, with the British Empire in decline Bond pandered to Britains inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight. Woollacott and Bennett agree, and maintain that Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining.  In From Russia, with Love, this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bonds conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England we dont show teeth any more—only gums.
