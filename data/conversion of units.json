This is sometimes called soft conversion. It does not involve changing the physical configuration of the item being measured.     By contrast, a hard conversion or an adaptive conversion may not be exactly equivalent. It changes the measurement to convenient and workable numbers and units in the new system. It sometimes involves a slightly different configuration, or size substitution, of the item. ": null

        " are sometimes allowed and used.       A conversion factor is used to change the units of a measured quantity without changing its value. The unity bracket method of unit conversion  consists of a fraction in which the denominator is equal to the numerator, but they are in different units. Because of the identity property of multiplication, the value of a quantity will not change as long as it is multiplied by one.  Also, if the numerator and denominator of a fraction are equal to each other, then the fraction is equal to one. So as long as the numerator and denominator of the fraction are equivalent, they will not affect the value of the measured quantity.     The following example demonstrates how the unity bracket method  is used to convert the rate 5 kilometers per second to meters per second. The symbols km, m, and s represent kilometer, meter, and second, respectively.     \\frac   \\cdot \\frac \\frac   \\frac     Thus, it is found that 5 kilometers per second is equal to 5000 meters per second.       There are many conversion tools. They are found in the function libraries of applications such as spreadsheets databases, in calculators, and in macro packages and plugins for many other applications such as the mathematical, scientific and technical applications.     There are many standalone applications that offer the thousands of the various units with conversions. For example, the ": null
