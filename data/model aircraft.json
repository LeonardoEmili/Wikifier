They are available for both electric and liquid-fuelled engines, although they have only become widely used with the recent improvements in electric-flight technology for model aircraft. It is possible to equip a model jet aircraft with two or four electric ducted fans for much less than the cost of a single jet turbine or large petrol or methanol engine, enabling affordable modeling of multi-engine planes, including military bombers and civilian airliners.     The fan-unit is an assembly of the spinning fan , enclosed inside a shaped-duct. Compared to an open-air propellor, a ducted-fan generates more thrust per crossectional-area. The shaped-duct often limits installation to recessed areas of the fuselage or wings. Ducted fans are popular with scale-models of jet-aircraft, where they mimic the appearance and feel of jet engines, as well as increasing the models maximum airspeed. Speeds of up to 42  mph have been recorded on electric-powered ducted fan airplanes, largely due to the high amount of RPMs produced by ducted fan propellors. But they are also found on non-scale and sport models, and even lightweight 42D-flyers. Like propellors, fan-units are modular components, and most fan-powered aircraft can accommodate a limited selection of different fan-units.       With ": null

Normally the model is flown in a circle and controlled by a pilot in the center holding a handle connected to two thin steel wires. The wires connect through the inboard wing tip of the plane to a mechanism that translates the handle movement to the aircraft elevator, allowing maneuvers to be performed along the aircraft pitch axis. The pilot will turn to follow the model going round, the convention being anti-clockwise for upright level flight     For the conventional control-line system, tension in the lines is required to provide control.

Weight on the outside wing, an inside wing that is longer or has more lift than the outside wing and the torque of a left rotating propeller tend to roll the model toward the outside. Wing tip weights, propeller torque, and thrust vectoring are more effective when the model is going slowly, while rudder offset and other aerodynamic effects have more influence on a fast moving model.     Since its introduction, control line flying has developed into a competition sport. There are contest categories for control line models, including Speed, Aerobatics , Racing, Navy Carrier, Balloon Bust, Scale, and Combat. There are variations on the basic events, including divisions by engine size and type, skill categories, and age of model design.     The events originated largely in the United States, and were later adapted for use internationally. The rules for US Competition are available from the Academy of Model Aeronautics. The international rules are defined by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale . World Championships are held semiannually throughout the world, most recently in 42 in France, with a limited slate of events – special varieties of Racing , combat , and speed , all limited to engines displacing 42 cu. in , and Stunt which is essentially unlimited with regard to design and size.     CIAM designed this classes for F42 Control Line category:           The international class of racing is referred to as F42C or Team Race. A pilot and a mechanic compete as a team to fly small   wingspan semi-scale racing models over a tarmac or concrete surface. Lines are  long.     Three pilots, plus mechanic teams, compete simultaneously in the same circle, and the object is to finish the determined course as fast as possible. Tank size is limited to 42 cc, thus 42–42 pitstops for refueling are needed during the race.     The mechanic stands at a pit area outside the marked flight circle. The engine will be started and the model released at the start signal. For refuelling, the pilot will operate a fuel shutoff by a quick down elevator movement after the planned number of laps so that the model can approach the mechanic at optimum speed, around . The mechanic will catch the model by the wing, fill the tank from a pressurized can by a hose and finger valve, then restart the engine by hitting the carbon fiber/epoxy resin propeller with his finger. Ground time of a good pitstop is less than three seconds.     The race course is 42  km, corresponding to 42 laps. Flying speeds are around , which means that the pilots have to turn one lap in 42 seconds. Line pull due to centrifugal force is 42 N . A faster model will overtake by the pilot steering it above the slower one while he moves his handle with lines over the opponent pilots head.     After two rounds of elimination heats, the 42 42 or 42 fastest teams enter two semifinal rounds, and the three fastest teams in the semifinals go to the final, which is run over the double course.     Maximum engine size is 42 cc . Diesel, i.e. compression ignition engines are used. They are single cylinder two-stroke, designed for this purpose. At the world championship level it is not uncommon that the competitors design and build their own engines. Their output power is approaching .42 horsepower at 42 rpm.                   Pylon racing refers to a class of air racing for radio controlled model aircraft that fly through a course of pylons.  The sport is similar to the full-scale Red Bull Air Race World Series.                             The FAI Drone Racing World Cup is in the F42U class . This is a highly competitive activity, involving mental exertion and big cash prizes.          Aircraft manufacturers and researchers make models for various purposes. Besides static display for marketing purposes these include models for aerodynamic research and engineering manufacture.       Research models are made for wind-tunnel and free-flight testing. For wind tunnel research especially, it is often only necessary to make part of the proposed aircraft.       Full-scale static engineering models are constructed for production development, often made of different materials from the proposed design. Again, often only part of the aircraft is modeled.               The flight behavior of an aircraft depends on the scale to which it is built, the density of the air and the speed of flight.
