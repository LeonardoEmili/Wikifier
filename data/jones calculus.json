When light crosses an optical element the resulting polarization of the emerging light is found by taking the product of the Jones matrix of the optical element and the Jones vector of the incident light.

The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the two components of Jones vectors is proportional to the intensity of light.

For example, a Jones vectors component of i indicates retardation by \\pi/2 compared to 1 . Circular polarisation described under Jones convention is called : From the point of view of the receiver . Collett uses the opposite definition for the phase . Circular polarisation described under Colletts convention is called : From the point of view of the source .

For example, if the fast axis of a quarter wave plate is horizontal, then the phase velocity along the horizontal direction is ahead of the vertical direction i.e., E_x leads E_y . Thus, \\phi_x 0 means that E_y doesnt attain the same value as E_x until a later time, i.e. E_x leads E_y .
