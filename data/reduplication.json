The phrase hina mina means scattered, like a large collection of objects spilled in all different directions.

        ", there are three kinds of reduplication. Göksel & Kerslake     Emphatic Reduplication: A word can be reduplicated partially, such that an emphatic stem is created to be attached to the adjective. This is done by taking the first syllable of the adjective, dropping the syllable-final phoneme, and adding one of four interpolated consonants . For example, kırmızı becomes kıpkırmızı ; mavi becomes masmavi ; yeşil becomes yemyeşil , and temiz becomes tertemiz . However, the consonant added to the emphatic stem is unpredictable grammatically-speaking, however phonological studies, such as Wedel Wedel do shed new light on the subject.   M-Reduplication : A word can be reduplicated while replacing the initial consonants  with m. The effect is that the meaning of the original word is broadened. For example, tabak means plate , and tabak mabak then means plates, dishes and such . This can be applied not only to nouns but to all kinds of words, as in yeşil meşil meaning green, greenish, whatever . Although not used in formal written Turkish, it is a completely standard and fully accepted construction.   Doubling: A word can be reduplicated totally, giving a related but different meaning or used for emphasizing. For example, zaman zaman meaning occasionally ; uzun uzun meaning very long or many things long . This type is used also in formal Turkish, especially in literature.

This construction can be ambiguous because of its use of a genitive noun followed by a nominative noun, which is not unique to reduplication. For instance the reduplicated form suurensuuri jalka sounds the same as suuren suuri jalka .       Reduplication is usually rhyming. It can add emphasis: pici -           ": null
