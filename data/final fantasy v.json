This system was first established in  Final Fantasy IV , but in that game, there was no way to visibly anticipate which characters turn would come up next. In Final Fantasy V, the player can see which playable characters turn is next in battle, in the form of a time gauge—or ATB Bar —which fills according to a characters speed. When the selected characters turn arrives, the player can execute one of several commands, such as attacking the enemy with an equipped weapon, using a special ability or item, or changing the characters row position. The ATB mechanic with a gauge, as seen in Final Fantasy V, would be used in the four following main titles in the series and remains a staple mechanic of the franchise.             The main feature of the gameplay of Final Fantasy V is the Job System. Players can freely select jobs for their characters to master, allowing each character to gain special abilities and potentially master all 42 jobs . Each character begins with only the Freelancer class; to gain access to new jobs, players must acquire crystal shards.

Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorites fall. Exploring a cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.     Eventually, the party comes to discover that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. King Tycoon, who was controlled by Exdeath to destroy the last Crystal, sacrifices himself to save the others. Galufs granddaughter Krile arrives by a meteorite, restoring Galufs memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others resolve that the fight is not Galufs alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that worlds Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeaths lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galufs kingdom.     The party meets Xezat, one of Galufs companions and a former Warrior of Dawn, and learn that Bartzs father was part of their group. Joining forces, they deactivate the barrier around Exdeaths castle, but at the cost of Xezats life. They then learn of Exdeaths origins, traveling to the Guardian Tree to dispel the seals. Exdeath anticipates the partys actions and torches Moore Forest, ensnaring the group. Krile arrives to help but is herself trapped by the warlocks powers. At the sight of his granddaughters capture, Galuf frees himself and battles Exdeath to the point of death, refusing to fall until the creature flees. Collapsing from his wounds, Galuf dies despite the partys efforts to save him, imparting his abilities to Krile. The party pursues Exdeath to his tower and defeats him, but the remaining Crystals shatter and the worlds are reunited.     For a time, it seems Exdeath has been truly destroyed, and the party celebrates in Tycoon. Bartz, however, is contacted by the sage Ghido. Meeting with him, a thorn suddenly leaps from Kriles palm, manifesting as Exdeath, now resurrected and fully in command of the Void. With it, he removes entire towns and kingdoms from existence, tossing them into a tear in reality.     Fortunately for the party, the reunification of worlds has opened the pathways to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuos rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath at the center of the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The games ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeaths defeat, detailing the events after the worlds resurrection. In the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.       Final Fantasy V was ": null
