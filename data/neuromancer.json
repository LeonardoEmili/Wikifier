After viewing the first 42 minutes of landmark cyberpunk film  Blade Runner  , which was released when Gibson had written a third of the novel, he figured Neuromancer was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I’d copied my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film. He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the book 42 times, feared losing the readers attention and was convinced that he would be permanently shamed following its publication; yet what resulted was seen as a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist. He added the final sentence of the novel at the last minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, but ended up doing precisely that with  Count Zero  , a character-focused work set in the Sprawl alluded to in its predecessor.

The password must be spoken into an ornate computer terminal located in Villa Straylight, and entered simultaneously as Case pierces the software barriers in cyberspace—otherwise the Turing lock will remain intact.     Armitages team attracts the attention of the Turing Police, whose job is to prevent AIs from exceeding their built-in limitations.

The text is one about regeneration and endurance. Forms arise, undergo transformations, and continue metamorphosed. Gibson becomes the new romancer behind Neuromancer, revitalizing the science fiction novel, the quest story, the myth of the hero, the mystery, the hard-boiled detective novel, the epic, the thriller, and the tales of the cowboy and romantic artist, among others. He represents old stories in a revealing revamped intertexual pastiche.»   ; Linda Lee : A drug addict and resident of Chiba City, she is the former girlfriend of Case, and instigates the initial series of events in the story with a lie about his employers intention to kill him. Her death in Chiba City and later pseudo-resurrection by Neuromancer serves to elicit emotional depth in Case as he mourns her death and struggles with the guilt he feels at rejecting her love and abandoning her both in Chiba City and the simulated reality generated by Neuromancer.
