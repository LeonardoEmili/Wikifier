First, a function  with variable  is said to be continuous at the point  on the real line, if the limit of , as  approaches that point , is equal to the value ; and second, the function  is said to be continuous, if it is continuous at every point. A function is said to be discontinuous  at some point when it is not continuous there. These points themselves are also addressed as discontinuities.     There are several different definitions of continuity of a function. Sometimes a function is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain. In this case, the function , with the domain of all real ,   any integer, is continuous. Sometimes an exception is made for boundaries of the domain. For example, the graph of the function , with the domain of all non-negative reals, has a left-hand endpoint. In this case only the limit from the right is required to equal the value of the function. Under this definition f is continuous at the boundary  and so for all non-negative arguments. The most common and restrictive definition is that a function is continuous if it is continuous at all real numbers. In this case, the previous two examples are not continuous, but every ": null
