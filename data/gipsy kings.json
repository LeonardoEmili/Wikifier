It was famous singer Reyes, however, who was mostly responsible for the new surge of popular interest when he left Manitas de Plata and started a band of his own, made up of his own sons, which he called Los Reyes .     Los Reyes started out as a gypsy band. They traveled around France, playing at weddings, festivals, and in the streets. Because they lived so much like gypsies, the band adopted the name Gipsy Kings.

The Gipsy King line-up featured a combination of left, and right-handed guitarists; three of the Reyes brothers play guitar left-handed, and play left-hand guitars that are strung for right-handers , while Diego Baliardo plays a left-handed guitar that is strung for left hand . Together with right-handers Canut and Paul Reyes, and Paco Baliardo, these guitarists focus on delivering the strong underpinning rhythms while the more complex leads are performed by the right-handed and conventionally styled Tonino Baliardo.       They became popular with their self-titled third album,  Gipsy Kings , which included the songs  Djobi Djoba  ,  Bamboléo  , and the romantic ballad  Un Amor  . Gipsy Kings was popular throughout Europe and in Africa, as well as in the Middle East.     Gipsy Kings was released in the United States in 42 and spent 42 weeks on the charts, one of few ": null
