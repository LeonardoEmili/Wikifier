Shinto is considered one of the two main religions of Japan, the other being Buddhism. Whereas Buddhism places a focus on transcending the cosmos, which it regards as being replete with suffering, Shinto focuses on adapting to the pragmatic requirements of life.          The term Shinto is often translated into English as the way of the kami . It derives from the combination of two Chinese characters: shen, which means kami in Chinese, and dao, which means do in Chinese.

The oldest recorded usage of the word Shindo is from the second half of the sixth century.     Among the terms earliest known appearance in Japan is in the  Nihon Shoki , an eighth-century text. Here, it may simply be used in reference to popular belief, and not merely that of Japan. Alternatively, it is possible that in this Japanese context, the early uses of Shinto were also a reference to Taoism, as many Taoist practices had recently been imported to Japan. It is apparent that in these early Japanese uses, the word Shinto did not apply to a distinct religious tradition nor to anything seen as being uniquely Japanese. In the  Konjaku monogatarishui , composed in the eleventh-century, references are made to a woman in China practicing Shinto rather than Buddhism, indicating that at this time the term Shinto was not used in reference to purely Japanese traditions. The same text also referred to people in India worshipping kami, reflecting use of that term to describe localised deities outside of Japan.

In the  Japanese Portuguese Dictionary  of 42 Shinto is defined as referring to kami or matters pertaining to kami.      In the seventeenth century, under the influence of Edo period thinkers, the practice of kami worship came to be seen as distinct from Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism. The term Shinto only gained common use from the early twentieth century onward, when is superseded the term taikyō as the name for the Japanese state religion.

In Western Japan, the term  jigami  is used to describe the enshrined kami of a village founder. In some cases, living human beings were also viewed as kami. In the State Shinto system of the Meiji era, the Emperor of Japan was declared to be a kami, while several Shinto sects have also viewed their leaders as living kami.          Although some kami are venerated only in a single location, others have shrines devoted to them across many areas of Japan. Hachiman for instance has around 42 shrines dedicated to him. The act of establishing a new shrine to a kami who already has one is called  bunrei  . As part of this, the kami is invited to enter a new place, where it can be venerated, with the instalment ceremony being known as a  kanjo . The new, subsidiary shrine is known as a bunsha. Individual kami are not believed to have their power diminished by their residence in multiple locations, and there is no limit on the number of places a kami can be enshrined. In some periods, fees were charged for the right to enshrine a particular kami in a new place. Shrines are not necessarily always designed as permanent structures.     Many kami are believed to have messengers, known as kami no tsukai or tsuka washime, and these are generally depicted as taking animal form. The messenger of Inari, for example, is depicted as a fox, while the messenger of Hachiman is a dove.   Shinto cosmology also includes  bakemono , spirits who cause malevolent acts. Bakemono include  oni ,  tengu ,  kappa ,  mononoke , and  yamanba . Japanese folklore also incorporates belief in the goryō or onryō, unquiet or vengeful spirits, particularly of those who have died violently and without appropriate funerary rites. These are believed to inflict suffering on the living, meaning that they must be pacified, usually through Buddhist rites but sometimes through enshrining them as a kami.                 The origin of the kami and of Japan itself are recounted in two eighth-century texts,  Kojiki  and  Nihon shoki . These were texts commissioned by ruling elites to legitimate and consolidate their rule, and drew heavily upon Chinese influence. These texts were never of great importance to the religious life of the Japanese. Views regarding the truth of the cosmological stories recounted in these texts have varied. In the early twentieth century, for instance, the Japanese government proclaimed that it was irrefutable history.     These texts recount that the universe started with ame-tsuchi, the separation of light and pure elements  from heavy elements . Three kami then appeared: ": null

In Shinto, the creative principle permeating all life is known as  mutsubi .         A key theme in Shinto thought is the importance of avoiding  kegare  , while ensuring  harae  .

To avoid kegare, priests and other practitioners may engage in abstinence and avoid various activities prior to a festival or ritual.   Various words, termed imi-kotoba, are also regarded as taboo, and people avoid speaking them when at a shrine; these include shi , byō , and shishi .     Full immersion in the sea is often regarded as the most ancient and efficacious form of purification. This act links with the mythological tale in which Izanagi immersed himself in the sea to purify himself after discovering his deceased wife; it was from this act that other kami sprang from his body.   Salt is often regarded as a purifying substance; some Shinto practitioners will for instance sprinkle salt on themselves after a funeral, while those running restaurants may put a small pile of salt outside before business commences each day.

They added that in the modern world, Shinto tends toward conservatism and nationalism.

        ". This generated both domestic and international condemnation, particularly from China and Korea.         Shinto tends to focus on behavior rather than doctrine. The philosophers James W. Boyd and Ron G. Williams stated that Shinto is first and foremost a ritual tradition . As observed by Picken, Shinto is interested not in credenda but in agenda, not in things that should be believed but in things that should be done.    It is often difficult to distinguish Shinto practices from Japanese customs more broadly, with Picken observing that the worldview of Shinto provided the principal source of self-understanding within the Japanese way of life . Nelson stated that Shinto-based orientations and values lie at the core of Japanese culture, society, and character .               Public spaces in which the kami are worshipped are often known under the generic term  jinja  ; this term applies to the location rather than to a specific building. Jinja is usually translated as shrine in English, although in earlier literature was sometimes translated as temple , a term now more commonly reserved for Japans Buddhist structures. By the late twentieth century, the Association of Shinto Shrines estimated that there were approximately 42 shrines affiliated to it across Japan, with another 42 being unaffiliated. They are found all over the country, from isolated rural areas to dense metropolitan ones. Some of the grand shrines with imperial associations are termed jingū.     The architectural styles of Shinto shrines had largely developed by the Heian period. The inner sanctuary in which the kami is believed to live is known as a  honden . Typically, human worshippers carry out their acts outside of the honden. Near the honden can sometimes be found a subsidiary shrine, the  bekkū , to another kami; the kami inhabiting this shrine is not necessarily perceived as being inferior to that in the honden. At some places, halls of worship have been erected, termed  haiden . On a lower level can be found the hall of offerings, known as a  heiden . Together, the building housing the honden, haiden, and heiden is called a  hongū . In some shrines, there is a separate building in which to conduct additional ceremonies, such as weddings, known as a gishikiden, or a specific building in which the kagura dance is performed, known as the kagura-den. The precincts of the shrine are known as the keidaichi.     The entrance to shrines are marked out by a two-post gateway with either one or two crossbeams atop it, which are known as  torii . These are regarded as demarcating the area where the kami resides. More broadly, torii have also become internationally-recognised symbols of Japan. Their architectural form is distinctly Japanese, although the decision to paint most of them in ": null

        " reflects a Chinese influence dating from the Nara period.     Shrines are often set within gardens, even in cities. The shrine office is known as a shamusho, while various kiosks sell amulets to visitors. Since the late 42s, shrines have had to be financially self-sufficient, relying on the donations of worshippers and visitors. These funds are used to pay the wages of the priests, to finance the upkeep of the buildings, to cover the shrines membership fees of various regional and national Shinto groups, and to contribute to disaster relief funds.     In Shinto, it is seen as important that the places in which kami are venerated by kept clean and not neglected. Through to the Edo period, it was common for Shinto shrines to be demolished and rebuild at a nearby location so as to remove any pollutants and ensure purity. This has continued into recent times at certain sites, such as the Ise Grand Shrine, which is moved to an adjacent site every two decades. Separate shrines can also be merged in a process known as jinja gappei. Shrines may have legends about their foundation, which are known as en-gi. These sometimes also record miracles associated with the shrine. From the Heian period on, the en-gi were often retold on picture scrolls known as emaki-mono.     miko     Shrines may be cared for by priests, by local communities, or by families on whose property the shrine is found. Shinto priests are known in Japanese as  Kannushi , meaning proprietor of kami . Many kannushi take on the role in a line of hereditary succession traced down specific families.

        ".  Priests can rise through the ranks over the course of their careers. The number of priests at a particular shrine can vary; some shrines can have over 42 priests, and others have none, instead being administered by local lay volunteers. Some priests earn a living administering to multiple small shrines, sometimes over ten or more.     Priestly dress includes a tall, rounded hat known as an eboshi, and black lacquered wooden clogs known as asa-gutsu. Also part of standard priestly attire is a hiōgi fan. The outer garment worn by a priest, usually colored black, red, or light blue, is the hō, or the ikan. A white silk version of the ikan, used for formal occasions, is known as the saifuku. Another priestly robe is the kariginu, which is modelled on Heian-style hunting garments.          The chief priest at a shrine is known as a gūji. As with teachers, instructors, and Buddhist clergy, Shinto priests are often referred to as  sensei  by lay practitioners. Historically, there were various female priests although they were largely pushed out of their positions in 42 During the Second World War, women were again allowed to become priests to fill the void caused by large numbers of men being enlisted in the military. In the early twenty-first century, male priests have still dominated Shinto institutions. Male priests are free to marry and have children.   Before certain major festivals, priests may undergo a period of abstinence from sexual relations. Some of those involved in festivals also abstain from a range of other things, such as consuming tea, coffee, or alcohol, immediately prior to the events.     The priests are assisted by jinja miko, sometimes referred to as shrine-maidens in English. These  miko  are typically unmarried,, although not necessarily virgins. In many cases they are the daughters of a priest or a practitioner. They are subordinate to the priests in the shrine hierarchy. Their most important role is in the  kagura  dance, known as  otome-mai . Miko receive only a small salary but gain respect from members of the local community and learn skills such as cooking, calligraphy, painting, and etiquette which can benefit them when later searching for employment or a marriage partner. They generally do not live at the shrines. Sometimes they fill other roles, such as being secretaries in the shrine offices or clerks at the information desks, or as waitresses at the naorai feasts. They also assist Kannushi in ceremonial rites.         Individual worship conducted at a shrine is known as  hairei . A visit to a shrine, which is known as jinja mairi in Japanese, typically takes only a few minutes. Some individuals visit the shrines every day, often as on their route to work each morning.   The general procedure entails an individual approaching the honden, where they place a monetary offering in a box before ringing a bell to call the attention of the kami. Then, they bow, clap, and stand while silently offering a prayer. The clapping is known as kashiwade or hakushu. The prayers or supplications offered to the kami are known as kigan. When at the shrine, individuals offering prayers are not necessarily praying to a specific kami. A worshipper may not know the name of a kami residing at the shrine nor how many kami are believed to dwell there. Unlike in certain other religious traditions such as Christianity and Islam, Shinto shrines do not have weekly services that practitioners are expected to attend.          Some Shinto practitioners do not offer their prayers to the kami directly, but rather request that a priest offer them on their behalf; these prayers are known as kitō. Many individuals approach the kami asking for pragmatic requests. Requests for rain, known as amagoi have been found across Japan, with Inari a popular choice for such requests.   Other prayers reflect more contemporary concerns. For instance, people may ask that the priest approaches the kami so as to the purify their car in the hope that this will prevent it from being involved in an accident.   Before a building is constructed, it is common for either private individuals or the construction company to employ a Shinto priest to come to the land being developed and perform the  jichinsai , or earth sanctification ritual. This purifies the site and asks the kami to bless it.     People often ask the kami to help offset inauspicious events that may affect them. For instance, in Japanese culture, the age 42 is seen as being unlucky for women and the age 42 for men, and thus people can ask the kami to offset any ill-fortune associated with being this age. Certain directions can also be seen as being inauspicious for certain people at certain times and thus people can approach the kami asking them to offset this problem if they have to travel in one of these unlucky directions.

This entails an individual sprinkling water on the face and hands, a procedure known as temizu, using a font known as a  temizuya . Another form of purification at the start of a Shinto rite entails waving a white paper streamer or wand known as the  haraigushi . When not in use, the haraigushi is usually kept in a stand. The priest waves the haraigushi horizontally over a person or object being purified in a movement known as sa-yu-sa . Sometimes, instead of a haraigushi, the purification is carried out with a o-nusa, a branch of evergreen to which strips of paper have been attached.     The acts of purification accomplished, petitions known as norito are spoken to the kami. This is followed by an appearance by the miko, who commence in a slow circular motion before the main altar.     Following the purification procedure, offerings are presented to the kami by being placed on a table. This act is known as hōbei.   Historically, the offerings given the kami included food, cloth, swords, and horses.   In the contemporary period, lay worshippers usually give gifts of money to the kami while priests generally offer them food, drink, and sprigs of the sacred  sakaki  tree. A common offering in the present are sprigs of the  sakaki  tree. Animal sacrifices are not considered appropriate offerings, as the shedding of blood is seen as a vile act that necessitates purification. The offerings presented are sometimes simple and sometimes more elaborate; at the Grand Shrine of Ise, for instance, 42 styles of food are laid out as offerings.          After the offerings have been given, people often sip rice wine known as o-miki. Drinking the o-miki wine is seen as a form of communion with the kami. On important occasions, a feast is then held, known as naorai, inside a banquet hall attached to the shrine complex.     The Kami are believed to enjoy music.

During rituals, people visiting the shrine are expected to sit in the  seiza  style, with their legs tucked beneath their bottom. To avoid cramps, individuals who hold this position for a lengthy period of time may periodically move their legs and flex their heels.              Many people also have a  kamidana  or family shrine in their home. The popularity of such kamidana increased greatly during the Meiji era. Kamidana can also be found in work-places, restaurants, shops, and ocean-going ships. These often feature small shrines enshrining the kami of a nearby public shrine as well as a tutelary kami associated with the houses occupants or their profession. They can be decorated with miniature torii and shimenawa and include amulets obtained from public shrines; some public shrines sell entire kamidana. Daily offerings of rice, salt, and water are often made at kamidana, with sake and other items also being offered on special days. Along with the kamidana, many Japanese households also have  butsudan , Buddhist altars enshrining the ancestors of the family.     Household Shinto can focus attention on the dōzoku-shin, kami who are perceived to be ancestral to the  dōzoku  or extended kinship group. Small village shrines containing the tutelary kami of an extended family are known as iwai-den.     In addition to the temple shrines and the household shrines, Shinto also features small wayside shrines known as  hokora . Other open spaces used for the worship of kami are  iwasaka , an area surrounded by sacred rocks.             The use of amulets are widely sanctioned and popular in Japan. These may be made of paper, wood, cloth, metal, or plastic.    Ema  are small wooden plaques that wishes or desires are written upon and left at a place in the shrine grounds so that one may get a wish or desire fulfilled. They have a picture on them and are frequently associated with the larger Shrines.

More recently, there are also amulets to promote good driving, good business, and success at school. Their history lies with Buddhist practice of selling amulets. Omamori and ofuda are sometimes placed within a charm bag known as a  kinchaku , typically worn by small children.      Omikuji  are paper lots upon which personal fortunes are written.

Everything from the setup of the instruments to the most subtle sounds and the arrangement of the music is crucial to encouraging the kami to come down and dance. The songs are used as magical devices to summon the gods and as prayers for blessings. Rhythm patterns of five and seven are common, possibly relating to the Shinto belief of the twelve generations of heavenly and earthly deities.

Therefore, kagura is a rite of tama shizume, of pacifying the spirits of the departed. In the Heian period, this was one of the important rites at the Imperial Court and had found its fixed place in the tama shizume festival in the eleventh month. At this festival people sing as accompaniment to the dance: Depart! Depart! Be cleansed and go! Be purified and leave! Kobayashi, Kazushige; Knecht, Peter, On the Meaning of Masked Dances in Kagura , Asian Folklore Studies 42 : 42 42 pp. 42–42   This rite of purification is also known as chinkon. It was used for securing and strengthening the soul of a dying person. It was closely related to the ritual of tama furi , to call back the departed soul of the dead or to energize a weakened spirit. Spirit pacification and rejuvenation were usually achieved by songs and dances, also called asobi. The ritual of chinkon continued to be performed on the emperors of Japan, thought to be descendants of Amaterasu. It is possible that this ritual is connected with the ritual to revive the sun goddess during the low point of the winter solstice.

        ", Shinto shrines should hold their festival celebrations on hare-no-hi or clear days , the days of the new, full, and half moons. Other days, known as ke-no-hi, were generally avoided for festivities. However, since the late 42th century, many shines have held their festival celebrations on the Saturday or Sunday closest to the date so that fewer individuals will be working and will be able to attend the festivities.     Spring festivals are called haru-matsuri and often incorporate prayers for a good harvest. They sometimes incorporate ta-asobi ceremonies, in which rice is ritually planted.   Autumn festivals are known as aki-matsuri and primarily focus on thanking the kami for the rice or other harvest. The  Niiname-sai , or festival of new rice, is held across many Shinto shrines on 42 November. Winter festivals, called fuyu no matsuri often feature on welcoming in the spring, expelling evil, and calling in good influences for the future. There is little difference between winter festivals and specific new year festivals.          Many people visit shrines to celebrate new year; this first visit of the year is known as hatsumōde or hatsumairi. There, they buy amulets and talismans to bring them good fortune over the coming year. To celebrate this festival, many Japanese put up rope known as  shimenawa  on their hopes and places of business. Some also put up  kadomatsu  , an arrangement of pine branches, plum tree, and bamboo sticks. Also displayed are  kazari , which are smaller and more colourful; their purpose is to keep away misfortune and attract good fortune. In many places, new year celebrations incorporate  hadaka matsuri  in which men dressed only in a  fundoshi  loincloth, engage in a particular activity, such as fighting over a specific object or immersing themselves in a river.

A common ritual, the  hatsumiyamairi , entails a childs first visit to a Shinto shrine. A tradition holds that if a boy, the child should be brought to the shrine on the thirty-second day after birth, and if a girl it should be brought on the thirty-third day. Historically, the child was commonly brought to the shrine not by the mother, who was considered impure after birth, but by another female relative; since the late 42th century it has been more common for the mother to do so.   Another, the  saiten-sai , is a coming of age ritual marking the transition to adulthood and occurs when an individual is around twenty.     Wedding ceremonies are often carried out at Shinto shrines. In Japan, funerals tend to take place at Buddhist temples; Bocking noted that most Japanese people are still born Shinto yet die Buddhist.  In Shinto thought, contact with death is seen as imparting impurity ; the period following this contact is known as kibuku and is associated with various taboos. In cases when dead humans are enshrined as kami, the physical remains of the dead are not stored at the shrine.   Shinto funerals were established during the Tokugawa period and focused on two themes: concern for the fate of the corpse and maintenance of the relationship between the living and the dead.  There are at least twenty steps involved in burying the dead. Mourners wear solid black in a day of mourning called Kichu-fuda and a Shinto priest will perform various rituals. People will give monetary gifts to the deceaseds family called Koden, and Kotsuge is the gathering of the deceaseds ashes. Some of the ashes are taken by family members to put in their home shrines at the step known as Bunkotsu.             Divination is the focus of many Shinto rituals. Among the ancient forms of divination found in Japan are  rokuboku  and  kiboku .

The priest Gyogi is known for his belief in assimilation of Shinto Kami and Buddhas. Shinto kami are commonly being seen by Buddhist clergy as guardians of manifestation, guardians, or pupils of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.

Most Japanese people participate in several religious traditions. The main exceptions to this are members of smaller, minority religious groups, including Christianity and several new religions, which promote exclusivist worldviews.   Determining the proportions of the countrys population who engage in Shinto activity is hindered by the fact that, if asked, Japanese people will often say I have no religion .
