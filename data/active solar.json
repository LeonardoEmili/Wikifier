        ", and are therefore classified under active solar technology.     Some of the basic benefits of active systems is that controls can be used to maximize their effectiveness. For example, a passive solar thermal array which does not rely on pumps and sensors will only start circulating when a certain amount of internal energy has built up in the system. Using sensors and pumps, a relatively small amount of energy can harvest a far larger amount of available thermal energy by switching on as soon as a useful temperature differential becomes present. Controls also allow a greater variety of choices for utilizing the energy that becomes available. For example, a solar thermal array could heat a swimming pool on a relatively cool morning where heating a domestic hot water cylinder was impractical due to the different stored water temperatures. Later in the day as the temperature rises the controls could be used to switch the solar heated water over to the cylinder instead.     Disadvantages of active solar systems include that the external power sources can fail and that controls require maintenance.     Most solar collectors are fixed in their array position mounting, but can have a higher performance if they track the path of the sun through the sky . ": null
