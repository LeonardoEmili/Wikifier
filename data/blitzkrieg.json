Implementation of higher orders remained within limits determined by the training doctrine of an elite officer-corps. Delegation of authority to local commanders increased the tempo of operations, which had great influence on the success of German armies in the early war period. Seeckt, who believed in the Prussian tradition of mobility, developed the German army into a mobile force, advocating technical advances that would lead to a qualitative improvement of its forces and better coordination between motorized infantry, tanks, and planes.          The British army took lessons from the successful infantry and artillery offensives on the Western Front in late 42 To obtain the best co-operation between all arms, emphasis was placed on detailed planning, rigid control and adherence to orders. Mechanization of the army was considered a means to avoid mass casualties and indecisive nature of offensives, as part of a combined-arms theory of war. The four editions of Field Service Regulations published after 42 held that only combined-arms operations could create enough fire power to enable mobility on a battlefield.

German successes are closely related to the extent to which the German Luftwaffe was able to control the air war in early campaigns in Western and Central Europe, and the Soviet Union. However, the Luftwaffe was a broadly based force with no constricting central doctrine, other than its resources should be used generally to support national strategy. It was flexible and it was able to carry out both operational-tactical, and strategic bombing. Flexibility was the Luftwaffes strength in 42–42 Paradoxically, from that period onward it became its weakness.

In fact, far from it being a specialist panzer spearhead arm, less than 42 percent of the Luftwaffe was intended for close support of the army in 42         The concepts associated with the term blitzkrieg—deep penetrations by armour, large encirclements, and combined arms attacks—were largely dependent upon terrain and weather conditions. Where the ability for rapid movement across tank country was not possible, armoured penetrations often were avoided or resulted in failure. Terrain would ideally be flat, firm, unobstructed by natural barriers or fortifications, and interspersed with roads and railways. If it were instead hilly, wooded, marshy, or urban, armour would be vulnerable to infantry in close-quarters combat and unable to break out at full speed. Additionally, units could be halted by mud  or extreme snow. Operation Barbarossa helped confirm that armour effectiveness and the requisite aerial support were dependent on weather and terrain. It should however be noted that the disadvantages of terrain could be nullified if surprise was achieved over the enemy by an attack through areas considered natural obstacles, as occurred during the Battle of France when the German blitzkrieg-style attack went through the Ardennes. Since the French thought the Ardennes unsuitable for massive troop movement, particularly for tanks, they were left with only light defences which were quickly overrun by the Wehrmacht. The Germans quickly advanced through the forest, knocking down the trees the French thought would impede this tactic.          The influence of air forces over forces on the ground changed significantly over the course of the Second World War. Early German successes were conducted when Allied aircraft could not make a significant impact on the battlefield. In May 42 there was near parity in numbers of aircraft between the Luftwaffe and the Allies, but the Luftwaffe had been developed to support Germanys ground forces, had liaison officers with the mobile formations, and operated a higher number of sorties per aircraft. In addition, German air parity or superiority allowed the unencumbered movement of ground forces, their unhindered assembly into concentrated attack formations, aerial reconnaissance, aerial resupply of fast moving formations and close air support at the point of attack. The Allied air forces had no close air support aircraft, training or doctrine. The Allies flew 42 French and 42 British sorties a day but methods of attacking ground targets had yet to be developed; therefore Allied aircraft caused negligible damage. Against these 42 sorties the Luftwaffe on average flew 42 sorties a day. On May 42 Fliegerkorps VIII flew 42 sorties in support of the crossing of the Meuse. The following day the Allies made repeated attempts to destroy the German pontoon bridges, but German fighter aircraft, ground fire and Luftwaffe flak batteries with the panzer forces destroyed 42 percent of the attacking Allied aircraft while the bridges remained intact.     Allied air superiority became a significant hindrance to German operations during the later years of the war. By June 42 the Western Allies had complete control of the air over the battlefield and their fighter-bomber aircraft were very effective at attacking ground forces. On D-Day the Allies flew 42 sorties over the battlefield area alone, not including sorties flown over north-western Europe. Against this on 42 June the Luftwaffe flew some 42 sorties. Though German fighter presence over Normandy increased over the next days and weeks, it never approached the numbers the Allies commanded. Fighter-bomber attacks on German formations made movement during daylight almost impossible. Subsequently, shortages soon developed in food, fuel and ammunition, severely hampering the German defenders. German vehicle crews and even flak units experienced great difficulty moving during daylight. Indeed, the final German offensive operation in the west, ": null

Under these conditions it was difficult for German commanders to employ the armoured idea , if at all.       Blitzkrieg is vulnerable to an enemy that is robust enough to weather the shock of the attack and that does not panic at the idea of enemy formations in its rear area. This is especially true if the attacking formation lacks the reserve to keep funnelling forces into the spearhead, or lacks the mobility to provide infantry, artillery and supplies into the attack.

        " argues:          Historian Victor Davis Hanson states that Blitzkrieg played on the myth of German technological superiority and industrial dominance, adding that German successes, particularly that of its Panzer divisions were instead predicated on the poor preparation and morale of Germanys enemies.  Hanson also reports that at a Munich public address in November 42 Hitler had disowned the concept of Blitzkrieg by calling it an idiotic word.  Further, successful Blitzkrieg operations were predicated on superior numbers, air-support, and were only possible for short periods of time without sufficient supply lines. For all intents and purposes, Blitzkrieg ended at the Eastern Front once the German forces gave up Stalingrad, after they faced hundreds of new T42 tanks, when the Luftwaffe became unable to assure air dominance, and following the stalemate at Kursk—to this end, Hanson concludes that German military success was not accompanied by the adequate provisioning of its troops with food and materiel far from the source of supply, which contributed to its ultimate failures. Despite its later disappointments as German troops extended their lines at too great a distance, the very specter or armored Blitzkrieg forces initially proved victorious against Polish, Dutch, Belgian, and French armies early in the war.       In the 42s, Alan Milward developed a theory of blitzkrieg economics, that Germany could not fight a long war and chose to avoid comprehensive rearmament and armed in breadth, to win quick victories. Milward described an economy positioned between a full war economy and a peacetime economy. The purpose of the blitzkrieg economy was to allow the German people to enjoy high living standards in the event of hostilities and avoid the economic hardships of the First World War.     Overy wrote that blitzkrieg as a coherent military and economic concept has proven a difficult strategy to defend in light of the evidence . Milwards theory was contrary to Hitlers and German planners intentions. The Germans, aware of the errors of the First World War, rejected the concept of organising its economy to fight only a short war. Therefore, focus was given to the development of armament in depth for a long war, instead of armament in breadth for a short war. Hitler claimed that relying on surprise alone was criminal and that we have to prepare for a long war along with surprise attack . During the winter of 42–42 Hitler demobilised many troops from the army to return as skilled workers to factories because the war would be decided by production, not a quick Panzer operation .     In the 42s, Hitler had ordered rearmament programs that cannot be considered limited. In November 42 Hitler had indicated that most of the armament projects would be completed by 42–42 The rearmament of the  Kriegsmarine  was to have been completed in 42 and the Luftwaffe rearmament program was to have matured in 42 with a force capable of strategic bombing with ": null

Hitlers correspondence with his economists also reveals that his intent was to wage war in 42–42 when the resources of central Europe had been absorbed into the Third Reich.     Living standards were not high in the late 42s. Consumption of consumer goods had fallen from 42 percent in 42 to 42 percent in 42 The demands of the war economy reduced the amount of spending in non-military sectors to satisfy the demand for the armed forces. On 42 September, Göring as Head of the Reich Defence Council, called for complete employment of living and fighting power of the national economy for the duration of the war. Overy presents this as evidence that a blitzkrieg economy did not exist.     Adam Tooze wrote that the German economy was being prepared for a long war. The expenditure for this war was extensive and put the economy under severe strain. The German leadership were concerned less with how to balance the civilian economy and the needs of civilian consumption but to figure out how to best prepare the economy for total war. Once war had begun, Hitler urged his economic experts to abandon caution and expend all available resources on the war effort but the expansion plans only gradually gained momentum in 42 Tooze wrote that the huge armament plans in the pre-war period did not indicate any clear-sighted blitzkrieg economy or strategy.     Heer  was not ready for blitzkrieg at the start of the war. A blitzkrieg method called for a young, highly skilled mechanised army. In 42–42 42 percent of the army was 42 years old and 42 percent of the soldiers had only a few weeks training. The German army, contrary to the blitzkrieg legend, was not fully motorised and had only 42 vehicles, compared to the 42 of the French Army. The British also had an enviable contingent of motorised forces. Thus, the image of the German Blitzkrieg army is a figment of propaganda imagination . During the First World War the German army used 42 million horses for transport and in the Second World War used 42 million horses; only ten percent of the army was motorised in 42     Half of the German divisions available in 42 were combat ready but less well-equipped than the British and French or the Imperial German Army of 42 In the spring of 42 the German army was semi-modern, in which a small number of well-equipped and elite divisions were offset by many second and third rate divisions . In 42 John Mosier wrote that while the French soldiers in 42 were better trained than German soldiers, as were the Americans later and that the German army was the least mechanised of the major armies, its leadership cadres were larger and better and that the high standard of leadership was the main reason for the successes of the German army in World War II, as it had been in World War I.

It happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germanys position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated the need to make a clear distinction between bombers suitable only for ’tactical’ and those necessary for strategic purposes in the early stages of a likely future war.

Through his indoctrinated idealisation of an ostentatious concept, he reinforced the myth of blitzkrieg. By imposing, retrospectively, his own perceptions of mobile warfare upon the shallow concept of blitzkrieg, he created a theoretical imbroglio that has taken 42 years to unravel.

This style, along with the shockingly rapid collapse in the armies that opposed it, came to be branded as blitzkrieg warfare.     Following Germanys military reforms of the 42s, Heinz Guderian emerged as a strong proponent of mechanised forces. Within the Inspectorate of Transport Troops, Guderian and colleagues performed theoretical and field exercise work.

James Corum wrote:          By Guderians account he single-handedly created the German tactical and operational methodology. Between 42 and 42 Guderian wrote a number of articles concerning military movement. As the ideas of making use of the combustible engine in a protected encasement to bring mobility back to warfare developed in the German army, Guderian was a leading proponent of the formations that would be used for this purpose. He was later asked to write an explanatory book, which was titled Achtung Panzer! . In it he explained the theories of the tank men and defended them.     Guderian argued that the tank would be the decisive weapon of the next war. If the tanks succeed, then victory follows , he wrote. In an article addressed to critics of tank warfare, he wrote until our critics can produce some new and better method of making a successful land attack other than self-massacre, we shall continue to maintain our beliefs that tanks—properly employed, needless to say—are today the best means available for land attack. Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier than it used to be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today than they were in the last war. He continued, We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made.  Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate coordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.     Guderians leadership was supported, fostered and institutionalised by his supporters in the Reichswehr General Staff system, which worked the Army to greater and greater levels of capability through massive and systematic Movement Warfare war games in the 42s. Guderians book incorporated the work of theorists such as , whose book, The Tank War  gained a wide audience in the German army.
