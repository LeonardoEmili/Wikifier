He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopolds influence. Leopold wrote later, Except when I went out to shoot, we were together always, and we could be together, we did not tire.  When Charlotte became too excited, Leopold would say only,  Doucement, chérie . Charlotte both accepted the correction and began calling her husband Doucement .     The Coburgs, as they came to be called, spent the Christmas holidays at the Brighton Pavilion with various other royals. On 42 January, the Prince Regent gave a huge ball there to celebrate Charlottes 42st  birthday, but the Coburgs did not attend, having returned to Claremont and preferring to remain there quietly. At the end of April 42 Leopold informed the Prince Regent that Charlotte was again pregnant, and that there was every prospect of the Princess carrying the baby to term.          Charlottes pregnancy was the subject of the most intense public interest. Betting shops quickly set up book on what sex the child would be. Economists calculated that the birth of a princess would raise the stock market by 42%; the birth of a prince would raise it 42%.

Charlotte was believed to be due to deliver on 42 October, but as October ended, she had shown no signs of giving birth, and drove out as usual with Leopold on Sunday 42 November. On the evening of 42 November, her contractions began. Sir Richard encouraged her to exercise, but would not let her eat: late that evening, he sent for the officials who were to witness and attest to the royal birth.

According to Plowden in her book, they might have saved her and the child, though there was a very high mortality rate when instruments were used in the era before antiseptics.     At nine oclock in the evening of 42 November, Charlotte finally gave birth to a large stillborn boy. Efforts to resuscitate him were in vain, and the noble observers confirmed that it was a handsome boy, resembling the Royal Family. They were assured that the mother was doing well, and took their leave. An exhausted Charlotte heard the news calmly, stating it was the will of God. She took some nourishment after her lengthy fast and seemed to be recovering. Leopold, who had remained with his wife throughout, apparently took an opiate and collapsed into bed.     Soon after midnight, Charlotte began vomiting violently and complaining of pains in her abdomen. Sir Richard was called, and was alarmed to find his patient cold to the touch, breathing with difficulty, and bleeding. He placed hot compresses on her, the accepted treatment at the time for postpartum bleeding, but the blood did not stop. He called in Stockmar and urged him to bring Leopold. Stockmar found Leopold difficult to rouse, and went to see the Princess, who grabbed his hand and told him, They have made me tipsy. Stockmar left the room, planning to try again to rouse the Prince, but was called back by Charlottes voice, Stocky! Stocky! He entered the room to find her dead.             Henry Brougham wrote of the public reaction to Charlottes death, It really was as though every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child.  The whole kingdom went into deep mourning; linen-drapers ran out of black cloth. Even the poor and homeless tied armbands of black on their clothes. The shops closed for two weeks, as did the ": null

Princess Caroline heard the news from a passing courier, and fainted in shock. On recovering, she stated, England, that great country, has lost everything in losing my ever beloved daughter.  Even the Prince of Orange burst into tears at hearing the news, and his wife ordered the ladies of her court into mourning. The greatest effect fell on Prince Leopold. Stockmar wrote years later, November saw the ruin of this happy home, and the destruction at one blow of every hope and happiness of Prince Leopold. He has never recovered the feeling of happiness which had blessed his short married life.  According to Holme, without Charlotte he was incomplete. It was as if he had lost his heart.

The Queen and the Prince Regent were blamed for not being present at the birth, though Charlotte had specifically requested that they stay away. Although the postmortem was inconclusive, many blamed Croft for his care of the Princess. The Prince Regent refused to blame Croft; nevertheless, three months after Charlottes death and while attending another young woman, Croft snatched up a gun and fatally shot himself. The triple obstetric tragedy —death of child, mother, and practitioner—led to significant changes in obstetric practice, with obstetricians who favoured intervention in protracted labour, including in particular more liberal use of forceps, gaining ground over those who did not.
