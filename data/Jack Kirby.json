Different inkers would therefore impact on the published version of Kirbys art, with Kirby himself noting that individual inkers were suited to different genres. Interview, The Nostalgia Journal 30–1, November 1976–December 1976, reprinted in George, p. 10 For a period during the 1950s, when work had dried up, its been suggested by Harry Mendryk that Kirby inked himself.

Prior to 1967, art boards were around 14 x 21 inches, being reproduced at 7 x 10 inches. After 1967 the size of the board shrunk to 15 x 10. Hatfield & Saunders, p. 36-7 This affected the way Kirby drew. Gil Kane noted that the amount of space around the figures became less and less ... The figures became bigger and bigger, and they couldnt be contained by a single panel or even a single page . Hatfield & Saunders, p. 28 Professor Craig Fischer asserts Kirby at first hated the new size. Hatfield & Saunders, p. 37 Fischer argues that it took Kirby around 18 months to negotiate a way of working at the smaller size. Initially he retreated to a less detailed, close up style, as seen in  Fantastic Four  68. In adjusting to the new size, Kirby began utilising depth to bring the pages to life, increasing his use of foreshortening. By the time Kirby had moved to DC, he started to incorporate the use of two page spreads into his art more. These spreads helped define the mood of the story, and came to define Kirbys late era work.
