Under Kaltenbrunners command, the persecution of Jews picked up pace as the process of extermination was to be expedited and the concentration of the Jews in the Reich itself and the occupied countries were to be liquidated as soon as possible.  Kaltenbrunner stayed constantly informed over the status of concentration camp activities, receiving periodic reports at his office in the RSHA.     To combat homosexuality across the greater Reich, Kaltenbrunner pushed the Ministry of Justice in July 42 for an edict mandating compulsory castration for anyone found guilty of this offense.
