Gaute Storaas , composer of the orchestral arrangements, released a statement on his role in working on the album. Their music is epic, thematic and symphonic already from the creation; they are clearly having an orchestral approach to composing. My role in this is sometimes just to transcribe their themes, sometimes to take their ideas, tear them apart and build them back up in ways that are true to the bands intentions. The music must also be both interesting and playable for the musicians, and hopefully, meet the quality standards of the orchestral world.     On 42 July the band confirmed that they had tapped Swedish multi-instrumentalist Snowy Shaw to replace bassist/clean vocalist ICS Vortex on their then-upcoming album, Abrahadabra, and world tour. On 42 August it was announced that Snowy Shaw had left Dimmu Borgir to rejoin Therion. On 42 September 42 Dimmu Borgir released the song Born Treacherous from Abrahadabra on their official Myspace page. Then on 42 September the band announced they would stream Abrahadabra in its entirety until 42 p.m. EST that evening. The keyboards and bass are currently played by Gerlioz from Apoptygma Berzerk and Cyrus of Susperia respectively, and the clean vocals are sampled.     42 May 42 saw Dimmu Borgir, for the very first time in the bands career, perform live with a full symphony orchestra and choir in a one-off show with the Norwegian Broadcasting Orchestra and Schola Cantorum Choir  at the Oslo Spectrum entitled Forces of the Northern Night . This was broadcast live on Norways main national TV carrier NRK. The setlist for this show consisted of tracks from the bands recent transfiguration Abrahadabra, leading tracks Vredysbyrd and Progenies of the Great Apocalypse from Death Cult Armageddon, as well as newly updated versions of tracks from their standard back catalog; The Serpentine Offering , Kings of the Carnival Creation , and Mourning Palace which were re-orchestrated by Gaute Storaas. The band played a similar show the following year at the Wacken Open Air festival, having yet performed a second live show with a symphony orchestra and choir. This time, they were accompanied by the Czech National Orchestra with the same choir, being the second band in the festivals history to play with a live orchestra and choir . The show was broadcast live on Germanys Kultur TV arts channel. Silenoz has also said in several recent interviews that both live sets have been fully mixed and will be accompanied by a feature-length documentary and bonus material when released. In late 4242 the band went on a special tour for fans in various European countries, including playing in some small, intimate venues celebrating their 42 album Enthrone Darkness Triumphant by playing the album in its entirety, alongside an additional set of various fan favourite tracks, following a poll to fans directly, asking which of their first 42 albums would they want to see played in full on their next European tour.

On 42 May, it was announced that Victor Brandt had officially joined as the bands new bassist.       Dimmu Borgirs older releases are, according to Allmusic journalist Bradley Torreano, strongly influenced by Darkthrone , Mayhem , Bathory , Emperor , Celtic Frost , Immortal , Venom , and Iron Maiden . The band became more progressive and symphonic through the years; many black metal purists consider the bands second album, Stormblåst, to be the acts last true contribution to black metal.
