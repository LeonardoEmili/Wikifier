Edwards says of the actors mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, thats what Peter had become. He was certifiable.  With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a volatile and perplexing character left a trail of misery in his private life . He also noted that Sellers had a compulsive personality and an eccentric hypochondriac who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when he most needed the work.
