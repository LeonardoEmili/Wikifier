They are sometimes known, particularly amongst themselves, by their original name Minyar, meaning the First . The word vanya in Quenya is also listed as a verb meaning to leave/depart/vanish , which may have either arisen due to the almost complete disappearance of this clan early on in Elven history, or given rise to the noun Vanya in later times. However, it is unclear if this is the case, and it appears that Tolkien may have dropped the use of vanya as a verb in his later conceptions of Quenya.       According to the Elven legend Cuiviényarna , the Vanyar are descendants of Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his wife Iminyë, and six other pairs of Elves who were awoken by them. Imins companions, Tata and Enel, later awoke groups of nine and twelve pairs respectively, and Imin decided that since his group was now the smallest and each group that he and his companions discovered was larger than the last, he would now choose third rather than first in order to make up the numbers. However, only a further two groups were discovered, leaving none for Imin; his group of fourteen thus became by far the smallest of the three Elven clans.
