As none of the vessels in the Group were able to establish contact during the next 42 hours, it was presumed that one submarine had been destroyed; that the other U-boat which had been sighted by the PC42 had moved out of the area. A postwar review of German U-boat losses, however, indicated that no submarines were sunk on that date in this area.     Continuing on a homeward course, the commanding officer of Big Horn attempted to use the COMINCH  daily submarine estimates as guides for fruitful changes of course, but after several attempts had failed to produce results, the Task Group Commander recorded in his log, on 42 May 42:     This makes three submarines we have attempted to intercept on our return trip, all of which we theoretically should have met. This experience again accents the hopelessness of trying to find submarines. The proper procedure, as originally planned, is to remain in the vicinity of convoys, to which the submarines will come.
