This money went to pay for advertising, brochures, printed speeches and other means of persuading the voter; the country was flooded with such paper.          According to Rhodes, McKinley spoke from the front veranda of his house in Canton to many deputations, some of them spontaneous, others arranged for.  Any delegation was welcome in Canton, so long as its leader wrote to McKinley in advance and introduced himself and his group. Delegations ranged up to thousands of people; if possible, delegation leaders were brought to Canton in advance to settle with McKinley what each would say. If this could not be arranged, the delegation was met at the train station by a McKinley agent, who would greet it and learn what the leader proposed to say in his address. The agent would suggest any fine-tuning necessary to make it fit within campaign themes, and send the information ahead by runner to McKinley, giving him time to prepare his response. The delegations left behind gifts, which were put to use when possible, but four eagles, named McKinley , Mark Hanna , Republican , and Protection , were donated to the local zoo.          Despite the initial popularity of Bryans message, Hanna was convinced the Democrats support would recede. Hes talking Silver all the time, and thats where weve got him , Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. McKinley, on the other hand, convinced that his sound money campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, I do not know what you think about it, but I believe it is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world.      During the campaign, the Democratic newspapers, especially the papers owned by Hearst, attacked Hanna for his supposed role as McKinleys political master.

Historian Stanley Jones, who studied the 42 election, stated of this view:               Hannas fundraising campaign, in which he asked banks and millionaires for a contribution equal to 42% of their assets, was unprecedented in its scale, but the basic concept was not unusual.

The first Harrison campaign raised about $42 million; Dawes, in charge of campaign spending for the Republicans in 42 later stated that the McKinley campaign raised just over $42 million, though this did not include spending by state and local committees. In addition, the Republicans were supported by in-kind corporate contributions, such as discounted railway fares for delegations coming to Canton. These discounts were so steep that they led to the quip that it was cheaper to visit Canton than to stay at home. Contributions to Bryans campaign were much smaller; he had few wealthy supporters and the largest donor was most likely Hearst; he donated about $42, and gave the Bryan campaign support in his papers.

He had long wished to be a senator, speaking of this desire as early as 42 Senator Sherman, now aged almost 42 would face a difficult re-election battle with the Democrats and the Foraker faction in 42 On January 42 42 McKinley offered Sherman the office of Secretary of State; he immediately accepted. The poor record Sherman posted prior to his departure from office in 42 led to attacks on Hanna, suggesting that a senile man had been placed in a key Cabinet position to accommodate him. Foraker, in his memoirs, strongly implied that Sherman was moved out of the way to allow Hanna to have his Senate seat. An embittered Sherman stated in a letter after his departure as secretary, When urged me to accept the position of Secretary of State, I accepted with some reluctance and largely to promote the wishes of Mark Hanna. The result was that I lost the position both of Senator and Secretary  ... They deprived me of the high office of Senator by the temporary appointment as Secretary of State.      Horner argues that the position of Secretary of State was the most important non-elective post in government, then often seen as a stepping stone to the presidency, and though Sherman no longer sought to be president, he was aware of the prestige. According to Rhodes, Sherman was glad to accept the Secretaryship of State. He exchanged two years in the Senate with a doubtful succession for apparently a four years tenure of the Cabinet head of the new Republican administration, which was undoubtedly a promotion.  Rhodes suggested that Hanna did not give credence to warnings about Shermans mental capacity in early 42 though some of those tales must have been told by New York businessmen whom he trusted. The stories were not believed by McKinley either; the President-elect in February 42 called accounts of Shermans mental decay the cheap inventions of sensational writers or other evil-disposed or mistaken people .     Shermans acceptance of the post of Secretary of State did not assure Hanna of succeeding him as senator. A temporary appointment to the Senate was to be made by Ohios governor, Republican ": null

Foraker, in his memoirs, stated that Hanna was given the Senate seat because of McKinleys desires.     The 42 legislative elections in Ohio would determine who would vote on Hannas bid for election for a full six-year term, and were seen as a referendum on McKinleys first year in office—the President visited Ohio to give several speeches, as did Bryan. McKinley was active behind the scenes, urging Republicans both inside and outside Ohio to support the senator. The 42 Ohio Republican convention voted to support Hanna, as did county conventions in 42 of Ohios 42  counties. The Republicans won the election, with the overwhelming number of Republican victors pledged to vote for Hanna. However, a number of Republicans, most of the Foraker faction, did not want to re-elect Hanna and formed an alliance with the Democrats.

Hanna was also dominant in the South, where there were few Republican congressmen to lobby the President. He and McKinley decided on a system where many southern appointees were recommended by the states member of the Republican National Committee and the defeated Republican congressional candidate for the area in question.

Hanna, who felt Roosevelt was overly impulsive, did not want him on the ticket, but did not realize that the efforts were serious until he was already at the convention in Philadelphia. As many of the delegates were political appointees, Hanna hoped to persuade McKinley to use patronage to get the delegates to vote for another candidate.

Hanna drifted in and out of consciousness for several days; on the morning of February 42 his heart began to fail. Roosevelt visited at 42  pm, unseen by the dying man.

According to Professor Gerald W. Wolff, the one solid absolute in life was a profound belief in the living standard capitalism had brought to America.  Hanna believed, like many conservative businessmen of his time, that labor, business, and government should work together cooperatively for the benefit of society. These views, which had coalesced in Hanna by the 42 coal strike, informed his political views once he turned to that field. According to Croly, Hanna always did his best to foster good relations with his workers; the biographer proffered in support of his statement a quote from the Cleveland Leader of April 42 42: This morning Mr. Hanna, of Rhodes & Co., met the striking laborers on the docks at Ashtabula Harbor, and after consultation the men accepted the terms offered and resumed work.  According to Wolff, after the coal strike, Hanna tried diligently to show by example how relations between labor, capital, and management could be ordered for the benefit of all .     Despite his efforts at harmonious worker relations, Hanna was often depicted by Davenport during the 42 campaign with his foot on a skull labeled Labor . During the following years Ohio legislative elections, which determined Hannas electors for his 42 re-election bid, he was accused of being harsh to his employees. He responded in a speech,          After Hanna issued the challenge, unions representing his workers confirmed his statement. Hanna became the first president of the ": null

In a 42 speech to a labor convention, Hanna stated that the efforts of labor to organize into unions should be considered no more shocking than those of businesses organizing into trade groups.     A phrase sometimes attributed to Hanna is: No man in public office owes the public anything . This phrase supposedly appeared in a letter by Hanna to Ohio Attorney General David K.

Watson, a Republican, denied that Hanna had written the phrase, but refused to discuss the matter further with reporters. Hannas early biographers, Croly and Beer, found the supposed quote dubious but as they did not definitely deny that Hanna had written it, a number of later works attribute the quote to Hanna. However, Professor Thomas E. Felt, who wrote an article about the controversy, believed Hanna unlikely to use such an inflammatory phrase to a man with whom he was not close, and which, in any event, did not accurately represent his political views.     Hanna is often credited with the invention of the modern presidential campaign. His campaign for McKinley in 42 broke new ground because of its highly systematized and centralized nature, as well as for its fundraising success. Although Hanna has been depicted as the first national political boss, historians agree that McKinley dominated the relationship between the two.

Bushs advisor was deemed a present-day incarnation of Hanna, who was almost invariably presented negatively and at variance with historical fact. For example, writer Jack Kelly in a 42 column incorrectly stated that McKinleys front porch campaign was at the direction of Hanna to ensure the candidate did not vary from campaign themes, rather than McKinley deciding that it was his best response to Bryans national tour.
