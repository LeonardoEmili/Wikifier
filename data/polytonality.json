Here, then, we have a case of polytonality, but Bach has so adjusted his progressions that while the right hand is doubtless quite under the impression that the piece is in D minor, etc., and the left hand that it is in A minor, etc., the listener feels that the whole thing is homogeneous in key, though rather fluctuating from moment to moment. In other words, Bach is trying to make the best of both worlds—the homotonal one of his own day and the polytonal one of a couple of centuries .

Polyscalarity is defined as the simultaneous use of musical objects which clearly suggest different source-collections . Specifically in reference to Stravinskys music, Tymoczko uses the term polyscalarity out of deference to terminological sensibilities . In other words, the term is meant to avoid any implication that the listener can perceive two keys at once. Though Tymoczko believes that polytonality is perceivable, he believes polyscalarity is better suited to describe Stravinskys music. This term is also used as a response to Van den Toorns analysis against polytonality.

Some critics of the notion of polytonality, such as Pieter van den Toorn, argue that the octatonic scale accounts in concrete pitch-relational terms for the qualities of clashing , opposition , stasis , polarity , and superimposition found in Stravinskys music and, far from negating them, explains these qualities on a deeper level .
