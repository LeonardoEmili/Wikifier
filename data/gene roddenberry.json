Meyer described a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying: His guys were lined up on one side of the room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt Id behaved very well, very diplomatically. I came out of it feeling not very good, and Ive not felt good about it ever since.
