Meyer described a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying: His guys were lined up on one side of the room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt Id behaved very well, very diplomatically. I came out of it feeling not very good, and Ive not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didnt have to take him on. Not my finest hour.  In Joel Engels biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a good job .  In contrast, Nimoy and Shatners memoirs report that after the screening, Roddenberry called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.
