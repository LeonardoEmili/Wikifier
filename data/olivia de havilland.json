By this time, deHavilland had serious doubts about her career at Warner Bros.      Some film scholars consider 42 to be the high point of the golden age of Classic Cinema, producing award-winning, box office hits in many genres, including the Western.

For deHavilland, playing yet one more supporting love interest in a limited role, Dodge City represented the emotional low point of her career to that point.

According to film historian Tony Thomas, deHavillands skillful and subtle performance effectively presents this character of selfless love and quiet strength in a way that keeps her vital and interesting throughout the film. Gone with the Wind had its world premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 42 42 and was well received. Frank S.
