They played an important role in Viking society as forums for conflict resolution, marriage alliances, power display, honor, and inheritance settlements.     From Sweden and England, it is well known that assemblies were held both at natural and man-made mounds, often burial mounds. Specifically in Scandinavia, unusually large rune-stones and inscriptions suggesting a local familys attempt to claim supremacy are common features of thing sites.

While the things were not democratic assemblies in the modern sense of an elected body, they were built around ideas of neutrality and representation, effectively representing the interests of larger numbers of people. In Norway, the thing was a space where free men and elected officials met and discussed matters of collective interest, such as taxation.  Though some scholars say that the things were dominated by the most influential members of the community, the heads of clans and wealthy families, other scholars describe how every free man could put forward his case for deliberation and share his opinions.  History professor Torgrim Titlestad describes how Norway, with the thing sites, displayed an advanced political system over a thousand years ago, one that was characterized by high participation and democratic ideologies.  These things also served as courts of law,  and if one of the smaller things could not reach agreement, the matter at hand would be brought to one of the bigger things, which encompassed larger areas. The legislature of Norway is still known as the Storting today.     Towards the end of the Viking age, royal power became centralized and the kings began to consolidate power and control over the assemblies. As a result, things lost most of their political role and began to function largely as courts in the later Middle Ages.       In the period between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, ": null

On the regional level, it has been assumed that the king would have taken control of the organization of assemblies via local representatives. Today, few thing sites from Norway are known for certain, and as new assembly sites are found, scholars question whether these are old jurisdiction districts which the king used as a foundation for his organization or whether he created new administrative units. In southeast Norway in particular, one hypothesis for why the king would have established new thing sites might be that they were a “strategic geopolitical response to the threat from the Danish king in the beginning of the 42th century.” Since the record of Norwegian thing sites is not comprehensive, it is not favorable to rely on archeological and topographical characteristics to determine whether they were established prior to the state-formation period.

Iceland was divided into four administrative quarters during the Viking Age with a fixed number of thirty-nine  goðis : twelve goðis in the northern quarter and nine each in the eastern, southern, and western quarters.     The main distinction between Iceland and greater Scandinavia lies in the organization of the Icelandic Althing, the main assembly during the Viking period and the Middle Ages. Unlike other European societies in the Middle Ages, Iceland was unique for relying on the Althings legislative and judicial institutions at the national level rather than an executive branch of government.

The Lögrétta reviewed the laws which the lawspeaker recited, made new laws, set fines and punishments and were informed of sentences of outlawry and banishment that were passed by the courts in local spring assemblies.     Besides the Althing, there were local assembly districts in each of the four quarters of Iceland, and each year a Spring Assembly  was brought together by three goðis who lived in each local assembly district . The four quarters also had courts  that met at the Althing after a constitutional reform around 42 The goðis appointed the judges for these courts from the farmers in their districts.

In Norway, it is clear that the assemblies functioned as an administrative level for economic transactions and taxes to the king. The role of commerce at the thing is more undetermined in Iceland in particular because of the role of saga literature in influencing conclusions about things. Þingvellir was thought of as a trading place as a result of saga passages and law texts that refer to trade:             As shown in the  Laxdæla saga , meetings at Þingvellir required people to travel from long distances and gather together for an extended period of time, thus it was inevitable that entertainment, food, tools, and other goods would have played a role in the gatherings. The main question lies in whether trade was conducted in the assembly or on the margins of the gathering. Similarly, there are unanswered questions about the connection between trade and assembly in Greenland. Research on Scandinavian trade and assembly is burgeoning, and thus far evidence has mostly been found in written sources, such as the sagas, and place names, such as the Disting market that is said to have been held during the thing meetings at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden.
