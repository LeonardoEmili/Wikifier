        ": Bounded and boundary are distinct concepts; for the latter see boundary . A circle exists in a two dimensional space, the space may or may not be bounded but the circle can be described as a bounded set, while the half plane is a boundless line, and three unbounded lines.   In mathematical analysis and related areas of mathematics , a set is called bounded, if it is, in a certain sense, of finite size. A set which is not bounded is called unbounded. The word bounded topological space metric .       thu .   A set S of real number s is called bounded from above if there exists some real number k  such that k ≥  s for all s in S. The number k is called an upper bound of S. The terms bounded from below and lower bound are similarly defined.     A set S is bounded if it has both upper and lower bounds. Therefore, a set of real numbers is bounded if it is contained in a finite interval .         A subset S of a metric space  is bounded if it is contained in a ball of finite radius, i.e. if there exists x in M and r  r.  is a bounded metric space  if M is bounded as a subset of itself.     Total boundedness implies boundedness. For subsets of R n the two are equivalent.   A metric space is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.   A subset of Euclidean space R n is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.         In topological vector space s, a different definition for bounded sets exists which is sometimes called von Neumann bounded ness. If the topology of the topological vector space is induced by a metric which is homogeneous , as in the case of a metric induced by the norm of normed vector spaces , then the two definitions coincide.         A set of real numbers is bounded if and only if it has an upper and lower bound. This definition is extendable to subsets of any partially ordered set . Note that this more general concept of boundedness does not correspond to a notion of size .     A subset S of a partially ordered set P is called bounded above if there is an element k in P such that k ≥ s for all s in S. The element k is called an upper bound of S. The concepts of bounded below and lower bound are defined similarly.     A subset S of a partially ordered set P is called bounded if it has both an upper and a lower bound, or equivalently, if it is contained in an interval . Note that this is not just a property of the set S but also one of the set S as subset of P.     A bounded poset P is one that has a least element and a greatest element . Note that this concept of boundedness has nothing to do with finite size, and that a subset S of a bounded poset P with as order the restriction of the order on P is not necessarily a bounded poset.     A subset S of R n is bounded with respect to the Euclidean distance if and only if it bounded as subset of R n with the product order . However, S may be bounded as subset of R n with the ": null
