However, Nimoy said separately that the first offer he received from Roddenberry for Phase II was only for the pilot and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 42 episodes that followed, which he rejected.

He was excited and happy to see her, and immediately offered to bring back the character for Phase II, describing the removal of Rand from The Original Series as his greatest mistake and blaming it on NBC executives. He said that when Captain Kirk came back from having affairs with all these other women on all these other planets â€“ hed have to deal with What a great plot-thickener that would have been! .       Foster created a premise entitled In Thy Image , the basis of which was to see Earth threatened for the first time in Star Trek. Goodwin proposed that this story should be the pilot of Phase II at a meeting with Eisner on August 42 He would later recall that this specific meeting changed the direction of the franchise, as Eisner declared that Fosters story was the one that he had been looking for to make a feature, not a television, film. At the same time, Paramount had come to realise that the expected advertising revenues for the Paramount Television Service could not support a fourth network, and so there was no possibility of creating Phase II. By this point, the series had already spent $42, and the studio was looking to recoup those expenses in some manner. The initial idea was to continue with the pilot, and then attempt to sell the series to NBC, ": null

However, because of the number of times that a Star Trek film was announced in the 42s, the Paramount executives decided that they could not lose face once more by making an announcement, only to potentially reverse the decision in several months time. Because of this, production continued on Phase II for a further five months after the decision was made that it would not go into production. By November, Livingston and Roddenberry were no longer working well together. They had each re-drafted In Thy Image themselves, and presented these versions to Eisner. The Paramount executives response was that Roddenberrys version was suited for television, and Livingstons was better for a motion picture â€“ and better overall. Collins was assigned to combine certain elements of Roddenberrys version into Livingstons and to complete that draft by the end of the month.

In response, Paramount released a statement that said the new network had been pushed back to the fall of 42 and that Phase II had its episode order increased from 42 to between 42 and 42 Despite this, behind the scenes, production continued on Star Trek as a film, not as a series. One of the changes around the same time as Barretts reports was the realization that all the model work completed thus far had to be restarted from scratch, as it was not detailed enough to be blown up on a motion picture-sized screen. Two further changes took place in December: Collins was dropped as director, for Paramount wanted a motion picture director and not one with experience only in television; and Livingston allowed his contract to run out and left the production, owing to the poor relationship he had with Roddenberry. By January, Paramount no longer pretended that Star Trek was to be anything other than a feature film. Livingston was brought back, but only in a writing capacity, and ": null

After production was underway on The Motion Picture, and Nimoy signed up for the film, Gautreaux requested that Xon be eliminated from the script entirely instead of being shown in a reduced capacity. Gautreaux would go on to portray Commander Branch in the film instead, in his only appearance in the franchise. At the time of the production on the film, the idea was to keep Xon in reserve for a future film or television series.  Gautreaux was subsequently called in for an interview with Nimoy during the early work on  Star Trek III: The Search for Spock . The pair started talking about the impact that Nimoys return to Star Trek had made on Gautreaux, with the latter telling Nimoy that he had treated it as a play that had been cancelled on the first night of the performance, which had not made a major impact on his career.     The Phase II sets were located on stage 42 of the Paramount lot. The main layout and support features remained when those sets were overhauled to appear in The Motion Picture. Certain sets were re-designed over time to appear in various films within the franchise, but the main support structures stayed the same as designed for Phase II. The sets were re-worked and converted prior to the start of  Star Trek: The Next Generation  to appear on television for the first time, and when  Star Trek: Voyager  aired, they were used once more. It was only with the start of  Star Trek: Enterprise  that the setup of the Star Trek sets at Paramount were completely changed and the Phase II foundations no longer remained.      The idea of a young male Vulcan scientist was once again proposed early in the work on  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan , which was attributed by later reviewers to the influence of Xon from Phase II.
