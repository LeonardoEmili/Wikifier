A hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply, shifting the supply curve up, while a production cost discount would increase supply, shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases.     The concept of a supply curve assumes that firms are perfect competitors, having no influence over the market price. This is because each point on the supply curve ianswers the question If this firm is faced with this potential price, how much output will it be willing and able to sell? If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, and the firm is not faced with any fixed price, so the relevant model must become more complex.     Economists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve is the sum of the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price: individual firms supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.     Economists also distinguish the short-run and the long-run market supply curve. Here short run means a constant availability of one or more fixed inputs , and a fixed number of firms in the industry. In the long run, firms have a chance to adjust their producing capital, enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price. Furthermore, in the long run competitors can ": null

        ".     By its very nature, conceptualizing a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor—that is, that the purchaser has no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question If this buyer is faced with this potential price, how much of the product will it purchase? If a buyer has market power, so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price, then the buyer is not faced with any price, and the question is meaningless.     Like with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve. The market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price. Thus, in the graph of the demand curve, individuals demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.     The determinants of demand are:   Income.   Tastes and preferences.   Prices of related goods and services.   Consumers expectations about future prices and incomes that can be checked.   Number of potential consumers.

        " of such a shift traces the effects from the initial equilibrium to the new equilibrium.     Demand curve shifts:      When consumers increase the quantity demanded at a given price, it is referred to as an increase in demand. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve  to the new curve . In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from  to the higher . This raises the equilibrium quantity from  to the higher . The increase in demand has caused an increase in quantity. The increase in demand could come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute goods, market expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in movement along the supply curve from the point  to the point .     If the demand decreases, then the opposite happens: a shift of the curve to the left. If the demand starts at , and decreases to , the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The quantity supplied at each price is the same as before the demand shift, reflecting the fact that the supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different as a result of the change in demand.     Supply curve shifts:      When technological progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. For example, assume that someone invents a better way of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. Otherwise stated, producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve  outward, to —an increase in supply. This increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from  to . The equilibrium quantity increases from  to  as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. If the quantity supplied decreases, the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at , and shifts leftward to , the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed.     The movement of the supply curve in response to a change in a non-price determinant of supply is caused by a change in the y-intercept, the constant term of the supply equation. The supply curve shifts up and down the y axis as non-price determinants of demand change.          Partial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.
