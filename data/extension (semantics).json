Some concepts and expressions are such that they dont apply to objects individually, but rather serve to relate objects to objects. For example, the words before and after do not apply to objects individually—it makes no sense to say Jim is before or Jim is after —but to one thing in relation to another, as in The wedding is before the reception and The reception is after the wedding . Such relational or polyadic concepts and expressions have, for their extension, the set of all sequences of objects that satisfy the concept or expression in question.
