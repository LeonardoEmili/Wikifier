Thompson described the Ocampa as one of the more fascinating species introduced on Star Trek: Voyager, and wrote that Kes departure was one of the five things that hurt the show.     Kes romance with Neelix was the subject of criticism. Although the relationship was introduced in the pilot, Ruditis felt it was somewhat undefined as the series progressed . TrekMovie.com s Matt Wright panned the couple as borderline gross , and Thompson cited them as having the worst chemistry on the series. Thompson and Gizmodo s Tom Pritchard wrote that Kes would have benefited if Neelix was not included on the show. August criticized the frequency in which Kes storylines revolved around her love life. Kes relationship with other characters received a better response. Thompson praised Paris attraction for Kes as a good setup relationship to guide him into being a better and more responsible man for BElanna . August believed Tuvok and Kes could been an ideal couple if he was not already married.     Critics had a mostly negative response to Kes storyline for Elogium . Commentators questioned the plausibility of an Ocampa woman only giving birth once as it would cause an inevitable decrease in the species population. Jones & Parkin : p. 284 Writer David A.

McIntee : pp. 56-60 On the other hand, Bustle s Marie Southard Ospina praised the episodes depiction of a woman choosing to not have a baby without receiving judgement. Kes return for Fury also received negative feedback from reviewers who found her characterization to be disappointing. Den of Geek! s John Andrews likened the episode to a sad yet compelling character study , although he believed Kes shift in morality was not believable. August dislike the episodes version of Kes, describing it as a ham-fisted way of undermining her entire journey after leaving Voyager .       Kes relationship with Voyager s crew was the focus of academic discussion. Cultural studies scholar Debra Bonita Shaw wrote Janeway only accepts Kes, Neelix, and Seven of Nine as her subordinates; to gain Janeways acceptance, these characters must adhere to an established structure of command and help Voyager return home.

However, Dove-Viebahn clarified that Kes had agency through her mental abilities, which are portrayed as stronger than the crews scientific and medical technology.
