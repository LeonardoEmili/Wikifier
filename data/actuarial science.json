The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress.

        "s pioneering work on the long term insurance contracts under which the same premium is charged each year led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship  in London in 42 . Many other life insurance companies and pension funds were created over the following 42 years. Equitable Life was the first to use the word actuary for its chief executive officer in 42 . Previously, actuary meant an official who recorded the decisions, or acts , of ecclesiastical courts . Other companies that did not use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable .       In the 42th and 42th centuries, calculations were performed without computers. The calculations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex, and actuaries developed techniques to make the calculations as easy as possible, for example commutation functions . Actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by promoting competency and ethical standards . However, calculations remained cumbersome, and actuarial shortcuts were commonplace. Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life insurance colleagues during the 42th century.

In the late 42s and early 42s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models . Ideas from financial economics became increasingly influential in actuarial thinking, and actuarial science has started to embrace more sophisticated mathematical modelling of finance . Today, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory . However, assumption-dependent concepts are still widely used , particularly in North America.     Product design adds another dimension to the debate. Financial economists argue that pension benefits are bond-like and should not be funded with equity investments without reflecting the risks of not achieving expected returns. But some pension products do reflect the risks of unexpected returns. In some cases, the pension beneficiary assumes the risk, or the employer assumes the risk. The current debate now seems to be focusing on four principles:   financial models should be free of arbitrage   assets and liabilities with identical cash flows should have the same price.

There is an increasing trend to recognize that actuarial skills can be applied to a range of applications outside the traditional fields of insurance, pensions, etc. One notable example is the use in some US states of actuarial models to set criminal sentencing guidelines. These models attempt to predict the chance of re-offending according to rating factors which include the type of crime, age, educational background and ethnicity of the offender . However, these models have been open to criticism as providing justification for discrimination against specific ethnic groups by law enforcement personnel. Whether this is statistically correct or a self-fulfilling correlation remains under debate .     Another example is the use of actuarial models to assess the risk of sex offense recidivism. Actuarial models and associated tables, such as the MnSOST-R, Static42 and SORAG, have been used since the late 42s to determine the likelihood that a sex offender will re-offend and thus whether he or she should be institutionalized or set free ": null
