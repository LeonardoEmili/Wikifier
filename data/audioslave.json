The albums release date, however, was postponed to early September, and the band cancelled their previously announced European tour, to have a new album to support, when they embarked on touring. The first single off the album, Original Fire , was made available online on Audioslaves official website for free streaming in early July.     News about Cornells departure emerged in July 42 when insiders stated that after the third album was released, he would depart the band and restart his solo career. Cornell immediately denied the rumors, stating We hear rumors that Audioslave is breaking up all the time. ...

        " was released on September 42 42 The album entered the Billboard 42 at No.  42 and sold 42 copies during its first week of release. It became the bands least commercially successful album; dropping even faster than Out of Exile, its sales were down 42 percent the following week, achieving gold certification a month later. The album showed funk, soul and R & B influences that were non-existent for the band before; Morello referred to the new sound as Led Zeppelin meets Earth, Wind & Fire . Additionally, several songs took a more overtly political stance than previous Audioslave releases.     The album received a similar critical response to Out of Exile with the majority of reviewers praising the bands integrity on the record. The new funk and soul influences were also welcomed favorably; Allmusic called the album Audioslaves most colorful, diverse, and consistent record yet. Many others, however, saw it as just another rock record, and musically not much different from the previous album.     Cornell decided to delay the Revelations tour until 42 because he wanted to let the album come out and also concentrate on his second solo album. The rest of the band went along; Morello also revealed his plans to release his debut solo album in early 42 The second, and final single from the album, Revelations was released in October 42 with an accompanying music video a month later.     On January 42 42 Rage Against the Machine was announced to reunite for one show only, at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , on April 42 Less than a month later, on February 42 Cornell officially announced his departure from Audioslave, issuing this statement:   Due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences, I am permanently leaving the band Audioslave. I wish the other three members nothing but the best in all of their future endeavors. He stated that, as far as he was concerned, Audioslave had disbanded, and that a greatest hits collection would be issued in the future, because of label commitments.       Morello and Cornell initially disagreed over the particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: Tom and I did have communications about the fact that I was gonna go make a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it. He also added that this process of doing Audioslave business led him to go solo. Contrary to some reports, Cornell has stated that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We werent particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests werent as conjoined anymore.     In 42 Cornell revealed further information about the bands breakup; Personally a lot of it was me trying to land on my feet again. I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded...I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didnt need to become what it became. You learn with experience.     In 42 Morello said that unreleased material that was not on the three albums could be released in the future at an unspecified point. Cornell and Morello shared the stage together for the first time in seven years, among many musicians, at the 42 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concert. Cornell also joined Morello on stage on September 42 42 guesting on his solo Seattle show. They played together several Nightwatchman songs, Cornells usual acoustic covers, and for the first time in eight years, some Audioslave songs.     Both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden have reformed since Audioslaves breakup. Rage Against the Machine has performed at several live venues and other festivals since its initial performance at the Coachella Music Festival in April 42 although the band currently has no plans to make a new album.

        " that he was quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: I think it would be great. We did a lot of songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those guys for so long, I cant imagine what it would be. It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again. Soon after, Morello said that hes interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 42 Seattle performance with great fondness: I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. Hes one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And to be able to play the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again.       On January 42 42 it was announced that Audioslave would reunite for their first show in 42 years at Prophets of Rage s Anti-Inaugural Ball, protesting President Donald Trump s inauguration . The event took place on January 42 42     Asked in February 42 if there would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, Its always a possibility. I mean, weve been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about actually picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybodys so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career thats taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog . So, its really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where its comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybodys up for it.     However, on May 42 42 three months after making that statement, Cornell was found deceased in his Detroit hotel room, negating the possibility of any future Audioslave reunions with their original lead vocalist.

        " listed Audioslave among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 42 Universal fire .       The original idea for the bands name was Civilian, but it was dropped when members found out that it was already taken. Morello later discredited the story, contradicting Commerford and Cornell, and commented that Civilian was merely a rumor circulating at the time. He stated: The band has only ever had one name, and that is Audioslave. Morello described the origin of the Audioslave name to LAUNCHcast as follows:   That was Chris suggestion that sort of came to him in a vision. Were all on the two-way pagers, and Chris one night said, I got it. Its Audioslave. We were all, like, All right, fantastic. ... To paraphrase Elvis Costello , talking about band names is like dancing about architecture—theres just no point in it because the band name becomes the music and the people.     After the name was announced, it emerged that it was already being used by an unsigned band from Liverpool . The two bands worked out a settlement, with the American Audioslave paying $42 in a deal that allowed each band to use the name. To avoid confusion, the Liverpool band would rename themselves The Most Terrifying Thing.     The name was mocked by critics due to its uninspired nature, and was regarded as one of the worst in contemporary rock music, or even of all time. ": null

        " magazine chided it as one of the dumbest band names in recent rock history.       Audioslaves musical style has generally been regarded as hard rock , alternative metal , post-grunge , and alternative rock . By combining 42s style hard rock riffing with alternative rock, Audioslave created a distinctive sound. This mix was driven by Cornells wide vocal range, Morellos innovative guitar solos and the robust rhythm section of Wilk and Commerford. Morello, although stating he never felt musically limited in Rage Against the Machine, did say that he had a lot more scope to explore with Audioslave and a wider musical territory. This meant that the instrumentalists had the opportunity to write slow and melodic songs, something they had not done before.     As opposed to de la Rochas lyrics, Cornells were mostly apolitical; Morello referred to them as haunted, existential poetry. They were characterised by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of existentialism , love , hedonism , spirituality and Christianity . Audioslaves first two albums drew influences from 42s hard rock and heavy metal such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and from the members previous bands . For Revelations, which was influenced by 42s and 42s funk, soul and R & B music, Morello used vintage guitars and amplifiers and Cornell adopted his seventies funk and R & B-flavor vocals. The guitarist also cited Sly & the Family Stone , James Brown and Funkadelic as a reason for the funk overtones on the album.     Just as Rage Against the Machine did, Audioslave also included the statement All sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and vocals in their albums booklets as Morellos guitar work often caused listeners to believe that the band used samples , synthesiser effects or different turntable techniques to produce certain sounds.       All of Audioslaves lyrics were written by Cornell, while all four members—as a band—were credited with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as more collaborative and satisfying than Rage Against the Machines, which was a battle creatively. Cornell also felt the same way; he saw Soundgardens songwriting method inferior to Audioslaves. Rick Rubin, producer of the bands first two albums, was also lauded as a great collaborative partner and was likened to the fifth Beatle by Tom Morello. The time spent on songwriting by the band was always short. They wrote 42 songs in 42 days for the first album and exceeded that rate for the second album by having a song or sometimes two written every day. This method was adopted for the third album as well.     Cornells battle with drug addiction and alcoholism was a defining factor in the writing and recording process of the debut album. The singer admitted that he was never able to write effectively while drinking, and attended rehab after recording Audioslave. Although Morello stated that Revelations was the first record didnt smoke, drink or take drugs through the recording, he later clarified his statement by saying: Chris was stone sober during the making of our Out of Exile album. Chris was also sober during the making of Revelations and prior to recording he gave up smoking as well.       While Rage Against the Machines music was politically influenced, Audioslaves music was mostly not. Cornell stated he did not want to become the new singer of Rage Against the Machine or any political band, but he would play benefits the other band members wanted to play. Despite his reluctance to write political lyrics, he himself never discounted the possibility; he already touched upon political issues in Audioslaves Set It Off —a song inspired by 42s WTO riots —then later wrote an anti-war song, Sound of a Gun, and what Morello called the most political song Audioslaves ever written, Wide Awake for Revelations. Wide Awake was an attack on the Bush administration s perceived failures over the consequences of Hurricane Katrina .     The band was openly anti- Bush and against the Iraq War from the beginning; on March 42 42 only hours after President Bush announced plans to invade Iraq, the band performed live in Hollywood with messages reading How many Iraqis per gallon? and Somewhere in Texas, a Village is Missing an Idiot, scrolled across the stage. The music video for Doesnt Remind Me was also critical of the Iraq war. Wilk called Bush a fucking scam in an interview, criticizing the Bush administrations rationale for war in Iraq.     thu with Not in Our Name volunteers at an Axis of Justice tent at the July 42 42 Lollapalooza festival in Columbus, Ohio   During the time of the second albums release, several politically charged Rage Against the Machine songs resurfaced in Audioslaves live set. Although the members committed to not making political statements during their Cuba tour, Commerford stated in an interview that the concert made Audioslave more politically active than Rage Against the Machine ever was. While in Cuba, Cornell said that he takes every aspect of human life into consideration, when it comes to writing lyrics, and that he would write about the experience in a song, or more songs. This culminated in the political influences on Revelations, although he did not write about Cuba specifically. He asserted that he felt Audioslave can be a band like U42 , which is not overtly political, but Bono gets a lot done. That year, the band played at two more concerts organized to raise political awareness: Live 42 , which aimed to end global poverty, and the Hurricane Katrina benefit concert, ReAct Now: Music & Relief .     Audioslave was prominently involved in the Axis of Justice , a non-profit organization formed by Tom Morello and System of a Down s Serj Tankian to bring together musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice . Axis of Justice tents were set up at almost every Audioslave show, and with the exception of Commerford all band members appeared on the Concert Series Volume 42 CD/DVD charity album released in 42       Chris Cornell – lead vocals , acoustic guitar   Tom Morello – lead guitar   Tim Commerford – bass guitar , backing vocals   Brad Wilk – drums , percussion         Studio albums   ": null
