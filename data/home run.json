Once, while Kiner was trying futilely to place his hits, old Fritz Ostermueller came through with a sage observation. Ralph, he said, the right-hand batters who hit to right field are driving Fords. The right-hand batters who hit over the fence in left are driving Cadillacs. Kiner, by the way, is driving a Cadillac. Kiner, Ralph; Peary, Danny. . The New York Times. April 4, 2004.

That was actually first said by my Pirates teammate, pitcher Fritz Ostermueller.          In modern times a home run is most often scored when the ball is hit over the outfield wall between the foul poles  before it touches the ground , and without being caught or deflected back onto the field by a fielder.

Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases. This can only happen if the ball does not leave the ballfield.     In the early days of baseball, outfields were relatively much more spacious, reducing the likelihood of an over-the-fence home run, while increasing the likelihood of an inside-the-park home run, as a ball getting past an outfielder had more distance that it could roll before a fielder could track it down.     Modern outfields are much less spacious and more uniformly designed than in the games early days, therefore inside-the-park home runs are now a rarity. They usually occur when a fast runner hits the ball deep into the outfield and the ball bounces in an unexpected direction away from the nearest outfielder , the nearest outfielder is injured on the play and cannot get to the ball, or an outfielder misjudges the flight of the ball in a way that he cannot quickly recover from the mistake .

Home runs over the fence were rare, and only in ballparks where a fence was fairly close. Hitters were discouraged from trying to hit home runs, with the conventional wisdom being that if they tried to do so they would simply fly out. This was a serious concern in the 19th century, because in baseballs early days a ball caught after one bounce was still an out. The emphasis was on place-hitting and what is now called manufacturing runs or small ball .     The home runs place in baseball changed dramatically when the ": null

Further, the rules once stipulated that an over-the-fence home run in a sudden-victory situation would only count for as many bases as was necessary to force the winning run home. For example, if a team trailed by two runs with the bases loaded, and the batter hit a fair ball over the fence, it only counted as a triple, because the runner immediately ahead of him had technically already scored the game-winning run. That rule was changed in the 1920s as home runs became increasingly frequent and popular.

Ken Burns award-winning series,  Baseball , states that his actual total may have been as high as 950. Gibsons true total is not known, in part due to inconsistent record keeping in the Negro Leagues. The 1993 edition of the MacMillan Baseball Encyclopedia attempted to compile a set of Negro League records, and subsequent work has expanded on that effort. Those records demonstrate that Gibson and Ruth were of comparable power. The 1993 book had Gibson hitting 146 home runs in the 501 official Negro League games they were able to account for in his 17-year career, about 1 homer every 3.4 games. Babe Ruth, in 22 seasons , hit 714 in 2503 games, or 1 homer every 3.5 games. The large gap in the numbers for Gibson reflect the fact that Negro League clubs played relatively far fewer league games and many more barnstorming or exhibition games during the course of a season, than did the major league clubs of that era.
