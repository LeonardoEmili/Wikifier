The super-Poulet numbers below 42 are :              It is relatively easy to get super-Poulet numbers with 42 distinct prime divisors. If you find three Poulet numbers with three common prime factors, you get a super-Poulet number, as you built the product of the three prime factors.     Example:   42 42 42 is a Poulet number,   42 42 42 is a Poulet number,   42 42 42 is a Poulet number;     so 42 42 42 42 is a Poulet number too.
