The distinction between the exceptional and the normal became more and more blurred. As a result, there was a concomitant loosening of the synthetic bonds through which tones and harmonies had been related to one another. The connections between harmonies were uncertain even on the lowest chord-to-chord level. On higher levels, long-range harmonic relationships and implications became so tenuous, that they hardly functioned at all. At best, the felt probabilities of the style system had become obscure. At worst, they were approaching a uniformity, which provided few guides for either composition or listening.    The first phase, known as free atonality or free chromaticism , involved a conscious attempt to avoid traditional diatonic harmony.

One analyst concluded, following a minute examination of the Piano Variations, op. 42 that while the texture of this music may superficially resemble that of some serial music  ... its structure does not.
