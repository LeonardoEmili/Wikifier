        " provide a way to classify all of these irreducible subspaces.               The indistinguishability of particles has a profound effect on their statistical properties. To illustrate this, consider a system of N distinguishable, non-interacting particles. Once again, let n j denote the state of particle j. If the particles have the same physical properties, the n j s run over the same range of values. Let ε denote the ": null
