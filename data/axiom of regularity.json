Since w is disjoint from u, every element of w is ranked. Applying the axioms of replacement and union to combine the ranks of the elements of w, we get an ordinal rank for w, to wit \\textstyle \\operatorname \\cup \\ . This contradicts the conclusion that w is unranked. So the assumption that u was non-empty must be false and x must have rank.       Let X and Y be sets. Then apply the axiom of regularity to the set  . We see there must be an element of  which is also disjoint from it. It must be either X or Y. By the definition of disjoint then, we must have either Y is not an element of X or vice versa.       Let the non-empty set S be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, every element of S has a non-empty intersection with S. We define a binary relation R on S by aRb :\\Leftrightarrow b \\in S \\cap a , which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, there is some sequence  in S satisfying a n Ra n42  for all n in N. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such S exists.

So some of the power of comprehension was added back via the other existence axioms of ZF set theory which may be regarded as special cases of comprehension. So far, these axioms do not seem to lead to any contradiction. Subsequently, the axiom of choice and the axiom of regularity were added to exclude models with some undesirable properties.

If a theory is extended by adding an axiom or axioms, then any consequences of the original theory remain consequences of the extended theory. In particular, if ZF without regularity is extended by adding regularity to get ZF, then any contradiction which followed from the original theory would still follow in the extended theory.
