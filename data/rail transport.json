The process of modernization in the 19th century involved a transition from a spatially oriented world to a time oriented world. Exact time was essential, and everyone had to know what the time was, resulting in clocks towers for railway stations, clocks in public places, pocket watches for railway workers and for travelers. Trains left on time . By contrast, in the premodern era, passenger ships left when the captain had enough passengers. In the premodern era, local time was set at noon, when the sun was at its highest. Every place east to west had a different time and that changed with the introduction of standard time zones.

Most trackage was single track, with sidings and signals to allow lower priority trains to be sidetracked. Schedules told everyone what to do, where to be, and exactly when. If bad weather disrupted the system, telegraphers relayed immediate corrections and updates throughout the system. Just as railways as business organizations created the standards and models for modern big business, so too the railway timetable was adapted to myriad uses, such as schedules for buses ferries, and airplanes, for radio and television programs, for school schedules, for factory time clocks. The modern world was ruled by the clock and the timetable. Tony Judt, When the Facts Change: Essays 1995–2010 pp. 287–288.       According to historian ": null

The generation between 1865 and 1895 was already mortgaged to the railways, and no one knew it better than the generation itself.    The impact can be examined through five aspects: shipping, finance, management, careers, and popular reaction.          Industry comes of age: Business, labor, and public policy, 1860–1897 pp. 52, 68–74.   Funding came from financiers throughout the Northeast, and from Europe, especially Britain.  About 10 percent of the funding came from the government, especially in the form of land grants that could be realized when a certain amount of trackage was opened. Kirkland, Industry comes of age pp. 57–68. The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds. New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market. The British invested heavily in railroads around the world, but nowhere more so than the United States; The total came to about $3 billion by 1914. In 1914–1917, they liquidated their American assets to pay for war supplies.  Saul Engelbourg, The man who found the money: John Stewart Kennedy and the financing of the western railroads .

The construction of the first railway of the Austro-Hungarian empire, from Vienna to Prague, came in 1837-1842 to promises of new prosperity. Construction proved more costly than anticipated, and it brought in less revenue because local industry did not have a national market. In town after town the arrival of railway angered the locals because of the noise, smell, and pollution caused by the trains and the damage to homes and the surrounding land caused by the engines soot and fiery embers. Almost all travel was local; ordinary people seldom had need of passenger trains. Chad Bryant, Into an Uncertain Future: Railroads and Vormärz Liberalism in Brno, Vienna, and Prague.
