The event is decided and the winning outcome is determined to be Outcome 4 with $110.00 wagered. The payout is now calculated. First the commission or take for the wagering company is deducted from the pool. For example, with a commission rate of 14.25% the calculation is: $1028 × 0.1425 $146.49. This leaves a remaining amount of $881.51. This remaining amount in the pool is now distributed to those who wagered on Outcome 4: $881.51 / $110.00 8.01 ≈ $8 per $1 wagered. This payout includes the $1 wagered plus an additional $7 profit. Thus, the odds on Outcome 4 are 7-to-1 .     Prior to the event, betting agencies will often provide approximates for what will be paid out for a given outcome should no more bets be accepted at the current time.

In horse racing, a practical example of this circumstance might be when an overwhelming favorite wins. The parimutuel calculation results might call for a very small winning payout , but the legal regulation would require a larger payout . In North America, this condition is usually referred to as a minus pool.

A trifecta box with three numbers has six possible permutations and costs six times the betting base amount. A trifecta box with five numbers has 60 possible permutations and costs 60 times the betting base amount . In France, a box gives only the ordered permutations going along an ordered list of numbers such that a trifecta box with six numbers would cost 20 times the base amount.   Any2 or Duet: The bettor must pick the two horses who will place first, second or third but can finish in any order. This could be thought of as a double horse show key .   Hi 5 or Super 5: The bettor must pick five horses finishing in the exact order. Typically does not occur unless there are 8 or more horses in a race.     ; Multiple races     Double: the bettor must pick the winners of two successive races ; most race tracks in Canada and the United States take double wagers on the first two races on the program  and on the last two .   Triple: the bettor must pick the winners of three successive races; like doubles, many tracks offer running or rolling triples. Also called pick three or more commonly, a treble.   Quadrella or Quaddie: The bettor must pick the winners of four nominated races at the same track.   Pick six or Sweep six: Traditionally, the bettor must pick the winners of six consecutive races. However, there are variants ranging from three to nine races, with a four-race bet known as a Pick Four. Exclusively for the pick six, a progressive jackpot is sponsored by the host track and available at its satellite locations which grows until someone picks six winners correctly. There is also a consolation prize for those who pick five winners correctly, divided amongst the number of tickets registered in the system with five out of six right, in a case where nobody gets five or six winners, a four out of six consolation prize may occur. A Place Pick Nine makes up for the increased difficulty of the high number of races by allowing a second-place finish for a bettors selected horse to count as a win.   Jackpot: A twist on the traditional Pick 6 or Hi 5 bet is one where the progressive jackpot is paid only if there is one winning bet. In this case, the consolation prize is given to the multiple holders of the winning bets with the jackpot growing until there is one winner. If there is no winner when the racing season ends, a mandatory payout occurs typically on the last racing day where the jackpot is paid out to whoever has a winning bet.     Win, place and show wagers class as straight bets, and the remaining wagers as exotic bets. Bettors usually make multiple wagers on exotic bets. A box consists of a multiple wager in which bettors bet all possible combinations of a group of horses in the same race. A key involves making a multiple wager with a single horse in one race bet in one position with all possible combinations of other selected horses in a single race. A wheel consists of betting all horses in one race of a bet involving two or more races. For example, a 1-all daily double wheel bets the 1-horse in the first race with every horse in the second.     People making straight bets commonly employ the strategy of an each way bet. Here the bettor picks a horse and bets it will win, and makes an additional bet that it will show, so that theoretically if the horse runs third it will at least pay back the two bets. The Canadian and American equivalent is the bet across : the bettor bets equal sums on the horse to win, place, and show.     A ": null

In events with five to seven runners, no dividends are payable on third place and in events with 4 or fewer runners, only Win betting is allowed.    Each-Way : A combination of Win and Place. A $5 bet Each-way is a $5.00 bet to Win and a $5.00 bet to Place, for a total bet cost of $10.   Exacta: The bettor must correctly pick the two runners which finish first and second.

Daily Double : The bettor must pick the winners of two nominated races at the same track.    Treble : The bettor must pick the winners of three nominated races at the same track. This bet type is only available in the states of Queensland and South Australia.   Quadrella or Quaddie: The bettor must pick the winners of four nominated races at the same track.   Big 6: The bettor must pick the winners of six nominated races, which can be at the same track or split over two or more tracks.     In Australia, certain exotic bet types can be laid as flexi bets. Usually the price of an exotic bet is determined by a set multiple of the outcome, for example $60 for a five horse boxed trifecta at one unit —or $30 at half unit . If the bet is successful, the bettor will get either the full winning amount shown on the board, or half the winning amount. Under a flexi system the bettor can nominate their desired total wager, and their percentage of payout is determined by this wagers relationship to the full unit price. Using a five horse box trifecta, the bettor may wish to lay only $20 on the outcome. Their percentage of winnings is now calculated as $20/$60 33.3%. If the bet is successful, the payout will be 33.3% of the winning amount for a full unit bet.     In recent times the Roving Banker variant for ": null

This bet also includes subsidiary wagers on smaller combinations of the chosen horses; for example, if only two of the four horses win, the bettor still collects for their double. A Trixie requires trying to pick three winners, and a Canadian or Super Yankee trying to pick five; these also include subsidiary bets.
