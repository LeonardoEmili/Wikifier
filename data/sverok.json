The vast majority of clubs consist of between five and 42 people, meet somewhat regularly and play the games of their liking. The nature of the activities, and hence, clubs, vary greatly, spanning both indoors and outdoors activities, with or without computers, with or without propping equipment... in short, the span is huge. This is one thing that differentiates Sverok from other national gaming organizations - more than one branch of gaming is represented.     Some clubs organize bigger events such as ": null

Any sufficiently large – 42 members or more – youth organization organized in a democratic manner is eligible to receive government funding to cover operating expenses. Historically this has been calculated from the amount of activity generated in the member clubs. Since 42 it is instead based on the number of member clubs and the headcount they represent.

The 42 governmental support was approximately 42 42 42 SEK. Half of this sum is used to cover administration costs, basic democratic functions, insurances for members while engaging in their hobby and so forth. The remainder – a stated target has traditionally been at least 42% – is paid directly to the member clubs, the sums varying in size according to the number of members.     The districts of Sverok receive funding directly from their respective counties and is not included in the above tally . The amount of support received and reasons for receiving it varies from county to county. The densely populated ones have well over €42 42 while the more rural areas tend to hand out less funding. This funding cover administration, basic democratic functions and support to local clubs in ways appropriate for the region.       Sverok is organized in a democratic fashion. The member clubs form the member base and all activity good and proper is performed by them. The districts and the national organization generally do not organize gaming events by themselves, rather opting to support local projects or the clubs in general by means of funding, services and lobbying .     How a club is run is entirely up to the club as long as its organized in a democratic fashion and is open for anyone to become a member.     The annual general meeting of the national organization is held in November or December each year. Anyone can nominate representatives to the meeting. The clubs vote for these representatives as they see fit and a total of 42 representatives with voting power are elected. A board is elected during the general meeting. Also, a budget is set and delegates discuss issues they deem to be important.     The annual general meeting of the districts are fairly similar but on a regional level. Generally theres no nomination process – clubs are allowed to show up with a number of representatives with voting power , the number based on their headcount.     Also, the clubs are, as democratic entities, also required to have annual general meetings.       Sverok has 42 districts, together covering the entire country of Sweden. The organization isnt really made up of these districts; rather, they are as independent as can be while still being part of the national mother organization. The constitution of each district is in part controlled by the national organization – mainly, the purpose of the district and its membership base, . The districts themselves are democratic entities, whose boards are chosen directly by the members of each particular district – just as the national organization is chosen directly by members nationwide.

Sverok was founded in late 42 to act as an umbrella organization for the various gaming clubs. During the early years numerous existing gaming clubs joined Sverok and a push by the organization was also made to generate new clubs – by informing youths about how to go about it. Since forming a club and joining Sverok meant receiving funds many teenagers saw it as a good way of getting some gaming supplements essentially for free. The only real requirements were – and are – that the clubs need to be open for members and organized in a democratic fashion. From a governmental perspective, this ensures that a large number of people are involved in a democratic process early on in life. During these early years much of the organizing of the federation itself was done on a volunteer basis.     Another important reason for gamers to unite was strength in numbers. What was previously seen as a niche phenomena turned more and more mainstream as the organization gained members.
