The pharmacokinetics of the chosen anti-malarial are key; the decision of choosing a long half-life over a drug that is metabolised quickly is complex and still remains unclear. Drugs with shorter half-lifes require more frequent administration to maintain the correct plasma concentrations, therefore potentially presenting more problems if levels of adherence and compliance are unreliable, but longer-lasting drugs can increase the development of resistance due to prolonged periods of low drug concentration.   The pharmacokinetics of anti-malarials is important when using combination therapy. Mismatched drug combinations, for example having an unprotected period where one drug dominates can seriously increase the likelihood of selection for resistant parasites.   Ecologically there is a linkage between the level of transmission and the development of resistance, however at present this still remains unclear.

This is a serious concern, as the rate at which new drugs are produced by no means matches the rate of the development of resistance. In addition, the most newly developed therapeutics tend to be the most expensive and are required in the largest quantities by some of the poorest areas of the world. Therefore, it is apparent that the degree to which malaria can be controlled depends on the careful use of the current drugs to limit, insofar as it is possible, any further development of resistance.     Provisions essential to this process include the delivery of fast primary care where staff are well trained and supported with the necessary supplies for efficient treatment.

The most successful attempts so far have been in the administration of combination therapy. This can be defined as, the simultaneous use of two or more blood schizonticidal drugs with independent modes of action and different biochemical targets in the parasite.  There is much evidence to support the use of combination therapies, some of which has been discussed previously, however several problems prevent the wide use in the areas where its use is most advisable. These include: problems identifying the most suitable drug for different epidemiological situations, the expense of combined therapy , how soon the programmes should be introduced and problems linked with policy implementation and issues of compliance.     The combinations of drugs currently prescribed can be divided into two categories: non-artemesinin-based combinations and artemesinin based combinations. It is also important to distinguish fixed-dose combination therapies from combinations achieved by taking two separate antimalarials.              According to WHO guidelines 42 artemisinin-based combination therapies should be used in preference to amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.       Artemesinin has a very different mode of action than conventional anti-malarials , which makes it particularly useful in the treatment of resistant infections. However, to prevent the development of resistance to this drug it is only recommended in combination with another non-artemesinin based therapy. It produces a very rapid reduction in the parasite biomass with an associated reduction in clinical symptoms and is known to cause a reduction in the transmission of gametocytes thus decreasing the potential for the spread of resistant alleles. At present there is no known resistance to Artemesinin  and very few reported side-effects to drug usage, however this data is limited.
