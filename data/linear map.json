It is convenient to represent these numbers in a rectangular array of  rows and  columns, called an  by  matrix:   : \\begin   a_ & a_ & \\ldots & a_ \\\\   a_ & a_ & \\ldots & a_ \\\\   \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\   a_ & a_ & \\ldots & a_   \\end     Observe that the coordinates a_ of the vector A_j appear in the j th column of . The vectors A_j are therefore sometimes called the column vectors of . With this terminology, the range of  is spanned by the column vectors of .   This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if A is a real  matrix, then  describes a linear map  .     Let  be a basis for V. Then every vector v in V is uniquely determined by the coefficients c 1 , …, c n in the field R:     : c_1 \\mathbf_1 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf_n.     If  is a linear map,     : f\\left c_1 f\\left + \\cdots + c_n f\\left,     which implies that the function f is entirely determined by the vectors f, …, f. Now let  be a basis for W. Then we can represent each vector f as     : f\\left a_ \\mathbf_1 + \\cdots + a_ \\mathbf_m.     Thus, the function f is entirely determined by the values of a ij . If we put these values into an  matrix M, then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of f for any vector in V. To get M, every column j of M is a vector     : \\begin a_ & \\cdots & a_ \\end^\\textsf     corresponding to f as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column j that corresponds to the mapping f,     : \\mathbf \\begin   \\ \\cdots & a_ & \\cdots\\ \\\\   & \\vdots & \\\\   & a_ &   \\end     where M is the matrix of f. In other words, every column  has a corresponding vector f whose coordinates a 1j , …, a mj are the elements of column j. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.

The dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space W/f is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.

The kernel may be expressed as the subspace   0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element.

Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.       For a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define index as:     : \\operatorname : \\dim - \\dim,     namely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.     For a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim − dim, by rank–nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.
