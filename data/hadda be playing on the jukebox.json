Police violence, student revolt and corporations, for example, had been previously touched on in his 42 Thoughts on a Breath , and conspiracies surrounding the state security apparatus would be explored in 42 in Birdbrain! . That same year, in Capitol Air , he would compare Americas Attica with Russias Lubyanka wall . Ginsbergs own view on both his political poems and the events they describe was occasionally critical. In Indian Journals, he wrote I shouldnt waste my time on America like this. It may be patriotic / but it isnt good art .       The poem frames various events of the 42s and 42s, including the ": null
