With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both one-to-one and onto .     Bijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail , as in f : X ⤖ Y.

Property says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.       In a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:   Every student was in a seat ,   No student was in more than one seat,   Every seat had someone sitting there , and   No seat had more than one student in it.   The instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.       For any set X, the ": null
