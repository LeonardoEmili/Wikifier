On the other hand, the genus does not characterize the complex structure. For example, there are uncountably many non-isomorphic compact Riemann surfaces of genus 42 .       Non-compact surfaces are more difficult to classify. As a simple example, a non-compact surface can be obtained by puncturing a closed manifold.
