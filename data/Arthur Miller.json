Monroe was taking drugs to help her sleep and more drugs to help her wake up, which caused her to arrive on the set late and then have trouble remembering her lines. Huston was unaware that Miller and Monroe were having problems in their private life. He recalled later, I was impertinent enough to say to Arthur that to allow her to take drugs of any kind was criminal and utterly irresponsible. Shortly after that I realized that she wouldnt listen to Arthur at all; he had no say over her actions. Grobel, Lawrence. The Hustons, Charles Scribners Sons, New York p. 489     Shortly before the films premiere in 1961, Miller and Monroe divorced after their five years of marriage. Nineteen months later, August 4, 1962, Monroe died of a likely drug overdose. Huston, who had also directed her in her first major role in  The Asphalt Jungle  in 1950, and who had seen her rise to stardom, put the blame for her death on her doctors as opposed to the stresses of being a star: The girl was an addict of sleeping pills and she was made so by the God-damn doctors.

Miller maintained that family relationships and families must be immersed in social context. Lenke Németh,   Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies , Arthur Millers The Ride Down Mount Morgan and the Family-Play Tradition , Vol. 11, No. 2, Representations of the Family in Modern English-Language Drama In Memory of Arthur Miller , pp. 77–88       Miller is known for the consciousness of the characters in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in  All My Sons  and John Proctor in  The Crucible . Popkin, Henry, Arthur Miller: The Strange Encounter, The Sewanee Review, Vol. 68, No. 1 , pp. 34-60 Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.         Millers determination to deal with the eternal themes of life, death and human purpose is one of his most prominent themes across his works. This theme spans from Willy Lomans dedication to providing for his family and his inherent belief that his death would leave a legacy, to John Proctors willingness to die to preserve his name. Nearly all of Millers protagonists struggle with the mark they leave on life and what it means to die. Broderick, Bridget and Stein, Jean, ″Contemporary Literary Criticism″, eds. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale, 1983. 617 pp.           In Death of a Salesman – originally entitled The Inside of His Head – Miller brilliantly solves the problem of revealing his main characters inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. Arthur Miller, The Pulitzer Prices, pulitzerprize.org Death of a Salesman seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.     Willy Loman desperately wants to believe that he has succeeded, that he is “well liked” as a great salesman, a fine father, and a devoted husband. That he has not really attracted the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him from the beginning of the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.       Eddie Carbone is the central character in  A View from the Bridge  and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antagonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small world that he operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement with one of his Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Millers examples of tragic figures.

He is a faithful farmer who lives by a strict moral code that he violates by succumbing to an affair with a young girl, Abigail, who serves in his home. After Proctor rejects her, Abigail spitefully accuses Johns wife of witchcraft, involving him in a string of affairs that challenge his beliefs and convictions. In his attempts to save his wife, he is convicted of witchcraft as well, and will only be acquitted if he confesses to his crime and signs his name to a piece of paper.

McGill, William Jr. The Crucible of History: Millers John Proctor The New England Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 2 , pp. 258–64       Critics have long admired the playwrights suspenseful handling of the Keller familys burden in the play  All My Sons . The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake because it would have driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority. Joes irresponsibility is exposed through his sons questioning of his very humanity. Joes suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play.       ": null
