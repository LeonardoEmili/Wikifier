While they were performing this task, they were given supreme political power , whereas the power of the magistrates was restricted. In 450 BC, the decemviri produced the laws on ten tablets , but these laws were regarded as unsatisfactory by the plebeians. A second decemvirate is said to have added two further tablets in 449 BC. The new Law of the Twelve Tables was approved by the peoples assembly.     Modern scholars tend to challenge the accuracy of Roman historians. They generally do not believe that a second decemvirate ever took place. The decemvirate of 451 is believed to have included the most controversial points of customary law, and to have assumed the leading functions in Rome. Furthermore, the question on the Greek influence found in the early Roman Law is still much discussed.

In fact, the results of his rulings enjoyed legal protection  and were in effect often the source of new legal rules. A Praetors successor was not bound by the edicts of his predecessor; however, he did take rules from edicts of his predecessor that had proved to be useful. In this way a constant content was created that proceeded from edict to edict .     Thus, over the course of time, parallel to the civil law and supplementing and correcting it, a new body of praetoric law emerged. In fact, praetoric law was so defined by the famous Roman jurist Papinian : Ius praetorium est quod praetores introduxerunt adiuvandi vel supplendi vel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia propter utilitatem publicam . Ultimately, civil law and praetoric law were fused in the  Corpus Juris Civilis .          The first 250 years of the current era are the period during which Roman law and Roman legal science reached its greatest degree of sophistication. The law of this period is often referred to as the classical period of Roman law. The literary and practical achievements of the jurists of this period gave Roman law its unique shape.     The jurists worked in different functions: They gave legal opinions at the request of private parties.

In practice, the two differed by the means of their creation and not necessarily whether or not they were written down. The ius scriptum was the body of statute laws made by the legislature. The laws were known as leges and plebiscita . Roman lawyers would also include in the ius scriptum the edicts of magistrates , the advice of the Senate , the responses and thoughts of jurists , and the proclamations and beliefs of the emperor . Ius non-scriptum was the body of common laws that arose from customary practice and had become binding over time.    ius commune and ius singulare  – Ius singulare is special law for certain groups of people, things, or legal relations , unlike general, ordinary, law . An example of this is the law about wills written by people in the military during a campaign, which are exempt of the solemnities generally required for citizens when writing wills in normal circumstances.    ius publicum and ius privatum  – ius publicum means public law and ius privatum means private law, where public law is to protect the interests of the Roman state while private law should protect individuals.

Public law will only include some areas of private law close to the end of the Roman state. Ius publicum was also used to describe obligatory legal regulations . These are regulations that cannot be changed or excluded by party agreement. Those regulations that can be changed are called today ius dispositivum, and they are not used when party shares something and are in contrary.

        ", therefore was only available to Roman citizens.          To describe a persons position in the legal system, Romans mostly used the expression togeus. The individual could have been a Roman citizen  unlike foreigners, or he could have been free  unlike slaves, or he could have had a certain position in a Roman family  either as the head of the family , or some lower member—alieni iuris—which lives by someone elses law. Two status types were senator and emperor.          The history of Roman Law can be divided into three systems of procedure: that of legis actiones, the formulary system, and cognitio extra ordinem. The periods in which these systems were in use overlapped one another and did not have definitive breaks, but it can be stated that the legis actio system prevailed from the time of the XII Tables until about the end of the 2nd century BC, that the formulary procedure was primarily used from the last century of the Republic until the end of the classical period , and that of cognitio extra ordinem was in use in post-classical times. Again, these dates are meant as a tool to help understand the types of procedure in use, not as a rigid boundary where one system stopped and another began.      During the republic and until the bureaucratization of Roman judicial procedure, the judge was usually a private person . He had to be a Roman male citizen. The parties could agree on a judge, or they could appoint one from a list, called album iudicum. They went down the list until they found a judge agreeable to both parties, or if none could be found they had to take the last one on the list.     No one had a legal obligation to judge a case. The judge had great latitude in the way he conducted the litigation. He considered all the evidence and ruled in the way that seemed just. Because the judge was not a jurist or a legal technician, he often consulted a jurist about the technical aspects of the case, but he was not bound by the jurists reply. At the end of the litigation, if things were not clear to him, he could refuse to give a judgment, by swearing that it wasnt clear. Also, there was a maximum time to issue a judgment, which depended on some technical issues .     Later on, with the bureaucratization, this procedure disappeared, and was substituted by the so-called extra ordinem procedure, also known as cognitory. The whole case was reviewed before a magistrate, in a single phase. The magistrate had obligation to judge and to issue a decision, and the decision could be appealed to a higher magistrate.                   When the centre of the Empire was moved to the ": null

The students who were taught Roman law in Bologna found that many rules of Roman law were better suited to regulate complex economic transactions than were the customary rules, which were applicable throughout Europe. For this reason, Roman law, or at least some provisions borrowed from it, began to be re-introduced into legal practice, centuries after the end of the Roman empire. This process was actively supported by many kings and princes who employed university-trained jurists as counselors and court officials and sought to benefit from rules like the famous Princeps legibus solutus est .     There are several reasons that Roman law was favored in the Middle Ages. Roman law regulated the legal protection of property and the equality of legal subjects and their wills, and it prescribed the possibility that the legal subjects could dispose their property through testament.
