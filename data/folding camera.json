The use of folding cameras declined in the late 42s with advances in lens technology allowing superior enlargement, high quality images on smaller negatives, and shorter distances between the lens and the film. 42mm film made small-sized cameras practical without using bellows. Lens technology allowed 42/42 cameras to use shorter focal distances, and the twin lens reflex cameras became popular.
