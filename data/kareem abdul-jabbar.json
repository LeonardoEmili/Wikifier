When asked about being Muslim, he said: I dont have any misgiving about my faith. Im very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world. That is not what Islam is about, and that should not be what people think of when they think about Muslims. But its up to all of us to do something about all of it. NPR interview with Michel Martin , November 1, 2015.     In November 2014, Abdul-Jabbar published an essay in Jacobin magazine calling for just compensation for college athletes , writing, in the name of fairness, we must bring an end to the indentured servitude of college athletes and start paying them what they are worth.     In 2007, Abdul-Jabbar participated in the national UCLA alumni commercial entitled My Big UCLA Moment . The UCLA commercial is featured on YouTube.     On February 10, 2011, Abdul-Jabbar debuted his film On the Shoulders of Giants, documenting the tumultuous journey of the famed yet often-overlooked Harlem Renaissance professional basketball team, at Science Park High School in Newark, New Jersey . The event was simulcast live throughout the school, city, and state.     Commenting on Donald Trumps 2017 travel ban, he strongly condemned it, saying, The absence of reason and compassion is the very definition of pure evil because it is a rejection of our sacred values, distilled from millennia of struggle.           thu and Abdul-Jabbar, 2012   In January 2012, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that Abdul-Jabbar had accepted a position as a cultural ambassador for the United States.

So its nice to be following in his footsteps. . U.S. Department of State. January 18, 2012. As part of this role, Abdul-Jabbar has traveled to Brazil to promote education for local youths.

Abdul-Jabbar purchased and donated 7700 16th Street NW , a house in Washington, D.C., for Khaalis to use as the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center. Eventually, Kareem found that disagreed with some of Hamaas teachings about the Quran, and parted ways.     Abdul-Jabbar has spoken about the thinking that was behind his name change when he converted to Islam. He stated that he was latching on to something that was part of my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba , and their culture survived slavery ...   My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And thats a terrible burden on black people, because they dont have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted.     In 1998, Abdul-Jabbar reached a settlement after he sued Miami Dolphins running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar because he felt Karim was sponging off the name he made famous by having the Abdul-Jabbar moniker and number 33 on his Dolphins jersey. As a result, the younger Abdul-Jabbar had to change his jersey nameplate to simply Abdul while playing for the Dolphins. The football player had also been an athlete at UCLA.

In November 2009, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he was suffering from a form of leukemia , Philadelphia chromosome -positive chronic myeloid leukemia , a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The disease was diagnosed in December 2008, but Abdul-Jabbar said his condition could be managed by taking oral medication daily, seeing his specialist every other month and having his blood analyzed regularly. He expressed in a 2009 press conference that he did not believe that the illness would stop him from leading a normal life. Abdul-Jabbar is now a spokesman for Novartis , the company that produces his cancer medication, Gleevec .     In February 2011, Abdul-Jabbar announced via Twitter that his leukemia was gone and he was 100% cancer free . A few days later, he clarified his misstatement.
