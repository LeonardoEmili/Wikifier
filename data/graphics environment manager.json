        ".  An exclusive look inside Tramiels Atari - by Jeffrey Daniels - START VOL. 42 NO. 42 / SUMMER 42 / PAGE 42     As Atari had provided most of the development of the 42 version, they were given full rights to continued developments without needing to reverse-license it back to DRI. As a result, the Apple-DRI lawsuit did not apply to the Atari versions of GEM, and they were allowed to keep a more Mac-like UI.     Over the next seven years, from 42 to 42 new versions of TOS were released with each new generation of the ST line. Updates included support for more colors and higher resolutions in the raster-side of the system, but remained generally similar to the original in terms of GKS support.

        ".       The full GEM system consisted of three main parts:     GEM VDI   GEM AES   GEM Desktop     GEM VDI was the core graphics system of the overall GEM engine. It was responsible for low level drawing in the form of draw line from here to here . VDI included a resolution and coordinate independent set of vector drawing instructions which were called from applications through a fairly simple interface. TVDI also included environment information , current color, line thickness, output device, etc.     These commands were then examined by GDOS, whose task it was to send the commands to the proper driver for actual rendering. For instance, if a particular GEM VDI environment was connected to the screen, the VDI instructions were then routed to the screen driver for drawing. Simply changing the environment to point to the printer was all that was needed to print, dramatically reducing the developer workload . GDOS was also responsible for loading up the drivers and any requested fonts when GEM was first loaded.     One major advantage VDI provided over the Macintosh was the way multiple devices and contexts were handled. In the Mac such information was stored in memory inside the application. This resulted in serious problems when attempting to make the Mac handle pre-emptive multitasking, as the drawing layer  needed to have direct memory access into all programs. In GEM VDI however, such information was stored in the device itself, with GDOS creating virtual devices for every context & ndash; each window for instance.     GEM AES provided the window system, window manager, UI style and other GUI elements . For performance reasons, many of the GUI widgets were actually drawn using character graphics. Compared to the Macintosh, AES provided a rather spartan look and the system shipped with a single monospaced font.     AES performs its operations by calling the VDI, but in a more general sense the two parts of GEM were often completely separated in applications. Applications typically called AES commands to set up a new window, with the rest of the application using VDI calls to actually draw into that window.     GEM Desktop was an application program that used AES to provide a file manager and launcher, the traditional desktop environment that users had come to expect from the Macintosh. Unlike the Macintosh, the GEM Desktop was based on top of DOS ": null
