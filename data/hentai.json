Eroge games in particular combine three favored media—cartoons, pornography and gaming—into an experience. The hentai genre engages a wide audience that expands yearly, and desires better quality and storylines, or works which push the creative envelope.  Nobuhiro Komiya, a manga censorship worker, states that the unusual and extreme depictions in hentai are not about perversion so much as they are an example of the profit-oriented industry.  Anime depicting normal sexual situations enjoy less market success than those that break social norms, such as sex at schools or bondage.     According to clinical psychologist Megha Hazuria Gorem, Because toons are a kind of final fantasy, you can make the person look the way you want him or her to look. Every fetish can be fulfilled.  Sexologist Narayan Reddy noted of eroge games, Animators make new games because there is a demand for them, and because they depict things that the gamers do not have the courage to do in real life, or that might just be illegal, these games are an outlet for suppressed desire.       The hentai genre can be divided into numerous subgenres, the broadest of which encompasses heterosexual and homosexual acts.
