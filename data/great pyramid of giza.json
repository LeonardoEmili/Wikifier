Nevertheless, a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen to this day  in situ  around the base of the Great Pyramid, and display the same workmanship and precision that has been reported for centuries. Petrie also found a different orientation in the core and in the casing measuring 193  centimetres ± 25 centimetres. He suggested a redetermination of north was made after the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was built with a different orientation. Petrie related the precision of the casing stones as to being equal to opticians work of the present day, but on a scale of acres and to place such stones in exact contact would be careful work; but to do so with cement in the joints seems almost impossible .  It has been suggested it was the mortar that made this seemingly impossible task possible, providing a level bed, which enabled the masons to set the stones exactly.

The original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north,  vertically above ground level and  east of the center line of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a Descending Passage 0 high and  wide, which goes down at an angle of 26° 3123 through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it. After , the passage becomes level and continues for an additional  to the lower Chamber, which appears not to have been finished. There is a continuation of the horizontal passage in the south wall of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists suggest that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.       from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of the Descending Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this is the beginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending Passage is  long, as wide and high as the Descending Passage and slopes up at almost precisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery. The lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of granite, each about  long. One must use the Robbers Tunnel to access the Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft which follows an irregular path through the masonry of the pyramid to join the Descending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the Horizontal Passage leading to the Queens Chamber . The passage is 1.1m high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage is  high.

The horizontal distance was cut in 1872 by a British engineer, Waynman Dixon, who believed a shaft similar to those in the Kings Chamber must also exist. He was proved right, but because the shafts are not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the Queens Chamber, their purpose is unknown.

It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in the ceiling of the Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending Passage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden.

There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated.

In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived, Lehner suggested the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby quarries.

The entire process, including conservation and straightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years.     The result is a cedar-wood boat  long, its timbers held together by ropes, which is currently housed in a special boat-shaped, air-conditioned museum beside the pyramid. During construction of this museum, which stands above the boat pit, a second sealed boat pit was discovered. It was deliberately left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the boat.
