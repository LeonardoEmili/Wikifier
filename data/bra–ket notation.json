It is common to use the same symbol for labels and constants in the same equation.

While  is traditionally associated with wavefunctions,  may be used to denote a label, a wave function or complex constant in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.     The main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector  is scaled by , it might be denoted by , which makes no sense since  is a label, not a function or a number, so you cant perform operations on it.     This is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved outside the designed slot, e.g. . Here part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2.
