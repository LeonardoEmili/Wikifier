Depending on the definition of element being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed.

        " in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we hear music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book Psychology of Music, Seashore, C. E. . Psychology of music: New York: Dover Publications. identified four psychological attributes of sound . These were: pitch, loudness, time, and timbre . He did not call them the elements of music but referred to them as elemental components . Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: Pitch and timbre match exactly, loudness links with dynamics and time links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase the elements of music links more closely with Websters New 20th Century Dictionary definition of an element as: a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods Webster, N. Websters New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company. and educational institutions lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.     Although writers of lists of rudimentary elements of music can vary their lists depending on their personal priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.
