Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish.     In the 42 book  42: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus , journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date sometime before 42 BC, and possibly before 42 BC as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico.

Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 42 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 42/ 42 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo . La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.     The Olmec civilization ended in 42 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 4242 BC.
