By virtue of his relationship with Bill Gillespie, the white police chief, fostered during a previous murder investigation in which he assisted, Tibbs is persuaded by the mayor to remain in Sparta as Chief of Detectives. Mayor Findlay himself has an ulterior motive for hiring Tibbs: he wants to have some kind of record on civil rights in order to run for Congress, and hiring Tibbs to integrate the Sparta police department would help to overcome the local squads reputation of being racist and underskilled—and it also benefits him. Although the team suffers friction over Tibbs dissatisfaction with the departments limited resources and racial attitudes, and Gillespie is annoyed at the detectives condescending suspicions about his home town, the two men prove highly effective in enforcing the law.

A humorous episode about a polygamist with an equally healthy appetite for food as well as women ends up dead, suspected to be poisoned by one of his many wives.

Two feuding sisters  stir up trouble when they are implicated in their fathers murder. All hell breaks loose when Virgil and Althea integrate an all-white church by request of a progressive minister, but not all the congregants are happy with his decision, and the minister ends up dead. Joannes past comes back to haunt her in the form of a vicious escaped convict.

A bitter strike leads to murder, but not all is as it seems when a new manager takes over Thail River Mill and drives the union to strike after only three months.

Dugan was appointed acting chief by Councilwoman White, but he was actually working undercover for the FBI in an attempt to stop the assassination of a civil rights preacher during a visit to the town by a white supremacist group. The season finale Missing has the chief being kidnapped upon his return to Sparta by two men in pig masks, and the police and the FBI are at wits end trying to locate him and those who are responsible. OConnor wanted the chief to undergo heart surgery in the storyline, but the husband and wife producers came up with this storyline instead.

She had an uneasy relationship with him from the outset and it culminated in the attack. Althea and Virgil are frustrated trying to bring the rapist to justice because the new district attorney Gerard Darnelle  doesnt have enough evidence to prosecute the teacher. Althea was blindfolded during the attack, so she didnt see him but she recognized his voice, and the teachers wife always provides him with an alibi. However, after being thoroughly excoriated by Gillespie for her complicity, she finally comes forward and implicates him. The teacher invaded Virgil and Altheas home during this and attempted to assault her again, but Althea bravely fought him off and he was subsequently arrested.     The second part of the Season 42 finale, Missing , is resumed in Episode 42 entitled Anniversary - a decision made by OConnor that the network was not pleased with because the episodes were not shown in chronological order. The Season 42 cliffhanger was Gillespie being kidnapped and Dugan murdered and when the show returned, it was as if none of that ever happened. OConnor selected the Rape episode to kick off the new season instead because he thought it was more powerful, and it would attract higher viewer ratings.     The character of Joanne St. John was eliminated to make room for Councilwoman Harriet DeLong  as Chief Gillespies future love interest, first as a recurring character, then later, a main cast member. An attractive, much younger African-American divorcée, DeLong was college-educated, outspoken, and brimming with attitude, which was a turn off to Gillespie at first and the two of them did not get along.     In First Girl , Gillespie hires Christine Rankin, Sparta PDs first female officer. Her life is tragically cut short her first day on duty in a shootout with a drug dealer and murder suspect, causing Gillespie much despair and guilt.

LuAnns hiring opened the door for more women police officers to join the force: Officer Dee Shepard  is hired later in the season.     In other plotlines, Parker almost crosses the line between police ethics and love when he falls for dance teacher Kate Morell and her daughter Jaycee; a former boxer that used to run for the mob tries to blackmail them. The chief tries unsuccessfully to save him, telling Althea, The FBI wants to buy what King Baylor knows before the mob kills him and the mob wants him dead before the FBI can buy him. Althea Tibbs takes an interest in two orphaned kids, whose parents were murdered the same day; Bubba becomes the object of two brothers revenge when he shoots down their other brother during a robbery. It was also revealed during a Christmas-themed episode that season that Parker served two years in Vietnam and was held as a prisoner of war there. Sweet attempts to save a young girl addicted to crack, but her father isnt convinced that crack is a problem for a small town like Sparta. A young boy, whose father played football with Bubba in high school, witnesses his fathers murder and is so traumatized that he cant speak to identify the killer. A reverend is found to have led a double life after he is slain. There is a murder at a nursing home, and racial tensions nearly reach a boiling point in town when a white man is robbed and killed in The Bottoms, and a black man visiting a relative in Sparta is the prime suspect. The case puts Gillespie and Tibbs at odds with one another. An unexpected visit from Altheas high school girlfriend from Philadelphia has a hidden motive. There is an almost instant attraction between her and young Officer Sweet, but the secrets shes brought along with her contribute to bringing things to an ill-fated end.     In the two-part season finale, Citizen Trundel , Harriet DeLongs sister Natalie is murdered by order of her secret lover and the married father of her nine-year-old son, millionaire businessman V.J. Vidge Trundel. The situation causes Harriet a tremendous amount of anguish, rage, and frustration, not only because of Natalies murder but because Chief Gillespie is reluctant to pursue the powerful Trundel as a suspect. That causes conflict between Harriet and Gillespie, because Gillespie and Detective Tibbs are not able to implicate Trundel in the crime, much less charge him for it. They are only able to arrest Natalies assassin, who miraculously is released on bail - but is later killed himself. However, Harriet wants Trundel himself apprehended, but Gillespie refuses to act upon it, which infuriates her and she tries to get Gillespie removed from the case. In Part Two, it is discovered that Norman Luft and Jessica Franks, two of Trundels most trusted employees, facilitated not only Natalies murder — but also the murder of the man they hired to kill her. Jessica is arrested, and Luft is apprehended attempting to leave Sparta by private plane with Trundel. Gillespie confronts Trundel with the knowledge that even though he has escaped a murder charge, he will still have to live with the burden of having his lover and the mother of his son, Eric DeLong, murdered and having to live with the risk that Eric would one day confront him over it. Prior to this, Trundels wife finds out about the boy from Gillespie and Tibbs, and after that, everything seems to fall apart. Unable to bear the weight of his guilt, Trundel commits suicide by deliberately crashing his plane only minutes after taking off. These are the first episodes in which we see Bill and Harriets relationship begin to gel. During this period, he is able to see beyond her hardened exterior and finds a vulnerable and sensitive woman behind it; she discovers his compassionate side. From this point on, a camaraderie is formed between the two.     This story arc was of special significance to series costar Denise Nicholas, who played Harriet DeLong. Ten years before, her real-life sister had been murdered and the culprit had never been caught. When Carroll OConnor approached Denise about the storyline, it had upset her greatly and she had to write him a note explaining the situation.

Carroll OConnor threatened to sue a tabloid which published a story saying that MGM and Carroll had fired Rollins for being absent from the set due to his problems.

While Althea is waiting to go into labor, Tibbs friend and ex-colleague from the Philadelphia P.D. is found dead, and its at first labeled as a suicide. Tibbs heads up to the big city to attend his funeral, only to learn his friends death was not by his own hand, but murder. Tibbs soon recognizes there is corruption going on within the police department, and his friend was framed for the murder of a drug dealer. In the process of trying to clear his friends name, he first becomes a target, then framed for murder himself. Chief Gillespie travels to Philly to get Virgil out of jail, help him solve the mystery of what happened to his friend and seek justice for him, expose the corrupt officers and make it back home to Sparta in time for the twins birth. William and Sarah Tibbs were welcomed into the world on September 42 42     Other stories include a visit from Altheas parents; Virgils Aunt Etta moves in to help care for the twins; a heartbreaking episode about a mild-mannered teacher being accused of child molestation by a neglected student; and a remorseful parolees recent discharge from prison upsets many in Sparta. In Family Matters , Virgils cousin is a suspect in a string of robberies. Virgil promises his Aunt Ruda that he wants to bring the family back together again and that her son Tyrell will not get hurt. When the boy ends up shooting himself while fighting with Virgil for the gun used in the robberies, Ruda angrily cuts herself off from the rest of the family. There is a Christmas clip show, a show about a bounty hunter, a storyline in which the Sparta P.D. has to save a wrongly convicted man from death row; Bubba rekindles a romance with an old high school flame who is now a widow, and will do anything to hang on to the wealthy life she married into; Parker falls for a witness who is blind, and finding the source of some spiked moonshine. Bubba goes to Los Angeles to extradite a Sparta resident responsible for a fire that killed two people, which was actually one of two backdoor pilots for a series that featured Alan Autry, but neither of them were picked up by the network.     Harriet DeLongs ex-husband Vic Glendon returns to Sparta plotting to rob his former employer in a revenge scheme . On a misty Sunday morning, three men break into the Lambry Industries plant with the intent to steal the payroll waiting to be paid out on Monday morning. They succeed, but a security guard is shot and killed in the process. Two of the men, one of them Glendon, are apprehended by Parker and Sweet. The other gets away and in the confusion, Sweet sustains a gunshot wound to his leg. Harriet is worried about how the news will affect her 42-year-old son, Eugene, who is a track star at Sparta High. The case brings her and Bill closer together, while it drives a wedge between her and Eugene. Eugene, who is observant of the friendship between his mother and the chief, reminds his mother that Aunt Natalie was killed by a white man , while Bill brushes off the boys not-so-foolish notions about him and his mama for now. He tries to remain neutral in this case, as he doesnt want to appear to have a personal stake in what happens to Vic. Virgil, on the other hand, isnt fooled and can see that there is an unmistakable but unspoken attraction between Bill and Harriet. Later Eugene, who is aware of what his father and his friends plans were, tries to help out the guy who escaped but nearly loses his life behind it and ends up in the hospital.     Towards the end of the season, Vic Glendon goes on trial as the main conspirator of the robbery and murder of the security guard at the Lambry plant . The story is retold in flashbacks. The suspect that got away is later found and shot down by Virgil when the suspect fires at him. Later the third man, who was shot during the robbery, dies from his gunshot wound, leaving Vic to take sole responsibility for what has happened. Harriet is uncertain of the position she is supposed to take in all of this. After quick deliberation by the jury, Vic is found guilty on all charges and is sentenced to death by lethal injection. He is later imprisoned at Parchman. Eugene, overwhelmed by everything happening to his father, loses hope for a normal life and wants to give up on everything and leave Sparta. Virgil and Sergeant Jamison, who has been mentoring Eugene, both try to convince him that he can still achieve his goals for the future in spite of what is going on. With Lonnie vouching for the boy, he ends up on parole for being in possession of some of the stolen Lambry money and being an accessory after the fact to the robbery.     The season closes with Althea upset over the stress of Virgils job on the police force after he is almost killed by a stray bullet which he does not tell her about. She is worried that her children will grow up without their father. She begs him to try something different. Chief Gillespie burns up the wires to get Virgil on his way to law school, and Althea apologizes for not being more understanding as she, Virgil, and Chief Gillespie share a glass of non-alcoholic champagne together.       The fifth season begins with the revelation that Chief Gillespie has a 42-year-old daughter by the name of Lana Farren, played by ": null

        ". Lana was conceived during a period where her mother was separated from her husband, and she and Gillespie had an affair. However, she was never divorced from her husband, Ken Farren. Georgia asks Bill to help her put some of her affairs in order and to keep all of her boyfriends as well as her estranged spouse away from her assets, which she intends to leave to Lana. Bill immediately puts Ted Marcus on the case to assist Lana in obtaining the property meant to be given to her by her mother. In the meantime, Georgia returns to Gulfport and is murdered. The chief, who still cared about Georgia, is devastated and takes this very personally. He sets out to find her killer, who turns out to be Ken, who has returned to Sparta. He evidently learns that Bill Gillespie is Lanas real father, which is his motive for the murder. While the Sparta P.D. tails Ken, Gillespie tries to get to know the daughter that he never met. By the end of the episode, Lana figures out who Bill really is, but does not want to have anything to do with him because he never took responsibility or attempted to have a relationship with her while she was growing up. This hurts Bill deeply, and he has a hard time dealing with it.     Season 42 sees the return of Virgils Aunt Ruda in Rudas Awakening . Ruda is the only witness to a struggle that ends in the death of a young robbery suspect, and Bubba is blamed. D.A. Darnelle wants to prosecute, but only Ruda can clear Bubba since the young man shot himself in the struggle, the same way Tyrell Gibson, her son, did. Her prejudice against the police and against Virgil clouds her memory of the incident. But after visiting Tyrell in prison, whereupon he tells her that the shooting that left him wheelchair-bound was not Virgils fault, her memory of the incident returns, and the episode ends with Virgil and Ruda happily reconciled.     In the episode The More Things Change , Gillespie and Harriet share their first kiss after he drives her home after attending a party, and he finally reveals his affections for her. They both lament the very likely possibility that a relationship between the two of them would not be accepted by most in Sparta. Their time alone together is initially interrupted by Harriets son, Eugene, who harbors a deep dislike for the Chief, whom he blames for his fathers imprisonment, and doesnt want him around his mother. In Moseleys Lot , one brother plots the death of his irresponsible alcoholic and compulsive gambling younger brother after two thugs from New Orleans follow him home to Sparta, looking for repayment for debts owed to a gangster.     Other storylines include a taxidermist who is obsessed with a flirtatious schoolteacher; a game of high-stakes poker that ends in murder; D.A. Darnelles daughter is kidnapped; Bubbas finding out that Sheriff McCombs deputy is growing pot on the side; Altheas preoccupation with a college-bound student whose unstable mother is dating a drug dealer causes division between her and Virgil; Sweet is determined to discover the truth about the murder of his grandfather in 42 and those responsible for it  and the widow of V.J. Trundel returns, trying to get custody of the son that her husband had with Harriets murdered sister, who has been living with his aunt since the murder occurred. The recap of the Season 42 season finale, Citizen Trundel , is shown in flashbacks.

He asked her to write a script, which she did. When she submitted it to him, he liked it so much that he encouraged her to write others for the series.      In the two-part season finale Sanctuary and The Law on Trial , Sheriff McComb has Gillespie and Tibbs brought up on obstruction charges and harboring a fugitive after an escaped prisoner, who is an El Salvadoran immigrant seeking asylum, is given sanctuary in a monastery and the two dont arrest him when he refuses to give himself up. The prisoner is later shot to death in a standoff with the sheriffs department. Althea fears that if Virgil is convicted, it will be the end of his career as a cop and will hinder his chances of being an attorney. Judge Sims presides over the case, and a reluctant D.A. Darnelle has to prosecute his two friends. Ted Marcus represents Gillespie and Tibbs in the trial, and Father DiMarco , the abbot who harbored the fugitive, represents himself at trial. Father DiMarcos heartfelt summation to the jury contributes to the case being dismissed . In between court appearances, Harriet pays Gillespie an inconspicuous visit and the two share a tender and romantic moment.     The conflict between Sheriff McComb and Chief Gillespie lingers on throughout the following season, and that conflict affects every crossover dealing with subsequent interactions between McCombs deputies and Gillespies officers. It isnt until the arrival of Chief Hampton Forbes  in Season 42 that we see Sheriff McComb and Chief Gillespie as friends again.

NBC had decided not to renew the series, although the ratings were still respectable and there were still some open ended plots that hadnt been resolved. A deal was made with rival network CBS to keep the show on the air. Originally, CBS opted to pick up the series for only a set of six two-hour movies. However, it was eventually picked up for a full 42-episode order.     The first two episodes of the season see the secret romance between Gillespie and DeLong intensify. They frequently meet in a studio apartment that doubles as Harriets art studio. Their relationship is temporarily interrupted by a crack war involving Eugene Glendon, Harriets son. Eugene witnesses the death of his best friend and a small-time Sparta drug dealer in a drive-by shooting by other dealers from Jackson. Virgil and Lonnie are frustrated with Eugenes refusal to cooperate. Later on, he decides to comply with the police as a witness after seeing so many of his peers affected by whats going on. However, Harriet is strongly against it, which causes friction between her and Bill. She is frightened for the life of her son, but Bill tries to assure her that Eugene will be protected. Harriet is not convinced and in her fear and frustration, she decides to put distance between herself and Bill for a while. He is hurt, but he honors her wishes and agrees to take a step back.     Althea Tibbs witnesses the gruesome suicide of an obsessive and emotionally disturbed student, Garth Watkins , causing her to suffer a near mental breakdown in a two part episode. Virgils Aunt Ruda is in the hospital, fighting cancer. Virgil worries about her safety when several terminally ill patients who share the same physician as Ruda end up dying before their time, and murder is suspected.     Other highlights this season included a visit from LuAnns ex-convict brother , a faded country music singer  who ends up committing murder; the reconciliation between Gillespie and his estranged daughter Lana; Bubbas being stalked by an obsessed admirer; Sweets falsely accused of soliciting a bribe by two racist used car salesmen; a law school classmate of Virgils is suspected of foul play when an ex-girlfriend of his is found dead in a river.

They first made offers to buy it, but when Lana refuses, they try more desperate measures to drive her out by attempting to set the house on fire so that they can build the Sparta South Development , a huge shopping/upscale housing development that would be the ruin of the small business establishments in Sparta.

Season 42 opens with Bill Gillespie being forced out of office and former Memphis, Tennessee Police Department Inspector Hampton Forbes  is hired as the new police chief by the city council. After nearly three decades on the Sparta police force, Gillespie does not receive a new contract from the council because his romance with Harriet is now out in the open, although other excuses are made for his dismissal. He seems to be accepting of the outcome, while Harriet doesnt hesitate to show her fury over the decision. The transition from Gillespie being in charge to Forbes taking over is slightly uneasy at the very start, but soon things smooth out. However, Gillespie is soon appointed as the acting Sheriff of Newton County when Nathan McComb suffers a heart attack and is too ill to continue his duties. This new appointment for Gillespie angers several on the city council. They want an investigation, which is upsetting and hurtful for Harriet. Gillespie also buys a new home, which he recruits Harriet to decorate in hopes she will move in with him, but she is hesitant.     Gillespies last case as Sparta police chief is the finding the murderer of an unstable local man - whom he learns is a nine-year-old boy who the man had threatened for repeatedly trespassing on his property. The child shot him with his mothers gun. It is suggested that the boy was influenced by a story he had been following on the news of another child who had killed someone.     As Acting Sheriff, his first case is to solve the murders and robbery of one of the richest families in Sparta — the Barrons, and their housekeeper. Wade Hatton  is a former lawyer from New Orleans who has returned to his native Sparta to revisit his childhood memories for a book he plans on writing, and to romance attorney Sarah Hallisey.

Gillespie, Forbes, and the Sparta P.D. work together to capture and bring the real killer to justice, although District Attorney Darnelle, who feels the mentally disabled youth is the real guilty party and is being treated in a privileged status due to his handicap, wants to prosecute. Hatton declines to represent young Henry because he lost a similar case years ago and his client was executed. He, however, does agree to represent the real killer of the Barrons - if he testifies in court that Henry didnt participate in the killings, he was just on the premises when it happened and didnt comprehend the difference between what was real and what was make-believe. Sarah Hallisey agrees to represent Henry in court.     Other cases involve a friend of Bubba Skinners being given the AIDS virus from a lover who knew he had it, a nine-year-old little girl being killed because of a drunk driver , a young interracial couple being stalked by a white supremacist . Other cases include Parkers being accused of police brutality, and the return of Parkers stepfather, Roy Eversole  and his lady friend Miss Roda . Gillespie must once again confront his racist past when a new synagogue moves into Sparta and the rabbi  detests Gillespie for being anti-Semitic back in the 42s. This both shocks and angers Harriet, who is friendly with the rabbi. LuAnn experiences maternal feelings when she temporarily cares for an abandoned infant she finds in a crack house. Lana Farren also makes one final appearance as Bills daughter in the Hagman-directed episode A Love Lost , in which he must protect her from a former boyfriend who is involved in a gun-running scheme with someone in Sparta. Bubba goes to Atlanta to look after a nephew of his who is hospitalized due to a drug overdose.     Virgil Tibbs returns from Jackson with his juris doctor, which explains his absence, in his new capacity as attorney in three episodes and assists the Sparta P.D. with several cases after having moved into Ben Taylors law office. Virgil reveals to Gillespie in Virgil Tibbs: Attorney At Law that Althea has left him and took their twins back home to Philadelphia to live, fed up with her life in Sparta and traumatized from all that had happened to her while living there. She didnt want to make the marriage work and later files for divorce, which a heartbroken Virgil does not contest, although he has difficulty accepting his new status as a divorced man.
