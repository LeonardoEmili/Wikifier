When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part .

Berlioz Orchestral Music. London, BBC. Numerous examples of Berlioz’s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his  Symphonie fantastique . The opening of the fourth movement, entitled “March to the Scaffold” features what for the time must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds. The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass:      “Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.” Boulez, P.

Boulez on Conducting. London, Faber.   Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where “The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.” Macdonald, H.

The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.” Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera  Lohengrin , where “the ethereal quality of the music” is due to the violins being “divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.” Latham, P. “Wagner: Aesthetics and Orchestration.” Gramophone, June 42      As he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing ": null
