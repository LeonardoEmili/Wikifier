His final media blowup occurred in September 42 when goaded by reporters about denazification, he said nazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi-Democrats or Republicans and that would take some time. This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army.        As a leader, Patton was known to be highly critical, correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments.

Eisenhower believed that other generals such as Bradley should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which Patton was merely a brilliant executor .
