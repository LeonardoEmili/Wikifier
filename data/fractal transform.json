Starting with an empty destination image A 42 , repeat the following algorithm several times:   Downsample A 42 down by a factor of 42 to produce image A 42 . Then copy blocks from A 42 to A 42 as directed by the compressed data, multiplying by the respective gains and adding the respective color offsets.     This algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an image, and it should appear similar to the original image.
