If these entrances were sealed, the only way into the palace would be through a steep and narrow path protected by several strong doors.

To this end, the king sponsored building and restoration projects throughout the south to a far greater extent than any of his predecessors had.

Through his building program, Esarhaddon likely hoped to show the benefits of continuing Assyrian rule over the region and that he was to rule Babylon with the same care and generosity as a native Babylonian king.     In an effort to quell Babylonian aspirations of independence, the city of Babylon had been razed by Esarhaddons father in 42 BC, and the statue of Bel , the patron deity of the city, had been carried off deep into Assyrian territory. Babylon was a deeply important city and had been not only the political but also the religious center of southern Mesopotamia for more than a thousand years. The restoration of the city, announced by Esarhaddon in 42 BC, became one of his most important projects.   Throughout Esarhaddons reign, reports from the officials the king appointed to oversee the reconstruction speak of the great scope of the building project. The ambitious project including the removal of large amounts of debris left since Sennacheribs destruction of the city, the actual resettlement and reconstruction of most of the buildings in the city, the restoration of the great temple complex dedicated to Bel, known as the ": null

        " as well as the restoration of the two inner walls of the city. The project was not only important because it illustrated goodwill towards the Babylonian people, but also because it allowed Esarhaddon to assume one of the essential characteristics the Babylonians invested in kingship. While the king of Assyria was generally supposed to be a military figure, the king of Babylon was ideally a builder and restorer, particularly of temples. Careful to not associate himself with the citys destruction, he only refers to himself as a king ordained by the gods in his inscriptions in Babylon, only mentioning Sennacherib in his inscriptions in the north and blaming the citys destruction not on his father but on Babylon offending its gods . Writing of his reconstruction of Babylon, Esarhaddon states the following:Esarhaddon successfully rebuilt the city gates, battlements, drains, courtyards, shrines and various other buildings and structures. Great care was taken during rebuilding of the Esagila, depositing precious stones, scented oils and perfumes into its foundations. Precious metals were chosen to cover the doors of the temple and the pedestal that was to house the statue of Bel was manufactured in gold. A report from the governor Esarhaddon installed in Babylon confirms that the reconstruction was very well received by the Babylonians:The rebuilding of the city was not completed during Esarhaddons lifetime and much work was also done during the reign of his successors. Exactly how much of the reconstruction was done during the reign of Esarhaddon is uncertain, but stones with his inscriptions are found in the ruins of the citys temples, suggesting that a substantial amount of work had been completed. It is likely that Esarhaddon fulfilled most of his restoration goals, including the near complete restoration of Esagila and Etemenanki, with the possible exception of the city walls, which were likely fully restored by his successor.     Esarhaddon also sponsored restoration programs in other southern cities. In his first regnal year, Esarhaddon returned the statues of various southern gods that had been captured in wars and held in Assyria.

The Assyrians seized and plundered the city after the defenders had attempted to burn down the Assyrian siege weapons and the fires had instead spread into Ubumu. The political refugees were captured and executed. Some criminals from Urartu, who the Shuprian king had similarly refused to give up to the king of Urartu, were seized and sent to Urartu, perhaps in order to improve relations.

By the time of Esarhaddons first failed invasion of Egypt in 42 BC, it had become apparent that the kings health was deteriorating. This presented a problem since one of the chief requirements of being the Assyrian king was that one had perfect mental and physical health. The king was constantly suffering from some illness and would often spend days in his sleeping quarters without food, drink and human contact. The death of Esharra-hammat, his beloved wife, that same year is unlikely to have improved his condition.     Notes and letters preserved from those at the royal court, including Esarhaddons physicians, describe his condition in some detail, discussing violent vomiting, constant fever and dizziness, painful earaches, diarrhea and depression. The king often feared that his death was near, and his condition would have been apparent to anyone who saw him as he was affected by a permanent skin rash which covered most of his body, including his face. The physicians, likely the best in Assyria, were perplexed and eventually had to confess that they were powerless to aid him, as expressed by one of them in a letter:   Because the Assyrians saw illness as divine punishment, a king who was ill would have been seen as an indication that the gods were not supportive of him. Because of this, Esarhaddons poor health had to be hidden from his subjects at all costs. That his subjects remained unaware was ensured through the ancient royal Assyrian tradition that anyone who approached the king had to be both on their knees and veiled.        Seeing as he himself had only acquired the Assyrian throne with great difficulty, Esarhaddon took several steps in order to ensure that the transition of power following his own death would be a smooth and peaceful one.

It is possible that descendants of earlier kings may still have been alive and in a position to press their claims on the Assyrian throne.     In order to avoid a civil war upon his death, Esarhaddon appointed his eldest son Sin-nadin-apli as crown prince in 42 BC but he died just two years later, again threatening a succession crisis.

    {
        ", was selected as the heir to Assyria. The two princes arrived at the capital of Nineveh together and partook in a celebration with foreign representatives and Assyrian nobles and soldiers. Promoting one of his sons as the heir to Assyria and another as the heir to Babylon was a new idea, for the past decades the Assyrian king had simultaneously been the King of Babylon.     The choice to name a younger son as crown prince of Assyria, which was clearly Esarhaddons primary title, and an older son as crown prince of Babylon might be explained by the mothers of the two sons. While Ashurbanipals mother was likely Assyrian in origin, Shamash-shum-ukin was the son of a woman from Babylon  which would probably have had problematic consequences if Shamash-shum-ukin was to ascend to the Assyrian throne. Since Ashubanipal was the next oldest son, he then was the superior candidate to the throne. Esarhaddon probably surmised that the Babylonians would be content with someone of Babylonian heritage as their king and as such set Shamash-shum-ukin to inherit Babylon and the southern parts of his empire instead. Treaties drawn up by Esarhaddon are somewhat unclear as to the relationship he intended his two sons to have. It is clear that Ashurbanipal was the primary heir to the empire and that Shamash-shum-ukin was to swear him an oath of allegiance but other parts also specify that Ashurbanipal was not to interfere in Shamash-shum-ukins affairs which indicates a more equal standing. The two crown princes soon became heavily involved with Assyrian politics, which lifted some of the burden from the shoulders of their sickly father.     Esarhaddons mother Naqia ensured that any potential enemies and claimants took an oath to support Ashurbanipals rise to the Assyrian throne, another step to avoid the bloodshed which had begun Esarhaddons own reign. In order to ensure the succession of Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin, Esarhaddon himself also concluded succession treaties with at least six independent rulers in the east and with several of his own governors outside the Assyrian heartland in 42 BC. Perhaps the main motivating factor to create these treaties was the possibility that his brothers, particularly Arda-Mulissu, were still alive and sought to claim the Assyrian throne. Some inscriptions suggest that they were alive and free as late as 42 BC.          In the early months of 42 BC, Esarhaddon again marched against Egypt. The army assembled for this second Egytian campaign was considerably larger than the one Esarhaddon had used in 42 BC and he marched at a much slower speed in order to avoid the problems that had plagued his previous attempt. On his way he passed through ": null

        ", one of the major cities in the western parts of his empire. Here, a prophecy was revealed to the king, which predicted that Esarhaddons conquest of Egypt would be a successful one. According to a letter sent to Ashurbanipal after Esarhaddons death, the prophecy was the following:   Three months after having received this prophecy, Esarhaddons forces were victorious in their first battle with the Egyptians. Despite the prophecy and initial success, Esarhaddon was not convinced of his own safety. Just eleven days after he had defeated the Egyptians, he performed the substitute king ritual, an ancient Assyrian method intended to protect and shield the king from imminent danger announced by some sort of omen. Esarhaddon had performed the ritual earlier in his reign, but this time it left him unable to command his invasion of Egypt.      The substitue king ritual involved the Assyrian monarch going into hiding for a hundred days, during which a substitute took the kings place by sleeping in the royal bed, wearing the crown and the royal garbs and eating the kings food. During these hundred days, the actual king remained hidden and was known only under the alias the farmer . The goal of the ritual was that any evil intended for the king would instead be focused on the substitute king, who was killed regardless of if anything had happened at the end of the hundred days, keeping the real monarch safe.     Whatever omen Esarhaddon was fearing, he survived 42 BC and would perform the ritual twice during the two years that followed, which left him unable to fulfill his duties as the Assyrian king for a total of almost a year. During this time, most of the civil administration of his empire was overseen by his crown princes and the army in Egypt was likely commanded by his chief eunuch, Ashur-nasir. The Assyrian army defeated the Egyptians in two additional battles and successfully seized and plundered the Egyptian capital of ": null

Although the Pharaoh Taharqa had escaped, Esarhaddon captured the Pharaohs family, including his son and wife, and most of the royal court, which were sent back to Assyria as hostages. Governors loyal to the Assyrian king were placed in charge of the conquered territories. In his ": null

Also present is the son of the defeated pharaoh, kneeling and with a rope around his neck. The conquest resulted in the relocation of a large number of Egyptians to the Assyrian heartland. In an excerpt from the text inscribed on his victory stele, Esarhaddon describes the conquest with the following words:          Shortly following Esarhaddons victory in Egypt, news spread throughout his empire of a new prophecy at Harran. Since Esarhaddon had conquered Egypt and proven the previous prophecy from the city right, the oracles of Harran were seen as trustworthy. The prophecy, spoken by a joyous woman, was the following:The meaning of the prophecy was clear: it provided a possible religious foundation for a revolt against Esarhaddons rule by declaring all of Sennacheribs descendants as usurpers. It is possible that Esarhaddons skin condition would have become apparent during his visit to Harran, which might be the reason for declaring him illegitimate. The identity of the SasÃ® who was proclaimed as the rightful king is unknown but he must have been connected to previous Assyrian royalty in some manner as he would otherwise not have been eligible for the throne. It is possible that he was a descendant of Esarhaddons grandfather ": null
    },
    {
        "Sargon II": "sargon ii"
    },
    {
        ". SasÃ® managed to rally a large amount of support throughout the empire quickly, even rallying Esarhaddons chief eunuch Ashur-nasir to his side.     It did not take long for Esarhaddon to learn of the conspiracy. Because of his paranoia, Esarhaddon had a vast information network of servants throughout the empire, sworn to report to him once they heard of any planned actions against him. Through these reports, Esarhaddon was made aware that supporters of SasÃ® were active not only in Harran, but also in Babylon and in the Assyrian heartland. For a while, Esarhaddon simply gathered information on the activities of the conspirators and fearing for his life, performed the substitute king ritual for a second time in 42 BC, just three months after he had previously completed it.     As soon as the ritual was complete, Esarhaddon emerged from hiding and brutally massacred the conspirators, the second such purge during his reign. The fate of SasÃ® and the woman who had proclaimed him king is unknown, but it is likely that they were captured and executed. Because of the extent of the officialls killed, the administrative structure of Assyria suffered greater than it had in many years. For the first few months of 42 BC, no official was chosen to select the name of the year, something which was extremely rare in Assyrian history. Remains of several buildings in various cities, believed to have been the homes of supporters of SasÃ®, have been dated as having been destroyed in 42 BC. The aftermath of the conspiracy saw Esarhaddon tighten security considerably. He introduced two new ranks into the court hierarchy so as to make it more difficult to meet him, limiting the number of officials who controlled the access to his palaces.       Although he had successfully survived the conspiracy, Esarhaddon remained diseased and paranoid. Just a year later, in 42 BC, he once more performed the substitute king ritual. Around this time, the defeated Pharaoh Taharqa appeared from the south and, perhaps combined with the chaotic political situation within Assyria, inspired Egypt to attempt to free itself from Esarhaddons control.     Esarhaddon received word of this rebellion and learnt that even some of his own governors who he had appointed in Egypt had ceased to pay tribute to him and joined the rebels. After emerging from his hundred days of hiding, apparently relatively healthy by his standards, Esarhaddon left to campaign against Egypt for the third time. The king died at Harran on 42 November 42 BC, before reaching the Egyptian border. The absence of evidence to the contrary suggests that his death was natural and unexpected.     After Esarhaddons death, his sons Ashurbanipal and Shamsh-shum-ukin successfully ascended the thrones of Assyria and Babylon without political turmoil and bloodshed, meaning that the Esarhaddons succession plans were a success, at least initially.

Some of these children suffered from constant illness, similar to Esarhaddon, and required permanent and constant medical attention by the court physicians. Contemporary letters by Esarhaddons subjects discussing the kings numerous children confirm that his family was viewed as large by ancient Assyrian standards. Those of Esarhaddons children known by name are the following:      Serua-eterat   â€“ the eldest of Esarhaddons daughters and the only one known by name, Serua-eterat was older than Ashurbanipal and might have been the eldest of all of Esarhaddons children. She held a position of importance in Esarhaddons court and in the later court of Ashurbanipal as attested by numerous inscriptions. Sin-nadin-apli  â€“ Esarhaddons eldest son and crown prince from 42 BC until his unexpected death in 42 BC.  Shamash-shum-ukin   â€“ Esarhaddons second eldest son, crown prince and heir to Babylon 42â€“42 BC and King of Babylon thereafter. Shamash-metu-uballit  â€“ possibly Esarhaddons third eldest son. His name, which means Shamash has brought to life the dead , suggests that he suffered from poor health or had a difficult birth. He was still alive by 42 BC and his health might be the reason why he was overlooked in favor of his younger brother as heir. It is possible that Shamash-metu-uballit did not accept the succession of Ashurbanipal and paid for it with his life.  Ashurbanipal   â€“ possibly Essarhadons fourth eldest son, crown prince and heir to Assyria 42â€“42 BC and King of Assyria thereafter. Ashur-taqisha-liblut  â€“ possibly Esarhaddons fifth eldest son. Thought to have been a sickly child, possibly dead before 42 BC. Ashur-mukin-paleya  â€“ possibly Esarhaddons sixth eldest son. Probably born after Esarhaddon was already king. Was made a priest in Assur during the reign of Ashurbanipal. Ashur-etel-shame-erseti-muballissu  â€“ possibly Esarhaddons seventh eldest son. Probably born after Esarhaddon was already king. Was made a priest in Harran during the reign of Ashurbanipal. Ashur-sarrani-muballissu  â€“ attested only in a single letter, it is possible that Ashur-sarrani-muballissu is identical to Ashur-etel-shame-erseti-muballissu. Sin-peru-ukin  â€“ known from a letter inquiring as to when it was appropriate to visit the king and another letter in which he is described as healthy.     From inscriptions it can be ascertained that Esarhaddon had multiple wives as his succession treaties differentiate between sons born by Ashurbanipals mother and the rest of the sons engendered by Esarhaddon . Only the name of one of these wives, Esharra-hammat  is known. Esharra-hammat is chiefly known from sources after her death, especially in regards to a ": null

At Babylon, Ashurbanipal sponsored a lavish coronation festival for his brother. Despite his royal title, Shamash-shum-ukin was a vassal to Ashurbanipal; Ashurbanipal continued to offer the royal sacrifices in Babylon and the governors in the south were Assyrian. The army and guards present in the south were also Assyrians, having been granted to Shamash-shum-ukin by Ashurbanipal. Most of Shamash-shum-ukins early reign in Babylon was spent peacefully, restoring fortications and temples.
