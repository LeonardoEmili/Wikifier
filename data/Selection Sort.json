The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element , and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.     The time efficiency of selection sort is quadratic, so there are a number of sorting techniques which have better time complexity than selection sort. Selection sort makes n - 1 swaps in the worst case. The time efficiency of selection sort with respect to swapping is linear, which distinguishes selection sort from other sorting algorithms.       Here is an example of this sort algorithm sorting five elements:               Selection sort can also be used on list structures that make add and remove efficient, such as a ": null
