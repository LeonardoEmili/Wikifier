        " super-weapon is an exception to this; compared to other similarly named weapons in the Doom/Quake series, Quake III Arenas incarnation of this weapon is basically a fast-firing rocket launcher and it is found in hard-to-reach locations. Weapons appear as level items, spawning at regular intervals in set locations on the map. If a player dies, all of their weapons are lost and they receive the spawn weapons for the current map, usually the gauntlet and machine gun. Players also drop the weapon they were using when killed, which other players can then pick up.     Quake III Arena comes with several gameplay modes: Free for All , a classic deathmatch, where each player competes against the rest for the highest score, Team Deathmatch , where usually two teams of four compete for the highest team frag total, Tournament , a deathmatch between two players, usually ending after a set time, and Capture the Flag , which is played on symmetrical maps where teams have to recover the enemy flag from the opponents base while retaining their own.     Quake III Arena was specifically designed for multiplayer . The game allows players whose computers are connected by a network or to the internet , to play against each other in real time , and incorporates a handicap system. It employs a clientâ€“server model , requiring all players clients to connect to a server. Quake III Arenas focus on multiplayer gameplay spawned a lively community, similar to QuakeWorld , that is active to this day.
