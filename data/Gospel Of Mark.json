Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that the end of history was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centre of his plans. Christians read the Jewish scripture as a figure or type of Jesus Christ, so that the goal of Christian literature became an experience of the living Christ. The new movement spread around the eastern Mediterranean and to Rome and further west, and assumed a distinct identity, although the groups within it remained extremely diverse.     The gospels were written for an audience already Christian  – their purpose was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, not to convert unbelievers. Christian churches were small communities of believers, often based on households , and the evangelists often wrote on two levels, one the historical presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the authors own day. Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew and those of the early church . More fundamentally, some scholars believe Marks reason for writing was to counter believers who saw Jesus in a Greek way, as wonder-worker ; Mark saw the suffering of the messiah as essential, so that the Son of God title had to be corrected and amplified with the Son of Man title, which conveyed ": null

Peters confession at Mark 8:27–30 that Jesus is the messiah thus forms the watershed to the whole gospel.

The earliest and most reliable manuscripts of Mark end at , with the women fleeing in fear from the empty tomb: the majority of recent scholars believe this to be the original ending, and this is supported by statements from the early Church Fathers Eusebius and Jerome. Two attempts were made to provide a more satisfactory conclusion. A minority of later manuscripts have what is called the shorter ending , an addition to  telling how the women told those around Peter all that the angel had commanded and how the message of eternal life was then sent out by Jesus himself. This addition differs from the rest of Mark both in style and in its understanding of Jesus. The overwhelming majority of manuscripts have the longer ending , , with accounts of the resurrected Jesus, the commissioning of the disciples to proclaim the gospel, and Christs ascension.

The author introduces his work as gospel , meaning good news , a literal translation of the Greek evangelion   – he uses the word more often than any other writer in the New Testament besides Paul.

As in all the gospels, the messianic identity of Jesus is supported by a number of themes, including: the depiction of his disciples as obtuse, fearful and uncomprehending; the refutation of the charge made by Jesus enemies that he was a magician; secrecy surrounding his true identity .       In Mark, the disciples, and especially the Twelve, move from lack of perception of Jesus to rejection of the way of suffering to flight and denial  – even the women who received the first proclamation of his resurrection can be seen as failures for not reporting the good news. There is much discussion of this theme among scholars. Some argue that the author of Mark was using the disciples to correct erroneous views in his own community concerning the reality of the suffering messiah, others that it is an attack on the Jerusalem branch of the church for resisting the extension of the gospel to the gentiles, or a mirror of the converts usual experience of the initial enthusiasm followed by growing awareness of the necessity for suffering. It certainly reflects the strong theme in Mark of Jesus as the suffering just one portrayed in so many of the books of the Jewish scriptures, from Jeremiah to Job and the Psalms, but especially in the ": null

And in the real-world context in which the gospel was written, the persecutions of the Christians of Rome under Nero , the failure of the disciples and Jesus denial by Peter himself would have been powerful symbols of faith, hope and reconciliation.       Mark contains twenty accounts of miracles and healings, accounting for almost a third of the gospel and half the first ten chapters, more, proportionally, than in any other gospel. In the gospels as a whole, Jesus miracles, prophecies, etc., are presented as evidence of Gods rule, but Marks descriptions of Jesus healings are a partial exception to this, as his methods, using spittle to heal blindness and magic formulae , were those of a magician. This is the charge the Jewish religious leaders bring against Jesus: they say he is performing exorcisms with the aid of an evil spirit and calling up the spirit of John the Baptist . There was  ... no period in the history of the empire in which the magician was not considered an enemy of society, subject to penalties ranging from exile to death, says Classical scholar Ramsay MacMullen.

In Hellenistic culture the same phrase meant a divine man , a supernatural being. There is little evidence that son of God was a title for the messiah in 1st century Judaism, and the attributes which Mark describes in Jesus are much more those of the Hellenistic miracle-working divine man than of the Jewish Davidic messiah.     Mark does not explicitly state what he means by Son of God , nor when the sonship was conferred.
