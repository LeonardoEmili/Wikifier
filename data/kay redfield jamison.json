Wesley Boyd, an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychiatry at Tufts Universitys School of Medicine, wrote, Jamisons description illustrates the importance of merely being present for our patients and not trying to soothe them with platitudes or promises of a better future. Boyd, J. Wesley. Stories of Illness: Authorship in Medicine Psychiatry, Vol. 60 Winter 1997: 352. Print       Jamison has said she is an exuberant person who longs for peace and tranquility but in the end prefers tumultuousness coupled to iron discipline to a stunningly boring life.  In An Unquiet Mind, she concluded:     I long ago abandoned the notion of a life without storms, or a world without dry and killing seasons. Life is too complicated, too constantly changing, to be anything but what it is. And I am, by nature, too mercurial to be anything but deeply wary of the grave unnaturalness involved in any attempt to exert too much control over essentially uncontrollable forces. There will always be propelling, disturbing elements, and they will be there until, as Lowell put it, the watch is taken from the wrist. It is, at the end of the day, the individual moments of restlessness, of bleakness, of strong persuasions and maddened enthusiasms, that inform ones life, change the nature and direction of ones work, and give final meaning and color to ones loves and friendships.

She then found her calling in psychology. She flourished in this field and was extremely interested in mood disorders.
