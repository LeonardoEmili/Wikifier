        ".       The representation theory of Lie algebras plays an important role in various parts of theoretical physics. There, one considers operators on the space of states that satisfy certain natural commutation relations. These commutation relations typically come from a symmetry of the problemâ€”specifically, they are the relations of the Lie algebra of the relevant symmetry group. An example would be the ": null

        ", for example, quantum mechanics textbooks give a classification of the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra \\mathfrak .         Lie algebras can be classified to some extent. In particular, this has an application to the classification of Lie groups.       Analogously to abelian, nilpotent, and solvable groups, defined in terms of the derived subgroups, one can define abelian, nilpotent, and solvable Lie algebras.     A Lie algebra \\mathfrak is abelian if the Lie bracket vanishes, i.e. x,y 0, for all x and y in \\mathfrak .
