        ". Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower than that used for a register. Early electronic computer systems were often split into two groups, those with accumulators and those without.     Modern computer systems often have multiple general purpose registers that operate as accumulators, and the term is no longer as common as it once was. However, a number of special-purpose processors still use a single accumulator for their work to simplify their design.       Mathematical operations often take place in a stepwise fashion, using the results from one operation as the input to the next. For instance, a manual calculation of a workers weekly payroll might look something like:     look up the number of hours worked from the employees time card   look up the pay rate for that employee from a table   multiply the hours by the pay rate to get their basic weekly pay   multiply their basic pay by a fixed percentage to account for income tax   subtract that number from their basic pay to get their weekly pay after tax   multiply that result by another fixed percentage to account for retirement plans   subtract that number from their basic pay to get their weekly pay after all deductions     A computer program carrying out the same task would follow the same basic sequence of operations, although the values being looked up would all be stored in computer memory. In early computers the number of hours would likely be held on a ": null

    {
        ". Once the multiplication is complete, the result needs to be placed somewhere. On a drum machine this would likely be back to the drum, an operation that takes considerable time. And then the very next operation has to read that value back in, which introduces another considerable delay.     Accumulators dramatically improve performance in systems like these by providing a scratchpad area where the results of one operation can be fed to the next one for little or no performance penalty. In the example above, the basic weekly pay would be calculated and placed in the accumulator, which could then immediately be used by the income tax calculation. This removes one save and one read operation from the sequence, operations that generally took tens to hundreds of times as long as the multiplication itself.

We will call such an organ an Accumulator. It is quite conventional in principle in past and present computing machines of the most varied types, e.g. desk multipliers, standard IBM counters, more modern relay machines, the ENIAC .     Just a few of the instructions are, for example :   Clear accumulator and add number from memory location X   Clear accumulator and subtract number from memory location X   Add number copied from memory location X to the contents of the accumulator   Subtract number copied from memory location X from the contents of the accumulator   Clear accumulator and shift contents of register into accumulator     No convention exists regarding the names for operations from registers to accumulator and from accumulator to registers.
