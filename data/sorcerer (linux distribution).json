Software to install is cast onto the computer. Installed software can be removed by dispelling . Consequently, the command line tools for casting and dispelling software are called cast and dispel, respectively.       In 2000, Kyle Sallee created a source-based Linux distribution called Sorcerer GNU/Linux and released it under the GNU GPL. During this time Sorcerer was a technology demonstration rather than a stable distribution. Eventually the distribution tools, called sorcery, and the software catalog, called grimoire, were redesigned and rewritten to be stable and usable on production machines. Due to the effort involved in single handedly creating and maintaining a distribution Sallee ceased Sorcerer GNU/Linux during the redesign and rewrite of sorcery and grimoire. A month or two before the rewrite happened, in early 2002, Chuck S. Mead, who had previously created a fork of RedHat, created a fork of Sorcerer GNU/Linux. The first fork of Sorcerer GNU/Linux was called by the same name as Meads fork of RedHat. It was called either Lunar Penguin or ": null

A new grimoire , which is a catalog of software supported for immediate installation, is made available daily. When new sources are available, the spells in the grimoire are updated. A users desktop is updated by first installing a current grimoire. If necessary, the installed Sorcery is updated. Finally, installed software can be updated according to the users decision. Users can also add new spells to the grimoire on their local machine and submit the new spell for inclusion in the general distribution.     Sorcery automatically recompiles installed software as necessary to ensure continued compatibility and usability when installed libraries are updated. Unlike a pre-compiled binary-based distribution that must always download new packages, Sorcery most often recompiles installed software from previously downloaded sources. When a new source is required and an older source was previously downloaded, then Sorcerer will download a tiny patch that transforms the old source tarball into a current source tarball. The practice of keeping old source tarballs and downloading patches for updates allows Sorcerer systems to be updated using less bandwidth than distributions that provide pre-compiled packages.
