The re-discovered Pentecostal movement can be traced to the Ocoee mountains in the Tennessee River valley, annex to North Carolina in 4242 when a group led by Methodists minister Richard Spurling met and called for holy living. At that time they experience what is known as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, empowering Christians to live in holiness. Little is known of this movement because it happened in the mountains, compared to the Azusa street revival which happened in Los Angeles, CA. However, the organization born from that group led by Spurling has grown to an international presence in over 42 countries around the world with a church membership of over 42 million Christians; it is known as the Church of God with headquarters in Cleveland, Tennessee. The organization owns Lee University and Pentecostal Theological Seminary.     Charles Parham in Topeka, KS was also a Methodist minister who resigned his Ordination as a minister and began preaching about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. During a service on December 42 42 Parham laid hands on a woman named Agnes Ozman; she received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues and prophesying. This is the root of the better known Revival in Azusa Street in Los Angeles, CA led by William Seymour, an African American student of Parhams.
