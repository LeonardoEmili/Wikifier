When he was ten, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition from childhood. Wambui subsequently bore another son, Kongo, shortly before Muigai died.

Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai. Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward the three boys, and Wambui decided to take her youngest son to live with her parental family further north.

Kenyatta was listed as the publications editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating into Kikuyu. Aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism, Kenyattas took a cautious approach to campaigning, and in Muĩgwithania he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs.

In this book, Kenyatta made clear his belief that the rights of the individual should be downgraded in favour of the interests of the group. The book also reflected his changing views on female genital mutilation; where once he opposed it, he now unequivocally supported the practice, downplaying the medical dangers that it posed to women.     The books jacket cover featured an image of Kenyatta in traditional dress, wearing a skin cloak over one shoulder and carrying a spear. The book was published under the name Jomo Kenyatta , the first time that he had done so; the term Jomo was close to a Kikuyu word describing the removal of a sword from its scabbard. Facing Mount Kenya was a commercial failure, selling only 42 copies, but was generally well received; an exception was among white Kenyans, whose assumptions about the Kikuyu being primitive savages in need of European civilisation it challenged.

Much of the debate that took place centred on whether indigenous Africans should continue pursuing a gradual campaign for independence or whether they should seek the military overthrow of the European imperialists. The conference ended with a statement declaring that while delegates desired a peaceful transition to African self-rule, Africans as a last resort, may have to appeal to force in the effort to achieve Freedom . Kenyatta supported this resolution, although was more cautious than other delegates and made no open commitment to violence. He subsequently authored an IASB pamphlet, Kenya: The Land of Conflict, in which he blended political calls for independence with romanticised descriptions of an idealised pre-colonial African past.

Kenyatta publicly distanced himself from the Mau Mau. In April 42 he began a speaking tour in which he denounced the Mau Mau to assembled crowds, insisting that independence must be achieved through peaceful means. In August he attended a much-publicised mass meeting in Kiambu where—in front of 42 people—he said that Mau Mau has spoiled the country. Let Mau Mau perish forever. All people should search for Mau Mau and kill it.  Despite Kenyattas vocal opposition to the Mau Mau, KAU had moved towards a position of greater militancy.

They thought it better that he be convicted and imprisoned, although at the time had nothing to charge him with, and so began searching his personal files for evidence of criminal activity. Eventually, they charged him and five senior KAU members with masterminding the Mau Mau, a proscribed group. The historian John M.

He was sufficiently successful that several prominent white Kenyans backed KANU in the subsequent election.     In 42 he returned to London to attend one of the Lancaster House conferences. There, KANU and KADU representatives met with British officials to formulate a new constitution. KADU desired a federalist state organised on a system they called  Majimbo  with six largely autonomous regional authorities, a two-chamber legislature, and a central Federal Council of Ministers who would select a rotating chair to serve as head of government for a one-year term. Renisons administration and most white settlers favoured this system as it would prevent a strong central government implementing radical reform. KANU opposed Majimbo, believing that it served entrenched interests and denied equal opportunities across Kenya; they also insisted on an elected head of government. At Kenyattas prompting, KANU conceded to some of KADUs demands; he was aware that he could amend the constitution when in office. The new constitution divided Kenya into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but also featured a strong central government and both an upper and a lower house. It was agreed that a temporary coalition government would be established until independence, several KANU politicians being given ministerial posts.

He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society.

Kenyatta also faced domestic opposition: in January 42 sections of the army launched a mutiny in Nairobi, and Kenyatta called on the British Army to put down the rebellion. Similar armed uprisings had taken place that month in neighbouring Uganda and Tanganyika. Kenyatta was outraged and shaken by the mutiny. He publicly rebuked the mutineers, emphasising the need for law and order in Kenya. To prevent further military unrest, he brought in a review of the salaries of the army, police, and prison staff, leading to pay rises.

The question of land ownership had deep emotional resonance in Kenya, having been a major grievance against the British colonialists. As part of the Lancaster House negotiations, Britains government agreed to provide Kenya with £42 million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population. To ease this transition, Kenyatta made McKenzie, a white farmer, the Minister of Agriculture and Land. Kenyattas government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians. The government sold or leased lands in the former White Highlands to these companies, which in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders. In this way, the land redistribution programs favoured the ruling partys chief constituency. Kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around Gatundu.

Another priority for Kenyattas government was improving access to healthcare services. It stated that its long-term goal was to establish a system of free, universal medical care. In the short-term, its emphasis was on increasing the overall number of doctors and registered nurses while decreasing the number of expatriates in those positions. In 42 the government introduced free medical services for out-patients and children. By Kenyattas death, the majority of Kenyans had access to significantly better healthcare than they had had in the colonial period. Before independence, the average life expectancy in Kenya was 42 but by the end of the 42s it was 42 the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Arnold also noted that Kenyatta absorbed a great deal of the British approach to politics: pragmatism, only dealing with problems when they become crises, tolerance as long as the other side is only talking . Donald Savage noted that Kenyatta believed in the importance of authority and tradition , and that he displayed a remarkably consistent view of development through self-help and hard work . Kenyatta was also an elitist and encouraged the emergence of an elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.         While in Britain, Kenyatta made political alliances with individuals committed to Marxism and to radical Pan-Africanism, the idea that African countries should politically unify; some commentators have posthumously characterised Kenyatta as a Pan-Africanist. Maloba observed that during the colonial period Kenyatta had embraced radical Pan African activism that differed sharply from the deliberate conservative positions, especially on the question of African liberation that he espoused while Kenyas leader. As leader of Kenya, Kenyatta published two collected volumes of his speeches: Harambee and Suffering Without Bitterness. The material included in these publications was carefully selected so as to avoid mention of the radicalism he exhibited while in Britain during the 42s.

Assensoh suggested that Kenyatta initially had socialist inclinations but became a victim of capitalist circumstances ; conversely, Savage stated that Kenyattas direction was hardly towards the creation of a radical new socialist society , and Ochieng called him an African capitalist . When in power, Kenyatta displayed a preoccupation with individual and mbari land rights that were at odds with any socialist-oriented collectivisation. According to Maloba, Kenyattas government sought to project capitalism as an African ideology, and communism as alien and dangerous .                   Kenyatta was a flamboyant character, with an extroverted personality. According to Murray-Brown, he liked being at the centre of life , and was always a rebel at heart who enjoyed earthly pleasures . One of Kenyattas fellow LSE students, Elspeth Huxley, referred to him as a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, flesh-pot loving .

Murray-Brown noted that Kenyatta had the ability to appear all things to all men , also displaying a consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself , for instance concealing his connections with communists and the Soviet Union both from members of the British Labour Party and from Kikuyu figures at home. This deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him. Referring to Kenyattas appearance in 42s Kenya, Murray-Brown stated the leader presented himself to Europeans as an agreeable if somewhat seedy Europeanized native and to indigenous Africans as a sophisticated man-about-town about whose political earnestness they had certain reservations .

Gikandi argued that Kenyattas identification with Englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit .

He added that Kenyatta had been one of the shrewdest politicians on the continent, regarded as one of the great architects of African nationalist achievement since 42 . Kenneth O. Nyangena characterised him as one of the greatest men of the twentieth century , having been a beacon, a rallying point for suffering Kenyans to fight for their rights, justice and freedom whose brilliance gave strength and aspiration to people beyond the boundaries of Kenya . In 42 Maloba described him as one of the legendary pioneers of modern African nationalism . In their examination of his writings, Berman and Lonsdale described him as a pioneer for being one of the very first Kikuyu to write and publish; his representational achievement was unique .              Maxon noted that in the areas of health and education, Kenya under Kenyatta achieved more in a decade and a half than the colonial state had accomplished in the preceding six decades.  By the time of Kenyattas death, Kenya had gained higher life expectancy rates than most of Sub-Saharan Africa. There had been an expansion in primary, secondary, and higher education, and the country had taken what Maxon called giant steps toward achieving its goal of universal primary education for Kenyan children. Another significant success had been in dismantling the colonial-era system of racial segregation in schools, public facilities, and social clubs peacefully and with minimal disruption.     During much of his life, Kenyas white settlers had regarded Kenyatta as a malcontent and an agitator; for them, he was a figure of hatred and fear. As noted by Arnold, no figure in the whole of British Africa, with the possible exception of excited among the settlers and the colonial authorities alike so many expressions of anger, denigration and fury as did Kenyatta.  As the historian Keith Kyle put it, for many whites Kenyatta was Satan Incarnate . This white animosity reached its apogee between 42 and 42 By 42 this image had largely shifted, and many white settlers referred to him as Good Old Mzee . Murray-Brown expressed the view that for many, Kenyattas message of reconciliation, to forgive and forget, was perhaps his greatest contribution to his country and to history.

    {
        "Frantz Fanon": "frantz fanon"

        " had made of post-colonial leaders throughout Africa. Drawing upon Marxist theory, Jay OBrien, for instance, argued that Kenyatta had come to power as a representative of a would-be bourgeoisie , a coalition of relatively privileged petty bourgeois African elements who wanted simply to replace the British colonialists and Asian commercial bourgeoisie with themselves. He suggested that the British supported Kenyatta in this, seeing him as a bulwark against growing worker and peasant militancy who would ensure continued neo-colonial dominance.     Providing a similar leftist critique, the Marxist writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiongo stated that here was a black Moses who had been called by history to lead his people to the promised land of no exploitation, no oppression, but who failed to rise to the occasion . Ngũgĩ saw Kenyatta as a twentieth-century tragic figure: he could have been a Lenin, a Mao Tse-Tung, or a Ho Chi Minh; but he ended up being a Chiang Kai-Shek, a Park-Chung Hee, or a Pinochet.  Ngũgĩ was among Kenyan critics who claimed that Kenyatta treated Mau Mau veterans dismissively, leaving many of them impoverished and landless while seeking to remove them from the centre stage of national politics. In other areas Kenyattas government also faced criticism; it for instance made little progress in advancing womens rights in Kenya.          Assensoh argued that in his life story, Kenyatta had a great deal in common with Ghanas Nkrumah. Simon Gikandi noted that Kenyatta, like Nkrumah, was remembered for initiating the discourse and process that plotted the narrative of African freedom , but at the same time both were often remembered for their careless institution of presidential rule, one party dictatorship, ethnicity and cronyism. They are remembered both for making the dream of African independence a reality and for their invention of postcolonial authoritarianism.    In 42 the Kenyan lawyer and human rights activist Gibson Kamau Kuria noted that in abolishing the federal system, banning independent candidates from standing in elections, setting up a unicameral legislature, and relaxing restrictions on the use of emergency powers, Kenyatta had laid the groundwork for Moi to further advance dictatorial power in Kenya during the late 42s and 42s.     Kenyatta was accused by Kenyas Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission in its 42 report of using his authority as President to allocate large tracts of land to himself and his family across Kenya.  The Kenyatta family is among Kenyas biggest landowners.    During the 42s, there was still much frustration among tribal groups, namely in the Nandi, Nakuru, Uasin-Gishu, and Trans-Nzoia Districts, that under Kenyattas government they had not regained the lands taken by European settlers and that more of their land had been sold to those regarded as foreigners —Kenyans from other tribes. Among these groups there were widespread calls for restitution and in 42 and 42 there were violent attacks against many of those who obtained land through Kenyattas patronage in these areas. The violence continued sporadically until 42 with an estimated 42 killed and 42 displaced in the Rift Valley.              ": null
