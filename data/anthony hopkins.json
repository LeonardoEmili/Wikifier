However, Hopkins stated that  Red Dragon  would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series,  Hannibal Rising .           Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can do it without thinking . This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later. Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me  — Red Dragon DVD interview     ": null
