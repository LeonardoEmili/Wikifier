Hitler did not fully support the ambitious plans that Röhm had for this organization, which proved problematic. Hitler was distrustful of these paramilitary organizations because competing groups like the Bund Wiking, the Bund Bayern und Reich, and the Blücherbund were all vying for membership and he realized from the failed putsch that these groups could not be legitimized so long as the police and Reichwehr stayed loyal to the government.

Hitler was aware of Röhms homosexuality. Their friendship shows in that Röhm remained one of the few intimates allowed to use the familiar German du  when conversing with Hitler. In turn, Röhm was the only Nazi leader who dared to address Hitler by his first name Adolf or his nickname Adi rather than  . Their close association led to rumors that Hitler himself was homosexual. Unlike many in the Nazi hierarchy, Röhm never fell victim to Hitlers arresting personality nor did he come fully under his spell, which made him unique.

These radicals rejected exploitative capitalism and they intended to take steps to curb monopolies and promoted the nationalization of land and industry. Such plans were threatening to the business community in general, and to Hitlers corporate financial backers in particular—including many German industrial leaders he would rely upon for arms production—so to keep from alienating them Hitler swiftly reassured his powerful industrial allies that there would be no such revolution as espoused by these Party radicals.        Many SA storm troopers had working-class origins and longed for a radical transformation of German society. They were disappointed by the new regimes lack of socialistic direction and its failure to provide the lavish patronage they had expected. Furthermore, Röhm and his SA colleagues thought of their force as the core of the future German Army, and saw themselves as replacing the Reichswehr and its established professional officer corps.

Reports of a huge cache of weapons in the hands of SA members caused additional concern to the army leadership. Unsurprisingly, the officer corps opposed Röhms proposal. They insisted that discipline and honor would vanish if the SA gained control, but Röhm and the SA would settle for nothing less.
