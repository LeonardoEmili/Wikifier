Bohrium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known ": null

The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with 270 Bh and 274 Bh having measured half-lives of about 61  s and 40  s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope 278 Bh appearing to have an even longer half-life of about 690  s.     The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets.

Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO 3 Cl, so BhO 3 Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO 3 F and MO 2 F 3 for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF 5 and ReF 7 . Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.
