Burt 2007 p. 222     The pattern that the line-ending words follow is often explained if the numbers 1 to 6 are allowed to stand for the end-words of the first stanza. Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom-up pairing of the lines of the preceding stanza . Given that the pattern for the first stanza is 123456, this produces 615243 in the second stanza.          Another way of visualising the pattern of line-ending words for each stanza is by the procedure known as retrogradatio cruciata, which may be rendered as backward crossing . Krysl 2004 p. 9 The second stanza can be seen to have been formed from three sets of pairs , or two triads . The 1–2–3 triad appears in its original order, but the 4–5–6 triad is reversed and superimposed upon it. Shapiro 1980 pp. 7–8     The pattern of the line-ending words in a sestina is represented both numerically and alphabetically in the following table:          The sixth stanza is followed by a tercet that is known variably by the French term envoi, the Occitan term ": null

Gasparov 1996 p. 159 It consists of three lines that include all six of the line-endings words of the preceding stanzas. This should take the pattern of 2–5, 4–3, 6–1 ; the first end-word of each pair can occur anywhere in the line, while the second must end the line. Fry 2007 p. 234 However, the end-word order of the envoi is no longer strictly enforced. Fry 2007 p. 237          The sestina has been subject to some variations, with changes being made to both the size and number of stanzas, and also to individual line length. A double sestina is the name given to either: two sets of six six-line stanzas, with a three-line envoy , or twelve twelve-line stanzas, with a six-line envoy .

In the former variation, the original pattern of line-ending words, i.e. that of the first stanza, recurs in the seventh stanza, and thus the entire change of pattern occurs twice throughout. In the second variation, the pattern of line-ending words returns to the starting sequence in the eleventh stanza; thus it does not, unlike the single sestina, allow for every end-word to occupy each of the stanza ends; end-words 5 and 10 fail to couple between stanzas.
