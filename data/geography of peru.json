        "       Perus agricultural lands make up 42% of Perus total surface area, a substantially lower percentage compared to its neighbors who average at around 42% agricultural land.   Common crops include, but are not limited to root vegetables like potatoes and cassava; peppers including chilies and paprika; vegetables like asparagus, tomatoes; quinoa; kiwicha; and fruits like mangoes, passion fruit,citrus, and bananas.  Levels of undernourished citizens and children who suffer from undernourishment has dramatically decreased from just under six million to just over two million between 42 and 42 while food availability has increased from an energy percentage of 42 to 42 between 42 and 42      As food production in Peru increases, farmers saturate the soil with nutrients with Nitrogen and Phosphorus bases. Oversaturation of nutrients leads to eutrophication in nearby water bodies resulting in dead zones. Carbon emissions due to manufacturing and food processing leads to reduced air quality which contributes to the global warming that increases severity of natural disasters and acidifies the ocean leading to mass bleaching in coral reefs which will destroy oceanic ecosystems.
