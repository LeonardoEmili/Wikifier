Such limitations do not apply to grand jury investigations, many administrative proceedings, and may not apply to declarations used in support of an arrest or search warrant. Also some types of statements are not deemed to be hearsay and are not subject to such limitations.     An  expert witness  is one who allegedly has specialized knowledge relevant to the matter of interest, which knowledge purportedly helps to either make sense of other evidence, including other testimony, documentary evidence or physical evidence . An expert witness may or may not also be a percipient witness, as in a doctor or may or may not have treated the victim of an accident or crime.     A reputation witness is one who testifies about the reputation of a person or business entity, when reputation is material to the dispute at issue.
