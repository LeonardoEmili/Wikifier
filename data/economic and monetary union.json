There is a group of economists whose only role is studying how to improve the monetary policy in maintaining price stability. They conduct research, and their results are presented to the leaders of the EMU. Thereafter, the role of the leaders is to find a suitable way to implement the economists work into their countrys policies. Maintaining price stability is a long-term goal for all states in the EMU, due to the effects it might have on the Euro as a currency.     Second, the EMU must coordinate economic and fiscal policies in EU countries. They must find an equilibrium between the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. They will advise countries to have greater coordination, even if that means having countries tightly coupled with looser monetary and tighter fiscal policy. Not coordinating the monetary market could result in risking an unpredictable situation. The EMU will also have to deliberate on the option of a mixed policy which in some empirical studies have shown that sometimes it can have more benefits than expected.      Third, the EMU ensures that the single market runs smoothly . All member countries will respect the decisions made by the EMU and also ensuring that their actions will be in favor of a stable market      Finally, regulations of the EMU will aid in supervising and monitoring financial institutions . There is an imperative need for all members of the EMU to act in unison. Therefore, the EMU has to have institutions supervising all the member states to protect the main aim of the EMU.
