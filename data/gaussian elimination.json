Some authors use the term Gaussian elimination to refer to the process until it has reached its upper triangular, or row echelon form.

Therefore, if ones goal is to solve a system of linear equations, then using these row operations could make the problem easier.          For each row in a matrix, if the row does not consist of only zeros, then the leftmost nonzero entry is called the  leading coefficient   of that row.

Then by using the row swapping operation, one can always order the rows so that for every non-zero row, the leading coefficient is to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above. If this is the case, then matrix is said to be in row echelon form. So the lower left part of the matrix contains only zeros, and all of the zero rows are below the non-zero rows. The word echelon is used here because one can roughly think of the rows being ranked by their size, with the largest being at the top and the smallest being at the bottom.     For example, the following matrix is in row echelon form, and its leading coefficients are shown in red:     : \\begin   0 & \\color & 1 & -1 \\\\   0 & 0 & \\color & 1 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0   \\end.     It is in echelon form because the zero row is at the bottom, and the leading coefficient of the second row , is to the right of the leading coefficient of the first row .

These row operations are labelled in the table as     : \\begin   L_2 + \\tfrac32 L_1 & \\to L_2, \\\\   L_3 + L_1 & \\to L_3.   \\end     Once  is also eliminated from the third row, the result is a system of linear equations in triangular form, and so the first part of the algorithm is complete. From a computational point of view, it is faster to solve the variables in reverse order, a process known as back-substitution. One sees the solution is , , and . So there is a unique solution to the original system of equations.     Instead of stopping once the matrix is in echelon form, one could continue until the matrix is in reduced row echelon form, as it is done in the table. The process of row reducing until the matrix is reduced is sometimes referred to as Gauss–Jordan elimination, to distinguish it from stopping after reaching echelon form.

To explain how Gaussian elimination allows the computation of the determinant of a square matrix, we have to recall how the elementary row operations change the determinant:   Swapping two rows multiplies the determinant by −1   Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar multiplies the determinant by the same scalar   Adding to one row a scalar multiple of another does not change the determinant.     If Gaussian elimination applied to a square matrix  produces a row echelon matrix , let  be the product of the scalars by which the determinant has been multiplied, using the above rules. Then the determinant of  is the quotient by  of the product of the elements of the diagonal of :   : \\det \\frac.     Computationally, for an  matrix, this method needs only  arithmetic operations, while solving by elementary methods requires  or  operations. Even on the fastest computers, the elementary methods are impractical for  above 20.

For example, consider the following matrix:   : A   \\begin   2 & -1 & 0 \\\\   -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\   0 & -1 & 2   \\end.       To find the inverse of this matrix, one takes the following matrix augmented by the identity and row-reduces it as a 3  ×  6 matrix:   :   \\left       By performing row operations, one can check that the reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix is   :   \\left       One can think of each row operation as the left product by an ": null

This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.       The Gaussian elimination algorithm can be applied to any  matrix . In this way, for example, some 6  ×  9 matrices can be transformed to a matrix that has a row echelon form like   : T   \\begin   a & & & & & & & & \\\\   0 & 0 & b & & & & & & \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & c & & & & & \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & d & & \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & e \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0   \\end,     where the stars are arbitrary entries, and  are nonzero entries.
