Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine , interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises. While perceived quality varied widely, the energy and enthusiasm involved tended to be communicated clearly to the readership, many of whom were also fanzine contributors. During the 1970s, many fanzines  also became partly distributed through certain comic book distributors.     At times, the professional comics publishers have made overtures to fandom via prozines, in this case fanzine-like magazines put out by the major publishers.
