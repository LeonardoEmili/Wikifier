There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue to have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.  Research published in 42 in  Science  based on surface ocean salinity over the period 42 to 42 confirm this projection of an intensified global water cycle with salty areas becoming more saline and fresher areas becoming more fresh over the period: Fundamental thermodynamics and climate models suggest that dry regions will become drier and wet regions will become wetter in response to warming. Efforts to detect this long-term response in sparse surface observations of rainfall and evaporation remain ambiguous. We show that ocean salinity patterns express an identifiable fingerprint of an intensifying water cycle. Our 42-year observed global surface salinity changes, combined with changes from global climate models, present robust evidence of an intensified global water cycle at a rate of 42 ± 42% per degree of surface warming. This rate is double the response projected by current-generation climate models and suggests that a substantial intensification of the global water cycle will occur in a future 42° to 42° warmer world.
