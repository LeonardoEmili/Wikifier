Gelatin art desserts, also known as 3D gelatin desserts, are made by injecting colorful shapes into a flavored gelatin base. This 3D gelation art technique originated from Mexico and has spread along to Western and Pacific countries.     These desserts are made using high quality gelatin that has a high bloom value and low odor and taste. The clear gelatin base is prepared using gelatin, water, sugar, citric acid and food flavoring.     When the clear gelatin base sets, colorful shapes are injected using a syringe.     The injected material usually consists of a sweetener , some type of edible liquid , food coloring and a thickening agent such as starch or additional gelatin.     The shapes are drawn by making incisions in the clear gelatin base using sharp objects. Colored liquid is then allowed to fill the crevice and make the cut shape visible.     Most commonly, the shapes are drawn using sterile medical needles or specialized pre-cut gelatin art tools that allow the shape to be cut and filled with color at the same time.     Gelatin art tools are attached to a syringe and used to inject a predetermined shape into gelatin.     When combined with other ingredients, such as whipping cream or mousse, gelatin art desserts can be assembled into visually impressive formations resembling a cake.
