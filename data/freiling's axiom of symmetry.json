        ".     Freiling claims that probabilistic intuition strongly supports this proposition while others disagree. There are several versions of the axiom, some of which are discussed below.         Fix a function f in A. We will consider a thought experiment that involves throwing two darts at the unit interval. We arent able to physically determine with infinite accuracy the actual values of the numbers x and y that are hit. Likewise, the question of whether y is in f cannot actually be physically computed. Nevertheless, if f really is a function, then this question is a meaningful one and will have a definite yes or no answer.     Now wait until after the first dart, x, is thrown and then assess the chances that the second dart y will be in f. Since x is now fixed, f is a fixed countable set and has ": null

        " zero. Therefore, this event, with x fixed, has probability zero. Freiling now makes two generalizations:     Since we can predict with virtual certainty that y is not in f after the first dart is thrown, and since this prediction is valid no matter what the first dart does, we should be able to make this prediction before the first dart is thrown. This is not to say that we still have a measurable event, rather it is an intuition about the nature of being predictable.   Since y is not in f is predictably true, by the symmetry of the order in which the darts were thrown we should also be able to predict with virtual certainty that x is not in f .     The axiom \\texttt is now justified based on the principle that what will predictably happen every time this experiment is performed, should at the very least be possible. Hence there should exist two real numbers x, y such that x is not in f and y is not in f.       Fix \\kappa\\, an infinite cardinal . Let \\texttt_.\\, be the statement: there is no map f:\\wp\\to\\wp\\, from sets to sets of size \\leq\\kappa for which \\, either x\\in f\\, or y\\in f\\, .     Claim: \\texttt\\vdash 42^\\kappa^\\leftrightarrow\\neg\\texttt_.\\, .     Proof:   Part I :     Suppose 42^\\kappa^\\, . Then there exists a bijection \\sigma:\\kappa^\\to\\wp\\, . Setting f:\\wp\\to\\wp\\, defined via \\sigma\\mapsto \\\\, , it is easy to see that this demonstrates the failure of Freilings axiom.     Part II :     Suppose that Freilings axiom fails. Then fix some f\\, to verify this fact. Define an order relation on \\wp\\, by A\\leq_ B iff A\\in f . This relation is total and every point has \\leq\\kappa many predecessors.
