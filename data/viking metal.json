Ashby and Schofield agree with Mulvany that musically, Viking metal bands generally are unconnected with a real Viking past, but instead connote a broader sense of the maritime, presuming that this conflation of maritime contexts is a knowing one, but one nonetheless felt to be somehow evocative.

A lot of these bands, especially the bigger ones, are called folk metal but they dont really understand what real folk music is; though I know this is not true for all of them.        Thematically, Viking metal draws extensively on elements of black metal, but the lyrics and imagery are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation of violence and virility through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and black metal bands, with an interest in ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology and imagery of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep the Satanic elements of black metal but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes.

Within black metal, Norse imagery is used to build a view of natural and authentic masculinity to counter the oppressive force of the Judeo-Christian tradition.            The roots of Viking metal are generally found in Scandinavian metal, particularly the death and black metal scenes of the late 42s. Inspired by the Viking themes used by Manowar, some bands identified with the Vikings far more completely than Manowar. At the forefront of this movement stood the Swedish band Bathory.

With this album, Quorthon, the bands founder, inspired a generation of Nordic teens, and seeded a deep anti-Christian sentiment which culminated in the violence and hate crimes committed by members of the Norwegian black metal community in the early 42s. The artistic choices by Quorthon contain völkisch elements which emphasize a return to heathen Europe rather than a destructive Christianity. Quorthon later explained, in the liner notes to Blood on Ice, that his shift to Viking themes was an intentional move away from Satanism:      Bathorys Viking metal features Wagnerian-style epics, ostentatious arrangements, choruses, and ambient keyboards. Mulvany notes that Bathorys 42s work marks the beginning of a Viking-themed trend initially slow, even confusing, in formation. For example, the Austrian black metal band ": null

According to Mulvany, The Viking trend presaged by Abigor was actually taking place around them, and it remains more true to how black metal is often defined than the folk influenced metal that followed. Its folk elements are predominantly textual or musically evocative rather than musically-historically accurate.              Enslaved, formed in Norway in 42 has also been cited as the first truly Viking metal band, with the 42 EP by the band,  Hordanes Land , named as the first true Viking metal release. A review of  Eld  noted that Among the countless bands who were inspired by Bathorys seminal Viking metal, arguably none were as true to its gospel as Norways Enslaved, whose utmost commitment even extended to donning vintage Norse armor and outfits on-stage .

Though the previous recordings by Enslaved all featured the same thematic material, Frost was the first album that Enslaved described as Viking metal. This album also defined the bands lyrical approach.  Decibel  explains that on Frost, bassist and vocalist Grutle Kjellson knew it was time to reclaim the gods and goddesses of his ancestors, especially if it meant his version of things would inevitably clash with the Christianized fairytales so often associated with Nordic myth.

While Viking imagery may be readily appropriated, according to Hoad the definition of a true Viking is quite rigid, a rigidity which non-Nordic, and especially non-White, musicians must contend with. As an example, she cites the Brazilian band Viking Throne, which claims legitimacy through European ancestry and historical references to explorations of South America by Nordic countries, and quotes their front-man, Count Nidhogg: Some people understand perfectly that it doesnt matter where you live, whats really important is your heritage and ancestry. Even living in a South American country as Brazil we all have European blood.  Hoad argues that Viking Throne illustrates the cultural importance of claiming Viking ancestry, a culture that operates on largely geographic lines. In contrast to Viking Throne, she cites the band Slechtvalk, which is well known for its brand of ": null

Hoad speculates that the European ethnicity of the band is enough to compensate for its otherwise counter-intuitive music.       According to Weinstein, Viking metal has travelled further than any Viking ship. Self-defined pagan metal bands who describe their music as Viking metal can be found in the United States, Brazil and Uruguay, among other places.  The sensationalism of the early Norwegian black metal scene might be responsible for some of this popularity, but Weinstein considers the genres greatest influence to be the inspiration it has given to others to explore their own roots .
