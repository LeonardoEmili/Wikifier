The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when wed move on, because so much work had gone into them.  The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly the loudest voice according to OBrien.

Conversely, other critics have also argued that OK Computer is a concept album only in part, or in a nontraditional or qualified sense, or is not a concept album at all.  Although the songs share common themes, Radiohead have said they do not consider OK Computer a concept album and did not intend to link the songs through a narrative or unifying concept while it was being written.    Jonny Greenwood said: I think one album title and one computer voice do not make a concept album. Thats a bit of a red herring.  However, the band intended the album to be heard as a whole, and spent two weeks ordering the track list. OBrien said: The context of each song is really important  ...

The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it was chosen as the closing track because a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast and not being able to keep up. It was really obvious to have Tourist as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, Idiot, slow down. Because at that point, I needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down.
