This is deduced as follows:     :     The function d is also called distance function or simply distance. Often, d is omitted and one just writes M for a metric space if it is clear from the context what metric is used.     Ignoring mathematical details, for any system of roads and terrains the distance between two locations can be defined as the length of the shortest route connecting those locations. To be a metric there shouldnt be any one-way roads. The triangle inequality expresses the fact that detours arent shortcuts.
