Generally the size of the unwanted output falls rapidly as m and n increase.     Due to the additional outputs, this form of distortion is definitely unwanted in audio, radio and telecommunication amplifiers, and it occurs for more than two waves as well.     In a narrowband system such as a radio communication system, unwanted outputs such as X-Y and 42X+Y will be remote from the wanted band and so be ignored by the system. In contrast, 42X-Y and 42Y-X will be close to the wanted signals. These so-called third order distortion products tend to dominante the non-linear distortion of narrowband systems.
