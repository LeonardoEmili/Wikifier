However, this gives a different rule for multiplying permutations. This convention is commonly used in the permutation group literature, but this article uses the convention where the rightmost permutation is applied first.     Since the composition of two bijections always gives another bijection, the product of two permutations is again a permutation. In two-line notation, the product of two permutations is obtained by rearranging the columns of the second permutation so that its first row is identical with the second row of the first permutation. The product can then be written as the first row of the first permutation over the second row of the modified second permutation. For example, given the permutations,   : P \\begin1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\end\\quad \\text \\quad Q \\begin1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\end,   the product QP is:   : QP \\begin1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\end\\begin1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\end \\begin 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\\\ 4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\end \\begin1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\end \\begin1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\end.     The composition of permutations, when they are written in cyclic form, is obtained by juxtaposing the two permutations and then simplifying to a disjoint cycle form if desired. Thus, in cyclic notation the above product would be given by:   : Q \\cdot P \\cdot .     Since ": null

Therefore, products of two or more permutations are usually written without adding parentheses to express grouping; they are also usually written without a dot or other sign to indicate multiplication .         The identity permutation, which maps every element of the set to itself, is the neutral element for this product. In two-line notation, the identity is   : \\begin1 & 2 & 3 & \\cdots & n \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & \\cdots & n\\end.   In cyclic notation, e ... which by convention is also denoted by just or even .

To obtain the inverse of a single cycle, we reverse the order of its elements. Thus,   : ^ .     To obtain the inverse of a product of cycles, we first reverse the order of the cycles, and then we take the inverse of each as above. Thus,   : ^^ .
