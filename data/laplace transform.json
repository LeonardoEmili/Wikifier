These types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplaces attention in 1782 where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations.  However, in 1785, Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than just looking for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form   : \\int x^s \\varphi \\, dx,   akin to a ": null
