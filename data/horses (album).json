According to Smith, Horses was a conscious attempt to make a record that would make a certain type of person not feel alone. People who were like me, different  ... I wasnt targeting the whole world. I wasnt trying to make a hit record.  Recording sessions for the album were marked by frequent arguments between Smith and Cale, owing in part to their different work ethics. By the end of recording, and for some years immediately following the albums release, Smith was quick to downplay Cales contributions and suggested that she and her band ignored his suggestions entirely. In a 1976 interview with  Rolling Stone , Smith described the experience:             Cale would later recall that Smith initially struck him as someone with an incredibly volatile mouth who could handle any situation , and that as producer on Horses he wanted to capture the energy of her live performances, noting that there was a lot of power in Pattis use of language, in the way images collided with one another.  He described their working relationship during recording as confrontational and a lot like an immutable force meeting an immovable object . Smith herself would later attribute much of the tension between herself and Cale to her inexperience with formal studio recording, recalling that she was very, very suspicious, very guarded and hard to work with and made it difficult for him to do some of the things he had to do . She expressed gratitude for Cales persistence in recording and producing the band, noting that he would always leave much of the bands adolescent and honest flaws in and ultimately helped us in the birth of ourselves , calling him like a brother to me, a brother who gave me a helping hand.
