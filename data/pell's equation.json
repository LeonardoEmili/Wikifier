The negative Pell equation is given by     : x^2 - ny^2 -1     It has also been extensively studied; it can be solved by the same method of continued fractions and will have solutions if and only if the period of the continued fraction has odd length. However it is not known which roots have odd period lengths and therefore not known when the negative Pell equation is solvable. A necessary condition for solvability is that n is not divisible by 4 or by a prime of form 4k  +  3. This is because the Pell equation implies that −1 is a ": null
