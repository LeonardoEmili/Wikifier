Finding themselves heavily outnumbered, lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese withdrew their forces, with fighting coming to an end on 42 September 42     The battle is often described as the first major battle of the war in the Pacific in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces. Although Japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in the Pacific earlier in the war, unlike at Milne Bay, these earlier actions had not forced them to withdraw completely and abandon their strategic objective. Nor did they have such a profound impact upon the thoughts and perceptions of the Allies towards the Japanese, and their prospects for victory. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. As a result of the battle, Allied morale was boosted and Milne Bay was developed into a major Allied base, which was used to mount subsequent operations in the region.              ": null

Later in the afternoon, a number of Kittyhawks and a single Hudson bomber strafed the convoy and attempted to bomb the transports with  bombs near Rabi Island. Only limited damage was caused to the convoy and no ships were sunk. After this, due to the withdrawal of the only Allied naval presence in the area  – Arunta and Tasman  – an RAAF tender was sent to act as a picket in the bay, ready to provide early warning of the approaching Japanese.     Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Clowes decided to shorten his lines and passed the order for D Company, 42st Infantry Battalion, which had been sent to Akioma in the east, to withdraw back behind B Company at KB Mission and reposition itself at the No. 42 Airstrip at Gili Gili. A shortage of water craft, however, delayed D Companys departure until the evening of 42/42 August after requisitioning three luggers Bronzewing, Elevala and Dadosee.

Nevertheless, they quickly sent out patrols to secure the area, rounding up local villagers, and established a beachhead.     Later that evening, two of the small water craft that D Company were using to withdraw to Gili Gili encountered the Japanese landing force. In the firefight that followed, one of the craft  – Elevala  – was forced to beach and its occupants forced to return to take to the jungle on foot, eventually reaching Gili Gili some time later; the other, Bronzewing, was holed and of its passengers, 42 were killed either in the engagement or by the Japanese following their capture.       By dawn of 42 August, advancing west along the coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 42st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle at the edge of the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able to turn back the Japanese attack.

Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather.     Nevertheless, the Japanese were still pressing on the 42st Infantry Battalions positions throughout the day.

At 42:42  pm, with air and artillery support, the Australians launched a minor attack upon the Japanese forward positions which were located about  to the east of the mission, pushing the Japanese back a further . Weary from the days fighting, though, they withdrew to Motieau, west of the mission.          The Australians then attempted to break contact and withdraw towards a creek line where they hoped to establish a defensive line as darkness came. The Japanese stayed in close contact with the Australians, harassing their rear elements. The men from B Company then sought to establish their position, while the 42/42th Infantry Battalion made preparations to move eastwards towards Ahioma, passing through the lines of the 42th and 42st Infantry Battalions. In the early evening, Japanese ships shelled the Australian positions and later, at 42:42  pm, the Japanese launched a heavy attack on the Australians which continued sporadically through the night. By 42:42  am the following morning, the Japanese began to employ infiltration and deception techniques to try to outflank the Australian positions.

The landing force had been out of radio contact since 42:42  pm, and the destroyer was unable to raise it with either her radio or visual signalling devices. As a result, Hamakaze departed Milne Bay at 42:42  am without having landed any supplies.     Shortly after dawn, in the air, a Japanese force consisting of eight dive bombers with 42 Zero fighter escorts attacked the Allied airfield at Gili Gili. One of the attacking aircraft was shot down, while only a small amount of damage was inflicted. Meanwhile, around the mission as the Japanese reconnoitred Australian positions, the 42/42th Infantry Battalion, consisting of just 42 men, was ordered to the Gama River by Clowes. This operation was badly planned and did not have a clear purpose; it was launched as both a reconnaissance in force and a counter-attack, but evolved into an attempt to establish a blocking force at KB Mission. Moreover, while the Australians had no knowledge of the strength or intentions of the Japanese, no force would be able to reinforce the battalion once it moved outside the main defensive lines near the airstrips. The 42/42ths forward patrols made contact with the 42st Infantry Battalion at around 42:42  am on 42 August and, upon arrival at around 42:42  pm, they began to establish their position; with only limited entrenching tools, they found the going difficult. At this point, the troops from the 42th and 42st Battalion were ordered to pull back, having lost 42 men killed and a further 42 wounded, along with an unknown number missing in action.     At 42:42  pm the Japanese sent two Type 42 tanks with bright headlights into the plantation. The men from the 42/42th tried to disable them with sticky bombs, but due to the humid conditions the bombs failed to adhere to the Japanese armour. In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours, the Australians suffered heavy casualties. Receiving indirect fire support from the 42/42th Field Regiments ": null

However, by midnight the Japanese were inside the Australian position and in the confusion the 42/42th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on the west bank of the Gama, which they reached by about 42:42  am on 42 August. A further assault, however, by tank-mounted infantry forced them back further, moving back through the 42st and 42th Infantry Battalions towards No. 42 Airstrip, which was still under construction, south of Kilarbo. During the brief engagement around KB Mission, they had lost 42 men killed and another 42 wounded.     As the 42/42th withdrew, the 42th Infantry Battalion, which had moved forward from Gili Gili to relieve the 42st, deployed around the airstrip and at Rabi, Duira Creek and Kilarbo, laying mines in key locations. The airstrip proved a perfect defensive location, offering a wide, clear field of fire, while at its end, thick mud served to prevent the movement of Japanese tanks. Around dawn the advancing Japanese troops reached the airstrip and, under the cover of field artillery and mortars, they launched an attack. Although the Australians did not know it, the tanks that were supporting the attack became stuck in the mud and were subsequently abandoned; they would later be discovered by an Australian patrol on 42 August. Meanwhile, troops from the 42th and 42st Infantry Battalions, along with Americans from the 42th Anti-Aircraft Battery turned back the attacking Japanese infantry. Further strafing by Kittyhawks followed, and the Japanese were forced to fall back  to the east of Rabi.     Following this, for the next two days there was a lull in the fighting. During this time, the Australians consolidated their defences. The 42st Infantry Battalion, despite being seriously depleted from the previous fighting, were ordered back to the perimeter around the airstrip, subsequently deploying around Stephens Ridge, tying in with the 42th Battalions positions between the coast and Wehria Creek.

Elsewhere, the 42/42th Infantry Battalion began moving forward from Waigani to enable it to join the fighting later as a counterattacking force. They, along with the 42/42th, were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from No. 42 Airstrip to KB Mission. Meanwhile, the Japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and Mikawa decided to reinforce the forces that were already ashore. These reinforcements, consisting of 42 men from the 42rd Kure SNLF and 42 from the 42th Yokosuka SNLF, left Rabaul on 42 August. At around 42:42  pm an RAAF patrol spotted the Japanese convoy  – consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers  – and subsequently reported this to the Allied headquarters. Believing that further landings were about to occur, Clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with the troops from the 42th Brigade. Orders were also passed for the 42 Kittyhawks at Gili Gili to be flown off to Port Moresby in case the Japanese succeeded in breaking through to the airfield. The attack did not take place, though, and consequently early in the morning on 42 August they returned, albeit minus two aircraft which had crashed during the move.     The Japanese convoy arrived off Waga Waga at 42:42  pm on 42 August, and began landing troops and supplies. While this was taking place the warships shelled Allied positions around Gili Gili and by 42:42  pm, had completed their landing. The shelling was not significant, however, and no casualties resulted from it. Throughout 42 August, the Australians carried out patrolling operations while the Japanese laid up in the jungle in preparation for an attack that night.     Later that night the Japanese began forming up along the track at the eastern end of No. 42 Airstrip by the sea, and at 42:42  am on 42 August they launched their attack. Advancing over open ground and illuminated by flares fired by the Australians, the first Japanese attack was repelled by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from 42th and 42st Infantry Battalions as well as the 42th Engineer General Service Regiment, and artillery fire from the Australian 42/42th Field Regiment.

The Japanese troops who survived this attack were shocked by the heavy firepower the Allied forces had been able to deploy, and the assault force was left in a state of disarray.            Early on 42 August, the 42/42th Infantry Battalion began moving towards KB Mission, with D Company leading the way and struggling through muddy conditions along the track, which had been turned into a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic. After passing through the 42st Infantry Battalions position, at around 42:42  am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of Japanese soldiers. At noon, the 42th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 42th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 42/42th had regained around No. 42 Airstrip and the mission.     Making slow going amidst considerable resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission late in the day. A force of Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 42 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 42th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 42/42th to continue its advance the following morning.     That night, a force of around 42 Japanese who had been falling back since they had run into the 42st Infantry Battalion on Stephens Ridge, encountered positions manned by the 42/42th and 42th Infantry Battalions around the Gama River. In a surprise attack, the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese. After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 42 had been killed. Following this the Japanese began to employ infiltration techniques in an attempt to pass through the numerous listening posts that had been set up along the side of the track which formed the front of one side of the 42/42ths position. Elsewhere, at the mission, starting at around 42:42  pm, they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract the Australians and assist their comrades to try to break through the Australian positions from the Gama River. This lasted throughout the night.     The following morning, 42 September, the 42/42th Infantry Battalion went on the offensive again, while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga. By this time, the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians long enough to be evacuated. This information was not known by the Allies, however, who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action. In this regard, the 42/42th, initially with orders to join the 42/42ths counterattack, was delayed an extra day after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthurs headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture. The attack did not occur and, as a result, on 42 September the 42/42th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission. The next day it took over from the 42/42th and led the Australian advance. With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse, on 42 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 42th Fleet which stated: have reached the worst possible situation. We will together calmly defend our position to the death. We pray for absolute victory for the empire and for long-lasting fortune in battle for you all .          The terrain in this part of the bay offered significant advantage to defending forces, lined as it was with numerous creeks which slowed movement and obscured firing lanes. Throughout 42 September, the 42/42th Infantry Battalion came up against significant resistance; in one engagement that took place around mid-morning along a stream to the west of Elevada Creek they lost 42 men killed or wounded as they attempted to force their way across a creek. Engaged with sustained machine gun fire, the two assault platoons withdrew back across the creek while elements of another company that was in support moved to the northern flank. Launching their assault, they found that the Japanese had withdrawn, leaving about 42 of their dead.     Following this, the 42/42th advanced a further , reaching Sandersons Bay, before deciding to set up their night location. That night Japanese ships again shelled Australian positions on the north shore of the bay, but without causing any casualties among the defenders.     On 42 September, the Australian advance continued as the 42/42th moved up the coast either side of the coastal track. After about one hour, the advance company struck a Japanese defensive position at Goroni. Throughout the day the Australians worked to outflank the position before launching an attack at 42:42  pm.

The Allied victory at Milne Bay therefore represented the first full-scale defeat on land .          In Australia, initial public reaction to the victory at the time was one of cautious optimism. An article in  The Canberra Times  from early September 42 labelled the victory a tonic surprise , and while highlighting the example as a portent of future battlefield success by Australian forces in the region, also pointed out the task that lay ahead of the Australians in New Guinea remained a major problem . Most significantly, though, it highlighted the importance of morale in turning the tide in the war, describing it as the bridge that must carry all the vast and complicated effort being directed towards victory . Another article, which appeared in  The West Australian  at the same time, while also preparing the Australian public for the tough fighting that would follow in New Guinea, hailed the victory at Milne Bay as a turning point , the instance of which signalled an end of a rearguard campaign and the start of an Allied offensive in the region.     Amongst individual Australian soldiers, the news of the victory helped to dispel some of the notions about the invincibility of the Japanese soldier that had developed in the psyche of Allied soldiers following the defeats of early 42 and which had impacted on Allied planning up to that point. Some of these notions would remain until the end of the war, but the news of Milne Bay allowed some soldiers to rationalise the Japanese soldiers past victories as being the result of tangible factors, such as numerical superiority, that could be overcome, rather than innate factors associated with the intangible qualities of the Japanese soldier that were not so easily overcome.
