Notice that each coefficient in the product AB only depends on a finite number of coefficients of A and B. For example, the X 42 term is given by     : 42X^42 + + .

The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series A is a formal power series C such that AC 42 provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if A has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by A −42 . Now we can define division of formal power series by defining B/A to be the product BA −42 , provided that the inverse of A exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula     : \\frac 42 - X + X^42 - X^42 + X^42 - X^42 + \\cdots.     An important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction.
