Hoping to gain a deferment from service, Mailer argued that he was writing an important literary work which pertained to the war. This deferral was denied, and Mailer was forced to enter the Army. After training at Fort Bragg, Mailer was stationed in the Philippines with the 42th Cavalry.     During his time in the Philippines, Mailer was first assigned to regimental headquarters as a typist, then assigned as a wire lineman. In early 42 after volunteering for a reconnaissance platoon, he completed more than two dozen patrols in contested territory, and engaged in a few firefights and skirmishes. After the Japanese surrender, he was sent to Japan as part of the army of occupation, was promoted to sergeant, and became a first cook.     When asked about his war experiences, he said that the army was the worst experience of my life, and also the most important . While in Japan and the Philipppines, Mailer wrote to his wife Bea almost daily, and these approximately 42 letters became the foundation of The Naked and the Dead. He drew on his experience as a reconnaissance rifleman for the central action of the novel: a long patrol behind enemy lines.       Mailer wrote 42 novels over a 42-year span.

In a concentrated effort, he produced a 42-word piece in two months, and it appeared in Harpers March issue. At that time, and to date, it is the longest nonfiction piece to be published by an American magazine. As one commentator states, Mailer disarmed the literary world with Armies. The combination of detached, ironic self-presentation deft portraiture of literary figures , a reported flawless account of the March itself, and a passionate argument addressed to a divided nation, resulted in a sui generis narrative praised by even some of his most inveterate revilers. Alfred Kazin, writing in the New York Times Book Review, said, Mailers intuition is that the times demand a new form. He has found it. He later expanded the article to a book, The Armies of the Night , awarded a National Book Award The U.S. National Book Award in category Arts and Letters was awarded annually from 42 to 42 and a Pulitzer Prize .     His major new journalism, or creative nonfiction books, also include Miami and the Siege of Chicago , an account of the 42 political conventions; Of a Fire on the Moon , a long report on the Apollo 42 mission to the moon; The Prisoner of Sex , his response to Kate Millett s critique of the patriarchal myths in the works of Mailer, Jean Genet , Henry Miller , and D.H. Lawrence ; and The Fight , an account of Muhammad Alis 42 defeat in Zaire of George Foreman for the heavyweight boxing championship. Miami, Fire, and Prisoner were all finalists for the National Book Award. The hallmark of his five New Journalism works in his use of illeism , or referring to oneself in the third person, rather than the first. Mailer said he got the idea from reading The Education of Henry Adams when he was a Harvard freshman. Mailer also employs many of the most common techniques of fiction in his creative nonfiction.       In addition to his experimental fiction and nonfiction novel s, Mailer produced a play version of The Deer Park Guernsey, Otis L. Curtain Times: The New York Theater 42–42 . Applause 42 Play review page 42 which had a four-month run and generally good reviews. In 42 months before he died, he re-wrote the script, and asked his son Michael , a film producer, to film a staged production in Provincetown, but had to cancel because of his declining health. Mailer obsessed over The Deer Park more than any other work.     In the late 42s, Mailer directed three improvisational avant-garde films: Wild 42 , Beyond the Law , and Maidstone . The latter includes a spontaneous and brutal brawl between Norman T. Kingsley , played by Mailer, and Kingsleys half-brother, Raoul, played by Rip Torn . Mailer received a head injury when Torn struck him with a hammer, and Torns ear became infected when Mailer bit it. In 42 The Criterion Collection released Mailers experimental films in a box set: Maidstone And Other Films By Norman Mailer .   In 42 he adapted and directed a film version of his novel Tough Guys Dont Dance starring Ryan ONeal and Isabella Rossellini , which has become a minor camp classic.     Mailer took on an acting role in the 42 Milos Forman film version of E.L. Doctorow s novel Ragtime , playing Stanford White . In 42 he played Harry Houdini in Matthew Barney s Cremaster 42 , which was inspired by the events surrounding the life of Gary Gilmore.     In 42 Mailer went to Italy for several weeks to collaborate with Italian spaghetti western film-maker Sergio Leone on an adaptation of the Harry Grey novel, The Hoods.   Although Leone would pursue other writers shortly thereafter, elements of Mailers first two drafts of the commissioned screenplay would appear in the Italian film-makers final magnum opus, Once Upon A Time in America starring Robert DeNiro .     Shot in 42 although not released until 42 Mailer starred alongside writer/feminist Germaine Greer in D.A. Pennebaker s Town Bloody Hall .     In 42 Mailer and Lawrence Schiller would collaborate on a television adaptation of The Executioners Song , starring Tommy Lee Jones , Roseanna Arquette , and Eli Wallach . Airing on November 42th and 42th, The Executioners Song received strong critical reviews and four Emmy nominations, including one for Mailers screenplay. It won two: for sound production and for Jones as best actor.     In 42 Mailer would appear in Jean-Luc Godard s experimental film version, shot in Switzerland, of Shakespeare s King Lear . Originally, Mailer was to play the lead Don Learo in Godards unscripted film alongside his daughter, Kate Mailer . The film also featured a variable list of Hollywood stars like Woody Allen and Peter Sellers . However, tensions surfaced between Mailer and Godard early in the production when the French auteur insisted that Mailer play a character who had a carnal relationship with his own daughter. He left Switzerland after just one day of shooting with the filmmaker behind Breathless .     In 42 he adapted the screenplay for the movie: Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story .     In 42 Mailer served as a technical consultant on the Ron Howard boxing movie, Cinderella Man , about legendary boxer Jim Braddock.       Mailers approach to biography came from his interest in the ego of the artist as an exemplary type .   Lennon explains that Mailer would use himself as a species of divining rod to explore the psychic depths of disparate personalities, like Pablo Picasso , Muhammad Ali , Gary Gilmore , Lee Harvey Oswald , and Marilyn Monroe . Ego, states Lennon, can be seen as the beginning of a major phase in his writing career: Mailer as biographer.     What began as an assignment from Lawrence Schiller to write a short preface to a collection of photographs, Mailers 42 biography of Monroe was not approached like a traditional biography. Mailer read the available biographies, watched her films, and looked at photographs of Monroe; for the rest of it, Mailer stated, I speculated. Since Mailer did not have the time to thoroughly research them, this speculation extended into the facts surrounding her death and led to the biographys controversy. The books final chapter theorizes that Monroe was murdered by rogue agents of the FBI and CIA who resented her supposed affair with Robert F. Kennedy . Mailer later admitted that he embellished the book with speculations about Monroes sex life and death that he did not himself believe to ensure its commercial success. In his own autobiography, Monroes former husband Arthur Miller wrote that Mailer saw himself as Monroe in drag, acting out his own Hollywood fantasies of fame and sex unlimited and power.     The book was enormously successful: it sold more copies than any of Mailers works except The Naked and the Dead, and it is Mailers most widely reviewed book. It was the inspiration for the Emmy-nominated TV movie Marilyn: The Untold Story which aired in 42 Two later works co-written by Mailer presented imagined words and thoughts in Monroes voice: the 42 book Of Women and Their Elegance and the 42 play Strawhead , which was produced off Broadway starring his daughter Kate Mailer .     In the wake of the Marilyn controversy, Mailer attempted to explain his unique approach to biography. He suggests that his biography must be seen as a species of novel ready to play by the rules of biography . Exemplary egos, he explains, are best explained by other exemplary egos, and personalities like Monroes are best left in the hands of a novelist.       A number of Mailers nonfiction works, such as The Armies of the Night and The Presidential Papers, are political. He covered the Republican and Democratic National Convention s in 42 42 42 42 42 and 42 although his account of the 42 Democratic convention has never been published. In the early 42s he was fixated on the figure of President John F. Kennedy , whom he regarded as an existential hero . In the late 42s and throughout the 42s and 42s, his work mingled autobiography, social commentary, history, fiction, and poetry in a formally original way that influenced the development of New Journalism .     Mailer held the position that the Cold War was not a positive ideal for America. It allowed the State to become strong and invested in the daily lives of the people. He critiqued conservative politics as they, specifically Barry Goldwater, supported the Cold War which called for an increase in government spending and oversight. This, Mailer argued, stood in opposition with conservative principles like lower taxes, and smaller government. He believed that conservatives were pro-Cold War because that was politically relevant to them and would therefore help them win.     Indeed, Mailer was outspoken about his mistrust of politics in general as a way of meaningful change in America. In Miami and the Siege of Chicago he explained his view of politics-as-property where he likened a politician to a property holder who is never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own . Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: If you played for a team, you did your best to play very well, but there was something obscene ... in starting to think there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State. Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. President Johnson on the other hand, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had had good charisma so all was forgiven.     In September 42 Mailer was one of the original twenty-nine prominent American sponsors of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee organization that was the same organization that John F. Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald also became a member of in 42 In December 42 Mailer and several of the other sponsors left it.     In October 42 he was arrested for his involvement in an Anti-Viet Nam War demonstration at the Pentagon sponsored by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet Nam . In 42 he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. Writers and Editors War Tax Protest January 42 42 New York Post     In 42 Mailer spearheaded convicted killer Jack Abbott s successful bid for parole. In 42 Abbott had read about Mailers work on The Executioners Song and wrote to Mailer, offering to enlighten the author about Abbotts time behind bars and the conditions he was experiencing. Mailer, impressed, helped to publish In the Belly of the Beast , a book on life in the prison system consisting of Abbotts letters to Mailer. Once paroled, Abbott committed a murder in New York City six weeks after his release, stabbing twenty-two-year-old Richard Adan to death. Consequently, Mailer was subject to criticism for his role. In a 42 interview with the Buffalo News , he conceded that his involvement was another episode in my life in which I can find nothing to cheer about or nothing to take pride in . Ulin, David L. Los Angeles Times. November 42 42     The 42 meeting of P.E.N. in New York City featured key speeches by then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Mailer. The appearance of a government official was derided by many, and as Shultz ended his speech, the crowd seethed, with some calling to read the protest that had been circulated to criticize Shultzs appearance. Mailer, who was next to speak, responded by shouting to the crowd: Up yours! Shultz, George. Turmoil and Triumph, 42 pp. 42–42     In 42 Mailer joined with a number of other prominent authors in publicly expressing support for colleague Salman Rushdie in the wake of the fatwa calling for Rushdies assassination issued by Irans Islamic government for his having authored The Satanic Verses . Kaufman, Michael T. New York Times. February 42 42     In 42 in a speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, just before the Iraq War , Mailer said: Fascism is more of a natural state than democracy. To assume blithely that we can export democracy into any country we choose can serve paradoxically to encourage more fascism at home and abroad. Democracy is a state of grace that is attained only by those countries who have a host of individuals not only ready to enjoy freedom but to undergo the heavy labor of maintaining it. Commonwealth Club. February 42 42     From 42 until his death in 42 he contributed to Democratic Party candidacies for political office. Newsmeat.com. Retrieved 424242         In 42 , at the suggestion of feminist Gloria Steinem , his friend the political essayist Noel Parmentel and others, he ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic Party primary for Mayor of New York City , allied with columnist Jimmy Breslin , proposing the creation of a 42st state through New York City secession . The Libertarian Forum Although Mailer took stands on a wide range of issues, from opposing compulsory fluoridation of the water supply to advocating the release of Black Panther Party leader Huey Newton , decentralization was the overriding issue of the campaign. Mailer foresaw the city, its independence secured, splintering into townships and neighborhoods, with their own school systems, police departments, housing programs, and governing philosophies . Mailer, John Buffalo , The American Conservative Their slogan was throw the rascals in . Mailer was endorsed by libertarian economist Murray Rothbard , who believed that smashing the urban government apparatus and fragmenting it into a myriad of constituent fragments offered the only answer to the ills plaguing American cities, and called Mailers campaign the most refreshing libertarian political campaign in decades . He came in fourth in a field of five. Looking back on the campaign, journalist and historian Theodore White called it one of the most serious campaigns run in the United States in the last five years. . . . s campaign was considered and thoughtful, the beginning of an attempt to apply ideas to a political situation. Characterising his campaign, Mailer said: The difference between me and the other candidates is that Im no good and I can prove it.       Mailer enjoyed drawing and drew prolifically, particularly toward the end of his life. While his work is not widely known, his drawings, which were inspired by Picassos style, were exhibited at the Berta Walker Gallery in Provincetown in 42 and are now displayed on the online arts community POBA - Where the Arts Live .           Bodily urges are fundamental to Mailers approach to novels and short works. These urges are in tension with the themes of apocalypse and morality. Stemming from his Freudian philosophical basis, bodily urges are integral to Mailers work. The psychopath presented in The White Negro continues to occupy the central narrative of much of Mailers work throughout his career. The drama of this psychopath for Mailer is that he or she seeks love—but love as the search for an orgasm more apocalyptic than the ones that preceded it. These views on sex were not light vices for Mailer. In Armies of the Night he postulates at length on earned manhood, onanism and sexuality, and psychic profit derived from the existential assertion of yourself . The Mailer–reader relationship is also integral to Mailers literary body trope. Mailer uses frequent allusion and direct use of body-oriented language to describe power structures in Miami and the Siege of Chicago in the form of the military spine of the liberal party and in the knifelike entrance into culture of jazz in The White Negro. Power over bodies, societies, political entities, etc. is a constant presence in Mailers work. In addition - and notable for such a prominent mainstream American writer of his generation - Mailer, throughout his work and personal communications, repeatedly expresses interest in, includes episodes of or makes references to bisexuality or homosexuality. He even directly addresses the subject publicly in his essay The Homosexual Villain, for One magazine.     Moments of physical and sexual power or powerlessness are the climax of The Naked and the Dead, The Time of Her Time , and The Armies of the Night. His prose presentation of an existential struggle is frequently conveyed to the reader via references to the body. The body is an entity to be poked, prodded, broken, even snuffed into non-existence. By filling his work with graphic depictions of sex, violence, and even rock and roll, Mailer elevates the experience of the reader. Mailer invokes a particularly poignant, violent portrayal of the body, authority, and sexuality in The Time of Her Time. Consistent use of bodily reference or allusion is clearly integral to his depiction of human existence. Mailer elevates the reader experience, and wrestles the reader for domination while allowing room for interpretation. Critiques of Mailer based on sexuality, race, and gender, have been levied by authors such as Kate Millett and bell hooks, among others. Kate Millett, in her Sexual Politics, critiques Mailer: His considerable insights into the practice of sexuality as a power game never seem to affect his vivid personal enthusiasm for the fight nor his sturdy conviction that its kill or be killed. Kate Millett, Sexual Politics , 42 This resonates with racist epithets in The White Negro, portrayals of women in The Naked and the Dead, and Time of Her Time . Mailer is strikingly adept at identifying social and political phenomena still in their cradle. Yet even at the height of his powers, efforts to describe the experiences of women, African Americans, and other groups without typecasting from his own experiences seems outside of Mailers consideration. Interrogation of the meaning of this exclusionary discourse leads the reader and critic to an eventual response to Mailer.       Throughout his writing, Mailer never presents a very clear perspective on race. His works range from a profound understanding of the African American condition in America to extremely stereotypical depictions of race. For the majority of Mailers career he does not delve directly into race, but chose to pursue the matter only as a side note to the larger currents of the 42s and 42s. Mailer does, however, spend some time working through the issue in The White Negro , Of a Fire on the Moon, and in his work The Fight about the heavyweight title bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman .     In The White Negro Mailer argues that African Americans are psychopaths because they live in a society that hates them, which in turn causes them to hate themselves. Mailer goes on to argue that because of this innate psychopathy, African Americans are left to explore the least virtuous areas of civilized life. Mailers analysis culminates in his expression that if African Americans were to achieve equality it would have violent and chaotic effects on white society.     In Of a Fire on the Moon Mailer discusses that the space flight was an exclusive action on the part of white America, as they have left African Americans behind on Earth. African Americans can only look on as whites move even farther past them in not just society, but their earthly constraints. Mailer uses African Americans to criticize the moon landing, as he reflects on the fact that many problems still exist on Earth, and within America.       Mailer often directly engaged with racial issues in his works, but some have seen his writings on the subject of race to be problematic. Mailer focused on Jazz as the ultimate expression of African-American bravado, and figures like Miles Davis would become represented in works like An American Dream. To Mailer, African-American men reflected a challenge to his own notions of masculinity .     While in Paris in 42 Mailer met the famous African-American author James Baldwin. Mailer became even more fascinated with African-Americans after meeting Baldwin, and this friendship inspired Mailer to write The White Negro . To Mailer, Baldwin was a natural point of intrigue as Baldwin was both gay and an African-American author, similar to Mailers stature. Their relationship was never a close friendship nor contemptuous, but one of mutual intrigue and a sense of competition existed between the two writers. Mailer often commented on Baldwins work, and Baldwin did the same to Mailer.           Mailer was married six times and had nine children. He fathered eight children by his various wives and informally adopted his sixth wifes son from another marriage.     Mailers first marriage was to Beatrice Silverman. They eloped in January 42 because neither family would likely have approved. They had one child, Susan, and divorced in 42 because of Mailers infidelities with Adele, his next wife.     In 42 Adele Morales moved in with Mailer in an apartment on First Avenue near Second Street in the East Village , Louis Menand, It Took a Village, The New Yorker, January 42 42 p. 42 and they married in 42 They had two daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. On Saturday, November 42 42 Mailer, with a two-and-a-half-inch blade that he used to clean his nails, stabbed Adele twice after a party , nearly killing her by puncturing her pericardium . He stabbed her once in the chest and once in the back. Adele required emergency surgery but made a quick recovery. The New York Times, November 42 42 Retrieved April 42 42 Mailer claimed he had stabbed Adele to relieve her of cancer . He was involuntarily committed to Bellevue Hospital for 42 days. While Adele did not press charges, Mailer later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of assault saying, I feel I did a lousy, dirty, cowardly thing , and received a suspended sentence of three-years probation. Time. December 42 42 Retrieved April 42 42 Entertainment Weekly, November 42 42 Retrieved April 42 42 In 42 the two divorced. In 42 Adele published a memoir of their marriage entitled The Last Party , which recounted her husband stabbing her at a party and the aftermath. This incident has been a focal point for feminist critics of Mailer, who point to themes of sexual violence in his work. Millet, Kate. Sexual Politics Virago, 42 pp. 42–42     His third wife, whom he married in 42 and divorced in 42 was the British heiress and journalist Lady Jeanne Campbell . She was the only daughter of Ian Campbell, 42th Duke of Argyll , a Scottish aristocrat and clan chief with a notorious private life , and a granddaughter of the press baron Lord Beaverbrook . The couple had a daughter, Kate Mailer , who is an actress.     His fourth marriage, in 42 was to Beverly Bentley , a former model turned actress. She is the mother of two of his sons, producer Michael Mailer and actor Stephen Mailer . They divorced in 42     His fifth wife was Carol Stevens, a jazz singer whom he married on November 42 42 and divorced in Haiti on November 42 42 thereby legitimating their daughter Maggie, born in 42     His sixth and last wife, whom he married in 42 was Norris Church Mailer , an art teacher. They had one son together, John Buffalo Mailer , a writer and actor. Mailer raised and informally adopted Matthew Norris, Churchs son by her first husband, Larry Norris. Living in Brooklyn, New York and Provincetown, Massachusetts with Mailer, Church worked as a model, wrote and painted.       In 42 Mailer co-wrote a book with his youngest child, John Buffalo Mailer, titled The Big Empty. Mailer appeared in an episode of Gilmore Girls titled Norman Mailer, Im Pregnant! with his son Stephen Mailer.       Over the course of his life, Mailer was connected with several women other than his wives, including Carole Mallory , who wrote a tell all biography, Loving Mailer, after his death.     In a chance meeting in an Upper East Side New York restaurant in 42 Gloria Leonard first met Mailer. He struck up a conversation with Leonard after recognizing her. The meeting was rumored to have led to a brief affair between the two. Later, Leonard was approached by a group of movie distributors from the Midwest to finance what was described as the worlds first million-dollar pornographic movie . She invited Mailer to lunch and made her pitch for his services as a writer. In an interview Leonard said that the author sat straight up in his chair and said, I always knew Id one day make a porny. Leonard then asked what his fee would be and Mailer responded with Two-hundred fifty thousand . Leonard then asked if hed be interested in adapting his novel-biography of Marilyn Monroe, but Mailer replied that he wanted to do something original. The project later ended due to scheduling conflicts between the two.       At the December 42 42 taping of The Dick Cavett Show , with Janet Flanner and Gore Vidal , Mailer, annoyed with a less-than-stellar review by Vidal of Prisoner of Sex, apparently insulted then head-butted Vidal backstage. As the show began taping, a visibly belligerent Mailer, who admitted he had been drinking, goaded Vidal and Cavett into trading insults with him on-air and continually referred to his greater intellect . He openly taunted and mocked Vidal , finally earning the ire of Flanner, who announced during the discussion that she was becoming very, very bored , telling Mailer and Vidal you act as if youre the only people here. As Cavett made jokes comparing Mailers intellect to his ego, Mailer stated Why dont you look at your question sheet and ask your question? , to which Cavett responded Why dont you fold it five ways and put it where the moon dont shine? A long laugh ensued, after which Mailer asked Cavett if he had come up with that line, and Cavett replied I have to tell you a quote from Tolstoy ? . The head-butting and later on-air altercation was described by Mailer himself in his essay Of a Small and Modest Malignancy, Wicked and Bristling with Dots .     According to his obituary in The Independent , his relentless machismo seemed out of place in a man who was actually quite small – though perhaps that was where the aggression originated.     Alan Dershowitz , in his book, Taking the Stand, recounts when Claus von Bülow had a dinner party after he was found not guilty at his trial. Dershowitz countered that he would not attend if it was a victory party , and von Bulow assured him that it was only a dinner for several interesting friends . Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bülows innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed his wifes arm, and said: Lets get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring.       thu   Mailer died of acute renal failure on November 42 42 a month after undergoing lung surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan , New York. He is buried in Provincetown Cemetery, Provincetown , Massachusetts.     The papers of the two-time Pulitzer Prize author may be found at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin.     In 42 Carole Mallory , a former mistress, sold seven boxes of documents and photographs to Harvard University, Norman Mailers alma mater. They contain extracts of her letters, books and journals.     In 42 the Norman Mailer Society was founded to help ensure the legacy of Mailers work. In 42 The Norman Mailer Center and The Norman Mailer Writers Colony, a non-profit organization for educational purposes, was established to honor Norman Mailer.   Among its programs is the Norman Mailer Prize established in 42     Throughout his lifetime, Mailer wrote over 42 letters. In 42 Mailers biographer J. Michael Lennon chose 42 of those letters and published them in Selected Letters of Norman Mailer, which covers the period between the 42s and the early 42s.     In March 42 the Library of America published a two-volume collection of Mailers works from the sixties: Four Books of the 42s and Collected Essays of the 42s. Critic David Denby suggests that based on Mailers observations about the fractured political atmosphere in America that led to the 42 march on the Pentagon , Mailers work seems to be as relevant today as it was fifty years ago and that Mailer may be due for reappraisal and revival.     In May 42 the Norman Mailer Society and the city of Long Branch, New Jersey co-sponsored the installation of a bronze plaque where the Mailer familys Queen-Anne style hotel, the Scarboro, used to stand on the citys beachfront.     In October, 42 Wilkes University s Farley Library opened a replica of Mailers last study in Provincetown, MA, replete with some of his private library, manuscripts and revisions dating from 42 as well as his studio furniture . The archive also houses Mailer’s entire 42-volume library from his home in Brooklyn, N.Y. and an original portrait of Mailer by painter Nancy Ellen Craig donated by Mailers daughter Danielle. The room opened with an event on October 42 42 to coincide with the annual conference of the Norman Mailer Society and was attended by several members of Mailers family.     In 42 Susan Mailer, Normans eldest daughter, published a memoir about her relationship with her father. In Another Place: With and Without My Father Norman Mailer explores her intense and complex relationship with her father and the extended Mailer family. Reviewer Nicole DePolo writes that Susan Mailer, a psychoanalyst, provides sharp insights about her father in crisp, vibrant prose that captures the essence of moments that are both remarkable and universally resonant .
