The film opens in a New York police station as a pair of low-lifes from Queens named Johnny B.  and Kamal  are taken into police custody and interrogated by an NYPD detective named Robert Worzic . Worzic demands to know exactly how the pair got into their situation, so Johnny explains that for the past twenty years, he and Kamal frequently entertained themselves by performing prank calls on the telephone. He brings up an early call where he got his neighbor Brett Weir, the local goody-two-shoes kid, in trouble with his mother by impersonating an angry citizen and claiming that Brett has been spitting and cursing.     One day twenty years later , Johnny and Kamal are adults and still performing prank calls, but Johnnys mother Mrs. B  demands that they get jobs. Johnny argues that they get fired from everything they try, even though their reason for termination usually stems from their inability to not insult people over radios and intercoms. Mrs. B compares them to Brett Weir , who has grown to live a very successful life and now owns his own house, and tells them to get out of the house and job-hunt.     Johnny and Kamal decide to head to Mickeys, their local bar, and knock back a few drinks placed on their sizable tab. They happen to meet Brett, who buys them drinks and brags that hes on his way to a meeting at a fancy restaurant. Curious, Johnny calls Bretts new friends at the restaurant as Frank Rizzo and tells the people on the other end that his men Johnny and Kamal have just gotten in from Chicago and need to be cared for. Unbeknownst to the pair, Bretts friends are actually the local Mafia run by Ernie Lazzaro , who is confused and bewildered at Rizzo and his vulgarity but nonetheless gives the boys a limousine ride and a fully comped meal.     Feeling that they have stumbled onto a good job, Johnny calls again as Rizzo the next day and demands another good time for him and Kamal. This time, Lazzaro and his right-hand man Tony Scarboni  introduce the pair to the many Mafia leaders and officials on their payroll. They are given money as an advance on their first assignment: beat up Mickey so the mob can take over his bar and tear it down. At this point, the boys realize what theyre in and that theyre in deep. As they try to convince Mickey  to lay low, Brett recognizes them and reveals to Lazzaro that theyre not mobsters at all. Scarbonis men Geno  and Sonny later grab Johnny and Kamal and takes them to a hot dog-processing plant so that Scarboni can run them through the grinder as punishment. Using their vocal talents, the boys distract their captors and escape. Johnny and Kamal lead Scarboni and his men through the city, crashing a local concert, stealing a cab, and wrecking a nightclub magic show along the way. They eventually make it back to Johnnys house in Queens, only to get arrested by Worzic for all the trouble they caused.     Returning to the present situation, Johnny and Kamal insist to Worzic that everything was just a big misunderstanding and try to tell him of Lazzaros many rackets in the city. Worzic, however, only cares about Frank Rizzo  and throws the boys in a jail cell. They are each given one phone call: Johnny calls his mother, who is threatened by Scarboni to tell them where he is, while Kamal calls a local demolition crew. They are later released on bail and picked up by Scarbonis men so that they can take them to Lazzaro and Scarboni, who are now fitting Mrs. B with cement shoes. Johnny insists that Frank Rizzo can set everything straight and calls his house, where he had previously set up a tape-recording of Rizzo to play on the answering machine. Though it seems to work well enough to make Lazzaro brag about his operation, Brett sees through the deception and the rest of the mob chase after the boys and Mrs. B.     Barely making it back to Queens, Johnny and Kamal immediately call Worzic and tells them that they have taped evidence to incriminate Lazzaro. Instead, the detective is revealed to be on the take and joins Lazzaro in chasing the boys, but they are distracted when Lazzaro recognizes the next-door neighbor Uncle Freddie  as a Mafia boss from long ago. This gives the boys the chance to escape downtown and call every news outlet they can think of with their evidence that exposes Lazzaro. They credit Frank Rizzo as the informant, who in turn credits Johnny and Kamal as The Jerky Boys .     Lazzaro, Scarboni, Worzic, and all their accomplices are arrested, while Johnny and Kamal are made heroes and given a cushy office job in a high-rise building.
