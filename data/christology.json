Beginning with 1:23, Matthew shows a clear interest in identifying Jesus as God with us and in later developing the Emmanuel characterization of Jesus at key points throughout the rest of his Gospel. Matthews Emmanuel by David D. Kupp 1997 pp. 220–24 The name Emmanuel does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on it in Matthew 28:20 to indicate Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age. Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 p. 17 According to Ulrich Luz , the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages. The theology of the Gospel of Matthew by Ulrich Luz 1995 p. 31         The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provides a rich background for Christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the Pauline Epistles . Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 p. 106     A central element in the Christology presented in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan . New Testament christology by Frank J. Matera 1999 p. 67 In this view, as in Acts 2:23 , the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the lawless is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God. The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns by Marion L. Soards 1994 p. 34     Pauls Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term the cross of Christ used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels. Christology by Hans Schwarz 1998 pp 132–34 For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences, as in Cor 2:8. In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death , died at the right time based on the plan of God. For Paul, the power of the cross is not separable from the resurrection of Jesus.           The threefold office  of Jesus Christ is a Christian doctrine based upon the teachings of the Old Testament. It was described by Eusebius and more fully developed by John Calvin . It states that Jesus Christ performed three functions in his earthly ministry  – those of prophet , priest , and king . In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be indicated by anointing him or her by pouring oil over the head. Thus, the term messiah, meaning anointed one , is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently associated with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the Book of Hebrews .

Elwell, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, Second Edition , 736. Strong Protestant reaction against Roman Catholic Marian devotion and teaching has been a significant issue for ecumenical dialogue.

Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger expressed this sentiment about Roman Catholic Mariology when in two separate occasions he stated, The appearance of a truly Marian awareness serves as the touchstone indicating whether or not the Christological substance is fully present Communio , 1996, Volume 23, p. 175 and It is necessary to go back to Mary, if we want to return to the truth about Jesus Christ.
