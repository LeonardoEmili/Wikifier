The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.     An equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.     To prove that it follows from the original form, let A be a ": null
