According to addiction researcher Martin A. Plant, many people go through a period of self-redefinition before initiating recreational drug use. They tend to view using drugs as part of a general lifestyle that involves belonging to a subculture that they associate with heightened status and the challenging of social norms. Plant says, “From the users point of view there are many positive reasons to become part of the milieu of drug taking. The reasons for drug use appear to have as much to do with needs for friendship, pleasure and status as they do with unhappiness or poverty. Becoming a drug taker, to many people, is a positive affirmation rather than a negative experience.”              ": null

Severity and type of risks that come with recreational drug use vary widely with the drug in question and the amount being used. There are many factors in the environment and within the user that interact with each drug differently. Overall, some studies suggest that alcohol is one of the most dangerous of all recreational drugs; only heroin, crack cocaine, and methamphetamines are judged to be more harmful. However, studies which focus on a moderate level of alcohol consumption have concluded that there can be substantial health benefits from its use, such as decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and cognitive decline.     This claim has been disputed. Researcher ": null

        " stated that these studies showing benefits for moderate alcohol consumption lacked control for the variable of what the subjects were drinking, beforehand.  Experts in the UK have suggested that some drugs that may be causing less harm, to fewer users , include cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, and ecstasy. These drugs are not without their own particular risks.           The concept of responsible drug use is that a person can use drugs recreationally or otherwise with reduced or eliminated risk of negatively affecting other aspects of ones life or other peoples lives. Advocates of this philosophy point to the many well-known artists and intellectuals who have used drugs, experimentally or otherwise, with few detrimental effects on their lives. Responsible drug use becomes problematic only when the use of the substance significantly interferes with the users daily life.     Responsible drug use advocates that users should not take drugs at the same time as activities such as driving, swimming, operating machinery, or other activities that are unsafe without a sober state. Responsible drug use is emphasized as a primary prevention technique in harm-reduction drug policies. Harm-reduction policies were popularized in the late 1980s, although they began in the 1970s counter-culture, when cartoons explaining responsible drug use and the consequences of irresponsible drug use were distributed to users.  Another issue is that the illegality of drugs in itself also causes social and economic consequences for those using them—the drugs may be cut with adulterants and the purity varies wildly, making overdoses more likely—and legalization of drug production and distribution would reduce these and other dangers of illegal drug use.  Harm reduction seeks to minimize the harm that can occur through the use of various drugs, whether legal , or illegal . For example, people who take drugs intravenously can minimize harm to both themselves and members of the community through proper injecting technique, using new needles and syringes each time, and proper disposal of all injecting equipment.       In efforts to curtail recreational drug use, governments worldwide introduced several laws prohibiting the possession of almost all varieties of recreational drugs during the 20th century.

One in four adolescents has used an illegal drug and one in ten of those adolescents who need addiction treatment get some type of care.  School-based programs are the most commonly used method for drug use education despite the success rates of these intervention programs this success is highly dependent on the commitment of participants.                    Alcohol is the most widely used drug in Australia.  86.2% of Australians aged 12 years and over have consumed alcohol at least once in their lifetime, compared to 34.8% of Australians aged 12 years and over who have used cannabis at least once in their lifetime.         In the 1960s, the number of Americans who had tried cannabis at least once increased over twentyfold.

Despite acknowledgement that drug use was greatly growing among Americas youth during the late 1960s, surveys have suggested that only as much as 4% of the American population had ever smoked marijuana by 1969.  Jennifer Robison, Gallup.com, 2 July 2002, Accessed 13 November 2013 By 1972, however, that number would increase to 12%. That number would then double by 1977.     The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classified marijuana along with heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug, i.e., having the relatively highest abuse potential and no accepted medical use. Most marijuana at that time came from Mexico, but in 1975 the Mexican government agreed to eradicate the crop by spraying it with the herbicide paraquat, raising fears of toxic side effects. Colombia then became the main supplier. The zero tolerance climate of the Reagan and Bush administrations resulted in passage of strict laws and mandatory sentences for possession of marijuana and in heightened vigilance against smuggling at the southern borders.

After over a decade of decreasing use, marijuana smoking began an upward trend once more in the early 1990s, especially among teenagers, but by the end of the decade this upswing had leveled off well below former peaks of use.
