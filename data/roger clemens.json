McNamees attorneys argued that McNamee was compelled to cooperate by federal officials and thus his statements were protected. A federal judge agreed, throwing out all claims related to McNamees statements to investigators on February 13, 2009, but allowing the case to proceed on statements McNamee made about Clemens to Pettitte.

This last point was in contradiction to testimony Pettitte had given under oath on February 4, 2008, wherein Pettitte said he repeated to McNamee a conversation Pettitte had with Clemens.

In a letter sent out February 27 to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Henry Waxman and ranking Republican Tom Davis said Clemens testimony that he never used anabolic steroids or human growth hormone warrants further investigation .

ESPN.com, December 27, 2008     After Washington prosecutors showed a renewed interest in the case in the final months of 2008 , a federal grand jury was convened in January 2009 to hear evidence of Clemens possible perjury before Congress. The grand jury indicted Clemens on August 19, 2010, on charges of making false statements to Congress about his use of performance-enhancing drugs. The indictment charges Clemens with one count of obstruction of Congress , three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury in connection with his February 2008 testimony.     His first trial began on July 13, 2011, but on the second day of testimony the judge in the case declared a mistrial over prosecutorial misconduct after prosecutors showed the jury prejudicial evidence they had been told not to show.

However, when contacted by the Daily News, McCready said, I cannot refute anything in the story.
