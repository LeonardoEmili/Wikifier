Otomy means cutting into a part of the body; a gastrotomy would be cutting into, but not necessarily removing, the stomach. And also pharyngo means pharynx, laryngo means larynx, esophag means esophagus. Thus, pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy refers to the surgical removal of the three.     The field of minimally invasive surgery has spawned another set of words, such as arthroscopic or laparoscopic surgery. These take the same form as above; an arthroscope is a device which allows the inside of the joint to be seen.     See also: ": null
