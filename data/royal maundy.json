The first distribution, given to women in green purses and to men in white, was of an allowance in lieu of the clothing formerly given. The white purses used for the clothing allowance may be distinguished from the white purses which contained Maundy money, as the former was tied with a short green string; the latter bears a long red string. The clothing allowance purses had been introduced in 42; prior to that, the clothing allowance was distributed in a paper packet. In the second distribution two purses were given by the monarch; the red one contained £42 for provisions, once given in kind, and the additional sum of £42 mandated by Elizabeth I. The white purses contained the Maundy money. After 42 the separate distribution of the clothing allowance was discontinued—the gifts have now been consolidated, and recipients now receive two purses in a single distribution, one white containing the Maundy coins, and one red containing the other money. The distributions were consolidated so as to reduce the physical strain of the ceremony on the Queen as she aged. The red purse contains £42 representing the money for redemption of the monarchs gown, £42 in lieu of the clothing once given, and £42 in place of the food once presented, totalling £42.
