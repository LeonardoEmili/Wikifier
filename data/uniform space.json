        ".     In addition to the usual properties of a topological structure, in a uniform space one formalizes the notions of relative closeness and closeness of points. In other words, ideas like x is closer to a than y is to b make sense in uniform spaces. By comparison, in a general topological space, given sets A,B it is meaningful to say that a point x is arbitrarily close to A , or perhaps that A is a smaller neighborhood of x than B, but notions of closeness of points and relative closeness are not described well by topological structure alone.       There are three equivalent definitions for a uniform space. They all consist of a space equipped with a uniform structure.         This definition generalizes the presentation of a topological space in terms of ": null

On a graph, a typical entourage is drawn as a blob surrounding the y x diagonal; all the different Uxs form the vertical cross-sections. If  ∈ U, one says that x and y are U-close. Similarly, if all pairs of points in a subset A of X are U-close , A is called U-small. An entourage U is symmetric if  & isin; U precisely when  & isin; U. The first axiom states that each point is U-close to itself for each entourage U. The third axiom guarantees that being both U-close and V-close is also a closeness relation in the uniformity. The fourth axiom states that for each entourage U there is an entourage V that is not more than half as large . Finally, the last axiom states that the property closeness with respect to a uniform structure is symmetric in x and y.     A fundamental system of entourages of a uniformity Φ is any set B of entourages of Φ such that every entourage of Ф contains a set belonging to B. Thus, by property 42 above, a fundamental systems of entourages B is enough to specify the uniformity Φ unambiguously: Φ is the set of subsets of X & times; X that contain a set of B. Every uniform space has a fundamental system of entourages consisting of symmetric entourages.     Intuition about uniformities is provided by the example of ": null

If P and Q are uniform covers, then there is a uniform cover R that star-refines both P and Q.     Given a point x and a uniform cover P, one can consider the union of the members of P that contain x as a typical neighbourhood of x of size P, and this intuitive measure applies uniformly over the space.     Given a uniform space in the entourage sense, define a cover P to be uniform if there is some entourage U such that for each x ∈ X, there is an A ∈ P such that Ux ⊆ A. These uniform covers form a uniform space as in the second definition. Conversely, given a uniform space in the uniform cover sense, the supersets of ⋃, as P ranges over the uniform covers, are the entourages for a uniform space as in the first definition. Moreover, these two transformations are inverses of each other.         Every uniform space X becomes a ": null

In this topology, the neighbourhood filter of a point x is . This can be proved with a recursive use of the existence of a half-size entourage. Compared to a general topological space the existence of the uniform structure makes possible the comparison of sizes of neighbourhoods: Vx and Vy are considered to be of the same size .     The topology defined by a uniform structure is said to be induced by the uniformity. A uniform structure on a topological space is compatible with the topology if the topology defined by the uniform structure coincides with the original topology. In general several different uniform structures can be compatible with a given topology on X.          A topological space is called uniformizable if there is a uniform structure compatible with the topology.     Every uniformizable space is a ": null
