In order not to repeat the mistakes that led to   the destruction of civilization on Earth, a computer, known as the Oversoul, was left as guardian of this planet.     Its main mission was to prevent humans from developing technologies that could make wars a global affair. For that, humans were genetically modified so they could communicate with the Oversoul. The Oversoul uses this connection to make humans quite easily distracted when thinking about forbidden technologies, leading them to forget that train of thought. However, after this long time the Oversoul is beginning to fail, and it chooses a group of humans to return to Earth in search of the Keeper of Earth, in the hopes it will be able to find a way to maintain power over the people on Harmony.     To this end the Oversoul recruits Volemak, father of the protagonist of the story, Nafai. Nafai and Issib, his brother, begin to try and defy the Oversouls capability to override thought. Through this they learn of the danger that it is in. Nafai begins hearing the Oversouls voice in his mind. The first book focuses on the familys eventual betrayal, the taking of the Index, and the downfall of the man Gaballufix, who had been planning to ally the city of Basilica, the home of the main characters and the setting of the first half of the book, with a malignant nation.     Nafai, Elemak and Mebbekew, his older half brothers, Issib and his father Volemak are eventually forced to leave the city. They come back to retrieve the Index of the Oversoul, which allows them to communicate with it directly. Because of Nafais careless blunders and miraculous successes, Elemak, Nafais oldest brother, begins to hate him, a theme that will play out throughout the rest of the saga.

Nafai is a tall, 42-year-old-boy who clearly hears the voice of the Oversoul in his mind. Nafai and his brothers and father are banished from Basilica and are forced into the desert from a cunning plot conceived by Gaballufix. Volemak urges his four sons to go back to Basilica and retrieve the Index . Later Nafai confronts Gaballufix and cuts off his head under the bidding of the Oversoul.     ; Gaballufix: Elemaks oldest brother, son of Hosni by Zdedhnoi, and father of Sevet and Kokor by Rasa. He attempts to ally Basilica with Potokgavan against the Gorayni . More importantly, he tries to draw the city into a war that goes beyond the Oversouls mental blocks, and destroy its traditional female-dominated structure with the help of holographically-disguised soldiers that roam the streets. He sets up a plot to kill Volemak, who opposes him; after Volemak and his sons retreat to the desert, they realize that they need the Index, which is in Gaballufixs possession. He is eventually killed by Nafai, who will agonize over this choice and never really forgive himself for it.     ; Rashgallivak: Steward to the Wetchik fortune. After Volemak embarks on a series of seemingly ill-advised actions, Rashgallavik takes control of the money. Though his intentions are originally good, he is overwhelmed by his own power after first becoming the Wetchik himself and then taking over Gaballufixs position.
