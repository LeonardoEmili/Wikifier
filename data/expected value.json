They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively.

Intuitively, the expectation of a random variable taking values in a countable set of outcomes is defined analogously as the weighted sum of the outcome values, where the weights correspond to the probabilities of realizing that value.

A rigorous definition first defines expectation of a non-negative random variable, and then adapts it to general random variables.     Let X be a non-negative random variable with a countable set of outcomes x_1, x_2, \\ldots, occurring with probabilities p_1, p_2, \\ldots, respectively.
