        ", a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, Thats so wrong. Youre taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story weve done before with other characters. Its so arbitrary and gratuitous, and its disrespectful to the audience.  Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in  The Simpsons Ride , which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all.  In a 2010 interview on  The Howard Stern Show , Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it.      Until 1998, Shearer was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute, however, was resolved and Shearer received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.  The dispute was resolved a month later,  and Shearers pay rose to $250,000 per episode.  After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors received $400,000 per episode.  Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30% pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.  On May 13, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough. Al Jean made a statement from the producers saying the show must go on, but did not elaborate on what might happen to the characters Shearer voiced.  On July 7, 2015, Shearer agreed to continue with the show, on the same terms as the other voice actors.      Le Show and radio work     Since 1983, Shearer has been the host of the public radio comedy/music program  Le Show .
