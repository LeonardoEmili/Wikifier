Each line of the notation contains 64 characters , written in groups of four notes. The basic characters for the seven notes, sa ri ga ma pa dha ni, are seen to be suffixed with the vowels a, i, u ,e. For example, in the place of sa, any one of sa, si, su or se is used. Similarly, in place of ri, any one of ra, ri, ru or re is used. Horizontal lines divide the notation into 7 sections. Each section contains 4 to 7 lines of notation, with a title indicating its musical mode. These modes may have been popular atleast from the 6th century CE and were incorporated into the Indian raga system that developed later.

In pitch bracket notation music is written with melody lines and pitch brackets. Melody lines are like staff lines except they can change pitch by writing pitch brackets on them. Pitch brackets add or subtract scale steps to the melody line. The shape of the bracket , determines the number of scale steps to add. The direction of the bracket, opening or closing, determines whether to add or subtract scale steps. As a result of the mathematical nature of pitch bracket notation, arithmetic and algebra can be directly applied to the notation.
