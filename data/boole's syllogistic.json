All S is P is construed to mean that there is nothing that is both S and not-P ; no S is P , that there is nothing that is both S and P . For example, since there is nothing that is a round square, it is true both that nothing is a round square and purple, and that nothing is a round square and not-purple. Therefore, both universal statements, that all round squares are purple and no round squares are purple are true.     Similarly, the ": null
