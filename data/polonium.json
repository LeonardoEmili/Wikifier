Bart, Katharina . . Reuters. On 27 November 2012 Arafats body was exhumed, and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France, Switzerland and Russia.  On 12 October 2013, The Lancet published the groups finding that high levels of the element were found in Arafats blood, urine, and in saliva stains on his clothes and toothbrush.  The French tests later found some polonium but stated it was from natural environmental origin . Isachenkov, Vadim . Associated Press.
