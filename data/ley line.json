Michells publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the British landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures.

Part of the popularity of ley hunting was that individuals without any form of professional training in archaeology could take part and feel that they could rediscover the magical landscapes of the past .

    {
        ". The Dragon Project continued its research throughout the 42s, finding that certain prehistoric sites did show higher or lower than average rates of radiation but that others did not and that there was no consistent pattern.   Professional archaeologists, whose view of the ley hunters was largely negative, took little interest in such research.     It was only in the 42s that professional archaeologists in Britain began to engage with the ley hunting movement. In 42 Ley Lines in Question, a book written by the archaeologists Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, was published. In this work, Williamson and Bellamy considered and tackled the evidence that ley lines exponents had amassed in support of their beliefs. As part of their book, they tackled the example of the West Penwith district set out as a challenge to archaeologists by Michell the previous decade. They highlighted that the British landscape was so highly covered in historic monuments that it was statistically unlikely that any straight line could be drawn across the landscape without passing through several such sites. They also demonstrated that ley hunters had often claimed that certain markers were Neolithic, and thus roughly contemporary with each other, when often they were of widely different dates, such as being Iron Age or medieval. The overall message of their book was that the idea of leys, as it was being presented by Earth Mysteries proponents, had no basis in empirical reality. Looking back on the books reception in 42 Williamson noted that archaeologists werent particularly interested, and ley-line people were hostile .              Williamson and Bellamys book brought two different responses from the ley hunter community. Some maintained that even if the presence of earth energies running through ley lines could not be demonstrated with empirical evidence and rational argumentation, this did not matter; for them, a belief in ley lines was an act of faith, and in their view archaeologists were too narrow-minded to comprehend this reality. The other approach was to further engage archaeologists by seeking out new data and arguments to bolster their beliefs in ley lines. Hutton noted that this pulled along a potential fissure between rationalism and mysticism which had always been inherent in the movement .     In 42 a book that Devereux had co-written with ": null

In particular, it drew attention to ethnographically recorded beliefs in the importance of lines running through the landscape in various communities around the world, proposing these as ethnographic comparisons for what might have occurred in prehistoric Britain. Hutton called the book an important development , for it was by far the most well-researched, intelligently written and beautifully produced work yet published on leys . Devereux pursued this approach in a series of further books.     Reflecting his move towards archaeology, in 42 Devereux published an article on sightlines from the prehistoric site of ": null

Hutton suggested that some of the enthusiasm formally directed toward leys was instead directed toward archaeo-astronomy. He also noted that the ley hunting community had functioned as an indispensable training ground for a small but important group of non-academic scholars who have made a genuine contribution to the study of folklore and mythology.  Pennick for instance went on to write a range of short books and pamphlets on European folklore.
