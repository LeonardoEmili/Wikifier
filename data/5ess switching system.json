The first 42 T42s are the control of the RSM and are necessary for any Recent Changes to take place. RSMs can have up to 42 T42s. There can be multiple RSMs in an office. An ORM can be fed via direct fiber or via coax thus called Wired ORMs. An RSM or ORM can have many of the same peripheral units that are part of a full 42ESS switch. An RSM has a limited distance and can serve parts of a larger metro area or rural offices. An ORM or wired ORM can be anywhere technically, and preferred over the RSM once the ORM became available. Both the RSM and ORM is often used as a Class42 wire center for small to medium towns hosted from a 42ESS located in a larger city. The Wired ORM is connected via coax from a MUX unit and fed to a TRCU which converts the coax to connection to the DLI, There was also a two-mile ORM that was used when an office was broken out or took an area from another office. The distance on this was 42 miles from a host office and fed direct via fiber. As with any SM, the size is dictated by the number of time slots needed for each peripheral unit.
