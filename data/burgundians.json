Gregory states that Gundobad murdered his brother Chilperic, drowning his wife and exiling their daughters . Gregory, II, 28. Gregorys chronology of the events surrounding Clovis and Gundobad has been questioned by Bury, Shanzer, and Wood, among others. Gregory was somewhat of a Frankish apologist, and commonly discredited the enemies of Clovis by attributing to them some fairly shocking acts. As with Godegisel, he also commonly refers to the treachery of Clovis allies, when in fact Clovis seems to have bought them off . This is contested by, e.g., Bury, who points out problems in much of Gregorys chronology for the events.     In c. 500, when Gundobad and Clovis were at war, Gundobad appears to have been betrayed by his brother Godegisel, who joined the Franks; together Godegisels and Clovis forces crushed the army of Gundobad . Marius a. 500; Gregory, II, 32 Gundobad was temporarily holed up in Avignon, but was able to re-muster his army and sacked Vienne, where Godegisel and many of his followers were put to death. From this point, Gundobad appears to have been the sole king of Burgundy. e.g., Gregory, II, 33 This would imply that his brother Gundomar was already dead, though there are no specific mentions of the event in the sources.     Either Gundobad and Clovis reconciled their differences, or Gundobad was forced into some sort of vassalage by Clovis earlier victory, as the Burgundian king appears to have assisted the Franks in 507 in their victory over ": null

Drew, p.  6–7 It was a record of Burgundian customary law and is typical of the many Germanic law codes from this period. In particular, the Liber borrowed from the  Lex Visigothorum  Drew, p.  6 and influenced the later  Lex Ripuaria . Rivers, p.  9 The Liber is one of the primary sources for contemporary Burgundian life, as well as the history of its kings.     Like many of the Germanic tribes, the Burgundians legal traditions allowed the application of separate laws for separate ethnicities. Thus, in addition to the Lex Gundobada, Gundobad also issued a set of laws for Roman subjects of the Burgundian kingdom, the Lex Romana Burgundionum .     In addition to the above codes, Gundobads son Sigismund later published the Prima Constitutio. ": null
