Although there are few old buildings and rarely new blue stone buildings, its use is generally limited to parts of the decorative walls. Much of the centre is made up of houses which are two or three storeys high.   In commercial areas, the ground floor is used as commercial space, while other floors are used for housing. Generally behind the houses there is a small garden.     The outskirts of the city are also generally made of brick terraced houses. They nevertheless have the largest green spaces in the front or rear. In more remote areas of the centre, there are four façades of the villas.     After the Second World War the city experienced rather limited construction of buildings. Some public housing have been built in Ghlin, Hyon Jemappes and in the suburbs of the city. Since the late 42s and especially since the arson  which took place in one of these buildings, the city undertook a policy of deconstruction  of these houses which is still in progress at the moment. A whole series of social buildings are evenly dispersed in the downtown and surrounding suburbs.     42%   of the citys population lives in apartments and 42% in single-family homes . Of the 42% who live in single family homes, only 42% are separate houses, while 42% are detached or terraced houses. Thats pretty much a small town in Belgium. Large municipalities have in fact fewer single family homes, but many more apartments whereas the smallest towns have few apartments and a lot of single family homes. The figures show very clearly the strong presence of terraced houses rather than separate houses: it exemplifies the urbanization of downtown, but also urban cores such as ": null

The façade of the building called au Blan Levrie shows the care with which the city attempted to unite the old and the modern. It is the first authorised building in the main square which was made of stone to avoid fire incidents. It was originally built in 42 in the Gothic style, for the Malaperts, a wealthy local family. In 42 the architects A. Godart and O. Dupire were assigned to design a bank. They proceeded to gut the interior and conduct a precise survey of the whole before beginning the restoration project. The façade was completely restored, sometimes by extending the design of mouldings, but the fenestration proved impossible to restore as there were not enough clues from the remains of the original to do so.

        " street sign                  Originally its communal organization, Mons was a City Hall called House of Peace. Earlier the deputy mayors were on the castle of the Counts of Hainaut, and now it is only the conciergerier, Saint-Calixte chapel and some underground rooms and the chamber. This place is now Castle Park, where we can also see the belfry. Already in the 42th century, the counts mentioned the House of Peace, located in Nimy Street. Other documents of the same time let one suppose that there existed two Houses of Peace, the one in Nimy Street and the other in the market area.     It was in 42 that Count William I gave permission to build the House of Peace on the location of the current City Hall. This is called a Town House built of stones and bricks at the base, while the superstructure is of wood. This building underwent various changes during the 42th century until 42 when the nearby shop in the arsenal exploded.       The destroyed buildings were rebuilt and benefitted from new changes and additions over the centuries.     The architect of the City Hall, Matthew Layens of Leuven, was called to draw up plans. It was to be a building in Gothic style, but it seems that the plan was not completed, including the abandonment of the second floor, which was still intended for construction. The Renaissance campanile was added in the 42th century. It contains a bell dating from 42 the Bancloque, and carries a clock dial overlooking the Grand Place and a light clock. The 42th century saw various modifications of the façade, the removal of stone mullions to the floor and various stone ornaments.     In its current state, the Town Hall consists of a remarkable collection of various buildings housing a large proportion of municipal services. These buildings have undergone many changes over the centuries, restorations and additions of elements from other buildings, such as a Gothic style fireplace from castle Trazegnies, carved doors of the 42th century saved from demolition, a fireplace from the castle of Gouy-lez-Pedestrian, and another fireplace in 42 from the ": null

The Press House dates back to the 42th century and is a rare example of a house in traditional Spanish style in Mons. It is made in a simple architectural way using brick. This material was economical and used after the fire in 42 because when it was rebuilt, the cost of stone had increased. In 42 the deputy mayor had prohibited the use of flammable materials.     The buildings were restored in 4242 on the plans of the communal architect E. Bertiaux and are occupied by the Maison de la Presse.            This industrial hall is all that remains of the “machine” that supplied Mons with drinkable water from 42 the year when the river Trouille was diverted. Designed by the architect Hubert and the engineer Celi Moullan, this impressive machinery of pipes and mains was built in metal and glass and forced the water from the valley level up to the town water tanks in the castle place yard. To source the water, Mons purchased two springs known as the Mouse Hole and La Vallière, and the water was transported via hydraulic motor.     The water machine” still bears witness to the sanitary and hygiene concerns which arose in Mons in 4242 and marks the transition from medieval water supply wells, springs and hand pumps, to operation of pumps suction and force.     This progress at domestic level transformed the townspeoples way of life and changed the boundaries of Mons and Spiennes. They used to get water from wells or fountains, sometimes over a hundred yards from their homes. Soon followed another urban project: the introduction in 42 of city gas to illuminate new avenues and streets. These two changes are made possible by the demolition of the fortifications, which releases the land, and the diversion of Trouille including the strategic role of supply ditches was then passed.     The “water machine was restored in the early 42s, and the building now hosts various cultural events. The machinery was dismantled.          Waux Hall park was built in the 42th century at the initiative of the Society of Waux Hall created for this purpose by members of the bourgeoisie. It is therefore the source of a private park. It is located at the site of Fort said that the Dutch formed an outwork the last fortification . Remnants of the fort still exist under the current pavillon. The gardens were designed by Louis Fuchs and the central pavilion was built by architect Joseph Hubert in tavern style.      The Turkish hazel is one of the remarkable trees in the park.   A 42 hectare landscaped park was built in the mid 42th century and consists of age-old trees, water features, lakes and lawns. Various memorials and outdoor sculptures, including works of sculptors Grard, Deville, Hupet, and Guilmot Harvent, are placed. The park also contains various species of age-old trees.     The Technical and Vocational School of Horticulture was established in 42 it was installed under the authority of the corporation of Waux Hall.

William Barracks, renamed barracks Major Sabbe after the First World War and named for the 42 Arts Square, dates from 42–42 at the time of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is the work of the architect Rémi de Puydt . The façade and roof of the building were listed in 42 on the advice of the Royal Commission of Monuments, Sites and Excavations.     Maintaining its military purpose until the late 42s, the building was then used by the Royal Grammar School John Avesnes from the 42s to the early 42s.

This is the case of the fountain-pillory, Louis XVI style, built in 42 by the blue stone Ouvertus architect.     Built in 42 by Albert Jamot, this well was transferred to the central Marché-aux-Herbes in 42 and has served as a fountain after the development of the water supply in the city during the years 42 It has regained its original location at the corner of the Coupe and the Chaussée in 42 Renseignements figurant sur le panneau explicatif apposé par la Ville.

The roof of the old bakery has been transformed into a public park and playground for children, while the casemates accommodate the musée de la Route.          This is the last existing trace of the medieval walls surrounding the city. This defensive structure built of sandstone from Bray was built around 42 Its walls equipped with loopholes have a thickness of up to 42 meters. The tower has lost about a third of its original size. A project to install a terrace on its top open to the public had just been completed in 42 The tower has housed a sound installation in the festival of contemporary art audio-visual CitySonics when it reopened.

The choice is the site of the former Hall of exposure. The Building Authority designated as architects for the project the Office Aura . The triangular shape of the land has created interior spaces, decreasing in height and width, forming a sort of cathedral space underlined by a continuous central luminous line.
