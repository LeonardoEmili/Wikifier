About his model Fernandez has been known to comment, Soy de aquí como el coquí I am from here just like the Coquí, a common patriotic axiom that is used to demonstrate their native ties to the island. Although incorrect, many believe that the Coquí and its unique vocalizations are indigenous to the island of Puerto Rico. In fact however, there are thriving populations of Coquís that, like the people of Puerto Rico, have been transported to the island of Hawaii. The Coquí is viewed as an ecological menace in Hawaii where its song of co kee co kee is found to be an irritant by many. Needless to say that efforts to eradicate its presence in Hawaii is not a popular issue among Puerto Ricans.
