It shares borders with the council areas of Aberdeenshire , Argyll and Bute , Moray and Perth and Kinross . Their councils, and those of Angus and Stirling , also have areas of the Scottish Highlands within their administrative boundaries.     The Highland area covers most of the mainland and inner-Hebridean parts of the historic counties of Inverness-shire and Ross and Cromarty , all of Caithness , Nairnshire and Sutherland and small parts of Argyll and Moray .

To refer specifically to the area covered by the council, people tend to say the Highland Council area or the Highland area or the Highland region. Otherwise, they may also refer to the traditional county names, such as Ross.
