The concept for Nights originated during the development of  Sonic the Hedgehog 2  in 1992, but development did not begin until after the release of  Sonic & Knuckles  in late 1994.

According to Naka, the initial development team consisted of seven people, and grew to 20 as programmers arrived.      Sonic the Hedgehog creator and project director Ohshima created the character of Nights based on his inspirations from travelling around Europe and western Asia. He came to the conclusion that the character should resemble an angel and fly like a bird. Naka originally intended to make Nights into Dreams a slow-paced game, but as development progressed the gameplay pace gradually increased, in similar vein to Sonic games. The initial concept envisioned the flying character in a rendered 2D sprite art, with side-scrolling features similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. The team were hesitant to switch the game from 2D to 3D, as Naka was sceptical that appealing characters could be created with polygons, in contrast to traditional pixel sprites, which ": null

There were problems during early stages of development because of a lack of games to use as reference; the team had to redesign the Spring Valley level numerous times and build everything from scratch . The team used the Sega Graphics Library operating system, said by many developers to make programming for the Saturn dramatically easier, only sparingly, instead creating the game almost entirely with custom libraries.  Because the Sonic Team offices did not include soundproof studios, team members recorded sound effects at night. According to Naka, every phrase in the game has a meaning; for example, abayo is Japanese slang for goodbye .

Naka said that the movies incorporate realism to make it more difficult for the player to disambiguate the boundary between dreams and reality.     The development took longer than expected because of the teams inexperience with Saturn hardware and uncertainty about using the full 560 megabyte space on the CD-ROM. The team initially thought that the game would consume around 100 megabytes of data, and at one point considered releasing it on two separate discs.
