On February 24, 1803, the Court rendered a unanimous 4–0 decision against Marbury. The Courts decision was delayed by one year because, in retaliation for the Adams appointment of the Midnight Judges , Jefferson and the new Democratic-Republican Congressmen successfully passed a bill that canceled the Supreme Courts 1802 term, and so all pending casesincluding Marbury v. Madisonwere not decided until 1803.     The Courts opinion was written by the Chief Justice, John Marshall. Marshall structured the Courts opinion around a series of three questions that Marshall answered in turn:   First, did Marbury have a right to his commission?   Second, if Marbury had a right to his commission, was there a legal remedy for him to obtain it?   Third, if there was such a remedy, could the Supreme Court legally issue it?       The Court quickly answered the first two questions affirmatively. First, Marshall wrote that Marbury had a right to his commission because all appropriate procedures were followed: the commission had been properly signed and sealed. Madison contended that the commissions were void if not delivered, but the Court disagreed, and said that the delivery of the commission was merely a custom, not an essential element of the commission itself.          Because Marburys commission was valid, Marshall wrote, Madisons withholding of it was violative of a vested legal right on Marburys part.     Turning to the second question, the Court said that the laws clearly afforded Marbury a remedy. Marshall wrote that it is a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy by suit or action at law, whenever that right is invaded a rule derived from the traditional Roman legal maxim ubi jus, ibi remedium , which was well established in the early ": null

The Court held that so long as the remedy involved a mandatory duty to a specific person, and not a political matter left to discretion, the courts could provide the legal remedy.

This brought Marshall to the most important issue of the opinion: the propriety of the Supreme Courts jurisdiction over the matter, which would determine whether or not the Court had the power to issue the writ Marbury requested. This issue depended entirely on how the Court interpreted the text of a law Congress had passed that dealt with the Supreme Courts original and appellate jurisdictions. As Marshall explains in the opinion, under , a court has the power to be the first to hear and decide a case; under , a party to an instituted decision appeals to a higher court, which has the power to revise and correct the previous decision.

The Judiciary Act contained a section that defines areas in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, and areas in which it has appellate jurisdiction.          Marbury had argued that this section gave the Supreme Court the authority to issue writs of mandamus when hearing cases under original jurisdiction, not just appellate jurisdiction. Although the language on the power to issue writs of mandamus appears with the sentence on appellate jurisdiction, rather than with the earlier sentences on original jurisdiction, a semicolon separates it from the specific clause on appellate jurisdiction. The section itself does not make clear whether the mandamus clause was intended to be read as part of the appellate sentence or on its ownin the opinion, Marshall quoted only the end of the sectionand the laws wording can plausibly be read either way. In the end, Marshall agreed with Marbury, and interpreted section 13 of the Judiciary Act to authorize mandamus on original jurisdiction.     However, Marshall then noted that this authorization clashed with Article III of the Constitution, which establishes the judicial branch of the U.S. government. Section 2 of Article III defines the nature of the Supreme Courts original and appellate jurisdiction:          This section says that the Supreme Court only has original jurisdiction over cases where a U.S. State is a party to a lawsuit or where a lawsuit involves foreign dignitaries. Neither of these categories covered Marburys justice of the peace commission, and so, according to the Constitution, the Court could only have heard Marburys case while exercising appellate jurisdiction. However, Marshall had interpreted the Judiciary Act to have given the Court original jurisdiction over the matter: this meant that the Judicial Act apparently took the initial scope of the Supreme Courts original jurisdictionwhich was limited to cases either directly involving States or involving foreign dignitariesand expanded it to include issuing writs of mandamus. Marshall ruled that Congress cannot increase the Supreme Courts original jurisdiction as it was set down in the Constitution, and therefore that the relevant portion of Section 13 of the Judiciary Act violated Article III of the Constitution.             After ruling that it conflicted with the Constitution, Marshall struck down the relevant portion of the Judiciary Act in the U.S. Supreme Courts first ever declaration of the power of ": null

In his opinion, the dilemma was not difficult: The question whether an act repugnant to the Constitution can become the law of the land is a question deeply interesting to the United States, but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. Marbury, 5 U.S. at 176, quoted in . He held virtually as a matter of iron logic that in the event of conflict between the Constitution and statutory laws passed by Congress, the constitutional law must be supreme. Again borrowing from Federalist No. 78, Marshall stated:        Third, Marshall stated that denying the supremacy of the Constitution over Congresss acts would mean that courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law. , quoting Marbury, 5 U.S. at 178. He reasoned that this, in turn, would make Congress omnipotent, since none of the laws it passed would ever be invalid:        Marshall then gave several other reasons in favor of judicial review. He argued that the authorization in Article III of the Constitution that the Court can decide cases arising under this Constitution implied that the Court had the power to strike down laws conflicting with the Constitution. This, Marshall wrote, meant that the Founders were willing to have the American judiciary use and interpret the Constitution when judging cases. He also argued that federal judges oaths of office—in which they swear to discharge their duties impartially and agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States —requires them to support the Constitution.

    {
        " of the Constitution, since it declares the supreme law of the United States to be not the Constitution and the laws of the United States in general, but rather the Constitution and laws made in Pursuance thereof .     Marshall concluded the Courts opinion:                 Besides its inherent legal questions, the case of Marbury v. Madison also created a difficult political dilemma for Marshall and the rest of the Supreme Court. If the Court ruled in favor of Marbury and issued a writ of mandamus ordering Madison to deliver the commission, Jefferson and Madison would probably have simply ignored the order, which would have made the Court look impotent and emphasized the shakiness of the judiciary. On the other hand, a plain and simple ruling against Marbury would have given Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans a clear political victory.     Marshall avoided both problems and solved the dilemma. First, he ruled that Madisons withholding of Marburys commission was illegal, which pleased the Federalists. But then he said the Court could not give Marbury his requested writ of mandamus, which gave Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans the result they desired. At the same time, he maneuvered Marburys simple petition for a writ of mandamus into a case that presented a question that went to heart of American constitutional law itself in what the American constitutional law scholar ": null

He seized the occasion to uphold the institution of judicial review, but he did so in the course of reaching a judgment that his political opponents could neither defy nor protest.

        " emphasized that one can criticize Marshalls opinion in Marbury without demeaning it: The courage of Marbury v. Madison is not minimized by suggesting that its reasoning is not impeccable and its conclusion, however wise, not inevitable.  Criticisms of Marshalls opinion in Marbury usually fall into two general categories.     First, some criticize the way Marshall strove to reach the conclusion that the U.S. Supreme Court has constitutional authority over the other branches of the U.S. government. Today, American courts generally follow the principle of constitutional avoidance : if a certain interpretation of a law raises constitutional problems, they prefer to use alternative interpretations that avoid these problems, so long as the alternative interpretations are still plausible. In Marbury, Marshall could have avoided the constitutional questions through different legal rulings: for example, if he had ruled that Marbury did not have a right to his commission until it was delivered, or if he had ruled that refusals to honor political appointments could only be remedied through the political process and not the judicial process, it would have ended the case immediately, and the Court would not have reached the cases constitutional issues. Marshall did not do so, and many legal scholars have criticized him for it. However, others have noted that the constitutional avoidance principle did not exist in 1803, and in any case is only a general guide for Court action , not an ironclad precept. Alternatively, it has also been argued that the claim that Marshall strove to create a controversy largely vanishes when the case is viewed from the legal perspective of the late 18th century, when American colonies and states supreme courts were largely modeled on the British ": null

    {
        "Court of Kings Bench": "court of kings bench"
    },
    {
        ", which inherently possessed mandamus powers.     Second, Marshalls arguments for the Courts authority are sometimes said to be mere series of assertions , rather than substantive reasons logically laid out to support his position. It is generally agreed that Marshalls series of assertions regarding the U.S. Constitution and the actions of the other branches of government do not inexorably lead to the conclusion that Marshall draws from them.  Marshalls assertion of the American judiciarys authority to review executive branch actions was the most controversial issue when Marbury was first decided, and several subsequent U.S. presidents have tried to dispute it, to varying degrees.     Additionally, it is questionable whether Marshall should have participated in the Marbury case because of his participating role in the dispute. Marshall was still the acting Secretary of State when the nominations were made, and he himself had signed Marbury and the other mens commissions and had been responsible for their delivery. This potential conflict of interest raises strong grounds for Marshall to have recused himself from the case. In hindsight, the fact that Marshall did not recuse himself from Marbury is likely indicative of his eagerness to hear the case and use it to establish judicial review.          Marbury v. Madison remains the single most important decision in American constitutional law. It established American judges authority to review the constitutionality of Congresss legislative acts, and to this day the Supreme Courts power to review the constitutionality of American laws at both the federal and state level is generally rested upon the epic decision of Marbury v. Madison.      Although the Courts opinion in Marbury established judicial review in American federal law, it did not create or invent it.
