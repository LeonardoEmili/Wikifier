The Sergeant begins to realize that this is not a normal road, and these are not just wounded soldiers. He tells Lavinia that there is something at the end of the road, and that he has to find out what it is. As the Sergeant turns to leave, Lavinia moves in front of him and tries to persuade him to stay. Suddenly they hear a mans voice singing a familiar song. The man is Lavinias husband, Jud.     Jud tells Lavinia that everyone on the road is indeed deadâ€”including her. The Sergeant, understanding now, walks down the road, but Lavinia refuses to believe that it is true. Jud tells her that there is nothing left for him in that house. Insisting that she is alive, Lavinia pleads with Jud to stay. Jud refuses and continues his journey, disregarding her pleas. As he leaves, Jud tells Lavinia that he will be waiting for her at the end of the road.     Lavinia cries out to her husband, imploring him to stay. Then she hears a soft voice trying to comfort her.
