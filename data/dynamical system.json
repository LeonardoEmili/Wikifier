        ".       The qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates : a singular point of the vector field  will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a periodic orbit is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop. It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.       A flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple. If y is a point where the vector field v  ≠  0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around y where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude. This is known as the rectification theorem.     The rectification theorem says that away from ": null

        " the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line. The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space M the dynamical system is integrable. In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space. There may be singular points in the vector field ; or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.       In general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used. Poincaré developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point x 0 in the orbit γ and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to v. These points are a ": null

The intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincaré section is a fixed point of the Poincaré map F. By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at x    0. The Taylor series of the map is F    J  ·  x  +  O, so a change of coordinates h can only be expected to simplify F to its linear part     : h^ \\circ F \\circ h J \\cdot x.     This is known as the conjugation equation. Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems. Poincaré first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition. If λ 1 ,  ...,  λ ν are the eigenvalues of J they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others. As terms of the form λ i & ndash; ∑ occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function h, the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.       The results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of J and the degree of smoothness required from h. As J does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers. When the eigenvalues of J are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point x 0 of F is called  hyperbolic  and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called elliptic.
