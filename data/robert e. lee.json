The estate was in disarray, and the plantations had been poorly managed and were losing money.    Lee tried to hire an overseer to handle the plantation in his absence, writing to his cousin, I wish to get an energetic honest farmer, who while he will be considerate & kind to the negroes, will be firm & make them do their duty.  But Lee failed to find a man for the job, and had to take a two-year leave of absence from the army in order to run the plantation himself.

Lee privately wrote to his son Custis that The N. Y. Tribune has attacked me for my treatment of your grandfathers slaves, but I shall not reply. He has left me an unpleasant legacy.      Wesley Norris himself spoke out about the incident after the war, in an 1866 interview printed in an abolitionist newspaper, the  National Anti-Slavery Standard . Norris stated that after they had been captured, and forced to return to Arlington, Lee told them that he would teach us a lesson we would not soon forget. According to Norris, Lee then had the three of them firmly tied to posts by the overseer, and ordered them whipped with fifty lashes for the men and twenty for Mary Norris. Norris claimed that Lee encouraged the whipping, and that when the overseer refused to do it, called in the county constable to do it instead. Unlike the anonymous letter writers, he does not state that Lee himself whipped any of the slaves.

Custis, December 29, 1862       Biographers of Lee have differed over the credibility of the account of the punishment as described in the letters in the Tribune and in Norriss personal account. They broadly agree that Lee had a group of escaped slaves recaptured, and that after recapturing them he hired them out off of the Arlington plantation as a punishment; but they disagree over the likelihood that Lee flogged them, and over the charge that he personally whipped Mary Norris.

The usage at Arlington and elsewhere in Virginia among people of Lees station forbade such a thing.      In 2000, Michael Fellman, in  The Making of Robert E. Lee , found the claims that Lee had personally whipped Mary Norris extremely unlikely, but found it not at all unlikely that Lee had ordered the runaways whipped: corporal punishment was an intrinsic and necessary part of slave discipline. Although it was supposed to be applied only in a calm and rational manner, overtly physical domination of slaves, unchecked by law, was always brutal and potentially savage.      In 2003, Bernice-Marie Yatess The Perfect Gentleman, cited Freemans denial and followed his account in holding that, because of Lees family connections to George Washington, he was a prime target for abolitionists who lacked all the facts of the situation.      Lee biographer Elizabeth Brown Pryor concluded in 2008 that the facts are verifiable, based on the consistency of the five extant descriptions of the episode , as well as the existence of an account book that indicates the constable received compensation from Lee on the date that this event occurred. Elizabeth Brown Pryor, Reading the Man: A Portrait of Robert E. Lee Through His Private Letters , chapter 16. Ariel Burriss, .     In 2014, Michael Korda wrote that Although these letters are dismissed by most of Lees biographers as exaggerated, or simply as unfounded abolitionist propaganda, it is hard to ignore them. ... It seems incongruously out of character for Lee to have whipped a slave woman himself, particularly one stripped to the waist, and that charge may have been a flourish added by the two correspondents; it was not repeated by Wesley Norris when his account of the incident was published in 1866. ... though it seems unlikely that he would have done any of the whipping himself, he may not have flinched from observing it to make sure his orders were carried out exactly.        Several historians have noted the paradoxical nature of Lees beliefs and actions concerning race and slavery. While Lee protested he had sympathetic feelings for blacks, they were subordinate to his own racial identity.  While Lee held slavery to be an evil institution, he also saw some benefit to blacks held in slavery. Cox, R. David. The Religious Life of Robert E. Lee 2017, , p. 157 While Lee helped assist individual slaves to freedom in Liberia, and provided for their emancipation in his own will,  he believed the enslaved should be eventually freed in a general way only at some unspecified future date as a part of Gods purpose.

McCaslin, Lee was a gradual emancipationist, denouncing extremist proposals for immediate abolition of slavery. Lee rejected what he called evilly motivated political passion, fearing a civil and servile war from precipitous emancipation.      Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor offered an alternative interpretation of Lees voluntary manumission of slaves in his will, and assisting slaves to a life of freedom in Liberia, seeing Lee as conforming to a primacy of slave law . She wrote that Lees private views on race and slavery,   : which today seem startling, were entirely unremarkable in Lees world. No visionary, Lee nearly always tried to conform to accepted opinions. His assessment of black inferiority, of the necessity of racial stratification, the primacy of slave law, and even a divine sanction for it all, was in keeping with the prevailing views of other moderate slaveholders and a good many prominent Northerners. Pryor, Elizabeth Brown.  , p. 151.     On taking on the role of administrator for the Parke Custis will, Lee used a provision to retain them in slavery to produce income for the estate to retire debt. Lee did not welcome the role of planter while administering the Custis properties at Romancoke, another nearby the Pamunkey River and Arlington; he rented the estates mill. While all the estates prospered under his administration, Lee was unhappy at direct participation in slavery as a hated institution.     Even before what Michael Fellman called a sorry involvement in actual slave management , Lee judged the experience of white mastery to be a greater moral evil to the white man than blacks suffering under the painful discipline of slavery which introduced Christianity, literacy and a work ethic to the heathen African .

But I think equally important is that, unlike some white southerners, he never spoke out against slavery    By the time of Lees career in the U.S. Army, the officers of West Point stood aloof from political-party and sectional strife on such issues as slavery, as a matter of principle, and Lee adhered to the principle. Skelton, William B., , 1992, p. 285. Officers developed a conception of the army as an apolitical instrument of public policy. As servants of the nation, they should stand aloof from party and sectional strife and avoid taking public positions on controversial issues such as slavery. Davis, William.  , p. 46. From early manhood Lee held a low opinion of politicians, and believed military men should stay out of politics. He considered it his patriotic duty to be apolitical while in active Army service, . In 1863, even before Chancellorsville, Lee began to advance, for the first time, a political understanding of the war, quite unlike his previous apolitical belief in duty . Taylor, John. , 1999, p. 223. He epitomized the nonpolitical tradition in the U.S. military, and his lifelong attempt to remain aloof from the political turmoil about him would be emulated by twentieth-century soldiers ... Pryor, Elizabeth Brown. , 2008, p.284. Pryor notes in describing Lees public silence on controversial sectional issues such as slavery, that the regular army was an apolitical institution, which discouraged displays of partisan sentiment and muted any parochialism in its officers. At the military academy a cadet was taught that he belongs no longer to section or party but, in his life and all his faculties, to his country. and Lee did not speak out publicly on the subject of slavery prior to the Civil War. Foner, Eric quoted in Fortin, Jacey. , NYT Aug 18, unlike some white southerners, never spoke out against slavery. . Lee believed in Gods time, not mans, and Gods disposition, not human politics.

There are various historical and newspaper hearsay accounts of Lee personally whipping a slave, but they are not direct eyewitness accounts. He was definitely involved in administering the day-to-day operations of a plantation and was involved in the recapture of runaway slaves.  One historian noted that Lee separated slave families, something that prominent slave-holding families in Virginia such as Washington and Custis did not do.  In 1862, Lee freed the slaves that his wife inherited, but that was in accordance with his father-in-laws will.      Lee claimed that he found slavery bothersome and time-consuming as an everyday institution to run. In an 1856 letter to his wife, he maintained that slavery was a great evil, but primarily due to adverse impact that it had on white people:  In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.

He replied:    Lee immediately went to Scott, who tried to persuade him that Union forces would be large enough to prevent the South from fighting, so he would not have to oppose his state; Lee disagreed. When Lee asked if he could go home and not fight, the fellow Virginian said that the army did not need equivocal soldiers and that if he wanted to resign, he should do so before receiving official orders. Scott told him that he had made the greatest mistake of your life .     Lee agreed that to avoid dishonor he had to resign before receiving unwanted orders. While historians have usually called his decision inevitable  given the ties to family and state, an 1871 letter from his eldest daughter, Mary Custis Lee, to a biographer described Lee as worn and harassed yet calm as he deliberated alone in his office. People on the street noticed Lees grim face as he tried to decide over the next two days, and he later said that he kept the resignation letter for a day before sending it on April 20. Two days later the Richmond convention invited Lee to the city. It elected him as commander of Virginia state forces before his arrival on April 23, and almost immediately gave him George Washingtons sword as symbol of his appointment; whether he was told of a decision he did not want without time to decide, or did want the excitement and opportunity of command, is unclear.       A cousin on Scotts staff told the family that Lees decision so upset Scott that he collapsed on a sofa and mourned as if he had lost a son, and asked to not hear Lees name.

Previously, most students had been obliged to occupy the campus dormitories, while only the most mature were allowed to live off-campus. Lee quickly reversed this rule, requiring most students to board off-campus, and allowing only the most mature to live in the dorms as a mark of privilege; the results of this policy were considered a success. A typical account by a professor there states that the students fairly worshipped him, and deeply dreaded his displeasure; yet so kind, affable, and gentle was he toward them that all loved to approach him. ... No student would have dared to violate General Lees expressed wish or appeal; if he had done so, the students themselves would have driven him from the college.

They have grown up in our midst, and we have been accustomed from childhood to look upon them with kindness.  However, it also called for the restoration of white political rule, arguing that It is true that the people of the South, in common with a large majority of the people of the North and West, are, for obvious reasons, inflexibly opposed to any system of laws that would place the political power of the country in the hands of the negro race. But this opposition springs from no feeling of enmity, but from a deep-seated conviction that, at present, the negroes have neither the intelligence nor the other qualifications which are necessary to make them safe depositories of political power.      In his public statements and private correspondence, Lee argued that a tone of reconciliation and patience would further the interests of white Southerners better than hotheaded antagonism to federal authority or the use of violence.
