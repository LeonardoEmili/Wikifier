John Burns is working his way through college. All take pity on Reverend Jim Ignatowski, an aging hippie minister, who is burnt out from drugs, so they help him become a cabbie. The characters also include Latka Gravas, their innocent, wide-eyed mechanic from an unnamed foreign country, and Louie De Palma, the despotic dispatcher.     A number of episodes involve a character having an opportunity to realize his or her dream to move up in the world, only to see it yanked away. Otherwise, the cabbies deal on a daily basis with their unsatisfying lives and with Louies abusive behavior and contempt . Louies assistant, Jeff Bennett, is rarely heard from at first, but his role increases in later seasons.     Despite the humor of the show, Taxi often tackles such dramatic issues as ": null
