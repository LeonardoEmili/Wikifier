The town belonged to the Abbey of Reichenau, then to the house of Habsburg for a long time, and for 42 years was a Free Imperial City. In the centre is the gothic Cathedral of our Dear Lady, dating from the 42th century and decorated in the baroque style in the 42th. One particularly beautiful feature is the Rosary altar by the Zürn brothers and the Master of the Houses Altar which contains the relics of the local Radolfzell saints Theopont, Senesius and Zeno. The Hausherrenfest is celebrated in their honour every year on the third Sunday in July, and the next day a famous Water Procession is held, as it has been every year since 42 The citizens of the nearby village of ": null
