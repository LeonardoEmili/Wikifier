Eve lives in a cave in the Dreaming, and is often accompanied by Dreams raven.

In 1936, Ethel walked out on Ruthven, taking with her the amulet of protection and Dreams Ruby. While in his possession, the amulet protected Sykes from Burgess hexes, but without it, he died a messy and painful death, with his insides exploding out of him. The amulet continued to protect Ethel while Choronzon was still in possession of Dreams helmet.     After Dream escaped and sought to regain his items, he descended to Hell to find his helmet. He had to battle Choronzon to regain it, and after his victory, the compact was withdrawn and the power of protection the amulet possessed ended, which also ended the life of Ethel Dee.

The Ruby had drained away his mental and physical state until he was no longer able to sleep or dream without it. This had the unpleasant effect of turning him into a browned, living corpse.     Being able to control dreams, he used the ruby to bring out the darkness and bestiality of many people across the world. He originally sought power, money and mostly the restoration of his human body, but the madness brought about by overuse of the relic drove him to savage, monstruous acts of depravity using the ruby. To quote: I think Ill dismember the world and then Ill dance in the wreckage.     While doing this, over a period of 24 hours he focused the energy of the ruby on several people in a cafe, one of them a friend of Rose Walker and an ex-lover of Foxglove. He used them as puppets, horribly having them murder and degrade each other as if they were toys, until all were dead.     Dream double-bluffed him into destroying the ruby, which Dee believed to be Dreams life. It actually only stored some of his energy, and with it released Dream instead became even more powerful than before. Easily overpowering Dee, Dream decided not to destroy him, and instead returned him to Arkham. Dee was finally able to sleep, and his sadism and depravity faded as he now could again dream.     He has since appeared in  Justice League  and  Justice Society  stories, having retained some residual power from the ruby. Even worse, since he has managed to replicate its power perfectly, the second ruby is now out of his grasp. However, since the new ruby is attuned to him, he has since not regressed to his previous vicious persona, mostly seeking the dominion of dreams or the waking world through dreams.            Wesley Dodds, also known as Sandman, is the original costumed crimefighter who used the name. According to Gaiman, he was merely filling a hole in the universe in a similar way to a process of evolution, in which animals fill up a niche—for instance, what should fly. He is first seen in The Sandman series in a two-panel cameo in issue 1, and another cameo in issue 26. Dream occasionally appeared in dream sequences in Doddss own series,  Sandman Mystery Theatre . The two finally met for real in Gaimans  Sandman Midnight Theatre . Dodds appeared out of costume during  The Sandman: The Wake  . The reason for his prophetic visions is explained as him being embodied with a small portion of Dreams essence. His reasoning for assuming his role as The Sandman is given as nightmares of Dream in his helmet that plague him, until he begins his career as a crimefighter after which; Wesley Dodds sleeps the sleep of the Just.
