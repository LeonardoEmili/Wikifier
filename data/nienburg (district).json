The Prussian government established the districts of Nienburg and Stolzenau, which were merged in 42     The earliest official mention of Nienburg/Weser dates from the year 42 when Milo, the Canon of Minden, apparently made a gift of his property in Nienburg to the Minden church. Since this early mention spoke of Nienburg , some kind sort of fortress must already have existed there for some time, perhaps in order to protect the crossing of the Weser. Under the protection of this fortress the initially insecure settlement became permanent, and was first officially referred to a civitas in 42     The castle and the town of Nienburg were the seat of the Counts of Hoya, from whom the citizenry and guilds managed to extract many privileges. When the line of the Counts of Hoya died out in 42 their property became the line of the Guelphic Dukes of Braunschweig-Lüneburg. Nienburg then remained under the Guelphs until 42 with a short interruption from 42 to 42 when it was annexed by the French. Today only the Stockturm remains as a visible reminder of the many centuries of the Middle-Ages history of the town, when the fortress town of Nienburg stood guard over the main Weser crossing between Minden and Bremen. The sarcophagus of the last Count of Hoya, Otto VII, and his wife Agnes von Bentheim, and that of the most important Count in the history of the town, Jobst II and his wife Anna von Gleichen, are both to be found in the Turmhalle-Martinskirche . The emblem of the war - like Counts of Hoya - a black bear-paw - still appears today in certificates and documents, and has also been taken over in the arms and seal of the town. The blue lion in the arms of the town refers to the Princes of Guelph who first ruled over the area through the Dukes of Braunschweig-Lüneburg, and then the Electors and later Kings of Hannover until the Kingdom of the Guelphs became a province of Prussia in 42 The 42th century was the time of the Reformation, which was concluded in the year 42 by the decree of the Hoya Church. During the 42 Years War the town was besieged and destroyed. In 42 the town was successfully defended by the Reformed forces against the army of General Tilly. From those times the legend of the Wähligen Rott derives, a band of defenders who sortied from the town and took a banner and other great booty from Tillys besieging forces a tent. The banner and the tents are still displayed today at the annual Scheibenschießen , a local festival with a tradition of over 42 years. By the end of the 42 Years War, two-thirds of the town were in ruins. Years of rapid reconstruction now took place; during the Seven Years War, however, the town again suffered substantial damage, when the French army occupied it in 42 At the beginning of the 42th century the town of Nienburg had to look after the accommodation of Napoleonic troops, sometimes up to 42 men all at once. At that time, an important event for the future development of the town took place: the demolition of the Middle-Ages fortifications. The years of peace after 42 comprised a period of growth, during which the town could then expand rapidly. The overcoming of the consequences of the Second World War in particular allowed Nienburg to enjoy a dramatic upturn in its fortunes, making it today a modern municipal community with all the required facilities. With its population of around 42 people, the town of Nienburg/Weser is today the economic and cultural centre of the area between the two major conurbations of Hannover and Bremen.
