When they reach the vicinity of the Ringworld, they are unable to contact anyone, and their ship, the Lying Bastard, is disabled by the Ringworlds automated meteoroid-defense system. The severely damaged vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands near a huge mountain, Fist-of-God . Although many of the ships systems survive intact the normal drive is destroyed leaving them unable to launch back into space where they could use the undamaged faster-than-light hyperdrive to return home. They set out to find a way to get the Lying Bastard off of the Ringworld.     Using their flycycles , they try to reach the rim of the ring, where they hope to find some technology that will help them. It will take them months to cross the vast distance. When Teela develops Plateau trance , they are forced to land. On the ground, they encounter apparently primitive human natives who live in the crumbling ruins of a once-advanced city and think that the crew are the engineers who created the ring, and whom they revere as gods. The crew is attacked when they commit what the natives consider blasphemy .     They continue their journey, during which Nessus reveals some Puppeteer secrets: they have conducted experiments on both humans and Kzinti . Speakers outrage forces Nessus to flee and follow them from a safe distance.     In a floating building over the ruins of a city, they find a map of the Ringworld and videos of its past civilization.     While flying through a giant storm, caused by air escaping through a hole in the Ring floor due to a meteoroid impact, Teela becomes separated from the others. While Louis and Speaker search for her, their flycycles are caught by an automatic police trap designed to catch traffic offenders. They are trapped in the basement of a floating police station. Nessus enters the station to try to help them.     In the station, they meet Halrloprillalar Hotrufan , a former crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the Ringworld and other inhabited worlds. When her ship returned to the Ringworld the last time, they found that civilization had collapsed. The crew managed to enter the Ringworld, but some of them were killed and others suffered brain damage when the device that let them pass through the Ringworld floor failed. From her account, Louis surmises that a mold was brought back from one of the other planets by a spaceship like Prills; it broke down the superconductors vital to the Ringworld civilization, dooming it.     Teela reaches the police station, accompanied by her new lover, a native hero called Seeker who helped her survive. Based on an insight gained from studying an ancient Ringworld map, Louis comes up with a plan to get home. Teela, however, chooses to remain on the Ringworld with Seeker. Louis, formerly skeptical about breeding for luck, now wonders if the entire mission was caused by Teelas luck, to unite her with her true love and help her mature.     The party collects one end of the shadow-square wire that was snapped when the ship crashed. They travel back to their crashed ship in the floating police station, dragging the wire behind them. Louis threads it through the ship to tether it to the police station. He then takes the police station up to the summit of Fist-of-God , the enormous mountain near their crash site. The mountain had not appeared on the Ringworld map, leading Louis to conclude that it is in fact the result of a meteoroid impact with the underside of the ring, which pushed the mountain up from the rings floor and broke through. The top of the mountain, above the atmosphere, is therefore just a hole in the Ringworld floor. Louis drives the police station over the edge, dragging the Lying Bastard along with it. The Ringworld spins very quickly, so once the ship drops through the hole and clears the ring, they can use the ships hyperdrive to get home. The book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.       ": null

The opening chapter of the original paperback edition of Ringworld featured Louis Wu teleporting eastward around the Earth in order to extend his birthday. Moving in this direction would, in fact, make local time later rather than earlier, so that Wu would soon arrive in the early morning of the next calendar day. Niven was endlessly teased about this error, which he corrected in subsequent printings to show Wu teleporting westward.  In his dedication to The Ringworld Engineers, Niven wrote, If you own a first paperback edition of Ringworld, its the one with the mistakes in it. Its worth money.      After the publication of Ringworld, many fans identified numerous engineering problems in the Ringworld as described in the novel.
