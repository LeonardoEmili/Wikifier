Heightfields can be planar or distorted using UV displacement mapping onto spheres, sphere sections, cones, cylinders, etc. Vector shapes are supported using a separate vector layer, and can be used to   situate edits and generate heightfield selection masks and formations. For civil engineers, cut/fill and cross-section analysis is available too.     Since version 42, Leveller includes vector shapes, which can be used for both modeling and coloration. With version 42, true 42D scene objects and shader-based ground textures can be placed. In version 42, Unicode is supported along with limited support for non-North American locales.
