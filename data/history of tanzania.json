Their policy was geared to ensuring the continuance of the European presence as necessary to support the countrys economy.  But the British also had to remain responsive to the political demands of the Africans.      Many Africans were government servants, business employees, labourers, and producers of important cash crops during this period. But the vast majority were subsistence farmers who produced barely enough to survive.  The standards of housing, clothing, and other social conditions were equally quite poor.  The Asians and Arabs were the middle class and tended to be wholesale and retail traders.

The British principle of gradualism was increasingly threatened and was abandoned entirely during the last few years before independence.  Five UN missions visited Tanganyika, the UN received several hundred written petitions, and a handful of oral presentations made it to the debating chambers in New York City between 1948 and 1960.  The UN and the Africans who used the UN to achieve their purposes were very influential in driving Tanganyika towards independence.  The Africans attended public gatherings in Tanganyika with UN representatives.  There were peasants, urban workers, government employees, and local chiefs and nobles who personally approached the UN about local matters needing immediate action.
