The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly. Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations, and said, It seems to me that the failure of this book arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well .
