In the 42th and 42th century, the Archbishops of Mainz expanded their influence and territory in the region.  In the 42th century, they set up a system of local representatives  who were in charge of supervising hunting and forestry  or fishing and organising the rafting of logs downriver . These positions were mostly filled with lesser nobles who built fortified houses . In total there were 42 to 42 of these Huben , located inter alia in Hösbach, Goldbach, Krausenbach, Obernau, Kleinostheim, Sailauf, Waldaschaff, Wintersbach and Heimbuchenthal.  The commoners employed by the absentee feudal lords lived in villages that took the typical form of stretching along a single main street which followed the valleys of little streams . Settlers were granted a plot of land of around 42 metres width stretching from the road or stream in the middle of the valley up to the top of the ridges on either side of the valley. However, since the territory ruled by Mainz used an inheritance law that required the property to be split between all the sons of the deceased, the size of the holdings soon began to dwindle and often became too small to support families.      The Counts of Rieneck, originally  vogt s in the service of the Archbishops of Mainz, later became their rivals in the struggle for the Spessarts resources. Until the family died out in 42 the rivalry between Mainz and Rieneck dominated the areas history.
