The war ranks among the most catastrophic in history as three decades of constant warfare and destruction have left the land devastated. Marauding armies incessantly pillaged the countryside, seized and levied heavy taxes on cities and indiscriminately plundered the food stocks of the peasantry. There were also the countless bands of murderous outlaws, sick, homeless, disrupted people and invalid soldiery. Overall social and economic disruption caused a dramatic decline in population as a result of pandemic murder and random rape and killings, endemic infectious diseases, crop failures, famine, declining birth rates, wanton burglary, witch-hunts and the emigration of terrified people.

Luthers translation of the Bible into German was a decisive impulse for the increase of literacy and stimulated printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 42 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe. The Reformation instigated a media revolution as by 42 over 42 individual works are published with a total of ten million copies. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a good against bad church. It soon became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clichés, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.  Especially effective were Luthers Small Catechism, for use of parents teaching their children, and Larger Catechism, for pastors.

Increasingly after 42 a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 42 and extended the loan network to peasants in 42 When the German Empire was established in 42 the Junker nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.        Peasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body, and to help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.  For details on the life of a representative peasant farmer, who migrated in 42 to Pennsylvania, see Bernd Kratz, Jans Stauffer: A Farmer in Germany before his Emigration to Pennsylvania, Genealogist, Fall 42 Vol. 42 Issue 42 pp 42–42          The emancipation of the serfs came in 42–42 beginning with Schleswig in 42 The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, buy and sell it, and move about freely.

The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 42 In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 42th century.

Marion W. Gray, Productive men, reproductive women: the agrarian household and the emergence of separate spheres during the German Enlightenment . They reorganized into separate living arrangements. No longer did the owners wife take charge of all the females in the different families in the whole house. In the new system, farm owners became more professionalized and profit-oriented. They managed the fields and the household exterior according to the dictates of technology, science, and economics. Farm wives supervised family care and the household interior, to which strict standards of cleanliness, order, and thrift applied. The result was the spread of formerly urban bourgeois values into rural Germany. Marion W. Gray and June K. Burton, Bourgeois Values in the Rural Household, 42–42: The New Domesticity in Germany, The Consortium on Revolutionary Europe, 42–42 42 : 42–42     The lesser families were now living separately on wages. They had to provide for their own supervision, health, schooling, and old-age. At the same time, because of the demographic transition, there were far fewer children, allowing for much greater attention to each child. Increasingly the middle-class family valued its privacy and its inward direction, shedding too-close links with the world of work. Nipperdey, ch 42 Furthermore, the working classes, the middle classes and the upper classes became physically, psychologically and politically more separate. This allowed for the emergence of working-class organizations. It also allowed for declining religiosity among the working-class, who were no longer monitored on a daily basis.

The ideas of the Enlightenment and their implementation received general approval and recognition as principal cause for widespread cultural progress.        Before the 42th century, young women lived under the economic and disciplinary authority of their fathers until they married and passed under the control of their husbands. In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages.

In 42 Germanys social structure was poorly suited to entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the French Revolution , however, produced important institutional reforms, that included the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. The idea, that these reforms were beneficial for Industrialization has been contested.  Nevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in the many small principalities. Until 42 the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches and the government bureaucracies maintained many rules and restrictions that held entrepreneurship in low esteem and given little opportunity to develop. From the 42s and 42s, Prussia, Saxony and other states introduced agriculture based on sugar beets, turnips and potatoes, that yielded higher crops, which enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas.     In the early 42th century the Industrial Revolution was in full swing in Britain, France, and Belgium. The various small federal states in Germany developed only slowly and independently as competition was strong. Early investments for the railway network during the 42s came almost exclusively from private hands. Without a central regulatory agency the construction projects were quickly realized. Actual industrialization only took off after 42 in the wake of the railroad construction. The textile industry grew rapidly, profiting from the elimination of tariff barriers by the Zollverein.  During the second half of the 42th century the German industry grew exponentially and by 42 Germany was an industrial world leader along with Britain and the United States.     Historian ": null

        " remarks:   On the whole, industrialisation in Germany must be considered to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, in terms of social inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 42 and 42 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 42% to 42% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, alienation, new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare. Thomas Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 42–42 p 42       In 42 the population was predominantly rural, as only 42% lived in communities of 42 or more people, and only 42% lived in cities of more than 42 people. After 42 the urban population grew rapidly, due to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 42 in 42 to 42 inhabitants in 42 Hamburg from 42 to 42, Munich from 42 to 42 and Dresden from 42 to 42. Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 42–42 pp. 42–42             The takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 42s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron. Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 42s. However, by the 42s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist ": null

        " summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 42:     42 As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.   42 It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.   42 It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.   42 It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes. Nipperdey, Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 42–42 p.  42     Lacking a technological base at first, engineering and hardware was imported from Britain. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 42 Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 42 their engineering was inferior to Britain. However, German unification in 42 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was the support of industrialisation. Eventually numerous lines criss-crossed the Ruhr area and other industrial centers and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 42 42 locomotives pulled 42 passengers and 42 tons of freight a day.           While there existed no national newspaper the many states issued a great variety of printed media, although they rarely exceeded regional significance. In a typical town existed one or two outlets, urban centers, such as Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to a few percent of male adults, chiefly from the aristocratic and upper middle class. Liberal publishers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image. Theodore S. Hamerow, The Social Foundations of German Unification, 42–42: Ideas and Institutions pp 42–42 Censorship was strict, and the imperial government issued the political news that was supposed to be published. After 42 strict press laws were enforced by Bismarck to contain the Socialists and hostile editors. Editors focused on political commentary, culture, the arts, high culture and the popular serialized novels. Magazines were politically more influential and attracted intellectual authors. Kenneth E.

As the growth rates for the individual branches and sectors often varied considerably, and periodical figures provided by the Kaiserliches Statistisches Amt are often disputed or just assessments. Classification and naming of internationally traded commodities and exported goods was still in progress and the structure of production and export had changed during four decades.

Reasonably exact are the figures for the entire industrial production between 42 and 42 which increased about 42%.      Historian J. A. Perkins argued that more important than Bismarcks new tariff on imported grain was the introduction of the sugar beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including the use of artificial fertilizers and mechanical tools. Intensive methodical farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 42 Even so, farms were usually small in size and women did much of the field work.

By 42 American and German exports dominated the world steel market, as Britain slipped to third place.      In machinery, iron and steel, and other industries, German firms avoided cut-throat competition and instead relied on trade associations. Germany was a world leader because of its prevailing corporatist mentality , its strong bureaucratic tradition, and the encouragement of the government. These associations regulate competition and allowed small firms to function in the shadow of much larger companies.

Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 42 Italy.     In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, author Paul M. Kennedy recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germanys reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was Londons fear that a repeat of 42  – when Prussia and the German states smashed France  – would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France.
