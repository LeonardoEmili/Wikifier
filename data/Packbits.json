        "-files also use this RLE compression scheme, but treats data stream as pixels instead of bytes.     A PackBits data stream consists of packets with a one-byte header followed by data. The header is a signed byte; the data can be signed, unsigned, or packed .     In the following table, n is the value of the header byte as a signed integer.        Note that interpreting 0 as positive or negative makes no difference in the output. Runs of two bytes adjacent to non-runs are typically written as literal data. There is no way based on the PackBits data to determine the end of the data stream; that is to say, one must already know the size of the compressed or uncompressed data before reading a PackBits data stream to know where it ends.     Apple Computer provides this short example of packed data:   FE AA 02 80 00 2A FD AA 03 80 00 2A 22 F7 AA     The following code, written in Microsoft VBA, unpacks the data:     Sub UnpackBitsDemo   Dim File As Variant   Dim MyOutput As String   Dim Count As Long   Dim i As Long, j As Long     File FE AA 02 80 00 2A FD AA 03 80 00 2A 22 F7 AA   File Split     For i LBound To UBound   Count Application.WorksheetFunction.Hex2Dec   Select Case Count   Case Is /source source lang js   function i  ": null
