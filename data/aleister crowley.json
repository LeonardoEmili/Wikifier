He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship. He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus, and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon. Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe. Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of ones True Will to be the Great Work or the attaining of the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel . His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 42th-century grimoire.

He also told his disciple Karl Germer that Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level.  Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving The Equinox the subtitle of The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion.

In their subversive powers, he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions, and the creation of a void that Thelema, subsequently, would be able to fill.  Crowley described democracy as an imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness , and commented that The Book of the Law proclaimed that there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the lone wolf and the herd .

Crowley argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation, commenting that a person must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise.  On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.

He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a spiritual superiority to the English, and praised Muslims for exhibiting manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect .     Crowley also exhibited a general misogyny that Booth believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother. Sutin noted that Crowley largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility . Crowley described women as moral inferiors who had to be treated with firmness, kindness and justice .
