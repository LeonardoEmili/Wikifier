The white king can move into check on the first move of the turn and move out of check during the second move. The goal for both sides is to checkmate the opponents king.     Monster chess can also played with White starting with all eight pawns, or with only two. Monster chess can also played with colors reversed.     Queening a white pawn generally allows White to declare a checkmate within the next few moves. Also, with only the two kings on the board, White can easily force a Monster chess checkmate.       White must execute two moves in their turn. They can do this by moving a piece twice or two pieces once.   The white king may move into check and then out of check, provided that White can execute two moves.   If a king is in check, it must be placed out of check.   Otherwise, standard chess rules apply.   A king is in check if it could be captured on the next turn.   The White King can capture the Black King by virtue of the above rules.       ": null
