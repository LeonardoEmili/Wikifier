The knight is best suited at an outpost in the center, particularly where it cannot easily be driven away, whereas the bishop is strongest when it can attack targets on both sides of the board or a series of squares of the same color .     Fine and Benko  give four conclusions:   In general the bishop is better than the knight.   When there is a material advantage, the difference between the bishop and knight is not very important. However, the bishop usually wins more easily than the knight.   If the material is even, the position should be drawn. However, the bishop can exploit positional advantages more efficiently.   When most of the pawns are on the same color as the bishop , the knight is better.          This is a draw if the defending king is in front of the pawn or sufficiently close. The defending king can occupy a square in front of the pawn of the opposite color as the bishop and cannot be driven away. Otherwise the attacker can win .             This is a draw if the defending king is in front of the pawn or sufficiently near. The bishop is kept on a diagonal that the pawn must cross and the knight cannot both block the bishop and drive the defending king away. Otherwise the attacker can win .          Rook and pawn endgames are often drawn in spite of one side having an extra pawn. An extra pawn is harder to convert to a win in a rook and pawn endgame than any other type of endgame except a bishop endgame with bishops on opposite colors. Rook endings are probably the deepest and most well studied endgames. They are a common type of endgame in practice, occurring in about 42 percent of all games . These endgames occur frequently because rooks are often the last pieces to be exchanged. The ability to play these endgames well is a major factor distinguishing masters from amateurs . When both sides have two rooks and pawns, the stronger side usually has more winning chances than if each had only one rook .     Three rules of thumb regarding rooks are worth noting:   Rooks should almost always be placed behind passed pawns, whether ones own or the opponents . A notable exception is in the ending of a rook and pawn versus a rook, if the pawn is not too far advanced. In that case, the best place for the opposing rook is in front of the pawn.   Rooks are very poor defenders relative to their attacking strength, so it is often good to sacrifice a pawn for activity.   A rook on the seventh rank can wreak mayhem among the opponents pawns. The power of a rook on the seventh rank is not confined to the endgame. The classic example is ": null
