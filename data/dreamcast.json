On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out by the end of the day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of  Virtua Fighter 3 , the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply.

According to Moore, We needed to create something that would really intrigue consumers, somewhat apologize for the past, but invoke all the things we loved about Sega, primarily from the Genesis days. On August 11, Sega of America confirmed  that Stolar had been fired, leaving Moore to direct the launch.   cf.      The Dreamcast launched in North America on September 9, 1999 at a price of $199—which Segas marketing dubbed 9/9/99 for $199 .  Eighteen launch games were available for the Dreamcast in the U.S.   Sega set a new sales record by selling more than 225,132 Dreamcast units in 24 hours, earning the company $98.4 million in what Moore called the biggest 24 hours in entertainment retail history . Within two weeks, U.S. Dreamcast sales exceeded 500,000. By Christmas, Sega held 31 percent of the North American video game marketshare.

        ".      Segas initial momentum proved fleeting as U.S. Dreamcast sales—which exceeded 1.5 million by the end of 1999  —began to decline as early as January 2000. Poor Japanese sales contributed to Segas ¥42.88 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 2000, which followed a similar loss of ¥42.881 billion the previous year and marked Segas third consecutive annual loss.   Although Segas overall sales for the term increased 27.4%, and Dreamcast sales in North America and Europe greatly exceeded the companys expectations, this increase in sales coincided with a decrease in profitability due to the investments required to launch the Dreamcast in Western markets and poor software sales in Japan. At the same time, increasingly poor market conditions reduced the profitability of Segas Japanese arcade business, prompting the company to close 246 locations.  Knowing that they have to fish where the fish are biting , Sega of America president Peter Moore and Sega of Japans developers focused on the U.S. market to prepare for the upcoming launch of the PS2. To that end, Sega of America launched its own Internet service provider, Sega.com, led by CEO Brad Huang.  On September 7, 2000, Sega.com launched ": null

Although Sega had previously released only one Dreamcast game in the U.S. that featured online multiplayer , the launch of SegaNet combined with  NFL 2K1  was intended to increase demand for the Dreamcast in the U.S. market.  The service would later support games including  Bomberman Online ,  Quake III Arena , and  Unreal Tournament . The September 7 launch coincided with a new advertising campaign to promote SegaNet, including via the ": null

    {
        " of the same day, which Sega sponsored for the second consecutive year.  Sega employed aggressive pricing strategies with relation to online gaming. In Japan, every Dreamcast sold included a free year of Internet access, which Okawa personally paid for.  Prior to the launch of SegaNet, Sega had already offered a $200 rebate to any Dreamcast owner who purchased two years of Internet access from Sega.com.   To increase SegaNets appeal in the U.S., Sega dropped the price of the Dreamcast to $149 and offered a rebate for the full $149 price of a Dreamcast with every 18-month SegaNet subscription.           Moore stated that the Dreamcast would need to sell 5 million units in the U.S. by the end of 2000 in order to remain a viable platform, but Sega ultimately fell short of this goal with some 3 million units sold.  Moreover, Segas attempts to spur increased Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses.  Instead of an expected profit, for the six months ending September 2000, Sega posted a ¥17.98 billion loss, with the company projecting a year-end loss of ¥23.6 billion.  This estimate was more than doubled to ¥58.3 billion,  and in March 2001, Sega posted a consolidated net loss of ¥51.7 billion .  While the PS2s October 26 U.S. launch was marred by shortages—with only 500,000 of a planned 1 million units shipped due to a manufacturing glitch—this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected, as many disappointed consumers continued to wait for a PS2—while the PSone, a remodeled version of the original PlayStation, was the best-selling console in the U.S. at the start of the 2000 holiday season.   According to Moore, the PlayStation 2 effect that we were relying upon did not work for us  ... people will hang on for as long as possible  ... What effectively happened is the PlayStation 2 lack of availability froze the marketplace . Eventually, Sony and Nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of the U.S. video game market, respectively, while Sega held only 15 percent. According to Bellfield, Dreamcast software sold at an 8-to-1 ratio with the hardware, but this ratio on a small install base didnt give us the revenue  ... to keep this platform viable in the medium to long term.        On May 22, 2000, Okawa replaced Irimajiri as president of Sega. Okawa had long advocated that Sega abandon the console business. His sentiments were not unique; Sega co-founder David Rosen had always felt it was a bit of a folly for them to be limiting their potential to Sega hardware , and Stolar had previously suggested that Sega should have sold their company to Microsoft.  In September 2000, in a meeting with Segas Japanese executives and the heads of the companys major Japanese game development studios, Moore and Bellfield recommended that Sega abandon its console business and focus on software—prompting the studio heads to walk out.     Nevertheless, on January 31, 2001, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March 31 and the restructuring of the company as a platform-agnostic third-party developer.  The decision was Moores. Sega also announced a Dreamcast price reduction to $99 to eliminate its unsold inventory, which was estimated at 930,000 units as of April 2001.  After a further reduction to $79, the Dreamcast was cleared out of stores at $49.95.

Okawa, who had previously loaned Sega $500 million in the summer of 1999, died on March 16, 2001; shortly before his death, he forgave Segas debts to him and returned his $695 million worth of Sega and CSK stock, helping the company survive the third-party transition.  As part of this restructuring, nearly one-third of Segas Tokyo workforce was laid off in 2001.      9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide. After the Dreamcasts discontinuation, commercial games were still developed and released for the system, particularly in Japan. In the United States, game releases continued until the end of the first half of 2002. Sega of Japan continued to repair Dreamcast units until 2007.

Perhaps the most frequently cited reason is the damage to Segas reputation caused by several previous poorly supported Sega platforms.
