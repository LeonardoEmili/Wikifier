Following Escoms purchase of Commodore in 1996, the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo.     Early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer.

After Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, an active Amiga community continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine,  Amiga Format , continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine,  Amiga Active , was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. In spite of declining interest in the platform, there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine  Micro Mart .     Several notable magazines are in publication today: Amiga Future, which is available in both English and German; Bitplane.it, a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and AmigaPower, a long-running French magazine.     Online Amiga magazines still exists like , a French publication available since 1997.
