It can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases: if a container, with a fixed number of molecules inside, is reduced in volume, more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time, causing a greater pressure.     A statement of Boyles law is as follows:     :The volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely related to pressure when the temperature is constant.     The concept can be represented with these formulae:     : V \\propto \\frac , meaning Volume is inversely proportional to Pressure , or   : P \\propto \\frac , meaning Pressure is inversely proportional to Volume , or   : PVk_42 , or   : P_42 V_42P_42 V_42\\,     :where P is the pressure, and V is the volume of a gas, and k 42 is the constant in this equation .

If the number of gas molecules and the temperature remain constant, then the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
