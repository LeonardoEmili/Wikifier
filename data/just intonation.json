Pythagorean tuning may be regarded as a three-limit tuning system, because the ratios can be expressed as a product of integer powers of only whole numbers less than or equal to 3.            A twelve-tone scale can also be created by compounding harmonics up to the fifth. Namely, by multiplying the frequency of a given reference note  by powers of 2, 3, or 5, or a combination of them. This method is called five-limit tuning.     To build such a twelve-tone scale , we may start by constructing a table containing fifteen pitches:          The factors listed in the first row and column are powers of 3 and 5, respectively .

For instance, the base ratio for the lower-left cell is 1/9  ×  1/5    1/45.   The base ratio is then multiplied by a negative or positive power of 2, as large as needed to bring it within the range of the octave starting from C . For instance, the base ratio for the lower left cell is multiplied by 2 6 , and the resulting ratio is 64:45, which is a number between 1:1 and 2:1.

Moreover, each row of the table may be considered to be a sequence of fifths , and each column a sequence of major thirds . For instance, in the first row of the table, there is an ascending fifth from D and A, and another one from A to E. This suggests an alternative but equivalent method for computing the same ratios. For instance, one can obtain A, starting from C, by moving one cell to the left and one upward in the table, which means descending by a fifth and ascending by a major third:     : ×   .     Since this is below C, one needs to move up by an octave to end up within the desired range of ratios :     : ×   .     A 12-tone scale is obtained by removing one note for each couple of enharmonic notes.

        " worked in Berlin to develop a different accidental-based method, the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation.  Following the method of notation suggested by Helmholtz in his classic On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music , incorporating Ellis invention of cents, and continuing Johnstons step into Extended JI , Sabat and Schweinitz consider each prime dimension of harmonic space to be represented by a unique symbol. In particular they take the conventional flats, naturals and sharps as a Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F proceeds C-G-D-A-E-B-F and so on.     For higher primes, additional signs have been designed. To facilitate quick estimation of pitches, cents indications may be added . The convention used is that the cents written refer to the tempered pitch implied by the flat, natural, or sharp sign and the note name. A complete legend and fonts for the notation are open source and available from Plainsound Music Edition.  For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E while the just major third is C-E↓.     One of the great advantages of such notation systems is that they allow the natural harmonic series to be precisely notated.     Sagittal notation is a system of arrow-like accidentals that indicate prime-number comma alterations to tones in a Pythagorean series. It is used to notate both just intonation and equal temperaments. The size of the symbol indicates the size of the alteration. ": null
