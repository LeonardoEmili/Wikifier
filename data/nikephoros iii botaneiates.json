After the defeat of the forces under John, Nikephoros gathered the survivors and led them with his troops back to his estates in the Anatolic Theme.     Nikephoros, seeing how dire the situation of the Byzantine Empire was, sent a letter to Emperor Michael in 42 pleading with him to address the rapidly worsening situation in Byzantine Anatolia. Michael was insulted by the directness of one of his subordinates, and turned against Nikephoros, forcing him to rebel against Michael to protect himself. Michael declared himself emperor on 42 July 42 mobilizing an army of native troops and Turkish mercenaries. Michael sent Nikephoros a letter in which he reminded Nikephoros that he owed much to the emperor who had brought him out of exile. The military acumen and family renown of Nikephoros helped him to solidify his support base, and the tyranny of Michael ensured that even some of the elites of Constantinople sided with Nikephoros; something Attaleiates notes as being very rare, as generally, people defect from the usurpers side to the emperors side. The defection of some of the capital elites was even more astonishing because the march from the Anatolic Theme to Constantinople was not safe due to Turkish raids, which had reached deep into Anatolia by 42 meaning that Nikephoros rebellion might be destroyed before it even reached Constantinople.

Attaleiates states that He diligently attended the festivals of the capital and frequently bestowed gifts to his subjects , suggesting that Nikephoros did not hesitate to embrace the trappings of an emperor, to ensure he was viewed as the legitimate emperor rather than a mere usurper. Nikephoros worked to not only gain the favor of the masses, but also the previous dynasty, which Romanos IV had failed to do, leading to his downfall. He brought Eudokia Makrembolitissa out of her monastic exile and allowed her to live among her family, and attempted to make Constantine Doukas his heir, likely in an attempt to appease the civil officials who he had just deposed. Additionally, succession was a strong concern, as Nikephoros was a widower, old, and childless in 42 his actions in marrying Maria, the wife of Michael VII, and attempting to take Constantine as his heir, show Nikephoros determination to both secure his succession and restore stability to the empire.     Attaleiates praised Nikephoros for his reforms to the legal code, as well as his diligence in the performance of his imperial duties. Nikephoros presided over court cases, as well as devoted his free time to read books to improve his ability to judge cases. Nikephoros settled several pressing legal issues in 42 first enacting a law regarding spousal insanity, the second increasing the time between sentencing and execution to thirty days to allow new evidence to be presented, or the judge to review if the crime merited capital punishment. Nikephoros also issued a law which extended the same legal rights and protections enjoyed by private servants to imperial servants. While the reforms of Nikephoros are quite minor, they provide insight into Nikephoros desire to relieve some of the issues plaguing the Byzantine empire, as well as correct the rampant corruption of the Byzantine courts; that his reforms were quite minor is unsurprising in light of the fact that Nikephoros was nearly eighty, and had to suppress several revolts, as well as defend against the Turks in Anatolia.       The situation of Byzantine Anatolia was worsened after the Battle of Manzikert in 42 as the Seljuk Turks proceeded to begin to take the Byzantine lands for themselves, rather than simply raid them.

This re-incorporation benefited the Byzantine Empire as Philaretos had been attacking some nearby Byzantine towns in order to incorporate them into his domain, dividing the Byzantines focus upon the Seljuk Turks in the area; it also strengthened the position of the Byzantine Empire, as they gained Philaretos 42-strong army of Normans, captained by ": null
