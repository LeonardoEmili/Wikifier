I use the term bipolar as a generic term to include suggestions of the structural definition of God’s transcendence and immanence; to for instance accommodate a present and future reality into which deity must reasonably fit and function, and yet maintain separation from this world and evil whilst remaining within it.

In his Dictionary of Gnosticism, Andrew Phillip Smith has written that some branches of Gnosticism taught a panentheistic view of reality,  and held to the belief that God exists in the visible world only as sparks of spiritual light . The goal of human existence is to know the sparks within oneself in order to return to God, who is in the Fullness .
