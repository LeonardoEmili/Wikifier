However, the franchise did not gain more widespread recognition until after the 1993 release of LucasArts  Sam & Max Hit the Road , which cultivated interest in Purcells original comics. Sam & Max Hit the Road is regarded as an exceptional adventure game and an iconic classic of computer gaming in the 1990s. Subsequent video games and the television series have also fared well with both critics and fans; critics consider the episodic video games to be the first successful application of the episodic distribution model.              The idea of Sam & Max originated with Steve Purcells younger brother, Dave, who invented the concept of a comic about a detective team consisting of a dog and a rabbit in his youth.

Over time, this developed from Steve merely mocking his brothers work to him creating his own full stories with the characters. Ultimately, in the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters, signing them over in a contract on Steves birthday and allowing him to develop the characters in his own way.

This creates a seeming disregard for self-preservation; Max will revel in dangerous situations with little impression that he understands the risks he faces. As a result, Max is usually enthusiastic to engage in any activity, including being used by Sam as a cable cutter or an impromptu bludgeon.

        ", the series ran for 24 episodes.  Each episode was approximately ten minutes, and were often aired in pairs.  Broadcast on Fox Kids in the United States, YTV in Canada, and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, the first episode was aired on October 4, 1997; the series concluded on April 25, 1998. As opposed to the more adult humor in the rest of the series, The Adventures of Sam & Max: Freelance Police was aimed more at children, even though some humor in it was often directed at adults. As such, the violence inherent in the franchise is toned down, including removing Sam and Maxs guns, and the characters do not use the moderate profanity that they use in their other appearances. As in most Sam & Max stories, the series revolves around the Freelance Police accepting missions from their mysterious superior, the commissioner, and embarking on cases to a large variety of implausible locations. Sam is voiced by Harvey Atkin , while Max is voiced by Robert Tinkler . The series performed well and was considered a success, and in 1998 received the Gemini Award for Best Animated Program or Series . Despite the series success, a second series was never commissioned. In June 2007, it was reported that Shout! Factory were preparing a DVD release of the series. In October 2007, as part of their marketing for Sam & Max Save the World, GameTap hosted the series on their website. The DVD release of the series was later published in March 2008.       The Sam & Max franchise features a variety of soundtracks that accompany its video game products. This music is mostly grounded in film noir jazz , incorporating various other styles at certain points, such as Dixieland , waltz and mariachi , usually to support the cartoon nature of the series. The first Sam & Max game, Sam & Max Hit the Road, was one of the first games to feature a fully scored music soundtrack, written by LucasArts composers Clint Bajakian , Michael Land and Peter McConnell . The music was incorporated into the game using Land and McConnells iMUSE engine, which allowed for audio to be synchronized with the visuals. Although the full soundtrack was never released, audio renders of four of the games MIDI tracks were included on the CD version of the game.     For Sam & Max Save the World, Beyond Time and Space, and The Devils Playhouse, Telltale Games contracted composer Jared Emerson-Johnson , a musician whose previous work included composition and sound editing for LucasArts, to write the scores. The soundtracks for the first two games were released in two disc sets after the release of the games themselves; the Season One Soundtrack was published in July 2007, whilst the Season Two Soundtrack was released in September 2008. Emerson-Johnsons scores use live performances as opposed to synthesized music often used elsewhere in the video games industry. Critics reacted positively to Emerson-Johnsons scores, IGN described Emerson-Johnsons work as a breath of fresh air , while 1UP.com praised his work as top-caliber and Music4Games stated that the whimsical nature of is well suited to the Sam & Max universe, which approaches American popular culture with a level of irreverence . Purcell later commented that Emerson-Johnson had seamlessly blended a huge palette of genres and styles , whilst in September 2008, Brendan Q. Ferguson, one of the lead designers on Save the World and Beyond Time and Space, stated that he believed that it was Emerson-Johnsons scores that created the vital atmosphere in the games, noting that prior to the implementation of the soundtracks, playing the games was an unrelenting horror .       thu in 2007     The Sam & Max franchise has been highly successful critically, and is considered an iconic and influential aspect of the video game industry in the 1990s and the adventure game genre. In 2007, Steve Purcell wrote that he was somewhat surprised at the success of his creation, noting that the series had gained a large fan gathering despite the small size of the franchise. As the series contains only a small amount of comics, video games and a short TV series, Purcell commented that there was certainly not enough material to build that relentless traction of an endlessly renewed sitcom or a syndicated comic that has existed since the Korean Conflict . The comics were well received by critics, many praising the humor and style of the stories and characters. However, later commentators have noted that the comic book series did not gain much popularity or recognition until after the release of Sam & Max Hit the Road in 1993; the later episodic video games are seen to have revived interest in the comics again, resulting in the creation of the webcomic The Big Sleep and publication of an anniversary edition of Surfin The Highway.     Upon its release in 1993, Sam & Max Hit the Road was met with near universal acclaim. Critics praised the title for its humor, voice acting, graphics, music and gameplay. It has since come to be regarded as a classic graphic adventure game, one of the most critically successful projects by LucasArts to date. Sam & Max Hit the Road is regularly featured in lists of top games, and was nominated for the 1994 Annie Award for Best Animated CD-ROM , although the award instead went to LucasArts ": null

In addition to a petition of 32,000 signatures objecting to the termination of development on Sam & Max: Freelance Police, both Steve Purcell and the media were critical of LucasArts decision. Purcell stated that he failed to understand quite why the game was cancelled, as he believed the development of the game was proceeding without hindrance, while the media put forward the view that LucasArts was moving to consolidate its position with low business risk ": null

The cancellation of Freelance Police is often cited as the culmination in a perceived decline in the overall adventure game genre, and LucasArts later dismissed many of the designers involved with developing their adventure games, effectively ending their adventure game era .     Although Sam & Max Save the World did not receive the critical acclaim that Sam & Max Hit the Road acquired, it still received a favorable response from critics across its release in 2006 and 2007. Critics praised the games humor, graphics and gameplay, although concerns were voiced over the low difficulty of the puzzles and the effectiveness of the story.
