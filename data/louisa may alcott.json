Bronson Alcotts opinions on education and tough views on child-rearing as well as his moments of mental instability shaped young Alcotts mind with a desire to achieve perfection, a goal of the transcendentalists.  His attitudes towards Alcotts wild and independent behavior, and his inability to provide for his family, created conflict between Bronson Alcott and his wife and daughters.  Abigail resented her husbands inability to recognize her sacrifices and related his thoughtlessness to the larger issue of the inequality of sexes. She passed this recognition and desire to redress wrongs done to women on to Louisa.
