However, several case studies in children have demonstrated the absence of pain in more than half of cases in their pediatric study population, with the most common symptom reported simply as blurriness.   Other remarkable differences between the presentation of adult optic neuritis as compared to pediatric cases include more often unilateral optic neuritis in adults, while children much predominantly present with bilateral involvement.     On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualized by a slit lamp with a high positive lens or by using direct ophthalmoscopy; however, frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis , though it may be swollen in some patients .
