Some of the differences and similarities between Gudrun and Kriemhild in the Scandinavian and continental Germanic traditions can be seen in the following two stanzas taken from original sources. The first is Kriemhilds introduction in the Nibelungenlied:        And this is how Gudrun is described at the end of the Eddic poem  Atlakviða :          The etymology of Gudrun  is straightforward: it consists of two elements.

The etymology of Kriemhild is less clear. The second element is clearly -hild, meaning battle or conflict. There is no consensus about the first element though, and it is also variously spelled Grim- and Crem-. One theory derives it from a root Grīm-  meaning mask. Another theory connects it an otherwise unattested root Krēm-. According to both theories, the form Grim- with a short vowel represents an alteration of the original root to be more similar to the word grim, meaning terrible. Yet another theory derives the first element from a verb similar to Middle High German grimmen, meaning to rage.     In the Scandinavian tradition, Gudruns mother is known as ": null

Nibelungenlied         Kriemhild is the main character of the  Nibelungenlied  : she is the first character to be introduced and the romance ends with her death. The poem is even called Kriemhild in at least one manuscript. It has even been argued that the epic represents a sort of  Bildungsroman  for Kriemhild, as she develops from a relatively mild-manner courtly lady into a forceful and ferocious avenger of her dead husband. Various versions of the text judge her actions differently; in the A and B versions, she is condemned as a vâlendinne for her bloody revenge, but the C version emphasizes her love for her dead husband as her motivation and absolves her of most blame.

Some years pass, and Kriemhild and Siegfried have a son whom they name Gunther. One day, Brunhild, who had been convinced that Siegfried was Gunthers vassal rather than an equal king, convinces Gunther to invite his sister and Siegfried to stay with them at Worms. Initially, Brunhild and Kriemhild get along, but in the private while they are watching a tournament, they soon argue over which of them has the highest ranking husband. Brunhild accuses Kriemhild of being married to a vassal. The queens part in anger. Later, the two queens encounter each other before entering the cathedral at Worms for mass. Brunhild and Kriemhild each insist that they should be allowed to enter the church before the other. Brunhild repeats her accusation that Kriemhild is married to a vassal publicly. Kriemhild then declares that Siegfried, and not Gunther, has taken Brunhilds virginity, displaying Brunhild apparent proof. Kriemhild then enters the church before Brunhild.     Siegfried is forced to publicly deny the accusation to Gunther, and beats Kriemhild to punish her. Brunhild is not satisfied, however, and Hagen convinces Gunther to have Siegfried murdered. Under the pretext that he wants to protect Siegfried, Hagen convinces Kriemhild to reveal the only spot where impenetrable Siegfried may be wounded. Once Siegfried is murdered while hunting with Hagen and Gunther, his body is thrown in front of Kriemhilds bedroom door. Kriemhild quickly realizes that Siegfried was murdered by Gunther and Hagen. Kriemhild sees to Siegfrieds burial and refuses to return to Xanten with Siegfrieds father, instead remaining in Worms near her family and Siegfrieds tomb. Eventually, Gunther and his brothers are able to reconcile with Kriemhild, but she refuses to forgive Hagen. Kriemhild has the hoard of the Nibelungen, which she has inherited after Siegfrieds death, brought to Worms.

Nibelungenklage Nibelungenklage , the sequel to the Nibelungenlied, the poem nevertheless goes to great lengths to absolve her of blame for the catastrophe of the Nibelungenlied. According to the Nibelungenklage, Kriemhild was acting out of true love for Siegfried and the true treachery was that of Hagen. This is underlined by having Hildebrand specifically blame Hagen for the disaster, calling him a vâlant , the male counterpart to the accusation that Kriemhild is a vâlandinne .     Þiðrekssaga  Þiðrekssaga  is written in Old Norse, the majority of the material is translated from German  oral tales, as well as possibly some from German written sources such as the Nibelungenlied. Therefore, it is included here.     In the Thidrekssaga, Grimhild is the daughter of king Aldrian of Niflungaland and Oda, sister of king Gunnar , Gisler , and Gernoz , and half sister of Högni . When Sigurd comes to Gunnars kingdom one day, he marries Grimhild and suggests that Gunnar marry Brunhild. Some time later, Grimhild and Brunhild argue over precedent in the kings hall. Brunhild accuses Grimhild of not even being married to a man of noble birth, whereupon Grimhild reveals that Sigurd and not Gunnar took Brunhilds virginity, showing a ring that Sigurd had given her as proof. Brunhild then agitates for Sigurds murder; once Grimhilds brothers have murdered Sigurd, they place his corpse in her bed.     Some time later, Atli woos Grimhild to be his new wife. Seven years later Grimhild convinces Atli to invite the Burgundians to visit her by mentioning the hoard of the Nibelungen which her brothers had stolen from her. Atli is seized by greed for the hoard and agrees. Once the Burgundians arrive, Grimhild demands the hoard from them, but Högni replies that it was left behind. Grimhild attempts to convince Atlis brother Bloedel and Thidrek to help her take revenge, but both refuse. Finally, she provokes a fight by bringing her and Atlis son into the hall, seating him across from Högni, and telling the son to hit Högni. Högni reacts to a second blow by cutting off the princes head, leading to a terrible massacre. After severe fighting, Gunnar is captured, and Grimhild tells Atli to throw him in a tower full of snakes. Högni now leads the Burgundians, who lock themselves in the kings hall. Grimhild orders the hall set on fire, and in the following battle Gisler and Gernoz die. Grimhild sticks a piece of flaming wood into her dead brothers mouths to see if they are dead, causing an enraged Thidrek to kill her.     The author of the saga has made a number of changes to create a more or less coherent story out of the many oral and possibly written sources that he used to create the saga. The author mentions alternative Scandinavian versions of many of these same tales, and appears to have changed some details to match the stories known by his Scandinavian audience. The sagas version of the downfall of the Burgundians represents a unique mix of elements known from the Norse and continental traditions.     Rosengarten zu Worms   In the  Rosengarten zu Worms  , Kriemhild is the daughter of king Gibeche. She possesses a rose garden that is guarded by twelve heroes, including her fiancé, Siegfried. Desiring to see whether Siegfried can beat Dietrich von Bern in combat, she challenges Dietrich to bring twelve of his own heroes for a day of tournaments in the rose garden. The winner will receive a garland and a kiss from her as a reward. Dietrich accepts the challenge, and the heroes come to Worms. Eventually, all of the Burgundian heroes are defeated, including Siegfried, who flees to Kriemhilds lap in fear when Dietrich starts breathing fire. Dietrichs warrior Ilsan, a monk, punishes Kriemhild for her haughtiness in challenging Dietrich by demanding so many kisses from Kriemhild that his rough beard causes her face to bleed. In one version of the poem, Hagen curses Kriemhild for having provoked the combat.     The poem takes a highly critical judgment of Kriemhild. As in the A and B versions of the Nibelungenlied, she is called a vâlandinne and she derives great joy from watching the knights fight in at times brutal combat.     The name of Kriemhilds father, Gibeche, corresponds to Gjúki in the Scandinavian tradition, and is also found in the Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid and Heldenbuch-Prosa ; this shows the Rosengartens connection to an oral tradition outside of the Nibelungenlied, despite the Rosengartens obvious knowledge of the earlier poem.

In the Heldenbuch-Prosa, Kriemhild is the daughter of king Gibeche and married to Siegfried. She arranges for the disaster at Etzels hall in order to take vengeance on Dietrich von Bern for having killed Siegfried in the rose garden. She provokes the fighting by having her and Etzels son brought into the hall and having the child provoke Hagen, who kills it. This leads to an outbreak of hostilities in which many heroes die. When Dietrich takes Gunther and Hagen prisoner, she cuts off their heads, causing Dietrich to cut her to pieces.     Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid   In the late medieval/early modern heroic ballad  Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid , Kriemhild is the daughter of king Gybich and brother of Gunther, Gyrnot , and Hagen. The name Gybich agrees with the Rosengarten zu Worms and corresponds to the Old Norse Gjúki, and the fact that Hagen is one of Kriemhilds brothers accords with the Thidrekssaga and the Scandinavian tradition as well. This is taken as evidence that these elements of the tradition existed in oral story-telling into the late Middle Ages.     In the middle of the ballad, a dragon abducts Kriemhild from her home in Worms. The dragon holds Kriemhild captive for years in his lair of mount Trachenstein , treating her well. One day it lays its head in her lap and transforms into a man, explaining that she needs to stay with hime for five years. After that time he will marry her and they will travel to hell together. Kriemhild prays to avoid this fate. Finally, Siegfried arrives to save her, but the dragon appears. The dragon forces Siegfried and Kriemhild to flee into the depths of the mountain, where they find the treasure of the Nibelungen and a sword that can cut through the dragons skin. Siegfried defeats the dragon, and Kriemhild and Siegfried return to Worms, where they are married and Siegfried rules together with Kriemhilds brothers.

His presentation of the story is very similar to that found in the Völsunga saga , but is considerably shorter.     Gudrun is introduced as the daughter of Gjúki and Grimhild, full sister to Gunnar and Högni, and half-sister to Guthorm. Gudrun marries Sigurd when he comes to Gjúkis kingdom. When Sigurd returns from aiding Gunnar in his wooing of Brunhild, Sigurd and Gudrun have two children, a son named Sigmund and a daughter named Svanhild. Some time later, Gudrun and Brunhild have a quarrel while washing their hair in a river: Brunhild says that she cannot have the water that touched Gudruns hair touch hers, for she is married to the braver husband. The fight leads Gudrun to reveal that it was Sigurd in Gunnars shape who rode through the flames to woo Brunhild, producing a ring that Sigurd had taken from Brunhild as proof. This knowledge leads Brunhild to agitate for Sigurds murder, which is performed by Gudruns half-brother Guthorm, who also kills the young Sigmund.     Following this, Gudrun is married to king Atli . When Atli invites Gudruns brothers and kills them for their gold, Gudrun kills her two sons by Atli. She makes their skulls into drinking goblets and cooks their hearts, giving them to Atli to eat. She then tells Atli what she has done, and later kills Atli together with Högnis son. She then burns down the hall.     Afterwards, Gudrun tries to drown herself in the sea, but she washes ashore in the land of king Jonak. Jonak marries her and has three sons with her, Sorli, Hamdir, and Erp. Svanhild, Sigurds daughter, is also raised there, before being married to king Jormunrek. When Jormunrek kills Svanhild for adultery, Gudrun tells her sons to kill him, giving them special weapons that could not be pierced by iron. The sons die in the attempt, leading to the extinction of Gjúkis line.     Poetic Edda Poetic Edda , a collection of heroic and mythological Nordic poems, appears to have been compiled around 42 in Iceland, and assembles mythological and heroic songs of various ages. As elsewhere in the Scandinavian tradition, Gudrun is portrayed as the sister of Gunnar and Högni. Depending on the poem Guthorm is either her full brother, step-brother, or half-brother. A sister Gullrönd also appears in one poem.     Generally, none of the poems in the collection is thought to be older than 42 and some appear to have been written in the thirteenth century. It is also possible that apparently old poems have been written in an archaicizing style and that apparently recent poems are reworkings of older material, so that reliable dating is impossible.     Grípisspá Grípisspá , a prophecy that Sigurd receives about his future life and deeds, it is mentioned that Gudrun will be his wife, and that Brunhild will feel insulted by this. The prophecy ends shortly after describing Gudruns grief and blaming her mother Grimhild for the whole debacle.     The poem is probably not very old.     Brot af Sigurðarkviðu Brot af Sigurðarkviðu  is only preserved fragmentarily: the surviving part of the poem tells the story of Sigurds murder. The poem briefly shows Gudruns surprise and grief at Sigurds death, as well as her hostility to Brunhild. She is portrayed as a less important character than Brunhild. The lost part of the poem probably shows Gudrun to reveal Sigurd and Gunnars deception in the wooing.     Guðrúnarkviða I Guðrúnarkviða I , Gudrun lies besides Sigurds corpse but is unable to weep. Two other women attempt to comfort her by telling of their own grief, but it is only when Gudruns sister Gullrönd uncovers Sigurds body and tells her to kiss it that she is able to weep. Gudrun now accuses Gunnar of the murder and denies him any right to Sigurds treasure. She warns that she will avenge her husband. It is implied that if Gudrun had been unable to weep, she may have died.     The poem focuses entirely on Gudruns grief at the death of Sigurd, omitting almost all details surrounding his death. The three women, including Gudruns sister Gullrönd, are probably inventions of the poet.     Sigurðarkviða hin skamma Sigurðarkviða hin skamma  retells the story of Sigurds life from his arrival at Gunnars court to his murder.   Gudrun plays a passive role in the poem. She is shown to wake up in a pool of blood from the dying Sigurd, who then makes a short speech to her blaming Brunhild, predicting the murder of their son, assuring her that he has not slept with Brunhild, and noting that he brothers still live. After this, she disappears from the poem and is only mentioned by Brunhild.     Dráp Niflunga Dráp Niflunga  is a short prose section connecting the death of Sigurd to the following poems about the Burgundians and Atli . Atli, who is Brunhilds brother, blames Gunnar for Brunhilds death, and in order to placate him Gunnar marries Gudrun to Atli. Gudrun must be given a magic potion to make her forget about Sigurd first. Some time later Atli invites Gunnar and Högni intending to betray them and take their gold. Gudrun attempts to warn her brothers, but they come anyway. After they are taken prisoner by Atli, she asks her sons to intervene with their father on Gunnar and Högnis behalf, but they refuse.
