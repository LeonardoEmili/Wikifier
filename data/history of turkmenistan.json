President Berdimuhamedow has called for reform of education, health care and pension systems, and government officials of non-Turkmen ethnic origin who had been sacked by Niyazov have returned to work.      President Berdimuhamedow began to reduce the personality cult surrounding Niyazov and the office of the president. He called for an end to the elaborate pageants of music and dancing that formerly greeted the president on his arrival anywhere, and said that the Turkmen sacred oath , part of which states that the speakers tongue should shrivel if he ever speaks ill of Turkmenistan or its president, should not be recited multiple times a day but reserved for special occasions. Previously the oath was recited at the beginning and end of TV news reports, by students at the beginning of the school day, and at the beginning of virtually all meetings of any official nature that took place in the country.      However, Berdimuhamedow is criticized for building a personality cult of his own . For example, he is the only person whose first name is used in government press releases; other officials always have their first names abbreviated to a single letter. He is also sometimes called the Turkmen leader by his countrys press. Additionally, while his regime is somewhat less heavy-handed than Niyazovs, it is still rigidly authoritarian.     On March 19, 2007, Berdimuhamedow reversed one of Niyazovs most unpopular decrees by giving pensions back to 100,000 elderly people whose pensions Niyazov had slashed in the face of an unspecified budget crisis.      On March 20, in a decision of significant symbolic weight in the ongoing rejection of Niyazovs personality cult, he abolished the power of the president to rename any landmarks, institutions, or cities.
