Among the Brazilian environmental NGOs, the most visible are SOS Atlantic Forest , the Social-Environmental Institute , the Pro-Nature Foundation , and the Amazon Working Group . The Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and Development and the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental Organizations are national networks, and there are various regional and thematic networks as well. The main international environmental NGOs that have offices or affiliates in Brazil are the World Wildlife Fund , Conservation International , and Nature Conservancy.        Especially after the events of the late 42s, international organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources for the environmental sector in Brazil. In 42 environmental projects worth about US$42 million were identified, with US$42 in counterpart funds . More than 42% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that funding was influenced unduly by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.     Among the specific environmental projects with international support, the most important was the National Environmental Plan , which received a US$42 million loan from the World Bank. The National Environmental Fund , in addition to budgetary funds, received US$42 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests was supported by the worlds seven richest countries and the European Community, which allocated USD $42 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility , created in 42 set aside US$42 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rondônia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 42s.     Despite favorable laws, promising institutional arrangements, and external funding, the government has not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it can be attributed to the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 42 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.     Environment - current issues:   ": null
