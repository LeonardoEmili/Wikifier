Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecrafts youth. Tomalin, 9, 17, 24, 27; Sunstein, 11. The familys financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecrafts father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mothers bedroom to protect her. Todd, 11; Tomalin, 19; Wardle, 6; Sunstein, 16. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life.

Wollstonecraft wrote to her: I have formed romantic notions of friendship  ... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none. Quoted in Todd, 16.

Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women—an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of  Thoughts on the Education of Daughters  entitled Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune—she decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become the first of a new genus.

On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined; when Imlay broke the news to Wollstonecraft, she fainted. By this time, Imlay was taking advantage of the British blockade of France, which had caused shortages and worsened ever-growing inflation, by chartering ships to bring food and soap from America and dodge the British Royal Navy, goods that he could sell at a premium to Frenchmen who still had money. Imlays blockade-running gained the respect and support of some Jacobins, ensuring, as he had hoped, his freedom during the Terror. Gordon 215, 224. To protect Wollstonecraft from arrest, Imlay made a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her an American citizen.

There were gigantic daytime parades requiring everyone to show themselves and lustily cheer lest they be suspected of inadequate commitment to the republic, as well as nighttime police raids to arrest enemies of the republic. In a March 1794 letter to her sister Everina, Wollstonecraft wrote:     It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind ... death and misery, in every shape of terrour, haunts this devoted country—I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded.

In 1793, the British government had begun a crackdown on radicals, suspending civil liberties, imposing drastic censorship, and trying for treason anyone suspected of sympathy with the revolution, which led Wollstonecraft to fear she would be imprisoned if she returned.     The winter of 1794–95 was the coldest winter in Europe for over a century, which reduced Wollstonecraft and her daughter Fanny to desperate circumstances. Furniss 67–68. The river Seine froze that winter, which made it impossible for ships to bring food and coal to Paris, leading to widespread starvation and deaths from the cold in the city. Gordon 243. Wollstonecraft continued to write to Imlay, asking him to return to France at once, declaring she still had faith in the revolution and did not wish to return to Britain. After she left France on 7 April 1795, she continued to refer to herself as Mrs Imlay, even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child. Tomalin, 225.     The British historian Tom Furniss called An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution the most neglected of Wollstonecrafts books. It was first published in London in 1794, but a second edition did not appear until 1989. Later generations were more interested in her feminist writings rather than her account of the French Revolution, which Furniss has called her best work. Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian, but she used all sorts of journals, letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the revolution. She was trying to counteract what Furniss called the hysterical anti-revolutionary mood in Britain, which depicted the revolution as due to the entire French nations going mad. Wollstonecraft argued instead that the revolution arose from a set of social, economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789.     An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution was a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft. She condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror, but at same time she argued that the revolution was a great achievement, which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 1793–94. Furniss 68–69. Edmund Burke had ended his Reflections on the Revolution in France with reference to the events of 5–6 October 1789, when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris. Furniss 72. Burke called the women furies from hell, while Wollstonecraft defended them as ordinary housewives angry about the lack of bread to feed their families. Against Burkes idealised portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob, Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a femme fatale, a seductive, scheming and dangerous woman. Callender 384 Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy corrupted women in a monarchy because womens main purpose in such a society was to bear sons to continue a dynasty, which essentially reduced a womans value to her womb. Moreover, Wollstonecraft pointed out that unless a queen was a ": null

        "s, which meant a woman had to exercise influence via her husband or son, encouraging her to become more and more manipulative. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values, by emphasising a womans body and her ability to be charming over her mind and character, had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless, making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the ancien régime.       Seeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her. In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide, probably with ": null

In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia, trying to recoup some of his losses. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as  Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark  in 1796. Tomalin, 225–31; Wardle, 226–44; Sunstein, 277–90. When she returned to England and came to the full realization that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:             She then went out on a rainy night and to make her clothes heavy with water, she walked up and down about half an hour before jumping into the ": null

Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured. Todd, 357.

Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise  Political Justice . St. Clair, 172–74; Tomalin, 271–73; Sunstein, 330–35.

Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial , but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that womens deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: Taught from their infancy that beauty is womans sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 157. She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more. Kelly, 124–26; Taylor, 14–15.     While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. See, for example Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 126, 146. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 110. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 135. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word did not come into existence until the 1890s. The words feminist and feminism were coined in the 1890s. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved 17 September 2007; see Taylor, 12, 55–57, 105–06, 118–20; Sapiro, 257–59.

She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are blown about by every momentary gust of feeling and because they are the prey of their senses they cannot think rationally. Wollstonecraft, Vindications, 177. In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. Jones, 46.     In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the Rights of Woman, On National Education , she argues that all children should be sent to a country day school as well as given some education at home to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures. She also maintains that schooling should be ": null

But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school.

Neither of Wollstonecrafts novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman. At the end of Mary, the heroine believes she is going to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage , Wollstonecraft, Mary, 68. presumably a positive state of affairs.

        ", a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroines indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental. Johnson, 60, 65–66; Kelly, 44; Poovey, 89; Taylor, 135; Todd, Womens Friendship, 210–11.     Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecrafts novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.
