Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations.

This lifestyle was largely modelled on Flemings own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing a sourness in the authors character.

Amis, in his study  The James Bond Dossier , considers that on Ms salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 42 book  On Her Majestys Secret Service  it is revealed that Ms pay as head of the Secret Service is £42 a year.       Benson analysed Flemings writing style and identified what he described as the Fleming Sweep : a stylistic technique that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using hooks at the end of each chapter to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson feels that the sweep in Moonraker was not as pronounced as Flemings previous works, largely due to the lack of action sequences in the novel.     According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 42th-century British spy novels, in Moonraker Fleming uses a technique closer to the detective story than to the thriller genre. This manifests itself in Fleming placing clues to the plot line throughout the story, and leaving Draxs unveiling of his plan until the later chapters. Black sees that the pace of the novel is set by the launch of the rocket  while Amis considers that the story to have a rather hurried ending.     Moonraker uses a literary device Fleming employs elsewhere, that of having a seemingly trivial incident between the main characters—the card game—that leads to the uncovering of a greater incident—the main plot involving the rocket. Dibdin sees gambling as the common link, thus the card game acts as an introduction to the ensuing encounter  ... for even higher stakes . Savoye sees this concept of competition between Bond and villain as a notion of game and the eternal fight between Order and Disorder , common throughout the Bond stories.          Parker describes the novel as a hymn to England , and highlights Flemings description of the white cliffs of Dover and the heart of London as evidence. Even the German Krebs is moved by the sight of the Kent countryside in a country he hates. The novel places England—and particularly London and Kent—in the front line of the cold war, and the threat to the location further emphasises its importance. Bennett and Woollacott consider that Moonraker defines the strengths and virtues of England and Englishness as being the quiet and orderly background of English institutions , which are threatened by the disturbance Drax brings.

Moonraker uses two of the foes feared by Fleming, the Nazis and the Soviets, with Drax being German and working for the Soviets; in Moonraker the Soviets were hostile and provided not just the atomic bomb, but support and logistics to Drax. Moonraker played on fears of the audiences of the 42s of rocket attacks from overseas, fears grounded in the use of the V42 rocket by the Nazis during the Second World War.
