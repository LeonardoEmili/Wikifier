As the years passed, Bok became prone to disagreements with editors over money and artistic issues; he grew reclusive and mystical, and preoccupied with the occult.

Campells fantasy magazine  Unknown ; and The Blue Flamingo/Beyond the Golden Stair. The Blue Flamingo first appeared in the January 1948 issue of  Startling Stories .

His style could alternate between, or combine, lush romanticism and humorous grotesquery. His use of time-consuming glazing techniques for his paintings impeded his productivity and limited his output, and therefore his commercial success. He also spent time carving figures in wood and making masks in  papier mache . In the 1950s he was able to do more book-jacket illustrations, which he found less irksome than magazine work; though he could never have abandoned the latter.

Bok and Petajas friendship continued in Los Angeles, where each had relocated in 1937. Throughout 1937 and 1938, Petaja and Bok shared an apartment, and together they attended fan meetings, haunted second-hand book and magazine shops, went to the movies, and helped each other with their poems and stories. They also immersed themselves in the primordial Los Angeles science fiction scene. Bok and Petaja befriended Ray Bradbury – then still a teenager – as well as Forrest J. Ackerman, ": null

In And Flights of Angels, Petaja recounts: Perhaps when all is washed down over the dam, my major claim to fame will rest in the fact that it was I who got Hannes down to Los Angeles and I who dragged him, reluctantly, to the meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society. Where we met Ray Bradbury. . . . It was at Cliftons Cafeteria on Broadway. We couldnt afford to eat there, usually, but we took advantage of the free lime sherbet. In that fabled back room where so many of the s-f elite have sat around the long table chewing the fat, fanwize, Hannes first met Forrie Ackerman, Henry Kuttner, et al. But it was Ray Bradbury who took to Hannes instanter and proved to be such a rare and wonderful friend to him a little later on.     Besides introducing Hannes to Ray Bradbury, I take pride in the fact that this brief Los Angeles period of Boks life was one of the most productive of his life. He produced a dozen color paintings based on ": null

All of which does indicate that, for all his beefs, he was happy then. He might lash out cruelly about this or that, but nobody I have known had as great a capacity for enjoying and sensating all there was around him.     In 1967, three years after Boks death, Petaja founded the Bokanalia Memorial Foundation. The foundation was set up with the help and encouragement of Harold Taves of Seattle and Ray Bradbury of Los Angeles and the Golden Gate Futurians of San Francisco . . . . The avowed intention of Bokanalia is simply to keep the great imaginative art of Hannes Bok from slipping into oblivion, and to make new prints available to his many admirers all over the world .     Between 1967 and 1970, Petaja published five portfolios of Boks art. Those portfolios include Variations on Bok Theme, ; The Famous Power Series, ; and A Memorial Portfolio, . Petaja also authored a commemorative volume, And Flights of Angels: The Life and Legend of Hannes Bok . Along with brief contributions from ": null

Much of the Bok material included in the portfolios and books published and authored by Petaja came from Petajas personal collection.
