The A-Team is a naturally episodic show, with few overarching stories, except the characters continuing motivation to clear their names, with few references to events in past episodes and a recognizable and steady episode structure. In describing the ratings drop that occurred during the shows fourth season, reviewer Gold Burt points to this structure as being a leading cause for the decreased popularity because the same basic plot had been used over and over again for the past four seasons with the same predictable outcome .  Similarly, reporter Adrian Lee called the plots stunningly simple in a 2006 article for  The Express  , citing such recurring elements as BAs fear of flying, and outlandish finales when the team fashioned weapons from household items .

Baracus affects a dislike for Murdock, calling him a crazy fool , but his true feelings of friendship are revealed when he prevents Murdock from drowning in his desire to live like a fish. Baracus also has a deep fear of flying, and the others usually have to trick and/or knock him out in order to get him on an aircraft. It is very rare that Baracus is awake while flying, and even rarer for him actually to consent to it. When he does, however, he then goes into a catatonic state. Baracus generally wears overalls and leopard or tiger print shirts in the early seasons, and wears a green jumpsuit in the later seasons. He is almost always seen with many gold chains and rings on every finger, and also wears a weightlifting belt. Baracus hairstyle is always in a mohawk-like cut. He drives a customized black GMC van that acts as the teams usual mode of transport.     H.M. Howling Mad Murdock is the A-Teams pilot, and can fly any kind of aircraft with considerable skill. However, due to a helicopter crash in Vietnam, Murdock apparently went insane. He lives in a Veterans Hospital in the mental wing. Whenever the rest of the team requires a pilot, they have to break him out of the hospital, generally using Faceman to do so. In Seasons 1â€“4, Murdock has a different pet, imaginary friend, or alter-ego in each episode. Whenever one of his pets or imaginary friends is killed by an enemy, Murdock snaps and takes revenge . Many times, when Baracus is mad at Murdock for being crazy, Hannibal will side with Murdock in a sympathetic way. Once he is discharged from the hospital in Season 5, Murdock has a different job each episode. Murdock usually wears a leather flight jacket, a baseball cap, and basketball sneakers.

These were the highest ratings NBC had achieved in five years.  During the second season, the ratings continued to soar, reaching third place in the twenty-highest rated programs, behind  Dallas  and  Simon & Simon , in January ,  while during the third season, it was beaten out only by four other NBC shows, including  The Cosby Show .     The fourth season saw The A-Team experience a dramatic fall in ratings, as it started to lose its position while television viewership increased. As such, the ratings, while stable, were relatively less. The season premiere ranked a 17.4% on the Nielsen Rating scale,  but after ratings quickly declined. In October, The A-Team had fallen to the 19th and by Super Bowl Night had fallen still to 29th the night on which the show had originally scored its first hit three years before.  For the remainder of its fourth season The A-Team managed to hang around the 20th spot, far from original top 10 position it had enjoyed during its first three seasons.     After four years on Tuesday, NBC decided to move The A-Team to a new timeslot on Friday for what would be its final season. Ratings continued to drop, and after seven episodes, The A-Team fell out of the top 50 altogether with a 13.3 Nielsen Rating.

Most reviews focused on acting and the formulaic nature of the episodes, most prominently the absence of actual killing in a show about Vietnam War veterans.     The show was a huge hit in Italy in the mid-1980s to the 1990s.                The violence presented in The A-Team is highly sanitized. People do not bleed or bruise when hit , nor do the members of the A-Team kill people. The results of violence were only ever presented when it was required for the script. In almost every car crash there is a short take showing the occupants of the vehicle climbing out of the mangled or burning wreck, even in helicopter crashes. However, more of these types of takes were dropped near the end of the fourth season. According to Stephen J. Cannell, this part of the show did become a running joke for the writing staff and they would at times test the limits of realism on purpose.  Bring Back... The A-Team , Stephen J. Cannell. Broadcast on May 18, 2006.     The show has been described as cartoonish and likened to  Tom and Jerry . Dean P. of the  Courier-Mail  described the violence in the show as hypocritical and that the morality of giving the impression that a hail of bullets does no-one any harm is ignored. After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects.  Television reviewer ": null

        " . Encyclopedia Mysteriosa, p. 1. MacMillan, 1994, . According to certain estimates, an episode of the A-Team held up to 46 violent acts. Stephen J. Cannell, co-creator of the show responds: They were determined to make a point, and we were too big a target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue. Originally, The A-Teams status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as  The Cosby Show ,  Whos the Boss?  and  Growing Pains . John J. OConnor of  The New York Times  wrote in a 1986 article that ...a substantial number of viewers, if the ratings in recent months are to be believed, are clearly fed up with mindless violence of the car-chasing, fist-slugging variety .           During its tenure, the show was occasionally criticized for being sexist. These critiques were based on the notion that most female roles on the show were either a lead-in to the episodes plot, the recipient of Faces affections, or both. The only two regular female members of the cast, Melinda Culea and Marla Heasley did not have long tenures with the show. Both Culea and Heasley had been brought in by the network and producers to stem these critiques, hoping that a female character would properly balance the otherwise all-male cast.  Bring Back...

Culeas character of Amy Allen suddenly disappeared between two episodes, and was only briefly referred to once in the episode In Plane Sight , and a couple of times in The Battle of Bel Air in which she was cited to have taken a correspondence job overseas . The latter episode also introduced Heasleys character, Tawnia Baker. The new character was also an assisting reporter character, but with a more fragile and seductive quality to her. Ultimately, she was written out of the show at the start of the third season when the network determined that a female cast member was not necessary. Tawnia left the team on-screen, choosing to marry and move out of Los Angeles.     As Marla Heasley recounts in  Bring Back... The A-Team  , although sexism was not prevalent on the set per se, there was a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her We dont want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason youre here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl. The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: Im sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didnt want a girl, has nothing to do with you.

A number of devices were seen in the back of the van in different episodes, including a mini printing press , an audio surveillance recording device , Hannibals disguise kits in various episodes, and a gun storage locker.     Early examples of the van had a red GMC logo on the front grille, and an additional GMC logo on the rear left door. Early in the second season, these logos were blacked out, although GMC continued to supply vans and receive a credit on the closing credits of each episode.     The van was almost all-black, as the section above the red stripe was metallic gray. The angle of the rear spoiler can also be seen to vary on different examples of the van within the series. Additionally, some versions of the van have a sunroof, whereas others, typically those used for stunts do not. This led to continuity errors in some episodes, such as in the third seasons The Bells of St. Marys , in a scene where Face jumps from a building onto the roof of the van with no sunroof but moments later, in an interior studio shot, climbs in through the sunroof.
