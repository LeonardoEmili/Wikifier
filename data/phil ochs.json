With an ironic sense of humor, Ochs included Christgaus webbed hand comment in his 1968 songbook The War is Over on a page titled The Critics Raved , opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a large metal garbage can. Ochs , p. 44. Despite his sense of humor, Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for. Schumacher, p. 166.

It reached 119 on  Billboard s national Hot Prospect listing before being pulled from some radio stations because of its lyrics, which sarcastically suggested that smoking marijuana is more fun than drinking beer . Eliot , pp. 136–137. It was the closest Ochs ever came to the Top 40. Joan Baez, however, did have a Top Ten hit in the U.K. in August 1965, reaching 8 with her cover of Ochss song There but for Fortune , which was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording . In the U.S. it peaked at 50 on the Billboard charts —a good showing, but not a hit. Schumacher, p. 95.     Although he was trying new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots. He was profoundly concerned with the escalation of the Vietnam War, performing tirelessly at anti-war rallies across the country. In 1967 he organized two rallies to declare that The War Is Over — Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, friends, do what I and thousands of other Americans have done—declare the war over. ; reprinted in Ochs , p. 92; excerpted in Schumacher, p. 171. —one in Los Angeles in June, the other in New York in November. Schumacher, pp. 139–148, 170–173. He continued to write and record anti-war songs, such as The War Is Over and White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land . Other topical songs of this period include Outside of a Small Circle of Friends , inspired by the murder of Kitty Genovese , who was stabbed to death outside of her New York City apartment building while dozens of her neighbors reportedly ignored her cries for help, and William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed , about the despair he felt in the aftermath of the Chicago 1968 Democratic National Convention police riot . Schumacher, pp. 149, 208.     Ochs was writing more personal songs as well, such as Crucifixion , in which he compared the deaths of Jesus Christ and assassinated President John F. Kennedy as part of a cycle of sacrifice in which people build up heroes and then celebrate their destruction; Chords of Fame , a warning against the dangers and corruption of fame; Pleasures of the Harbor , a lyrical portrait of a lonely sailor seeking human connection far from home; and Boy in Ohio , a plaintive look back at Ochss childhood in Columbus. Eliot , p. 193. Schumacher, pp. 110, 160, 214–215, 223–224.     A lifelong movie fan, Ochs worked the narratives of justice and rebellion that he had seen in films into his music, describing some of his songs as cinematic .

        ":     re we have John Wayne, who was a major artistic and psychological figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... a certain sense of honor what the soldier was doing. ... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of what it meant to be a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty. ... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, Im sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general. ; quoted in Schumacher, p. 178.     Ochs was involved in the creation of the Youth International Party , known as the Yippies, along with Jerry Rubin , Abbie Hoffman , Stew Albert , and Paul Krassner . Eliot , p. 140. At the same time, Ochs actively supported Eugene McCarthy s more mainstream bid for the 1968 Democratic nomination for President , a position at odds with the more radical Yippie point of view. Schumacher, p. 182–184. Despite their disagreements, the Yippies used several Ochs songs in their media, in particular the anti-war I Aint Marching Anymore . For example, see . Still, Ochs helped plan the Yippies Festival of Life which was to take place at the 1968 Democratic National Convention along with demonstrations by other anti-war groups including the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam . Brend, pp. 106–107. Despite warnings that there might be trouble, Ochs went to Chicago both as a guest of the McCarthy campaign and to participate in the demonstrations. He performed in Lincoln Park , Grant Park , and at the Chicago Coliseum , witnessed the violence perpetrated by the Chicago police against the protesters, and was himself arrested at one point.

At the trial of the Chicago Seven in December 1969, Ochs testified for the defense. His testimony included his recitation of the lyrics to his song I Aint Marching Anymore . On his way out of the courthouse, Ochs sang the song for the press corps; to Ochss amusement, his singing was broadcast that evening by Walter Cronkite on the CBS Evening News . Eliot , pp. 175–188.       After the riot in Chicago and the subsequent trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public. Schumacher, pp. 222–223.     Ochs turned to his musical roots in country music and early rock and roll. Schumacher, p. 224.

This new Phil Ochs drew a hostile reaction from his audience.

He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, and he was also drinking heavily. Schumacher, pp. 216–217, 233. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around—so many pills. Id never seen anything like that. Schumacher, p. 233. Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice for the rest of his life. Eliot , pp. 207, 213, 236. Schumacher, pp. 260, 265, 275, 301–302, 310–311.     Depressed by his lack of widespread appreciation and suffering from writers block , Ochs did not record any further albums. Schumacher, pp. 226, 235, 255. He slipped deeper into depression and alcoholism. His personal problems notwithstanding, Ochs performed at the inaugural benefit for Greenpeace on October 16, 1970, at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver , British Columbia . A recording of his performance, along with performances by Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, was released by Greenpeace in 2009.       thu into Heres to the State of Richard Nixon . Typed at apartment of Chip Berlet in 1974 prior to Ochss performance of the song at Impeachment Ball. Copy sent to his brother Michael Ochs for registration. Original at Chicago History Museum .     In August 1971, Ochs went to Chile, where Salvador Allende , a Marxist , had been democratically elected in the 1970 election . There he met Chile an folksinger Víctor Jara , an Allende supporter, and the two became friends. In October, Ochs left Chile to visit Argentina . Later that month, after singing at a political rally in Uruguay , he and his American traveling companion David Ifshin were arrested and detained overnight. When the two returned to Argentina, they were arrested as they got off the airplane. After a brief stay in an Argentinian prison, Ochs and Ifshin were sent to Bolivia via a commercial airliner where authorities were to detain them. Ifshin had previously been warned by Argentinian leftist friends that when the authorities sent dissidents to Bolivia, they would disappear forever. When the airliner arrived in Bolivia, the American captain of the Braniff International Airways aircraft allowed Ochs and Ifshin to stay on the aircraft, and barred Bolivian authorities from entering. The aircraft then flew to Peru where the two disembarked and they were not detained. Fearful that Peruvian authorities might arrest him, Ochs returned to the United States a few days later. Schumacher, pp. 239–253.     Ochs was having difficulties writing new songs during this period, but he had occasional breakthroughs. He updated his sarcastic song Heres to the State of Mississippi as Heres to the State of Richard Nixon , with cutting lines such as the speeches of the Spiro are the ravings of a clown , a reference to Nixons vitriolic vice president, Spiro Agnew —sung as the speeches of the President are the ravings of a clown after Agnews resignation. Schumacher, p. 255. Eliot, p. 216. The Spiro lyrics can be heard in from the 1971 Free John Sinclair rally. The President lyrics can be heard in the 1974 single release.     Ochs was personally invited by John Lennon to sing at a large benefit at the University of Michigan in December 1971 on behalf of John Sinclair , an activist poet who had been arrested on minor drug charges and given a severe sentence. Ochs performed at the John Sinclair Freedom Rally along with Stevie Wonder , Allen Ginsberg , David Peel , Abbie Hoffman and many others. The rally culminated with Lennon and Yoko Ono , who were making their first public performance in the United States since the breakup of The Beatles . Schumacher, pp. 256–259.     Although the 1968 election had left him deeply disillusioned, Ochs continued to work for the election campaigns of anti-war candidates, such as George McGovern s unsuccessful Presidential bid in 1972 .

Schumacher, pp. 263–264, 269, 271.     Ochs decided to travel. In mid-1972, he went to Australia and New Zealand . Schumacher, pp. 264–271. He traveled to Africa in 1973, where he visited Ethiopia , Kenya , Tanzania , Malawi , and South Africa . One night, Ochs was attacked and strangled by robbers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania , which damaged his vocal cords, causing a loss of the top three notes in his vocal range. The attack also exacerbated his growing mental problems, and he became increasingly paranoid. Ochs believed the attack may have been arranged by government agents—perhaps the CIA. Still, he continued his trip, even recording a single in Kenya, Bwatue . Schumacher, pp. 279–285.     On September 11, 1973, the Allende government of Chile was overthrown in a ": null

        ". Allende committed suicide during the bombing of the presidential palace, and singer Victor Jara was publicly tortured and killed. When Ochs heard about the manner in which his friend had been killed, he was outraged and decided to organize a benefit concert to bring to public attention the situation in Chile, and raise funds for the people of Chile. The concert, An Evening with Salvador Allende , included films of Allende; singers such as Pete Seeger , Arlo Guthrie , and Bob Dylan; and political activists such as former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark . Dylan had agreed to perform at the last minute when he heard that the concert had sold so few tickets that it was in danger of being canceled. Once his participation was announced, the event quickly sold out. Schumacher, pp. 287–297.     After the Chile benefit, Ochs and Dylan discussed the possibility of a joint concert tour, playing small nightclubs. Nothing came of the Dylan-Ochs plans, but the idea eventually evolved into Dylans Rolling Thunder Revue . Schumacher, pp. 298–299.     The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975. Ochs planned a final War Is Over rally, which was held in New Yorks Central Park on May 11. More than 100,000 people came to hear Ochs, joined by Harry Belafonte , Odetta , Pete Seeger and others. Ochs and Joan Baez sang a duet of There but for Fortune and he closed with his song The War Is Over —finally a true declaration that the war was over. Schumacher, pp. 304–306.       thu in Washington, D.C., in 1975   Ochss drinking became more and more of a problem, and his behavior became increasingly erratic. He frightened his friends both with his drunken rants about the FBI and CIA , and about his claiming to want to have Elviss manager Colonel Tom Parker or Kentucky Fried Chicken s Colonel Sanders manage his career. Schumacher, pp. 310–311.     In mid-1975, Ochs took on the identity of John Butler Train. He told people that Train had murdered Ochs, and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Train was convinced that someone was trying to kill him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, a knife, or a lead pipe. Schumacher, pp. 312–318     Ochss friends tried to help him. His brother Michael attempted to have him committed to a psychiatric hospital . Friends pleaded with him to get help voluntarily. They feared for his safety, because he was getting into fights with bar patrons. Unable to pay his rent, he began living on the streets. Schumacher, pp. 327–333.     After several months, the Train persona faded and Ochs returned, but his talk of suicide disturbed his friends and family. They hoped it was a passing phase, but Ochs was determined. Schumacher, pp. 339–341. One of his biographers explains Ochss motivation:         In January 1976, Ochs moved to Far Rockaway, New York, to live with his sister Sonny. He was lethargic; his only activities were watching television and playing cards with his nephews. Ochs saw a psychiatrist, who diagnosed his bipolar disorder . He was prescribed medication, and he told his sister he was taking it. After Ochss death, his sister found he had been lying about taking his medication. Schumacher, p. 349. On April 9, 1976, Ochs committed suicide by hanging himself in Sonnys home. Schumacher, pp. 344–352.     Years after his death, it was revealed that the FBI had a file of nearly 500 pages on Ochs. Blair, p. 4. Much of the information in those files relates to his association with counterculture figures, protest organizers, musicians, and other people described by the FBI as subversive . Eliot , pp. 301–308. The FBI was often sloppy in collecting information on Ochs: his name was frequently misspelled Oakes in their files, and they continued to consider him potentially dangerous Schumacher, p. 355. after his death.

My affection no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth that many observers who care more for folk music than I do remember both his compositions and his vibrato tenor as close to the peak of the genre.       Over forty years after his death, Ochss songs remain relevant. Ochs continues to influence singers and fans worldwide, most of whom never saw him perform live. There are mailing lists and online discussion groups dedicated to Ochs and his music; websites that have music samples, photographs, and other links; and articles and books continue to be written and published about him. Examples include , , and     Phil Ochss commitment to fighting against the Vietnam War started early. In 1964, Phil Ochs performed his song Talking Vietnam Blues, the first protest song to directly refer to Vietnam by name.     His sister, Sonny Ochs , runs a series of Phil Ochs Song Nights with a rotating group of performers who keep Ochss music and legacy alive by singing his songs in cities across the U.S. Michael Ochs is a photographic archivist of 20th-century music and entertainment personalities.
