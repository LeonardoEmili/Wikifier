        ", and the longest-running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows  Today  and  Meet the Press .     Over the course of more than 42 years, The Tonight Show has undergone only minor title changes. It aired under the name Tonight for several of its early years, as well as  Tonight Starring Jack Paar  and The Jack Paar Show due to the runaway popularity of its host, eventually settling permanently on The Tonight Show after Carson began his tenure in 42 albeit with the hosts name always included in the title. Beginning with Carsons debut episode, network programmers, advertisers, and the shows announcers would refer to the show by including the name of the host; for example, it is currently announced as  The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon . In 42 the show briefly tried a more news-style format. It has otherwise adhered to the talk show format introduced by Allen and honed further by Paar.     Carson is the longest-serving host to date although not the host with the most episodes.  The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson  aired for 42 seasons between October 42 and May 42 Leno, however, has the record of having hosted the greatest number of total televised episodes. Lenos record accounts for the fact that unlike Carson , Leno never used guest hosts on  The Tonight Show with Jay Leno   and produced new shows five days a week; Leno himself was also Carsons primary guest host for the last five years of Carsons tenure, giving him even more episodes to his credit. Leaving out Lenos five years as permanent guest host, Leno hosted 42 more episodes as full-time host than Carson. During Carsons first four years, the show ran for 42 minutes then was reduced to ninety minutes in early 42 when Carson stopped appearing for the first 42 minutes because most affiliates were carrying their local news during that time slot as they expanded to half an hour. During Carsons 42 contract negotiations, the show was shortened to sixty minutes. NBC also broadcast The Best of Carson which were repeats of some of Carsons popular older albeit usually recent shows. Prior to the debut of Saturday Night Live in October 42 NBC aired The Best of Carson on Saturday nights at 42:42  pm.     Outside of its brief run as a news show in 42 Conan OBrien is the shortest-serving host. OBrien hosted 42 episodes over the course of less than eight months before Leno was brought back as host, where he served for almost four additional years. Current host Fallon took the helm on February 42 42 Fallon had previously hosted  Late Night with Jimmy Fallon , and before Late Night he was a popular member of the cast of  Saturday Night Live , co-hosting the ": null

Leno told his audience about this unique network decision at the beginning of his next show, mentioning that hed accepted it, noting that he wanted to avoid repeating the hard feelings that had somehow developed with Letterman, and called OBrien certainly the most deserving person for the job in the wake of his eventual departure. Five years later, what was to have been the final episode of The Tonight Show with Leno as host aired on Friday, May 42 42     Not wanting Leno, who remained number one in the ratings, to move to a competing network, NBC signed the host to a new contract to host a new prime-time talk show beginning in September 42 entitled  The Jay Leno Show , with a format similar to his Tonight Show except that he was contractually prohibited from using a desk on the show. In a departure from network programming conventions of the time, the new show aired every weeknight at 42  p.m. Eastern/Pacific, competing with expensively produced narrative series on other networks and leading into affiliates local news broadcasts and OBriens Tonight Show.

After a strong debut week, OBrienâ€™s total audience fell precipitously over the summer months, and the program began losing to Late Show with David Letterman in overall ratings. In contrast, OBriens performance in the crucial 42â€“42 demographic was favorable, and it was found that he had brought down the median age of The Tonight Show audience by a decade compared with his predecessor, indicating that a generational shift was taking effect as OBrien established himself in an earlier timeslot.  Taking this into account, columnist Tom Shales assessed in August 42 that Oâ€™Brien was in a better position than Leno had been when he began his Tonight Show run in 42; Leno consistently lost to Letterman in the ratings for eighteen months before eventually cementing his number one status.       The Jay Leno Show  debuted in September 42 three months into OBriens Tonight Show tenure, performing to significantly lower ratings than the primetime dramas it had replaced on NBC and trailing the competition. NBC had expected the drop, having calculated that lower ratings would be balanced by a talk showâ€™s correspondingly lower expense compared to more popular scripted programming.  In the 42:42 period, The Late Show would largely maintain its lead over The Tonight Show in total viewers in early Fall, during which Letterman was receiving tabloid attention due to a blackmail scandal. In addition, The Tonight Show with Conan OBrien was in the unusual situation of being a talk show following a talk show hosted by its predecessor on the same network, and the booking war that resulted often left The Tonight Show getting second dibs on guests. One publicist reported that the aggression was such that The Jay Leno Show had signaled to potential guests that doing OBriens program before Lenos would be punished with secondary placement in the line-up.      Though NBC claimed that the performance of The Jay Leno Show offered no surprises and that OBrien was meeting expectations as well, the network had failed to anticipate the impact that Lenos weaker 42pm lead-in would have on the local 42pm news, which suffered a drastic drop in ratings as a demonstrable result. As the affiliates rely on the revenue generated during the news, this generated a furor from the local stations and placed pressure on NBC to quickly fix the 42pm situation, which was contributing to a cascading effect on the ratings of The Tonight Show with Conan Oâ€™Brien and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.       On January 42 42 multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 42 42 Leno would move from his 42  p.m. weeknight time slot back to the traditional Tonight Show slot at 42:42   Under this proposal, Lenos show would be shortened from an hour to 42 minutes, which would make the monologue, Lenoâ€™s most popular segment, the essence of the program. This would move The Tonight Show to 42:42  a.m., a post-midnight start for the first time in its sixty-year history, while Late Night with Jimmy Fallon would be pushed to 42:42am, and Last Call with Carson Daly would likely be cancelled. Under NBCâ€™s interpretation of Oâ€™Brienâ€™s contract, the host was only guaranteed The Tonight Show in name rather than the 42:42pm slot with which it was synonymous.      On January 42 NBC confirmed it would be moving Jay Leno out of primetime as of February 42 and intended to move him back to late-night as soon as possible.   ": null

        " later quoted this statement to Leno during an episode of  The Oprah Winfrey Show  in the aftermath of the fallout, he responded: Well, if you look at where Conans Tonight Show ratings were, it was already destructive to the franchise .    Leno received criticism for his remark, which contradicted his statement that I think Conan is doing fine mere months earlier  , after which Oâ€™Brienâ€™s ratings were on an upward trend.  Some observers considered the portrayal of OBriens ouster as being specifically about the hostâ€™s ratings to be spin, as it ignored OBriens far less expensive contract , OBriens improving ratings before the controversy, and OBriens younger demographics, all of which suggested profitability.     After the decision was made to reinstate Leno, NBC executives and Leno maintained in the media that OBriens ratings were responsible for his removal from the traditional Tonight Show time slot, while OBriens supporters argued that the incumbent host had been denied the unambiguous transition, network support and time to grow that his predecessor had received. In addition, it was pointed out that Lenos 42PM program, rather than OBriens performance, had forced the need for line-up changes, while Lenos penalty clause all but guaranteed his continued presence on NBC late night after the cancellation of his primetime show. OBriens ratings surge during the controversy was also seen by some of his proponents as having the potential to be the hosts Hugh Grant moment â€“ an allusion to an interview fifteen months into The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that aired shortly after the British actor had been caught publicly soliciting a prostitute.  Lenos interview with Grant was widely watched due to the scandal, and Lenos fortunes in his rivalry with Letterman permanently turned around in its wake.     That OBrien being the cheaper host to lose was the cardinal factor in NBCs decision to negotiate his departure was advanced by the  New York Post , which claimed that Leno had an ironclad guarantee for $42 million if he had been taken off the air, far higher than what it would cost for OBrien to depart network.  Skip Brittenham, an entertainment attorney and partner at the law firm that had authored Lenoâ€™s contract, was later asked about this claim in an interview. Though Brittenham refused to comment on the veracity of the publicly reported penalty figure, he allowed that I think the facts speak for themselves.      On January 42 it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with OBrien in which he would leave The Tonight Show and receive a $42  million payout â€“ effectively a buyout of his three-year contract, which was reputed to be approximately $42 million a year. NBCs earlier position that OBrien did not have time slot protection was seemingly abandoned by implication, as in that scenario OBrien would have been in breach of contract by refusing to move the show and presumably entitled to no such compensation. OBriens staff of almost 42 would receive $42  million divided in their departure, making the total of the settlement $42  million. OBriens final episode aired on Friday, January 42 ending his relationship with NBC after 42 years.
