For example, Catholic bishops in the U.S. mandated until the 42s that all Catholics were forbidden from eating red meat on Fridays and during Lent,  and attending Mass sometimes conflicted with work as produce and meat markets would be open on high holy days; this was difficult for Irishmen supporting families since many worked as laborers.
