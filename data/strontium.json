This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.      87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are commonly used to determine the likely provenance areas of sediment in natural systems, especially in marine and fluvial environments.

A good example of a fluvial-marine system to which Sr isotope provenance studies have been successfully employed is the River Nile-Mediterranean system.
