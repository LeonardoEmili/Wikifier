He spent several years aboard this ship, and found that he could spend much of his time reading and writing. It was aboard the Conway that Masefields love of story-telling grew. While he was on the ship he listened to the stories told about sea lore, continued to read, and decided that he was to become a writer and story-teller himself.          In 1894 Masefield boarded the Gilcruix, destined for Chile. This first voyage brought him the experience of sea sickness, but his record of his experiences while sailing through extreme weather shows his delight in seeing flying fish, porpoises and birds.

After King Cole, Masefield turned away from long poems and back to novels. Between 1924 and 1939 he published 12 novels, which vary from stories of the sea  to social novels about modern England , and from tales of an imaginary land in Central America  to fantasies for children . In this same period he wrote a large number of dramatic pieces. Most of these were based on Christian themes, and Masefield, to his amazement, encountered a ban on the performance of plays on biblical subjects that went back to the Reformation and had been revived a generation earlier to prevent production of Oscar Wildes Salome. However, a compromise was reached and in 1928 his The Coming of Christ was the first play to be performed in an English cathedral since the Middle Ages.
