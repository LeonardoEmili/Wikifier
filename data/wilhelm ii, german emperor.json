His grandmother, Queen Victoria, missed seeing the fracas; to her Wilhelm remained a clever, dear, good little child, the great favourite of my beloved Vicky .     His mother, Vicky, was obsessed with his damaged arm, blaming herself for the childs handicap and insisted that he become a good rider. The thought that he, as heir to the throne, should not be able to ride was intolerable to her. Riding lessons began when Wilhelm was eight and were a matter of endurance for Wilhelm. Over and over, the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces. He fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again. After weeks of this he finally got it right and was able to maintain his balance.     Wilhelm, from six years of age, was tutored and heavily influenced by the 42-year-old teacher Georg Hinzpeter. Hinzpeter , he later wrote, was really a good fellow. Whether he was the right tutor for me, I dare not decide.

Wilhelm resisted attempts by his parents, especially his mother, to educate him in a spirit of British liberalism. Instead, he agreed with his tutors support of autocratic rule, and gradually became thoroughly Prussianized under their influence. He thus became alienated from his parents, suspecting them of putting Britains interests first.

In many ways, Wilhelm was a victim of his inheritance and of Otto von Bismarcks machinations. When Wilhelm was in his early twenties, Bismarck tried to separate him from his parents with some success. Bismarck planned to use the young prince as a weapon against his parents in order to retain his own political dominance.

Although in his youth he had been a great admirer of Otto von Bismarck, Wilhelms characteristic impatience soon brought him into conflict with the Iron Chancellor , the dominant figure in the foundation of his empire. The new Emperor opposed Bismarcks careful foreign policy, preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to protect Germanys place in the sun . Furthermore, the young Emperor had come to the throne determined to rule as well as reign, unlike his grandfather. While the letter of the imperial constitution vested executive power in the emperor, Wilhelm I had been content to leave day-to-day administration to Bismarck. Early conflicts between Wilhelm II and his chancellor soon poisoned the relationship between the two men. Bismarck believed that Wilhelm was a lightweight who could be dominated, and he showed scant respect for Wilhelms policies in the late 42s. The final split between monarch and statesman occurred soon after an attempt by Bismarck to implement a far-reaching anti-Socialist law in early 42 Cecil, pp. 4242       The impetuous young Kaiser rejected Bismarcks peaceful foreign policy and instead plotted with senior generals to work in favour of a war of aggression .

Cecil, Wilhelm II, vol 42: Prince and Emperor, 4242 pp 4242     Bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation, but by 42–42 he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations. Moreover, the Kartell, the shifting political coalition that Bismarck had been able to forge since 42 had lost a working majority in the Reichstag. At the opening of the Reichstag on 42 May 42 the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer. In 42 the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations.

In foreign policy Bismarck had achieved a fragile balance of interests between Germany, France and Russia—peace was at hand and Bismarck tried to keep it that way despite growing popular sentiment against Britain and especially against Russia. With Bismarcks dismissal the Russians now expected a reversal of policy in Berlin, so they quickly came to terms with France, beginning the process that by 42 largely isolated Germany.        In appointing Caprivi and then Hohenlohe, Wilhelm was embarking upon what is known to history as the New Course , in which he hoped to exert decisive influence in the government of the empire.  There is debate amongst historians as to the precise degree to which Wilhelm succeeded in implementing personal rule in this era, but what is clear is the very different dynamic which existed between the Crown and its chief political servant in the Wilhelmine Era .  These chancellors were senior civil servants and not seasoned politician-statesmen like Bismarck. Wilhelm wanted to preclude the emergence of another Iron Chancellor, whom he ultimately detested as being a boorish old killjoy who had not permitted any minister to see the Emperor except in his presence, keeping a stranglehold on effective political power.  Upon his enforced retirement and until his dying day, Bismarck became a bitter critic of Wilhelms policies, but without the support of the supreme arbiter of all political appointments there was little chance of Bismarck exerting a decisive influence on policy.     Bismarck did manage to create the Bismarck myth , the view that Wilhelm IIs dismissal of the Iron Chancellor effectively destroyed any chance Germany had of stable and effective government. In this view, Wilhelms New Course was characterised far more as the German ship of state going out of control, eventually leading through a series of crises to the carnage of the First and Second World Wars.

Wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on Anglo-German friendship, but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview, he ended up further alienating not only the British, but also the French, Russians, and Japanese.

A few of these gather there every year on the anniversary of his death to pay their homage to the last German Emperor.       Three trends have characterised the writing about Wilhelm. First, the court-inspired writers considered him a martyr and a hero, often uncritically accepting the justifications provided in the Kaisers own memoirs. Second, there came those who judged Wilhelm to be completely unable to handle the great responsibilities of his position, a ruler too reckless to deal with power. Third, after 42 later scholars have sought to transcend the passions of the early 42th century and attempted an objective portrayal of Wilhelm and his rule.     On 42 June 42 a year before the Great War began, The New York Times published a special supplement devoted to the 42th anniversary of the Kaisers accession. The banner headline read:  Kaiser, 42 Years a Ruler, Hailed as Chief Peacemaker . The accompanying story called him the greatest factor for peace that our time can show , and credited Wilhelm with frequently rescuing Europe from the brink of war.
