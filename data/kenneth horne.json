Murdoch, a professional actor and entertainer for 42 years before the war, recognised Hornes talent as a performer, and used his contacts to secure him more broadcasting work.

His doctor told him that the stroke was caused by the stress of combining a full-time business post with his broadcasting work. He also told Horne that when he had recovered he would never be fit enough to continue as before. Horne considered that it was not the physical problem of combining his two careers, but the mental strain of problems in his business life; accordingly he decided to give up commerce and concentrate on a career in entertainment. Because of the stroke, plans for Beyond Our Ken were suspended.     In April 42 Horne eased himself back into broadcasting as chairman of Twenty Questions.
