        ", there were both vocal and instrumental estampies , which differed somewhat in form, in that the vocal estampie begins with a refrain, which is repeated at the end of each verse . Also according to Grocheio, the repeating sections in both the vocal and instrumental estampie were called puncta  , in the form:     :aa, bb, cc, etc..     The two statements of each punctus differ only in their endings, described as apertum and clausum by Grocheio, who believed that six puncta were standard for the stantipes , though he was aware of stantipes with seven puncta . The structure can therefore be diagrammed as:     :a+x, a+y; b+w, b+z; etc..     Sometimes the same two endings are used for all the puncta, producing the structure     :a+x, a+y; b+x, b+y, c+x, c+y, etc.  Punctus autem est ordinata aggregatio concordantiarum harmoniam facientium   ascendendo et descendendo duas habens partes in principio similes, in fine   differentes, qui clausum et apertum communiter appellantur.

The estampie is the first known genre of medieval era dance music which continues to exist today. The estampie can be monophonic or polyphonic . The melody is monophonic and is heard as the most prominent melody. However, the melody becomes polyphonic when accompanied by instrumentalists around the one written melody . The estampie was performed in a lively triple meter, a primary division of three beats to the bar. During polyphonic arrangements, the lines do not cross one another. The top line is in the soprano/alto range, using an instrument such as a recorder. The bottom line is in the tenor range using an instrument such as the crumhorn .

Grocheio explains the difference between a vocal and instrumental estampie is in the refrain . Refrains within the instrumental estampie are the notes that are automatically repeated with each puntum . In a vocal estampie, the words carry the refrain and do not repeat, therefore, the last punctum is sung twice . Grocheio has described the differing lengths of puncta as irregular and complicated. He further states that this difficulty captivates the attention of both the players and listeners and diverts the minds of the rich from wicked thoughts . These differences in puncta, i.e. different phrase lengths, lack percussive measure relating to the rhythmic sounds common to all the instruments. The length of percussive measure is equal in a ductia, however is unequal in length in the estampie .
