When abbreviating names, the surname is written fully , but only the first letter of each character in the given name is taken, with full stops after each initial: Lǐ Huá  → Lǐ H. or LǏ H., Zhūgě Kǒngmíng  → Zhūgě K.

Abbreviated compounds : gōnggòng guānxì  → gōng-guān , chángtú diànhuà  → cháng-huà . Exceptions are made when the abbreviated term has become established as a word in its own right, as in chūzhōng  for chūjí zhōngxué .
