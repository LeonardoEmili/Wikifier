Alfred Marshall and his disciples dominated economic theory until the end of WW 42 With the Cold War, the theory changed emphasizing that market economy was superior and the only sensible way. In Paul Samuelson´s “Economics: An Introductory Analysis ”, 42 Adam Smith´s “invisible hand” was only a footnote. In later editions, it became the central theme.     As Samuelson The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson, vol. iii, p. 42 MIT Press 42 remembers all this was challenged by Stanislaw Ulam: “ ars ago … I was in the Society of Fellows at Harvard along with the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. Ulam, who was to become an originator of the Monte Carlo method and co-discoverer of the hydrogen-bomb, … used to tease me by saying, ‘Name me one proposition in all of the social sciences which is both true and non-trivial.’ This was the test that I always failed. But now, some thirty years later … an appropriate answer occurs to me: The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage … . That it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that it is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them. Some of these thousands witnessed that by exchanging wine against cloth their formerly richer countries impoverished because workers can combine and exact higher wages rural laborers and maidservants cannot.       From the publication of his first paper as a student in 42 until his death, Ulam was constantly writing on mathematics. The list of Ulams publications includes more than 42 papers.
