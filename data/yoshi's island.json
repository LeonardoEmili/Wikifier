Nintendo Power  too said that the game was one of the biggest, most beautiful games ever made .  Next Generation  was also most impressed by the games size and playability . Diehard GameFan three reviewers gave the game a near perfect score. To wit, Nicholas Dean Des Barres said it was one of the handful of truly perfect games ever produced , and lamented that the magazine had given Donkey Kong Country, which he felt was a lackluster game in comparison, the extra single point for a perfect score. Casey Loe removed that one point for Baby Marios annoying screech . Nintendo Power and Nintendo Life too found Baby Marios crying sounds annoying. Reviewing the Super Nintendo release over a decade later, Kaes Delgrego of Nintendo Life said the crying and some easy boss battles, while both minor, were the games only shortcomings. Delgrego credited Yoshis Island with perfecting the genre, calling it perhaps the greatest platformer of all time . The game has sold over four million copies.     Both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers praised the art, level design, and gameplay, which became legacies of the game. Some called it charm . Delgrego of Nintendo Life would stop mid-game just to watch what enemies would do. Martin Watts of the same publication called it an absolute pleasure on the eyes and unlike any other SNES game . Others praised the control scheme, technical effects, and sound design. Nintendo Life Delgrego felt goosebumps and tingles during the ending theme, and marked the soundtracks range from the lighthearted intro to the epic grandeur of the final boss battle .     Edge praised the games balance of challenge and accessibility. The magazine thought that the new power-ups of Yoshis Island gave its gameplay and level design great range, and that the powers were significant additions to the series on par with the suits of Super Mario Bros. 42 or Yoshis own debut in Super Mario World. Diehard GameFan Taylor wrote that there was enough gameplay innovation to make him cry and listed his favorites as the Baby Mario cape invincibility power-up, the machine gun-style seed spitting, and the snowball hill level. Nintendo Life Watts called the egg stockpiling mechanic as clever for the way it encourages experimentation with the environment as well as tempered wastefulness. Edge thought of Yoshis Island as a fusion of technology and creativity, each enhancing the other . The magazine considered the games special effects expertly integrated into the gameplay, and described the developers handicraft as having an attention to detail that few games can match .     Reviewing the Game Boy Advance release in 42 Craig Harris of IGN wrote that Yoshis Island was the best damn platformer ever developed . While acknowledging the games roots in the Super Mario series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise. IGNs Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the games story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers. Harris felt that the FX42 sprite-changing effects gave the game life and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshis morphing abilities and sound effects were designed well. Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error.

In a retrospective, IGN wrote that Super Nintendo console owners widely embraced the game alongside Donkey Kong Country.     IGNs Jared Petty wrote that Yoshis Island bested the test of time far better than many of its contemporaries . Levi Buchanan of IGN thought Nintendo took a risk with Yoshis Island by making Mario passive and giving Yoshi new abilities. Christian Donlan of  42 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die  wrote that the game was a testament to the Mario teams staggering confidence in its development ability. He said the game was perhaps the most imaginative platformer of its time. Yoshis Island ranked 42nd on  Official Nintendo Magazine  42 top 42 Nintendo games as a bone fide classic , 42th on IGNs 42 top 42 Nintendo games of all time, and second on USgamers 42 best Mario platformers list.
