Further regulations, relating to ventilation, fencing of disused shafts, signalling standards, and proper gauges and valves for steam-boilers and related machinery were also set down.     A series of further Acts, in 1860 and 1872 extended the legal provisions and strengthened safety provisions. Steady development of the coal industry, increasing association among miners, and increased scientific knowledge paved the way for the Coal Mines Act of 1872, which extended the legislation to similar industries. The same Act included the first comprehensive code of regulation to govern legal safeguards for health, life and limb. The presence of a more certified and competent management and increased levels of inspection were also provided for.     By the end of the century, a comprehensive set of regulations was in place in England that affected all industries. A similar system was implemented in other industrializing countries in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

In Sweden, participation is regulated through the Law on board representation . The law covers all private companies with 25 or more employees. In these companies, workers have a right to appoint two board members and two substitutes. If the company has more than 1,000 employees, this rises to three members and three substitutes. It is common practice to allocate them among the major union coalitions.

        " were the first laws regulating labour relations in the United Kingdom. Most employment law before 1960 was based upon the Law of Contract. Since then there has been a significant expansion primarily due to the equality movement  and the European Union. Laws are either Acts of Parliament called Statutes, Statutory Regulations or Case Law .     The first significant expansion was the Equal Pay Act of 1970. This act was introduced to bring about pay equality for women in the workplace. Since 1997, changes in UK employment law include enhanced maternity and paternity rights,  the introduction of a National Minimum Wage  and the Working Time Regulations,  which covers working time, rest breaks and the right to paid annual leave. Discrimination law has been tightened, with protection from discrimination now available on the grounds of age, religion or belief and sexual orientation as well as gender, race and disability.

The beginnings of halakhic labour law are in the Bible, in which two commandments refer to this subject: The law against delayed wages and the workers right to eat the employers crops . The Talmudic law—in which labour law is called laws of worker hiring —elaborates on many more aspects of employment relations, mainly in Tractate Baba Metzia. In some issues the Talamud, following the Tosefta, refers the parties to the customary law: All is as the custom of the region .   Modern halakhic labour law developed very slowly. Rabbi Israel Meir Hacohen interprets the workers right for timely payment in a tendency that clearly favours the employee over the employer, but does not refer to new questions of employment relations. Only in the 1920s we find the first halakhic authority to tackle the questions of trade unions and the right of strike . Rabbis ": null
