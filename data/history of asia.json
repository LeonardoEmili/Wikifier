However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.     By the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing Chinas politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.            China saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners.
