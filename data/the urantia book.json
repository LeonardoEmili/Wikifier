Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.     In 42 a group of Sadlers friends, former patients, and colleagues began meeting for Sunday philosophical and religious discussions, but became interested in the strange communications when Sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request. Shortly afterwards, a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the contact personality.     Sadler presented this development to the group, and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness, but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers. They became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions, until all papers now collected together as The Urantia Book were obtained. The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized as a closed group of 42 members in 42 who pledged not to discuss the material with others. Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 42 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book.     The Sadlers and others involved, now all deceased, claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 42 until 42 in a way that was not understood even by them, with the first two parts being completed in 42 and the third and fourth in 42 The last Forum gathering was in 42     After the last of Part IV was obtained in 42 an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions. Sadler and his son William Sadler, Jr. at one point wrote a draft introduction and were told that they could not add their introduction. The Foreword was then received.

In 42 after having compiled an index of The Urantia Book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts, Kristen Maaherra was sued by the Urantia Foundation for violating their copyright on the book. In 42 Maaherra won a Summary Judgment declaring the Urantia Foundations copyright renewal invalid. Upon appeal, the judgment was reversed and awarded to the Urantia Foundation.     Four years later, in 42 Harry McMullan III and the Michael Foundation published a book, Jesusâ€“A New Revelation, which included verbatim 42 of the 42 papers included in The Urantia Book. McMullan and the Michael Foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the Urantia Foundations US copyright in The Urantia Book was either invalid or, alternatively, that the copyright had not been infringed upon. Urantia Foundations copyright was held to have expired in 42 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire. These two arguments having been rejected, a U.S. court held that, since the Conduit had died prior to 42 only the Conduits heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 42 and, since they had not done so, the Urantia Foundations copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain. This decision was upheld on appeal.

While stating that the concept of one God in three persons is difficult to fully understand, the book says that the idea: ...in no manner violates the truth of the divine unity. The three personalities of Paradise Deity are, in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations, as one.      The Father, Son, and Spirit are considered existential persons of Deity, those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future. In addition, three persons of Deity are described who are experiential, or incomplete and in the process of actualizing: God the Supreme; God the Ultimate; and God the Absolute. Of these three, God the Supreme, or the Supreme Being, is given the most explanation, as the person of Deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite. The persons of God the Ultimate and God the Absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis.

Lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a revelation, it could be claimed the celestial beings simply found areas of Adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them. While the book supports aspects of Adventism, it also is mixed with teachings that are heresies to Adventists.       The book can be seen as belonging in the genre of spiritual literature that includes  A Course in Miracles  and  Conversations with God . Gardner compares it with  Oahspe , noting that though Oahspe is vastly inferior to the UB both in ideas and style of writing, they are similar in claiming to have been written by celestial beings channelled through a human conduit, teaching that there is one ultimate God who oversees a vast bureaucracy of lesser deities while both outline an elaborate cosmology.

Gooch says that for nonbelievers, the book is a mixture of being fascinating, inspiring, compelling, haunting, entertaining, annoying, incomprehensible, and always wordy.      Parts I, II, and III are chiefly written in expository language. The papers are informational, matter-of-fact, and instructional. Part IV of the book is written as a biography of Jesus life, and some feel it is a rich narrative with well-developed characters, high attention to detail, woven sub-plots, and realistic dialogue.

His assessment is that the narrative is consistent with human authorship.

McMenamin also states, Of course I am being selective here in my choice of quotations, and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in The Urantia Book.       The Urantia Book states in its Foreword that more than one thousand human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings  were selected in preparing the papers. The authors say that they were required to give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented and would resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind. One of the authors wrote in Part IV: I well know that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds.      In recent years, students of the papers have found that the free use of other sources appears to be true. None of the material allegedly used from other sources is directly cited or referenced within the book.     In 42 a reader of The Urantia Book, Matthew Block, self-published a paper that showed The Urantia Book utilized material from 42 other books. All of the source authors identified in Blocks paper were published in English between 42 and 42 by U.S. publishers and are typically scholarly or academic works that contain concepts and wording similar to what is found in The Urantia Book. Block has since claimed to have discovered over 42 source texts that were incorporated into the papers.     The use of outside source materials was studied separately by Gardner, and Gooch, and they concluded, consistent with their respective conclusion that the books author must have been human, that the book therefore plagiarized many of the sources noted by Block.

Gooch, a professor of English, assessed that the use of the sources does reveal to us an author with a busy genius for metaphysical invention and poetic turns of phrase whose scam was at worst benign and at most visionary.  Asked by Gardner what he thought of these plagiarisms, Sprunger responded in a letter by saying that if humans wrote the book the plagiarisms would indeed be disturbing but not if it was written by supermortals.           It is difficult to gauge how many adherents there may be as there are multiple organizations to census. Informal study groups tend to sprout, ripen, then vanish or splinter and have not been counted reliably. Readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades, others join them soon after developing an interest in the book, while for most, worship remains as individual as the act of reading.  Disagreements over the legal ownership of the book, its interpretation, and the reception of new revelations have led to some splintering, though these disagreements appear to have been settled to the satisfaction of most adherents. The movement generally incorporates a nonsectarian view, contending that individuals with different religious backgrounds can receive the books teachings as an enrichment rather than as a contradiction of their faiths.     The movement inspired by The Urantia Book has not developed clergy or institutions such as churches, or temples.     Sarah Lewis notes that, The Urantia Revelation is not securing legitimacy through historically known and accepted means to any great degree, nor is it even using common language that would increase the likelihood of understanding and therefore acceptance. It introduces new concepts and a new language, and this does not make acceptance any easier. She assesses that the movement is uncontroversial compared to other ones, lacking the zealous proselytizing found within many other groups, and that it is therefore likely to remain small and unaffected by opposing views.     Urantia Foundation advocated a slow growth policy in the past and had not significantly marketed the book. Sales by Urantia Foundation went from 42 in 42 to 42 in 42 and steadily increased to nearly 42 in 42 an upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart,  however in 42 the Foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 42 copies and over 42 downloads from various sites.
