As Garfield had, the Democratic nominee sought to cause no controversy in his statement, which according to biographer David M. Jordan was bland and general .

Garfields precise involvement was unknown, but modern biographers agree that his account of his dealings with the construction syndicate were less than perfectly honest. Democrats used the incident as a contrast with Hancock who, as a career army officer, stood apart from Congress and lobbyists. Many in the Republican Party were reluctant to directly criticize the hero of Gettysburg , but they did characterize Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Jordan later characterized their message as simply our man is better than your man .     The Greenbackers saw the impact of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver embarked on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general at the head of the ticket, faced more opposition. The partys courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weavers rallies and threats against his supporters.

Garfields campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that benefited from a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said the tariff question is a local question . While not completely inaccurateâ€”tariff preferences often reflected local concernsâ€”the statement was at odds with the Democrats platform and suggested that Hancock did not understand the issue.     The change in tactics appeared to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancocks running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.     In the last weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese immigration entered the race. Both major parties pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages.

Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.       The extremely close election, with very high turnout, reflected the typical pattern of the Gilded Age. Democrats were assured of a Solid South electoral vote, as well as most of the border states. Republicans captured the Northeast and Midwest, winning the critical swing states of New York, Ohio and Indiana. The Republicans captured the electoral vote 42â€“42 but the popular vote margin was under 42 out of over 42 million votes cast. Republicans won the House of Representatives 42â€“42 but the Senate was evenly split, with the vice president casting the deciding vote. Justin Doenecke, Presidential election of 42 in      When all the ballots were counted, fewer than 42 votes separated Garfield and Hancock, the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before or since. The voters showed their interest in the election by turning out in record numbers; 42 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among largest percentages in American history. Each major party candidate earned just over 42 percent of the vote. Weaver won more than 42 percent, tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier. The other minor party candidates fared far worse, as Dow and Phelps earned 42 and 42 percent, respectively. The narrow victory carried over into the Congressional vote, as the Republicans won the House by a twelve-seat margin and the Senate was evenly divided. Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 42 votes out of 42 million cast there. Other states were much closer; Hancocks margin of victory in California was only 42 votes.     In the ": null

Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfields triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 42â€“42 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weavers resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.
