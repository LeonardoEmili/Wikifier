The notion of using Planckian radiators as a yardstick against which to judge other light sources is not new.  In 1923, writing about grading of illuminants with reference to quality of color ... the temperature of the source as an index of the quality of color , Priest essentially described CCT as we understand it today, going so far as to use the term apparent color temperature , and astutely recognized three cases:    Those for which the spectral distribution of energy is identical with that given by the Planckian formula.   Those for which the spectral distribution of energy is not identical with that given by the Planckian formula, but still is of such a form that the quality of the color evoked is the same as would be evoked by the energy from a Planckian radiator at the given color temperature.   Those for which the spectral distribution of energy is such that the color can be matched only approximately by a stimulus of the Planckian form of spectral distribution.

These developments paved the way for the development of new chromaticity spaces that are more suited to estimating correlated color temperatures and chromaticity differences. Bridging the concepts of color difference and color temperature, Priest made the observation that the eye is sensitive to constant differences in reciprocal temperature:           Priest proposed to use the scale of temperature as a scale for arranging the chromaticities of the several illuminants in a serial order . Over the next few years, Judd published three more significant papers:     The first verified the findings of Priest, Davis, and Judd, with a paper on sensitivity to change in color temperature.

The isotherms are perpendicular to the Planckian locus, and are drawn to indicate the maximum distance from the locus that the CIE considers the correlated color temperature to be meaningful: \\Delta uv\\pm 0.05     The distance from the locus is traditionally indicated in units of \\Delta uv ; positive for points above the locus. This concept of distance has evolved to become Delta E , which continues to be used today.       Before the advent of powerful personal computer s, it was common to estimate the correlated color temperature by way of interpolation from look-up tables and charts. The most famous such method is Robertsons, who took advantage of the relatively even spacing of the mired scale to calculate the CCT T c using linear interpolation of the isotherms mired values: , Bruce Lindbloom     300     : \\frac\\frac+\\frac \\left,     where T_i and T_ are the color temperatures of the look-up isotherms and i is chosen such that T_i ": null
