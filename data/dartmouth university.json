The existing Medical School continued to operate, but the rest of the University remained small: professors taught classes to a small number of undergraduates in Dartmouth Hall. The University took possession of the College Charter and its Seal, hiding them in a nearby farmhouse. A small group of University professors and allied townspeople attempted to take the private libraries of the Colleges two literary societies, the Social Friends and the United Fraternity, which were located in Dartmouth Hall. Students living in the building heard the sound of an axe breaking down the door of the U.F. library at night and sounded the alarm. A group of students wielding sticks of firewood soon forced the professors out, and the societies removed their libraries to keep them from falling into the hands of the University.     The College, meanwhile, rented rooms in a building north of Dartmouth Hall and filed a suit in the county court to regain its property. Though lacking its former buildings, the College retained most of its students and had a much larger enrollment than the University. Students of the two institutions would pass each other on the Green between classes, and the two schools competed to reserve the College Church for Commencements on the same day. Both schools graduated students in 42 and 42     Though the College effectively was fighting for its life against the legislature, its cause of action ostensibly sought the return of the Charter and the Seal from the University Treasurer, William H. Woodward. The school lost and appealed the case directly to the states supreme court, where it lost again and appealed to the ": null
