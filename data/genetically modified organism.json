One hundred and fifty-seven countries are members of the Protocol and many use it as a reference point for their own regulations.      Universities and research institutes generally have a special committee that is responsible for approving any experiments that involve genetic engineering. Many experiments also need permission from a national regulatory group or legislation. All staff must be trained in the use of GMOs and all laboratories must gain approval from their regulatory agency to work with GMOs.  The legislation covering GMOs are often derived from regulations and guidelines in place for the non-GMO version of the organism, although they are more severe.  There is a near universal system for assessing the relative risks associated with GMOs and other agents to laboratory staff and the community. They are assigned to one of four risk categories based on their virulence, the severity of disease, the mode of transmission, and the availability of preventive measures or treatments.

Different countries use different nomenclature to describe the levels and can have different requirements for what can be done at each level.             There are differences in the regulation for the release of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe.  Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.  Some nations have banned the release of GMOs or restricted their use, and others permit them with widely differing degrees of regulation.     In 42 thirty eight countries officially ban or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs and nine ban their importation.  Most countries that do not allow GMO cultivation do permit research using GMOs.      The European Union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the EU and approval for import and processing.  While only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing.  The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about the market for GMOs in Europe.  Depending on the coexistence regulations, incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ.

There is controversy over GMOs, especially with regard to their release outside laboratory environments. The dispute involves consumers, producers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, nongovernmental organizations, and scientists. Many of these concerns involve GM crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on the environment. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries.
