Two months after his fathers death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. Uncle Peter Gansevoort, a director of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year . Parker , 68 Biographers cite a passage from  Redburn  when trying to answer what Herman must have felt then: I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time, the narrator remarks, adding, I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt  ... and we removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me . Arvin argues Melville was forced to reckon with the tormented psychology, of the decayed patrician .     When Melvilles paternal grandfather died on September 16, 1832, Maria and her children discovered Allan, somewhat unscrupulously, had borrowed more than his share of his inheritance, meaning Maria received only $20 .

Parker , 674–675 Around May 1834, the Melvilles moved to another house in Albany, a three-story brick house. That same month a fire destroyed Gansevoorts skin-preparing factory, which left him with personnel he could neither employ nor afford. Instead he pulled Melville out of the bank to man the cap and fur store.     In 1835, while still working in the store, Melville enrolled in Albany Classical School, perhaps using Marias part of the proceeds from the sale of the estate of his maternal grandmother in March 1835. Parker , 98 In September of the following year Herman was back in Albany Academy in the Latin course. He also participated in debating societies, in an apparent effort to make up as much as he could for his missed years of schooling. In this period he read Shakespeare—at least  Macbeth , whose witch scenes gave him the chance to teasingly scare his sisters. Parker , 107 In March 1837, he was again withdrawn from Albany Academy.     Gansevoort served as a role model and support for Melville in many ways throughout his life, at this time particularly in forming a self-directed educational plan. In early 1834 Gansevoort had become a member of Albanys Young Mens Association for Mutual Improvement, and in January 1835 Melville joined him there. Parker , 97 Gansevoort also had copies of John Todds Index Rerum, a blank register for indexing remarkable passages from books one had read for easy retrieval. Among the sample entries which Gansevoort made showing his academic scrupulousness was Pequot, beautiful description of the war with, with a short title reference to the place in Benjamin Trumbulls A Complete History of Connecticut where the description could be found. The two surviving volumes of Gansevoorts are the best evidence for Melvilles reading in this period. Gansevoorts entries include books Melville used for Moby-Dick and Clarel, such as Parsees—of India—an excellent description of their character, and religion and an account of their descent—East India Sketch Book p. 21 .

In the Albany Microscope in March, Melville published two polemical letters about issues in vogue in the debating societies.
