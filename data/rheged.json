The discovery was announced to the public in January 2017 and the site is still under excavation.     One of the lead researchers, Ronan Toolis, stated that their findings revealed structural ruins atop the hill. These originally belonged to a fortification system with a timber-reinforced stone rampart where the main fortification was supplemented by smaller defensive works along the low-lying slopes. According to Toolis, this suggests the presence of a royal stronghold of the period: This is a type of fort that has been recognized in Scotland as a form of high status secular settlement of the early medieval period. The evidence makes a compelling case for Galloway being the core of the kingdom of Rheged.

It has been suggested that the second element could be Gaelic reichet rather than Old Welsh Reget, and that the place was so named by the Gall Gaidhil, foreign Gaels, who colonised Galloway in the Viking period.
