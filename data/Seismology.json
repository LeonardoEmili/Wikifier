Surface waves travel more slowly than P-waves and S-waves because they are the result of these waves traveling along indirect paths to interact with Earths surface. Because they travel along the surface of the Earth, their energy decays less rapidly than body waves , and thus the shaking caused by surface waves is generally stronger than that of body waves.
