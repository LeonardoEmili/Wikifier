In primary sources, Hormizd is credited as the founder of the city of Ohrmazd-Ardashir , however, in some instances Ardashir I is also attributed as its founder. Modern historians consider Hormizd to be its actual founder. Hormizd was not succeeded by his son Hormozdak, but by his brother Bahram , who ascended the throne with the aid of Kartir.          While Ardashir I and Shapur I generally used the title of King of Kings of ians on their coinage, Hormizd had the title slighty modified, adding the phrase and non-Iran . His full title thus read the Mazda-worshiping, divine Hormizd, King of Kings of Iran and non-Iran, whose image/brilliance is from the gods . The phrase and non-Iran had already been in use in the inscriptions of Shapur I, and in rare cases his coin mints, but was first regularized under Hormizd. The extended title demonstrates the incorporation of new territory into the empire, however what was precisely seen as non-Iran  is not certain.
