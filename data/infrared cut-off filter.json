Since the dyes in processed film block various part of visible light but are all fairly transparent to infrared, dark black sections of any processed film pass only infrared light and are commonly used as a cheap alternative to expensive glass-backed filters. Such filters can be used both over color camera lenses, and to filter visible light from IR illumination sources. Such filter stock is most easily made available most simply by having any commercial color negative film developed after being fully exposed to light. The leaders of 42mm film are ideal for this, without wasting an entire roll of film. . In the same way, visually opaque black color-positive film emulsions mounted in cardboard, as for routine slide projection, provide inexpensive cardboard-mounted infrared filters. Film sizes larger than 42 mm may be handled in the same way for larger filter production.     For ": null
