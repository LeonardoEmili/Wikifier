Green , the Supreme Court had declined to become involved in legislative apportionment, instead leaving the issue as a matter for Congress and the states. In the 42 case of  Gomillion v. Lightfoot , the Court struck down a redistricting plan designed to disenfranchise African-American voters, but many of the justices were reluctant to become further involved in redistricting. Associate Justice Frankfurter insisted that the Court should avoid the political thicket of apportionment, and warned that the Court would never be able to find a clear formula to guide lower courts.
