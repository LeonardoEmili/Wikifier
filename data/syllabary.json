True syllabograms are those that encompass all parts of a syllable, i.e. initial onset, medial nucleus and final coda, but since onset and coda are optional in at least some languages, there are middle , start , end and full true syllabograms. Most syllabaries only feature one or two kinds of syllabograms and form other syllables by graphemic rules.     Syllabograms, hence syllabaries, are pure, analytic or arbitrary if they do not share graphic similarities that correspond to phonic similarities, e.g. the symbol for ka does not resemble in any predictable way the symbol for ki, nor the symbol for a.   Otherwise they are synthetic, if they vary by onset, rime, nucleus or coda, or systematic, if they vary by all of them.   Some scholars, e.g. Daniels, Peter Daniels, 1996. The Study of Writing Systems , p. 4. In: Daniels & Bright, The Worlds Writing Systems. reserve the general term for analytic syllabaries and invent other terms  as necessary.

Few syllabaries have glyphs for syllables that are not monomoraic, and those that once did have simplified over time to eliminate that complexity.   For example, the Vai syllabary originally had separate glyphs for syllables ending in a coda , a long vowel , or a diphthong , though not enough glyphs to distinguish all CV combinations . The modern script has been expanded to cover all moras, but at the same time reduced to exclude all other syllables. Bimoraic syllables are now written with two letters, as in Japanese: diphthongs are written with the help of V or hV glyphs, and the nasal coda is written with the glyph for ŋ, which can form a syllable of its own in Vai.

Thus one would need separate symbols for bag , beg , big , bog , bug , bad , bed , bid , bod , bud , bead , bide , bode , etc. Since English has well over 10,000 different possibilities for individual syllables,  a syllabary would be poorly suited to represent the English language.
