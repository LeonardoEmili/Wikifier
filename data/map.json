The maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called climatic maps.

Climatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes of the main isobaric surfaces counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.     Isolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values to connect points with equal values of the feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes . Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies . Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon . Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year . Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps ; the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.     Maps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earths surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.     Climatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.
