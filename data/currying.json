Currying translates this into a function h which takes a single real argument and outputs functions from \\mathbb to \\mathbb . In symbols, h:\\mathbb\\to\\mathbb^\\mathbb , where \\mathbb^\\mathbb denotes the set of all functions that take a single real argument and produce real outputs. For every real number x , define the function h_x : \\mathbb\\to\\mathbb by h_xx+y^2 , and then define the function h:\\mathbb\\to\\mathbb^\\mathbb by hh_x . So for instance, h is the function that sends its real argument y to the output 2+y^2 , or hh_22+y^2 .
