In 42 there are prehistoric remains found in the center, when it was being renovated.          Kinroois main economic activities are agriculture, tourism and the reclamation of gravel, sand and loam.   The downside of this reclamation is that a lot of land surface gets lost. Tourism is also an important resource. Kinrooi attracts a lot of tourists because it has seven nature reserves that harbor rare animal and plant species, it has a marina and because it has several old windmills. Besides, there is a lot of watersporting, in the old gravel pools. One of them, lying in Ophoven, is now the greatest inner harbour of Europe.    ": null
