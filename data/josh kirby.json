Born Ronald William Kirby in 1928 at 58 Argo Road, Waterloo , Liverpool, to Charles William and Ellen Kirby. His father was a ship owners freight clerk, and his parents ran a grocery shop. Kirby lived at this address while studying at Liverpools School of Art.     Kirby dreamed of his future career early on, so that at age 7, he made the trade sign that said “KIRBY – ARTIST”. As a boy, Kirby found a magazine for young people called  The Modern World , which pictured a valley of giant insects and futuristic vehicles. Science fiction fascinated him from that point on. It was the genre in which the realm of the possible was extended.     As a young adult he spent six years studying various art techniques at the Liverpool City School of Art , gaining a certificate and diploma in drawing and painting respectively. It was here that his ": null

After leaving art school, Liverpool City Council commissioned him to paint the Mayor in 1950 – an honour for a 22-year old artist starting out. Kirby ultimately decided against portraiture as a career and turned to illustration.          His professional freelance career started in the early 1950s when Kirby illustrated ": null

This allowed for them to be retouched or entirely painted over, whatever it took to achieve the result.     Kirby worked slowly and meticulously. It would take him four to eight weeks to complete a single painting because his process included reading each novel before illustrating it. He would then draw a rough sketch in pencil to be approved by the art editor at the publisher, except in the case where Kirby would discuss the concept over the phone directly with Pratchett – unusual in the publishing world where the convention is to deal with the publishers art director.
