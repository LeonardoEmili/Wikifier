        ". Initially, the strip was almost completely composed of actual vintage clip art and magazine cutouts, assembled collage-style and often manipulated and retouched. However, Tomorrow has gradually replaced cutouts with his own drawings, which merely mimic the clip art look. Usually drawn in four panels, it is not uncommon for all panels to be identical or nearly so, with only the dialogue and/or facial expressions changing.     The 42s theme extends to the typically verbose dialogue of his human characters which is often bubbly, over-enthusiastic, and na√Øve. The stupidity of the humans is countered by Sparky, a fast-talking penguin  with a red visor, who provides much of the strips political commentary.     A recurring theme in the comic books was that of reality engineering , wherein the very fabric of space and time is mined for the good of mankind . This periodically generates reality discontinuities , where reality breaks down. These are resolved by reality engineers.
