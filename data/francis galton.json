In 42 Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galtons lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.     In 42 Galton wrote a controversial letter to  The Times  titled Africa for the Chinese, where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilisation and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the supposedly inferior aboriginal blacks.

This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.

In Hereditary Genius, he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilisation as follows:          Galton invented the term  eugenics  in 42 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book,  Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development . He believed that a scheme of marks for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged by provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were  dysgenic . He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 42 October 42 Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.

Galtons formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galtons first attempt to study Darwinian questions, Hereditary Genius, generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 42s concerning the inheritance of physical traits. This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. they will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring.      This notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring, leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.     Galtons solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 42 meeting of the ": null

    {
        ", as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.  The address was published in  Nature , and Galton further developed the theory in Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature and Hereditary Stature.  An elaboration of this theory was published in 42 in Natural Inheritance. There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the development of the law of error in 42 & ndash;42 the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 42 and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 42     Galtons development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the ": null

Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes and then the pins , the result was a stable population. On Friday 42 February 42 Galton gave a lecture entitled Typical Laws of Heredity at the ": null

However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.     In 42 Galton started growing sweet peas and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 42 February 42 He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centered about the parents weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, Galton demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When Galton addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 42 he said of his investigation of sweet peas, I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon.     Galton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation. Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability.     The model for population stability resulted in Galtons formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity. This law, which was published in Natural Inheritance, states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offsprings heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a smaller proportion of the offsprings heritage. Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps. When ": null

In 42 London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.  The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order.     First, they would fill out a form with personal and family history , then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects heights in various positions as well as arm span and weight would be measured.     One excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets. The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.     Although the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through fenced off gallery measuring 42 feet long by 42 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.     Galton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a childs eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc. The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 42 respondents, each measured in 42 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.     After the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data. In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when the variation of the one is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.

An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animals weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 42 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that the middlemost estimate expresses the vox populi, every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters , and reported this value  as 42 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 42% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported  , Nature, 42 March 42 the mean of the guesses as 42 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy. Recent archival research has found some slips in transmitting Galtons calculations to the original article in Nature: the median was actually 42 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 42 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error. James Surowiecki uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.
