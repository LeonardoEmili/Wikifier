Harper, seeing Deckers antique uniform, queries Decker if there is a vintage air show nearby, or if he is making a film - Decker has no idea of what he is asked. He then asks Harper: Excuse me Sir, but where exactly am I? Harper sarcasticly responds Where exactly did you think you were? to which Decker says Well, I thought I was landing at 42th Squadron RFC. 42th Squadron RFC? Wasnt that... Wilson replies. Further confounded, Wilson asks Decker Whats todays date? , to which Decker answers March the 42th . What year? Why, 42 of course. 42?! , Harper incredulously says. Yes, thats correct...well, isnt it? Its March the fifth, 42 Lieutenant . Decker is almost speechless. Naturally, neither Harper nor Wilson believe Decker is truly from 42     Decker tells the officers he and his flying partner Alexander Mackaye were fighting seven German aircraft; Mackaye was shot down and Decker escaped into a cloud.

The American officers add that Air Vice Marshal Mackaye, in addition to being alive and well, is coming to the base that very day for an inspection. Decker says that is impossible, as Mackaye is dead. Harper, at this time, confiscates Deckers pistol and personal effects. Later, Wilson and Decker are alone in a small room, Major Wilson tries to help Decker remember what happened. Decker finally confesses that he has consistently avoided combat throughout his service, and that he deliberately abandoned the greatly outnumbered Mackaye when the two were attacked by the German fighters. Im a coward! Decker blurts. He refuses to believe that Mackaye somehow survived against such odds.     When Wilson suggests that someone else helped Mackaye, Decker realizes that he has been given a second chance. He tells the American officer that there was no one within fifty miles who could have come to Mackayes aid, so if Mackaye survived, it had to be because Decker went back himself. Knowing he cannot have much time to go back to 42 Decker pleads with Wilson to release him from custody. When Wilson refuses, Decker assaults him and a guard and hurriedly escapes . Running outside, he locates his plane, punches a mechanic who tries to get in his way, and starts the planes engine. He is about to take off when Wilson catches up and puts a pistol to his head. Decker tells Wilson he will have to shoot him to stop him, as he would rather die than remain a coward. After hesitating, Wilson allows him to escape and Decker flies his plane into white clouds and vanishes.     Major Wilson is rebuked by Major General Harper for believing such a fantastic story and for allowing that madman to escape. When Mackaye arrives and takes a seat, Wilson asks him Sir, did you ever know a man named William Terrence Decker? Mackaye is surprised: Terry Decker?! Oh I should know him - he saved my life . Mackaye proceeds to recount how he and Decker were attacked by seven German aircraft while out on patrol. Decker, in his fit of cowardice, flew away, disappearing in a cloud, with Mackaye thinking at first that Decker had abandoned him. Suddenly, from out of nowhere it seemed , Decker came diving out of the cloud with his aircraft guns blazing, and proceeded to shoot down three of the German planes before being shot down himself. With Deckers unbelievable story now corroborated by Mackaye, Wilson comes to believe what Decker had told him. Then he did get back, he says to himself. Mackaye does not understand why Wilson said this. General Harper, now also beginning to believe Decker, asks Mackaye if the Germans returned Deckers personal items, to which Mackaye responds no. Baffled, Harper then shows Mackaye the confiscated identification photo card and other personal effects of his young friend Decker who sacrificed his life for Mackaye, startling him. When Mackaye reverently asks, Where in Heavens name did you get these? , Harper responds, Theyre his? Yes, Mackaye softly says, then sternly demands, Now what the devil is this all about?! Major Wilson then suggests Maybe youd better sit down, Old Leadbottom , shocking Mackaye further with that nickname known only to him and Decker, from over 42 years earlier.
