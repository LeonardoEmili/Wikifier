At this time Newport News was tackling the mighty job of acting as design agent, responsible for the creation of detailed working drawings, for the Navys new s. This made Schade the Carrier Desks direct liaison at Newport News solely to effect work on the Essex design.     During 42 the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers again published one of Schades studies. His new study was entitled: Design Curves for Cross-Stiffened Plating Under Uniform Bending Load. This paper proved to be an important work, as the theories espoused therein by Schade were thereafter accepted and adopted by BuShips as new policy and practice regarding estimating static responses on welded stiffened ship panels.     Just four days before the Japanese aerial attack on Pearl Harbor, Commander Schade celebrated his 42nd birthday. By all accounts he had done a tremendous job over the previous two years at Newport News working diligently on the Essex project. His efforts had not gone unnoticed in the Bureau of Ships. With the nation now at war, his reward would not be long in coming.       Pearl Harbor had a dramatic impact on the leadership of BuShips. The Bureaus Chief, RAdm. ": null

        ", and Deputy Chief, RAdm. Alexander H. Van Keuren, immediately recognized that this new war would be conducted just as the Japanese conducted the raid on Pearl Harbor. This would be a carrier war. To successfully prosecute this war, the United States Navy would need both better carriers and more of them to defeat their enemies. To get these ships built both quickly and properly would take skill, ability, and leadership. To get that leadership they would need to fill each key position within the Bureau with the officer best suited to handle the colossal challenges that lie before them.     The Chief and Deputy Chief of BuShips wasted no time reorganizing their personnel to meet the demands of a two-ocean war. In the weeks following the attack on Pearl Harbor orders were sent to ships and stations around the world recalling the people they felt best suited for a particular task. One such recall was Commander Schade. Ordered detached from his role as SNLO at Newport News in late December 42 he was to report to Main Navy for duty at the Bureau of Ships by January 42 42     Just three weeks after turning 42 Schade had been identified as the ideal candidate to head the Bureaus Carrier Desk during the countrys first ever carrier war. Quite a responsibility for a Commander. Nearly all of the Bureaus ship type desks were run by officers with the rank of Captain. The fact that the most important ship type, arguably the aircraft carrier, for the anticipated nature of fighting would be placed in the hands of a mere Commander speaks volumes as to the complete faith both Robinson and Van Keuren had in Schade. There were thousands within the bureau that in some way would contribute to developing the Navys carriers, but it was up to Schade to get those carriers built and fully prepared to join the fleet.

His particular expertise in the strength of welded ship structures made him uniquely qualified to oversee the rapid construction of the US Navys aircraft carrier building program during the worlds first ever carrier war.     Modern day researchers of World War II era aircraft carriers, both student and professional, can visit the records of BuShips held at the National Archives and Records Administration, in College Park, Maryland. There they will find, indelibly marked for posterity, Schades impact on the US Navy carrier program. The serial number of nearly every carrier document carries the mark of - Schades Carrier Desk; and nearly all of those bear his classic handwritten big, bold, openly scripted partial signature Sch .     Schade indeed left his mark upon BuShips during World War II, but he also continues to impact lives today. Professional papers of modern-day Naval Architects frequently draw upon his concepts, passages, and papers as references for their own academic studies. Students are still today exploring Schades original theoretical thinking on effective breadth of ship structures and often cite his works in their doctoral dissertations.     Commodore Henry Adrian Packy Schade may be the least known man of World War II. But, he may also be as equally responsible for victory in the Pacific as any pilot that ever took off from, or landed on, one of his carriers.
