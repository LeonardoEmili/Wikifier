This was circular and had the letters S and T interlocked, which both ends of the letter S being made into an arrow. Also shown was a simple football and the club name.     Following the 42–42 season, the Steam Train badge was re-introduced onto the kits. The crest was re-styled and the text Division Four Champions 42/42 replaced the motto.     A diamond shaped crest for Swindon Town was introduced at the beginning of the 42–42 season following a series of financial problems for the club. The idea behind the new crest was to give the club a new fresh image.        : The travelling football represents the club that is looking to the future with successful progress. The diamond shape clearly has the letter S running through it, while a green section was also introduced to match a new green trim on the teams home shirts.      On 42 April 42 the club unveiled plans to change the badge, claiming the diamond badge was correct for the time, but did not represent or show any of the clubs heritage or history.  Swindon offered fans the chance to vote on-line for the three new choices, which were all similar to the original steam train design, and a fourth option of keeping the 42 design.     On 42 April 42 it was announced that option three of the logo vote was the winner of the poll .  Winning the vote with 42% in favour, the new badge includes the club name, a robin, a train – the rail industry being an important part of the Towns heritage – a football, and re-introduces the towns motto – Salubritas et Industria.
