The band released their second EP,  Remix & Repent , on November 25, 1997. It featured new versions of Antichrist Superstars four singles: The Beautiful People , Tourniquet , Antichrist Superstar and Man That You Fear . In February 1998, Manson released his autobiography, The Long Hard Road Out of Hell , as well as a live video entitled Dead to the World . It was also confirmed that Antichrist Superstar would be the first installment in a concept album trilogy which the band called their triptych .       thu   The band released the second part of their triptych, Mechanical Animals , on September 15, 1998. Co-produced by the bands lead singer with Sean Beavan and Michael Beinhorn , the album moved away from the industrial rock production of its predecessor and was strongly influenced by 1970s glam rock , particularly David Bowie s 1974 album Diamond Dogs . Billy Corgan served as an unofficial consultant to the band during the early development of the album. After playing a few songs for him, Corgan advised them that This is definitely the right direction but to go all the way with it. Dont just hint at it , referring to its inclusion of glam influences. To suit their new musical style, the band also recast itself as a glam rock outfit, setting aside the rotting-corpse chic of the previous era in favor of attire more suited to the genre, incorporating leather, platform boots and brightly dyed hair. The band also relocated from New Orleans to Los Angeles , while Zim Zum was replaced by guitarist John Lowery of 2wo . who dubbed himself John 5 .     Interscopes promotion of the album was massive, with the label erecting enormous billboards of the lead singer as an androgynous extraterrestrial in both Times Square and Sunset Strip . Repeated appearances on MTV and other networks helped propel the albums lead single, The Dope Show , to number twelve on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart, becoming the bands highest-charting single yet. The songs music video was critically acclaimed, winning two awards at the 1998 Billboard Music Video Awards as well as the Best Cinematography award at the 1999 MTV VMAs ; while the song was also nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards . The album would go on to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, with first week sales of over 223,000.     After a brief promotional campaign, the band set out on the Beautiful Monsters Tour with Hole . The tour would be a problematic one, and was marred by frequent on–and–off stage exchanges between Manson and Hole vocalist Courtney Love . Private disputes also arose over the tours financial arrangements, with Hole unwittingly financing most of Mansons production costs, which were disproportionately high relative to Holes. The tour was to include thirty-seven shows spanning over a two-month period, although Hole left after taking part in just nine of the scheduled dates. A broken ankle from Manson also forced the postponement of the next two shows, with the remainder of the tour being renamed Rock Is Dead and Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy taking over select opening slots.     The final four dates of the tour were canceled out of respect for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre . The latter half of 1999 and much of 2000 was a period of relative silence for the band, who refused to take part in interviews and retreated from public life. They shelved plans for a proposed single and music video for their cover of AC/DC s Highway to Hell , which appeared on the soundtrack to Detroit Rock City . They spent this period writing and recording in a secluded studio in Death Valley , with only the live album The Last Tour on Earth appearing during this time. A studio outtake from Antichrist Superstar, titled Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes , served as its only single.         Holy Wood was released on November 14, 2000. Produced by the bands lead singer with Dave Sardy , the album also features programming and pre-production editing by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb . The band wrote over 100 songs for the album, which was a return to the darker, more abrasive sound of Antichrist Superstar. Much of its content was written in response to the Columbine massacre, with the albums third single, The Nobodies , directly referring to the shootings. Described by the bands frontman as the third part of a trilogy which began with Antichrist Superstar and continued in Mechanical Animals, its overarching theme is an exploration of the relationship between death and fame in American culture, and its lyrics and artwork contain many references to John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald , John Lennon and Mark David Chapman , and Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth . The Guns, God and Government Tour elaborated on Holy Woods central theme, and with its logo – a rifle and handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross – Manson made no attempt to conceal what he saw as the source of that fascination.     The band also revealed that within their concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked together to create a larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this much in the way of an interpretation: wanting to fit into a world that didnt want me, and fighting really hard to get there. are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where youre given a choice to decide if youre going to be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over. It just becomes a cycle.     The band initially declined to join the 2001 line-up of Ozzy Osbourne s Ozzfest , as its June 21 date in Denver would mark their first appearance in Colorado since the Columbine massacre. After the band announced on their website that they would perform in Denver, they were protested by religious groups. The band planned to balance out their violent lyrics by quoting biblical texts, so we can examine the virtues of wonderful Christian stories of disease, murder, adultery, suicide and child sacrifice. The tour was documented by a DVD of the same name , which was released on October 29, 2002. In addition to a compilation style concert it includes a thirty-minute short film titled The Death Parade . This was followed by Guns, God and Government – Live in LA in 2009, which depicts their performance of January 13, 2001 at Los Angeless Grand Olympic Auditorium in its entirety.     Earlier in 2001, the band released a cover of Gloria Jones s Tainted Love on the soundtrack to Not Another Teen Movie . The song became the bands biggest international hit yet, peaking at number one in numerous European territories. In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson to record vocals on a track titled Redeemer , which was released on his soundtrack to Queen of the Damned . Manson also appeared in Michael Moore s 2002 documentary, Bowling for Columbine ; his appearance was filmed on the same day as their Denver Ozzfest performance. When Moore asked what Manson would have said to the students at Columbine, he replied, I wouldnt say a single word to them. I would listen to what they have to say, and thats what no one did.       With the triptych of previous albums complete, the band was free to begin a fresh project. In 2002, Manson created an original score for the Resident Evil film with former KMFDM multi-instrumentalist Tim Sköld . Soon after, Sköld became an official band member when Twiggy Ramirez amicably left the group, citing creative differences. After finding inspiration through Mansons girlfriend Dita Von Teese in the swing and burlesque movements of 1920s Berlin , the band recorded The Golden Age of Grotesque , which was released on May 13, 2003 and debuted atop the Billboard 200 album chart, selling over 118,000 copies on its first week. It was also an international success, particularly in Europe, where it sold over 400,000 copies on its first week, and topping various national record charts, as well as Billboards European Albums Chart . The album also appeared on several critics year-end lists, and won a 2003 Metal Edge Readers Choice Award for Album of the Year .   thu     Eschewing the lyrical depth and symbolism found on Holy Wood, the album was relatively straightforward: in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized work to the Entartete Kunst banned by the Nazi regime. Lyrically, Manson utilizes the narrative mode of stream of consciousness throughout the album to examine the human psyche in times of crisis, specifically focusing on the mindset of lunatic s and children, as, according to Manson, they dont follow the rules Several songs incorporate elements commonly found in playground chants and nursery rhyme s, which Manson would pervert into something ugly and lurid. The work of Kurt Weill was also noted as an influence, along with the lucid dream s the singer was having during its production, with Manson explaining that he would wake up and say, I want to write a song that sounds like a stampeding elephant, or I want to write a song that sounds like a burning piano.     Manson began his long-term collaboration with Austrian-Irish artist Gottfried Helnwein , working together on several multi-media projects associated with the album, including the exhibitions and installation art projects featured at the albums launch party at The Key Club in Los Angeles, the album artwork, the music video to lead single mOBSCENE , as well as the artwork which accompanied Mansons essay for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum . Limited edition copies of the album included a DVD titled Doppelherz , a 25-minute surrealist short film directed by Manson which featured art direction by Helnwein. Another world tour followed, Grotesk Burlesk , which furthered the albums Weimar Republic -inspired theme by adding Helnwein-created stage dressing and elements of German Kabarett to the groups performances. Manson and the band members began appearing both on-and off-stage in designer suits created by Jean-Paul Gaultier .     Lest We Forget: The Best Of was released on September 28, 2004 and was referred to by Manson as a farewell compilation. It was the last album released under Nothing Records, as the label was dissolved following a lawsuit filed by Reznor against his former manager and business partner, John Malm . The compilation was supported by the Against All Gods Tour , as well as a single–a cover of Depeche Mode s Personal Jesus . It was the first and only tour to feature Mark Chaussee of Rob Halfords Fight on lead guitar, replacing John 5, whose relationship with Manson had soured over the previous year. Former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna also replaced Ginger Fish, who fractured his wrist, skull and cheekbone after falling several feet off his drum riser during a performance at a German awards ceremony.       thu   By late 2005, the band had composed 18 new songs, but work on their sixth studio album was halted when Manson focused his attention on various film and art projects, including the development of his screenplay, Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll , as well as a minor role in the Lucy Liu movie Rise: Blood Hunter . He also launched a self-proclaimed art movement, the Celebritarian Corporation, which included artist Gottfried Helnwein, fashion designer Steven Klein and director Anthony Silva, as well as announcing plans to open an art gallery and publish a book of his paintings. It was after opening the Celebritarian Corporation Gallery Of Fine Art on Melrose Avenue in 2006 that work started on new material, with Manson writing lyrics over Skölds already existing compositions.     The resulting material was composed and recorded entirely by Sköld, and does not feature writing or performance contributions from any other member of the band. Its content is largely inspired by personal troubles relating to Mansons failed marriage to Von Teese, and his burgeoning relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood . The band made their debut appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on October 31, 2006, performing their cover of This Is Halloween from a deluxe edition re-release of The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack. This would be their last performance featuring longtime keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy, who would go on to file a $20m lawsuit against the band the following year for unpaid partnership proceeds .     The album was preceded by the release of a single, Heart-Shaped Glasses , whose music video was shot using director James Cameron s 3D Fusion Camera System technology. The video caused controversy upon release, with several sources claiming that it featured genuine footage of Manson and Wood engaged in sexual intercourse. Wood was reportedly paid the highest video salary in history to appear in the video. Eat Me, Drink Me was released on June 5, 2007, and entered the Billboard 200 at number eight with first week sales of 88,000 copies. It also peaked in the top ten of most major international album charts, as well as at number two on Billboards European Albums Chart. Putting Holes In Happiness was released as the albums second single.     To promote the album, the band embarked on the nine-month Rape of the World Tour , which featured Sköld on lead guitar, former The Prodigy bassist Rob Holliday and longtime drummer Ginger Fish; while Vrenna rejoined the band as their live keyboardist.
