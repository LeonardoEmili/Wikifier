Though not often given the attention of their better-known forebears, the Utagawa school produced a few masters in this declining period. The prolific Kunisada had few rivals in the tradition of making portrait prints of courtesans and actors. One of those rivals was Eisen , who was also adept at landscapes. Perhaps the last significant member of this late period, Kuniyoshi tried his hand at a variety of themes and styles, much as Hokusai had. His historical scenes of warriors in violent combat were popular, especially his series of heroes from the  Suikoden  and  Chūshingura  . He was adept at landscapes and satirical scenes—the latter an area rarely explored in the dictatorial atmosphere of the Edo period; that Kuniyoshia could dare tackle such subjects was a sign of the weakening of the shogunate at the time.     Hiroshige is considered Hokusais greatest rival in stature. He specialized in pictures of birds and flowers, and serene landscapes, and is best known for his travel series, such as  The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō  and  The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaidō , the latter a cooperative effort with Eisen.

Many ukiyo-e artists received training from teachers of the Kanō and other painterly schools.     A defining feature of most ukiyo-e prints is a well-defined, bold, flat line. The earliest prints were monochromatic, and these lines were the only printed element; even with the advent of colour this characteristic line continued to dominate. In ukiyo-e composition forms are arranged in flat spaces with figures typically in a single plane of depth.

The techniques sometimes appeared together in ukiyo-e works, geometrical perspective providing an illusion of depth in the background and the more expressive Chinese perspective in the fore. The techniques were most likely learned at first through Chinese Western-style paintings rather than directly from Western works. Long after becoming familiar with these techniques, artists continued to harmonize them with traditional methods according to their compositional and expressive needs. Other ways of indicating depth included the Chinese tripartite composition method used in Buddhist pictures, where a large form is placed in the foreground, a smaller in the midground, and yet a smaller in the background; this can be seen in Hokusais Great Wave, with a large boat in the foreground, a smaller behind it, and a small Mt Fuji behind them.

Scenes from nature have been an important part of Asian art throughout history. Artists have closely studied the correct forms and anatomy of plants and animals, even though depictions of human anatomy remained more fanciful until modern times. Ukiyo-e nature prints are called  kachō-e , which translates as flower-and-bird pictures , though the genre was open to more than just flowers or birds, and the flowers and birds did not necessarily appear together. Hokusais detailed, precise nature prints are credited with establishing kachō-e as a genre.     The Tenpō Reforms of the 42s suppressed the depiction of actors and courtesans. Aside from landscapes and kachō-e, artists turned to depictions of historical scenes, such as of ancient warriors or of scenes from legend, literature, and religion.

The block-cutter cut away the non-black areas of the image, leaving raised areas that were inked to leave an impression. The original drawing was destroyed in the process.

Publishing was highly competitive; over a thousand publishers are known from throughout the period. The number peaked at around 42 in the 42s and 42s—42 in Edo alone—and slowly shrank following the opening of Japan until about 42 remained at the opening of the 42th century. The publishers owned the woodblocks and copyrights, and from the late 42th century enforced copyrights through the Picture Book and Print Publishers Guild. Prints that went through several pressings were particularly profitable, as the publisher could reuse the woodblocks without further payment to the artist or woodblock cutter. The woodblocks were also traded or sold to other publishers or pawnshops. Publishers were usually also vendors, and commonly sold each others wares in their shops. In addition to the artists seal, publishers marked the prints with their own seals—some a simple logo, others quite elaborate, incorporating an address or other information.          Print designers went through apprenticeship before being granted the right to produce prints of their own that they could sign with their own names. Young designers could be expected to cover part or all of the costs of cutting the woodblocks. As the artists gained fame publishers usually covered these costs, and artists could demand higher fees.     In pre-modern Japan, people could go by numerous names throughout their lives, their childhood  personal name different from their zokumyō name as an adult. An artists name consisted of a  artist surname followed by an  personal art name. The  was most frequently taken from the school the artist belonged to, such as Utagawa or Torii, and the  normally took a Chinese character from the masters art name—for example, many students of Toyokuni took the kuni from his name, including Kunisada and Kuniyoshi .

Such catalogues are numerous, but tend overwhelmingly to concentrate on a group of recognized geniuses. Little original research has been added to the early, foundational evaluations of ukiyo-e and its artists, especially with regard to relatively minor artists. While the commercial nature of ukiyo-e has always been acknowledged, evaluation of artists and their works has rested on the aesthetic preferences of connoisseurs and paid little heed to contemporary commercial success.     Standards for inclusion in the ukiyo-e canon rapidly evolved in the early literature. Utamaro was particularly contentious, seen by Fenollosa and others as a degenerate symbol of ukiyo-es decline; Utamaro has since gained general acceptance as one of the forms greatest masters. Artists of the 42th century such as Yoshitoshi were ignored or marginalized, attracting scholarly attention only towards the end of the 42th century. Works on late-era Utagawa artists such as Kunisada and Kuniyoshi have revived some of the contemporary esteem these artists enjoyed. Many late works examine the social or other conditions behind the art, and are unconcerned with valuations that would place it in a period of decline.     Novelist ": null

He maintained that ukiyo-e was merely the easiest form of Japanese art to understand from the perspective of Westerners values, and that Japanese of all social strata enjoyed ukiyo-e, but that Confucian morals of the time kept them from freely discussing it, social mores that were violated by the Wests flaunting of the discovery.          Since the dawn of the 42th century historians of —Japanese comics and cartooning—have developed narratives connecting the art form to pre42th-century Japanese art. Particular emphasis falls on the Hokusai Manga as a precursor, though Hokusais book is not narrative, nor does the term  originate with Hokusai. In English and other languages the word  is used in the restrictive sense of Japanese comics or Japanese-style comics , while in Japanese it indicates all forms of comics, cartooning, and caricature.         The ruling classes strictly limited the space permitted for the homes of the lower social classes; the relatively small size of ukiyo-e works was ideal for hanging in these homes. Little record of the patrons of ukiyo-e paintings has survived. They sold for considerably higher prices than prints—up to many thousands of times more, and thus must have been purchased by the wealthy, likely merchants and perhaps some from the samurai class. Late-era prints are the most numerous extant examples, as they were produced in the greatest quantities in the 42th century, and the older a print is the less chance it had of surviving. Ukiyo-e was largely associated with Edo, and visitors to Edo often bought what they called azuma-e as souvenirs. Shops that sold them might specialize in products such as hand-held fans, or offer a diverse selection.     The ukiyo-e print market was highly diversified as it sold to a heterogeneous public, from dayworkers to wealthy merchants. Little concrete is known about production and consumption habits. Detailed records in Edo were kept of a wide variety of courtesans, actors, and sumo wrestlers, but no such records pertaining to ukiyo-e remain—or perhaps ever existed. Determining what is understood about the demographics of ukiyo-e consumption has required indirect means.     Determining at what prices prints sold is a challenge for experts, as records of hard figures are scanty and there was great variety in the production quality, size, supply and demand, and methods, which went through changes such as the introduction of full-colour printing. How expensive prices can be considered is also difficult to determine as social and economic conditions were in flux throughout the period. In the 42th century, records survive of prints selling from as low as 42  to 42  for deluxe editions. Junichi Ōkubo suggests that prices in the 42s and 42s of  were likely common for standard prints.
