Every smooth manifold defined in this way has a natural diffeology, for which the plots correspond to the smooth maps from open subsets of R n to the manifold. With this diffeology, a map between two smooth manifolds is smooth if and only if it is differentiable in the diffeological sense. Hence the smooth manifolds with smooth maps form a full subcategory of the diffeological spaces.     This allows one to give an alternative definition of smooth manifold which makes no reference to transition maps or to a specific atlas: a smooth manifold is a diffeological space which is locally diffeomorphic to R n .     The relationship between smooth manifolds and diffeological spaces is analogous to the relationship between topological manifolds and topological spaces.     This method of modeling diffeological spaces can be extended to other locals models, for instance: orbifolds, modeled on quotient spaces R n /Γ, where Γ is a finite linear subgroup, or manifolds with boundary and corners, modeled on ": null
