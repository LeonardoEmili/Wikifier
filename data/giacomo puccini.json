It was a popular success, and remains one of the most frequently performed operas ever written.     The libretto of the opera, freely adapted from Murgers episodic novel, combines comic elements of the impoverished life of the young protagonists with the tragic aspects, such as the death of the young seamstress Mimí. Puccinis own life as a young man in Milan served as a source of inspiration for elements of the libretto. During his years as a conservatory student and in the years before Manon Lescaut, he experienced poverty similar to that of the bohemians in La bohème, including chronic shortage of necessities like food, clothing and money to pay rent. Although Puccini was granted a small monthly stipend by the Congregation of Charity in Rome , he frequently had to pawn his possessions to cover basic expenses.  Early biographers such as Wakeling Dry and Eugenio Checchi, who were Puccinis contemporaries, drew express parallels between these incidents and particular events in the opera. Checchi cited a diary kept by Puccini while he was still a student, which recorded an occasion in which, as in Act 4 of the opera, a single herring served as a dinner for four people. Puccini himself commented: I lived that Bohème, when there wasnt yet any thought stirring in my brain of seeking the theme of an opera .      Puccinis composition of La bohème was the subject of a public dispute between Puccini and fellow composer Ruggiero Leoncavallo. In early 1893, the two composers discovered that they were both engaged in writing operas based on Murgers work. Leoncavallo had started his work first, and he and his music publisher claimed to have priority on the subject . Puccini responded that he started his own work without having any knowledge of Leoncavallos project, and wrote: Let him compose. I will compose. The audience will decide. Puccinis opera premiered a year before that of Leoncavallo, and has been a perennial audience favorite, while Leoncavallos version quickly faded into obscurity.

Phillips-Matz, pp. 106–07        The music of Tosca employs musical signatures for particular characters and emotions, which have been compared to Wagnerian leitmotivs, and some contemporaries saw Puccini as thereby adopting a new musical style influenced by Wagner. Others viewed the work differently. Rejecting the allegation that Tosca displayed Wagnerian influences, a critic reporting on the 20 February 1900 Torino premiere wrote: I dont think you could find a more Puccinian score than this.        On 25 February 1903, Puccini was seriously injured in a car crash during a nighttime journey on the road from Lucca to Torre del Lago. The car was driven by Puccinis chauffeur and was carrying Puccini, his future wife Elvira, and their son Antonio. It went off the road, fell several metres, and flipped over. Elvira and Antonio were flung from the car and escaped with minor injuries. Puccinis chauffeur, also thrown from the car, suffered a serious fracture of his femur. Puccini was pinned under the vehicle, with a severe fracture of his right leg and with a portion of the car pressing down on his chest. A doctor living near the scene of the crash, together with another person who came to investigate, saved Puccini from the wreckage.  The injury did not heal well, and Puccini remained under treatment for months. During the medical examinations that he underwent it was also found that he was suffering from a form of diabetes.

The libretto of Edgar was a significant factor in the failure of that opera. Thereafter, especially throughout his middle and late career, Puccini was extremely selective, and at times indecisive, in his choice of subject matter for new works. Puccini was deeply involved in the process of writing the libretto itself, requiring many iterative revisions of his libretti in terms of both structure and text. Puccinis relationships with his librettists were at times very difficult. His publisher, Casa Ricordi, was frequently required to mediate disputes and impasses between them. Phillips-Matz     Puccini explored many possible subjects that he ultimately rejected only after a significant amount of effort—such as the creation of a libretto—had been put into them.

Phillips-Matz, p. 223     In 1909, Puccinis wife Elvira publicly accused Doria Manfredi, a maid working for the Puccini family, of having an affair with the composer. After being publicly accused of adultery, Doria Manfredi committed suicide. An autopsy determined, however, that Doria had died a virgin, refuting the allegations made against her. Elvira Puccini was prosecuted for slander, and was sentenced to more than five months in prison, although a payment to the Manfredi family by Puccini spared Elvira from having to serve the sentence. Some music critics and interpreters of Puccinis work have speculated that the psychological effects of this incident on Puccini interfered with his ability to complete compositions later in his career, and also influenced the development of his characters such as Liù , a slave girl who dies tragically by suicide.

Puccinis long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization. Puccini was also criticized during the war for his work on La rondine under a 1913 commission contract with an Austrian theater after Italy and Austria-Hungary became opponents in the war in 1914 . Puccini did not participate in the public war effort, but privately rendered assistance to individuals and families affected by the war.     In 1919, Puccini was commissioned to write music to an ode by  honoring Italys victories in World War I. The work, Inno a Roma , was to premiere on 21 April 1919, during a celebration of the anniversary of the founding of Rome. The premiere was delayed to 1 June 1919, when it was played at the opening of a gymnastics competition.

Wilson , 192 The Italian Senate has traditionally included a small number of members appointed in recognition of their cultural contributions to the nation. Puccini hoped to attain this honor, which had been granted to Verdi, and undertook to use his connections to bring about the appointment. While honorary senators could vote, there is no indication that Puccini sought the appointment for this purpose. Puccini also wished to establish a national theater in Viareggio, a project which would require government support. Puccini met with Mussolini twice, in November and December 1923, seeking support for the theater project. While the theater project never came to fruition, Puccini was named Senator  a few months before his death.

In 1926 his son arranged for the transfer of his fathers remains to a specially created chapel inside the Puccini villa at Torre del Lago.       Most broadly, Puccini wrote in the style of the late-Romantic period of classical music .  Music historians also refer to Puccini as a component of the  giovane scuola  , a cohort of composers who came onto the Italian operatic scene as Verdis career came to an end, such as Mascagni, Leoncavallo, and others mentioned below. Puccini is also frequently referred to as a  verismo  composer.      Puccinis career extended from the end of the Romantic period into the modern period. He consciously attempted to update his style to keep pace with new trends, but did not attempt to fully adopt a modern style. One critic, Anthony Davis has stated: Loyalty toward nineteenth-century Italian-opera traditions and, more generally, toward the musical language of his Tuscan heritage is one of the clearest features of Puccinis music. Davis also identifies, however, a stylistic pluralism in Puccinis work, including influences from the German symphonic tradition, French harmonic and orchestrational traditions, and, to a lesser extent, aspects of Wagnerian chromaticism . In addition, Puccini frequently sought to introduce music or sounds from outside sources into his operas, such as his use of Chinese folk melodies in Turandot.     All of Puccinis operas have at least one set piece for a lead singer that is separate enough from its surroundings that it can be treated as a distinct aria, and most of his works have several of these. At the same time, Puccinis work continued the trend away from operas constructed from a series of set pieces, and instead used a more through-composed or integrated construction. His works are strongly melodic. In orchestration, Puccini frequently doubled the vocal line in unison or at octaves in order to emphasize and strengthen the melodic line.     Verismo is a style of Italian opera that began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagnis Cavalleria rusticana, peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s. Verismo in Stanley Sadie The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians, London: Macmillan/New York: Grove, 1980, vol. 19, p. 670,  The style is distinguished by realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of everyday life, especially the life of the contemporary lower classes.

Some view Puccini as essentially a verismo composer, while others, although acknowledging that he took part in the movement to some degree, do not view him as a pure verismo composer.  In addition, critics differ as to the degree to which particular operas by Puccini are, or are not, properly described as verismo operas.

Puccini has, however, consistently been the target of condescension by some music critics who find his music insufficiently sophisticated or difficult.  Some have explicitly condemned his efforts to please his audience, such as this contemporary Italian critic:   He willingly stops himself at minor genius, stroking the taste of the public ... obstinately shunning too-daring innovation ... A little heroism, but not taken to great heights; a little bit of veristic comedy, but brief; a lot of sentiment and romantic idyll: this is the recipe in which he finds happiness.       Budden attempted to explain the paradox of Puccinis immense popular success and technical mastery on the one hand, and the relative disregard in which his work has been held by academics:   No composer communicates more directly with an audience than Puccini. Indeed, for many years he has remained a victim of his own popularity; hence the resistance to his music in academic circles. Be it remembered, however, that Verdis melodies were once dismissed as barrel-organ fodder. The truth is that music that appeals immediately to a public becomes subject to bad imitation, which can cast a murky shadow over the original. So long as counterfeit Puccinian melody dominated the world of sentimental operetta, many found it difficult to come to terms with the genuine article. Now that the current coin of light music has changed, the composer admired by Schoenberg, Ravel, and Stravinsky can be seen to emerge in his full stature.             Puccini wrote orchestral pieces, sacred music, chamber music, solo music for piano and organ and songs for voice and piano, most notably his 1880 mass  Messa di gloria , his Preludio Sinfonico of 1882, and his 1890 string quartet movement Crisantemi.
