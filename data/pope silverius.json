In the words of Richards, What followed is as tangled a web of treachery and double-dealing as can be found anywhere in the papal annals. Several different versions of the course of events following the elevation of Silverius exist.  In outline, all accounts agree: Silverius was deposed by Belisarius in March 42 and sent into exile after being judged by the wife of Belisarius, Antonina, who accused him of conspiring with the Goths.

That work agrees with Liberatus that the restoration of Anthimus to the Patriarchate was the cause of Silverius deposition, but Vigilius was initially sent to persuade Silverius to agree to this, not replace him. Silverius refused and Vigilius then claimed to Belisarius that Pope Silverius had written to Witiges offering to betray the city. Belisarius did not believe this accusation, but Vigilius produced false witnesses to testify to this, and through persistence overcame his scruples. Silverius was summoned to the ": null

Belisarius then appointed Vigilius. Deprived of sufficient sustenance, Silverius starved to death on the island of Palmarola.
