After three years on the road with no evident success, the 21-year-old Jerome decided that he had enough of stage life and sought other occupations. He tried to become a journalist, writing essays, satires, and short stories, but most of these were rejected. Over the next few years, he was a school teacher, a packer, and a solicitors clerk. Finally, in 1885, he had some success with  On the Stage – and Off  , a comic memoir of his experiences with the acting troupe, followed by  Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow  , a collection of humorous essays which had previously appeared in the newly founded magazine,  Home Chimes ,  at Google Books.

In the novel, his wife was replaced by his longtime friends George Wingrave and Carl Hentschel . This allowed him to create comic situations which were nonetheless intertwined with the history of the Thames region. The book, published in 1889, became an instant success and has never been out of print. Its popularity was such that the number of registered Thames boats went up fifty percent in the year following its publication, and it contributed significantly to the Thames becoming a tourist attraction.
