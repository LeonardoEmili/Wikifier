The need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system as a whole, which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the sum of the parts properties, motivated various industries, especially those developing systems for the U.S. Military, to apply the discipline.      When it was no longer possible to rely on design evolution to improve upon a system and the existing tools were not sufficient to meet growing demands, new methods began to be developed that addressed the complexity directly.

The aim of education in systems engineering is to formalize various approaches simply and in doing so, identify new methods and research opportunities similar to that which occurs in other fields of engineering. As an approach, systems engineering is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavour.       The traditional scope of engineering embraces the conception, design, development, production and operation of physical systems. Systems engineering, as originally conceived, falls within this scope. Systems engineering , in this sense of the term, refers to the building of engineering concepts.       The use of the term systems engineer has evolved over time to embrace a wider, more holistic concept of systems and of engineering processes. This evolution of the definition has been a subject of ongoing controversy,  and the term continues to apply to both the narrower and broader scope.     Traditional systems engineering was seen as a branch of engineering in the classical sense, that is, as applied only to physical systems, such as spacecraft and aircraft. More recently, systems engineering has evolved to a take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential component of a system. Checkland, for example, captures the broader meaning of systems engineering by stating that engineering can be read in its general sense; you can engineer a meeting or a political agreement.       Consistent with the broader scope of systems engineering, the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge  Pyster, Arthur, ed. 2012. Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge. 1.0 ed: Stephens Institute and the Naval Postgraduate School. has defined three types of systems engineering: Product Systems Engineering is the traditional systems engineering focused on the design of physical systems consisting of hardware and software. Enterprise Systems Engineering pertains to the view of enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as systems. Service Systems Engineering has to do with the engineering of service systems. Checkland defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system. Most civil infrastructure systems are service systems.

Depending on their application, although there are several models that are used in the industry, all of them aim to identify the relation between the various stages mentioned above and incorporate feedback.

By providing a systems  view of the development effort, systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a unified team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and, in some cases, to termination and disposal. In an acquisition, the holistic integrative discipline combines contributions and balances tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance while maintaining an acceptable level of risk covering the entire life cycle of the item.      This perspective is often replicated in educational programs, in that systems engineering courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments, which helps create an interdisciplinary environment.         The need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects, Yassine, A. and Braha, D. .  Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications 11 : 165â€“177.

When speaking in this context, complexity incorporates not only engineering systems, but also the logical human organization of data.

Any or each of the above methods are used in an industry based on its requirements. For instance, the N2 chart may be used where interfaces between systems is important. Part of the design phase is to create structural and behavioral models of the system.     Once the requirements are understood, it is now the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A ": null
