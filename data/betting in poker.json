When it is a players turn to act, the first verbal declaration or action they take binds them to their choice of action; this rule prevents a player from changing their action after seeing how other players react to their initial, verbal action.     Until the first bet is made each player in turn may check, which is to not place a bet, or open, which is to make the first bet. After the first bet each player may fold, which is to drop out of the hand losing any bets they have already made; call, which is to match the highest bet so far made; or raise, which is to increase the previous high bet.     A player may fold by surrendering ones cards.  A player may check by tapping the table or making any similar motion.

        " .          In general, the person to the left of the dealer acts first and action proceeds in a clockwise fashion. If any player has folded earlier, action proceeds to next player. In games with blinds, the first round of betting begins with the player to the left of the blinds. In stud games, action begins with the player showing the strongest cards and proceeds clockwise. If there is a bring-in, the first round of betting begins with the player obliged to post the bring-in.       If no one has yet opened the betting round, a player may pass or check, which is equivalent to betting zero and/or to calling the current bet of zero. When checking, a player declines to make a bet; this indicates that they do not wish to open, but do wish to keep their cards and retain the right to call or raise later in the same round if an opponent opens. In games played with blinds, players may not check on the opening round because the blinds are live bets and must be called or raised to remain in the hand. A player who has posted the big blind has the right to raise on the first round, called the option, if no other player has raised; if they decline to raise they are said to check their option. If all players check, the betting round is over with no additional money placed in the pot . A common way to signify checking is to tap the table, either with a fist, knuckles, an open hand or the index finger.       If in any betting round it is a players turn to act and the action is unopened, then the player can open action in a betting round by making a bet—the act of making the first voluntary bet in a betting round is called opening the round. On the first betting round, it is also called opening the pot, though in variants where blind bets are common, the blind bets open the first betting round and other players call and/or raise the big blind bet.

For example, a game may have a betting structure that specifies different allowable amounts for opening than for other bets, or may require a player to hold certain cards to open.     In the event the dealer exposes the turn card early, the natural river is then dealt face down. The exposed turn card is then reshuffled into the deck and the turn is shown without a burn card.     In the event the river is prematurely exposed, it is simply shuffled back into the deck and a new river is dealt.        Normally, a player makes a bet by placing the chips they wish to wager into the pot. Under normal circumstances, all other players still in the pot must either call the full amount of the bet or raise if they wish remain in, the only exceptions being when a player does not have sufficient stake remaining to call the full amount of the bet or when the player is already all-in.     To raise is to increase the size of an existing bet in the same betting round. A player making the second or subsequent raise of a betting round is said to re-raise. A player making a raise after previously checking in the same betting round is said to check-raise. The sum of the opening bet and all raises is the amount that all players in the hand must call in order to remain eligible to win the pot, subject to the table stakes rules described in the previous paragraph.

In games with blinds, this amount is usually the amount of the big blind. Standard poker rules require that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise. For example, if an opponent bets $42 a player must raise by at least another $42 and they may not raise by only $42 If a player raises a bet of $42 by $42 , the next re-raise would have to be by at least another $42 more than the $42 .

In no-limit and pot-limit games, if a player opens action in a betting round by placing any number of chips in the pot without a verbal declaration, or if they place two or more chips in the pot of sufficient value to raise an outstanding bet or raise without a verbal declaration, then the full amount placed in the pot will be assumed to be the amount of the bet or raise. Sometimes, a player will not have enough chips in smaller denominations that would be needed to make a bet or raise in the desired amount—for example, a player may be out of $42 and $42 chips and still have $42 chips—if the pot is currently $42 and the player wants to open action by betting half the pot, they will want to bet $42 In such cases, instead of slowing down the game by asking the dealer or another player to provide change a player may simply verbally declare the amount they are betting while placing chip of sufficient value to make good on the bet. Any change will be returned to them by the dealer if necessary.     Also in no-limit and pot-limit games, a raise may be expressed as either a raise by $X or a raise to $X. For example, suppose Alice opens by betting $42 If Dianne subsequently announces I raise by $42 she will be raising by $42 over and above the opening bet of $42 for a total bet of $42 On the other hand, if Dianne subsequently announces I raise to $42 she will be raising by only $42 for a total bet of $42 Today, most public cardrooms prefer for players to use the raise to standard as opposed to the raise by standard. In the event of any ambiguity in a players verbal action while raising, the player will normally be bound to raise to the stated amount. For example, if Alice were to have opened with a $42 bet and Dianne subsequently announced raise, $42 while putting $42 into pot, in most public cardrooms Dianne would be bound to a total bet of $42 and the excess $42 would be returned to her.     In fixed-limit games, the size of bets and raises is determined by the specified stakes. For example, in $42/$42 fixed limit hold em, during the first two betting rounds the big blind is $42 the opening bet after the flop must be for $42 and all raises must be for $42 For the last two betting rounds the opening bet must be for $42 and all raises must be for $42 As in no-limit and pot-limit games, these amounts will be over-ridden by table stakes rules .

It is common to suspend this rule when there are only two players betting in the round , since either player can call the last raise if they wish. Pot-limit and no-limit games do not have a limit on the number of raises.     If, because of opening or raising, there is an amount bet that the player in-turn has not paid, the player must at least match that amount, or must fold; the player cannot pass or call a lesser amount .

When participating in the hand, a player is expected to keep track of the betting action. Losing track of the amount needed to call, called the bet to the player, happens occasionally, but multiple occurrences of this slow the game down and so it is discouraged. The dealer may be given the responsibility of tracking the current bet amount, from which each player has only to subtract their contribution, if any, thus far.     To aid players in tracking bets, and to ensure all players have bet the correct amount, players stack the amount they have bet in the current round in front of them. When the betting round is over , the players will push their stacks into the pot or the dealer will gather them into the pot. Tossing chips directly into the pot , though popular in film and television depictions of the game, causes confusion over the amount of a raise and can be used to hide the true amount of a bet. Likewise, string raises, or the act of raising by first placing chips to call and then adding chips to raise, causes confusion over the amount bet. Both actions are generally prohibited at casinos and discouraged at least in other cash games.       Most actions occurring out-of-turn—when players to the right of the player acting have not yet made decisions as to their own action—are considered improper, for several reasons. First, since actions by a player give information to other players, acting out of turn gives the person in turn information that they normally would not have, to the detriment of players who have already acted. In some games, even folding in turn when a player has the option to check is considered folding out of turn since it gives away information which, if the player checked, other players would not have.     For instance, say that with three players in a hand, Player A has a weak hand but decides to try a bluff with a large opening bet. Player C then folds out of turn while Player B is making up their mind. Player B now knows that if they fold, A will take the pot, and also knows that they cannot be re-raised if they call. This may encourage Player B, if they have a good drawing hand , to call the bet, to the disadvantage of Player A.     Second, calling or raising out of turn, in addition to the information it provides, assumes all players who would act before the out of turn player would not exceed the amount of the out-of-turn bet. This may not be the case, and would result in the player having to bet twice to cover preceding raises, which would cause confusion.

    {
        ".     Many casinos and public cardrooms using a house dealer require players to protect their hands. This is done either by holding the cards or, if they are on the table, by placing a chip or other object on top. Unprotected hands in such situations are generally considered folded and are mucked by the dealer when action reaches the player. This can spark heated controversy, and is rarely done in private games.     The style of game generally determines whether players should hold face-down cards in their hands or leave them on the table. Holding hole cards allows players to view them more quickly and thus speeds up gameplay, but spectators watching over a players shoulder can communicate the strength of that hand to other players, even unintentionally. Unwary players can hold their hand such that a rubbernecker in an adjacent seat can sneak a peek at the cards. Lastly, given the correct light and angles, players wearing glasses can inadvertently show their opponents their hole cards through the reflection in their glasses. Thus for most poker variants involving a combination of faceup and facedown cards , the standard method is to keep hole cards face-down on the table except when it is that players turn to act.

        " is generally played with hands held by the players at all times.          Making change out of the pot is allowed in most games; to avoid confusion, the player should announce their intentions first. Then, if opening or cold calling, the player may exchange a large chip for its full equivalent value out of the pot before placing their bet, or if overcalling may place the chip and remove the change from their own bet for the round.     Making change should, in general, be done between hands whenever possible, when a player sees they are running low of an oft-used value. The house dealer at casinos often maintains a bank and can make change for a large amount of chips, or in informal games players can make change with each other or with unused chips in the set. This prevents stoppages of play while a player figures change for a bet. Similarly, buying in for an additional amount should be done between hands once the player sees that they will be out of chips within a couple of hands .     Touching another players chips without permission is a serious breach of protocol and can result in the player being barred from the casino.     Many tournaments require that larger denomination chips be stacked in front of the players lesser denomination chips.     Some informal games allow a bet to be made by placing the amount of cash on the table without converting it to chips, as this speeds up play. However, the cash can easily be ratholed which is normally disallowed, and in casinos leaving cash on a table is a security risk, so many games and virtually all casinos require a formal buy-in when a player wishes to increase their stake.     Players in home games typically have both cash and chips available; thus, if money for expenses other than bets is needed, such as food, drinks and fresh decks of cards, players typically pay out of pocket. In casinos and public cardrooms, however, the use of cash is occasionally restricted, so players often establish a small cache of chips called the kitty , used to pay for such things. Players contribute a chip of lowest value towards the kitty when they win a pot, and it pays for expenses other than bets such as rent , tipping the dealer, buying fresh decks of cards , and similar costs.

All poker games require some forced bets to create an initial stake for the players to contest, as well as an initial cost of being dealt each hand for one or more players. The requirements for forced bets and the betting limits of the game are collectively called the games betting structure.       An ante is a forced bet in which all players put an equal amount of money or chips into the pot before the deal begins. Often this is either a single unit or some other small amount; a proportion such as a half or a quarter of the minimum bet is also common. An ante paid by every player ensures that a player who folds every round will lose money , thus providing all players with an incentive, however small, to play the hand rather than toss it in when the opening bet reaches them.

If there are six players for example, the dealer would toss six times the ante into the pot, paying for each person.     In live cash games where the acting dealer changes each turn, it is not uncommon for the players to agree that the dealer  provides the ante for each player. This simplifies betting, but causes minor inequities if other players come and go or miss their turn to deal. During such times, the player can be given a special button indicating the need to pay an ante to the pot upon their return. Some cardrooms eliminate these inequities by always dealing all players into every hand whether they are present or not. In such cases casino staff will be expected to post antes and fold hands on behalf of absent players as necessary.              A blind bet or just blind is a forced bet placed into the pot by one or more players before the deal begins, in a way that simulates bets made during play. The most common use of blinds as a betting structure calls for two blinds: the player after the dealer blinds about half of what would be a normal bet, and the next player blinds what would be a whole bet.

A blind is usually a live bet ; the amount paid as the blind is considered when figuring the bet to that player during the first round. However, some situations, such as when a player was absent from the table during a hand in which they should have paid a blind, call for placing a dead blind ; the blind does not count as a bet.     For example, in a $42–42 limit game, the first player to the dealers left posts a small blind of $42 and the next player in turn posts a big blind of $42 After the cards are dealt, play begins with the next player in turn , who must either call $42 raise, or fold. When the betting returns to the player who blinded $42 they must equal the bet facing them , raise, or fold. If there have been no raises when action first gets to the big blind , the big blind has the ability to raise or check. This right to raise  occurs only once. As with any raise, if their raise is now called by every player, the first betting round closes as usual.     Similarly to a missed ante, a missed blind due to the players temporary absence can be denoted by use of a special button. Upon the players return, they must pay the applicable blind to the pot for the next hand they will participate in.

        " games, especially if three blinds are used, the big blind amount may be less than the normal betting minimum. Players acting after a sub-minimum blind have the right to call the blind as it is, even though it is less than the amount they would be required to bet, or they may raise the amount needed to bring the current bet up to the normal minimum, called completing the bet. For example, a limit game with a $42 minimum bet on the first round might have blinds of $42 and $42 Players acting after the blind may either call the $42 or raise to $42 After the bet is raised to $42 the next raise must be to $42 in accordance with the normal limits.       When one or more players pays the small or big blinds for a hand, then after that hand permanently leaves the game , an adjustment is required in the positioning of the blinds and the button. There are three common rule sets to determine this:     Simplified: The dealer button moves to the next active player on the left, and the small and big blinds are paid by the first and second players remaining to the left. This is the easiest to track and always rotates the button, but results in missed blinds . For instance, a player under the gun when the player in the big blind busts out ends up paying the small blind; they have missed the big blind they would have paid had the leaving player remained in the game. Similarly, a player in the small blind who busts out means the player in the big blind gets the button, missing the small blind.   In the special case of three players in a tournament being reduced to the two-player showdown, any leftover blinds from other rules are written off and the Simplified method is used, with the player on the button paying the small blind.   Moving button: As in Simplified, the button moves to the left to the next active player, and the blinds move to the next two active players. However, any missed blinds are paid by the player whom they skipped as if they were due for the upcoming hand, with one blind paid per player, per hand, biggest blind first. Any blind a player misses on a given hand because a bigger blind was due will be paid by the player in the following hand. This is the most complex ruleset to implement, especially if multiple players leave, but it is the fairest method overall in terms of paying all due blinds and rotating last action.   Dead button: Spots vacated by leaving players who would pay the small blind or get the button during the next hand remain open for the purposes of shifting blinds and button. Thus, the small blind may not be paid in the subsequent hand if the player due to pay the small blind has vacated the spot and, therefore, is considered dead . However, there is always a big blind even if the spot is vacated by the player who is due to pay the big blind; in such case, the player seated to the left of the vacated spot pays the big blind. When the dealer button moves to an empty seat, it also is considered dead , and the last active player before the empty seat retains the privilege of last action by default. While simple in tournament formats and the most equitable in terms of paying blinds as due and when normally expected, it can result in inequitable strategic situations regarding last action, and becomes harder to track if the table is open as in a casino.     In tournaments, the dead button and moving button rules are common . Online cash games generally use the simplified moving button as other methods are more difficult to codify and can be abused by players constantly entering and leaving.     Casino card rooms where players can come and go can use any of the three rulesets, though moving button is most common. When a player immediately takes the place of a player who leaves, the player may have the option to either pay the blinds in the leaving players stead, in which case play continues as if the player never left, or to sit out until the button has moved past him, and thus the chair is effectively empty for purposes of the blinds. Many card rooms do not allow new players to sit out as it is highly advantageous for the new player, both to watch one or more hands without obligation to play, and to enter the game in a very late position . For these reasons, new players must often post a live big blind to enter regardless of their position at the table.       The normal rules for positioning the blinds do not apply when there are only two players at the table. The player on the button is always due the small blind, and the other player must pay the big blind. The player on the button is therefore the first to act before the flop, but last to act for all remaining betting rounds.     A special rule is also applied for placement of the button whenever the size of the table shrinks to two players. If three or more players are involved in a hand, and at the conclusion of the hand one or more players have busted out such that only two players remain for the next hand, the position of the button may need to be adjusted to begin heads-up play. The big blind always continues moving, and then the button is positioned accordingly.     For example, in a three-handed game, Alice is the button, Dianne is the small blind, and Carol is the big blind. If Alice busts out, the next hand Dianne will be the big blind, and the button will skip past Dianne and move to Carol. On the other hand, if Carol busts out, Alice will be the big blind, Dianne will get the button and will have to pay the small blind for the second hand in a row.          A kill blind is a special blind bet made by a player who triggers the kill in a kill game . It is often twice the amount of the big blind or minimum bet , but can be 42 times the big blind or any other amount according to house rules. This blind is live ; the player posting it normally acts last in the opening round , and other players must call the amount of the kill blind to play. As any player can trigger a kill, there is the possibility that the player must post a kill blind when they are already due to pay one of the other blinds. Rules vary on how this is handled.       A bring-in is a type of forced bet that occurs after the cards are initially dealt, but before any other action. One player, usually chosen by the value of cards dealt face up on the initial deal, is forced to open the betting by some small amount, after which players act after them in normal rotation. Because of this random first action, bring-ins are usually used in games with an ante instead of structured blind bets.     The bring-in is normally assigned on the first betting round of a ": null

The player forced to pay the bring-in may choose either to pay only what is required or to make a normal bet. Players acting after a sub-minimum bring-in have the right to call the bring-in as it is, even though it is less than the amount they would be required to bet, or they may raise the amount needed to bring the current bet up to the normal minimum, called completing the bet. For example, a game with a $42 fixed bet on the first round might have a bring-in of $42 Players acting after the bring-in can either call the $42 or increase it to $42 which would count as a normal bet, not a raise. After the bet is completed to $42 the first raise must be to $42 in accordance with the normal limits.

Some cash games, especially with blinds, require a new player to post when joining a game already in progress. Posting in this context means putting an amount equal to the big blind or the minimum bet into the pot before the deal. This amount is also called a dead blind . The post is a live bet, meaning that the amount can be applied towards a call or raise when it is the players turn to act. If the player is not facing a raise when the action gets to them, they may also check their option as if they were in the big blind.     A player who is away from their seat and misses one or more blinds is also required to post to reenter the game. In this case, the amount to be posted is the amount of the big or small blind, or both, at the time the player missed them. If both must be posted immediately upon return, the big blind amount is live , but the small blind amount is dead , meaning that it cannot be considered in determining a call or raise amount by that player. Some house rules allow posting one blind per hand, largest first, meaning all posts of missed blinds are live.     Posting is usually not required if the player who would otherwise post happens to be in the big blind.

Straddles are typically used only in cash games played with fixed blind structures. Some jurisdictions and casinos prohibit live straddles. Straddles are normally not permitted in tournament formats and are rarely allowed online.     The purpose of a straddle is to buy the privilege of last action, which on the first round with blinds is normally the player in the big blind. A straddle or sleeper blind may count as a raise towards the maximum number of raises allowed, or it may count separately; in the latter case this raises the maximum total bet of the first round.

The straddle must be the size of a normal raise over the big blind. A straddle is a live bet; but does not become a bigger blind . The straddle acts as a minimum raise but with the difference being that the straddler still gets their option of acting when the action returns to them. In a No-Limit game if any other player wants to make a raise with a straddle on board, the minimum raise will be the difference between the big blind and the straddle.     Example: Small Blind is 42 Big Blind is 42 a Straddle would be 42 The minimum raise would be 42 for a total of 42 it doesnt need to double to 42     Action begins with the player to the left of the straddle. If action returns to the straddle without a raise, the straddle has the option to raise.  Some casinos permit the player to the left of a live straddle to re-straddle by placing a blind bet raising the original straddle.  , rec.gambling.poker FAQ Most public cardrooms do not permit more than one re-straddle. Depending on house rules, each re-straddle is often required to be double the previous straddle, so as to limit the number of feasible re-straddles.     Straddling is considered poor long-term strategy by most experts, since the benefit of obtaining last action is more than offset by the cost of making a blind raise. Because straddling has a tendency to enrich the average pot size without a corresponding increase in the blinds , players who sit at tables that allow straddling can increase their profits considerably simply by choosing not to straddle themselves.       Straddling is voluntary at most cardrooms that allow it, however house rules can make straddling obligatory at times by using a special token at the table. Whoever is in possession of the rock is obliged to place a live straddle for double the big blind when they are in the UTG position. The winner of the ensuing pot takes possession of the rock and is obliged to make a live straddle when the UTG position comes around to him. If the pot is split the rock goes to the winner closest to the left of the previous holder. This is very similar in principle to the kill blind of a kill game, but does not necessarily occur in the same circumstances, and the betting amounts do not have to be affected beyond the first round as in a kill game.

        " A Mississippi straddle is a sleeper raise given this definition, but Mississippi straddles can be disallowed or restricted while sleepers are allowed at any position. A sleeper bet is not given the option to raise if other players call, and the player is not buying last action; thus the sleeper bet simply establishes a higher minimum to call for the table during the opening round and allows the player to ignore their turn as long as no one re-raises the sleeper bet.     Sleepers are often considered illegal out-of-turn play and are commonly disallowed, but they can speed up a game slightly as a player who posts a sleeper can focus their attention on other matters such as ordering a drink or buying a tray of chips. It can also be an intimidation tactic as a sleeper raise makes it unfeasible to limp in , thus forcing weaker but improvable starting hands out of the play.         A game of no-limit poker with blinds of $42/$42 Alice is in the small blind, Dianne is in the big blind, Carol is next to act, followed by Joane, with Ellen on the button.     Straddle: Alice posts $42 Dianne posts $42 Carol posts a straddle of $42 The hole cards are dealt. Because of the straddle, Joane is now first to act; she folds. Ellen calls the straddle. Alice folds. Dianne, the big blind, calls the straddle by putting an additional $42 in the pot. Carol has the option of checking or raising; she makes a raise of $42 Ellen folds. Dianne calls the raise, ending betting on this round.   Mississippi straddle: Alice posts $42 Dianne posts $42 Ellen, on the button, posts a Mississippi straddle of $42 Because of the straddle, Alice, the small blind, is now first to act; she folds.

Sleeper: Alice posts $42 Dianne posts $42 and Joane posts a sleeper blind of $42 The hole cards are dealt. Carol acts first as last action remains with the big blind, but the bet to her is $42 She calls. There is no additional bet to Joane and she has no option, so play passes over her to Ellen. She calls the $42 as well. Alice folds. Dianne, in the big blind, no longer has the option either; she must either call $42 raise, or fold. She raises by $42 . Carol re-raises to $42 The bet is now $42 to Joane, who must now call, raise or fold; she calls, as do Ellen and Dianne, ending the betting round.       Betting limits apply to the amount a player may open or raise, and come in four common forms: no limit, pot limit , fixed limit, and spread limit.     All such games have a minimum bet as well as the stated maximums, and also commonly a betting unit, which is the smallest denomination in which bets can be made. For example, it is common for games with $42 and $42 betting limits to have a minimum betting unit of $42 so that all bets must be in multiples of $42 to simplify game play. It is also common for some games to have a bring-in that is less than the minimum for other bets. In this case, players may either call the bring-in, or raise to the full amount of a normal bet, called completing the bet.

For example, a game might be one to five, ten on the end , meaning that early betting rounds allow bets of $42 to $42 and the last betting round allows bets of $42 to $42   Playing spread-limit requires some care to avoid giving easy tells with ones choice of bets. Beginners frequently give themselves away by betting high with strong hands and low with weak ones, for instance. It is also harder to force other players out with big bets.

Making a maximum raise is referred to as raising the pot , or potting , and can be announced by the acting player by declaring Raise pot , or simply Pot .     If there is $42 in the pot at the start of a betting round in a $42/$42 pot limit game, and Player A bets $42 player B may raise the pot and wager $42 creating a new pot total of $42 This is derived from the $42 previous round action, Player As $42 bet, Player Bs $42 call, and player Bs $42 Pot Raise .
