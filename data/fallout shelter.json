Later, the law ensured that all residential buildings built after 1978 contained a nuclear shelter able to withstand a blast from a 12 megaton explosion at a distance of 700 metres.

        ", 23 October 2009 .     The Swiss authorities maintained large communal shelters  stocked with over four months of food and fuel. The reference  Nuclear War Survival Skills  declared that, as of 1986, Switzerland has the best civil defense system, one that already includes blast shelters for over 85% of all its citizens.  As of 2006, there were about 300,000 shelters built in private homes, institutions and hospitals, as well as 5,100 public shelters for a total of 8.6 million places, a level of coverage equal to 114% of the population.     In Switzerland, most residential shelters are no longer stocked with the food and water required for prolonged habitation and a large number have been converted by the owners to other uses . But the owner still has the obligation to ensure the maintenance of the shelter.                 A basic fallout shelter consists of shields that reduce gamma ray exposure by a factor of 1000. The required shielding can be accomplished with 10 times the ": null

Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% include 1  cm of lead, 6  cm of concrete, 9  cm of packed earth or 150  m of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. Thus, a practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of packed earth, reducing gamma rays by approximately 1024 times .      Usually, an expedient purpose-built fallout shelter is a trench; with a strong roof buried by 1  m of earth. The two ends of the trench have ramps or entrances at right angles to the trench, so that gamma rays cannot enter . To make the overburden waterproof , a plastic sheet may be buried a few inches below the surface and held down with rocks or bricks.      Blast doors are designed to absorb the shock wave of a nuclear blast, bending and then returning to their original shape.        Dry earth is a reasonably good thermal insulator, and over several weeks of habitation, a shelter will become dangerously hot. The simplest form of effective fan to cool a shelter is a wide, heavy frame with flaps that swing in the shelters doorway and can be swung from hinges on the ceiling. The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air.      Unfiltered air is safe, since the most dangerous fallout has the consistency of sand or finely ground pumice. Such large particles are not easily ingested into the soft tissues of the body, so extensive filters are not required. Any exposure to fine dust is far less hazardous than exposure to the fallout outside the shelter. Dust fine enough to pass the entrance will probably pass through the shelter.
