A fourth designation, ASV for auxiliary survey vessel, included even smaller vessels.

The Coast and Geodetic Surveys system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Surveys fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.             The U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, identification numbers , and the other numbering systems described above. In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.     The combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser  was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.

Wertheim, The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, 15th Edition: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems, p. 1005.     Unlike the Navy, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, S 222 was assigned to , then assigned to NOAAS Thomas Jefferson , which entered NOAA service after Mount Mitchell was stricken.         The U.S. Navys system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Though considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows of most U.S. Navy ships.     The ship designator and hull number systems roots extend back to the late 1880s, when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging Steel Navy . During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navys clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the Jeffersonian Gunboats of the early 1800s and the Tinclad river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.     It is important to understand that hull number letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, DD does not stand for anything more than Destroyer . SS simply means Submarine . And FF is the post-1975 type code for Frigate.      The hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8B        Warships are designed to participate in combat operations.     The origin of the two-letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes. Derdall and DiGiulian,           Aircraft carriers are ships designed primarily for the purpose of conducting combat operations by aircraft which engage in attacks against airborne, surface, sub-surface and shore targets. Contrary to popular belief, the CV hull classification symbol does not stand for carrier vessel . CV derives from the cruiser designation, with the v for French voler, to fly  . Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: the first sequence runs from CV-1 USS  Langley  to the very latest ships, and the second sequence, CVE for escort carriers, ran from CVE-1 ": null
