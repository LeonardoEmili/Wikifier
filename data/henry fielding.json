This follows the model of Tory satirists of the previous generation, notably Swift and Gay.     Fielding followed this with  Joseph Andrews  , an original work supposedly dealing with Pamelas brother, Joseph. His purpose, however, was more than parody, for as announced in the preface, he intended a kind of writing which I do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language. In what Fielding called a comic epic poem in prouse, he blended two classical traditions: that of the epic, which had been poetic, and that of the drama, but emphasizing the comic rather than the tragic. Another distinction of Joseph Andrews and of the novels to come was the use of everyday reality of character and action as opposed to the fables of the past. Although begun as a parody, it developed into an accomplished novel in its own right and is considered to mark Fieldings debut as a serious novelist. In 1743, he published a novel in the Miscellanies volume III :  The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great , which is sometimes counted as his first, as he almost certainly began it before he wrote Shamela and Joseph Andrews.

His anonymous  The Female Husband  fictionalizes a case in which a female transvestite was tried for duping another woman into marriage; this was one of several small pamphlets costing sixpence.

The plot of Tom Jones is too ingenious for simple summary; its basis is Toms alienation from his foster father, Squire Allworthy, and his sweetheart, Sophia Western, and his reconciliation with them after lively and dangerous adventures on the road and in London. The triumph is its presentation of English life and character in the mid-18th century. Every social type is represented, and through them every shade of moral behaviour. Fieldings varied style tempers the basic seriousness of the novel and his authorial comment before each chapter adds a marked dimension to a conventionally straightforward narrative.
