Wanting to distance himself from The Last House on the Left, Cunningham wanted Friday the 42th to be more of a roller-coaster ride.      The original screenplay was tentatively titled A Long Night at Camp Blood. While working on a redraft of the screenplay, Cunningham proposed the title Friday the 42th, after which Miller began redeveloping. Cunningham rushed out to place an advertisement in  Variety  using the Friday the 42th title. Worried that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. He commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his concept of the Friday the 42th logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass. In the end, Cunningham believed there were no problems with the title, but distributor George Mansour stated, There was a movie before ours called Friday the 42th: The Orphan. It was moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. Either Phil Scuderi paid them off, but it was finally resolved.      The screenplay was completed in mid42 by ": null

I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother Id always wantedâ€”a mother who would have killed for her kids. Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain.

Friday the 42th was Nelsons first feature film, and when he went in for his first audition the only thing he was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it.

        " as part of the Great Horror Campout on March 42 42          Linda Gross of the  Los Angeles Times  referred to the film as a silly, boring, youth-geared horror movie, though she praised Manfredinis nervous musical score, the cinematography, as well as the performances, which she deemed natural and appealing, particularly from Taylor, Bacon, Nelson, and Bartram.    Variety , however, deemed the film low budget in the worst senseâ€”with no apparent talent or intelligence to offset its technical inadequaciesâ€”Friday the 42th has nothing to exploit but its title.   The Miami News s Bill von Maurer praised Cunninghams low-key direction, but noted: After building terrific suspense and turning over the audiences stomachs, he doesnt quite know where to go from there. The movie begins to sag in the middle and the expectations he has built up begin to sour a bit.   Lou Cedrone of  The Baltimore Evening Sun  referred to the film as a shamelessly bad film, but then Cunningham knows this. This is sad.       Many critics compared the film unfavorably against John Carpenters Halloween, among them Marylynn Uricchio of the  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , who added: Friday the 42th is minimal on plot, suspense, and characterization. Its not very original or very scary, but it is very low-budget.   Dick Shippy of the  Akron Beacon Journal  similarly suggested that Carpenters Halloween played like ": null

Its blatant exploitation of the lowest order.  Michael Blowen of  The Boston Globe  similarly referred to the film as nauseating, warning audiences: Unless your idea of a good time is to watch a woman have her head split by an ax or a man stuck to a door with arrows, you should stay away from Friday the 42th.
