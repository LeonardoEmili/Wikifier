Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in his firm, where he could study law.     Milton Hays firm was one of the most prestigious in Illinois. Lincoln maintained offices next door and was a rising star in the new Republican Party. Hay recalled an early encounter with Lincoln:          Hay was not a supporter of Lincoln for president until after his nomination in 1860. Hay then made speeches and wrote newspaper articles boosting Lincolns candidacy. When Nicolay, who had been made Lincolns private secretary for the campaign, found he needed help with the huge amounts of correspondence, Hay worked full-time for Lincoln for six months.     After Lincoln was elected, Nicolay, who continued as Lincolns private secretary, recommended that Hay be hired to assist him at the White House. Lincoln is reported to have said, We cant take all Illinois with us down to Washington but then Well, let Hay come . Kushner and Sherrill were dubious about the story of Lincolns offhand appointment of Hay as fitting well into Hays self-image of never having been an office-seeker, but poorly into the realities of Springfield politics of the 1860s —Hay must have expected some reward for handling Lincolns correspondence for months. Hay biographer John Taliaferro suggests that Lincoln engaged Nicolay and Hay to assist him, rather than more seasoned men, both out of loyalty and surely because of the competence and compatibility that his two young aides had demonstrated .

Accordingly, Hay encouraged Reid to seek the State position, while firmly ruling himself out as a possible candidate for that post, and quietly seeking the inside track to be ambassador in London. Zeitz states that Hay aggressively lobbied for the position.     According to Taliaferro, only after the deed was accomplished and Hay was installed as the ambassador to the Court of St. Jamess would it be possible to detect just how subtly and completely he had finessed his ally and friend, Whitelaw Reid . A telegraph from Hay to McKinley in the latters papers, dated December 26 reveals the formers suggestion that McKinley tell Reid that the editors friends had insisted that Reid not endanger his health through office, especially in Londons smoggy climes. The following month, in a letter, Hay set forth his own case for the ambassadorship, and urged McKinley to act quickly, as suitable accommodations in London would be difficult to secure. Hay gained his object , and shifted his focus to appeasing Reid. Taliaferro states that Reid never blamed Hay, but Kushner and Sherrill recorded, Reid was certain that he had been wronged by Hay, and the announcement of Hays appointment nearly ended their 26-year friendship.     Reaction in Britain to Hays appointment was generally positive, with George Smalley of The Times writing to him, we want a man who is a true American yet not anti-English .

Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador, both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success, because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations.     An ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Britain was over the practice of pelagic sealing, that is, the capture of seals offshore of Alaska.

Meetings were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House, where he found his old office and bedroom each occupied by several clerks. Now responsible for 1,300 federal employees, he leaned heavily for administrative help on his old friend Alvey Adee, the second assistant.     By the time Hay took office, the war was effectively over and it had been decided to strip Spain of her overseas empire and transfer at least part of it to the United States. At the time of Hays swearing-in, McKinley was still undecided whether to take the Philippines, but in October finally decided to do so, and Hay sent instructions to Day and the other peace commissioners to insist on it.

Within those jurisdictions, the nation in possession often gave preference to its own citizens in trade or in developing infrastructure such as railroads. Although the United States did not claim any parts of China, a third of the China trade was carried in American ships, and having an outpost near there was a major factor in deciding to retain the former Spanish colony of the Philippines in the Treaty of Paris.     Hay had been concerned about the Far East since the 1870s. As Ambassador, he had attempted to forge a common policy with the British, but the United Kingdom was willing to undertake territorial acquisition in China to guard its interests there whereas McKinley was not. In March 1898, Hay warned that Russia, Germany, and France were seeking to exclude Britain and America from the China trade, but he was disregarded by Sherman, who accepted assurances from Russia and Germany.     McKinley was of the view that equality of opportunity for American trade in China was key to success there, rather than colonial acquisitions; that Hay shared these views was one reason for his appointment as Secretary of State.

Hay was in agreement, but feared Senate and popular opposition, and wanted to avoid Senate ratification of a treaty. Rockhill drafted the first Open Door note, calling for equality of commercial opportunity for foreigners in China.     Hay formally issued his Open Door note on September 6, 1899. This was not a treaty, and did not require the approval of the Senate. Most of the powers had at least some caveats, and negotiations continued through the remainder of the year. On March 20, 1900, Hay announced that all powers had agreed, and he was not contradicted.

As American troops were sent to China to relieve the nations legation, Hay sent a letter to foreign powers , stating while the United States wanted to see lives preserved and the guilty punished, it intended that China not be dismembered. Hay issued this on July 3, 1900, suspecting that the powers were quietly making private arrangements to divide up China. Communication between the foreign legations and the outside world had been cut off, and the personnel there were falsely presumed slaughtered, but Hay realized that Minister Wu could get a message in, and Hay was able to establish communication. Hay suggested to the Chinese government that it now cooperate for its own good.

It went through eight editions in Hays lifetime. The Spanish are depicted as afflicted by the triple curse of crown, crozier , and sabre —most kings and ecclesiastics are presented as useless—and Hay pins his hope in the republican movement in Spain. Gale deems Castilian Days a remarkable, if biased, book of essays about Spanish civilization .

Yet, when his steamboat catches fire, He saw his duty, a dead-sure thing,—/And went for it, ther and then.  Jim holds the burning steamboat against the riverbank until the last passenger gets ashore, at the cost of his life.

Hays poem offended some clergymen, but was widely reprinted and even included in anthologies of verse.     The Bread-Winners      The Bread-Winners, one of the first novels to take an anti-labor perspective, was published anonymously in 1883 and he may have tried to disguise his writing style. The book examines two conflicts: between capital and labor, and between the nouveau riche and old money. In writing it, Hay was influenced by the labor unrest of the 1870s, that affected him personally, as corporations belonging to Stone, his father-in-law, were among those struck, at a time when Hay had been left in charge in Stones absence. According to historian Scott Dalrymple, in response, Hay proceeded to write an indictment of organized labor so scathing, so vehement, that he dared not attach his name to it.      The major character is Arthur Farnham, a wealthy Civil War veteran, likely based on Hay. Farnham, who inherited money, is without much influence in municipal politics, as his ": null

The villain is Andrew Jackson Offitt , who leads the Bread-winners, a labor organization that begins a violent general strike. Peace is restored by a group of veterans led by Farnham, and, at the end, he appears likely to marry Alice Belding, a woman of his own class.     Although unusual among the many books inspired by the labor unrest of the late 1870s in taking the perspective of the wealthy, it was the most successful of them, and was a sensation, gaining many favorable reviews. It was also attacked as an anti-labor polemic with an upper-class bias. There were many guesses as to authorship, with the supposed authors ranging from Hays friend Henry Adams to New York Governor Grover Cleveland, and the speculation fueled sales.          Early in his presidency, Hay and Nicolay requested and received permission from Lincoln to write his biography. By 1872, Hay was convinced that we ought to be at work on our Lincoln. I dont think the time for publication has come, but the time for preparation is slipping away.  Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his fathers papers; by 1875, they were engaged in research. Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincolns papers, which were not opened to other researchers until 1947. They gathered documents written by others, as well as many of the Civil War books already being published. They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolays recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.     Hay began his part of the writing in 1876; the work was interrupted by illnesses of Hay, Nicolay, or family members, or by Hays writing of The Bread-Winners. By 1885, Hay had completed the chapters on Lincolns early life, and they were submitted to Robert Lincoln for approval. Sale of the serialization rights to  The Century  magazine, edited by Hays friend Richard Gilder, helped give the pair the impetus to bring what had become a massive project to an end.     The published work, Abraham Lincoln: A History, alternates parts in which Lincoln is at center with discussions of contextual matters, such as legislative events or battles. The first serial installment, published in November 1886, received positive reviews. When the ten-volume set emerged in 1890, it was not sold in bookstores, but instead door-to-door, then a common practice. Despite a price of $50, and the fact that a good part of the work had been serialized, five thousand copies were quickly sold. The books helped forge the modern view of Lincoln as great war leader, against competing narratives that gave more credit to subordinates such as Seward. According to historian Joshua Zeitz, it is easy to forget how widely underrated Lincoln the president and Lincoln the man were at the time of his death and how successful Hay and Nicolay were in elevating his place in the nations collective historical memory.           In 1902, Hay wrote that when he died, I shall not be much missed except by my wife.  Nevertheless, due to his premature death at age 66, he was survived by most of his friends. These included Adams, who although he blamed the pressures of Hays office, where he was badgered by Roosevelt and many senators, for the Secretary of States death, admitted that Hay had remained in the position because he feared being bored. He memorialized his friend in the final pages of his autobiographical  The Education of Henry Adams : with Hays death, his own education had ended.     Gale pointed out that Hay accomplished a great deal in the realm of international statesmanship, and the world may be a better place because of his efforts as secretary of state  ... the man was a scintillating ambassador . Yet, Gale felt, any assessment of Hay must include negatives as well, that after his marriage to the wealthy Clara Stone, Hay allowed his deep-seated love of ease triumph over his Middle Western devotion to work and a fair shake for all.  Despite his literary accomplishments, Hay was often lazy. His first poetry was his best.      Taliaferro suggests that if Hay put any  ... indelible stamp on history, perhaps it was that he demonstrated how the United States ought to comport itself. He, not Roosevelt, was the adult in charge when the nation and the State Department attained global maturity.  He quotes ": null

Hays efforts to shape Lincolns image increased his own prominence and reputation in making his association with the assassinated president ever more remarkable and noteworthy. According to Zeitz, the greater Lincoln grew in death, the greater they grew for having known him so well, and so intimately, in life.
