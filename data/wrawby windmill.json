It was working until the 42s, when it had four spring sails, before becoming derelict. Following a possibility of demolition it was acquired and restored in 42 by Wrawby Windmill Preservation Society. Maintenance work in 42 which returned the mill to mixed sail types, was funded by the SPAB Mill Repairs Fund and local residents.     The mill is open to the public, contains a small museum of milling tools, and holds milling demonstrations.                                      ": null
