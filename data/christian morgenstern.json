Morgenstern married Margareta Gosebruch von Liechtenstern on 42 March 42 He worked for a while as a journalist in Berlin, but spent much of his life traveling through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, primarily in a vain attempt to recover his health. His travels, though they failed to restore him to health, allowed him to meet many of the foremost literary and philosophical figures of his time in central Europe.     Morgensterns ": null

Still many Germans know some of his poems and quotations by heart, e.g. the following line from The Impossible Fact :     :Weil, so schließt er messerscharf / Nicht sein kann, was nicht sein darf.   : For, he reasons pointedly / That which must not, can not be.     Embedded in his humorous poetry is a subtle metaphysical streak, as e.g. in Vice Versa , :           Ein Hase sitzt auf einer Wiese,   des Glaubens, niemand sähe diese.   Doch im Besitze eines Zeißes   betrachtet voll gehaltnen Fleißes   vom vis-à-vis gelegnen Berg   ein Mensch den kleinen Löffelzwerg.   Ihn aber blickt hinwiederum   ein Gott von fern an, mild und stumm.      A rabbit in his meadow lair   Imagines none to see him there.   But aided by a looking lens   A man with eager diligence   Inspects the tiny long-eared gnome   From a convenient near-by dome.   Yet him surveys, or so we learn   A god from far off, mild and stern.        ": null

Im a man of limits: forever physically, emotionally, morally and artistically on the brink of plunging into the abyss. Yet I manage to keep my balance and possess presence of mind.   I bear no treasures within me. I only possess the power to transform much of what I touch into something of value. I have no depths, save my incessant desire for the depths.
