His oeuvre consists of short, poetic prose pieces that do not easily fit into usual formal categories. The inspiration for his trademark short prose he drew from the concise aesthetic of Charles Baudelaires prose poems and the spatial limitations of the Correspondenzkarte, the postcard, first launched and disseminated in his native Austria in 1869.      He became well known throughout Vienna after the publication of a book of his fragmentary observations of women and children in everyday street activities.

The piece caused an uproar, and the performance had to be halted: a complete performance of the work was not given until 1952.     Altenberg, like many writers and artists, was constantly short of money, but he was adept at making friends, cultivating patrons, and convincing others to pay for his meals, his champagne, even his rent, with which he was frequently late. He repaid his debts with his talent, his wit, and his charm. Many academics consider him to have been a bohemians bohemian.         Most of Altenbergs work is published in the German language and, outside of anthology pieces, is difficult to find. Much of it remains in university libraries or private collections.
