Many databases exist, covering various information types: for example, DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, phenotypes and biodiversity. Databases may contain empirical data , predicted data , or, most commonly, both. They may be specific to a particular organism, pathway or molecule of interest. Alternatively, they can incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases. These databases vary in their format, access mechanism, and whether they are public or not.     Some of the most commonly used databases are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, please check the link at the beginning of the subsection.     Used in biological sequence analysis: ": null
