The story, dealing with racism, marital strife and alcoholism, was unheard of in the escapist world of musical comedy. Despite his doubts, Ziegfeld spared no expense in staging the piece to give it its full epic grandeur.

He was pleasantly surprised when the next morning brought ecstatic reviews and long lines at the box office.
