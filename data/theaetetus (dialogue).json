When Socrates tells the child that he will later be smaller without losing an inch because Theaetetus will have grown relative to him, the child complains of dizziness . In an often quoted line, Socrates says with delight that wonder belongs to the philosopher . He admonishes the boy to be patient and bear with his questions, so that his hidden beliefs may be yanked out into the bright light of day.         When Socrates sums up what they have agreed on so far, it becomes problematic that knowledge is sense perception, for Socrates raises the question that When the same wind blows, one of us feels cold and the other not? As a result, he introduces the idea of Heraclitean flux to act as a defense to the wind objection. Heracliteanism shows that Nothing is in itself just one thing...Everything is in a process of coming to be . Thus as there is no fixed meaning in things, but they draw their meaning in a referential difference to other things, the wind objection can be incorporated into Theaetetuss claim that Knowledge is sense perception . As a result, they can then continue their inquiry as to the truth of this claim. It is important to note that the Heraclitean doctrine of Flux is not the same as the Protagorean doctrine. The Protagorean is radical truth relativism whereas the Heraclitean is radical reality relativism. It serves as a supporting theory to the Protagorean interpretation of Theaetetuss claim, in order that they might fully inquire as to the validity of this premise. Socrates admits that it is unfortunate that Protagoras is dead and cannot defend his idea against people such as himself. He says that the two of them are trampling on his orphan but the charge remains.         Since Protagoras is dead, Socrates puts himself in the sophists shoes and tries to do him the favor of defending his idea . Socrates concedes that if Protagoras were still alive, he would have more to say in his own defense, and that they are now essentially mistreating his orphan child. Putting words in the dead ": null

Socrates invites Theodorus to put up a more vigorous defense of Protagoras, as he does not want it suggested that he has used the childs timidity to aid him in his argument against the doctrine of Protagoras .

Are there other birds that represent this type of knowledge? Socrates comes to the conclusion that this is absurd and therefore he discards the aviary analogy.         After discarding the bird-cage analogy, Socrates and Theaetetus return to the definition of knowledge as true judgement . This, Theaetetus argues, is true because it is free from mistakes . However Socrates introduces an example of a jury in the law-courts, being persuaded of an opinion by a lawyer. This persuasion is not the same as knowing the truth, as all is produced is conviction in judging whatever the lawyers want . Although Theaetetus hopes it is possible the lawyer will be able to persuade the jury of the truth , Socrates is unsatisfied as if they are justly persuaded, they will have true knowledge. However, in Socrates belief, they cannot make a correct judgement as they would not have true knowledge . With this conflict, Socrates decides that true judgement and knowledge must be different things.       After distinguishing between knowledge and true judgement, Theaetetus recalls being told that true judgement with an account  equates to knowledge . Things without an account are unknowable, while things with an account are knowable.     Socrates responds by telling of a dream, in which he overheard people talking of primary elements . These primary elements can only be named, they cannot be thought of as existing or not - he gives examples of words like itself, or that, each, alone or this . While they can be added to other words, they by themselves are just a name. When these elements are added together, Socrates says that a complex is formed . The primary elements are unaccountable and unknowable, but perceivable while the complexes are knowable and expressible and so can be objects of true judgement . He concludes his dream by agreeing with Theaetetus that knowledge is true judgement with an account .     However, Socrates exposes some difficulties by examining letters. He takes the first two letters of his name, S and O to wonder if the syllable So is knowable while the individual letters are not . Theaetetus finds the idea strange, so Socrates deduces that in order to know the syllable, the letters must be known first . Socrates proposes that the syllable can be a single form produced from the letters. With this in mind, Socrates considers whether the sum and the whole are the same . Theaetetus initially says they are not, but changes his mind in confusion when Socrates leads him through maths and the different ways of expressing the number six . After agreeing this, Socrates returns to the subject of syllables and letters to conclude from Theaetetus answers that syllables are different from letters and cannot contain letters . Theaetetus admits this idea is ridiculous . Socrates returns to talking about elements and complexes to propose that they are in the same class, as they have no parts and a single form .     Socrates sums up this reversal by remarking that if anyone tries to tell them the complex is knowable and expressable while the element is the opposite, we had better not listen to him . He cites the example of a musician distinguishing individual notes to propose that elements are much more clearly known.     Socrates proposes an account to be making ones thought apparent vocally by means of words and verbal expressions . However, he wonders if that is so, everyone will be able to make judgement with an account as they can all vocalize and express opinions on matters . Socrates examines it further by suggesting that a man who can vocalize his judgement must be able to make reference to the primary elements of the subject . Giving an example of defining a wagon by its individual parts , agreement is reached that an account is going through a thing element by element. Socrates questions Theaetetus by drawing on his learning of how to write, and the idea that if you misplace individual elements of a name, that does not mean you have knowledge of it . This finishes Socrates second definition of an account as the way to the whole through the elements . The third definition Socrates offers is being able to tell some mark by which the object you are asked about differs from all other things , giving the example that the Sun is distinct for its brightness. However, this definition of an account fails as by getting to know the differentness of an object, you have to acquire knowledge about it. Thus the answer to the initial question What is knowledge would be heavily circuitous - correct judgement accompanied by knowledge of the differentness, which Socrates admits is silly .
