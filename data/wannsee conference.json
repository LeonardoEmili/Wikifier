It would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by the highest offices of the Party and State . Such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation.

Eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining the purpose of the meeting and the intentions of the regime moving forward. He stated at his trial that it was personally edited by Heydrich, and thus reflected the message he intended the participants to take away from the meeting. Copies of the minutes  were sent by Eichmann to all the participants after the meeting.

According to Longerich, a primary goal of the meeting was to emphasise that once the deportations had been completed, the implementation of the final solution became an internal matter of the SS, totally outside the purview of any other agency. A secondary goal was to determine the scope of the deportations and arrive at definitions of who was Jewish, who was Mischling, and who should be spared. The representatives of the ministerial bureaucracy had made it plain that they had no concerns about the principle of deportation per se. This was indeed the crucial result of the meeting and the main reason why Heydrich had detailed minutes prepared and widely circulated , said Longerich. Their presence at the meeting also ensured that all those present were accomplices and accessories to the murders that were about to be undertaken.     Eichmanns biographer ": null

The simplest, most decisive way that Heydrich could ensure the smooth flow of deportations , he writes, was by asserting his total control over the fate of the Jews in the Reich and the east, and cow other interested parties into toeing the line of the RSHA .
