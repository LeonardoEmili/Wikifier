However, appeal is merely a privilege provided by statute in 47 states and in federal judicial proceedings; the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that there is no federal constitutional right to an appeal. Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 270 n.5 ; M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 110 .     Since a few states lack intermediate appellate courts, the state supreme court may operate under mandatory review , in which it must hear all appeals from the trial courts. This was the case, for example, in Nevada . Such judicial systems are usually very congested. Valerie Miller, Judges renew their call for appeals court, Las Vegas Business Press 19, no. 3 : 1.     Most state supreme courts have implemented discretionary review, like their federal counterpart. Under such a system, intermediate appellate courts are entrusted with deciding the vast majority of appeals. Intermediate appellate courts generally focus on the mundane task of what appellate specialists call error correction, G. Alan Tarr, Judicial Process and Judicial Policymaking, 6th ed. , 37 and 139. which means their primary task is to decide whether the record reflects that the trial court correctly applied existing law.

These cases usually pertain to issues which different appellate courts within its jurisdiction have decided differently, or highly controversial cases involving a completely new legal issue never seen in that state. In other words, once the state supreme court is able to offload the tedious burden of error correction to intermediate courts, it can then focus on the long-term task of developing a coherent body of case law for the people of its state.

The result is that there is no first appeal of right for the vast majority of civil and criminal cases in that state. Appellants are still free to petition for review, of course, but such petitions are subject to severe length constraints and necessarily are more narrowly targeted than a long opening appellate brief to an intermediate appellate court . In turn, the vast majority of decisions of Virginia circuit courts in civil and criminal cases are thereby insulated from appellate review on the merits.     New Hampshire and West Virginia formerly also provided only discretionary review for nearly all cases, even though they had no intermediate appellate court. Both states gradually recognized that even if this arrangement did not offend the federal Constitution, it was unduly harsh for hapless appellants, and transitioned to mandatory review, respectively, in 2004  and 2010.

For example, in 2007 the Court reviewed 244 cases appealed from federal courts and only 22 from state courts.
