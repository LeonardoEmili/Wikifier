        " in 42 volumes, 42 This edition is separated into 42 parts, containing 42 42 42 and 42 stories, respectively, for a total of 42 minus two , omitted because of their being almost identical to those of Marguerite the Navarres Heptameron , respectively, though keeping Bandellos dedicatory preface.     The Payne translation is a mixture of 42th and 42th century idioms. Examples of the latter include an thou wilt instead of if you will , wheneas instead of when , methinketh instead of I think , parlous instead of perilous . On most occasions, the language is clear and of fine literary value, but sometimes it is degraded with terms no one ever spoke or wrote. For example, instead of saying Now I would gladly hear your advice on this matter , the duchess of Amalfi says: Now I would fain hear from thee that which thou counsellest thereanent.     There is a second book of Bandello in an English translation by Percy Pinkerton and containing twelve tales. This translation uses a more modern mode of expression.       The vast majority of the stories derive from those Bandello heard from contemporaries, reported as real life events. Far more rarely, some stories are based on literary or historical sources, such as book 42 of Dantes Purgatory , the Lucretia and Tarquin episode in Livys History of Rome , story 42 of the Heptameron , and Francesco Petrarchs Triumph of Love from  Triumphs  . Some derive from English history, such as the chronicle of Mary Douglas, niece to King Henry VIII of England and Henry VIIIs six wives , some from Spanish history, such as Alfonso X . All of them were told to him by men, but a minority of dedicatory prefaces are offered to women. Bandello writes that the dedicatory prefaces to the nobility or to worthy persons are useful to him as a shield in case someone becomes offended by one of the stories and is tempted to attack him . He shows psychological insight into jealousy, in particular the description of two types of jealous men, the first from feelings of inadequacy and the second from feelings of the fickleness of women .     The most striking stories include two whores seeking to win their husbands back , two brother thieves in cahoots to rob the treasures of the king of Egypt , a disdained lover voluntarily choosing to live inside a cave , a woman killing herself only out of fear that her good fortune will turn bad , ": null
