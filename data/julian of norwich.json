The popular image of Julian living with her cat for company stems from the regulations set out in The Ancrene Riwle.     As an anchoress living in the heart of an urban environment, Julian would not have led an entirely secluded life. She would have been permitted to make clothes for the poor, and she enjoyed the financial support of the more prosperous members of the local community, as well as the general affection of the population. She would have in turn provided prayers, advice and counsel to the people, serving as an example of devout holiness.

Julian emphasized this by explaining how the bond between mother and child is the only earthly relationship that comes close to the relationship a person can have with Jesus. She used metaphors when writing about Jesus in relation to ideas about conceiving, giving birth, weaning and upbringing.        She wrote, For I saw no wrath except on mans side, and He forgives that in us, for wrath is nothing else but a perversity and an opposition to peace and to love.  She wrote that God sees us as perfect and waits for the day when human souls mature so that evil and sin will no longer hinder us. God is nearer to us than our own soul, she wrote. This theme is repeated throughout her work: Jesus answered with these words, saying: All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well. ... This was said so tenderly, without blame of any kind toward me or anybody else .     Monastic and university authorities might not have challenged her theology because of her status as an anchoress.
