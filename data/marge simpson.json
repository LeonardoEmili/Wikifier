The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly in the middle of the sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth.

Part of Kavners contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marges voice in public because she believes it destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people.  Kavner takes recording sessions seriously and feels that voice acting is a little more limiting than live acting. And I have nothing to do with my characters movement.      Marges raspy voice is only slightly different from Kavners, who has a honeyed gravel voice  which she says is due to a bump on vocal cords.  While Marge is her most famous character, Kavners favorite characters to voice are Patty and Selma because theyre really funny and sad at the same time.  In  The Simpsons Movie , some scenes, such as Marges video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted.      Until 1998, Kavner was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode.  The issue was resolved a month later,  and Kavner earned $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode.  Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Kavner and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.
