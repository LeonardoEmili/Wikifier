A shorter version of the opening title was used later in the series, in syndication, and on Disney Channel reruns. Dodd also wrote many other songs used in individual segments throughout the series.       Each day of the week had a special show theme, which was reflected in the several segments. The themes were:   Monday  – Fun with Music Day   Tuesday  – Guest Star Day   Wednesday  – Anything Can Happen Day   Thursday  – Circus Day   Friday  – Talent Round-up Day       The series ran on ABC Television for an hour each weekday in the 1955–1956 and 1956–1957 seasons , and only a half-hour weekdays in 1957–1958, the final season to feature new programming.  Although the show returned for the 1958–1959 season , these programs were repeats from the first two seasons, recut into a half-hour format. The Mickey Mouse Club was featured on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Walt Disneys Adventure Time, featuring reruns of The Mickey Mouse Club serials and several re-edited segments from  Disneyland  and  Walt Disney Presents , appeared on Tuesdays and Thursdays.       Although the show remained popular, ABC decided to cancel the show after its fourth season, as Disney and the ABC network could not come to terms for renewal. The cancellation in September 1959 was attributed to several factors: the Disney studios did not realize high-profit margins from merchandise sales, the sponsors were uninterested in educational programming for children, and many commercials were needed to pay for the show. After canceling The Mickey Mouse Club, ABC also refused to let Disney air the show on another network.  Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against ABC, and won the damages in a settlement; however, he had to agree that both the Mickey Mouse Club and  Zorro  could not be aired on any major network.

The prohibition against major American broadcast network play of the original Mickey Mouse Club became disputed when Disney acquired ABC in 1996. Although it would not air on ABC again, Disney would run it on the Disney Channels Vault Disney block 1998-2002.       Although the series had been ended in the United States, many members of the cast assembled for highly successful tours of Australia in 1959 and 1960. The television series was very successful in Australia and was still running on Australian television. The cast surprised Australian audiences, as by then they had physically matured and in some cases, bore little resemblance to the young cast with whom Australians were so familiar. Mainstream television did not reach Australia until 1956, so the series screened well into the 1960s when the back catalog expired.       In response to continuing audience demand, the original Mickey Mouse Club went into edited syndicated half-hour reruns that enjoyed wide distribution starting in the fall of 1962, achieving strong ratings especially during its first three seasons in syndicated release. Some new features were added such as Fun with Science or Professor Wonderful  and Marvelous Marvin in the 1964–1965 season; Jimmie Dodd appeared in several of these new segments before his death in November 1964. Many markets stretched the program back to an hours daily run time during the 1960s rerun cycle by adding locally produced and hosted portions involving educational subjects and live audience participation of local children, in a manner not unlike  Romper Room .

        "; she was not selected.      Former Mouseketeers Annette Funicello and serial star Tim Considine guest-starred in one episode; Former Mouseketeers Darlene Gillespie and Cubby OBrien were also reunited on another episode.       The lyrics of the Mickey Mouse Club March theme song were slightly different from the original, with two additional lines: Hes our favorite Mouseketeer; we know you will agree and Take some fun and mix in love, our happy recipe.     A soundtrack album Disneyland Records DQ-2501 was released with the show.     A new rendition of the Mickey Mouse Club March was made later on in 1999 by Mannheim Steamroller, a contemporary band, in hopes of connecting new-age children and their parents who watched the Mickey Mouse Club.       This incarnation was not distributed by Disney only; while Disney did produce the series, it was co-produced and distributed by SFM Entertainment , which also handled 1970s-era syndication of the original 1950s series.     The All-New Mickey Mouse ClubThe Mickey Mouse Club began airing on The Disney Channel with the channels 1983 launch. While the show was popular with younger audiences, the Disney Channel executives felt it had become dated over the years, particularly as it was aired in black-and-white. Their answer was to create a brand-new version of the club, one aimed toward contemporary audiences. Notably, the all-new club-members would wear Mouseketeer varsity jackets without the iconic Mickey Mouse ears. This show was called The All-New Mickey Mouse Club .     This version of the series is notable for featuring a number of cast members who went on to global success in music and acting, including Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , Justin Timberlake , JC Chasez , Keri Russell , Ryan Gosling , Deedee Magno , Rhona Bennett , Nikki DeLoach , and Chase Hampton .     Throughout the run, Fred Newman was the main adult co-host from the beginning of the series until season 6. In the first season, Newman was joined by other co-host Mowava Pryor. She was then replaced by Terri Eoff from the fourth season until the sixth season. By the shows final season, two original members Chase Hampton and Tiffini Hale became the co-hosts.     This was the first version of the club to have any studio audience, though a fairly small group.     Former Mouseketeer Don Grady guest-starred in the shows first season finale. Grady, along with fellow Mouseketeers Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode, during the shows third season. Funicello later appeared on the show again, in an interview with the Mouseketeer Lindsey Alley .       From the first through fifth seasons, the series aired Monday through Friday at 5:30 pm. Through season 6, the show aired Monday to Thursday. In its final season, it aired Thursdays only at 7:00 pm . The series premiered Monday, April 24, 1989, ended production in October 1994, and aired its last original episode in 1996. Seasons 3 and 5 had the most episodes . Seasons 4 and 6 were shorter, having about 35 episodes each. The remaining seasons were a standard 45 episodes each.       The show was known for its sketch comedy. Some of the sketches played off well-known movies, musicals, and even cartoons, as well as holiday-related skits. During the final season, some of the skits showed everyday occurrences experienced by teens, often teaching viewers a lesson on how to handle real-life situations.       The series featured music videos of the Mouseketeers singing their versions of popular songs in front of a live studio audience or the Walt Disney World Resort . This became one of the most popular segments.       A unique feature of the show was the Mouseketeers performing concerts on different days . During the final season, the concerts were replaced primarily by live performances that featured singing and dancing in front of the audience.       This version maintained the theme day format from the previous two versions. When Disney decided to revamp the show for its final season, the show was reduced to a single weekly airing, shown only on Thursdays. Although still produced as a daily series during the final season taping in 1994, The Disney Channel, after canceling the series once season 7 production had ended, decided to air the final season in a weekly format, therefore stretching the first-run episodes into early 1996. The final season premiered in May 1995, almost a year after production had started and more than 6 months after the series finale was taped.     Theme days were:   Music Day  – Mondays , Tuesdays   Guest Day  – Tuesdays , Mondays   Anything Can Happen Day  – Wednesdays   Party Day  – Thursdays , Fridays   Hall of Fame Day  – Fridays , Thursdays , Wednesdays       The adult co-hosts for the show were Fred Newman , Mowava Pryor , Terri Misner Eoff ": null
