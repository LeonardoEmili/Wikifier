Each part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with ‑o; adjectives with ‑a; present‑tense indicative verbs with ‑as, and so on.     It is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 meaning words , though more exist in the language.

With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix ‑o indicates an abstraction: parolo from the verbal root paroli ; belo from the adjectival root bela ; whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix ‑a: reĝa , from the nominal root reĝo ; parola . The various verbal endings mean to be __ when added to an adjectival root: beli ; and with a nominal root they mean to act as the noun, to use the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: reĝi .

        ": parole ; vide ; reĝe .     The meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, brosi is based on a nominal root , whereas kombi is based on a verbal root . Change the suffix to -o, and the similar meanings of brosi and kombi diverge: broso is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas kombo is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal kombi to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix -ilo is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: kombilo . On the other hand, changing the nominal root broso to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, brosi . For the name of the action, the suffix -ado will change a derived verb back to a noun: brosado . Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root requires the suffix -eco, as in infaneco , but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal -o: belo . Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as beleco are acceptable and widely used.     A limited number of basic adverbs do not end with -e, but with an undefined part-of-speech ending -aŭ. Not all words ending in -aŭ are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in -aŭ have other functions, such as hodiaŭ today or ankoraŭ yet, still About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as nun now , tro too, too much , not counting the adverbs among the ": null

Compare the nominative phases lia domo and ties domo with the plural liaj domoj and ties domoj , and with the accusative genitive lian domon and ties domon. An unofficial but widely recognized accusative preposition na has become popular with some Esperantists on the internet and may be used in such situations, especially when there is no following noun .

It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:   :la kato ĉasis la muson en la domo    :la kato ĉasis la muson en la domon .     The accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:   :li iris al sia hejmo   :li iris hejmen     Both por and pro often translate English for. However, they distinguish for a goal  and for a cause : To vote por your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote pro your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.

In such use unu is irregular in that it doesnt take the accusative affix -n in the singular, but does in the plural:   :ian unu ideon   : some particular idea ,   but   :unuj objektoj venis en unujn manojn, aliaj en aliajn manojn   : some objects came into certain hands, others into other hands .   Additionally, when counting off, the final u of unu may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:   :Un! Du! Tri! Kvar!       At numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots miliono and miliardo are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A  billion  in most English-speaking countries is different from a billion in most other countries . The international root biliono is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix -iliono to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix -iliardo:  at Reta Vortaro     :10 6 : miliono   :10 9 : miliardo    :10 12 : duiliono   :10 15 : duiliardo    :10 18 : triiliono   :10 21 : triiliardo    :etc.     Note that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: mil homojn but milionon da homoj .       Numerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added . Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix -a, quantities with the nominal suffix -o, multiples with -obl-, fractions with ‑on‑, collectives with ‑op‑, and repetitions with the root ‑foj‑.     :sescent sepdek kvin   :tria    :trie   :dudeko   :duobla   :kvarono   :duope   :dufoje     The particle po is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group.

Compare: Sergio Pokrovskij , in Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo     :Pasintjare mi feriis en Italujo   ::Last year I vacationed in Italy   :En Italujo mi feriis pasintjare   ::I vacationed in Italy last year   :En Italujo pasintjare mi feriis   ::In Italy last year I went on vacation   :En Italujo pasintjare feriis mi   ::       Within a noun phrase, either the order adjective–noun or noun–adjective may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with numeral–noun and demonstrative–noun being the norm, as in English.   :blua ĉielo a blue sky   :tiu ĉielo that sky   :tiu blua ĉielo that blue sky   :sep bluaj ĉieloj seven blue heavens     Adjective–noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective–noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:   :homo malgrandanima kaj ege avara a petty and extremely greedy person   :vizaĝo plena de cikatroj a face full of scars   :ideo fantazia sed tamen interesa a fantastic but still interesting idea     Adjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:   :okazis io stranga something strange happened   :ne ĉio brilanta estas diamanto not everything shiny is a diamond   Changing the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative nenio nothing:   :li manĝis nenion etan he ate nothing little   :li manĝis etan nenion he ate a little nothing     With multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun–numeral–:   :miaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj my two great friends.

Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs. This is parallel to the rather archaic distinction in English between who and whom. Other sequences of case are possible, though with different readings: fuĝis la hundo, kiu ĉasis ĝin the dog which chased it fled; mi vidis la katon, kiun la hundo ĉasis I saw the cat, which the dog chased. However, they do agree in number:   :fuĝis la katoj, kiujn ĝi ĉasis the cats which it chased fled     Other word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:   :fuĝis la kato, kiun ĉasis ĝi the cat which it chased fled   :vidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon ĉasis I saw the dog which chased the cat       ": null

However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as cat, cats and walk, walked do in English.  Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their weak inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as pli, plej, plu , tre, tro , and in the verbal morphemes ‑as, ‑anta, ‑ata; ‑is, ‑inta, ‑ita; ‑os, ‑onta, ‑ota; and ‑us.     Other features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the -o suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo‑European languages such as Russian. For example, Russian neuter and feminine nouns end in singular -o and -a, adjectives in -oje and -aja, adverbs in -o and -e, etc.; cf. also Provençal la fenestro , which is identical to Esperanto la fenestro. More pertinent is the accusative plural in -jn. Esperanto is superficially similar to the non‑Indo‑European ": null
