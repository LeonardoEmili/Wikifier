Jennifer is disgusted by her fathers actions and runs away, telling Julio that she will be reunited with him in a years time . Cherry and her Fandango girls arrive . Julio learns his claim is running dry which means he has to move on to make a living and that he will not be there to greet Jennifer when she returns.     ;Act II   A year later in October, the miners celebrate the high times in Rumson now that the Fandango girls are around . Edgar Crocker, a miner who has saved his money, falls for Elizabeth and she responds, although Ben does not notice since he thinks Raymond Janney is in love with her . Another miner, Mike Mooney, tells Julio about a lake that has gold dust on the bottom and he considers looking for it . Jennifer returns in December, having learned civilized ways back East . Ben tells his daughter that he will soon be moving on since he was not meant to stay in one place for long . The next day as Cherry and the girls are packing to leave they tell her about Julio leaving to find the lake with a bottom of gold. Raymond Janney offers to buy Elizabeth from Ben for $3,000, but she runs off with Edgar Crocker.     Word comes of another strike 40 miles south of Rumson and the rest of the town packs up to leave except for Jennifer, who is waiting for Julio to return, and Ben, who suddenly realizes that Rumson is indeed his town.
