The information shown follows sources in cross-referenced articles; where sources differ, provisos have been clearly indicated. These territories and regions are subject to various additional categorisations, depending on the source and purpose of each description.                  Saione, the church of the King, a [[Free Wesleyan Church of Ton in Kolomotuʻa , Tonga . Due to missionary efforts undertaken by various organizations, particularly British and American societies, diverse Protestant denominations like Methodist , Congregationalist , Baptist , Anglican , Adventist , Pentecostal , Presbyterian or United Protestant churches were introduced throughout Oceania.|thumb   The predominant religion in Oceania is Christianity . A 2011 survey found that 92% in Melanesia , 93% in Micronesia and 96% in Polynesia described themselves as Christians . Traditional religions are often animist , and prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in spirits  representing natural forces. In the 2013 census, 48% of New Zealanders affiliated themselves with Christianity and 42% declared no religion. In the 2016 Census, 52% of the Australian population declared some variety of Christianity and 30% stated no religion .     In recent Australian and New Zealand censuses, large proportions of the population say they belong to no religion . In Tonga , everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Christian faith. The Ahmadiyya mosque in Marshall Islands is the only mosque in Micronesia. Another one in Tuvalu belongs to the same sect. The Baháí House of Worship in Tiapapata, Samoa , is one of seven designations administered in the Baháí Faith .     Other religions in the region include Islam , Buddhism and Hinduism , which are prominent minority religion s in Australia and New Zealand. Judaism , Sikhism and Jainism are also present. Sir Isaac Isaacs was the first Australian born Governor General of Australia and was the first Jewish vice-regal representative in the British Empire . Prince Philip Movement is followed around Yaohnanen village on the southern island of Tanna in Vanuatu .         Native languages of Oceania fall into three major geographic groups:   The large Austronesian language family , with such languages as Malay , and Polynesian languages such as Maori and Hawaiian   The Aboriginal Australian languages , including the large Pama–Nyungan family   The Papuan languages of New Guinea and neighbouring islands, including the large Trans–New Guinea family     Colonial languages include English in Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and many other territories; French in New Caledonia and French Polynesia , Japanese in the Bonin Islands , Spanish on Galápagos Islands and Easter Island . There are also Creoles formed from the interaction of Malay or the colonial languages with indigenous languages, such as Tok Pisin , Bislama , Chavacano , various Malay trade and creole languages , Hawaiian Pidgin , Norfuk , and Pitkern . Contact between Austronesian and Papuan resulted in several instances in mixed languages such as Maisin .     Immigrants brought their own languages to the region, such as Mandarin , Italian, Arabic, Polish, Hindi, German, Spanish, Korean, Cantonese and Greek , among others, namely in Australia and New Zealand, or Fiji Hindi in Fiji .         thu immigrants arriving in Australia   The most multicultural areas in Oceania, which have a high degree of immigration , are Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. Since 1945, more than 7 million people have settled in Australia. From the late 1970s, there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries, making Australia a multicultural country .     Sydney is the most multicultural city in Oceania, having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40 percent of residents speaking a language other than English at home. Furthermore, 36 percent of the population reported having been born overseas , with top countries being Italy, Lebanon, Vietnam and Iraq, among others. Melbourne is also fairly multicultural, having the largest Greek-speaking population outside of Europe, and the second largest Asian population in Australia after Sydney.     European migration to New Zealand provided a major influx following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Subsequent immigration has been chiefly from the British Isles, but also from continental Europe, the Pacific, The Americas and Asia. Auckland is home to over half of New Zealands overseas born population, including 72 percent of the countrys Pacific Island-born population, 64 percent of its Asian -born population, and 56 percent of its Middle Eastern and African born population.   thu immigrants in Hawaii were Azorean or Madeira n.   Hawaii is a majority-minority state . Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789. In 1820, the first American missionaries arrived to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways. , a large proportion of Hawaiis population have Asian ancestry  – especially Filipino , Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Many are descendants of immigrants brought to work on the sugarcane plantations in the mid-to-late 19th century. Almost 13,000 Portuguese immigrants had arrived by 1899; they also worked on the sugarcane plantations. Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began in 1899 when Puerto Ricos sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes, causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from Hawaii.     Between 2001 and 2007 Australias Pacific Solution policy transferred asylum seekers to several Pacific nations, including the Nauru detention centre . Australia, New Zealand and other nations took part in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands between 2003 and 2017 after a request for aid.       Archaeology , linguistics , and existing genetic studies indicate that Oceania was settled by two major waves of migration.
