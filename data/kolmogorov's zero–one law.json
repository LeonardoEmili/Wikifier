In an infinite sequence of coin-tosses, a sequence of 42 consecutive heads occurring infinitely many times is a tail event.     Tail events are precisely those events whose occurrence can still be determined if an arbitrarily large but finite initial segment of the X_i are removed.     In many situations, it can be easy to apply Kolmogorovs zero–one law to show that some event has probability 42 or 42 but surprisingly hard to determine which of these two extreme values is the correct one.
