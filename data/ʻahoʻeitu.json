These other sons, who were also living in the sky, were at that moment playing sika-ulu-toa, a dart-throwing game with reeds having heads made of toa wood. When those young men found out that the good-looking boy was their half-brother, they grew envious. They tore Ahoeitu to pieces, cooked him and ate him, tossing his head into some hoi plants which have become poisonous ever since.     Some time after, Eitumātupua sent a woman to fetch Ahoeitu, but she returned with the message that the boy was not to be found. The god demanded his other sons to come, and he forced them to vomit into a large wooden bowl by tickling their throats. Noticing the boys head missing, Eitumātupua sent a messenger to find the head and also the bones. Everything was put in the bowl, and water was poured on it as were the leaves of the  nonufiafia , which is a known medicinal plant, able to revive people who were near death. The bowl then was put behind the house, and inspected from time to time until Ahoeitu as found sitting up in it.     They all were brought into Eitumātupuas house, and the god spoke angrily to his elder sons, saying that they were murderers. He punished them by confining them to the sky, while Ahoeitu was made to descend to earth and become king of Tonga. The wicked half-brothers repented, and begged their father that they also be allowed to follow Ahoeitu to earth.
