There may be regulations prohibiting this vociferous practice, but if the radio dealers have anything to say it about it, it will never have the slightest effect along Radio Row. ...

One shop said it was practically able to stay in business just by making repairs on the electric meters burned out by the students of the city schools who were studying radio, and all were optimistic about growing public interest in two new kinds of radio: FM and television.
