The book features many low-budget obscurities and exploitation films such as  Rat Pfink a Boo Boo ,  Attack of the 50 Foot Woman , and the apparently lost  Him . Other categories include expensive, big studio failures like  The Swarm  and popular films such as  Jesus Christ Superstar .     In the introduction the authors admit that we know our choices will not please everyone & mdash;least of all the actors, producers, writers and directors who are honored in the pages that follow. We further recognize that the number of bad films is so enormous and the competition for the very worst is so intense, that all decisions reached here are subject to considerable second-guessing. Nevertheless, we have researched the subject thoroughly & mdash;sitting through more than 2,000 wretched films in the last few years & mdash;and we believe that our nominees and award winners can stand the test of time.

The fake film was Dog of Norway featuring Muki the Wonder Hound . This film was illustrated using a photo of a co-authors dog. The giveaway was that the same dog was in the photo of the authors in the back of the book. Another film in the book, the now-lost 1974 porn film  Him , has also been cited as the hoax, though it is known to have existed.      No formal clarification of the hoax film was provided by the subsequent release, The Hollywood Hall of Shame. That book again features the same dog pictured with the authors .
