The camera would also be used to allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecrafts instrument panel in flight.  Television cameras were carried aboard all crewed Apollo missions.

In a spacecraft review meeting held with Shea on August 19, 1966 , the crew expressed concern about the amount of flammable material  in the cabin, which both astronauts and technicians found convenient for holding tools and equipment in place. Although Shea gave the spacecraft a passing grade, after the meeting they gave him a crew portrait they had posed with heads bowed and hands clasped in prayer, with the inscription:      Shea gave his staff orders to tell North American to remove the flammables from the cabin, but did not supervise the issue personally.      North American shipped spacecraft CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966, under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to be completed at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery.  Grissom became so frustrated with the inability of the training simulator engineers to keep up with the spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house  and hung it on the simulator.     The command and service modules were mated in the KSC altitude chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first uncrewed, then with both the prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the environmental control unit in the command module was found to have a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in service module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the service module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.        In December, the second Block I flight AS-205 was canceled as unnecessary; and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for Apollo1. McDivitts crew was now promoted to prime crew of the Block II / LM mission, re-designated AS-258 because the AS-205 launch vehicle would be used in place of AS-207.

Grissom immediately noticed a strange odor in the air circulating through his suit which he compared to sour buttermilk , and the simulated countdown was put on hold at 1:20  pm, while air samples were taken. No cause of the odor could be found, and the countdown was resumed at 2:42  pm. The accident investigation found this odor not to be related to the fire.     Three minutes after the count was resumed, the hatch installation was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, which was part of the spacecrafts heat shield; and an outer hatch cover, which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire command module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch, and from launch escape rocket exhaust in the event of a launch abort. The boost hatch cover was partially, but not fully, latched in place because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at ,  higher than atmospheric pressure.           Movement by the astronauts was detected by the spacecrafts ": null

The simulated countdown was put on hold again at 5:40  pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20  pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.            The crew members were using the time to run through their checklist again, when a momentary increase in AC Bus2 voltage occurred. Nine seconds later , one of the astronauts exclaimed Hey! , Fire! ,  or Flame! ;  this was followed by two seconds of scuffling sounds through Grissoms open microphone. This was immediately followed at 6:31:06.2 by someone saying, got a fire in the cockpit. After 6.8 seconds of silence a second, badly garbled transmission was heard by various listeners as:   Theyre fighting a bad fire—Lets get out... Open er up ,   Weve got a bad fire—Lets get out... Were burning up , or   Im reporting a bad fire... Im getting out...   The transmission lasted 5.0 seconds and ended with a cry of pain.      Some blockhouse witnesses said that they saw White on the television monitors, reaching for the inner hatch release handle as flames in the cabin spread from left to right.      The intensity of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the command modules inner wall at 6:31:19 . Flames and gases then rushed outside the command module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crews attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the command module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the command module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.     As the pressure was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began when most of the oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.      It took five minutes for the pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed it out of the way to one side. Although the cabin lights remained lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissoms and Whites nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. Whites restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.     Deke Slayton was possibly the first NASA official to examine the spacecraft interior.  His testimony contradicted the official report concerning the position of Grissoms body. Slayton said of Grissom and Whites bodies, It is very difficult for me to determine the exact relationships of these two bodies. They were sort of jumbled together, and I couldnt really tell which head even belonged to which body at that point. I guess the only thing that was real obvious is that both bodies were at the lower edge of the hatch. They were not in the seats. They were almost completely clear of the seat areas.
