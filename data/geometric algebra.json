It is standard to denote these respectively by juxtaposition and the symbol \\wedge . The above definition of the geometric algebra is abstract, so we summarize the properties of the geometric product by the following set of axioms. The geometric product has the following properties, for A, B, C\\in \\mathcal :   : AB \\in \\mathcal    : 42AA42A , where 42 is the identity element    : AC    : AAB+AC and ABA+CA    : a^42 g42 , where a is any element of the subspace V of the algebra.     The exterior product has the same properties, except that the last property above is replaced by a \\wedge a 42 for a \\in V .     Note that in the last property above, the real number g need not be nonnegative if g is not positive-definite. An important property of the geometric product is the existence of elements having a multiplicative inverse. For a vector a , if a^42 \\ne 42 then a^ exists and is equal to g^a . A nonzero element of the algebra does not necessarily have a multiplicative inverse. For example, if u is a vector in V such that u^42 42 , the element \\textstyle\\frac is both a nontrivial ": null
