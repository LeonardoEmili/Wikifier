Improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity, rather than pre-planning a response.

Speaking or acting in front of an audience is a stressful situation, which causes an increased heart rate.       In a 2017 study on American university students, actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated heart rates throughout their performances; this agrees with previous studies on professional and amateur actors heart rates.  While all actors experienced stress, causing elevated heart rate, the more experienced actors displayed less heart rate variability than the less experienced actors in the same play. The more experienced actors experienced less stress while performing, and therefore had a smaller degree of variability than the less experienced, more stressed actors. The more experienced an actor is, the more stable their heart rate will be while performing, but will still experience elevated heart rates.          The ": null

Actors and actresses need to make a resume  when they go to auditions, similarly to when people of other occupations go into an interview. The acting resume is very different from the normal resume, it has a lot less information on it with lists, instead of paragraphs and it should have the head shot  on the back.     Auditioning is the act of performing either a monologue  or sides  the casting director either mails or emails to the actors right before their audition. Auditioning entails showing the skills the actors have to instantly turn into a completely different person within a two-minute frame period. For theater auditions it can be longer than two minutes or they can perform more than one monologue, each casting director can have different requirements for actors. For auditions, actors will have to go dressed similarly to the character they are auditioning for to make it easier for the casting director to visualize them as the character. For television or film they will have to undergo more than one audition, if the casting director chooses to put them forward into the process. Oftentimes actors are called into another audition last minute and will send them the sides either the morning of or the night before. Auditioning can be part of the stressful side to acting, especially if one is not trained to audition.       ": null

Some actors continue to rehearse a scene throughout the run of a show in order to keep the scene fresh in their minds and exciting for the audience.       A critical audience with evaluative spectators is known to induce stress on actors during performance,  and an actor will typically rate the quality of their performance higher than their spectators. Heart rates are generally always higher during a performance with an audience when compared to rehearsal, however whats interesting is that this audience also seems to induce a higher quality of performance. Simply put, while public performances cause extremely high stress levels in actors , the stress actually improves the performance, supporting the idea of positive stress in challenging situations        Depending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary.

Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is due to the fact that a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actors career. After the show a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity can be seen.
