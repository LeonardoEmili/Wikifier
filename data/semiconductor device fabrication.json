Currently, electronic dye marking is possible if wafer test data is logged into a central computer database and chips are binned according to the predetermined test limits. The resulting binning data can be graphed, or logged, on a wafer map to trace manufacturing defects and mark bad chips. This map can also be used during wafer assembly and packaging.     Chips are also tested again after packaging, as the bond wires may be missing, or analog performance may be altered by the package. This is referred to as the final test .     Usually, the fab charges for testing time, with prices in the order of cents per second. Testing times vary from a few milliseconds to a couple of seconds, and the test software is optimized for reduced testing time.
