His request was refused as there was a standing arrangement that any advance to one band member had to be paid to all the others. After a meeting on 17 August during which Barnes quit the band it was decided that the group would split up. A farewell concert series, The Last Stand, was planned and a final studio album,  Twentieth Century  , was recorded. Prestwich returned for that tour, which began in October. Before the last four scheduled shows in Sydney, Barnes lost his voice and those dates were postponed to mid-December.      The bands final performances were at the Sydney Entertainment Centre from 12 to 15 December 1983 – ten  years since their first live appearance as Cold Chisel in Adelaide – the group then disbanded. The Sydney shows formed the basis of a concert film,  The Last Stand  , which became the biggest-selling cinema-released concert documentary by an Australian band to that time. Other recordings from the tour were used on a live album,  The Barking Spiders Live: 1983  , the title is a reference to the pseudonym the group occasionally used when playing warm-up shows before tours. Some were also used as b-sides for a three-CD singles package, Three Big XXX Hits, issued ahead of the release of their 1994 compilation album,  Teenage Love .

Walker formed Catfish in 1988, ostensibly a solo band with a variable membership, which included Moss, Charlie Owen and Dave Blight at times.

Throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s, Cold Chisel were courted to re-form but refused, at one point reportedly turning down a $5  million offer to play a sole show in each of the major Australian state capitals. Moss and Walker often collaborated on projects, neither worked with Barnes until Walker wrote, Stone Cold , for the singers sixth studio album,  Heat  . The pair recorded an acoustic version for Flesh and Wood . Thanks primarily to continued radio airplay and Barnes solo success, Cold Chisels legacy remained solidly intact. By the early 1990s the group had surpassed 3 million album sales, most sold since 1983. The 1991 compilation album,  Chisel , was re-issued and re-packaged several times, once with the long-deleted 1978 EP as a bonus disc and a second time in 2001 as a double album. The Last Stand soundtrack album was finally released in 1992. In 1994 a complete album of previously unreleased demo and rare live recordings,  Teenage Love , was released, which provided three singles.       Cold Chisel reunited in October 1997, with the line-up of Barnes, Moss, Prestwich, Small and Walker.

Barnes voice sounds worn, wonderful and better than ever.       McFarlane described Cold Chisels early career in his  Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop  , after ten years on the road, called it a day. Not that the band split up for want of success; by that stage had built up a reputation previously uncharted in Australian rock history. By virtue of the profound effect the bands music had on the many thousands of fans who witnessed its awesome power, Cold Chisel remains one of Australias best-loved groups. As one of the best live bands of its day, fused a combination of rockabilly, hard rock and rough-house soulnblues that was defiantly Australian in outlook.  The Canberra Times  Luis Feliu, in July 1978, observed how, This is not just another Australian rock band, no mediocrity here, and their honest, hard-working approach looks like paying off. While the range of styles tackled and done convincingly, from hard rock to blues, boogie, rhythm and blues, is where the appeal lies.     Influences from blues and early rock n roll was broadly apparent, fostered by the love of those styles by Moss, Barnes and Walker. Small and Prestwich contributed strong pop sensibilities.
