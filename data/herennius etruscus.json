After the news of his death reached Decius, Decius refused to be consoled, stating that the loss of one life was minor to a battle, and thus continued the combat, in which he was also slain. Decius death is similarly obscure, although it is agreed upon that he must have died either during the battle, as a commilito, during the retreat from the battle, or else was slain while serving as imperator. After the death of both Decius and Herennius Etruscus, and much of the Roman army with them, the remaining forces immediately elected Trebonianus Gallus, the governor of Moesia, as emperor. Trebonianus Gallus made peace with Cniva on humiliating terms, allowing them to keep their prisoners and spoils in order to secure peace. In order to gain popular support, Trebonianus Gallus retained Herennia Etruscilla as  augusta  , and elevated Hostilian to augustus, making him co-emperor alongside Trebonianus Gallus himself.
