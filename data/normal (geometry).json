Specifically, given a 42x42 transformation matrix M, we can determine the matrix W that transforms a vector n perpendicular to the tangent plane t into a vector n & prime; perpendicular to the transformed tangent plane M t, by the following logic:     Write n & prime; as W n.

Therefore, one should use the inverse transpose of the linear transformation when transforming surface normals.
