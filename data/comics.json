R.C. Harvey defined comics as pictorial narratives or expositions in which words usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa . Each definition has had its detractors. Harvey saw McClouds definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, and objected to McClouds de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content . Aaron Meskin saw McClouds theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.
