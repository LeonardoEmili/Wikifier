When digital computers became available, being general-purpose programmable devices, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes. However these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature, cleanliness, and power quality. To meet these challenges the PLC was developed with several key attributes. It would tolerate the shop-floor environment, it would support discrete input and output in an easily extensible manner, it would not require years of training to use, and it would permit its operation to be monitored. Since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times, modern electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers, and performance could be traded off for reliability.

Struger in 1958-60 at the Allen-Bradley company in Milwaukee, WI, USA. A programmable logic controller, or PLC, is a simple electronic device that allows precise numerical control of machinery. It is widely used to control everything from washing machines to roller coaster to automated manufacturing equipment. Struger is credited with creating the PLC acronym. Allen-Bradley , the manufacturer of the controller, became a major programmable logic controller device manufacturer in the United States during the tenure of Struger.      Early PLCs were designed to replace relay logic systems. Relay systems were large and bulky and had an assortment of issues. The hard-wired nature made it difficult for design engineers to alter the process. Even small changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. If even one wire were out of place, or one relay failed, the whole system would become faulty.

These techniques emphasize logical organization of operations.     While the fundamental concepts of PLC programming are common to all manufacturers, differences in I/O addressing, memory organization, and instruction sets mean that PLC programs are never perfectly interchangeable between different makers.

        " which shows the control system. A ladder diagram is a method of drawing control circuits which pre-dates PLCs. The ladder diagram resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays.     As an example, say a facility needs to store water in a tank. The water is drawn from the tank by another system, as needed, and our example system must manage the water level in the tank by controlling the valve that refills the tank. Shown are:     Two inputs represented by contacts of the float switches   An output to the fill valve, labelled as the fill valve which it controls   An internal contact, representing the output signal to the fill valve which is created in the program.   A logical control scheme created by the interconnection of these items in software     In ladder diagram, the contact symbols represent the state of bits in processor memory, which corresponds to the state of physical inputs to the system. If a discrete input is energized, the memory bit is a 1, and a normally open contact controlled by that bit will pass a logic true signal on to the next element of the ladder. Therefore, the contacts in the PLC program that read or look at the physical switch contacts in this case must be opposite or open in order to return a TRUE for the closed physical switches. Internal status bits, corresponding to the state of discrete outputs, are also available to the program.     In the example, the physical state of the float switch contacts must be considered when choosing normally open or normally closed symbols in the ladder diagram. The PLC has two discrete inputs from ": null

    {
        "es . Both float switches open their contacts when the water level in the tank is above the physical location of the switch.     When the water level is below both switches, the float switch physical contacts are both closed, and a true value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal Fill Valve contact latches the circuit so that even when the Low Level contact opens , the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as the water level remains between the two switch levels. Once the water level rises enough so that the High Level switch is off , the PLC will shut the inlet to stop the water from overflowing; this is an example of seal-in logic. The output is sealed in until a high level condition breaks the circuit. After that the fill valve remains off until the level drops so low that the Low Level switch is activated, and the process repeats again.       | |   | Low Level High Level Fill Valve |   |------ -----|------ ------------------------------|   | | |   | | |   | | |   | Fill Valve | |   |------ -----| |   | |   | |       A complete program may contain thousands of rungs, evaluated in sequence. Typically the PLC processor will alternately scan all its inputs and update outputs, then evaluate the ladder logic; input changes during a program scan will not be effective until the next I/O update. A complete program scan may take only a few milliseconds, much faster than changes in the controlled process.     Programmable controllers vary in their capabilities for a rung of a ladder diagram. Some only allow a single output bit. There are typically limits to the number of series contacts in line, and the number of branches that can be used. Each element of the rung is evaluated sequentially. If elements change their state during evaluation of a rung, hard-to-diagnose faults can be generated, although sometimes the technique is useful. Some implementations forced evaluation from left-to-right as displayed and did not allow reverse flow of a logic signal to affect the output.

        "s. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.         The most basic function of a programmable controller is to emulate the functions of electro-mechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of examine if on instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electro-mechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a rung of a ladder diagram , and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic. Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one rung of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an internal coil with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs. Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.     Some PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic. This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which in a sufficiently complex circuit may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts. The elimination of these sneak paths is either a bug or a feature, depending on programming style.     More advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variable internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.         The main function of a timer is to keep an output on for a specific length of time. A good example of this is a garage light, where you want power to be cut off after 2 minutes so as to give someone time to go into the house. The three different types of timers that are commonly used are a Delay-OFF, a Delay-ON, and a Delay-ON-Retentive. A Delay-OFF timer activates immediately when turned on, counts down from a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is off. A Delay-ON timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, counts up to a programmed time before cutting off, and is cleared when the enabling input is turned off. A Delay-ON-Retentive timer is activated by input and starts accumulating time, retains the accumulated value even if the rung goes false, and can be reset only by a RESET contact.     Counters are primarily used for counting items such as cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use counters in PLCs to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck. There are three types of counters, Up counters, Down counters, and Up/Down counters. Up counters count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset. Down counters count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down counters count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset. Yanik, P. . Timers and Counters. Cullowhee, NC, United States of America.

At the start of each execution loop, the status of all physical inputs are copied to an area of memory, sometimes called the I/O Image Table , which is accessible to the processor. The program then runs from its first instruction rung down to the last rung. It takes some time for the processor of the PLC to evaluate all the rungs and update the I/O image table with the status of outputs. Maher, Michael J. Real-Time Control and Communications. 18th Annual ESD/SMI International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1989, p. 431-436. Scan times of a few milliseconds may be encountered for small programs and fast processors, but for older processors and very large programs much longer scan times may be encountered. Excessively long scan times may mean the response of the PLC to changing inputs or process conditions is too slow to be useful.     As PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented. Kinner, Russell H., P.E. Designing Programmable Controller Application Programs Using More than One Designer. 14th Annual International Programmable Controllers Conference Proceedings, 1985, p. 97-110. This enhanced programming could be used to save scan time for high-speed processes; for example, parts of the program used only for setting up the machine could be segregated from those parts required to operate at higher speed. Newer PLCs now have the option to run the logic program synchronously with the IO scanning. This means that IO is updated in the background and the logic reads and writes values as required during the logic scanning.     Special-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with ": null

        "s, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution on the PLC.         There are 5 main steps in a scan cycle:   Reading inputs   Executing the program   Processing communication requests   Executing CPU diagnostics   Writing outputs       A small PLC will have a fixed number of connections built in for inputs and outputs. Typically, expansions are available if the base model has insufficient I/O.     Modular PLCs have a chassis into which are placed modules with different functions. The processor and selection of I/O modules are customized for the particular application. Several racks can be administered by a single processor, and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants. Options are also available to mount I/O points directly to the machine and utilize quick disconnecting cables to sensors and valves, saving time for wiring and replacing components.

In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software such as PLCLogix can save time in the design of automated control applications and can also increase the level of safety associated with equipment since many what if scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.        Some special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted down time. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system which is fault-tolerant and capable of handling the process with faulty modules. In such cases to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to hardware configuration for preventing total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure.

PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a generic solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.

However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.
