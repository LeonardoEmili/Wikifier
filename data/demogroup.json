Demosceners specialize themselves into various categories to be able to take part in the demomaking process. A few people are able to cross over between multiple archetypes , but this is by no means a trend.       The coder is the demogroups programmer who creates the demos software framework and is responsible for the actual realtime state of the demo. While some coders specialize in developing system-level functionality , others code effects which are usually visual representations of mathematical formulas, such as ": null

        ".     In the 42s, coders were most often entirely responsible for the demos flow and arrangement, including the effects synchronization to the music and sometimes even the design. Nowadays, software tools known as demotools are widely used, allowing this work to be done by a designer who does not have to be a coder. Many groups, however, still prefer that the coder takes most of the responsibility in the demomaking process, including the design.     In many cases, an attempt for excelling in several areas has resulted in one area outshadowing the others: for instance, coders who try to make music often come up with coder music which may be technically passable but lacks artistic ambitions. Coder graphics and coder palettes are similar terms for graphics and color schemes.       Graphic artists  create the visual coherency behind a demo, which include still pictures, design elements, fonts, colors, 42D objects, textures and animation.     Originally, there was a single type of graphician creating typical 42D graphics . Ever since demos started using complex 42D graphics, graphicians that exclusively model 42D graphics are also around, sometimes referred to as modelers.       Musicians are responsible for the composing, arranging, mixing and mastering the soundtracks and sound effects in the demo.     In the older days, musicians worked with ": null

This type of masquerading is often just performed to confuse na√Øve newcomers to the scene; while some fake identities are never revealed for their time of activity, in most cases a large portion of unrelated people are aware of the real persons behind the spoof.       Though they are not strictly demogroups by definition, the scene always had various individuals who excelled in all areas of demomaking; rather than gathering various other persons to aid them in a creative process, they do all of the programming, music making and visual art themselves. While the obvious disadvantage of this type of working is the multiple of amount of work one must do with a given quality standard, one-man groups usually point out that having no others to work with gets rid of discussions and creative differences alike, and is actually a very free way of working.     One-man groups are usually treated with a mix of respect and curiosity within the scene, because theyre not an extremely common phenomenon, and some of the scene marks them as an unnecessary effort for virtuosity, largely because it is virtually impossible to perform above average in all areas - one-man demos and intros usually bear obvious lacks in given areas, depending on whether the creator was more a coder, graphician or musician, who adapted other skillsets later.
