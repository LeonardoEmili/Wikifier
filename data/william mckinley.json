However, the young, enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessors death. The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations. Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded; by 42 according to Gould, McKinleys administration was deemed no more than a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelts . Beginning in the 42s, McKinley received more favorable evaluations; nevertheless, in surveys ranking American presidents, he has generally been placed near the middle, often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland. Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinleys presidency profoundly affected the nations future, he more followed public opinion than led it, and that McKinleys standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency.     There has been broad agreement among historians that McKinleys election was at the time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the ": null

Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 42 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it. Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 42 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 42th and early 42th centuries.     Phillips writes that McKinleys low rating is undeserved, and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinleys success at building an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinleys legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death.

Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinleys actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinleys actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.
