This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I —a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells. They were named natural killer because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing self. For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells. It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of missing self . Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens. Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.
