Effects units are available in a variety of formats or form factors. Stompboxes are primarily used units in live performance and studio recordings. Rackmount devices saw a heavy usage during the later 20th century, due to their advanced processing power and desirable tones. However, by the 21st century, with the advent of digital Plug-Ins and more powerful Stompboxes for live usage, the need and practicality of rackmounted effects units went down, and as such, prices of rack effects have diminished due to lower usage.

A multi-effects device is a single electronics effects pedal or rackmount device that contains many different electronic effects. Multi-FX devices allow users to preset combinations of different effects, allowing musicians quick on-stage access to different effects combinations. Hunter, Dave . . Hal Leonard. p. 125. Multi-effects units typically have a range of distortion, chorus, flanger, phaser and reverb effects. The most expensive multi-effects units may also have looper functions. Pedal-style multieffects range from fairly inexpensive stompboxes that contain two pedals and a few knobs to control the effects to large, expensive floor units with many pedals and knobs. Rackmounted multieffects units are typically mounted in a rack. Guitarists and bassists may mount their rackmounted multieffects unit in the same rack with their preamplifier and power amplifier.
