She drew a division between what she termed Operative Witchcraft , which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose, and Ritual Witchcraft , by which she meant the ancient religion of Western Europe , a fertility-based faith that she also termed the Dianic cult . She claimed that the cult had very probably once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a Mother Goddess but that at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female . In her argument, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches god, manifest and incarnate , to whom the witches offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches Sabbaths.     Members joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called admission ceremonies ; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptised into the faith. At the same time, she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines. Murray described the religion as being divided into ": null

According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book, with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors.     Describing this witch-cult as a joyous religion , she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter. She asserted that the General Meeting of all members of the religion were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats. The Esbats, Murray claimed, were nocturnal rites that began at midnight, and were primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious . At the former, magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends. She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches paying homage to the deity, renewing their vows of fidelity and obedience to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they had conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted, ceremonies and fertility rites took place, and then the Sabbath ended with feasting and dancing.        Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be a fertility cult , she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood; the sacrifice of animals; the sacrifice of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers; and the sacrifice of the witches god by fire to ensure fertility.   She interpreted accounts of witches shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred. She asserted that accounts of ": null

Murray asserted that a pre-Christian fertility-based religion had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community . She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarfs, who continued to live on the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two. In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that ": null

Rose suggested that the reason that Murrays theory gained such support was partly because of her imposing credentials as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers.

Murrays theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials, and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her factual errors and methodological failings . Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced during the 1920s and 1930s were largely critical. George L. Burr reviewed both of her initial books on the witch-cult for the  American Historical Review . He stated that she was not acquainted with the careful general histories by modern scholars and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts. W. R. Halliday was highly critical in his review for Folklore, as was E. M. Loeb in his review for  American Anthropologist .     Soon after, one of the foremost specialists of the trial records, LEstrange Ewen, brought out a series of books which rejected Murrays interpretation.   Rose suggested that Murrays books on the witch-cult contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning . He accepted that her case could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it . Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murrays claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as a view grounded on ignorance alone .     Murray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting out of their own Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.

Hutton stated that Murray had treated her source material with reckless abandon , in that she had taken vivid details of alleged witch practices from sources scattered across a great extent of space and time and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves.

Several historians and folklorists have pointed out that Ginzburgs arguments are very different to Murrays: whereas Murray argued for the existence of a pre-Christian witches cult whose members physically met during the witches Sabbaths, Ginzburg argued that some of the European visionary traditions that were conflated with witchcraft in the Early Modern period had their origins in pre-Christian fertility religions. Moreover, other historians have expressed criticism of Ginzburgs interpretation of the benandanti; Cohn stated that there was nothing whatsoever in the source material to justify the idea that the benandanti were the survival of an age-old fertility cult . Echoing these views, Hutton commented that Ginzburgs claim that the benandanti visionary traditions were a survival from pre-Christian practices was an idea resting on imperfect material and conceptual foundations . He added that Ginzburgs assumption that what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies dating to pagan times , was entirely an inference of his own and not one supported by the documentary evidence.            On researching the history of UCLs Egyptology department, the historian Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students.

Hutton noted that Murray was one of the earliest women to make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship , and the archaeologist Niall Finneran described her as one of the greatest characters of post-war British archaeology . Upon her death, Daniel referred to her as the Grand Old Woman of Egyptology , with Hutton noting that Egyptology represented the core of her academic career . In 2014, Thornton referred to her as one of Britains most famous Egyptologists . However, according to the archaeologist Ruth Whitehouse, Murrays contributions to archaeology and Egyptology were often overlooked as her work was overshadowed by that of Petrie, to the extent that she was often thought of primarily as one of Petries assistants rather than as a scholar in her own right. By her retirement she had come to be highly regarded within the discipline, although, according to Whitehouse, Murrays reputation declined following her death, something that Whitehouse attributed to the rejection of her witch-cult theory and the general erasure of women archaeologists from the disciplines male-dominated history.          In his obituary for Murray in Folklore, James noted that her death was an event of unusual interest and importance in the annals of the Folk-Lore Society in particular as well as in the wider sphere in which her influence was felt in so many directions and   disciplines . However, later academic folklorists, such as Simpson and Wood, have cited Murray and her witch-cult theory as an embarrassment to their field, and to the Folklore Society specifically. Simpson suggested that Murrays position as President of the Society was a causal factor in the mistrustful attitude that many historians held toward folkloristics as an academic discipline, as they erroneously came to believe that all folklorists endorsed Murrays ideas. Similarly, Catherine Noble stated that Murray caused considerable damage to the study of witchcraft .     In 1935, UCL introduced the Margaret Murray Prize, awarded to the student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology; it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century.

Wiccas theological structure, revolving around a Horned God and Mother Goddess, was adopted from Murrays ideas about the ancient witch-cult, and Wiccan groups were named covens and their meetings termed esbats, both words that Murray had popularised.

Others insisted that the historical origins of the religion did not matter and that instead Wicca was legitimated by the spiritual experiences it gave to its participants. In response, Hutton authored  The Triumph of the Moon , a historical study exploring Wiccas early development; on publication in 1999 the book exerted a strong impact on the British Pagan community, further eroding belief in the Murrayite theory among Wiccans.
