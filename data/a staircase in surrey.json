In the first novel of the sequence, The Gaudy, Patullo returns to his Oxford College, after a long absence , and encounters a number of old friends, including Albert Talbert, his former tutor in English Literature; Lord Marchpayne, formerly Tony Mumford ; fellow Scot and schoolmate Ranald McKechnie, now Regius Professor of Greek at the college ; Cyril Bedworth ; and Robert Damien .     The second novel, Young Patullo, tells the story of their former relationships and Patullos undergraduate career. In A Memorial Service Patullo is instrumental in resolving the crisis caused by the academic insufficiency and aggressively anti-institutional behaviour of Ivo Mumford, his friend Tonys son, and begins a tentative involvement with his cousin Fiona Petrie, a don at one of the womens Colleges, as well as rekindling a friendship with Janet McKechnie. The title refers obliquely to the character of Paul Lusby, who committed suicide in the first novel as a result of a foolish wager proposed by Ivo Mumford, and whose brother Peter is seeking admission to the College, partly in memory of his brother. In The Madonna of the Astrolabe Patullo has to cope with his ex-wife and her sexual designs on current undergraduates, the undergraduates production of  Tamburlaine , and the problems of raising enough money for the urgently needed restoration of the crumbling Great Tower .
