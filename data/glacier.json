        ".             Glaciers erode terrain through two principal processes:  abrasion  and  plucking .     As glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften and lift blocks of rock into the ice. This process, called plucking, is caused by subglacial water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This expansion causes the ice to act as a lever that loosens the rock by lifting it. Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glaciers load. If a retreating glacier gains enough debris, it may become a rock glacier , like the Timpanogos Glacier in Utah.     Abrasion occurs when the ice and its load of rock fragments slide over bedrock and function as sandpaper, smoothing and polishing the bedrock below. The pulverized rock this process produces is called rock flour and is made up of rock grains between 0.002 and 0.00625  mm in size. Abrasion leads to steeper valley walls and mountain slopes in alpine settings, which can cause avalanches and rock slides, which add even more material to the glacier.     Glacial abrasion is commonly characterized by glacial striation s. Glaciers produce these when they contain large boulders that carve long scratches in the bedrock. By mapping the direction of the striations, researchers can determine the direction of the glaciers movement. Similar to striations are chatter mark s, lines of crescent-shape depressions in the rock underlying a glacier. They are formed by abrasion when boulders in the glacier are repeatedly caught and released as they are dragged along the bedrock.     The rate of glacier erosion varies. Six factors control erosion rate:   Velocity of glacial movement   Thickness of the ice   Shape, abundance and hardness of rock fragments contained in the ice at the bottom of the glacier   Relative ease of erosion of the surface under the glacier   Thermal conditions at the glacier base   Permeability and water pressure at the glacier base   When the bedrock has frequent fractures on the surface, glacial erosion rates tend to increase as plucking is the main erosive force on the surface; when the bedrock has wide gaps between sporadic fractures, however, abrasion tends to be the dominant erosive form and glacial erosion rates become slow.     Glaciers in lower latitudes tend to be much more erosive than glaciers in higher latitudes, because they have more meltwater reaching the glacial base and facilitate sediment production and transport under the same moving speed and amount of ice.     Material that becomes incorporated in a glacier is typically carried as far as the zone of ablation before being deposited. Glacial deposits are of two distinct types:   Glacial till: material directly deposited from glacial ice. Till includes a mixture of undifferentiated material ranging from clay size to boulders, the usual composition of a moraine.   Fluvial and outwash sediments: sediments deposited by water. These deposits are stratified by size.     Larger pieces of rock that are encrusted in till or deposited on the surface are called glacial erratic s . They range in size from pebbles to boulders, but as they are often moved great distances, they may be drastically different from the material upon which they are found. Patterns of glacial erratics hint at past glacial motions.       thu , Alberta , Canada   Glacial moraine s are formed by the deposition of material from a glacier and are exposed after the glacier has retreated. They usually appear as linear mounds of till , a non-sorted mixture of rock, gravel and boulders within a matrix of a fine powdery material. Terminal or end moraines are formed at the foot or terminal end of a glacier. Lateral moraines are formed on the sides of the glacier. Medial moraines are formed when two different glaciers merge and the lateral moraines of each coalesce to form a moraine in the middle of the combined glacier. Less apparent are ground moraine s, also called glacial drift, which often blankets the surface underneath the glacier downslope from the equilibrium line.     The term moraine is of French origin. It was coined by peasants to describe alluvial embankments and rims found near the margins of glaciers in the French Alps . In modern geology, the term is used more broadly, and is applied to a series of formations, all of which are composed of till. Moraines can also create moraine dammed lakes.       fra   Drumlin s are asymmetrical, canoe shaped hills made mainly of till. Their heights vary from 15 to 50  meters and they can reach a kilometer in length. The steepest side of the hill faces the direction from which the ice advanced , while a longer slope is left in the ices direction of movement .     Drumlins are found in groups called ": null

        "  or drumlin camps. One of these fields is found east of Rochester, New York ; it is estimated to contain about 10,000 drumlins.     Although the process that forms drumlins is not fully understood, their shape implies that they are products of the plastic deformation zone of ancient glaciers. It is believed that many drumlins were formed when glaciers advanced over and altered the deposits of earlier glaciers.       rig     Before glaciation, mountain valleys have a characteristic V shape , produced by eroding water. During glaciation, these valleys are often widened, deepened and smoothed to form a U -shaped glacial valley or glacial trough, as it is sometimes called. Glacial Landforms: Trough The erosion that creates glacial valleys truncates any spurs of rock or earth that may have earlier extended across the valley, creating broadly triangular-shaped cliffs called truncated spurs . Within glacial valleys, depressions created by plucking and abrasion can be filled by lakes, called paternoster lake s. If a glacial valley runs into a large body of water, it forms a fjord .     Typically glaciers deepen their valleys more than their smaller tributaries . Therefore, when glaciers recede, the valleys of the tributary glaciers remain above the main glaciers depression and are called hanging valley s.     At the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque , which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley. Cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier. Two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge, called an arête is left. This structure may result in a mountain pass . If multiple cirques encircle a single mountain, they create pointed pyramidal peak s; particularly steep examples are called horns .       Passage of glacial ice over an area of bedrock may cause the rock to be sculpted into a knoll called a ": null

Glaciers & Glaciation Douglas Benn and David Evans, pp324-326 Roches moutonnées have a gentle slope on their up-glacier sides and a steep to vertical face on their down-glacier sides. The glacier abrades the smooth slope on the upstream side as it flows along, but tears rock fragments loose and carries them away from the downstream side via plucking .       As the water that rises from the ablation zone moves away from the glacier, it carries fine eroded sediments with it. As the speed of the water decreases, so does its capacity to carry objects in suspension. The water thus gradually deposits the sediment as it runs, creating an alluvial plain . When this phenomenon occurs in a valley, it is called a valley train. When the deposition is in an estuary , the sediments are known as bay mud .     Outwash plains and valley trains are usually accompanied by basins known as kettles . These are small lakes formed when large ice blocks that are trapped in alluvium melt and produce water-filled depressions. Kettle diameters range from 5  m to 13  km, with depths of up to 45  meters. Most are circular in shape because the blocks of ice that formed them were rounded as they melted.       thu   When a glaciers size shrinks below a critical point, its flow stops and it becomes stationary. Meanwhile, meltwater within and beneath the ice leaves stratified alluvial deposits. These deposits, in the forms of columns, terraces and clusters, remain after the glacier melts and are known as glacial deposits .

They remain after the ice melts, with heights exceeding 100  meters and lengths of as long as 100  km.       Very fine glacial sediments or rock flour is often picked up by wind blowing over the bare surface and may be deposited great distances from the original fluvial deposition site. These eolian loess deposits may be very deep, even hundreds of meters, as in areas of China and the Midwestern United States of America. Katabatic wind s can be important in this process.         rig   Large masses, such as ice sheets or glaciers, can depress the crust of the Earth into the mantle. The depression usually totals a third of the ice sheet or glaciers thickness. After the ice sheet or glacier melts, the mantle begins to flow back to its original position, pushing the crust back up. This post-glacial rebound , which proceeds very slowly after the melting of the ice sheet or glacier, is currently occurring in measurable amounts in Scandinavia and the Great Lakes region of North America.
