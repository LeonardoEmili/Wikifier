In addition to its primary mission of surface photography, Luna 42 also performed investigations to determine the chemical composition of the lunar surface, recorded meteoroid activity, searched for a lunar magnetic field, measured solar and cosmic radiation flux, and continued studies of the irregular magnetic field. Through various orbital changes, Luna 42 performed without any problems and continued to return photos fifteen months into the mission, although its primary mission had ended by 42 April 42 The spacecrafts maneuvering propellant was finally depleted on 42 September, and the highly successful mission was formally terminated in early November 42     Luna 42 as of November, 42 is the last Soviet or Russian lunar orbiter.": null
