An important aspect of a lawyers job is developing and managing relationships with clients . The client-lawyer relationship is explained in six steps. First, the relationship begins with an intake interview where the lawyer gets to know the client personally. Second step is discovering the facts of the clients case. Thirdly is clarifying what the client wants to accomplish. The fourth step is where the lawyer shapes the clients expectations as to what actually can be accomplished. The second to last step, begins to develop various claims or defenses for the client. Lastly, the lawyer explains her or his fees to the client. Paul J. Zwier & Anthony J. Bocchini, Fact Investigation: A Practical Guide to Interviewing, Counseling, and Case Theory Development , 13–44. John H. Freeman, Client Management for Solicitors , 266–274.

Abel, Civil Law World, 10; Johnsen, 70; Olgiati, 339; and Rokumoto, 161. Even in civil law countries like Norway which have partially self-regulating professions, the Ministry of Justice is the sole issuer of licenses, and makes its own independent re-evaluation of a lawyers fitness to practice after a lawyer has been expelled from the Advocates Association. Brazil is an unusual exception in that its national Order of Advocates has become a fully self-regulating institution and has successfully resisted government attempts to place it under the control of the Ministry of Labor.

This article rebuts the common complaint of too many lawyers in the U.S. by pointing out that it is virtually impossible for a plaintiff to prevail in the vast majority of countries with less lawyers, like Japan, because there are simply not enough lawyers or judges to go around. Even wrongful death cases with clear evidence of fault can drag on for decades in Japan. Thus, any reduction in the number of lawyers would result in reduced enforcement of individual rights. ": null

Additionally, lawyers are twice as likely to suffer from addiction to alcohol and other drugs.

Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another.

Roman judges and governors would routinely consult with an advisory panel of jurisconsults before rendering a decision, and advocates and ordinary people also went to jurisconsults for legal opinions.
