The radon equilibrium factor  is the ratio between the activity of all short-period radon progenies , and the activity that would be at equilibrium with the radon parent.     If a closed volume is constantly supplied with radon, the concentration of short-lived isotopes will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the rate of decay of each decay product will equal that of the radon itself. The equilibrium factor is 1 when both activities are equal, meaning that the decay products have stayed close to the radon parent long enough for the equilibrium to be reached, within a couple of hours. Under these conditions, each additional pCi/L of radon will increase exposure by 0.01   working level  . These conditions are not always met; in many homes, the equilibrium factor is typically 40%; that is, there will be 0.004  WL of daughters for each pCi/L of radon in the air. 210 Pb takes much longer to come in equilibrium with radon, but, if the environment permits accumulation of dust over extended periods of time, 210 Pb and its decay products may contribute to overall radiation levels as well.

Rowman & Littlefield, 1998, pp. 36–39. .     The presence of radon in indoor air was documented as early as 1950. Beginning in the 1970s, research was initiated to address sources of indoor radon, determinants of concentration, health effects, and mitigation approaches. In the US, the problem of indoor radon received widespread publicity and intensified investigation after a widely publicized incident in 1984. During routine monitoring at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant, a worker was found to be contaminated with radioactivity. A high concentration of radon in his home was subsequently identified as responsible.                    All discussions of radon concentrations in the environment refer to 222 Rn. While the average rate of production of 220 Rn is about the same as that of 222 Rn, the amount of 220 Rn in the environment is much less than that of 222 Rn because of the short half-life of 220 Rn .

The radon activity of the entire Earths atmosphere originates from only a few tens of grams of radon, consistently replaced by decay of larger amounts of radium, thorium, and uranium.             Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium-226, which is found in uranium ores, phosphate rock, shales, igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, gneiss, and schist, and to a lesser degree, in common rocks such as limestone. Every square mile of surface soil, to a depth of 6  inches , contains approximately 1  gram of radium, which releases radon in small amounts to the atmosphere. On a global scale, it is estimated that 2.4 billion curies of radon are released from soil annually. Harley, J. H. in      Radon concentration can differ widely from place to place. In the open air, it ranges from 1 to 100  Bq/m 3 , even less above the ocean. In caves or ventilated mines, or poorly ventilated houses, its concentration climbs to 20–2,000  Bq/m 3 .
