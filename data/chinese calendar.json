If there is a leap month after the eleventh or twelfth month, then Chinese New Year falls on the third new moon after the December solstice. Alternatively, Chinese New Year will fall on the new moon that is closest to lì chūn, or the solar term that begins spring . However, this rule is not as reliable since it can be difficult to determine which new moon is the closest in the case of an early or late Chinese New Year.     It has been found that Chinese New Year moves back by either 10, 11, or 12 days in some years. If it falls before January 21, then it moves forward in the next year by either 18, 19, or 20 days.
