However, though the dead might live again, they could also die again. Draugar die a second death as Chester Gould calls it, when their bodies decay, are burned, dismembered or otherwise destroyed.      Draugar live in their graves, often guarding treasure buried with them in their burial mound. They are animated corpses with a corporeal body, unlike ghosts, with similar physical abilities as in life. Older literature makes clear distinctions between sea-draugar and land-draugar.       Draugar possess superhuman strength, can increase their size at will, and carry the unmistakable stench of decay. According to Gregg Smith, The appearance of a draugr was that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at. They are undead figures from Norse and Icelandic mythology which appear to retain some semblance of intelligence. They exist to guard their treasure, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who wronged them in life. The draugrs ability to increase its size also increased its weight, and the body of the draugr was described as being extremely heavy. Thorolf of ": null

Magnussen and Palsson, Laxdaela Saga, p. 103     In folklore, draugar slay their victims through various methods including crushing them with their enlarged forms, devouring their flesh, devouring them whole in their enlarged forms, indirectly killing them by driving them mad, and by drinking their blood. Animals feeding near the grave of a draugr might be driven mad by the creatures influence.  They may also die from being driven mad. Thorolf, for example, caused birds to drop dead when they flew over his bowl barrow.     The draugrs victims were not limited to trespassers in its home. The roaming undead devastated livestock by running the animals to death either by riding them or pursuing them in some hideous, half-flayed form. Shepherds duties kept them outdoors at night, and they were particular targets for the hunger and hatred of the undead:        Draugar are noted for having numerous magical abilities  resembling those of living witches and wizards, such as shape-shifting, controlling the weather, and seeing into the future.

The draugr could also move magically through the earth, swimming through solid stone as does Killer-Hrapp:          Some draugar are immune to weapons, and only a hero has the strength and courage needed to stand up to so formidable an opponent. In legends, the hero would often have to wrestle the draugr back to his grave, thereby defeating him, since weapons would do no good. A good example of this is found in  Hrómundar saga Gripssonar . Iron could injure a draugr, as is the case with many supernatural creatures, although it would not be sufficient to stop it. Simpson, Icelandic Folktales and Legends, p. 107. Sometimes the hero is required to dispose of the body in unconventional ways. The preferred method is to cut off the draugrs head, burn the body, and dump the ashes in the sea—the emphasis being on making absolutely sure that the draugr was dead and gone.      The draugar were said to be either hel-blár or nár-fölr . The death-blue color was not actually grey but was a dark blue or maroon hue which covered the entire body.

        " describes how bones were dug up belonging to a dead sorceress who had appeared in dreams, and they were blue and evil looking. Magnusson and Palsson, Laxdaela Saga, p. 235.     The resting place of the draugr was a tomb which they were able to leave during the night to visit the living. Such visits are supposed to be horrible events that often end in death for one or more of the living, which would then warrant the exhumation of the draugr by a hero.     The draugrs motivation was primarily jealousy and greed. Greed causes it to viciously attack any would-be grave robbers, but the draugr also expresses an innate jealousy of the living stemming from a longing for the things of life which it once had. They also exhibit an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, as shown in the encounter of Aran and Asmund, sword brothers who made an oath that, if one should die, the other would sit vigil with him for three days inside the burial mound. When Aran died, Asmund brought his own possessions into the barrow—banners, armor, hawk, hound, and horse—then set himself to wait the three days:            The main indication that a deceased person will become a draugr is that the corpse is not in a horizontal position but is found in an upright or sitting position, indicating that the dead might return. Any mean, nasty, or greedy person can become a draugr. As Ármann notes, most medieval Icelandic ghosts are evil or marginal people. If not dissatisfied or evil, they are unpopular .             Traditionally, a pair of open iron scissors was placed on the chest of the recently deceased, and straws or twigs might be hidden among their clothes. The big toes were tied together or needles were driven through the soles of the feet in order to keep the dead from being able to walk. Tradition also held that the coffin should be lifted and lowered in three different directions as it was carried from the house to confuse a possible draugrs sense of direction.     The most effective means of preventing the return of the dead was believed to be a corpse door, a special door through which the corpse was carried feet-first with people surrounding it so that the corpse couldnt see where it was going. The door was then bricked up to prevent a return. It is speculated that this belief began in Denmark and spread throughout the Norse culture, founded on the idea that the dead could only leave through the way they entered.     In Eyrbyggja saga, draugar are driven off by holding a door-doom . One by one, they are summoned to the door-doom and given judgment and forced out of the home by this legal method. The home was then purified with holy water to ensure that they never came back.       A variation of the draugr is the haugbui  which was a mound-dweller, the dead body living on within its tomb. The notable difference between the two was that the haugbui is unable to leave its grave site and only attacks those who trespass upon their territory.     The haugbui was rarely found far from its burial place and is a type of undead commonly found in Norse sagas. The creature is said to either swim alongside boats or sail around them in a partially submerged vessel, always on their own. In some accounts, witnesses portray them as shapeshifters who take on the appearance of seaweed or moss-covered stones on the shoreline.

Just before Grettir kills him, Glámr curses Grettir because Glámr was endowed with more evil force than most other ghosts , and thus he was able to speak and leave Grettir with his curse after his death.

        ", a shepherd is assaulted by a blue-black draugr. The shepherds neck is broken during the ensuing scuffle. The shepherd rises the next night as a draugr.       thu     In more recent Scandinavian folklore , the draug is often identified with the spirits of mariner s drowned at sea. The creature is said to possess a distinctly human form, with the exception that its head is composed entirely of seaweed . In other tellings, the draug is described as being a headless fisherman, dressed in oilskin and sailing in half a boat . This trait is common in the northernmost part of Norway, where life and culture was based on fishing more than anywhere else. The reason for this may be that the fishermen often drowned in great numbers, and the stories of restless dead coming in from sea were more common in the north than any other region of the country.     A recorded legend from Trøndelag tells how a cadaver lying on a beach became the object of a quarrel between the two types of draug . A similar source even tells of a third type, the gleip, known to hitch themselves to sailors walking ashore and make them slip on the wet rocks.     But, though the draug usually presages death, there is an amusing account in Northern Norway of a northerner who managed to outwit him:             The modern and popular connection between the draug and the sea can be traced back to authors like Jonas Lie and Regine Nordmann, whose works include several books of fairy tales, as well as the drawings of Theodor Kittelsen , who spent some years living in Svolvær . Up north, the tradition of sea-draugs is especially vivid.     Arne Garborg describes land-draugs coming fresh from the graveyards , and the term draug is even used of vampires . The notion of draugs who live in the mountains is present in the poetic works of Henrik Ibsen , and Aasmund Olavsson Vinje . The Nynorsk translation of ": null
