The mountain shelters this citadel on a broad bench. Then it rises three miles above it as if its peak tended toward heaven. There was an ancient temple there in which Apollo used to be worshipped according to the old pagan rite by the foolish local farmers. Around it had grown up a grove dedicated to demon worship, where even at that time a wild crowd still devoted themselves to unholy sacrifices. When the man of God arrived, he smashed the idol, overturned the altar and cut down the grove of trees. He built a chapel dedicated to St. Martin in the temple of Apollo and another to St. John where the altar of Apollo had stood. And he summoned the people of the district to the faith by his unceasing preaching.      Pope Gregory Is biography of Benedict claims that Satan opposed the monks repurposing the site. In one story, Satan invisibly sits on a rock making it too heavy to remove until Benedict drives him off. In another story, Satan taunts Benedict and then collapses a wall on a young monk, who is brought back to life by Benedict. Pope Gregory also relays that the monks found a pagan idol of bronze when digging at the site .      Archaeologist ": null

Benedict scholar Terrence Kardong examines why Benedict did not face stiffer opposition in his seizure of the site from the local pagans. He contrasts this with the 42-year struggle faced by St. Martin of Tours in western Gaul by pagans angry at his attacks on their shrines: By the time of Benedict, paganism was in a weaker condition in western Europe than it had been in Martins time. And, of course, it must be remembered that Martin as a bishop was a much more prominent churchman than Benedict. This was an isolated and unusual episode in Benedicts monastic career. Martin, however, was thrust out of his monastery into the role of a missionary bishop in the fourth century.     Benedict scholars note the heavy influence of ": null

        " Life of Martin on Pope Gregory Is biography of Benedict, including the account of his seizure of Monte Cassino. Benedicts violence against a pagan holy place recalls both Martins assault against pagan shrines generations before and the Biblical story of conquering Israel entering the Holy Land . De Vogue writes this mountain had to be conquered from an idolatrous people and purified from its devilish horrors. And like conquering Israel, Benedict came precisely to carry out this purification. No doubt Gregory had this biblical model uppermost in his mind, as is clear from the terms he uses to describe the work of destruction. At the same time, neither Gregory nor Benedict could have forgotten the similar line of action taken by St. Martin against the pagan shrines of Gaul.      Pope Gregory Is account of Benedict at Monte Cassino is seen by scholars as the final setting for an epic set in motion at Subiaco. In his earlier setting Benedict had twice shown complete mastery over his aggressiveness, Benedict is now allowed to use it without restraint in the service of God. Scholars note that this striking contrast is not stressed by Gregory but rather both settings are portrayed as part of a single battle account against the same demonic enemy. Where Satan concealed himself behind underlings at Subiaco, at Monte Cassino he drops the masks to enter into a desperate attempt to prevent an abbey from being built, and that the sole cause of this eruption of satanic action is the suppression of pagan worship on the high places.

Unlike the stories that may have influenced Pope Gregorys structure of the biography, Benedicts victories are practical, preventing Satan from stopping work on the abbey at Monte Cassino. Benedicts prayers are portrayed as the driving force behind the building of the abbey and the triumphs over Satan, through prayer Benedict the monk wrests from the devil a well-determined base which he never leaves. After the completion of the abbey, Satans appearances in the story diminish back to the same level as Subiaco, Only after the saints death and by Gods permission would other enemies, the Lombards, succeed in sacking it.

The Rule of St. Benedict mandated the moral obligations to care for the sick. So in Monte Cassino St. Benedict founded a hospital that is considered today to have been the first in Europe of the new era. Benedictine monks took care of the sick and wounded there according to Benedicts Rule. The monastic routine called for hard work. The care of the sick was such an important duty that those caring for them were enjoined to act as if they served Christ directly. Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at nearby Subiaco , where hospitals were settled, too, as adjuncts to the monasteries to provide charity. Soon many monasteries were founded throughout Europe, and everywhere there were hospitals like those in Monte Cassino.     Pope Gregory Is account of Benedicts construction was confirmed by archaeological discoveries made after the destruction of 42 Adalbert de Vogüé recounts that Traces have been found of the oratories of St. Martin and of St. John the Baptist, with additions from the eighth and eleventh centuries, together with their pre-Christian cellars. The first one which Benedict built in the temple itself was only twelve meters long and eight wide. From this, we can infer a fairly small community. The second oratory, on the mountain-top, where the pagan altar had stood in the open air, was of the same width but somewhat longer .        Monte Cassino became a model for future developments.
