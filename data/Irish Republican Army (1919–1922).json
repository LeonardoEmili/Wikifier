The Dáil leadership worried that the Volunteers would not accept its authority, given that, under their own constitution, they were bound to obey their own executive and no other body. In August 1919, Brugha proposed to the Dáil that the Volunteers be asked to swear allegiance to the Dáil, but another year passed before the Volunteers took an oath of allegiance to the Irish Republic and its government, throughout August 1920 . During this time, the Volunteers gradually became known as the Irish Republican Army .     A power struggle continued between Brugha and Collins, both cabinet ministers, over who had the greater influence. Brugha was nominally the superior as Minister for Defence, but Collinss power base came from his position as Director of Organisation of the IRA and from his membership on the Supreme Council of the IRB.

Cottrell, Peter The Anglo-Irish War The Troubles of 1913-1922, London: Osprey, 2006 page 28. The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War as potential informers, but there were a number of exceptions such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle. The IRA divided its members into three classes, namely unreliable , reliable and active .  The unreliable members were those who were nominally IRA members but did not do very much for the struggle, reliable members played a supporting role in the war while occasionally fighting and the active men those who were engaged in full-time fighting. Of the IRA brigades only about one to two-thirds were considered to be reliable while those considered active were even smaller. A disproportionate number of the active IRA men were teachers; medical students; shoe-makers and boot-makers; those engaged in building trades like painters, carpenters, bricklayers, etc.; drapers assistants; and creamery workers. Hart 1999, p. 210. The Canadian historian Peter Hart wrote ...the guerrillas were disproportionately skilled, trained and urban . Hart 1999, p. 212. Farmers and fishermen tended to be underrepresented in the IRA. Hart 1999, pp. 211-212.

        " than farmers or fishermen, and thus to have a stronger sense of Irish nationalism. Hart 1999, p. 226. Furthermore, the authority of the Crown tended to be stronger in towns and cities than in the countryside and as such those engaged in Irish nationalist activities in urban areas were much more likely to come into conflict with the Crown, thus leading to a greater chance of radicalisation. Hart 1999, p. 227. Finally, the British tactic of blowing up the homes of IRA members had the effect of discouraging many farmers from joining the struggle as the destruction of the family farm could easily reduce a farmer and his family to destitution. Of the active IRA members, three-quarters were in their late teens or early 20s and only 5% of the active men were in the age range of 40 or older. Hart 1999, p. 216. The active members were overwhelmingly single men with only 4% being married or engaged in a relationship. Hart 1999, pp. 216-217. The life of an active IRA man with its stress of living on the run and constantly being in hiding tended to attract single men who could adjust to this lifestyle far more easily than a man in a relationship. Furthermore, the IRA preferred to recruit single men as it was found that singles could devote themselves more wholeheartedly to the struggle.     Women were active in the republican movement, but almost no women fought with the IRA whose active members were almost entirely male. Hart 1999, pp. 217-218. The IRA was not a sectarian group and went out of its way to proclaim it was open to all Irishmen, but its membership was largely Catholic with virtually no Protestants serving as active IRA men. Hart 1999, p. 218. Hart wrote that in his study of the IRA membership that he found only three Protestants serving as active IRA men between 1919 and 1921. Of the 917 IRA men convicted by British courts under the Defence of the Realm Act in 1919, only one was a Protestant. The majority of those serving in the IRA were practicing Catholics, but there was a large minority of pagans as atheists or non-practicing Catholics were known in Ireland. The majority of the IRA men serving in metropolitan Britain were permanent residents with very few sent over from Ireland. The majority of the IRA men operating in Britain were Irish-born, but there a substantial minority who were British-born, something that made them especially insistent on asserting their Irish identity.                       The IRA fought a guerrilla war against the Crown forces in Ireland from 1919 to July 1921. The most intense period of the war was from November 1920 onwards.

As he feared, the destruction proved a pyrrhic victory for the Republic, with so many IRA men killed or captured that the IRA in Dublin suffered a severe blow.     This was also a period of social upheaval in Ireland, with frequent strikes as well as other manifestations of class conflict. In this regard, the IRA acted to a large degree as an agent of social control and stability, driven by the need to preserve cross-class unity in the national struggle, and on occasion being used to break strikes.
