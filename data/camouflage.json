Methods may be applied on their own or in combination.            Crypsis means making the animal or military equipment hard to see . Visual crypsis can be achieved in many different ways, such as by living underground or by being active only at night, as well as by a variety of methods of camouflage.

Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres distance.  However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied by young giraffes being far more vulnerable to predation than adults: more than half of all giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the presence of a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be very well camouflaged; this is supported by coat markings being strongly inherited.

But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators ability to estimate the preys speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape.  Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size . As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied.  Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, there would be an evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.
