        " in 42 However, the keystream must be generated completely at random with at least the same length as the plaintext and cannot be used more than once. This makes the system cumbersome to implement in many practical applications, and as a result the one-time pad has not been widely used, except for the most critical applications. Key generation, distribution and management are critical for those applications.     A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient key such as 42 bits. Based on this key, it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar fashion to the one-time pad. However, this comes at a cost. The keystream is now pseudorandom and so is not truly random. The proof of security associated with the one-time pad no longer holds. It is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure.       A stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state. This state is updated in essentially two ways: if the state changes independently of the plaintext or ciphertext messages, the cipher is classified as a synchronous stream cipher. By contrast, self-synchronising stream ciphers update their state based on previous ciphertext digits.          In a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudo-random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages, and then combined with the plaintext or the ciphertext . In the most common form, binary digits are used , and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the ": null

If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost. To restore synchronisation, various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption. Another approach is to tag the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output.     If, however, a digit is corrupted in transmission, rather than added or lost, only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message. This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high; however, it makes it less likely the error would be detected without further mechanisms. Moreover, because of this property, synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to ": null

        "s: if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext, he might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit; for example, flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped in the plaintext.       Another approach uses several of the previous N ciphertext digits to compute the keystream. Such schemes are known as self-synchronizing stream ciphers, asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey . The idea of self-synchronization was patented in 42 and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving N ciphertext digits, making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream. Single-digit errors are limited in their effect, affecting only up to N plaintext digits.     An example of a self-synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in ": null

The output is the exclusive OR of the last bit produced by LFSR42 and LFSR42 The initial state of the three LFSRs is the key.     The stop-and-go generator consists of two LFSRs. One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a 42 otherwise it repeats its previous output. This output is then combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate.     The ": null

If the first LFSR outputs 42 however, the output of the second is discarded, and no bit is output by the generator. This mechanism suffers from timing attacks on the second generator, since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generators state. This can be alleviated by buffering the output.       Another approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non-linear filtering function.               Instead of a linear driving device, one may use a nonlinear update function. For example, Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions  with a single cycle on n-bit words.
