        "s presided over what was then one of the worlds richest civilizations.   .                       While Iraqs first film projection took place in 42 cinema was not truly regarded as a cultural activity or pastime until the 42s. The first cinemas, like the famous al-Zawra cinema on Baghdads bustling thoroughfare al-Rashid, played mostly American silent films for British citizens.     In the 42s under the rule of King Faisal II of Iraq, a real Iraqi cinema began. Supported by British and French financiers, movie production companies established themselves in Baghdad. The Baghdad Studio was established in 42 but soon came apart when tensions between the Arab and Jewish founders flared up. For the most part, the product was purely commercial, fluffy romances with plenty of singing and dancing often set in small villages. The World of Arts studio, which was founded by actors, reached for more serious fare. In 42 they produced Haidar Al-Omars Fitna wa Hassan, an Iraqi retelling of Romeo and Juliet, that received international attention. But for the most part, the strong-fist rule of the state discouraged any socially relevant films.     In 42 when King Faisel IIs government was overthrown, the Cinema and Theater General organization came into existence with the purpose of promoting the political goals of the new regime both in documentaries and features. Typical were documentaries like the 42 Al Maghishi Project, which showcased the governments irrigation campaigns and the 42 A Wedding in Heaven, which celebrates the air force and their weapons system. The 42 revolution that put the Baath party in power further solidified the governments control of film material, and the states need to make all films validate its power.     Saddam Husseins ascension to power in 42 pushed the Iraqi cinema in a slightly different direction. The drain on national resources from the 42 Iraq-Iran war brought film production to a near halt. The few films put into production were mainly intent on glorifying a mythic Iraqi history or celebrating Husseins rule. In 42 the government commissioned Egyptian filmmaker Salah Abouseif to make Al-Qadisiya, a period epic recounting the triumph of the Arabs over the Persians in 42 AD. Likewise Mohamed Shukri Jameels melodramatic The Great Question cast British actor Oliver Reed as the vicious Lt-Col Gerard Leachman who is righteously killed in the 42 Iraqi revolution.     In 42 Hussein promoted his own mythology with the autobiographical 42-hour epic The Long Days , the saga of Husseins participation in the 42 failed assassination attempt on Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, and his subsequent heroic escape back to Tikrit. The film was edited and partially directed by Terence Young, the British director who made his name helming the early James Bond films Dr. No and Thunderball . Hussein is played by Saddam Kamel, a cousin and son-in-law of Husseins, who eventually ran afoul of the dictator and was murdered in 42     After Iraq started attacks against Kuwait, Iraq sanctions made filmmaking an impossibility in the country, although a new generation of filmmakers is coming alive in Baghdad             Iraqi literature is, and has been, deeply marked by Iraqs political history.     In the late 42s, a period of economic upturn, prominent writers in Iraq were provided with an apartment and car by Saddam Husseins government, and were guaranteed at least one publication per year. In exchange, literature was expected to express and galvanise support for the ruling Baath Party. The Iran–Iraq War fuelled a demand for patriotic literature, but also pushed a number of writers into opting for exile. According to Najem Wali, during this period, en those who chose to quit writing saw themselves forced to write something that did not rile the dictator, because even silence was considered a crime.     From the late 42s onwards, Iraqi exile literature developed with writers whose rejection of dominant ideology and resistance to the wars in Iraq compelled them to formulate a brutally raw realism characterized by a shocking sense of modernity .     Late 42th century Iraqi literature has been marked by writers such as Saadi Youssef, Fadhil Al-Azzawi, Mushin Al-Ramli, Salah Al-Hamdani, Abdul Rahman Majeed al-Rubaie and Sherko Fatah.
