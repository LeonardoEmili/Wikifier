Her Ghazni strain were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain.  The French breed club was formed in 1939 . The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.     The Afghan Hound can also come with a much more patterned coat. This descends from the Bell-Murrays and the Ghazni lines, and is displayed in much lighter feathering of coat, deeper saddle and much shorter hair on the face and neck. It is believed that these particular afghan hounds were a product of much hotter parts of the country.      The spectacular beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable show dogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world.
