He was romanticized after his death and became the inspiration for an archetypal pirate in works of fiction across many genres.       Little is known about Blackbeards early life. It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35  and  40 years old and thus born in about 1680.   In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach; the latter is most often used. Several spellings of his surname exist—Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche and Theach. One early source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely. Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and this makes it unlikely that Teachs real name will ever be known.

In September Teach and Hornigold encountered Stede Bonnet, a landowner and military officer from a wealthy family who had turned to piracy earlier that year. Bonnets crew of about 70  were reportedly dissatisfied with his command, so with Bonnets permission, Teach took control of his ship Revenge.

Bostocks deposition describes Teach as a tall spare man with a very black beard which he wore very long . It is the first recorded account of Teachs appearance and is the source of his cognomen, Blackbeard.  Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. Johnson described him as such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful. Whether Johnsons description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of ones enemies, than rely on bluster alone.  Teach was tall, with broad shoulders. He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet.

Konstam proposes a similar idea, explaining that Teach began to see Queen Annes Revenge as something of a liability; while a pirate fleet was anchored, news of this was sent to neighbouring towns and colonies, and any vessels nearby would delay sailing. It was prudent therefore for Teach not to linger for too long, although wrecking the ship was a somewhat extreme measure.           Before sailing northward on his remaining sloop to ": null

As Maynard drew back to fire once again, Teach moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynards men. Badly wounded, he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynards crew. The remaining pirates quickly surrendered. Those left on the Adventure were captured by the Rangers crew, including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship.

He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design , and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king. Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice. By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion.  Lee concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods.  Eden doubtless shared the same view. As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4  April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning. Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the Adventure in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize. Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knights home to give him presents. This testimony and the letter found on Teachs body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence. Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswoods witnesses. He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law, the other witness, an African, was unable to testify. The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity. The board found Knight innocent of all charges. He died later that year.       Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part. The goods which Brand seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief. The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until Edens death on 17  March 1722.
