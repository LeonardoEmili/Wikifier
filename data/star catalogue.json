To observe the entire celestial sphere without burdening too many institutions, the sky was divided among 20 observatories, by declination zones. Each observatory exposed and measured the plates of its zone, using a standardized telescope  so each plate photographed had a similar scale of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm. The ": null
