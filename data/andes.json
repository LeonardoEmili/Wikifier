Geomorphological and geophysical investigation of a complex rock glacier system – Morenas Coloradas valley     Though precipitation increases with the height, there are semiarid conditions in the nearly  highest mountains of the Andes. This dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at 42–42° S. The valley bottoms have no woods, just dwarf scrub. The largest glaciers, as e.g. the Plomo glacier and the Horcones glaciers, do not even reach  in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness.
