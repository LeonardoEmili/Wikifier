        " such as tetraalkylammonium halides.          Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions ; extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation ; and having an electronegativity higher than bromines , so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, nitrides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine.  Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821–4     Bromination of metals with Br 2 tends to yield lower oxidation states than chlorination with Cl 2 when a variety of oxidation states is available. Bromides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrobromic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas. These methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide, high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine, a volatile metal bromide, ": null
