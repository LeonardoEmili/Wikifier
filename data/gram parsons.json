        " Presidents Award for 2003 and a ranking at No.  87 on  Rolling Stone s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.         Ingram Cecil Connor III was born on November 5, 1946, in Winter Haven, Florida , to Ingram Cecil Coon Dog and Avis Connor . The Connors normally resided at their main residence in Waycross , Georgia , but Avis traveled to her hometown in Florida to give birth. She was the daughter of citrus fruit magnate John A. Snively , who held extensive properties in Winter Haven and in Waycross. The senior Ingram Connor was a famous World War II flying ace , decorated with the Air Medal , who was present at the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor . Biographer David Meyer characterized these parents as loving; he wrote in Twenty Thousand Roads that they are remembered as affectionate parents and a loving couple .     However, he also notes that unhappiness was eating away at the Connor family : Avis suffered from depression, and both parents were alcoholic s. Ingram Connor committed suicide two days before Christmas in 1958, devastating the 12-year-old Gram and his younger sister, also named Avis. Avis subsequently married Robert Parsons, who adopted Gram and his sister; they took his surname.     Gram Parsons briefly attended the prestigious Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida , before transferring to the public Winter Haven High School ; after failing his junior year, he returned to Bolles . For a time, the family found a stability of sorts. They were torn apart in early 1965, when Robert became embroiled in an extramarital affair and Avis heavy drinking led to her death from cirrhosis on June 5, 1965, the day of Grams graduation from Bolles.     As his family disintegrated around him, Parsons developed strong musical interests, particularly after seeing Elvis Presley perform in concert on February 22, 1956, in Waycross. Five years later, while barely in his teens, he played in rock and roll cover bands such as the Pacers and the Legends, headlining in clubs owned by his stepfather in the Winter Haven/Polk County area. By the age of 16, he graduated to folk music , and in 1963 he teamed with his first professional outfit, the Shilos, in Greenville, South Carolina . Heavily influenced by The Kingston Trio and The Journeymen, the band played hootenannies , coffee house s and high school auditoriums; as Parsons was still enrolled in prep school, he only performed with the group in select engagements. Forays into New York City included a performance at Floridas exhibition in the 1964 New York Worlds Fair and regular appearances at the Café Rafio on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village in the summer of 1964. Although John Phillips arranged an exploratory meeting with Albert Grossman , the impresario balked at booking the group for a Christmas engagement at The Bitter End when he discovered that the Shilos were high school students. Following a recording session at the radio station of Bob Jones University , the group—encumbered by a creative impasse amid the emergence of folk rock —dissolved in the spring of 1965.     Despite his middling grades and test scores, Parsons was admitted to Harvard University s class of 1969 on the basis of a strong admissions essay. Although he claimed to have studied theology in subsequent interviews, Parsons seldom attended his general education courses before departing in early 1966 after one semester. He did not become seriously interested in country music until his time at Harvard, where he heard Merle Haggard for the first time.     In 1966, he and other musicians from the Boston folk scene formed a group called the International Submarine Band . After briefly residing in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx , they relocated to Los Angeles the following year. Following several lineup changes, the band signed to Lee Hazlewood s LHI Records , where they spent late 1967 recording ": null

Safe at Home would remain unreleased until mid-1968, by which time the International Submarine Band had broken up.       By 1968, Parsons had come to the attention of The Byrds bassist , Chris Hillman , via business manager Larry Spector as a possible replacement band member following the departures of David Crosby and Michael Clarke from the group in late 1967. Parsons had been acquainted with Hillman since the pair had met in a bank during 1967 and in February 1968 he passed an audition for the band, being initially recruited as a jazz pianist but soon switching to rhythm guitar and vocals.     Although Parsons was an equal contributor to the band, he was not regarded as a full member of The Byrds by the bands record label , Columbia Records . Consequently, when the Byrds Columbia recording contract was renewed on February 29, 1968, it was only original members Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman who signed it. Parsons, like fellow new recruit Kevin Kelley , was hired as a sideman and received a salary from McGuinn and Hillman. In later years, this led Hillman to state, Gram was hired. He was not a member of The Byrds, ever. He was on salary, that was the only way we could get him to turn up. However, these comments overlook the fact that Parsons, like Kelley, was considered a bona fide member of the band during 1968 and, as such, was given equal billing alongside McGuinn, Hillman, and Kelley on the ": null

        " album and in contemporary press coverage of the band.         Sweetheart of the Rodeo was originally conceived by band leader Roger McGuinn as a sprawling, double album history of American popular music . It was to begin with bluegrass music , then move through country and western , jazz , rhythm and blues , and rock music , before finally ending with the most advanced form of electronic music . However, as recording plans were made, Parsons exerted a controlling influence over the group, persuading the other members to leave Los Angeles and record the album in Nashville, Tennessee . Along the way, McGuinns original album concept was jettisoned in favor of a fully fledged country project, which included Parsons songs such as One Hundred Years from Now and Hickory Wind , along with compositions by Bob Dylan , Woody Guthrie , Merle Haggard, and others.     Recording sessions for Sweetheart of the Rodeo commenced at Columbia Records recording studio s in the Music Row area of Nashville on March 9, 1968. Midway through, the sessions moved to Columbia Studios, Hollywood, Los Angeles. They finally came to a close on May 27, 1968. However, Parsons was still under contract to LHI Records and consequently, Hazlewood contested Parsons appearance on the album and threatened legal action. As a result, McGuinn ended up replacing three of Parsons lead vocals with his own singing on the finished album, a move that still rankled Parsons as late as 1973, when he told Cameron Crowe in an interview that McGuinn erased it and did the vocals himself and fucked it up. However, Parsons is still featured as lead vocalist on the songs Youre Still on My Mind , Life in Prison , and Hickory Wind .     While in England with The Byrds in the summer of 1968, Parsons left the band due to his concerns over a planned concert tour of South Africa, and after speaking to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards about the tour, he cited opposition to that countrys apartheid policies. There has been some doubt expressed by Hillman over the sincerity of Parsons protest. It appears that Parsons was mostly apolitical, although he did refer to one of the younger African-American butlers in the Connor household as being like a brother to him in an interview. During this period Parsons became acquainted with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones . Before Parsons departure from The Byrds, he had accompanied the two Rolling Stones to Stonehenge in the English county of Wiltshire . Immediately after leaving the band, Parsons stayed at Richards house and the pair developed a close friendship over the next few years, with Parsons reintroducing the guitarist to country music. According to Stones confidant and close friend of Parsons, Phil Kaufman, the two would sit around for hours playing obscure country records and trading off on various songs with their guitars.       thu in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville   Returning to Los Angeles, Parsons sought out Hillman, and the two formed The Flying Burrito Brothers with bassist Chris Ethridge and pedal steel player Sneaky Pete Kleinow .

    {
        " marked the culmination of Parsons post-1966 musical vision: a modernized variant of the Bakersfield sound that was popularized by Buck Owens amalgamated with strands of soul and psychedelic rock . The band appeared on the album cover wearing Nudie suits emblazoned with all sorts of hippie accoutrements, including marijuana , Tuinal and Seconal -inspired patches on Parsons suit. Along with the Parsons-Hillman originals Christines Tune and Sin City were versions of the soul music classics The Dark End of the Street and Do Right Woman , the latter featuring David Crosby on high harmony. The albums original songs were the result of a very productive songwriting partnership between Parsons and Hillman, who were sharing a bachelor pad in the San Fernando Valley during this period. The atypically pronounced gospel-soul influence on this album likely evolved from the ecumenical tastes of bassist Chris Ethridge and frequent jamming with Delaney & Bonnie and Richards during the albums gestation.     Original drummer Eddie Hoh proved to be unable to perform adequate takes due to an incipient substance abuse problem and was dismissed after two songs, leading the group to record the remainder of the album with a variety of session drummers, including former International Submarine Band drummer Jon Corneal and Popeye Phillips of Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show . Before commencing live performances, the group ultimately settled upon original Byrds drummer Michael Clarke . Technically maladroit in comparison to his predecessors, Clarkes striking physical appearance proved to be the primary criterion in this decision; an associate of the band would later recall that the Burritos had to be pretty and Corneal didnt fit from that standpoint.     While unsuccessful from a commercial standpoint, the album was measured by rock critic Robert Christgau as an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact. Embarking on a cross-country tour via train, as Parsons suffered from periodic bouts of fear of flying, the group squandered most of their money in a perpetual poker game and received bewildered reactions in most cities. Parsons was frequently indulging in massive quantities of psilocybin and cocaine , so his performances were erratic at best, while much of the bands repertoire consisted of vintage honky-tonk and soul standards with few originals. Perhaps the most successful appearance occurred in Philadelphia, where the group opened for the reconstituted Byrds. Midway through their set, Parsons joined the headline act and fronted his former group on renditions of Hickory Wind and You Dont Miss Your Water . The other Burritos surfaced with the exception of Clarke, and the joint aggregation played several songs, including Long Black Veil and Goin Back .     The Flying Burrito Brothers appeared at the Sky River Rock Festival in Tenino, Washington, at the end of August.     After returning to Los Angeles, the group recorded The Train Song , written during an increasingly infrequent songwriting session on the train and produced by 1950s R & B legends Larry Williams and Johnny Guitar Watson . Despite a request from the Burritos that the remnants of their publicity budget be diverted to promotion of the single, it also flopped. During this period, Ethridge realized that he did not share Parsons and Hillmans affinity for country music, precipitating his departure shortly thereafter. He was replaced by lead guitarist Bernie Leadon , while Hillman reverted to bass.     By this time, Parsonss own use of drugs had increased so much that new songs were rare and much of his time was diverted to partying with the Stones, who briefly relocated to America in the summer of 1969 to finish their forthcoming ": null

As they prepared to play the nations largest basketball arenas and early stadium concerts, the Burritos played to dwindling nightclub audiences; on one occasion, Jagger had to beseech Parsons to fulfill an obligation to his group. As Parsons became a trust-fund baby when he came of age, he was still receiving about $30,000 per year from his family trust during this period, distinguishing him from his many hungry, hard-scrabble peers.     However, the singers dedication to the Rolling Stones was rewarded when the Burrito Brothers were booked as one of the acts at the infamous Altamont Music Festival .

To this end, manager Jim Dickson instigated a loose session where the band recorded several honky tonk staples from their live act, contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein , and Larry Williams Bony Moronie . This was soon scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budget.

Like its predecessor, Burrito Deluxe underperformed commercially but also failed to carry the critical cachet of the debut. Disenchanted with the band, Parsons left the Burritos in mutual agreement with Hillman, who was long fatigued by his friends unprofessionalism.

We couldnt get on country radio and we couldnt get on rock radio! We were the outlaw country band for a brief period.         Parsons signed a solo deal with A & M Records and moved in with producer Terry Melcher in early 1970. Melcher, who had worked with The Byrds and The Beach Boys , was a member of the successful duo Bruce & Terry , also known as The Rip Chords. The two shared a mutual penchant for cocaine and heroin, and as a result, the sessions were largely unproductive, with Parsons eventually losing interest in the project. Terry loved Gram and wanted to produce him ... But neither of them could get anything done, recalled writer and mutual friend Eve Babitz . Long lost, the tapes from this session have gathered a legendary patina, writes David Meyer. The recording stalled, and the master tapes were checked out, but there is conflict as to whether Gram ... or Melcher took them .     He then accompanied the Rolling Stones on their 1971 U.K. tour in the hope of being signed to the newly formed Rolling Stones Records ; by this juncture, Parsons and Richards had mulled the possibility of recording a duo album.

Eventually, Parsons was asked to leave by Anita Pallenberg , Richards longtime domestic partner. Decades later, Richards suggested in his memoir that Jagger may have been the impetus for Parsons departure because Richards was spending so much time playing music with Parsons. Rumors have persisted that he appears somewhere on the legendary album, and while Richards concedes that it is very likely he is among the chorus of singers on Sweet Virginia , this has never been substantiated. Parsons attempted to rekindle his relationship with the band on their 1972 American tour to no avail.     After leaving the Stones camp, Parsons married Burrell in 1971 at his stepfathers New Orleans estate. Allegedly, the relationship was far from stable, with Burrell cutting a needy and jealous figure while Parsons quashed her burgeoning film career. Many of the singers closest associates and friends claim that Parsons was preparing to commence divorce proceedings at the time of his death; the couple had already separated by this point.     Parsons in 19   Parsons and Burrell enjoyed the most idyllic time of their relationship in the second half of 1971, visiting old cohorts like Ian Dunlop and Family / Blind Faith / Traffic member Ric Grech in England. With the assistance of Grech and one of the bassists friends, a doctor who also dabbled in country music and is now known as Hank Wangford , Parsons eventually stopped taking heroin; a previous treatment suggested by William Burroughs proved unsuccessful.     He returned to the US for a one-off concert with the Burritos, and at Hillmans request went to hear Emmylou Harris sing in a small club in Washington, D.C. They befriended each other and, within a year, he asked her to join him in Los Angeles for another attempt to record his first solo album. It came as a surprise to many when Parsons was enthusiastically signed to Reprise Records by Mo Ostin in mid-1972. The ensuing ": null

It included six new songs from a creatively revitalized Parsons alongside several country covers, including Tompall Glaser s Streets of Baltimore and George Jones Thats All It Took .     Parsons, by now featuring Harris as his duet partner, toured across the United States as Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels in February–March 1973. Unable to afford the services of the TCB Band for a month, the group featured the talents of Colorado-based rock guitarist Jock Bartley , veteran Nashville session musician Neil Flanz on pedal steel, eclectic bassist Kyle Tullis and former Mountain drummer N.D. Smart . The touring party also included Gretchen Parsons—by this point extremely envious of Harris—and Harris young daughter. Coordinating the spectacle as road manager was Phil Kaufman , who had served time with Charles Manson on Terminal Island in the mid-sixties and first met Parsons while working for the Stones in 1968. Kaufman ensured that the performer stayed away from substance abuse, limiting his alcohol intake during shows and throwing out any drugs smuggled into hotel rooms. At first, the band was under-rehearsed and played poorly; however, they improved markedly with steady gigging and received rapturous responses at several leading countercultural venues, including Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, Texas , Maxs Kansas City in New York City, and Liberty Hall in Houston, Texas . According to a number of sources, it was Harris who forced the band to practice and work up an actual set list.

        ", he again used Harris and members of the TCB Band for the sessions. The record received even more enthusiastic reviews than had GP, and has since attained classic status. Its most celebrated song is a Parsons-Harris duet cover of Love Hurts , a song that remains in Harris solo repertoire. Notable Parsons-penned songs included $1000 Wedding, a holdover from the Burrito Brothers era, and Brass Buttons, a 1965 opus that addressed his mothers alcoholism. A new version of Hickory Wind was included, while Ooh Las Vegas, co-written with Grech, dated from the GP sessions. Although Parsons only contributed two new songs to the album , he was highly enthused with his new sound and seemed to have finally adopted a diligent mindset to his musical career, limiting his intake of alcohol and opiates during most of the sessions.     Before recording, Parsons and Harris played a preliminary four-show mini-tour as the headline act in a June 1973 Warner Brothers country rock package with the New Kentucky Colonels and Country Gazette . A shared backing band included former Byrds lead guitarist and Kentucky Colonel Clarence White , Pete Kleinow , and Chris Ethridge . On July 14, 1973, White was killed by a drunk driver in Palmdale, California , while loading equipment in his car for a concert with the New Kentucky Colonels. At Whites funeral, Parsons and Bernie Leadon launched into an impromptu touching rendition of Farther Along ; that evening, Parsons reportedly informed Phil Kaufman of his final wish: to be cremated in Joshua Tree. Despite the almost insurmountable setback, Parsons, Harris, and the other musicians decided to continue with plans for a fall tour.     In the summer of 1973, Parsons Topanga Canyon home burned to the ground, the result of a stray cigarette. Nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the exception of a guitar and a prized Jaguar automobile. The fire proved to be the last straw in the relationship between Burrell and Parsons, who moved into a spare room in Kaufmans house. While not recording, he frequently hung out and jammed with members of New Jersey–based country rockers Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends and the proto-punk Jonathan Richman & the Modern Lovers, who were represented by former Byrds manager Eddie Tickner.     Before formally breaking up with Burrell, Parsons already had a woman waiting in the wings. While recording, he saw a photo of a beautiful woman at a friends home and was instantly smitten. The woman turned out to be Margaret Fisher, a high school sweetheart of the singer from his Waycross, Georgia , days. Like Parsons, Fisher had drifted west and became established in the Bay Area rock scene. A meeting was arranged and the two instantly rekindled their relationship, with Fisher dividing her weeks between Los Angeles and San Francisco at Parsons expense.         In the late 1960s, Parsons became enamored of and began to vacation at Joshua Tree National Monument in southeastern California , where he frequently partook in psychedelics and reportedly experienced several UFO sightings . After splitting from Burrell, Parsons often spent his weekends in the area with Margaret Fisher and Phil Kaufman, with whom he had been living. Scheduled to resume touring in October 1973, Parsons decided to go on another recuperative excursion on September 17. Accompanying him were Fisher, personal assistant Michael Martin, and Dale McElroy, Martins girlfriend. Kaufman later declared that Parsons attorney was preparing divorce papers for him to serve to Burrell while the singer remained in Joshua Tree on September 20.     During the trip, Parsons often retreated to the desert, while the group visited bars in the nearby hamlet of Yucca Valley, California , on both nights of their stay. Parsons consumed large amounts of alcohol and barbiturate s. On September 18, Martin drove back to Los Angeles to resupply the group with marijuana. That night, after challenging Fisher and McElroy to drink with him , he said, Ill drink for the three of us, and proceeded to drink six double tequilas. They then returned to the Joshua Tree Inn, where Parsons purchased morphine from an unknown young woman. After being injected by her in room 8, he overdosed. Fisher gave Parsons an ice-cube suppository , and later on a cold shower. Instead of moving Parsons around the room, she put him to bed and went out to buy coffee in the hope of reviving him, leaving McElroy to stand watch. As his respiration became irregular and later ceased, McElroy attempted resuscitation . Her efforts failed and Fisher, watching from outside, was visibly alarmed. After further failed attempts, they decided to call an ambulance. Parsons was declared dead on his arrival at High Desert Memorial Hospital at 12:15  a.m. on September 19, 1973, in Yucca Valley. The official cause of death was an overdose of morphine and alcohol. ": null

        "; accessed September 24, 2017.     According to Fisher in the 2005 biography Grievous Angel: An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons, the amount of morphine consumed by Parsons would be lethal to three regular users; thus, he had likely overestimated his tolerance in light of his diminished intake despite his extensive experience with opiates. Keith Richards stated in the 2004 documentary film Fallen Angel that Parsons understood the danger of combining opiates and alcohol and should have known better. Upon Parsons death, Fisher and McElroy were returned to Los Angeles by Kaufman, who dispersed the remnants of Parsons drugs in the desert.     Before his death, Parsons stated that he wanted his body cremated at Joshua Tree and his ashes spread over Cap Rock, a prominent natural feature there; however, Parsons stepfather Bob organized a private ceremony back in New Orleans and neglected to invite any of his friends from the music industry. Two accounts state that Bob Parsons stood to inherit Grams share of his grandfathers estate if he could prove that Gram was a resident of Louisiana, explaining his eagerness to have him buried there.     thu   To fulfill Parsons funeral wishes, Kaufman and a friend stole his body from Los Angeles International Airport and in a borrowed hearse, they drove it to Joshua Tree. Upon reaching the Cap Rock section of the park, they attempted to cremate Parsons body by pouring five gallons of gasoline into the open coffin and throwing a lit match inside. What resulted was an enormous fireball. The police gave chase but, as one account puts it, the men were unencumbered by sobriety, and they escaped.     The two were arrested several days later. Since there was no law against stealing a dead body, they were only fined $750 for stealing the coffin and were not prosecuted for leaving of his charred remains in the desert. What remained of Parsons body, was eventually buried in Garden of Memories Cemetery in Metairie, Louisiana.     The site of Parsons cremation was marked by a small concrete slab and was presided over by a large rock flake known to rock climbers as The Gram Parsons Memorial Hand Traverse. The slab has since been removed by the U.S. National Park Service, and relocated to the Joshua Tree Inn. There is no monument at Cap Rock noting Parsons cremation at the site. Billboard Magazine article: Joshua Tree park guides are given the option to tell the story of Parsons cremation during tours, but there is no mention of the act in official maps or brochures. Fans regularly assemble simple rock structures and writings on the rock, which the park service periodically sand blasts to remove.       Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes Parsons as enormously influential for both country and rock, blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other. ... His influence could still be heard well into the next millennium. In his 2005 essay on Parsons for Rolling Stone magazines 100 Greatest Artist list , Keith Richards notes that Parsons recorded music output was pretty minimal. Nevertheless, Richards claims that Parsons effect on country music is enormous and adds that this is why were talking about him now.     The 2003 film ": null

The album was released four days before Parsons died.     A music festival called Gram Fest or the Cosmic American Music Festival was held annually in honor of Parsons in Joshua Tree, California, between 1996 and 2006. The show featured tunes written by Gram Parsons and Gene Clark as well as influential songs and musical styles from other artists that were part of that era. Performers were also encouraged to showcase their own material. The underlying theme of the event is to inspire the performers to take these musical styles to the next level of the creative process. Past concerts have featured such notable artists as Sneaky Pete Kleinow , Chris Ethridge , Spooner Oldham , John Molo , Jack Royerton, Gib Guilbeau , Counting Crows , Bob Warford, Rosie Flores , David Lowery , Barry and Holly Tashian , George Tomsco, Jann Browne , Lucinda Williams , Polly Parsons, The Road Mangler Phil Kaufman, Ben Fong-Torres , Victoria Williams , Mark Olson , and Sid Griffin , as well as a variety of many other bands that had played over the two or three day event. In addition, the Gram Parsons Tribute, in Waycross, Georgia, is a music festival remembering Parsons in the town in which he grew up. Additional tributes spring up every year, the latest being the Southern California Gram On! celebration by The Rickenbastards in July, 2013, celebrating the life and legacy of a simple country boy with a dream, Gram Parsons.     In February 2008, Grams protégée, Emmylou Harris , was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame . Despite his influence, however, Parsons has yet to be inducted. Radley Balko has written that Parsons may be the most influential artist yet to be inducted to either the Rock and Roll or Country Music Hall of Fame. And its a damned shame. The Gram Parsons Petition Project was begun in May 2008 in support of an ongoing drive to induct Parsons into the Country Music Hall of Fame. On September 19, 2008, the 35th anniversary of Parsons death, it was first presented to the Country Music Association and Hall as a List of Supporters together with the official Nomination Proposal. The online List of Supporters reached 10,000 on the 40th anniversary of his death, with nearly 14,000 currently listed. Annual Gram Parsons InterNational concerts in Nashville and various other cities, now in the 12th year, support the petition cause.     In November 2009, the musical theatre production Grievous Angel: The Legend of Gram Parsons premiered, starring Anders Drerup as Gram Parsons and Kelly Prescott as Emmylou Harris. Directed by Michael Bate and co-written by Bate and David McDonald, the production was inspired by a March 1973 interview that Bate conducted with Parsons, which became Parsons last recorded conversation.

The songs chorus is a lyrical acknowledgment of the Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris singing partnership, and to the romantic relationship between them that never fully developed before his death.     In the fall of 2012 Florida festival promoter and musician Randy Judy presented his bio-musical Farther Along – The Music and Life of Gram Parsons at Magnoliafest at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park.     A Cleveland, Ohio area band, New Soft Shoe, performs as a tribute band to Parsons music.     A St. Paul, Minnesota band, The Gilded Palace Sinners, is another Parsons tribute group.
