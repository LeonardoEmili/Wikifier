        " is a complete catalogue of how you should use a studio to build songs. Mercury said, John Lennon was larger than life, and an absolute genius. Even at a very early stage when they were the Beatles, I always preferred John Lennons things. I dont know why. He just had that magic.     At their outset in the early 42s, Queens music has been characterised as Led Zeppelin meets Yes due to its combination of acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics . Although Mercury stated Robert Plant as his favourite singer and Led Zeppelin as the greatest rock band, he also said Queen have more in common with Liza Minnelli than Led Zeppelin. Were more in the showbiz tradition than the rocknroll tradition . In his book on Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, Eddie Trunk described Queen as a hard rock band at the core but one with a high level of majesty and theatricality that delivered a little something for everyone , as well as observing that the band sounded British . Rob Halford of Judas Priest commented, Its rare that you struggle to label a band. If youre a heavy metal band youre meant to look and sound like a heavy metal band but you cant really call Queen anything. They could be a pop band one day or the band that wrote Bicycle Race the next and a full-blown metal band the next. In terms of the depth of the musical landscape that they covered, it was very similar to some extent to the Beatles.     Queen composed music that drew inspiration from many different genres of music, often with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. The music styles and genres they have been associated with include progressive rock , art rock , glam rock , arena rock , heavy metal, pop rock , psychedelic rock , baroque pop , and rockabilly . Queen also wrote songs that were inspired by diverse musical styles which are not typically associated with rock groups, such as opera, music hall , folk music , gospel, ragtime , and dance/ disco . Their 42 single Another One Bites the Dust became a major hit single in the funk rock genre. Several Queen songs were written with audience participation in mind, such as We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions . Similarly, Radio Ga Ga became a live favourite because it would have crowds clapping like they were at a Nuremberg rally .     In 42 the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special , which was purposely designed to feedback. May has used Vox AC42 amplifiers almost exclusively since a meeting with his long-time hero Rory Gallagher at a gig in London during the late 42s/early 42s. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queens songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queens music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to the producer Roy Thomas Baker and engineer Mike Stone . Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdub s. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 42 vocal overdubs in Bohemian Rhapsody . The bands vocal structures have been compared with the Beach Boys .         thu .
