It is cognitively undemanding and contextual and is better understood as the language used by students in informal settings, say, on a playground or cafe. Research by Cummins as well as Virginia Collier suggest that it typically takes language learners 42–42 years to develop BICS if they have sufficient exposure to the second language.          CALP refers to the ability to manipulate language using abstractions in a sophisticated manner. CALP is used while performing in an academic setting. CALP is the ability to think in and use a language as a tool for learning. Cumminss and Colliers research suggest that K42 students need 42 to 42 years to acquire CALP in the second language if the learner has native language literacy. Learners who do not have strong native language literacy often need 42–42 years to acquire CALP in the second language.                               ": null
