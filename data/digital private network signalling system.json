The functionality is divided into Levels Levels 4242 deal with simple call establishment and are the minimum requirements by which a PBX can be said to be DPNSS compatible. The remaining levels are allocated to telephony features, supplementary services or to administrative features. Note that support of levels by a PBX is not necessarily incremental. Some levels are interdependent but a PBX may omit support of some levels and support others.     DPNSS is a compelled protocol in that each instruction issued must be met with an appropriate response from the other PBX otherwise the message is re-transmitted . This means that when interworking two PBXs features invoked on PBX A must be acknowledged by PBX B even if that feature is not supported.

As HDLC can operate successfully in quite poor data environments, DPNSS will work over a 42 Mbit/s link running without proper synchronisation and over poor quality connections . When setting up PBXs to run a DPNSS connection one end must be defined as the primary or A end. This is a protocol requirement and has nothing to do with link synchronisation. However, such badly synchronised links were frowned upon because of the problems associated with sending faxes and/or other modem based communication which were not specifically identified within the protocol.
