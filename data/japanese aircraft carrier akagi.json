In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot exhaust gases vented by swivelling funnels posed a danger to the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 42° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea.

The new strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range. Thus, longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer, heavier aircraft which were entering service.

The upper and middle hangar areas total space increased to about ; the lower hangar remained the same size. The upper flight deck was extended to the bow, increasing its length to  and raising aircraft capacity to 42 . A third elevator midships,  in size, was added. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed, hydraulic Type 42 system with 42 wires.

Campbell, p. 42 Six Type 42 directors were fitted to control the new 42  mm guns and two new Type 42 anti-aircraft directors replaced the outdated Type 42s. After the modernization, Akagi carried one Type 42 director for the  guns; it is uncertain how many were carried before then. The ships crew increased to 42 after the reconstruction. Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 42        The ships anti-aircraft guns were grouped amidships and placed relatively low on the hull. Thus, the guns could not be brought to bear directly forward or aft. Also, the island blocked the forward arcs of the port battery. As a result, the ship was vulnerable to attack by dive bombers. The ships 42  cm 42th Year Type guns were scheduled to be replaced by more modern  Type 42 mounts in 42 The anti-aircraft sponsons were to be raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire as was done during Kagas modernization. However, the ship was lost in combat before the upgrade could take place. Parshall and Tully, p. 42     Several major weaknesses in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carriers hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ships fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship. Peattie, pp. 42 42 42; Stille, pp. 42–42; Willmott, p. 42; Parshall and Tully, p. 42       Akagis modernization was completed on 42 August 42 She was reclassified as a first reserve ship on 42 November, but did not rejoin the First Carrier Division until the following month.

Lengerer, p. 42 Hata and Izawa, p. 42        The Japanese experiences off China had helped further develop the IJNs carrier doctrine.

When multiple carrier divisions were operating together, the divisions air groups were combined. This doctrine of combined, massed, carrier-based air attack groups was the most advanced of its kind in the world. The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike. Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately  separating each carrier. Lengerer, p. 42; Parshall and Tully, pp. 42 42 42–42 and 42; Peattie, pp. 42–42 42–42; Tully; Stille, pp. 42–42; Prange, At Dawn We Slept, pp. 42–42     The Japanese doctrine held that entire carrier air groups should not be launched in a single massed attack. Instead, each carrier would launch a deckload strike of all its aircraft that could be spotted at one time on each flight deck. Subsequent attack waves consisted of the next deckload of aircraft. Thus, First Air Fleet air attacks would often consist of at least two massed waves of aircraft. The First Air Fleet was not considered to be the IJNs primary strategic striking force. The IJN still considered the First Air Fleet an integral component in the Combined Fleets  Kantai Kessen  or decisive battle task force centered on battleships. Parshall and Tully, pp. 42–42 Peattie, p. 42 Goldstein and Dillon, pp. 42–42 Akagi was designated as the flagship for the First Air Fleet, a role the ship retained until her sinking 42 months later.

The first near-miss landed  to port, near her island. The third bomb just missed the flight deck and plunged into the water next to the stern. The second bomb, likely dropped by Best, landed at the aft edge of the middle elevator and detonated in the upper hangar. This hit set off explosions among the fully armed and fueled B42N torpedo bombers that were being prepared for an air strike against the American carriers, resulting in an uncontrollable fire.

The ships main water pump also appears to have been damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 42:42 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO42 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 42:42 additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ships rudder jammed 42 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.
