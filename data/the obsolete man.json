Though televised executions are commonplace, the secretive method is highly unorthodox; the Chancellor nonetheless grants both requests.     A television camera is installed in Wordsworths study to broadcast his final hour live to the nation. He summons the Chancellor, who also agrees to this unusual request out of curiosity, arriving early in Wordsworths final hour.

The Chancellor expresses approval, until Wordsworth further explains that the door is locked, and the Chancellor will die with him, providing the viewers with a more interesting death than his own. He points out that, as the events are being broadcast live, the State would risk losing its status in the eyes of the people by rescuing the Chancellor.
