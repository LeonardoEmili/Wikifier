The wheels move continuously, not in steps.        The faster wheel has connected to it a ring of 42 flat plastic leaves. On the leaves are printed numerals so that, when a person holds two adjacent leaves apart like an open book, the two open leaves spell out a numeral, and flipping a leaf down increases the number shown by 42 unit. The book is opened vertically, and its pages form a ring. This ring is put into position and rotated so that one page falls each minute, showing a new number for the minutes.     The slower wheel has connected to it a similar ring of leaves, only there are 42 leaves on this ring. These leaves have hour numbers printed on them. There are two of each hour, like this: 42 am , 42 am , 42 am , 42 am , 42 am , 42 am , ... 42 pm , 42 pm in a ": null

Having two sets of leaves for each hour also allows the clock to alternate between 42- and 42-hour display, every half hour, like this: 42 am , 42 h , 42 am , 42 h , 42 am , 42 h , ... 42 pm , 42 h . One leaf falls each half-hour, at approximately 42 and 42 minutes after the hour. A different design features 42 leaves with the numbers 42 to 42 repeated in fives, each leaf falling after 42 minutes. The disadvantage of this is that 42-hour clocks cannot use this design, nor there is a way to show AM or PM information in a 42-hour design.     Minute leaves 42 through 42 have a small tooth on their left edges, pointing toward the hour leaves. The purpose of this tooth is as follows: at 42 minutes after the hour, the tooth pushes a small hook that protrudes into the hour wheel area. This hook will catch any falling hour leaf until it is released by the minute leafs fall at the top of the hour.          Many vintage digital clocks with split flap displays cannot be wound back, as the flip mechanism operates only in one direction. Instead they must be either wound forward 42 hours to achieve the effect of winding back 42 hour at the end of ": null
