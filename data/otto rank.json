But that some people are happy, others unhappy, some afraid, or full of anger, and some loving and affectionate – read the case histories to find how such differences between people were then absent from the literature.     All emotional experience by human beings was being reduced by analysis to a derivative, no matter how disguised, of libido. For Freud, emotion was always sexual, derived from a dangerous Id that must be surgically uprooted: Where Id was Wo es war, Freud said famously, there ego shall be soll ich werden .     Libido, according to Freuds 42 work on  Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego  , is an expression taken from the theory of the emotions. Emotion is the cause of neurotic disorder.

        " of the patient, like the draining of the Zuyder Zee . The analyst makes the unconscious conscious by providing cognitive insight to the patient, thereby subduing the pressing drive for the irrational, for emotions – for the Id – to emerge from the patients unconscious.          In a 42 lecture, Rank observes that surgical therapy is uprooting and isolates the individual emotionally, as it tries to deny the emotional life , the same attack he and Ferenczi had leveled against psychoanalytic practice in their joint work. Reducing all emotional experience—all feeling, loving, thinking, and willing—to sex was one of Freuds biggest mistakes, according to Rank, who first pointed out this confusion in the mid-twenties. Emotions, said Rank, are relationships. Denial of the emotional life leads to denial of the will, the creative life, as well as denial of the interpersonal relationship in the analytic situation .     For Freud, said Rank in Will Therapy , the emotional life develops from the sexual sphere, therefore his sexualization in reality means emotionalization , two experiences that psychoanalysts continued to conflate for half a century after Freuds death. Until the end of the 42th century, psychoanalysis had no theory of emotional experience and, by extension, no theory of emotional intelligence. Weinstein identified over two dozen articles in the major psychoanalytic journals lamenting the absence of a theory of emotions. ch comments persisted through to the 42s .     The emotional impoverishment of psychoanalysis, wrote Ernest Becker in The Denial of Death, which was strongly influenced by Ranks ideas, must extend also to many analysts themselves and to psychiatrists who come under its ideology. This fact helps explain the terrible deadness of emotion that one experiences in psychiatric settings, the heavy weight of the character armor erected against the world .     Written privately in 42 Ferenczis Clinical Diary identified the personal causes for the erroneous development of psychoanalysis . According to Ferenczi, … One learned from and from his kind of technique various things that made ones life and work more comfortable: the calm, unemotional reserve; the unruffled assurance that one knows better; and the theories, the seeking and finding of the causes of failure in the patient instead of partly in ourselves … and finally the pessimistic view, shared only with a few, that neurotics are a rabble Gesindel, good only to support us financially and to allow us to learn from their cases: psychoanalysis as a therapy may be worthless .     But terrified at the prospect of losing Freuds approval, Ferenczi aborted his enthusiasm for The Trauma of Birth and began to distance himself personally from Rank – whom he shunned during a chance meeting in 42 at Penn Station in New York. He was my best friend and he refused to speak to me, Rank said .     Ferenczis rupture with Rank cut short radical innovations in practice, and left no one in the inner circle who would champion relational, pre-Oedipal or here-and-now psychotherapy. Classical psychoanalysis, along the lines of Freuds 42–42 technical writings, would now be entrenched in training institutes around the world. The attack leveled in 42 by Ferenczi and Rank on the increasing fanaticism for interpretation and the unnatural elimination of all human factors from the practice of analysis would be forgotten.

Rank, she observes, helped her move back and forth between what she could verbalize in her journals and what remained unarticulated. She discovered the quality and depth of her feelings in the wordless transitions between what she could say and what she could not say. As he talked, I thought of my difficulties with writing, my struggles to articulate feelings not easily expressed. Of my struggles to find a language for intuition, feeling, instincts which are, in themselves, elusive, subtle, and wordless .     According to Rank, all feelings are grounded in the present. In Will Therapy, published in German in 42–42 Rank uses the term here and now for the first time in the psychotherapeutic literature: Freud made the repression historical, that is, misplaced it into the childhood of the individual and then wanted to release it from there, while as a matter of fact the same tendency is working here and now . Instead of the word Verdrängung , which laid stress on unconscious repression of the past, Rank preferred to use the word Verleugnung , which focused instead on the emotional will to remain ill in the present: The neurotic lives too much in the past to that extent he actually does not live. He suffers … because he clings to wants to cling to it, in order to protect himself from experience Erlebnis, the emotional surrender to the present .

According to Ervin Polster , a pre-eminent Gestalt therapist, Rank brought the human relationship directly into his office. He influenced analysts to take seriously the actual present interaction between therapist and patient, rather than maintain the fixed, distant, as though relationship that had given previous analysts an emotional buffer for examining the intensities of therapeutic sensation and wish. Ranks contributions opened the way for encounter to become accepted as a deep therapeutic agent .     Rank affected the practice of action-oriented and reflective therapies such as dramatic role-playing and psychodrama. Although there is no evidence of a direct influence, Ranks ideas found new life in the work of such action psychotherapists as Moreno, who developed a psychodrama technique of doubling ... and Landy who attempted to conceptualize balance as an integration of role and counterrole .       Rank was the first to see therapy as a learning and unlearning experience. The therapeutic relationship allows the patient to: learn more creative ways of thinking, feeling and being in the here-and-now; and unlearn self-destructive ways of thinking, feeling and being in the here-and-now. Patterns of self-destruction represent a failure of creativity not, as Freud assumed, a retreat from sexuality.     Ranks psychology of creativity has recently been applied to ": null

The process of stepping out of a frame, out of a form of knowing – a prevailing ideology – is analogous to the work of artists as they struggle to give birth to fresh ways of seeing the world, perspectives that allow them to see aspects of the world that no artists, including themselves, have ever seen before.

Their greatness consists precisely in this reaching out beyond themselves, beyond the ideology which they have themselves fostered, according to Art and Artist . Through the lens of Otto Ranks work on understanding art and artists, transformative action learning can be seen as the never-completed process of learning how to step out of the frame of the ruling mindset, whether ones own or the cultures – in other words, of learning how to unlearn.     Comparing the process of unlearning to the breaking out process of birth, Rank was the first psychologist to suggest that a continual capacity to separate from internal mental objects – from internalized institutions, beliefs and neuroses; from the restrictions of culture, social conformity and received wisdom – is the sine qua non for lifelong creativity.     In a 42 lecture, Rank said: Life in itself is a mere succession of separations. Beginning with birth, going through several weaning periods and the development of the individual personality, and finally culminating in death – which represents the final separation. At birth, the individual experiences the first shock of separation, which throughout his life he strives to overcome. In the process of adaptation, man persistently separates from his old self, or at least from those segments off his old self that are now outlived. Like a child who has outgrown a toy, he discards the old parts of himself for which he has no further use ….The ego continually breaks away from its worn-out parts, which were of value in the past but have no value in the present. The neurotic is unable to accomplish this normal detachment process … Owing to fear and guilt generated in the assertion of his own autonomy, he is unable to free himself, and instead remains suspended upon some primitive level of his evolution .     Rank also redefined the concept of ": null

Unlearning necessarily involves separation from ones self-concept, as it has been culturally conditioned to conform to familial, group, occupational or organizational allegiances. According to Rank , unlearning or breaking out of our shell from the inside is a separation is so hard, not only because it involves persons and ideas that one reveres, but because the victory is always, at bottom, and in some form, won over a part of ones ego .     In the organizational context, learning how to unlearn is vital because what we assume to be true has merged into our identity. We refer to the identity of an individual as a mindset. We refer to the identity of an organizational group as a culture. Action learners learn how to question, probe and separate from, both kinds of identity—i.e., their individual selves and their social selves. By opening themselves to critical inquiry, they begin to learn how to emancipate themselves from what they know – they learn how to unlearn.     In 42 the cultural anthropologist ": null

Beckers posthumously published book, Escape from Evil was devoted in large measure to exploring Ranks social psychology rooted in the idea of history as a succession of immortality ideologies. A revised edition of Escape from Evil is now in preparation by Marie Becker and Robert Kramer.     The feeling of anxiety, writes Rank in Will Therapy , divides into two currents, running in opposite directions: one toward separation and individuation; the other toward union and collectivity. The outbreak of neurosis typically comes from the streaming together of these two fears—which Rank also calls the fear of living Lebensangst and the fear of dying Todesangst – which, even in The Trauma of Birth, I had designated as the fear of both going forward and of going backward . A crisis seems to break out at a certain age when the life fear which has restricted the Is development meets with the death fear as it increases with growth and maturity, writes Rank in Will Therapy . The individual then feels himself driven forward by regret for wasted life and the desire to retrieve it. But this forward driving fear is now death fear, the fear of dying without having lived, which, even so, is held in check by fear of life .     The fear of life is the fear of separation and individuation. The fear of death is the fear of union and merger—in essence, the loss of individuality. Both separation and union, however, are desired as well as feared since the will to separate correlates with the creative impulse and the will to unite with the need for love. To respond obsessively just to one need—by choosing to separate totally or to merge totally —is to have the other thrown back at ones self.     According to Rank , Birth fear remains always more universal, cosmic as it were, loss of a connection with a greater whole einen größeren Ganzen, in the last analysis with the All dem All ... The fear in birth, which we have designated as fear of life, seems to me actually the fear of having to live as an isolated individual, and not the reverse, the fear of loss of individuality . That would mean, however, that primary fear Urangst corresponds to a fear of separation from the whole vom All, therefore a fear of individuation, on account of which I would like to call it fear of life, although it may appear later as fear of the loss of this dearly bought individuality as fear of death, of being dissolved again into the whole ins All. Between these two fear possibilities these poles of fear, the individual is thrown back and forth all his life, which accounts for the fact that we have not been able to trace fear back to a single root, or to overcome it therapeutically .     On a microcosmic level, therapy is a process of learning how to give and take, surrender and assert, merge and individuate, unite and separate—without being trapped in a whipsaw of opposites. Therapist and client, like everyone else, seek to find a constructive balance between separation and union. In psychological health, the contact boundary that links I and Thou harmoniously the edges of each without confusing them, Rank wrote in Art and Artist . Joining together in feeling, therapist and client do not lose themselves but, rather, re-discover and re-create themselves. In the simultaneous dissolution of their difference in a greater whole, therapist and client surrender their painful isolation for a moment, only to have individuality returned to them in the next, re-energized and enriched by the experience of loss.     e love feeling, Rank observes in a lecture delivered in 42 at the University of Pennsylvania, unites our I with the other, with the Thou dem Du, with men, with the world, and so does away with fear. What is unique in love is that—beyond the fact of uniting—it rebounds on the I. Not only, I love the other as my I, as part of my I, but the other also makes my I worthy of love. The love of the Thou des Liebe des Du thus places a value on ones own I. Love abolishes egoism, it merges the self in the other to find it again enriched in ones own I. This unique projection and introjection of feeling rests on the fact that one can really only love the one who accepts our own self unser eigene Selbst as it is, indeed will not have it otherwise than it is, and whose self we accept as it is.     On a macrocosmic level, taking the experience of love as far as humanly possible, to the boundary of the spiritual, Rank compared the artists giving and the enjoyers finding of art with the dissolution and rediscovery of the self in mutual love. The art-work, says Rank in Art and artist, presents a unity, alike in its effect and in its creation, and this implies a spiritual unity between the artist and the recipient . It is in art, and its correlative, love, that microcosm meets macrocosm, the human meets the spiritual. At the height of the individuating impulse, the will to separate, artists feel most strongly the longing for attachment, the will to unite. Although artists begin the creative process by separating from their fellow human beings and liberating themselves from conforming to the past, escaping from the anxiety of influence, eventually the creative impulse merges into a desire for a return to a greater whole, to the ALL – in human terms, to the collective that alone has the power to immortalize the artist with the approval it grants the artwork:     For this very essence of man, his soul, which the artist puts into his work and which is represented by it, is found again in the work by the enjoyer, just as the believer finds his soul in religion or in God, with whom he feels himself to be one. It is on this identity of the spiritual ... and not on a psychological identification with the artist that ultimately depends... But both of them, in the simultaneous dissolution of their individuality in a greater whole, enjoy, as a high pleasure, the personal enrichment of that individuality through this feeling of oneness. They have yielded up their mortal ego for a moment, fearlessly and even joyfully, to receive it back in the next, the richer for this universal feeling .     In one of his most poetic passages, Rank suggests that this transcendent feeling implies not only a spiritual unity between artist and enjoyer, I and Thou, but also with a Cosmos floating in mystic vapors in which present, past, and future are dissolved – an identity with the ALL that once was but is no more. The healing nature of artistic experience, Rank believed, affirms difference but, paradoxically, also leads to the release from difference, to the feeling of unity with the self, with the other, with the cosmos . In art, microcosm meets macrocosm. Of the uncanny feeling of emotional unity we experience in surrendering ourselves—giving up temporarily the burden of our difference—to the Other in art, Rank writes in Art and Artist: produces a satisfaction which suggests that it is more than a matter of the passing identification of two individuals, that it is the potential restoration of a union with the Cosmos, which once existed and was then lost. The individual psychological root of this sense of unity I discovered  in the prenatal condition, which the individual in his yearning for immortality strives to restore. Already, in that earliest stage of individualization, the child is not only factually one with the mother but beyond that, one with the world, with a Cosmos floating in mystic vapors in which present, past, and future are dissolved. The individual urge to restore this lost unity is an essential factor in the production of human cultural values .     No one has expressed the conflict between the will to separate and the will to unite better than Ernest Becker , whose award-winning The Denial of Death captured the largest—macrocosmic—meaning of separation and union for Rank: On the one hand the creature is impelled by a powerful desire to identify with the cosmic forces, to merge himself with the rest of nature. On the other hand he wants to be unique, to stand out as something different and apart . You can see that man wants the impossible: He wants to lose his isolation and keep it at the same time. He cant stand the sense of separateness, and yet he cant allow the complete suffocation of his vitality. He wants to expand by merging with the powerful beyond that transcends him, yet he wants while merging with it to remain individual and aloof ... .     On a microcosmic level, however, the lifelong oscillation between the two poles of fear can be made more bearable, according to Rank, in a relationship with another person who accepts ones uniqueness and difference, and allows for the emergence of the creative impulse—without too much guilt or anxiety for separating from the other. Living fully requires seeking at once isolation and union , finding the courage to accept both simultaneously, without succumbing to the Angst that leads a person to be whipsawed from one pole to the other. Creative solutions for living emerge from the fluctuating, ever-expanding and ever-contracting, space between separation and union. Art and the creative impulse, said Rank in Art and Artist, originate solely in the constructive harmonization of this fundamental dualism of all life .     On a macrocosmic level, the consciousness of living—the dim awareness that we are alive for a moment on this planet as it spins, meaninglessly, around the cold and infinite galaxy—gives human beings the status of a small god in nature, according to Ernest Becker: Yet, at the same time, as the Eastern sages also knew, man is a worm and food for worms. This is the paradox: he is out of nature and hopelessly in it; he is dual, up in the stars and yet housed in a heart-pumping, breath-gasping body that once belonged to a fish and still has the gill marks to prove it ... Man is literally split in two: he has awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumbly to rot and disappear forever. It is a terrifying dilemma to be in and to have to live with .

In 42 the philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone published The Roots of Morality , which contains an analysis of Ranks argument that immortality ideologies are an abiding human response to the painful riddle of death. Sheets-Johnstone compares Ranks thought to that of three major Western philosophers—René Descartes, Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida: Because immortality ideologies were originally recognized and in fact so named by Rank, a close examination of his writings on the subject is not only apposite but is itself philosophically rewarding ... Rank was a Freudian dissident who, in introducing the concept of immortality ideologies, traced out historical and psychological roots of soul-belief ... points up the extraordinary cogency of Ranks distinction between the rational and the irrational to the question of the human need for immortality ideologies . Sheets-Johnstone concludes her book on a note reminiscent of Ranks plea for the human value of mutual love over arid intellectual insight: Surely it is time for Homo sapiens sapiens to turn away from the pursuit of domination over all and to begin cultivating and developing its sapiential wisdom in the pursuit of caring, nurturing and strengthening that most precious muscle which is its heart .
