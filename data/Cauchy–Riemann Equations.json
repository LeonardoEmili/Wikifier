        ".     Moreover, because the composition of a conformal transformation with another conformal transformation is also conformal, the composition of a solution of the Cauchy–Riemann equations with a conformal map must itself solve the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Thus the Cauchy–Riemann equations are conformally invariant.       Suppose that     : f u + i \\cdot v     is a function of a complex number z. Then the complex derivative of f at a point z 0 is defined by     : \\lim_ \\frac f     provided this limit exists.     If this limit exists, then it may be computed by taking the limit as h  → 0 along the real axis or imaginary axis; in either case it should give the same result. Approaching along the real axis, one finds     : \\lim_ \\frac \\frac.     On the other hand, approaching along the imaginary axis,     : \\lim_ \\frac \\frac\\frac.     The equality of the derivative of f taken along the two axis is     : i\\frac\\frac,     which are the Cauchy–Riemann equations at the point  z 0 .     Conversely, if f  : ℂ  →  ℂ is a function which is differentiable when regarded as a function on ℝ 2 , then f is complex differentiable if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold. In other words, if u and v are real-differentiable functions of two real variables, obviously u + iv is a real-differentiable function, but u + iv is complex-differentiable if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold.     Indeed, following , suppose f is a complex function defined in an open set Ω  ⊂ ℂ. Then, writing  for every z  ∈ Ω, one can also regard Ω as an open subset of ℝ 2 , and f as a function of two real variables x and y, which maps Ω  ⊂ ℝ 2 to ℂ. We consider the Cauchy–Riemann equations at z   z 0 . So assume f is differentiable at z 0 , as a function of two real variables from Ω to ℂ. This is equivalent to the existence of the following linear approximation     : f - f f_x \\,\\Delta x + f_y \\,\\Delta y + \\eta \\,\\Delta z \\,     where z x + iy and η → 0 as Δz → 0. Since \\Delta z + \\Delta \\bar 2 \\, \\Delta x and \\Delta z - \\Delta \\bar2i \\, \\Delta y , the above can be re-written as     : \\Delta f \\frac \\, \\Delta z + \\frac \\, \\Delta \\bar + \\eta \\, \\Delta z\\,     Defining the two ": null

Now consider the potential values of d\\bar/dz when the limit is taken at the origin. For z along the real line, \\bar z so that d\\bar/dz 1 . Similarly for purely imaginary z we have d\\bar/dz -1 so that the value of d\\bar/dz is not well defined at the origin. Its easy to verify that d\\bar/dz is not well defined at any complex z, hence f is complex differentiable at z 0 if and only if 0 at zz_0 . But this is exactly the Cauchy–Riemann equations, thus f is differentiable at z 0 if and only if the Cauchy–Riemann equations hold at  z 0 .
