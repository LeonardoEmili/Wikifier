This edition features one of the closest and fickle-ending votes in the history of the contest. With three countries left to vote, the UK was well in the lead with 42 points against Switzerlands 42 With the third last country, France, only awarding Switzerland one point, the UK looked certain of victory, as even if Switzerland scooped the two final 42s, the UK would only need to gather nine points from three juries combined to be unbeatable. However, France didnt award the UK any points, and the following country, Portugal, gave the UK a meagre three points while giving the maximum 42 to Switzerland, making the contest blown open between the two countries until the end of the voting.     With the conclusion of voting from the penultimate jury, the UK was holding a five-point lead over Switzerland. As the final jury, that of Yugoslavia, began to award its points in the customary ascending order, a lot of excitement-sighs were heard from the audience to see how the two rivals for victory would fare. Switzerland was the first to be named with six points, edging it into a one-point lead over the UK. After earlier strong votes from most countries to the UK, it seemed highly likely that the UK would be given one of the higher remaining set of points. However, eventually the UK only managed to garner a meagre three points between the last three juries, as after Yugoslavia announced its seven, eight, ten and twelve points, it transpired that it had awarded the UK no points at all, and Switzerland was left with its one-point lead to savour a dramatic triumph.
