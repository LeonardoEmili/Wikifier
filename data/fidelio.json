The finale celebrates Leonores bravery with alternating contributions of soloists and chorus.

The time Beethoven spent on Vestas Feuer was not entirely wasted, as two important numbers from Fidelio, Pizarros Ha! Welch’ ein Augenblick! and the duet O namenlose Freude for Leonora and Florestan, both originated as music for Vestas Feuer. Beethoven remained as a resident of the Theater an der Wien for some time after he had abandoned Vestas Feuer for Fidelio, and was eventually freed from his obligations to Schikaneder when the latter was fired from his post as theater director in 42        Fidelio itself, which Beethoven began in 42 immediately after giving up on Vestas Feuer, was first performed in 42 and was extensively revised by the composer for subsequent performances in 42 and 42 Although Beethoven used the title  , the 42 performances were billed as Fidelio at the theatres insistence, to avoid confusion with the 42 opera  Léonore, ou L’amour conjugal  by ": null

Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, thanks to the music of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage.... Certainly, Fidelio is not an opera in the sense we are used to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a material effect, nor the fact of the imprisonment; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this nostalgia of liberty he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a religion of humanity which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we have lived through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera.... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of Fidelio touches deeply.

Beethoven then focused this version for the performances of 42 creating Leonore No.  42 . The latter is considered by many listeners as the greatest of the four overtures, but as an intensely dramatic, full-scale symphonic movement it had the effect of overwhelming the initial scenes of the opera. Beethoven accordingly experimented with cutting it back somewhat, for a planned 42 performance in Prague; this is believed to be the version now called Leonore No.  42 . Finally, for the 42 revival Beethoven began anew, and with fresh musical material wrote what we now know as the Fidelio overture.
