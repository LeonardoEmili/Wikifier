Defining the array manifold as the complex response of the \\mathrm element antenna array as \\mathrm , where \\mathrm is a matrix with \\mathrm rows, the beam pattern is first computed as:     : \\mathrm \\frac\\mathrm^\\mathrm     where \\mathrm^ is the conjugate transpose of \\mathrm at the reference angle \\theta_ .
