They theorize that a decrease in the content of hemicellulose, crystallization of cellulose, and changes to lignin over time all result in its wood gaining better resonating properties.        Steel-string acoustic guitars are commonly constructed in several body types, varying in size, depth, and proportion. In general, the guitars soundbox can be thought of as composed of two mating chambers: the upper bouts  on the neck end of the body, and lower bouts . These meet at the waist, or the narrowest part of the body face near the soundhole. The proportion and overall size of these two parts helps determine the overall tonal balance and native sound of a particular body style – the larger the body, the louder the volume.     The 00, double-O or grand concert body type is the major body style most directly derived from the classical guitar. It has the thinnest soundbox and the smallest overall size, making it very comfortable to play but lacking in projection -volume - relative to the larger types. Its smaller size makes it suitable for younger or smaller-framed players. It is commonly called a parlor steel , as it is well-suited to smaller rooms. ": null

Many 000-style guitars also have a convex back to increase the physical volume of the soundbox without making it deeper at the edges, which would affect comfort and playability. The result is a very balanced tone, comparable to the 00 but with greater volume and dynamic range and slightly more low-end response, making this Classically shaped body style very popular. ": null
