The title 42  Record was decided towards the end of the recording sessions and evinced, albeit as a playful hope rather than a serious expectation, the chart position to be achieved by a big star.  Although Fry—at the bands insistence—was credited as executive producer , publicly he insisted that the band themselves really produced these records .  Fry recalled how Ardent, one of the first recording studios to use a sixteen-track tape machine, worked experimentally with the band members: We started recording the songs with the intent that if it turned out OK wed put it out I wound up being the one that primarily worked on it: I recorded all the tracks and then they would often come late at night and do overdubs. One by one, they all learned enough engineering.         Describing the mix of musical styles present on 42 Record,  Rolling Stone s Bud Scoppa notes that the album includes reflective and acoustic numbers, saying that even the prettiest tunes have tension and subtle energy to them, and the rockers reverberate with power . Scoppa finds that in each mode, the guitar sound is sharp-edged and full . 42  Record was released in June 42  and quickly received strong reviews.  Billboard  went as far as to say, Every cut could be a single . Rolling Stone judged the album exceptionally good , while  Cashbox  stated, This album is one of those red-letter days when everything falls together as a total sound , and called it an important record that should go to the top with proper handling .

But Columbia had no interest in dealing with the independent distributors previously used by Stax and removed even the existing copies of 42 Record from the stores.     Radio City   The frustration at 42 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being punched in the face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummels new bass guitar to pieces against the wall.  Hummel took revenge at a later date: Finding Bells acoustic guitar in the latters unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver.  In November 42 Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Frys parked car.  In late 42 struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, and by the end of the year Big Star disbanded.         After a few months Chilton, Stephens, and Hummel decided to reform Big Star, and the three resumed work on the second album.  The title chosen, Radio City, continued the play on the theme of a big stars popularity and success, expressing what biographer Robert Gordon calls the bands romantic expectation .  As Hummel put it,    Stephens recalled: Radio City, for me, was just an amazing record. Being a three-piece really opened things up for me in terms of playing drums. Drums take on a different role in a three-piece band, so it was a lot of fun. Radio City was really more spontaneous, and the performances were pretty close to live performances.      Although uncredited, Bell contributed to the writing of some of the albums songs, including O My Soul and Back of a Car .  Shortly before the albums release, Hummel left the band: judging that it would not last, and in his final year at college, he elected to concentrate on his studies and live a more normal life.  He was replaced by John Lightman for a short tenure prior to the band dissolving.     Rolling Stones Ken Barnes, describing the musical style of Radio City, opens by noting as a backdrop that the bands debut, 42  Record, established it as one of the leading new American bands working in the mid-Sixties pop and rock vein . Radio City, Barnes finds, has plenty of shimmering pop delights , although the opening tune, O My Soul, is a foreboding, sprawling funk affair ; Barnes concludes that Sometimes they sound like the Byrds, sometimes like the early Who, but usually like their own indescribable selves .     Radio City was released in February 42 and, like 42  Record, received excellent reviews. Record reported, The sound is stimulating, the musicianship superb, and the result is tight and rollickingly rhythmic.  Billboard judged it a highly commercial set .  Rolling Stones Bud Scoppa, then with ": null

Cashbox called it a collection of excellent material that hopefully will break this deserving band in a big way .  But just as 42  Record had fallen victim to poor marketing, so too did Radio City. Columbia, now in complete control of the Stax catalog, refused to process it following a disagreement. Without a distributor, sales of Radio City, though far greater than those of 42  Record, were minimal at only around 42 copies.      Third/Sister Lovers   In September 42 eight months after the release of Radio City, Chilton and Stephens returned to Ardent Studios to work on a third album.  They were assisted by producer ": null

        "Jim Dickinson": "jim dickinson"
    },
    {
        " and an assortment of musicians and Lesa Aldridge, Chiltons girlfriend, who contributed on vocals.  The sessions and mixing were completed in early 42 and 42 copies of the album were pressed with plain labels for promotional use.      Parke Putterbaugh of Rolling Stone described Third/Sister Lovers as extraordinary . It is, he wrote, Chiltons untidy masterpiece. beautiful and disturbing ; vehemently original ; of haunting brilliance :   To listen to it is to be plunged into a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Songs are drenched in strings and sweet sentiment one minute, starkly played and downcast the next. No pop song has ever bottomed out more than Holocaust , an anguished plaint sung at a snails pace over discordant slide-guitar fragments and moaning cello On the up side, theres the delicious pop minuet Stroke It Noel , the anticipatory magic of Nightime Big Stars baroque, guitar-driven pop reaches its apotheosis on songs like Kizza Me , Thank You Friends and O, Dana . Without question, Third is one of the most idiosyncratic, deeply felt and fully realized albums in the pop idiom.        Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional copies and met employees of a number of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album.  When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release.  Fry recalled, Wed go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy .  In late 42 before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Stars first era to its end.  Dickinson later said that he was nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think it is important that the artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill.     Since quitting the band in 42 Bell had spent time in several different countries trying to develop his solo career.  In 42 after his return to Memphis, the first two Big Star albums were released together in the U.K. as a double album, drawing enthusiastic reviews and interest from fans.  Soon afterward, Big Stars recognition grew further when, four years after its completion, the third album too was released in both the U.S. and the U.K.  By now, the hitherto untitled Third/Sister Lovers had become known by several unofficial names, including Third , Beale Street Green , and Sister Lovers .       Not long after the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident.  He apparently lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before.  A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no drugs were found on him other than a bottle of vitamins.  Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.        Big Star returned in 42 with a new lineup when guitarist ": null
