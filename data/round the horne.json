When the BBC refused to withdraw Horne from the programme Down with Women, Merriman resigned from writing Beyond Our Ken and the show came to an end.

The character was loosely based on the television cook Fanny Cradock.

Among her helpful cooking tips are that although rhinoceros is not very appetising you do get marvellous crackling; her recipes for yak include yak Ã  lorange, yak in its jacket, and coupe yak. She advises followers of female fashion that bosoms are still out, but may be on the way back and her other useful pointers include how to use cold cream to remove those baboon claw marks from ones hip, and how to avoid crows feet round the eyes: refrain from sleeping in trees.

Seamus Android was the only regular character played by Pertwee, who was otherwise cast as what Took called the odds and ends â€“ the minor characters and straight parts. Androids interviewees include the much married actress Zsa-Zsa Poltergeist, the Hollywood producer Daryll F. Klaphanger, and the star of The Ipswich File, Michael Bane; promised appearances by such as Lord Ghenghiz Wilkinson, the dancing cloakroom attendant, Nemesis Poston, the juggling monk, and Anthony Wormwood-Nibblo, the Hoxton cat thief and heiress fail to materialise.

The invention of Mortimer and Cooke, Julie Coolibah appears in the fourth season. She is an Australian visiting London, deeply suspicious of British men . Every time she talks to Horne she interprets his innocent remarks as sexual overtures:   :Horne: Good to have you back.   :Julie: What do you mean by that?   :Horne: Nothing, just extending the hand of friendship.   :Julie: Yeah? With what purpose in mind, might I ask?   When Julie manages to find work in London she has constant difficulties coping with the men.

In 42  The Sunday Times  referred to it as One of the best-loved shows of all time.   Punch  commented that the series was probably the last comedy show on radio to have a huge following. According to Took, Round the Horne was broadcast when radio was considered to be on the wane when compared to television; such was the shows popularity, many thought radio would continue to be a leading form of entertainment.     Although Round the Horne attracted some adverse comments from Black, Whitehouse and others of similar views, the show was well received by the press. In 42 The Times called it half an hour of the purest impure entertainment , and as the third series came to an end the paper called for a Christmas special and a further series in the new year. No-one, but no-one at all has yet presented those elegant queens, those touchily vulnerable bona-boys, those fashion fetichists so deftly, so pointedly, and, in the final accounting, so purely . In 42 the paper commented that the show was a success with lovers of the sophisticated pun as well as appealing to those who like a good belly laugh , with obvious jokes  ... mixed with clever word juggling .     In 42 looking back at British radio comedy,  The Guardian  placed Round the Horne first in its list of the five greatest shows. In 42 in a poll run by Radio Times, Round the Horne was voted the third best radio show of any kind, and the best comedy.
