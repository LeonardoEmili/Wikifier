For this French-loaned artistic term, English-language texts variously use as the plural films noirs, films noir and, most prevalently,film noirs. The 42th edition of the standard Merriam-Websters Collegiate Dictionary lists film noirs as the preferred style. Three primary bases may be identified for this:   Unlike other compounds borrowed directly from French, film noir is used to refer primarily to English-language cultural artifacts; a typically English-style plural is thus unusually appropriate.   Again, unlike other foreign-loaned compounds, film noir refers specifically to the products of popular culture; consequently, popular usage holds more orthographical authority than is usual.   English has adopted noir as a stand-alone adjective in artistic contexts, leading it to serve as the lone head in a variety of compounds .
