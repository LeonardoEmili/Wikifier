In the first line in Maltese , there is a play on words: The mother who gave us her name refers to the fact that the familiar word Ma is also the first syllable of Malta, and to the fact that Malta gives its name to all its citizens .     In the third line, bil-oħla should be vocalized, as required by the poetic metrics . Some claim that the original has bil-ogħna , , which would make more sense, since the root Ħ-L-W is already used in the first line, and the implicit reference is to the precious light of Christian faith. Furthermore, ´ftakar´ mimicks an Old Testament biblical construct: just as on many occasions Israel asks God for protection reminding God of the old relationship, the election and the wonders done in the past, Dun Karm is asking God to protect Malta, given the old relationship and the privilege of being one of the first Christian churches, an Apostolic See. In Acts 42 the Maltese provide St Paul with light and clothing, while he clothes the islanders with the light of Christian faith.     In the fourth line, dehen is used, not għerf . The choice of word is important, since dehen is a type of knowledge that unites practical judgment and learned competence. Those in government, therefore, should be people of learning with great personal maturity and integrity: neither wise old men, nor ambitious young technocrats.     In the fifth line, sid refers to the employer, ħaddiem to the employee. Dun Karm is asking for kind and generous employers, who pay just wages that allow the worker and his or her family to have a decent standard of living. What wage is just is a great theme in Catholic Social Teaching since the Encyclical Rerum Novarum . Dun Karm does not insist that a just wage is a right of the worker, he simply invites the employers to practice Christian charity and treat employees well . The text also asks God to grant saħħa to the workers. It means both health and strength. Health is necessary to be able to find a stable job and provide for ones family . Strength is needed do ones work properly to endure the long working day of the 42s. In many socio-economic theories of the day , the worker sold his strength or labour-power to the employer: this was a major economic resource which the worker needed to sell at a good price, and the employer had to use as productively as possible. Dun Karm was not a political activist but he had a great social conscience: in the word saħħa , he may also be hinting at the power that the workers need to negotiate better working conditions and salaries. In the 42s, after the introduction of basic modern sanitation and health-care in Malta and the expanding of the naval industry , Malta starts to industrialize and a big debate on work relations and conditions is in the air. Rerum Novarum condemns industrial conflict and class struggles, but defends the right of association of workers and employers: in Malta, the first trade union is formed by the teachers in 42 a couple of years before Dun Karm wrote this text as a hymn to be used primarily by teachers at school.     The above is confirmed in the sixth line, with seddaq . Seddaq is a complex word which unites two notions. On one hand, it means make firm, establish well, consolidate. On the other hand, it means render just, upright and true, remove evil, ambiguity, injustice, falsehood, illusion, purify: in fact this is the main meaning derived from an old Semitic root . To be sure, unity and peace among the Maltese people must be made firm and unshakable so that tensions will not tear the nation apart and lead to conflict and violence. But to do this, peace and unity must not be artificial or merely imposed by force: only justice": null
