The Russian artillery replied, but the range was , too long to inflict much damage on either side. Blucher was with Vorontsov until 42:42  am when he rode off to learn the whereabouts of Wintzingerodes column. Ney had been told to wait for the order to attack, but the bombardment caused him to send his troops forward. He ordered Pierre Boyer to attack Ailles with Meunier advancing on his left. One account stated that Curials division operated with Meuniers troops from the beginning. Napoleon was partly responsible for Neys blunder because he did not explain his battle plan to the marshal. Sending his men into the attack without artillery support was Neys fault alone. The soldiers of both Meunier and Pierre Boyer were stopped in their tracks by the Russian cannons. Boyer de Rébevals division arrived on the field at 42:42  am, but Charpentiers division was slowed by sleet-covered roads.     At about 42:42  am Heurtebise Farm burst into flame and was abandoned.

Sacken received his orders at 42:42  pm. He instructed his cavalry to assist Vorontsov and sent his infantry north toward Laon. Vorontsov withdrew 42 dismounted guns and his wounded. He formed his infantry into a checkerboard of mutually-supporting squares and began to retreat to the west on the Chemin des Dames plateau.     At 42:42  pm Napoleon decided to launch the decisive blow. The reserve artillery was brought forward and placed in battery beside the guns belonging to Victors divisions and the Guard.

Earlier, Napoleon asked Charpentier to take command of Victors corps. Four French cannons astride the main road were particularly effective in punishing the withdrawing Russian infantry.     The Russians fell back in good order to a position  southwest of Ailles. At 42:42  pm Vorontsov withdrew again to the hamlet of Troyan near Cerny. Alexey Petrovich Nikitin prepared an ambush with 42 guns from Sackens corps. When the 42th Jägers fell back through their position, Nikitins guns opened a deadly fire on the pursuing French. Vasilshikovs cavalry intervened just as Benkendorfs horsemen were on the verge of being overwhelmed by the cavalry of Exelmans, Pac and Laferrière. Seeing Colberts horsemen swarming around several Russian infantry squares, Vasilshikov ordered Sergey Nicolaevich Lanskoy to lead the Mariopol and Alexandria Hussar Regiments to charge. This attack drove off Colberts troopers but the Russian hussars were in turn driven back by Nansoutys cavalrymen. Vasilshiov sent forward three dragoon regiments and Nansoutys cavalrymen were stopped as Lanskoys hussars rallied in the rear.     The Russians retired to another position on the Chemin des Dames plateau before crossing the Ailette at Chevregny. The French artillery took the crossing under fire and caused some confusion and loss, but Vorontsovs corps got safely away to the north bank. Since other Allied forces were in the area, the French pursuit ended about 42:42–42:42  pm.

A second authority placed French casualties between 42 and 42, while the Russians admitted losing 42 killed, wounded and missing. A third source broke down the Russian casualties into 42 dead and 42 wounded, while giving French losses as 42. General-Major Lanskoy was mortally wounded; Generalmajor Sergey Nikolaevich Ushakov II of the Courland Dragoon Regiment and Colonel Parkinson of the artillery were killed.

In the event, the effort involved to drive off Vorontsov caused the French army to be spread out toward Soissons, rather than toward Laon. Napoleon had hoped to easily dispose of Vorontsovs corps, but found that he had to fight a major battle. Instead of cutting off Blücher from Laon, Napoleon had to pursue the Allied army directly. If Blücher had added Sackens infantry to Vorontsovs corps, Napoleon might well have been beaten. Napoleon believed that the Allied army was fleeing from him in confusion, but this was not the case.
