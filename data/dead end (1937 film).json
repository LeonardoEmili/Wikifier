        "s.     At the end of the street is a dock on the East River; to the left are the luxury apartments and to the right are the slums. The Dead End Kids, led by Tommy Gordon , are a gang of street urchins who are already well on the path to a life of petty crime. Members of the gang besides Tommy include, Dippy , Angel , Spit , T.B. , and Milty , the new kid on the block in search of friends. Spit is a bit malicious with a cruel streak and initially bullies the newcomer and takes his pocket change. However, Tommy eventually lets Milty join the gang, and he turns out to be both a loyal and generous friend.     Tommys sister, Drina , dreams of marrying some dashing, rich stranger who will save her and Tommy from this miserable life of poverty and help prevent Tommy from growing up to be a mobster like Hugh Baby Face Martin , who has returned to the neighborhood to visit his mother and childhood girlfriend. Dave Connell , raised on the same street as Martin, recognizes him and warns him to stay away, but Martin contemptuously ignores him. Dave, a frustrated architect who currently works odd jobs, is Drinas childhood friend. He is having an affair with a rich mans mistress, Kay Burton . Although Dave and Kay love each other, they know they cant be together because Dave cannot provide Kay with the kind of lifestyle she desires.     Meanwhile, the kids lure Philip , a rich kid from the apartments, into a cellar where they beat and rob him. When the boys father tries to intervene, Tommy winds up stabbing him in the arm. He escapes the police and goes into hiding.     Martin is subsequently rejected by his mother , who denounces him as a murderer, and repulsed by his ex-girlfriend, Francie , who is now a prostitute and sick . Despondent over the failed visit, he decides to kidnap the rich child for ransom to make the trip back worthwhile. Dave sees Martin and his accomplices planning the kidnapping and again warns him to leave. Martin knifes him and Hunk  pushes him into the river. Managing to pull himself out of the river, Dave pursues the hoodlums, knocking out Hunk and chasing Martin on the rooftops before cornering him on a fire escape. Among a hail of bullets, he manages to mortally wound Martin who falls onto the street below. While on the ground he engages oncoming police officers in a fire fight, shooting a couple before they open fire and kill him.     As the police and a crowd of people gather around Martins body, the doorman  recognizes Spit as being a member of the gang that attacked the rich kids father and identifies him to Officer Mulligan . Spit exonerates himself by informing the police that the man was cut by Tommy, who has returned to say goodbye to Drina before running away.     Meanwhile, Kay approaches Dave asking him to go away with her, using the reward money that he received for killing Martin. Dave refuses, and Kay returns to the man whom she doesnt love, but can provide her with financial security.     Tommy hears of Spits betrayal and tries to give him the mark of the squealer , which is a knife wound across the cheek. Before he can do so, Dave intervenes, and he and Drina convince Tommy to surrender to the police. Dave then offers to use his reward money to pay for Tommys defense. As Drina, Dave, and Tommy leave with Mulligan, the rest of the Dead End Kids meander off into the night, singing If I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly.       ": null

        " as Milton Milty       Dead End was filmed from May 42 through July 42 42     Robert Osborne, film historian, stated that Joel McCrea had a tough time working with Humphrey Bogart, especially during the scene ...on the rooftop, guns ready, and standing very close to each other. During the filming of that scene, McCrea kept flinching and the director William Wyler had to keep doing more takes. Finally, Wyler pulled McCrea aside, and he asked him what was wrong. McCrea, embarrassed to tell him, explained that Bogart kept spitting in his face when he was speaking. Not exactly what Wyler was expecting to hear or to be the problem. Happens with actors more than you can imagine. Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies       The stage directions to the play indicate that Rockefeller Center can be seen in the distance, which would place the location of the pier at approximately 42th Street in Manhattan.

        ", which was and is at that location.     The actual Dead End was the corner of East 42rd Street and the East River. Sutton Place South runs north from East 42rd Street at that corner. The producers of the play and movie made a painstaking effort to recreate that very area in the stage scenery. The River House at the end of East 42rd Street closely resembles the Griswalds house in the play and movie. One can find traces of some of the locales in Dead End in that area, however, the pier and tenements are gone and the Dead End is now part of Sutton Place Park and Exit 42 of FDR Drive.     The official name of the Dead End Kids is on the brick wall in chalk behind the boys as they play cards.This wall and the inscription is shown in several scenes throughout the film. The graffiti reads: East 42rd Place Gang Members Only.   Writing in the New York Times, Carter B. Horsley said of the River House: Erected in 42 when its area still teemed with tenements, it was mocked in the famous and popular 42 movie, Dead End that was Lillian Hellmans adaptation of Sidney Kingsleys play.
