Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, in Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century , take issue with what they consider Denisoffs reductive approach to the history and function of song in social movements. They point out that Denisoff had paid little attention to the song tunes of protest music, considered them strictly subordinate to the texts, a means to the message. It is true that in the highly text-oriented western European song tradition, tunes can be subordinate, interchangeable, and even limited in number , nevertheless, Eyerman and Jamison point out that some of the most effective protest songs gain power through their appropriation of tunes that are bearers of strong cultural traditions. Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century , p. 43. They also note that: There is more to music and movements than can be captured within a functional perspective, such as Denisoffs, which focuses on the use made of music within already-existing movements. Music, and song, we suggest, can maintain a movement even when it no longer has a visible presence in the form of organizations, leaders, and demonstrations, and can be a vital force in preparing the emergence of a new movement. Here the role and place of music needs to be interpreted through a broader framework in which tradition and ritual are understood as processes of identity and identification, as encoded and embodied forms of collective meaning and memory.

A typical performance included the cheikhas accompanied by two to four male instrumentalists playing a gasba and gallal . Rai was considered a rejection of the traditional Algerian music of the time, and the cheikhas . . . used lewd lyrics focusing on the hardships of life facing peasant women in a big city, the pain of love, the lure of alcohol, immigration, and mourning.     By the 1950s, and through the 1960s, male musicians began performing rai music and incorporated the use of what was considered to be modern musical instruments of that time, such as the violin, the accordion, the lute, and the trumpet. As the genre evolved over time, it continued to have associations with political movements and organizations, such as the Algerian Freedom Fighters who rallied against the French occupation. Even after Algeria achieved independence in 1962, Rai continued to have an adverse relationship with the Algerian government, which exerted a tight grip upon its culture.

The next period of protest songs was in the 1990s, with many created by such bands as NRM, Novaje Nieba and others, which led to unspoken prohibition of these musicians.

Despite Lloyds dubious claim about its origins, however, the Cutty Wren was revived and used as a protest song in the 1950s folk revival, an example of the importance of context in determining what may be considered a protest song.

The Digger movement was violently crushed, and so it is not surprising if few overt protest songs associated with it have survived. From roughly the same period, however, songs protesting wars and the human suffering they inflict abound, though such song do not generally explicitly condemn the wars or the leaders who wage them. For example, The Maunding Souldier or The Fruits of Warre is Beggery , framed as a begging appeal from a crippled soldier of the Thirty Years War . V. de Sola Pinto and Allan Edwin Rodway, The Common Muse: An Anthology of Popular British Ballad Poetry, XVth-XXth Century , pp. 148–50. Such songs have been known, strictly speaking, as songs of complaint rather than of protest, since they offered no solution or hint of rebellion against the status quo. For the distinction between songs of complaint and protest songs, see for example, Dick Weisman, Which Side Are You On: An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America , pp. 36–37.     The advent of industrialization in the 18th and early 19th centuries was accompanied by a series of protest movements and a corresponding increase in the number of topical social protest songs and ballads. An important example is The Triumph of General Ludd , which built a fictional persona for the alleged leader of the early 19th century anti-technological Luddite movement in the cloth industry of the north midlands, and which made explicit reference to the Robin Hood tradition. K. Binfield, ed., The Writings of the Luddites , pp. 98–100. A surprising English folk hero immortalized in song is Napoleon Bonaparte , the military figure most often the subject of popular ballads, many of them treating him as the champion of the common working man in songs such as the Bonny Bunch of Roses and Napoleons Dream .

These industrial protest songs were largely ignored during the first English folk revival of the later 19th and early 20th century, which had focused on songs that had been collected in rural areas where they were still being sung and on music education. They were revived in the 1960s and performed by figures such as A. L. Lloyd on his album The Iron Muse . B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music , pp. 32–3.
