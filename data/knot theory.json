Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R 42 upon itself ; these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.     Knots can be described in various ways. Given a method of description, however, there may be more than one description that represents the same knot. For example, a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram. Any given knot can be drawn in many different ways using a knot diagram. Therefore, a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.     A complete algorithmic solution to this problem exists, which has unknown ": null
