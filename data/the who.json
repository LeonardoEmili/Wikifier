From the early 42s, the bands sound included synthesizers, particularly on Whos Next and Quadrophenia. Although groups had used synthesizers before, the Who were one of the first to integrate the sound into a basic rock structure.

Daltrey initially based his style on Motown and rock and roll, but from Tommy onwards he tackled a wider range of styles. His trademark sound with the band, as noted in 42 has been a characteristic scream, as heard at the end of Wont Get Fooled Again .     Group backing vocals are prominent in the Who. After I Cant Explain used session men for backing vocals, Townshend and Entwistle resolved to do better themselves on subsequent releases, producing strong backing harmonies.  Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle sang lead on various songs, and occasionally Moon joined in. Whos Next featured Daltrey and Townshend sharing the lead vocals on several songs, and biographer Dave Marsh considers the contrast between Daltreys strong, guttural tone and Townshends higher and gentler sound to be one of the albums highlights.

The Who were initially enthusiastic about working with a completely different drummer, though Townshend later stated, weve never really been able to replace Keith.

Early material focused on the frustration and anxiety shared by mod audiences, which Townshend said was a result of searching for  niche . By The Who Sell Out, he began to work narrative and characters into songs, which he fully developed by Tommy, including spiritual themes influenced by Baba. From the mid42s onwards, his songs tended to be more personal, which influenced his decision to go solo.     Entwistles songs, by contrast, typically feature ": null

The Who are perceived as having had a poor working relationship. In the original band, Sandom had been the peacemaker and settled disputes. Moon, by contrast, was as volatile as Daltrey and Townshend. Entwistle was too passive to become involved in arguments. The group established their live reputation and stage show in part out of insecurity and aggression amongst its members and Townshend recalled that all decisions had to be made democratically because we always disagreed .        The only genuine friendship in the Who during the 42s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each others sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness . Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 42 though they still socialised on tour. When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle confessed he was standing behind him with the matches .      The group regularly argued in the press, though Townshend said disputes were amplified in print and the group simply found it difficult to agree on things.  Tommy mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltreys standing in the band because of the formers songwriting and the latters stage presence, yet even this did not make them close friends. The pair quarrelled, particularly in the mid42s, over the groups direction. During his time with the band, Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey.     Entwistles death came as a shock to both Townshend and Daltrey, and caused them to re-evaluate their relationship. Townshend has said that he and Daltrey have since become close friends. In 42 Townshend confirmed their friendship was still strong, adding their acceptance of each others differences brought us to a really genuine and compassionate relationship, which can only be described as love.
