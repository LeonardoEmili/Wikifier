There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.  Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism.

The Suda also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotuss time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume  that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.  Further, the Suda is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.

Herodotus would have made his researches known to the larger world through oral recitations to a public crowd. John Marincola writes in his introduction to the Penguin edition of The Histories that there are certain identifiable pieces in the early books of Herodotuss work which could be labeled as performance pieces . These portions of the research seem independent and almost detachable , so that they might have been set aside by the author for the purposes of an oral performance. The intellectual matrix of the 5th  century, Marincola suggests, comprised many oral performances in which philosophers would dramatically recite such detachable pieces of their work. The idea was to criticize previous arguments on a topic and emphatically and enthusiastically insert their own in order to win over the audience.

        " all commented on this controversy.   Generally, however, he was regarded as reliable in antiquity, and is especially so today. Many scholars, ancient and modern, routinely cite Herodotus . Many of these scholars explicitly mention the reliability of Herodotuss work and demonstrate corroboration of Herodotuss writings by modern scholars.  A.H.L. Heeren quoted Herodotus throughout his work and provided corroboration by scholars regarding several passages .  To further his work on the Egyptians and Assyrians, Aubin uses Herodotuss accounts in various passages and defends Herodotuss position. Aubin said that Herodotus was the author of the first important narrative history of the world .  Diop provides several examples which, he argues, support his view that Herodotus was quite scrupulous, objective, scientific for his time. Diop argues that Herodotus always distinguishes carefully between what he has seen and what he has been told. Diop also notes that Strabo corroborated Herodotuss ideas about the Black Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Colchians.            The reliability of Herodotuss writing about Egypt is sometimes criticized.  Alan B. Lloyd argues that, as a historical document, the writings of Herodotus are seriously defective, and that he was working from inadequate sources . Nielsen writes: Though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of Herodotus having been in Egypt, it must be said that his narrative bears little witness to it. German historian Detlev Fehling questions whether Herodotus ever traveled up the Nile River, and considers doubtful almost everything that he says about Egypt and Ethiopia.  Fehling states that there is not the slightest bit of history behind the whole story about the claim of Herodotus that Pharaoh ": null

        ", sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments  – an account also given by Marcellinus in his Life of Thucydides. Marcellinus, Life of Thucydides In fact, Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with Periclean Athens becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece. As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states – Thebes and Corinth in particular.     The Histories were sometimes criticized in antiquity, but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of Herodotuss methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing. A few modern scholars have argued that Herodotus exaggerated the extent of his travels and invented his sources, yet his reputation continues largely intact. Herodotus is variously considered father of comparative anthropology , the father of ethnography , and more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history .       It is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the Histories that Herodotus utilizes various sources in his narrative. K.H. Waters relates that Herodotos did not work from a purely Hellenic standpoint; he was accused by the patriotic but somewhat imperceptive Plutarch of being philobarbaros, a pro-barbarian or pro-foreigner.     Herodotus at times relates various accounts of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io. However, Herodotus at times arbitrates between varying accounts: I am not going to say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man who I know for a fact began the wrong-doing against the Greeks. Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself.     Throughout his work, Herodotus attempts to explain the actions of people. Speaking about Solon the Athenian, Herodotus states sailed away on the pretext of seeing the world, but it was really so that he could not be compelled to repeal any of the laws he had laid down. Again, in the story about Croesus and his sons death, when speaking of Adrastus , Herodotus states: Adrastus ... believing himself to be the most ill-fated man he had ever known, cut his own throat over the grave.       Herodotus writes with the purpose of explaining; that is, he discusses the reason for or cause of an event. He lays this out in the proem: This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other.     This mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer, who opened the Iliad by asking:     :Which of the immortals set these two at each others throats?   :Apollo,   :Zeus’ son and Leto’s, offended   :by the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored   :Chryses, Apollos priest, so the god   :struck the Greek camp with plague,   :and the soldiers were dying of it. Homer, Iliad, trans. Stanley Lombardo : 1, Bk. 1, lines 9–16.     Both Homer and Herodotus begin with a question of causality. In Homers case, who set these two at each others throats? In Herodotuss case, Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?     Herodotuss means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. It is notable, however, that the obligations of gratitude and revenge are the fundamental human motives for Herodotus, just as ... they are the primary stimulus to the generation of narrative itself.     Some readers of Herodotus believe that his habit of tying events back to personal motives signifies an inability to see broader and more abstract reasons for action. Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.       Herodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents. These are not perceived as mutually exclusive, but rather mutually interconnected. This is true of Greek thinking in general, at least from Homer onward. Gould notes that invoking the supernatural in order to explain an event does not answer the question why did this happen? but rather why did this happen to me? By way of example, faulty craftsmanship is the human cause for a house collapsing. However, divine will is the reason that the house collapses at the particular moment when I am inside. It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.     Some authors, including Geoffrey de Ste-Croix and Mabel Lang , have argued that Fate, or the belief that this is how it had to be, is Herodotuss ultimate understanding of causality. Herodotuss explanation that an event was going to happen maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. The idea of it was going to happen reveals a tragic discovery associated with fifth-century drama. This tragic discovery can be seen in Homers ": null

        " as well.     John Gould argues that Herodotus should be understood as falling in a long line of story-tellers, rather than thinking of his means of explanation as a philosophy of history or simple causality . Thus, according to Gould, Herodotuss means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:           Although Herodotus considered his inquiries a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his historical method , by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability. While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man .     In Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of Arion , the renowned harp player, second to no man living at that time, who was saved by a dolphin. Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that a very wonderful thing is said to have happened, and alleges its veracity by adding that the Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter. Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily. He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth. Arion discovered the plot and begged for his life, but the crew gave him two options: that either he kill himself on the spot or jump ship and fend for himself in the sea. Arion flung himself into the water, and a dolphin carried him to shore. Histories 1.23–24.     Herodotus clearly writes as both historian and teller of tales. Herodotus takes a fluid position between the artistic story-weaving of Homer and the rational data-accounting of later historians. John Herrington has developed a helpful metaphor for describing Herodotuss dynamic position in the history of Western art and thought – Herodotus as centaur:         Herodotus is neither a mere gatherer of data nor a simple teller of tales – he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the Histories": null
