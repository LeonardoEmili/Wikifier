Upon his arrival, the Treasury allocated the museum an annual budget of £42, which Wheeler deemed insufficient for its needs. In 42 Wheeler persuaded them to increase that budget, as he highlighted increasing visitor numbers, publications, and acquisitions, as well as a rise in the number of educational projects.

He further described his intention that the Institute should become a laboratory: a laboratory of archaeological science .   Many archaeologists shared his hopes, and to this end Petrie had donated much of his collection of Near Eastern artefacts to Wheeler, in the hope that it would be included in such an institution.

He was keen to emphasise that his workforce consisted of many young people as well as both men and women, thus presenting the image of archaeology as a modern and advanced discipline. According to the later historian Adam Stout, the Maiden Castle excavation was one of the most famous British archaeological investigations of the twentieth century. It was the classic Wheeler dig, both in terms of scale of operations and the publicity which it generated.      Wheelers excavation report was published in 42 as Maiden Castle, Dorset.

        ", many of whom were his students. He was further known for having casual sex in public places. That behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and mistresses of which he was aware. As a result of his behaviour, later archaeologist Gabriel Moshenska informed a reporter from the  Daily Mail  that Wheeler had developed a reputation as a bit of a groper and a sex pest and an incredible bully as well .              Wheeler has been termed the most famous British archaeologist of the twentieth century by archaeologists Gabriel Moshenska and ": null

        ". Highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout British society, they stated that his mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a showmans willingness to package   and sell the past . This was an issue about which Wheeler felt very strongly; writing his obituary for the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, the English archaeologist Stuart Piggott noted that Wheeler placed great importance to the archaeologists obligation to the public, on whose support the prosecution of his subject ultimately depended.      Piggott believed that Wheelers greatest impact was as the great innovator in field techniques , comparing him in this respect to Pitt-Rivers. Piggott stated that the importance of Wheelers contribution to archaeological technique, enormous and far-reaching, lies in the fact that in the early 42s he not only appreciated and understood what Pitt-Rivers had done, but saw that his work could be used as a basis for adaptation, development and improvement.  L. C. Carr stated that it was for his methodological developments, oft termed the Wheeler Method , that Wheeler was best known; in this she contrasted him with those archaeologists who were best known for their associations with a specific archaeological site, such as Arthur Evans and ": null

Wheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters; Carr stated that both Wheeler and his first wife emphasised technical rigour and a full presentation of materials unearthed, as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience.  Focusing on Wheelers publications regarding South Asian archaeology, Sudeshna Guha noted that he produced an assemblage of image-objects that embodied the precision he demanded from excavation photography.    Mallowan noted that Immediate and swift presentation of results was more important to him than profound scholarship, although his critical sense made him conscious that it was necessary to maintain high standards and he would approve of nothing that was slipshod.

She asserted that while Wheeler was not an original thinker, he had a vision of human history that enabled him to see each discovery of its traces, however small, in its widest significance.           Piggott claimed that Wheelers appointment as Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India represented the most remarkable archaeological achievement of his career, an enormous challenge accepted and surmounted in the autocratic and authoritarian terms within which he could best deploy his powers as administrator and excavator. No other archaeologist of the time, it seems fair to remark, could have come near to attaining his command of incisive strategy and often ruthless tactics which won him the bewildered admiration and touching devotion of his Indian staff.  The Indian archaeologist Dilip K. Chakrabarti later stated that Wheelers accomplishments while in India were considerable , particularly given the socio-political turmoil of independence and partition. Chakrabarti stated that Wheeler had contributed to South Asian archaeology in various ways: by establishing a total view of the regions development from the ": null

Similarly, Peter Johansen praised Wheeler for systematising and professionalising Indian archaeology and for instituting a clearly defined body of techniques and methods for field and laboratory work and training.

However, writing in 42 Moshenska and Schadla-Hall asserted that Wheelers reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists, but that instead he had come to be remembered as a cartoonish and slightly eccentric figure whom they termed Naughty Morty .   Carr described the Institute of Archaeology as one of the couples most permanent memorials.          In 42 Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. ": null
