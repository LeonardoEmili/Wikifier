When the files are combined, the compressor can exploit redundancy across several archived files and achieve better compression than a compressor that compresses each files individually.     This approach, however, has disadvantages too:   Extracting or modifying one file is difficult. Extracting one file requires decompressing an entire archive, which can be time- and space-consuming. Modifying one means the file needs to be put back into archive and the archive recompressed again. This operation requires additional time and disk space.   The archive becomes damage-prone. If the area holding shared data for several files is damaged, all those files are lost.   Its impossible to take advantage of redundancy between files unless the compression window is larger than the size of an individual file. For example, gzip uses ": null
