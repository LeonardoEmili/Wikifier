The show also features Corys father Alan , mother Amy , and sister Morgan , while introducing the characters Angela Moore , Rachel McGuire , Jonathan Turner , Eli Williams , and Jack Hunter  during its later seasons.                     The first season begins with Cory Matthews  and his best friend Shawn Hunter , two average sixth-graders. They do not care about schoolwork, despite the efforts of their longtime teacher George Feeny . Initially, their main interest is sports, though later Shawn and then Cory begin to express an interest in girls. This season focuses specifically on Corys relationships with the other characters in the show. He begins to understand his parents more and respect them for all that they do. His relationship with his elder brother Eric  becomes confusing as Erics constant obsession with girls is foreign to Cory, and he becomes more protective of his younger sister Morgan . Cory begins to show interest in Topanga , a smart outsider in his class, though he often hides this by insulting and berating her. Cory and Topanga have known each other since they were kids, making romance in their relationship even more predictable. Cory and Shawns friendship is tested for the first time, and Cory must often choose between doing what Shawn wants him to do and doing what is best for their friendship.       During the second season, Cory, Topanga, and Shawn start high school and meet Jonathan Turner , an unconventional English teacher. Although they initially view Mr. Turner as cool, they soon realize that he is a teacher above all else, which earns him the nickname Feeny with an earring from Cory. Throughout the second season, Cory and Shawn try a variety of ways to become popular with their classmates. In doing so, they nearly get into fights with school bullies and in trouble with Mr. Feeny . Eventually, though Shawn becomes more popular, he maintains his close friendship with the less popular Cory. Shawns mother Virna deserts her son and husband Chet , which upsets Shawn greatly. Chet then leaves to find Virna. After this occurs, Shawn lives briefly with Cory and his parents, but soon figures out that its just not the right fit for him, and later moves in with Mr. Turner. Cory tries at some points to begin a relationship with Topanga, but this is mostly because he does not want to be left out of the dating game. Sensing this, Topanga is wary of his advances, and despite the mutual attraction, the two do not date during this season.     During the third season, Cory finally admits that he wants to ask out Topanga but cannot work up the courage to do it. Consequently, his best friend Shawn asks her out. Although Cory was hurt, he soon realized Shawn set the whole thing up so he could unite Cory and Topanga and make Cory confess his feelings for her. He tells her how he feels, and they become a couple. Later in the third season, Cory and Topanga are worried that their relationship has hit a rut, and decide it would be best to break up while they are still able to keep the friendship. They get back together a few months later when Cory follows her to ": null

He makes progress, but it is not enough; he is not accepted to any colleges or universities as of his high school graduation. He decides then to take a year off and figure things out, beginning with a summer road trip. After finding out in the season finale that Cory feels estranged from him, Eric invites Cory along for the ride. Shawn nearly makes several life-changing blunders this season, but Cory and then Mr. Turner help him to make the right choices. Cory endures several tests of character this season—everything from being credited for a great deed , to being insistently pursued by another girl while he is with Topanga. Sometimes Cory makes the right decision, and sometimes the wrong one, but he learns from each.     The fourth season opens with Cory and Erics return from their road trip. In this season, Eric finds himself confronted with life after high school. After having a couple of jobs and meeting people that teach him some interesting lessons, Eric decides to retake the SAT and give college another try.

However, after being convinced by his father and others around him, Shawn moves in with them but finds he has nothing in common with Jack, which causes a lot of tension. A new student, Angela , moves to Philadelphia and begins to date Shawn. Over winter break, the students go skiing on a school trip.
