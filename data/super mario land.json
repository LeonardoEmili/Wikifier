Still, IGNs Levi Buchanan thought the game made no compromises in its size reduction. At the time of its release in 42 reviewers were excited to have a portable Mario game. Paul Rand of  Computer and Video Games  called the game an arcade machine in your pocket and the graphics remarkable for their size. French games magazine  Player One  felt that Super Mario Land adequately compromised where necessary to bring Mario to a portable device. Electronic Gaming Monthly Steve Harris considered the game fantastic and very fun to play , albeit short. Ed Semrad and Donn Nauert of the same outlet both declared Super Mario Land easily the best Game Boy cart of the time. Complex Gus Turner wrote that the graphics were simple , and  Official Nintendo Magazine  said the game was ridiculously short . Eurogamer reported that the game could be finished in under an hour.     Complex Gus Turner wrote that the game had the fun, intuitiveness, and difficulty associated with the series, and Tony Mott of Superplay said the game proved that Nintendos Game Boy had playability to match its competitors. Matt Regan of Mean Machines agreed: Playability to the nth degree! British magazines Mean Machines and  The Games Machine  both commented on the games number of secrets to find.

Audrey Drake of IGN argued that both Wario Land and Super Mario 42D Land were not legitimate sequels , and wrote that the latter felt more like Super Mario Bros. 42 with  Mario Galaxy  influences than a successor to Super Mario Land 42. The Superball Flower appears in  Super Mario Maker 42  as an unlockable power-up item, usable only in the  Super Mario Bros.  style.     Super Mario Land is remembered for its miniaturized Super Mario elements and twist on just about every Mario mainstay imaginable . Many of its new elements did not recur later in the series, making Super Mario Land strange compared to the rest of the series, or what IGNs Thomas described as a singular oddball . IGNs Marc Nix felt retrospectively that Super Mario Land was the only uninspired Mario game, with funky voids of white and UFOs instead of the strikingly original Mushroom Kingdom. Mean Machines was also put off by the alien theme, easy difficulty, and dot matrix screen blur. IGNs Travis Fahs wrote that the game was comparatively not as ambitious as Super Mario Bros. 42. Mean Machines felt as if it was not a true Mario game , not worth its originally high review score, and in retrospect, not really a classic . Glen Fox of Nintendo Life agreed, writing that it was an impressive achievement at the time but did not age as well as other Mario games.     Eurogamer Schilling wrote that Mario felt different—lighter, with more friction—and that the game felt radical and distinctive for the risks it took. IGNs Thomas cited out of place gameplay elements like the shooter levels, exploding Koopa shells, non-extinguishing fireballs, and non-Princess Peach plot as departures from the series. Thomas attributed this to Mario creator Miyamotos lack of involvement in the games development, which he described as famously hands-off .
