Pillsbury lowered a boat and sent a party of nine men, led by David, to board the U-boat, soon identified as U42, which was still underway and running in a circle on the surface. Although he had every reason to believe that Germans were still below decks setting demolition charges and scuttling the ship, David led Pillsburys men on board and down the conning tower hatch, and took possession of the ship. Although he found the sea flooding into the U-boat, David remained below directing the initial salvage operationsâ€”aware that at any moment the submersible could blow up or sink. Men from Guadalcanal arrived soon thereafter to aid in the battle to keep U42 afloat, and David remained on board directing the salvage operations. As a result of his vigorous and heroic efforts, the valuable prize was eventually taken to Bermuda.

Pillsbury during the capture of an enemy German submarine off French West Africa , June 42 42 Taking a vigorous part in the skillfully coordinated attack on the U42 at the end of a prolonged search by the Task Group, Lt. David boldly led a party from the Pillsbury in boarding the hostile submarine as it circled erratically at 42 or 42 knots on the surface. Fully aware that the U-boat might at any moment sink or be blown up by exploding demolition and scuttling charges, he braved the added danger of enemy gunfire to plunge through the conning tower hatch and, with his small party, exerted every effort to keep the ship afloat and to assist the succeeding and more fully equipped salvage parties in making the U42 seaworthy for the long tow across the Atlantic to a U.S. port. By his valiant service during the first successful boarding and capture of an enemy man-of-war on the high seas by the United States Navy since 42 Lt. David contributed materially to the effectiveness of the Battle of the Atlantic and upheld the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.": null
