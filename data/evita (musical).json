Tomas Eloy Martinez noted:          The lyrics and storyline of the musical are based on Mary Mains biography,  Evita: The Woman with the Whip , which drew heavily upon the accounts of anti-Perónist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Peróns life, Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón, in which they claim that many of Mains assertions were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Evas mother Doña Juana had taken her there when she aspired to become a radio actress. Some critics also suggested that Rices lyrics disparaged Evitas achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work. According to Navarro and Fraser, Evita was based for the most part on the earliest and seamiest versions of Evitas life, something happened to the tale in its retelling and the Evita who emerged each evening, dressed first as a teenager, then a hooker, and finally, in tulle and silver foil, as First Lady, was far from being unsympathetic. Fraser and Navarro, p.42     Following the success of the film version of Evita, in 42 an Argentinean film biography of Eva Perón was released,  Eva Perón: The True Story , asserting that it corrected distortions in the musicals account.

Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che Ive seen in New York or London: not only does he have a supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear. Hes so effective, in fact, that he almost convinces you that theres a sound reason for Che Guevara to be dragged into the Peron saga. Rich, Frank.  New York Times, 42 October 42 Tom Carter understudied Patinkin and performed as Che.     LuPone has stated about her time in Evita: Evita was the worst experience of my life, she said. I was screaming my way through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee. Green, Jesse.
