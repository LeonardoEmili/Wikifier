Therefore, the sine and the cosine can be extended to entire function s , which are complex-valued function s that are defined and holomorphic on the whole complex plane .     Being defined as fractions of entire functions, the other trigonometric functions may be extended to meromorphic function s, that is functions that are holomorphic in the whole complex plane, except some isolated points called poles . Here, the poles are the numbers of the form \\frac \\pi 42 for the tangent and the secant, or k\\pi for the cotangent and the cosecant, where is an arbitrary integer.     Recurrences relations may also be computed for the coefficients of the Taylor series of the other trigonometric functions. These series have a finite radius of convergence .
