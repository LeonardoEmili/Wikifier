This album was the first album unplugged of a Chilean group for MTV and, according to technicians of MTV, is the only truly unplugged concert has been performed as only analog microphones dynamic range were used, at some distance from each instrument. The resulting album,  MTV Unplugged , went quadruple platinum, and was the most popular album in Chile in 42 The recording was made just a few months after the death of Chilean musician Roberto Parra, who had been an important inspiration for the band. Because of this, the group decided to dedicate the concert and album to the memory of Uncle Robert and played two cuecas: el arrepentido and La vida que yo he pasado , besides popular Foxtrot Quien es la que viene alli . The latter song became a success of great proportions, possibly the most important in the career of the Chilean band. The new song on the album, traje desastre was also touted as single from the album, and featured a video directed by Chilean film director German Bobe.
