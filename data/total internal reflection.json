Solving each equation for  and equating the results, we obtain the general law of refraction for waves:      But the dihedral angle between two planes is also the angle between their normals. So θ 42 is the angle between the normal to the incident wavefront and the normal to the interface, while θ 42 is the angle between the normal to the refracted wavefront and the normal to the interface; and Eq. tells us that the sines of these angles are in the same ratio as the respective velocities.

When we say that the extraordinary refraction of a calcite crystal violates Snells law , we mean that Snells law does not apply to the extraordinary ray, because the direction of this ray inside the crystal generally differs from that of the associated wave-normal , and because the wave-normal speed is itself dependent on direction.                Obviously the angle of refraction cannot exceed 42°. In the limiting case, we put  and  in Eq., and solve for the critical angle:      In deriving this result, we retain the assumption of isotropic media in order to identify θ 42 and θ 42 with the angles of incidence and refraction. For non-isotropic media, Eq. still describes the law of refraction in terms of wave-normal directions and speeds, but the range of applicability of that law is determined by the constraints on the ray directions .     For electromagnetic waves, and especially for light, it is customary to express the above results in terms of refractive indices. The refractive index of a medium with normal velocity v_42 is defined as n_c/v_42 , where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Born & Wolf, 42 p.42; Jenkins & White, 42 pp.42–42 This definition uses a vacuum as the reference medium . In principle, any isotropic medium can be chosen as the reference. For some purposes it is convenient to choose air, in which the speed of light is about 42% lower than in a vacuum . The present article, however, chooses a vacuum.  Hence v_c/n_42 . Similarly, v_42c/n_42 . Making these substitutions in Eqs.and, we obtain      and      Eq. is the law of refraction for general media, in terms of refractive indices, provided that θ 42 and θ 42 are taken as the dihedral angles; but if the media are isotropic, then  and  become independent of direction while θ 42 and θ 42 may be taken as the angles of incidence and refraction for the rays, and Eq. follows. So, for isotropic media, Eqs.and together describe the behavior in Fig.42     According to Eq., for incidence from water  to air , we have , whereas for incidence from common glass or acrylic  to air , we have .     The arcsin function yielding θ c is defined only if  . Hence, for isotropic media, total internal reflection cannot occur if the second medium has a higher refractive index than the first. For example, there cannot be TIR for incidence from air to water; rather, the critical angle for incidence from water to air is the angle of refraction at grazing incidence from air to water . Cf. Jenkins & White, 42 p.42     The medium with the higher refractive index is commonly described as optically denser, and the one with the lower refractive index as optically rarer. Jenkins & White, 42 pp.4242 Hence it is said that total internal reflection is possible for dense-to-rare incidence, but not for rare-to-dense incidence.

The brightness of the reflected image — just as bright as the direct view — can be startling.     A similar effect can be observed by opening ones eyes while swimming just below the waters surface. If the water is calm, the surface outside the critical angle appears mirror-like, reflecting objects below. The region above the water cannot be seen except overhead, where the hemispherical field of view is compressed into a conical field known as  Snells  window , whose angular diameter is twice the critical angle . The field of view above the water is theoretically 42° across, but seems less because as we look closer to the horizon, the vertical dimension is more strongly compressed by the refraction; e.g., by Eq., for air-to-water incident angles of 42°, 42°, and 42°, the corresponding angles of refraction are 42° , 42°, and 42°, indicating that the image of a point 42° above the horizon is 42° from the edge of Snells window while the image of a point 42° above the horizon is only 42° from the edge.

The same continuity condition implies that the variation of the field in medium  42 will be synchronized with that of the incident and reflected waves in medium  42          But, if the reflection is total, the spatial penetration of the fields into medium  42 must be limited somehow, or else the total extent and hence the total energy of those fields would continue to increase, draining power from medium  42 Total reflection of a continuing wavetrain permits some energy to be stored in medium  42 but does not permit a continuing transfer of power from medium  42 to medium  42     Thus, using mostly qualitative reasoning, we can conclude that total internal reflection must be accompanied by a wavelike field in the external medium, traveling along the interface in synchronism with the incident and reflected waves, but with some sort of limited spatial penetration into the external medium; such a field may be called an  evanescent  wave .

Suppose, for example, that electromagnetic waves incident from glass to air at a certain angle of incidence are subject to TIR. And suppose that we have a third medium whose refractive index is sufficient high that, if the third medium were to replace the second , we would get a standard transmitted wavetrain for the same angle of incidence. Then, if the third medium is brought within a few wavelengths of the first, where the evanescent wave has significant amplitude, the evanescent wave is effectively refracted into the third medium, giving non-zero transmission into the third medium, and therefore less than total reflection back into the first medium.

In the electrical engineering convention, the time-dependent factor is  so that a phase advance corresponds to multiplication by a complex constant with a positive argument. This article, however, uses the physics convention, with the time-dependent factor .

        " components, which are parallel to the surface and the plane of incidence, respectively; in other words, the s  and  p components are respectively square and parallel to the plane of incidence. The s originally comes from the German senkrecht, meaning perpendicular . The alternative mnemonics in the text are perhaps more suitable for English speakers.     For each component of polarization, the incident, reflected, or transmitted electric field  has a certain direction, and can be represented by its scalar component in that direction. The reflection or transmission coefficient can then be defined as a ratio of complex components at the same point, or at infinitesimally separated points on opposite sides of the interface. But, in order to fix the signs of the coefficients, we must choose positive senses for the directions . For the s components, the obvious choice is to say that the positive directions of the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields are all the same . For the p components, this article adopts the convention that the positive directions of the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields are inclined towards the same medium . In other words, for both polarizations, this article uses the convention that the positive directions of the incident, reflected, and transmitted fields are all the same for whichever field is normal to the plane of incidence; this is the  field for the s polarization, and the  field for the p polarization.  But the reader should be warned that some books use a different convention for the p components, causing a different sign in the resulting formula for the reflection coefficient. One notable authority that uses the different convention is The Feynman Lectures on Physics, at Volume  , eq. , and Volume  , Figs.4242 and 4242     For the s polarization, let the reflection and transmission coefficients be  and  respectively. For the p polarization, let the corresponding coefficients be  and . Then, for  linear , homogeneous , isotropic, non-magnetic media, the coefficients are given by: Born & Wolf, 42 p.42 eqs.,, where the subscript ⊥ corresponds to s, and ∥ to p.                        Now we suppose that the transmitted wave is evanescent. With the correct sign , substituting  into  gives   : r_s\\,\\frac\\,,   where   : nn_42/n_42\\,;   that is,  is the index of the internal medium relative to the external one, or the index of the internal medium if the external one is a vacuum. This nomenclature follows Jenkins & White, 42 pp.42–42 Some authors, however, use the reciprocal refractive index and therefore obtain different forms for our Eqs. and . Examples include Born & Wolf  and Stratton . Furthermore, Born & Wolf define  and  as arguments rather than phase shifts, causing a change of sign.

With the same choice of sign, It is merely fortuitous that the principal square root turns out to be the correct one in the present situation, and only because we use the time-dependent factor . If we instead used the electrical engineers time-dependent factor , choosing the principal square root would yield the same argument for the reflection coefficient, but this would be interpreted as the opposite phase shift, which would be wrong. But if we choose the square root so that the transmitted field is evanescent, we get the right phase shift with either time-dependent factor. substituting  into  gives   : r_p\\,\\frac\\,,   whose magnitude is 42 and whose ": null
