The first declension locative is by far the most common, because so many Roman place names were first declension, such as Roma, Rome, and therefore use the same form as the genitive and dative: Romae, at Rome, and Hiberniae, in Ireland. A few place-names were inherently plural, even though they are a single city, e.g. Athenae, Athens and Cumae, Cuma. These plural names also use the form similar to the dative and ablative: Athenis, at Athens, and Cumis, at Cumae.

The locative cannot express being located at multiple locations; plural forms only exist because certain proper names such as Athenae happen to be plural.
