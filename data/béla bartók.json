His music can be grouped roughly in accordance with the different periods in his life.       The works of Bartóks youth were written in a classical and early romantic style touched with influences of popular and Gypsy music . Between 42 and 42 he wrote 42 piano pieces with corresponding opus numbers. Although most of these were simple dance pieces, in these early works Bartók began to tackle some more advanced forms, as in his ten-part programmatic A Duna folyása , which he played in his first public recital in 42 .

        " serving as Opus 42 Driven by nationalistic fervor and a desire to transcend the influence of prior composers, Bartók began a lifelong devotion to folk music which was sparked by his overhearing nanny Lidi Dósas singing of Transylvanian folk songs at a Hungarian resort in 42 . Bartók began to collect Magyar peasant melodies, later extending to the folk music of other peoples of the Carpathian Basin . His compositional output would gradually prune away romantic elements in favour of an idiom that embodied folk music as intrinsic and essential to its style. Later in life he would have this to say on the incorporation of folk and art music:     The question is, what are the ways in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody unchanged or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bachs treatment of chorales. ... Another method ... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above. ... There is yet a third way ... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue.      Bartók became first acquainted with Debussys music in 42 and regarded his music highly. In an interview in 42 Bartók said     Debussys great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities. In that, he was just as important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time?  Debussys influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles . These made ": null

Until 42 Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera Bluebeards Castle. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 42 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements .       His pessimistic attitude towards composing was lifted by the stormy and inspiring contact with Klára Gombossy in the summer of 42 . This interesting episode in Bartóks life remained hidden until it was researched by Denijs Dille between 42 and 42 .
