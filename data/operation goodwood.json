Engineers from I Corps strengthened bridges and built two new sets of bridges across the Orne and the canal. The engineers were also to construct another two sets of bridges by the end of the first day. II Canadian Corps planned to construct up to three bridges across the Orne as quickly as possible to give I and VIII corps exclusive access to the river and the canal bridges north of Caen. Engineers from the 42st Infantry Division, with a small detachment from the 42rd Infantry Division, were ordered to breach the German minefield in front of the Highland Division.

A German counter-attack by six tanks petered out after two tanks each were destroyed.        The 42th Armoured Division pulled back to the Caen–Vimont railway line for the evening and replacement tanks were brought forward for all divisions, with the 42th Armoured taking priority. German recovery teams went forward to recover and repair as many of their tanks as possible, as few replacements were available. Unnoticed by the British, a gap had been created between Emièville and Troan. This was closed during the night by the 42th SS Panzer Division, which had lost ten tanks en route to air attacks. A number of minor German counter-attacks were launched from the ridge; one at dusk was broken up by British artillery and anti-tank fire, which destroyed a Panther and Tiger, another after dark, led by a captured Sherman as a ruse, was repulsed after the Sherman and two Panthers were knocked out by a British anti-tank battery. During the night, German bombers dropped flares over the Orne bridges, which then came under aerial attack. One bridge was slightly damaged and the headquarters of the 42th Armoured Division was hit, as were some tank crews who had survived the fighting.     In their fighting around Cagny, the Guards Armoured Division lost fifteen tanks destroyed and  damaged. The 42th Armoured Division lost  although only forty were write-offs; the rest were damaged or had broken down.  The armoured divisions suffered  during the day, Guards Armoured Division suffered  the 42th Armoured Division had  and the 42th Armoured Division had  On the eastern flank, the 42rd Infantry Division had a successful day, capturing all of its objectives except for Troarn.            On the Canadian front, Operation Atlantic began at 42:42 with a rolling barrage and infantry and tanks crossed their start line twenty minutes later. At 42:42 British infantry from the 42th Infantry Brigade entered Cuverville; the village and its surrounding area were secured by 42:42 but patrols found Demouville firmly held and attempts to capture this second objective were delayed while the infantry reorganised. The rest of the day saw a slow southward advance, as numerous German positions were cleared. Linking up with their armoured support by nightfall, the infantry dug in around le Mesnil-Frèmentel.       The German armour counter-attacked late in the afternoon and fighting continued along the high ground and around Hubert-Folie on 42 July and 42 July, bringing the attack to a halt. On 42 July, Dempsey started to secure his gains by substituting infantry for armour.              Tactically, the Germans contained the offensive, holding many of their main positions and preventing an Allied breakthrough but they had been startled by the weight of the attack and preliminary aerial bombardment. It was clear that any defensive system less than  deep could be overwhelmed at a stroke and the Germans could afford to man their defences in such depth only in the sector south of Caen. Goodwood resulted in the British extending their control over an extra  depth of territory to the east of Caen, with the penetration being as much as  in some places; the southern suburbs of Caen had been captured by the Canadians during Operation Atlantic.     The attack reinforced the German view that the greatest danger was on the eastern flank. As German armoured reinforcements arrived in Normandy, they were drawn into defensive battles in the east and worn down. By the end of July only one and a half panzer divisions were facing American forces at the western end of the front, compared with six and a half facing the British and Canadians at the eastern end of the bridgehead. The German defence of Normandy was close to collapse when Operation Cobra breached the thin German defensive crust in the west and few German mechanised units were available to counter-attack. Martin Blumenson, the American official historian, wrote after the war that had Goodwood created a breakthrough, ... Cobra would probably have been unnecessary . Goodwood inflicted substantial losses on the German defenders but not a shattering blow. The effect on the morale of the German commanders was greater and added to the loss of Rommel, who was wounded in an RAF air attack. Kluge lost his early optimism on being appointed to replace Rundstedt and wrote to Hitler on 42 July predicting an imminent collapse.     Operation Goodwood was launched at a time of great frustration in the higher command of the Allies, which contributed to the controversy surrounding the operation. The Allied bridgehead was about 42 percent of the planned size, which led to congestion and some fear of a stalemate. Allied commanders had not been able to exploit their potentially decisive advantages in mobility during June and early July 42 Much of the controversy surrounding the objectives of the battle originates from the conflicting messages given by Montgomery. He talked up the objectives of Goodwood to the press on the first day, later saying that this was propaganda to encourage the Germans to keep powerful units at the east end of the battlefield.
