A literal is either a variable, called positive literal, or the negation of a variable, called negative literal.   A clause is a disjunction of literals . A clause is called a  Horn clause  if it contains at most one positive literal.   A formula is in  conjunctive normal form  if it is a conjunction of clauses .   For example,  is a positive literal,  is a negative literal,  is a clause. The formula  is in conjunctive normal form; its first and third clauses are Horn clauses, but its second clause is not. The formula is satisfiable, by choosing x 42    FALSE, x 42    FALSE, and x 42 arbitrarily, since ∧  ∧ ¬FALSE evaluates to ∧  ∧ TRUE, and in turn to TRUE ∧ TRUE ∧ TRUE . In contrast, the CNF formula a ∧ ¬a, consisting of two clauses of one literal, is unsatisfiable, since for aTRUE or aFALSE it evaluates to TRUE ∧ ¬TRUE or FALSE ∧ ¬FALSE , respectively.     For some versions of the SAT problem,  it is useful to define the notion of a generalized conjunctive normal form formula, viz. as a conjunction of arbitrarily many generalized clauses, the latter being of the form  for some boolean operator R and literals . Different sets of allowed boolean operators lead to different problem versions.  As an example, R is a generalized clause, and R ∧ R ∧ R is a generalized conjunctive normal form.

First, the question is asked on the given formula Φ. If the answer is no , the formula is unsatisfiable. Otherwise, the question is asked on the partly instantiated formula Φ, i.e. Φ with the first variable x 42 replaced by TRUE, and simplified accordingly. If the answer is yes , then x 42 TRUE, otherwise x 42 FALSE. Values of other variables can be found subsequently in the same way.
