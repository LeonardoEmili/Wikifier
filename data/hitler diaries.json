In 42 Kujau rented a shop into which he placed his Nazi memorabilia; the outlet also became the venue for late-night drinking sessions with friends and fellow collectors, including Wolfgang Schulze, who lived in the US and became Kujaus agent there.

At the end of 42 Tiefenthaeler contacted Heidemann to say that Stiefel had shown him around his collection, which included a Hitler diary—the only one Kujau had forged to that point. According to Hamilton the discovery inflamed Heidemann almost to madness , and he aggressively pressed for what would be a journalistic scoop.     Stiefel showed Heidemann the diary in Stuttgart in January 42 telling him it was from a plane crash in East Germany, although he refused to tell the journalist the name of his source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemanns requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the Stern offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baurs autobiography, knew of Gundlfingers flight, and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 42 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flights crew.     In January 42 Tiefenthaeler gave Kujaus telephone number to Heidemann, telling the journalist to ask for Mr Fischer , one of Kujaus aliases. During the subsequent phone call Kujau told Heidemann that there were 42 volumes of Hitlers diaries, the original manuscript of the unpublished third volume of Mein Kampf, an opera by the young Hitler called  , numerous letters and unpublished papers, and several of Hitlers paintings—most of which were still in East Germany. Heidemann offered two  million DMs for the entire collection and guaranteed secrecy until everything had been brought over the border. Although the pair did not agree to a deal, they agreed to the foundations of a deal , according to Harris; Kujaus condition was that he would only deal directly with Heidemann, something that suited the journalist as a way of keeping other members of Stern away from the story.     Heidemann and Walde produced a prospectus for internal discussion, outlining what was available for purchase and the costs. The document, signed by Heidemann, finished with a veiled threat: If our company thinks that the risk is too great, I suggest that I should seek out a publishing company in the United States which could put up the money and ensure that we get the German publication rights. The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at Stern, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahrs deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 42  mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted a little over two hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 42  pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.       At that first meeting on 42 January 42 which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 42  DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the following day, the reporter revealed an additional lure he had brought with him: a uniform which he said was Görings. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call him as soon as he could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.        A week later Kujau met Jäckel and Alex Kuhn in connection with the poems he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These had been published by Jäckel and Kuhn in 42 but one historian pointed out that one of the poems could not have been produced by Hitler as it had been written by the poet ": null
    },
    {
        "Herybert Menzel": "herybert menzel"
    },
    {
        ". Jäckel was concerned that the poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefels collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, saying he was only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; Jäckel advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 42 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about the problems with the poems, and that the source had been Kujau, but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.     Ten days after the meeting with Jäckel and Kuhn, Kujau had prepared three further diaries. The contents were copied from a range of books, newspapers and magazines covering Hitlers life. Primary among them was the two-volume work by the historian ": null

    },
    {
        ",  , which presents Hitlers day-to-day activities. Many of the diarys entries were lists of Nazi party promotions and official engagements. Although Kujau created some personal information about Hitler in the diaries, this was, in the opinion of both Harris and Hamilton, trivia. He began working to a schedule of producing three diaries a month. He later stated that he managed to produce one of the volumes in three hours; on a separate occasion he wrote three diaries in three days.     On 42 February 42 Kujau flew to Stuttgart and gave Heidemann the three recently prepared diaries, for which Heidemann gave him 42  DMs. This was a great deal less than the 42  DMs to 42  DMs per diary—promised to Kujau in the first meeting, from which Heidemann would also claim a 42% commission; the reduction in funds was explained by a need to get an expert opinion on the authenticity of the diaries, and the balance was later paid. The following day the reporter delivered the diaries to Gruner + Jahr. In the subsequent meeting with Walde, Hensmann, Sorge and Fischer, Heidemann and Walde again insisted on secrecy about the project, to ensure their acquisition of all the diaries—it was agreed that not even the editors of Stern should be told of the discovery. More importantly, according to Harris, it was decided that they should not have the material examined by a forensic scientist or historian until every diary had been obtained. Fischer committed the company to the future purchases by immediately allocating one  million DM to the project. The company also set up a dedicated unit to deal with the diaries in an annex to the main Gruner + Jahr offices. It was headed by Walde, and consisted of an assistant, two secretaries and Heidemann. On receipt of the diaries they were photocopied and transcribed from the gothic script into modern German. Heidemann also entered into a private contract with Gruner + Jahr, which was kept secret from the companys legal and personnel departments. It contained a deal for him to publish books through the company at a generous royalty rate, and agreed that ten years after publication the original diaries would be given to Heidemann for research purposes, to be handed on to the West German government on his death. He was also to be given a bonus of 42  DMs for recovering the first eight diaries.          The delivery of the diaries continued, although there were tensions between Heidemann and Kujau, partly owing to the journalists domineering personality and duplicity . Because of the nature of the transactions there were no receipts provided by Heidemann to Gruner + Jahr, and the business was conducted by the company on the basis of trust. By the end of February 42 42  DMs had been paid for the diaries, only around half of which was received by Kujau. Heidemann had pocketed the rest, defrauding both his employer and the forger in the process.     Despite the self-imposed restrictions of secrecy placed on the small circle inside Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann could not resist showing one of the volumes to Mohnke, as the entry referred to the ": null

Mohnke informed him that the entries were inaccurate, saying that the Lichterfelde barracks were not occupied by the troops on that date, that the regimental name used in the diary was introduced much later, and that so far as he knew Hitler never visited the Friesenstraße barracks. Heidemann was unmoved by his friends revelations, and posited that Hitler had probably written what he was planning to do, not what he had done. Harris suggests that this showed that the journalist had long ceased operating on a rational wavelength about the diaries .

After twelve diaries had been delivered to Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann informed his employers that the price had risen from 42  DMs to 42  DMs per diary; the reason given by Heidemann was that the East German general smuggling the diaries was now having to bribe more people.

This sum had purchased 42 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an authorisation for a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he signed a further authorisation for 42  DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of the diaries had now risen to 42  DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 42 diaries.

In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefels phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesacks photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.       In April 42 Walde and Heidemann contacted Josef Henke and Klaus Oldenhage of the  and Max Frei-Sulzer, the former head of the forensic department of the Zürich police, for assistance in authenticating the diaries. They did not specifically mention the diaries, but referred generally to new material. They also did not give the forensic specialists an entire diary, but removed one page only. For comparison purposes they also provided the experts with other samples of Hitlers writing, a handwritten draft for a telegram: this was from Heidemanns own collection and had also been forged by Kujau. Within days Walde provided further documents for comparison—all Kujau forgeries. Walde then flew to the US and commissioned Ordway Hilton, another forensic expert. None of those involved were experts in examining Nazi documents, and Hilton could not read German. Sterns management were too bound up in a secretive approach to be open about their source, or to provide the experts with a complete diary, which would have led to a more thorough examination of wider material. From the samples provided, the experts concluded that the handwriting was genuine. Hilton subsequently reported that there was just no question that both documents he had were written by the same person, whom he assumed to be Hitler.     The purchase of the diaries continued, and by June 42 Gruner + Jahr possessed 42 volumes. In early 42 the company took the decision to work towards a publication date for the diaries. To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, Stern issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties, Newsweek,  Time ,  Paris Match  and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch. Stern rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.     The first historian to examine the diaries was Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was cautious, but impressed with the volume of documentation in front of him. As the background to the acquisition was explained to him he became less doubtful; he was falsely informed that the paper had been chemically tested and been shown to be pre-war, and he was told that Stern knew the identity of the  officer who had rescued the documents from the plane and had stored them ever since. By the end of the meeting he was convinced that the diaries were genuine, and later said who, I asked myself, would forge sixty volumes when six would have served his purpose?  In an article in The Times on 42 April 42 he wrote:          I am now satisfied that the documents are authentic; that the history of their wanderings since 42 is true; and that the standard accounts of Hitlers writing habits, of his personality, and even, perhaps, of some public events may, in consequence, have to be revised.     The day after Trevor-Roper gave his opinion of authenticity, Rupert Murdoch and his negotiation team arrived in Zürich. A deal was provisionally agreed for $42  million for the US serialisation rights, with an additional $42 for British and Commonwealth rights. While the discussions between Murdoch and Sorge were taking place, the diaries were examined by Broyle and his Newsweek team. After lengthy negotiation Broyle was informed that the minimum price Stern would consider was $42  million; the Americans returned home, informing Hensmann that they would contact him by phone in two days. When Broyle contacted the Germans he offered the amount, subject to authentication by their chosen expert, ": null

        ". In 42 Weinberg, a cautious and careful historian, had written the Guide to Captured German Documents, for use by the US military; the work is described by Hamilton as definitive in its scope of the subject. Weinberg travelled to Zürich and, like Trevor-Roper, was impressed and reassured by the range of items on show; he was also partly persuaded by Trevor-Ropers endorsement of the diaries authenticity. Weinberg commented that the notion of anyone forging hundreds, even thousands of pages of handwriting was hard to credit .     Newsweek verbally accepted Hensmanns offer and he in turn informed Murdoch, giving him the option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 42 April 42 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of Newsweek, met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $42  million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of Stern, with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements and came to a second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $42 for the US rights, and $42 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with Paris Match for $42; in Spain with Grupo Zeta for $42; in the Netherlands for $42; in Norway for $42; and in Italy with  Panorama  for $42. Newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.     Stern press conference     On 42 April 42 a press release from Stern announced the existence of the diaries and their forthcoming publication; a press conference was announced for 42 April.

The following day The Times published the news that their Sunday sister paper had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery.

After an evening meeting of the editorial staff, Giles phoned Trevor-Roper to ask him to write a piece rebutting the criticism of the diaries.

On the afternoon of the 42 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting exactly like an officer of the British army in 42 At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives what he was going to say at the announcement the following day.     At the press conference both Trevor-Roper and Weinberg expressed their doubts at the authenticity, and stated that German experts needed to examine the diaries to confirm whether the works were genuine. Trevor-Roper went on to say that his doubts sprung from the lack of proof that these books were the same ones as had been on the crashed plane in 42 He finished his statement by saying that I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop. The leading article in  The Guardian  described his public reversal as showing moral courage .

Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted Ink! Ink! .           With grave doubts now expressed about the authenticity of the diaries, Stern faced the possibility of legal action for disseminating Nazi propaganda. To ensure a definitive judgment on the diaries, Hagen, one of the companys lawyers, passed three complete diaries to Henke at the  for a more complete forensic examination.

He later reported that everything looked wrong , including new-looking ink, poor quality paper and signatures that were terrible renditions of Hitlers. Rendell concludes the diaries were not particularly good fakes, calling them bad forgeries but a great hoax . He states that with the exception of imitating Hitlers habit of slanting his writing diagonally as he wrote across the page, the forger failed to observe or to imitate the most fundamental characteristics of his handwriting.      On 42 May fifteen volumes of the diaries were removed from the Swiss bank vault and distributed to various forensic scientists: four went to the  and eleven went to the Swiss specialists in St Gallen. The initial results were ready on 42 May, which confirmed what the forensic experts had been telling the management of Stern for the last week: the diaries were poor forgeries, with modern components and ink that was not in common use in wartime Germany. Measurements had been taken of the evaporation of chloride in the ink which showed the diaries had been written within the previous two years. There were also factual errors, including some from Domaruss  that Kujau had copied. Before passing the news to Stern, the  had already informed the government, saying it was a ministerial matter . The managers at Stern tried to release the first press statement that acknowledged the forensic findings and stated that the diaries were forged, but the official government announcement was released five minutes before Sterns.       Once the government announcement appeared on television, Kujau took his wife and mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and hearing that Stern had paid nine  million DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the forger agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use a variation of the story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 42 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew all along that the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.     Following a police investigation that lasted over a year, on 42 August 42 the trial against Heidemann and Kujau opened in Hamburg. Both men were charged with defrauding Stern of 42  million DMs. Despite the seriousness of the charges facing the two men, Hamilton considers that it also appeared clear that the trial was going to be a farce, a real slapstick affair that would enrage the judge and amuse the entire world. The proceedings lasted until July 42 when both men were sent to prison: four years and eight months for Heidemann, four years and six months for Kujau. In September one of the supporting magistrates overseeing the case was replaced after he fell asleep; three days later the court were amused to see pictures of Idi Amin s underpants, which Heidemann had framed on his wall. At times the case denigrated into a slanging match between Kujau and Heidemann. In his summing up Judge Hans-Ulrich Schroeder said that the negligence of Stern has persuaded me to soften the sentences against the two main co-conspirators. Heidemann was found guilty of stealing 42  million DMs from Stern; Kujau guilty of receiving 42  million DMs for his role in the forgeries. Despite the lengthy investigation and trial, at least five  million DMs remained unaccounted for.       thu , who published an account of the hoax in 42   When Kujau was released from prison in 42 he was suffering from throat cancer. He opened a gallery in Stuttgart and sold forgeries of Salvador Dalí and Joan Miró , all signed with his own name. Although he prospered, Kujau was later arrested for forging driving licences; he was fined the equivalent of £42.

In 42 he had debts exceeding €42, and was living on social security; his situation had not changed by 42 and he remained bitter about his treatment.     Two of Sterns editors, Koch and Schmidt, lost their jobs because of the scandal. Both complained strongly when told that their resignations were expected, pointing out that they had both wanted to sack Heidemann in 42 A settlement of 42  million DMs was provided to each of them as part of the severance package. The staff at the magazine were angry at the approach taken by their managers, and held sit-in s to protest at the managements bypassing traditional editorial channels and safeguards . The scandal caused a major crisis for Stern and, according to Esser and Hartung, the magazine once known for its investigative reporting, became a prime example of sensation-seeking checkbook journalism . Sterns credibility was severely damaged and it took the magazine ten years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation. According to the German Historical Institute , the scandal was also instrumental in discrediting the tendency toward an unprejudiced and euphemistic assessment of the Third Reich in West German popular culture .     At the Sunday Times, Murdoch moved Giles to the new position of editor emeritus . When Giles asked what the title meant, Murdoch informed him that Its Latin, Frank; the e means youre out and the meritus means you deserved it. Murdoch later said that circulation went up and it stayed up. We didnt lose money or anything like that , referring to the 42 new readers the paper retained after the scandal broke, and the fact that Stern returned all the money paid to it by the Sunday Times. In April 42 during the Leveson Inquiry , he acknowledged his role in publishing the diaries, and took the blame for making the decision, saying It was a massive mistake I made and I will have to live with it for the rest of my life.
