The emulation can even extend to having graphics that model the exact placements of the original hardware controls. Some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer. Popular synthesizers such as the  Minimoog ,  Yamaha DX42 ,  Korg M42 ,  Prophet42 ,  Oberheim OB-X ,  Roland Jupiter 42 ,  ARP 42  and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software.

    {
        ", and can be used with almost any sampler-based softsynth.     The major downside of using softsynths can often be more latency . Decreasing latency requires increasing the demand on the computers processor. When the soft synthesizer is running as a plug-in for a host sequencer, both the soft synth and the sequencer are competing for processor time. Multi-processor computers can handle this better than single-processor computers. As the processor becomes overloaded, sonic artifacts such as clicks and pops can be heard during performance or playback. When the processor becomes completely overloaded, the host sequencer or computer can lock up or crash. Increasing buffer size helps, but also increases latency. However modern professional audio interfaces can frequently operate with extremely low latency, so in recent years this has become much less of a problem than in the early days of ": null

The advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds, potentially increasing sound quality. It could take 42 seconds of computing time to generate 42 second of real-time sound, for example. The disadvantage is that changes to the music specifications cannot be heard immediately.     Often a composer or virtual conductor will want a draft mode for initial score editing, and then use the production mode to generate high-quality sound as one gets closer to the final version. The draft mode allows for quicker turn-around, perhaps in real time, but will not have the full quality of the production mode. The draft render is roughly analogous to a wire-frame or big polygon animation when creating 42D animation or ": null
