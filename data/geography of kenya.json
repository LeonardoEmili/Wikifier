The further inside Kenya, the more arid the climate becomes. An arid climate is nearly devoid of rainfall, and temperature swings widely according to the general time of the day/night. For many areas of Kenya, the daytime temperature rises about 12  °C , almost every day.     Elevation is the major factor in temperature levels, with the higher areas, on average, as 11  °C cooler, day or night.
