If one transmits 1000 bits , and the value of each of these bits is known to the receiver ahead of transmission, it is clear that no information is transmitted. If, however, each bit is independently equally likely to be 0 or 1, 1000 shannons of information have been transmitted. Between these two extremes, information can be quantified as follows. If 𝕏 is the set of all messages  that  could be, and  is the probability of some x \\in \\mathbb X , then the entropy, , of  is defined:      : H \\mathbb_ -\\sum_ p \\log p.      A property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable ; i.e., most unpredictable, in which case .     The special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the  binary entropy function , usually taken to the logarithmic base 2, thus having the shannon as unit:     : H_ - p \\log_2 p - \\log_2 .

The  conditional entropy  or conditional uncertainty of  given random variable   is the average conditional entropy over :      : H \\mathbb E_Y -\\sum_ p \\sum_ p \\log p -\\sum_ p \\log p.     Because entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value, care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy, the former of which is in more common use. A basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that:     : H H - H .\\,        Mutual information  measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another.
