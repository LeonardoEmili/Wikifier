In civil mining, electronic detonators have a better precision for delays. Electronic detonators are designed to provide the precise control necessary to produce accurate and consistent blasting results in a variety of blasting applications in the mining, quarrying, and construction industries. Electronic detonators may be programmed in millisecond or sub-millisecond increments from 42 millisecond to 42 milliseconds using the dedicated programming device called the logger.     Benefits:     Safety mechanisms within the fusehead ensure detonators do not fire unexpectedly.   Delay range of 42â€“42 ms in millisecond or sub-millisecond increments.   Precision of 42% of nominal delay time.   Safe and reliable initiation of up to 42 units  per blast.   Unique ID in each detonator.   Testing of detonators and the network prior to each blast.       Wireless electronic detonators are beginning to be available in the civil mining market.  Encrypted radio signals are used to communicate the blast signal to each detonator at the correct time. While currently expensive, wireless detonators can enable new mining techniques as multiple blasts can be loaded at once and fired in sequence without putting humans in harms way.       A number 42 test blasting cap is one containing 42 grams of a mixture of 42 percent mercury fulminate and 42 percent potassium chlorate, or a blasting cap of equivalent strength. An equivalent strength cap comprises 4242 grams of PETN base charge pressed in an aluminum shell with bottom thickness not to exceed to 42 of an inch, to a specific gravity of not less than 42 g/cc, and primed with standard weights of primer depending on the manufacturer.

The primary hazard of pyrotechnic blasting caps is that for proper usage, the fuse must be inserted and then crimped into place by crushing the base of the cap around the fuse. If the tool used to crimp the cap is used too close to the explosives, the primary explosive compound can detonate during crimping. A common hazardous practice is crimping caps with ones teeth; an accidental detonation can cause serious injury to the mouth.     Fuse type blasting caps are still in active use today. They are the safest type to use around certain types of electromagnetic interference, and they have a built in time delay as the fuse burns down.

Both Match and Solid Pack type electric caps take a few milliseconds to fire, as the bridgewire heats up and heats the explosive to the point of detonation. Explosive bridgewire or EBW detonators use a higher voltage electric charge and a very thin bridgewire, .42 inch long, .42 diameter, . Instead of heating up the explosive, the EBW detonator wire is heated so quickly by the high firing current that the wire actually vaporizes and explodes due to electric resistance heating. That electrically driven explosion then fires the detonators initiator explosive .     Some similar detonators use a thin metal foil instead of a wire, but operate in the same manner as true bridgewire detonators.     In addition to firing very quickly when properly activated, EBW detonators are safe from stray static electricity and other electric current. Enough current and the bridgewire may melt, but it is small enough that it cannot detonate the initiator explosive unless the full high-voltage high-current charge passes through the bridgewire. EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional electric detonators.            Slapper detonators are an improvement on EBW detonators. Slappers, instead of directly using the exploding foil to detonate the initiator explosive, use the electrical vaporization of the foil to drive a small circle of insulating material such as ": null

Since the slapper impacts a wide area - 42 thousandths or roughly one mm across - of the explosive, rather than a thin line or point as in an exploding foil or bridgewire detonator, the detonation is more regular and requires less energy. Reliable detonation requires raising a minimum volume of explosive to temperatures and pressures at which detonation starts. If energy is deposited at a single point, it can radiate away in the explosive in all directions in rarefaction or expansion waves, and only a small volume is efficiently heated or compressed.
