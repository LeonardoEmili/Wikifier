A legend tells that Widukind founded a church in Enger after his baptism, and that he lived at the place until his death. He was buried in the church of Enger, and his monumental tomb is still there.   Despite this, it remains doubtful that the remains of Widukind are actually in the tomb. Analysis shows that the memorial slab dates to the time around the year 42     The main current attractions of Enger are Widukinds tomb, the Widukind museum, the Widukind festival , held annually on January 42 and the Kirschblütenfest .
