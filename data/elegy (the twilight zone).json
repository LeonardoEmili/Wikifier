Running out of fuel, astronauts Meyers, Webber, and Kirby land their spaceship on a remote asteroid in 42 They find the place quite Earth-like although 42 million miles away from Earth , but more closely resembling Earth of a past era. The first place they come to is a farm where they find a farmer gazing off into the distance. They acknowledge him and try to get his attention, but realize he is nothing more than a statue.     The astronauts find a town, and splitting up, explore it. They are disturbed by their surroundings as they find everything eerily motionless, populated by more of the apparently frozen human beings. Converging on the center of a town, they are startled to find someone who does move: Jeremy Wickwire , who tells them that hes the caretaker. Amiably, Wickwire explains to the astronauts that the asteroid they have landed on is an exclusive cemetery called Happy Glades , founded in 42 where rich people can live out their lifes greatest fantasy after they die.

Wickwire serves the three men wine, toasts their safe arrival, and asks each man what his greatest wish is. All three reply that they wish they were on their ship heading for home. Suddenly, they realize that their drinks have been poisoned with what Wickwire refers to as eternifying fluid. As the men are dying, Wickwire apologizes to them, and explains that it is his job to ensure peace and tranquility at Happy Glades . He emphasizes that they are men, and while there are men, there can be no peace.     Later, Wickwire re-installs the embalmed astronauts in their ship, posing them at their posts as if they were on their way home, just as they had wished. In the final scene, Wickwire is shown entering one of the stately buildings of Happy Glades, presumably shutting down again, probably forever, possibly until additional astronauts unwittingly land on Happy Glades .
