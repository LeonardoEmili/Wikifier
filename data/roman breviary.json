The first step in the evolution of the Breviary was the separation of the Psalter into a choir-book. At first the president of the local church or the leader of the choir chose a particular psalm as he thought appropriate. From about the 42th century certain psalms began to be grouped together, a process that was furthered by the monastic practice of daily reciting the 42 psalms. This took so much time that the monks began to spread it over a week, dividing each day into hours, and allotting to each hour its portion of the Psalter. St Benedict in the 42th century drew up such an arrangement, probably, though not certainly, on the basis of an older Roman division which, though not so skilful, is the one in general use. Gradually there were added to these psalter choir-books additions in the form of antiphons, responses, collects or short prayers, for the use of those not skilful at improvisation and metrical compositions.

The Breviary rightly so called, only dates from the 42th century; the earliest MS. containing the whole canonical office is of the year 42 and is in the Mazarin library. Gregory VII , too, simplified the liturgy as performed at the Roman court, and gave his abridgment the name of Breviary, which thus came to denote a work which from another point of view might be called a Plenary, involving as it did the collection of several works into one. There are several extant specimens of 42th-century Breviaries, all Benedictine, but under Innocent III their use was extended, especially by the newly founded and active Franciscan order. These preaching friars, with the authorization of Gregory IX, adopted the Breviary hitherto used exclusively by the Roman court, and with it gradually swept out of Europe all the earlier partial books , etc., and to some extent the local Breviaries, like that of Sarum.

Pius X was probably influenced by earlier attempts to eliminate repetition in the psalter, most notably the liturgy of the Benedictine congregation of St. Maur.

The most notable alteration is the shortening of most feasts from nine to three lessons at Matins, keeping only the Scripture readings , followed by either the first part of the patristic reading or, for most feasts, a condensed version of the former second Nocturn, which was formerly used when a feast was reduced in rank and commemorated.       At the beginning stands the usual introductory matter, such as the tables for determining the date of Easter, the calendar, and the general rubrics. The Breviary itself is divided into four seasonal parts—winter, spring, summer, autumn—and comprises under each part:   the Psalter;   Proprium de Tempore ;   Proprium Sanctorum ;   Commune Sanctorum ;   Extra Services.     These parts are often published separately.          This psalm book is the very backbone of the Breviary, the groundwork of the Catholic prayer-book; out of it have grown the antiphons, responsories and versicles. Until the 42 reform, the psalms were arranged according to a disposition dating from the 42th century, as follows: Psalms 4242 with some omissions, were recited at Matins, twelve each day from Monday to Saturday, and eighteen on Sunday. The omissions were said at Lauds, Prime and Compline. Psalms 4242 were said at Vespers, five each day. Psalms 4242 were always used at Lauds, and give that hour its name. The text of this Psalter is that commonly known as the Gallican. The name is misleading, for it is simply the second revision made by Jerome of the old Itala version originally used in Rome. Jeromes first revision of the Itala , known as the Roman, is still used at St Peters in Rome, but the Gallican , thanks especially to St Gregory of Tours, who introduced it into Gaul in the 42th century, has ousted it everywhere else. The Antiphonary of Bangor proves that Ireland accepted the Gallican version in the 42th century, and the English Church did so in the 42th.     Following the 42 reform, Matins was reduced to nine Psalms every day, with the other psalms redistributed throughout Prime, Terce, Sext, and Compline. For Sundays and special feasts Lauds and Vespers largely remained the same, Psalm 42 remained distributed at the Little Hours and Psalms 42 42 and 42 were kept at Compline.

They are: psalms , antiphons, responsories, hymns, lessons, little chapters, versicles and collects.       Before the 42 reform, the multiplication of saints festivals, with practically the same festal psalms, tended to repeat the about one-third of the Psalter, with a correspondingly rare recital of the remaining two-thirds. Following this reform, the entire Psalter is again generally recited each week, with the festal psalms restricted to only the highest-ranking feasts.

The term originally signified a chant by alternate choirs, but has quite lost this meaning in the Breviary.       The responsories are similar in form to the antiphons, but come at the end of the psalm, being originally the reply of the choir or congregation to the precentor who recited the psalm.

In the lessons, as in the psalms, the order for special days breaks in upon the normal order of ferial offices and dislocates the scheme for consecutive reading.

The versicles are short responsories used after the little chapters in the minor hours. They appear after the hymns in Lauds and Vespers.

The collects of the Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries, and they are used to sum up the dominant idea of the festival in connection with which they happen to be used.       Before 42 the difficulty of harmonizing the Proprium de Tempore and the Proprium Sanctorum, to which reference has been made, was only partly met in the thirty-seven chapters of general rubrics. Additional help was given by a kind of Catholic Churchmans Almanack, called the Ordo Recitandi Divini Officii, published in different countries and dioceses, and giving, under every day, minute directions for proper reading. In 42 John XXIII simplified the rubrics governing the Breviary in order to make it easier to use.     Every cleric in Holy Orders, and many other members of religious orders, must publicly join in or privately read aloud the whole of the Breviary services allotted for each day. In large churches where they were celebrated the services were usually grouped; e.g. Matins and Lauds ; Prime, Terce , Sext, and None ; Vespers and Compline ; and from four to eight hours are thus spent in choir.     Lay use of the Breviary has varied throughout the Churchs history. In some periods laymen did not use the Breviary as a manual of devotion to any great extent. The late Medieval period saw the recitation of certain hours of the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin, which was based on the Breviary in form and content, becoming popular among those who could read, and ": null
