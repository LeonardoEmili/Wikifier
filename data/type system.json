Beyond simple value-type pairs, a virtual region of code is associated with an effect component describing what is being done with what, and enabling for example to throw an error report. Thus the symbolic system may be a type and effect system, which endows it with more safety checking than type checking alone.       Whether automated by the compiler or specified by a programmer, a type system makes program behavior illegal if outside the type-system rules. Advantages provided by programmer-specified type systems include:   Abstraction  – Types enable programmers to think at a higher level than the bit or byte, not bothering with low-level implementation.

Languages are often colloquially referred to as strongly typed or weakly typed. In fact, there is no universally accepted definition of what these terms mean. In general, there are more precise terms to represent the differences between type systems that lead people to call them strong or weak .             A third way of categorizing the type system of a programming language uses the safety of typed operations and conversions. Computer scientists use the term type-safe language to describe languages that do not allow operations or conversions that violate the rules of the type system.     Computer scientists use the term memory-safe language  to describe languages that do not allow programs to access memory that has not been assigned for their use. For example, a memory-safe language will ": null

If  were a different string, one that could not be converted to a number , the result would be well-defined as well. Note that a program can be type-safe or memory-safe and still crash on an invalid operation; in fact, if a program encounters an operation that is not type-safe, terminating the program is often the only option.     Now consider a similar example in C:       int x 42;   char y 42 ;   char z x + y;       In this example  will point to a memory address five characters beyond , equivalent to three characters after the terminating zero character of the string pointed to by . This is memory that the program is not expected to access. It may contain garbage data, and it certainly doesnt contain anything useful. As this example shows, C is neither a memory-safe nor a type-safe language.     In general, type-safety and memory-safety go hand in hand. For example, a language that supports pointer arithmetic and number-to-pointer conversions is neither memory-safe nor type-safe, because it allows arbitrary memory to be accessed as if it were valid memory of any type.

The consistency relation is symmetric but not transitive.             Many static type systems, such as those of C and Java, require type declarations: the programmer must explicitly associate each variable with a specific type. Others, such as Haskells, perform  type inference : the compiler draws conclusions about the types of variables based on how programmers use those variables. For example, given a function  that adds  and  together, the compiler can infer that  and  must be numbers—since addition is only defined for numbers.

If the type of  e  and the type of x are the same, and assignment is allowed for that type, then this is a valid expression. Thus, in the simplest type systems, the question of whether two types are compatible reduces to that of whether they are equal . Different languages, however, have different criteria for when two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. These different equational theories of types vary widely, two extreme cases being  structural type system s, in which any two types that describe values with the same structure are equivalent, and  nominative type system s, in which no two syntactically distinct type expressions denote the same type .
