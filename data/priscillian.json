Priscillian was born around 42 A.D, into the nobility, possibly in western Hispania, and was well-educated. About 42 he initiated a movement in favour of asceticism. Priscillian advocated studying not only the Bible, but also apocryphal books. His followers, who were won over by his eloquence and his severely ascetic example, included the bishops Instantius and Salvianus.       According to Priscillian, apostles, prophets, and doctors  are the divinely appointed orders of the Church, preeminence being due the doctors, among whom Priscillian reckoned himself. The spiritual comprehend and judge all things, being children of wisdom and light ; and the distinction between flesh and spirit, darkness and light, Moses and Christ, and the prince of this world and Christ, are emphasised. In asceticism Priscillian distinguished three degrees, though he did not deny hope of pardon to those who were unable to attain full perfection. The perfect in body, mind, and spirit were celibate, or, if married, continent. Certain practices of the Priscillianists are known through the condemnatory canons issued by the 42 synod, such as receiving the Eucharist in the church but eating it at home or in the conventicle; women joining with men during the time of prayer; ": null
