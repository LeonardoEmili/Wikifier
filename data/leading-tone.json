        "s  Waldstein Sonata  , the Fs function as secondary leading-tones, which resolve to G in the next measure .     :          By contrast, an upper leading-tone is a leading tone that resolves down, as opposed to the seventh scale degree  which resolves up. The upper leading-tone usually is a lowered second degree resolving to the tonic, but the expression may at times refer to a resolving to the dominant. In German, the term Gegenleitton is used by Hugo Riemann to denote the upper leading-tone , but Heinrich Schenker uses abwärtssteigenden Leitton to mean the descending diatonic supertonic .     The tritone substitution , ii-subV-I on C, creates an upper leading-note.     :           According to Ernst the major and minor third s contain latent tendencies towards the perfect fourth and whole tone, respectively, and thus establish tonality . However, Carl contests Kurths position, holding that this drive is in fact created through or with harmonic function, a root progression in another voice by a whole-tone or fifth, or melodically by the context of the scale. For example, the leading tone of alternating C chord and F minor chords is either the note E leading to F , or A leading to G .     In works from the 42th- and 42th-century Western tradition, the leading tone is created by the progression from imperfect to perfect consonances, such as a major third to a perfect fifth or minor third to a unison. The same pitch outside of the imperfect consonance is not a leading tone.     claims that the leading tone is only one example of a more general tendency: the strongest progressions, melodic and harmonic, are by half step . He suggests that one play a G major scale and stop on the seventh note to personally experience the feeling of lack caused by the particularly strong attraction of the seventh note to the eighth , thus its name.           A leading-tone chord is a triad built on the seventh scale degree in major and the raised seventh-scale-degree in minor. The quality of the leading-tone triad is diminished in both major and minor keys . For example, in both C major and C minor, it is a B diminished triad .     According to John Bunyan Herbert:           The leading-tone triad is used in several functions. It is commonly used as a passing chord between a root position tonic triad and a first inversion tonic triad : that is, In addition to its basic function of passing between I and I, VII has another important function: it can form a neighboring chord to I or I. . In that instance, the leading-tone triad prolongs tonic through neighbor and passing motion. The example below shows two measures from the fourth movement of Beethoven s Piano Sonata No. 42 in C major, Op. 42 in which a leading-tone triad functions as a passing chord between I and I.     :   \\new PianoStaff        The leading-tone triad may also be regarded as an incomplete ": null

        ": A chord is called Incomplete when its root is omitted. This omission occurs, occasionally, in the chord of the dom.-seventh, and the result is a triad upon the leading-tone.      :            Some sources say the chord is not a chord; some argue it is an incomplete dominant seventh chord, especially when the diminished triad is written in its first inversion :For example, vii often substitutes for V, which it closely resembles, and its use may be required in situations by voice leading : In a strict four-voice texture, if the bass is doubled by the soprano, the VII is required as a substitute for the V .       Since the leading-tone triad is a diminished triad, it is usually found in its first inversion . According to Carl Edward Gardner, The first inversion of the triad is considered, by many, preferable to root position . The second inversion of the triad is unusual. Some theorists forbid its use.     In a four-part chorale texture , the third of the leading-tone triad is doubled in order to avoid adding emphasis on the tritone created by the root and the fifth. Unlike a dominant chord where the leading-tone can be frustrated and not resolve to the tonic if it is in an inner voice, the leading-tone in a leading-tone triad must resolve to the tonic. Commonly, the fifth of the triad resolves down since it is phenomenologically similar to the seventh in a dominant seventh chord . All in all, the tritone resolves inward if it is written as a diminished fifth and outward if it is written as an augmented fourth .     : \\new Voice \\relative c           ": null
