The conjunction of various media is an integral element of Basquiats art. His paintings are typically covered with text and codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, map symbols, diagrams and more.      Basquiats art focused on recurrent suggestive dichotomies , such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. Hoffman, Fred.

The years 1984–85 were also the main period of the Basquiat–Warhol collaborations, even if, in general, they were not very well received by the critics. A major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book  Grays Anatomy , which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital aged seven.

A poet as well as an artist, words featured heavily in his drawings and paintings, with direct references to racism, slavery, the people and street scene of 1980s New York including other artists, and black historical figures, musicians and sports stars, as his notebooks and many important drawings demonstrate.   Often Basquiats drawings were untitled, and as such to differentiate works a word written within the drawing is commonly in parentheses after Untitled, such as with Untitled . After Basquiat died of an overdose at the age of 27, his estate was controlled by his father Gérard Basquiat, who also oversaw the committee which authenticated artworks, and operated from 1993 to 2012 to review over 1000 works, the majority of which were drawings.

Further investigation by Fred Hoffman of pieces like Masonic Lodge 1983 and Untitled in his book The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat reveals a deeper interest in the artists fascination with heads that proves an evolution in the artists oeuvre from one of raw power to one of more refined cognizance.
