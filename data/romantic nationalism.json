The Zionists preferred the Bible to the Talmud as the national literature, for the Bible tells a heroic story of the national drama whose focus is the Land of Israel. While they objected to the Haskalah politics of emancipation, Zionist thinkers also stressed the role of the Bible, but they thought of it as an element in building a particular national consciousness rather than as the basis of a shared Judeo-Christian heritage enabling the integration of Jews in Europe. Unlike the Talmud, they held, the Bible had the potential to become a national epic. Its drama unfolded in the hills of Judea, and it connected the national claim to the land with a historical past. Nothing in the Talmud, in contrast, appealed to the romanticism vital to national movements.

Romantic musical nationalism is exemplified by the work of Bedřich Smetana , especially the symphonic poem Vltava . In Scandinavia and the Slavic parts of Europe especially, national romanticism provided a series of answers to the 19th-century search for styles that would be culturally meaningful and evocative, yet not merely historicist. When a church was built over the spot in St Petersburg where Tsar Alexander II of Russia had been assassinated, the Church of the Savior on Blood , the natural style to use was one that best evoked traditional Russian features .

The foremost proponent in Finland was Akseli Gallen-Kallela .   thu , Akseli Gallen-Kallela     By the turn of the century, ethnic self-determination had become an assumption held as being progressive and liberal. There were romantic nationalist movements for separation in Finland , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , the Kingdom of Bavaria held apart from a united Germany, and Czech and Serb nationalism continued to trouble Imperial politics. The flowering of arts which drew inspiration from national epics and song continued unabated. The Zionist movement revived Hebrew, and began immigration to Eretz Yisrael , and Welsh and Irish tongues also experienced a poetic revival.       At the same time, linguistic and cultural nationality, colored with pre-genetic concepts of race, bolstered two rhetorical claims consistently associated with romantic nationalism to this day: claims of primacy and claims of superiority. Primacy is the claimed inalienable right of a culturally and racially defined people to a geographical terrain, a  heartland  or homeland . The polemics of racial superiority became inexorably intertwined with romantic nationalism. Richard Wagner notoriously argued that those who were ethnically different could not comprehend the artistic and cultural meaning inherent in national culture.

The idea was that Germans should naturally rule over lesser peoples. Romantic nationalism, which had begun as a revolt against foreign kings and overlords, had come full circle, and was being used to make the case for a Greater Germanic Empire which would rule over Europe.     The nationalistic and imperialistic tensions rising high between the European nations throughout the irrational, neo-Romantic Fin de siècle period eventually erupted in the First World War . After Germany had lost the war and undergone the tumultuous German Revolution , the völkisch movement drastically radicalized itself in Weimar Germany under the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles , and Adolf Hitler would go on to say that the basic ideas of National-Socialism are völkisch, just as the völkisch": null
