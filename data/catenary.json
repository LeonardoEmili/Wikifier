Finally, the weight of the chain is represented by  where  is the mass per unit length,  is the acceleration of gravity and  is the length of the segment of chain between  and .     The chain is in equilibrium so the sum of three forces is , therefore     : T \\cos \\varphi T_0   and   : T \\sin \\varphi \\lambda gs\\,,     and dividing these gives     : \\frac\\tan \\varphi \\frac\\,.
