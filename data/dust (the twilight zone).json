The peddler collects ordinary dirt from the ground and insists to his mark that it will spread good will throughout the crowd and will make them feel love and sympathy for the man sentenced to be hanged.     As the crowd gathers for the hanging, the father cries out and starts sprinkling the dust everywhere. To his dismay, he hears the trapdoor drop behind him and turns... to see that the fresh and sturdy rope has snapped above the noose, and his son is unharmed.
