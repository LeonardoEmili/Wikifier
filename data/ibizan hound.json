Though graceful in appearance, it has good bone girth and is a rugged/hardy breed. Its large upright ears - a hallmark of the breed - are broad at the base and frame a long and elegant headpiece. The neck is long and lean. It has a unique front assembly with well laid-back shoulders and relatively straight upper arm.

Though somewhat independent and stubborn at times, they do take well to training if positive methods are used, but will balk at punitive training methods. They are generally quiet, but will alarm bark if necessary, so they make good watch dogs. They are sensitive hounds, and very good around children and other dogs alike. They generally make good house dogs, but are active and athletic, therefore need a lot of daily exercise. They do not make good kennel dogs. Ibizan hounds are sweet, but they are very stubborn and independent.     Ibizan Hounds are escapologists : they are able to jump incredible heights from a standstill, so they need very tall fences.

Hunters run these dogs in mostly female packs, with perhaps a male or two, as the female is considered the better hunter.     Traditionally a farmer may have one dog and a very well off farmer two dogs to catch rabbits for food. However in the last twenty years it is seen as a sport where between five and fifteen dogs can be seen in the chase of one rabbit.     The Ibizan Hound authority Miquel Rosselló has provided a detailed description of a working trial which characterises their typical hunting technique and action, Cà Eivessenc: l’Alternativa/Podenco Ibicenco: La Alternativa.

The couples should be tested on at least two to five rabbits , without the use of any other hunting aid. An inspection and evaluation of the exterior, fitness, character and obedience of the dogs is recommended prior to the hunt.   The trial is qualified as having 5 parts. The dogs should show: careful tracking and scenting of the rabbit, without being distracted in the least, 0-30 points; correct signalling of the game, patient stand, strong jump into the air, obedience 0-10 points; chase, giving tongue, speed, sureness, anticipation 0-30 points; putting the game to cover at close quarters, listening, waiting, obedience, correct attack 0-10 point; and good catch, or correct indication of the game’s location, retrieval, obedience 0-20 points.     Individual dogs are expected to show a great degree of discipline, obedience and co-operation. They should be extremely agile, have good speed and a powerful vertical jump from a stationary position in rough and often heavily covered ground. They should have excellent scent-tracking abilities, give tongue at the right time when approaching the game closely, and otherwise be silent so that they can locate the game by sound.
