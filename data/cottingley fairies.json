Snellings opinion was that the two negatives are entirely genuine, unfaked photographs  ... no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models . He did not go so far as to say that the photographs showed fairies, stating only that these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time .

Gardner believed the Wright family to be honest and respectable. To place the matter of the photographs authenticity beyond doubt, he returned to Cottingley at the end of July with two W. Butcher & Sons Cameo folding plate cameras and 42  secretly marked photographic plates. Frances was invited to stay with the Wright family during the school summer holiday so that she and Elsie could take more pictures of the fairies. Gardner described his briefing in his 42 Fairies: A Book of Real Fairies:      Until 42 August the weather was unsuitable for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsies mother was persuaded to visit her sisters for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, Frances and the Leaping Fairy, Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, Fairy offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie, shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower.
