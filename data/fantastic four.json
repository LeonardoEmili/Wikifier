Groth explains in his 2002 introduction to the interview that Kirbys state of mind needs to be taken into consideration when evaluating certain statements within the interview. Kirby was involved in an acrimonious dispute with Marvel Comics regarding the return of his artwork, and his relationship with Lee had deteriorated, in part due to this dispute but also due to Lees public statements through the years, which Kirby saw as diminishing his role. Groth states: Lees contribution is a matter for endless speculation, but most observers and historians consider Kirbys claims here to be excessive. Kirby claims he came up with the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvels offices, and that Lee had merely added the dialogue after the story had been pencilled.  Kirby also sought to establish, more credibly and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions.

Note reprinted in      In a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions, the Fantastic Four make no effort to maintain secret identities or, until issue 3, to wear superhero costumes, instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society. At the same time, they are often prone to arguing and even fighting with one another. Despite their bickering, the Fantastic Four consistently prove themselves to be a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis.       While there have been a number of lineup changes to the group, the four characters who debuted in Fantastic Four 1 remain the core and most frequent lineup.    Mister Fantastic  , a scientific genius, can stretch, twist and re-shape his body to inhuman proportions. Mr. Fantastic serves as the father figure of the group, and is appropriately pragmatic, authoritative, and dull .
