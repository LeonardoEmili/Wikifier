Such values may not correspond with the rhythms of ordinary spoken English.         The hexameter was first used by early Greek poets of the oral tradition, and the most complete extant examples of their works are the  Iliad  and the  Odyssey , which influenced the authors of all later classical epics that survive today.

Electronic Book Review. 1 March 1997. Retrieved 19 May 2017.     The Homeric poems arrange words so as to create an interplay between the metrical ictus—the first syllable of each foot—and the natural, spoken accent of words. If the ictus and accent coincide too frequently the hexameter becomes sing-songy . Thus in general, word breaks occur in the middle of metrical feet, while ictus and accent coincide more often near the end of the line.   The first line of Homer’s Iliad— Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus’ son Achilles —provides an example:     :     Dividing the line into metrical units:     :  dactyl, dactyl, spondee, dactyl, dactyl, spondee.     Note how the word endings do not coincide with the end of a metrical foot; for the early part of the line this forces the accent of each word to lie in the middle of a foot, playing against the ictus.     This line also includes a masculine caesura after , a break that separates the line into two parts. Homer employs a feminine caesura more commonly than later writers: an example occurs in Iliad I.5 ...and every bird; thus the plan of Zeus came to fulfillment :     :   :   :     Homer’s hexameters contain a higher proportion of dactyls than later hexameter poetry. They are also characterised by a laxer following of verse principles than later epicists almost invariably adhered to. For example, Homer allows spondaic fifth feet , whereas many later authors never do.     Homer also altered the forms of words to allow them to fit the hexameter, typically by using a ": null

        " form: ptolis is an epic form used instead of the Attic polis as necessary for the meter. Proper names sometimes take forms to fit the meter, for example Pouludamas instead of the metrically unviable Poludamas.     Note also that some lines require a knowledge of the digamma for their scansion, e.g. Iliad I.108 you have not yet spoken a good word nor brought one to pass :     :     Here the word  was originally  in Ionian; the digamma, later lost, lengthened the last syllable of the preceding  and removed the apparent defect in the meter. A digamma also saved the hiatus in the third foot. This example demonstrates the oral tradition of the Homeric epics that flourished before they were written down sometime in the 7th century BC.     In spite of the occasional exceptions in early epic, most of the later rules of hexameter composition have their origins in the methods and practices of Homer.            The hexameter came into Latin as an adaptation from Greek long after the practice of singing the epics had faded. Consequentially, the properties of the meter were learned as specific rules rather than as a natural result of musical expression. Also, because the Latin language generally has a higher proportion of long syllables than Greek, it is by nature more spondaic. Thus the Latin hexameter took on characteristics of its own.

        "opening line for the  Aeneid  is a classic example::     :   : I sing of arms and the man, who first from the shores of Troy...     As in Greek, lines were arranged so that the metrically long syllables—those occurring at the beginning of a foot—often avoided the natural stress of a word. In the earlier feet of a line, meter and stress were expected to clash, while in the later feet they were expected to resolve and coincide—an effect that gives each line a natural dum-ditty-dum-dum rhythm to close. Such an arrangement is a balance between an exaggerated emphasis on the metre—which would cause the verse to be sing-songy—and the need to provide some repeated rhythmic guide for skilled recitation.     In the following example of Enniuss early Latin hexameter composition, metrical weight  falls on the first and last syllables of ; the ictus is therefore opposed to the natural stress on the second syllable when the word is pronounced. Similarly, the second syllable of the words  and  carry the metrical ictus even though the first is naturally stressed in typical pronunciation. In the closing feet of the line, the natural stress that falls on the third syllable of  and the second syllable of  coincide with the metrical ictus and produce the characteristic shave and a haircut ending:     :    : they were disputing whether they should call the city Roma or Remora.     Like their Greek predecessors, classical Latin poets avoided a large number of word breaks at the ends of foot divisions except between the fourth and fifth, where it was encouraged. In order to preserve the rhythmic close, Latin poets avoided the placement of a single syllable or four-syllable word at the end of a line. The caesura is also handled far more strictly, with Homers feminine caesura becoming exceedingly rare, and the second-foot caesura always paired with one in the fourth.     One example of the evolution of the Latin verse form can be seen in a comparative analysis of the use of spondees in Ennius time vs. the Augustan age. The repeated use of the heavily spondaic line came to be frowned upon, as well as the use of a high proportion of spondees in both of the first two feet. The following lines of Ennius would not have been felt admissible by later authors since they both contain repeated spondees at the beginning of consecutive lines:     :   :    : with these words: o daughter, tribulations must first be borne by you;   :later your fortune will rise again from the river.     However, it is from Virgil that the following famous, heavily spondaic line comes:     :    : a huge, shapeless, horrendous monster, whose light had been removed         By the age of Augustus, poets like Virgil closely followed the rules of the meter and approached it in a highly rhetorical way, looking for effects that can be exploited in skilled recitation. For example, the following line from the Aeneid describes the movement of rushing horses and how a hoof shakes the crumbling field with a galloping sound :   :     This line is made up of five dactyls and a closing spondee, an unusual rhythmic arrangement that imitates the described action. A similar effect is found in VIII.452, where Virgil describes how the blacksmith sons of Vulcan lift their arms with great strength one to another in forging Aeneas shield:   :     The line consists of all spondees except for the usual dactyl in the fifth foot, and is meant to mimic the pounding sound of the work. A third example that mixes the two effects comes from I.42, where Juno pouts that Athena was allowed to use Joves thunderbolts to destroy Ajax :     :     This line is nearly all dactyls except for the spondee at -lata e. This change in rhythm paired with the harsh elision is intended to emphasize the crash of Athenas thunderbolt.     Virgil will occasionally deviate from the strict rules of the meter to produce a special effect. One example from I.105 describing a ship at sea during a storm has Virgil violating metrical standards to place a single-syllable word at the end of the line:   :   :     The boat gives its side to the waves; there comes next in a heap a steep mountain of water. By placing the monosyllable mons at the end of the line, Virgil interrupts the usual shave and a haircut pattern to produce a jarring rhythm, an effect that echoes the crash of a large wave against the side of a ship.
