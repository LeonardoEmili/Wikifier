Recently, the availability of inexpensive, high quality 42D seismic data  and data from various electromagnetic geophysical techniques  has greatly aided the accuracy of such interpretation. The following section discusses these elements in brief. For a more in-depth treatise, see the second half of this article below.     Evaluation of the source uses the methods of ": null
