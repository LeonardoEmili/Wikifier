At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force . The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.

Simple experiments showed that Galileos understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crows nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.     Moreover, any object traveling at a constant velocity must be subject to zero net force .

In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line  traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram.
