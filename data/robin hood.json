There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature, film, and television. Robin Hood is considered one of the best known tales of English folklore.     The historicity of Robin Hood is not proven and has been debated for centuries. There are numerous references to historical figures with similar names that have been proposed as possible evidence of his existence, some dating back to the late 13th century. At least eight plausible origins to the story have been mooted by historians and folklorists, including suggestions that Robin Hood was a stock alias used by or in reference to bandits.       The first clear reference to rhymes of Robin Hood is from the alliterative poem  Piers Plowman , thought to have been composed in the 1370s, but the earliest surviving copies of the narrative ballads that tell his story date to the second half of the 15th century, or the first decade of the 16th century.

The oldest surviving ballad,  Robin Hood and the Monk , gives even less support to the picture of Robin Hood as a partisan of the true king. The setting of the early ballads is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th century or the 14th, although it is recognised they are not necessarily historically consistent.

It was here that he encountered and assimilated into his own legend the jolly friar and Maid Marian, almost invariably among the performers in the 16th century morris dance, Dobson and Taylor have suggested that theories on the origin of Friar Tuck often founder on a failure to recognise that he was the product of the fusion between two very different friars, a bellicose outlaw, and the May Games figure.

Each of these three ballads survived in a single copy, so it is unclear how much of the medieval legend has survived, and what has survived may not be typical of the medieval legend. It has been argued that the fact that the surviving ballads were preserved in written form in itself makes it unlikely they were typical; in particular, stories with an interest for the gentry were by this view more likely to be preserved.

The fifteenth-century ballads relate that before he died, Robin told Little John where to bury him. He shot an arrow from the Priory window, and where the arrow landed was to be the site of his grave. The Gest states that the Prioress was a relative of Robins. Robin was ill and staying at the Priory where the Prioress was supposedly caring for him. However, she betrayed him, his health worsened, and he eventually died there.

        ", this theory has now largely been abandoned by professional historians.         Another theory is that Robin Hood died at Kirkby, Pontefract. Draytons Poly-Olbion Song 28 composed in 1622 speaks of Robin Hoods death and clearly states that the outlaw died at Kirkby. David Hepworth, A Grave Tale , in Robin Hood: Medieval and Post-Medieval, ed. by Helen Phillips pp. 91–112 This is consistent with the view that Robin Hood operated in the Went Valley, located three miles to the southeast of the town of Pontefract. The location is approximately three miles from the site of Robins robberies at the now famous Saylis. In the Anglo-Saxon period, Kirkby was home to All Saints Church. All Saints Church had a priory hospital attached to it. The Tudor historian Richard Grafton stated that the prioress who murdered Robin Hood buried the outlaw beside the road,     Where he had used to rob and spoyle those that passed that way ... and the cause why she buryed him there was, for that common strangers and travailers, knowing and seeing him there buryed, might more safely and without feare take their journeys that way, which they durst not do in the life of the sayd outlaes. Grafton, Richard, A Chronicle at Large p. 84 in Early English Books Online.     All Saints Church at Kirkby, modern Pontefract, which was located approximately three miles from the site of Robin Hoods robberies at the Saylis, is consistent with Richard Graftons description because a road ran directly from Wentbridge to the hospital at Kirkby. La Chance, A, The Origins and Development of Robin Hood . Kapelle, William E., The Norman Conquest of the North: The Region and Its Transformation, 1000–1135 .            Within close proximity of Wentbridge reside several notable landmarks relating to Robin Hood. One such place-name location occurred in a cartulary deed of 1422 from Monkbretton Priory, which makes direct reference to a landmark named Robin Hoods Stone, which resided upon the eastern side of the Great North Road, a mile south of Barnsdale Bar. Monkbretton Priory, Abstracts of the Chartularies of the Priory of Monkbretton, Vol. LXVI, ed. by J.W. Walker p. 105. The historians Barry Dobson and John Taylor suggested that on the opposite side of the road once stood Robin Hoods Well, which has since been relocated six miles north-west of Doncaster, on the south-bound side of the Great North Road.
