Childs fourth book, From Julia Childs Kitchen, was illustrated with her husbands photographs and documented the color series of The French Chef, as well as provided an extensive library of kitchen notes compiled by Child during the course of the show.        Julia Child had a large impact on American households and housewives. Because of the technology in the 1960s, the show was unedited, causing her blunders to appear in the final version and ultimately lend authenticity and approachability to television. Toby Miller.

In a 1990 interview, Child said, Everybody is overreacting. If fear of food continues, it will be the death of gastronomy in the United States.
