He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of  around London. Dickenss sister-in-law wrote how he wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition . Slater says that A Christmas Carol was     intended to open its readers hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.

Dickenss hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph ...  and to Tiny Tim, who did not die ; this was added later, during the printing process.          The central character of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based moneylender, described in the story as a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!  Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickenss conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man. The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooges lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty is something of a self-parody of Dickenss fears about himself ; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.

Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from The Pickwick Papers was also an influence when creating Scrooge.

The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as mean man .

        ".     Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol in response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularly child poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.          As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit, Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.

Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print. It was Dickenss most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.     The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £42  rather than the £42  he expected. A year later, the profits were only £42 and Dickens was deeply disappointed.          According to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of A Christmas Carol were almost uniformly kind .  The Illustrated London News  described how the storys impressive eloquence  ... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour  ... its gentle spirit of humanity all put the reader in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author .
