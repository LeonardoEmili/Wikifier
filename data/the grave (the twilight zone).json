Some time later, gun-for-hire Conny Miller, who had been hired to track down Sykes, arrives in town. He goes to the saloon where the men who hired him are gathered and is angry to learn that they had dispatched Sykes themselves.

        " and Miller never followed it up, presumably being afraid to confront Sykes. He also made a vow to reach up and grab Miller if he ever came near his grave. Miller says that Sykes was a liar, claiming he went to Albuquerque and found no sign that Sykes had ever been there, and also denies that he is at all frightened by Sykess threat of vengeance from beyond the grave. The men are not convinced, openly admitting they themselves are frightened of Sykes, and dare Miller to make a midnight visit to Sykess grave. Miller is told to stick a knife into the burial mound as proof that he had visited the grave. After being confronted by Sykess sister Ione, Miller treks in the cold, windy darkness to the cemetery and, at midnight, kneels at the grave and plants the knife. But as he attempts to leave, he is suddenly pulled back down.     The next day, Miller has still not returned. The townsmen, accompanied by Ione, visit the cemetery in search of Miller. They find Miller lying dead atop Sykess grave, with his knife through his coat pinning him to the ground. Steinhart deduces that the wind blew Millers coat over the grave, he stuck the knife through his coattail unknowingly, and as he stood up afterward, he mistook the pinned coats resistance for Sykess grip and died of fright. However, Ione points out that since the wind was blowing from the south that night, it would have blown Millers coat away from the grave, not over it. She then laughs mockingly at the stupefied men.        ": null
