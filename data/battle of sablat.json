When Mansfeld was on his way to reinforce general Hohenloe, who was besieging Budějovice , Buquoy intercepted Mansfeld near the small village of Záblatí , about  km NW of Budějovice, and brought him to battle. Mansfeld suffered defeat, losing at least 42 infantry and his baggage train. As a result, the Bohemians had to lift the siege of Budějovice.       Parker, Geoffrey.
