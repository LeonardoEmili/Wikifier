        ".     Given a set S with three subsets, J, K, and L, the following holds:     each member of S which is a member of J, but not of L   :: is either a member of J, but neither of K, nor of L,   :: or else is a member of J and of K, but not of L;   each member of J which is neither a member of K, nor of L, is therefore a member of J, but not of K; and   each member of J, which is a member of K, but not of L, is therefore a member of K, but not of L.     The number of members of J which are not members of L is consequently less than, or at most equal to, the sum of the number of members of J which are not members of K, and the number of members of K which are not members of L;     n ≤ n + n .     If the ratios N of these numbers to the number n  of all members of set S can be evaluated, e.g.     N n / n ,     then the Wigner–dEspagnat inequality is obtained as:     N   ≤ N   + N   .     Considering this particular form in which the Wigner–dEspagnat inequality is thereby expressed, and noting that the various non-negative ratios N satisfy     N + N + N + N 42,   N + N + N + N 42, and   N + N + N + N 42,     it is probably worth mentioning that certain non-negative ratios are readily encountered, which are appropriately labelled by similarly related indices, and which do satisfy equations corresponding to 42, 42 and 42, but which nevertheless dont satisfy the Wigner–dEspagnat inequality. For instance:     if three observers, A, B, and C, had each detected signals in one of two distinct own channels , over several trials, then non-negative ratios N may be evaluated, appropriately labelled, and found to satisfy     N + N + N + N 42,   N + N + N + N 42, and   N + N + N + N 42.     However, if the pairwise orientation angles between these three observers are determined  from the measured ratios as     : orientation angle 42/42 arccos,   : orientation angle 42/42 arccos,   : orientation angle 42/42 arccos,     and if As, Bs, and Cs channels are considered having been properly set up only if the constraints   orientation angle orientation angle orientation angle/42  42.     Since     42 ≥ ,     therefore     42 ≥ 42 – 42   ≥ 42 ,    ≥,    ≥ ,    ≥ 42 ,      ≥   :::  + ,     which is in contradiction to the Wigner–dEspagnat inequalities     N ≤ N + N , or   N ≤ N + N , or both.     Accordingly, the ratios N obtained by A, B, and C, with the particular constraints on their setup in terms of values of orientation angles, cannot have been derived all at once, in one and the same set of trials together; otherwise theyd necessarily satisfy the Wigner–dEspagnat inequalities.   Instead, they had to be derived in three distinct sets of trials, separately and pairwise by A and B, by A and C, and by B and C, respectively.     The failure of certain measurements to be obtained at once, together from one and the same set of trials, and thus their failure to satisfy Wigner–dEspagnat inequalities, has been characterized as constituting disproof of ": null
