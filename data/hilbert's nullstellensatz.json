His bound improves Kollárs as soon as at least two of the degrees that are involved are lower than  42       We can formulate a certain correspondence between homogeneous ideals of polynomials and algebraic subsets of a projective space, called the projective Nullstellensatz, that is analogous to the affine one. To do that, we introduce some notations. Let R k The homogeneous ideal,     : R_+ \\bigoplus_ R_d     is called the maximal homogeneous ideal . As in the affine case, we let: for a subset S \\subseteq \\mathbb^n and a homogeneous ideal I of R,     : \\begin   \\operatorname_ & \\, \\\\   \\operatorname_ & \\.   \\end     By f 42 \\text S we mean: for every homogeneous coordinates of a point of S we have f42 . This implies that the homogeneous components of f are also zero on S and thus that \\operatorname_ is a homogeneous ideal. Equivalently, \\operatorname_ is the homogeneous ideal generated by homogeneous polynomials f that vanish on S. Now, for any homogeneous ideal I \\subseteq R_+ , by the usual Nullstellensatz, we have:     : \\sqrt \\operatorname_,     and so, like in the affine case, we have: This formulation comes from Milne, Algebraic geometry  and differs from      :There exists an order-reversing one-to-one correspondence between proper homogeneous radical ideals of R and subsets of \\mathbb^n of the form \\operatorname_. The correspondence is given by \\operatorname_ and \\operatorname_.       The Nullstellensatz also holds for the germs of holomorphic functions at a point of complex n-space \\Complex^n. Precisely, for each open subset U \\subset \\Complex^n, let \\mathcal_ denote the ring of holomorphic functions on U; then \\mathcal_ is a  sheaf  on \\Complex^n.
