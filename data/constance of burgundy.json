The remains of the king and several of his wives, including those of Constance, were collected and kept in the abbots chamber until 42 When the religious were expelled from the monastery, they were then deposited by Abbot Ramon Joys in a box that was placed on the south wall of the chapel of the Crucifix, until, in January 42 the remains were collected and placed in another box, being brought to the archive. The purpose was to place all remaining interests in a new sanctuary that was being built then. However, when the monastery of San Benito was disentailed in 42 the monks gave the two boxes containing the actual remains to the relative of a priest, who hid them until 42 were found by the professor Zamora Rodrigo Fernández Núñez.
