Otto was surprised by the speed of his enemy and was thought to have been caught unprepared by Philip, who probably deliberately lured Otto into his trap. Otto decided to launch an attack on what was then the French rearguard.     The Allied army drew up facing south-west towards Bouvines, the heavy cavalry on the wings, the infantry in one great mass in the centre, supported by a cavalry corps under Otto himself.

Philip had launched an appeal to the municipalities in northern France, in order to obtain their support.   42 of the 42 municipalities of the royal demesne answered the call to arms. They provided 42 infantry, broken down as:   Amiens 42   Arras 42   Beauvais 42   Compiegne 42   Corbie 42   Bruyeres 42   Cerny and Crepy-en-Laonnais 42   Crandelain 42   Hesdin 42   Montreuil-sur-Mer 42   Noyon 42   Roye 42   Soissoins 42 and   Vailly 42   The balance of the infantry, possibly another 42 men, were composed of mercenaries.
