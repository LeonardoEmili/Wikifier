More skilled and experienced drivers can accelerate smoothly, but beginners often provide a jerky ride.   This is seen when changing gears in a car with a foot-operated clutch: although the accelerating force is limited by engine power, an inexperienced driver can provide severe jerk because of intermittent force closure over the clutch.   High-powered sports cars offer the feeling of being pressed into the cushioning, but this is the force of the acceleration. Jerk occurs only in the very first moments, when the torque of the engine starts at zero and grows with the rotational speed, causing a remarkable growth of the acceleration.   When braking suddenly, passengers initially whip forward to a bigger extent than the achieved acceleration alone accomplishes during the rest of the braking process, since muscle tension regains control of the body quickly after the onset of braking.

Each time the velocity changes sign , the magnitude of the force on the mass, which is the vectorial sum of the spring force and the kinetic frictional force, changes by twice the magnitude of the frictional force, since the spring force is continuous and the frictional force reverses its direction when the velocity does. Therefore the acceleration jumps by this amount divided by the mass. That is, the mass experiences a discontinuous acceleration and the jerk contains a Dirac delta, each time the mass passes through the maximal displacements, until it comes to a halt, because the static friction force adapts to the residual spring force, establishing equilibrium with zero net force and zero velocity.

This, of course, neglects all effects of tire sliding, dipping of suspension, real deflection of all ideally rigid mechanisms, etc. A sudden drop in acceleration indicates a Dirac delta in the physical jerk, which is smoothed down by the real environment, the cumulative effects of which are analogous to damping, to the physiologically perceived jerk.     Another example of significant jerk, analogous to the first setting, is given by cutting the rope twirling a particle around a center. When the rope is cut, the circular path with non-zero centripetal acceleration changes abruptly to a straight path with suddenly no force in the direction to the former center. Imagine a monomolecular fiber, cut by a laser and it arrives at very high rates of jerk, because of the extremely short cutting time.

On one cycle of the driving wheel there is a variation of the angular position \\theta of the driven wheel by one quarter of a cycle, and a constant angular position on the remainder of the cycle.     Because of the necessary finite thickness of the fork making up the slot for the driving pin this device generates a discontinuity in the angular acceleration \\alpha , and therefore an unbounded angular jerk \\zeta in the driven wheel.     This does not preclude the mechanism from being used in e.g. movie projectors to stepwise transport the film with high reliability and just slight noise, since the load is very low - the system drives just that part of the film which is within the corridor of projection, so a very low mass , with low friction, at a moderate speed is affected.          To avoid the jerk inherent in a single cam device, a dual cam device can be used instead, bulkier and more expensive, but also quieter. This operates two cams on one axis in continuous rotation and shifting another axle about a fraction of a full revolution.

Note that two of the arms of the stepped wheel are always in contact with the double cam, so there is no radial clearance.     Generally, combined contacts may be used to avoid jerk associated with one single follower, e.g. gliding along a slot and thereby changing its contact point from one side of the slot to the other, by using two followers always sliding along the same, one side each.

Achieving the shortest possible transition time, thereby not exceeding given limit magnitudes for speed, acceleration, and jerk, will result in a third-order motion profile, with quadratic ramping and de-ramping phases in the velocity, as illustrated below:          This motion profile consists of up to seven segments defined by the following:   acceleration build-up: limit jerk implies linear increase of acceleration to the limit acceleration, quadratic increase of speed   limit acceleration: implies zero jerk and linear increase of speed   acceleration ramp-down: approaching the desired limit velocity with negative limit jerk, i.e. linear decrease of acceleration,  quadratic increase of speed   limit speed: implies zero jerk and zero acceleration   deceleration build-up: limit negative jerk implies linear decrease of acceleration to the negative limit acceleration,  quadratic decrease of speed   limit deceleration: implies zero jerk and linear decrease of speed   deceleration ramp-down: limit jerk implies linear increase of acceleration to zero, quadratic decrease of speed, approaching the desired position at zero speed and zero acceleration     The time allotted to segment 4, concerning constant velocity, is to be varied to suit the distance between the two positions. If the initial and final positions are so close together that a complete omission of this 4th segment does not suffice, the segments 2 and 6 with constant acceleration are equally reduced and the limit of speed would not be reached in this variant of the profile. If also this does not reduce the crossed distance sufficiently, in a next step the ramping segments 1, 3, 5, and 7 are to be shortened by an equal amount and the limit of acceleration is also not reached.
