A number of independent transitions to a herbaceous habit in the ancestors of Crassulaceae, Saxifragaceae and the base of the Haloragaceae-Penthoraceae clade, the other two families in Haloragaceae s.l. remaining woody, while other taxa reverted to a woody habit, especially Crassulaceae. Most of Saxifragaleshave a superior ovary, but some families show frequent transition with inferior or subinferior position, particularly Saxifragaceae and to a lesser extent Hamamelidaceae. Almost all Grossulariaceae have an inferior ovary. The ancestral carpel number is two, with transition to higher numbers, such as four in Haloragaceae s.l. and Peridiscaceae with five in Penthoraceae. The ancestral number for Crassulaceae is two, decreasing to Kalanchoe, where it is synapomorphic, though the most frequent transition in this family is 6–10, but only where stamen number is increased above five. Some Macronesian taxa have 8–12, with up to 32 carpels for Aeonium.     The ancestral petal number is five, with three major transitions; 5 to 0, 5 to 4, 5 to 6–10. Increased petal number is seen in Paeoniaceae and Crassulaceae, particularly where stamen number is also increased. Cercidiphyllum + Daphniphyllum, Chrysosplenium and Altingia are examples of the complete loss of petals. The ancestral stamen:petal ratio is 1, with transitions characterising several clades, e.g. Paeonicaceae+woody clade              ": null
