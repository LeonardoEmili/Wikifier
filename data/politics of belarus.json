Claiming violations in the signature collection drive, 42 deputies voted against the referendum; only thirty-five deputies supported it, and another thirty-five abstained. In view of the fact that in May 42 the Central Referendum Commission had validated 42 of the 42 signatures collected , the BPF opposition accused the Supreme Soviets conservative majority of an open violation of the republics constitution and of an attempt to retain power by illegal means. Nonetheless, the opposition won a small victory in this tug-of-war: the parliament agreed to shorten its five-year term by one year and scheduled the next elections for the spring of 42     Kebichs government consisted of former CPB functionaries and took a very conservative approach to economic and political reforms. Kyebich himself characterized his policy as traditional and warned about taking extreme positions.     Belarus conservative Supreme Soviet continued to put obstacles in the path of reform. A privatization law was finally passed in July 42 but it allowed collective and state farms to continue to exist and operate. Privatization of state-owned enterprises had barely begun in mid42 despite earlier efforts by Shushkevich, who was largely a figurehead, to move along reform efforts.

Lukashenko even called for outright unification with Russia, but it was his anti-corruption stance that allowed him to defeat Kebich in the runoff with 42 percent of the vote.       After Lukashenko achieved his victory, the BPF granted him a three-month grace period during which it did not openly criticize his policies. Because his campaign promises had often been vague, he had great latitude within which to operate. And because Kyebich resigned after the election, taking his government with him, there were no problems in removing ministers.     Lukashenkos presidency was one of contradictions from the start. His cabinet was composed of young, talented newcomers as well as Kebich veterans who had not fully supported Kebich. As a reward to the parliament for confirming his appointees, Lukashenko supported the move to postpone the parliamentary elections until May 42     Lukashenkos government was also plagued by corrupt members. Lukashenko fired the minister of defense, the armed forces chief of staff, the head of the border guards, and the minister of forestry. Following resignations among reformists in Lukashenkos cabinet, parliamentary deputy Syarhey Antonchyk read a report in parliament on December 42 42 about corruption in the administration. Although Lukashenko refused to accept the resignations that followed, the government attempted to censor the report, fueling the oppositions criticism of Lukashenko.     Lukashenko went to Russia in August 42 on his first official visit abroad as head of state. There he came to realize that Russia would not make any unusual efforts to accommodate Belarus, especially its economic needs. Nevertheless, Lukashenko kept trying; in February 42 Belarus signed the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation with Russia, making many concessions to Russia, such as allowing the stationing of Russian troops in Belarus, in hopes that Russia would return the favor by charging Belarus lower prices for fuels. However, because the treaty included no such provision, there was little hope of realizing this objective.     Lukashenko had several disputes with parliament, mainly over the limits of presidential power . A hunger strike by opposition deputies, led by ": null

    {
        ", began on April 42 42 after Lukashenko proposed four questions for a referendum and then stated that the referendum would be held regardless of parliaments vote. The protest ended when the striking deputies, forcibly evicted in the middle of the night during a search for an alleged bomb, found that the national television and radio building had been cordoned off as well because of another alleged bomb threat. After this incident, the parliament gave in on a number of matters, including the four referendum questions, because word of their strike now could not be publicized.     The parliamentary elections held in May 42 were less than successful or democratic. The restrictions placed on the mass media and on the candidates expenditures during the campaign led to a shortage of information about the candidates and almost no political debate before the elections. In several cases, no one candidate received the necessary majority of the votes in the May 42 elections, prompting another round on May 42 The main problem in the second round was the lack of voter turnout. In several districts, the results had to be discarded because the number of voters fell short of the minimum turnout of 42 percent. This left parliament in limbo because it had only 42 elected deputies, short of the 42 required for a quorum. Another round of elections was discussed, probably near the end of the year, but the government claimed to have no money to finance them.       Of the 42 deputies to the Belarusian Supreme Soviet elected in 42 fourteen were still vacant three years later, owing to voter apathy. There was also widespread apathy toward the political process and disbelief that what were being advertised as democratic ways would improve the situation. This general political malaise was then, and continued to be in 42 reflected in the feeble growth, small size, and low popularity of political parties.     Although the 42 and 42 parliamentary elections were far from democratic, the predominance of conservatives in the legislature had deeper roots than just the lack of means for free expression and the strictures of the electoral procedure. A widely heard rhetorical question was, What is more useful, sausage or freedom? The conservative majority in parliament—largely managers, administrators, and representatives of such groups as war veterans and collective and state farm managers—had successfully slowed the pace of reforms, and the standard of living had decreased dramatically for most of the population.

An example of political inertia is the debate on relations between Russia and Belarus. This debate has proceeded rather noisily and has been couched in cultural and historical terms, rather than in terms of the states interests.

The United Democratic Party of Belarus was founded in November 42 and was the first political party in independent Belarus other than the communist party. Its membership is composed of technical intelligentsia, professionals, workers, and peasants. It seeks an independent Belarus, democracy, freedom of ethnic expression, and a market economy.     The Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly emerged in March 42 Its members include workers, peasants, students, military personnel, and urban and rural intelligentsia. Its program advocates an independent Belarus, which does not rule out membership in the CIS, and a market economy with state regulation of certain sectors. The assembly cooperates with other parties and considers itself part of the worldwide social democratic movement.     The Belarusian Peasant Party, founded in February 42 is headquartered in Minsk and has branches in most voblasts. The partys goals include privatization of land, a free market, a democratic government, and support of Belarusian culture and humanism.     The Belarusian Christian Democratic Union, founded in June 42 was a continuation of the Belarusian Christian-Democratic Party, which was disbanded by the Polish authorities in western Belarus in the 42s. Its membership consists mainly of the intelligentsia, and it espouses Christian values, nonviolence, pluralism, private property, and peaceful relations among ethnic groups.     The Belaya Rus Slavic Council was founded in June 42 as a conservative Russophile group that defends Russian interests in all spheres of social life, vociferously objects to the status of Belarusian as the republics sole official language, and demands equal status for the Russian language.
