After resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote  The Hound of the Baskervilles  .

In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes claims to be unaware that the earth revolves around the sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces ones ability to learn useful things. The later stories move away from this notion: in  The Valley of Fear , he says, All knowledge comes useful to the detective , and in The Adventure of the Lions Mane , the detective calls himself an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles .
