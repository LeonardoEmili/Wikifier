There is a standard Lagrangian submanifold given by \\R^n_ \\to \\R^_ .

The cotangent bundle of a manifold is locally modeled on a space similar to the first example. It can be shown that we can glue these affine symplectic forms hence this bundle forms a symplectic manifold. A more non-trivial example of a Lagrangian submanifold is the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold. For example, let     : X \\.     Then, we can present T^X as     : T^X \\     where we are treating the symbols \\mathrmx,\\mathrmy as coordinates of \\R^4 T^\\R^2.

This example can be repeated for any manifold defined by the vanishing locus of smooth functions f_1,\\ldots,f_k and their differentials \\mathrmf_1,\\ldots,df_k .     Another useful class of Lagrangian submanifolds can be found using Morse theory. Given a Morse function f:M\\to\\R and for a small enough \\varepsilon one can construct a Lagrangian submanifold given by the vanishing locus \\mathbb \\subset T^M .
