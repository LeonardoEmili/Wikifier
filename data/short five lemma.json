The essence of the lemma can be summarized as follows: if you have a homomorphism f from an object B to an object B & prime;, and this homomorphism induces an isomorphism from a subobject A of B to a subobject A & prime; of B & prime; and also an isomorphism from the factor object B/A to B & prime;/A & prime;, then f itself is an isomorphism. Note however that the existence of f has to be assumed from the start; two objects B and B & prime; that simply have isomorphic sub- and factor objects need not themselves be isomorphic ": null
