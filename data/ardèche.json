The small plains are very fertile and favourable to orchards at first and on the slopes the vines dominate.     Maps of different types of agricultural products translate clearly into these five regions. The true character of the Ardèche is according to A. Siegfried, of a slope turning towards the Mediterranean, open to the influences coming from the Midi. These influences climb the length of the valleys to the summit of the high plateau, which resists their passage, not letting them penetrate.
