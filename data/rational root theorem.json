        "; this does not alter the set of rational roots and only strengthens the divisibility conditions. That lemma says that if the polynomial factors in , then it also factors in  as a product of primitive polynomials. Now any rational root  corresponds to a factor of degree 1 in  of the polynomial, and its primitive representative is then , assuming that  and  are coprime. But any multiple in  of  has leading term divisible by  and constant term divisible by , which proves the statement. This argument shows that more generally, any irreducible factor of  can be supposed to have integer coefficients, and leading and constant coefficients dividing the corresponding coefficients of  .             In the polynomial     : 2x^3+x-1,     any rational root fully reduced would have to have a numerator that divides evenly into 1 and a denominator that divides evenly into 2. Hence the only possible rational roots are ±1/2 and ±1; since neither of these equates the polynomial to zero, it has no rational roots.       In the polynomial     : x^3-7x+6     the only possible rational roots would have a numerator that divides 6 and a denominator that divides 1, limiting the possibilities to ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. Of these, 1, 2, and –3 equate the polynomial to zero, and hence are its rational roots.
