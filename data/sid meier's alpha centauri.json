GURPS characterizes Skye as a formidable scientist and engineer , and many of her faction the same. She worked for the Red Cross and the U.N. Disaster Relief Fund improving strains of crop plants. Committed environmentalists, the Gaians seek development without harming native life. While their environmentalism isnt quite a religion, they enjoy meditation and Skye has written a number of pseudo-religious works. Among the first to discover the potential of psionics. Democratic and pacifistic. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.32-33. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Chairman Sheng-Ji Yang of the Human Hive, former scholar, military officer and U.N.S. Unity Chief of Security and executive officer. GURPS characterizes Yang as incorruptible if profoundly nihilistic, with an extraordinarily deep and powerful mind, perfect recall and iron will. A teacher, psychologist, and master of calligraphy, poetry, painting, and martial arts, Yang obtained degrees in Chinese literature and military history before eventually becoming the Emperors personal confidant and security commander during the Second Golden Revolution. Despising democracy, Yang is dedicated to the construction of a secure and perfectly controlled society.

Famous for groundbreaking work in both high-energy physics and artificial intelligence , Zakharov worked in the Russian Ministry of Defense and was one of the first world leaders who proposed the Unity project. He sat on the final crew selection board, winning the position of Chief Science Officer. His University faction is devoted to rational, scientific inquiry. Though Zakharov is impatient with ethical arguments not framed in purely logical terms , the faction is committed to intellectual honesty, supporting the free flow of information, and have an open society. Zakharov and his followers value a deep understanding of the physical universe, and the mastery of physical systems that comes from such understanding. However, this can lead to an undervaluing of non-scientific citizens. Democratic, though only among the academic class, which has a strict hierarchy. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.48-50. GURPS Alpha Centauri   CEO Nwabudike Morgan , of Morgan Industries, a Namibian diamond tycoon who funded the U.N.S. Unity mission. GURPS gives Morgans background as having built a world-class business empire, and characterizes him as self confident and remarkably resourceful, reestablishing Morgan Industries on Planet and laying long-term plans for monopoly over all human endeavor. Having few ethical values apart from the businessmans Code of Honor, he preaches greed as a social virtue. His faction is devoted to free-market capitalism, and libertarian, emphasizing free economic choices and contracts, and property holding. Citizens are encouraged to set up businesses of their own, pursue private trade opportunities or act as subcontractors. In practice they have revived tycoons and employees, and most decisions of any importance take place in corporate boardrooms. Devoted to luxuries and consumer goods. Recognize U.N. authority. Unregulated; no charity. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.37-39. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Colonel Corazon Santiago , of the Spartan Federation, a Puerto Rican militiawoman and former U.N.S. Unity security officer. GURPS gives the Spartans background in an Earth survivalist movement of the 2050s with extensive political connections, the Spartan Coalition, discreetly giving Colonel Corazon Santiago second-in-command of the ships Security detachment along with placement of other members. Born in Puerto Rico in 2026 before her family moved to Mexico, Santiago was orphaned in 2034 and would join the Jade Falcons gang. She made her way to California New Los Angeles, where she served as part of a community security force before joining the City Guard. She is characterized as determined to survive at any cost . Though claiming not to be aggressive, Spartans simply consider the universe hostile, and have a strong warrior ethic, considering it better to be strong, always ready to fight for ones life or personal ambitions. Best trained and most motivated soldiers on Planet. Austere; practice infanticide and dueling. Military education. A military dictatorship, though every command-grade officer has a personal staff of advisors by way of which ideas and complaints can filter up through the hierarchy. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.46-48. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Sister Miriam Godwinson , of the Lords Believers, an American minister and social psychologist and former U.N.S. chaplain. GURPS characterizes her as a fanatic of Conclave Christianity with a sense of duty and appreciation for debate. Her faction is characterized as fanatic, spiritual, austere and mistrusting in science . Despite this, they are open to differing interpretations for the implementation of doctrine, and their ideology is based on both worship and dissent. Led by ministers, they see planet as a promised land. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.23-25. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Commissioner Pravin Lal , of the Peacekeeping Forces, an Indian surgeon and diplomat . ": null

Charter , a democrat, pacifist and strong idealist, the epitome of the best nature of Earths world community. With degrees in philosophy and medicine from Oxford University, following his work as a surgeon he served in the World Health Organization. His faction regards itself as the last extension of U.N. authority on Planet , supporting the humanitarian and democratic ideals of Earths U.N. , and more specifically the so-called Four Freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear - and a statement of universal human rights. They believe that they have a crucial role to play in the construction of a just and humane civilization on Planet , and value exploration and scientific discovery as tools toward that end. True free expression is probably more unbounded among the Peacekeepers than in any other faction. Hope to reunite all the factions. Well managed and stable, if less efficient . Representative, with a strong elected executive. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.40-41. GURPS Alpha Centauri     The seven additional faction leaders in Alien Crossfire are:   Prime Function Aki Zeta-Five , of The Cybernetic Consciousness, a Norwegian research assistant-turned-cyborg. GURPS characterizes her as detached and utterly pragmatic, and gives her a doctorate in computer science specializing in artificial intelligence. She had earth connections to Zakharovs research institute, and split from his faction. Her faction is characterized as cybernetic devotees of pure logic, absolutely meritocratic, and lacking art or human sentiment . Jon Zeigler 2002. p.25-27. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Captain Ulrik Svensgaard , of The Nautilus Pirates, an American fisherman and naval officer. GURPS names him lead Astrogator aboard the Unity. Joined unity seeking adventure. Has pirates code of honour. Chivalric. Supremely self-confident, but not overly arrogant. Polite to associates. Faction builds offshore bases. Dogmaless. Often rootless, but emphasize community space. Political system barely above anarchy , but value personal property . Captain Svensgaard and his most trusted associates form a semi-formal police force. Narrative literature. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.42-43. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Foreman Domai , of The Free Drones, an Australian labor leader. GURPS characterizes as Domais background as geologist and mining engineer. Used on Planet as a drone , he nonetheless maintained a clarity of thought. His faction initially split from the Hive to be joined by others, and are devoted to freedom and power equality, essentially a revival of old-earth socialism. Democratic. Resource use is collective, and the drones orderly, but emphasize strong individuals. Highly motivated and productive. Mistrust intellectual elitism. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.30-32. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Datajack Sinder Roze , of The Data Angels, a Trinidadian hacker. GURPS characterizes her faction as emerging from the early network underground but splitting more prominently from the Morganites and University. They believe simply in individual freedom, but despise exploitation, power seizures and secrecy. Information brokers. Democratic and informal . Status obtained through strong gift economy ; particularly fond of luxuries, including good food, intoxicants, and elaborate roleplaying games. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.28-30. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Prophet Cha Dawn of The Cult of Planet;, a human born on Planet. GURPS characterizes faction as emerging from borderline insane environmentalists, claiming to find Cha as an infant in the fungus amid mind-worms, breathing Planets air without a filter. The hailed him as a prophet, a genetic construct created by Planet to speak on its behalf. Faction plans the eradication of human civilization. Throw themselves at the mercy of Planet. Worship the fungus planetmind as a god. Live among mind-worms, which they use as a military force. Remaining industry devoted to military. Theocratic dictatorship. Given the planet fungus apparent borderline sentience even to non-telepaths, most cultists are dedicated to their religion. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.44-45. GURPS Alpha Centauri   Guardian Lular Hminee , of The Manifold Caretakers, a Progenitor leader. The majority faction of their alien civilization, GURPS characterizes them as extremely conservative, forbidding exploitation of the scattered Manifold experiments set up by their ancestors , and in particular aim to prevent a flowering of the semi-sentient Planet-fungus, believing it would have disastrous consequences for life throughout the galaxy. Hminee was trained as a Counselor specializing in the intricacies of Caretaker philosophy , but also studied various other professions, mastering genetics, medicine, and military strategy, entering the Caretaker military. Appears to be sane and rational, and capable of innovation in spite of reactionary philosophy. At war with the Usurpers. Willing to negotiate with humans, but doesnt regard them as quite sentient, lacking several-million-year-old Caretaker rituals. Superb defense. Jon Zeigler 2002. p.51-52.

Their core value is questioning , which has largely been bred out of the species. Highly aggressive, led by the military, and largely uninterested in cooperating with humans, they breed quickly for war, utilizing genetic and psychological programming. Judaa Maar is characterized as a dogmatic atheist , and insists on his title of Conqueror , with a background as scout from a usurper government that attempted to attain godhood through a failed planetary flowering on another planet.

As they proceeded into the future, they tried to present a coherent, logical, and detailed picture of future developments in physics, biology, information technology, economics, society, government, and philosophy. Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into Alpha Centauri as external natural forces intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences.

Alpha Centauris turn-based gameplay, including the technology trees and factional warfare, was commonly compared to Civilization and Civilization II.  The Adrenaline Vaults Pete Hines said, While Alpha Centauri is the evolutionary off-spring to Civilization and Civilization II, it is not Civilization II in space. Although the comparison is inevitable because of the lineage, it is still short-sighted. Edge in 2006 praised Alpha Centauris greater sophistications as a strategy game. IGN said Alpha Centauri is a better game than Civilization II; its deep, rich, rewarding, thought-provoking in almost every way. Game Revolutions reviewer was less magnanimous, saying Alpha Centauri is at least as good a game as Civilization 2. But it is its great similarity that also does it the most detriment. Alpha Centauri simply does not do enough that is new; it just doesnt innovate enough to earn a higher grade. The ability to create custom units was praised, as was the depth of the tech tree. The artificial intelligence of computer-controlled factions, which featured adaptability and behavioral subtlety,  was given mixed comments; some reviewers thought it was efficient and logical, while others found it confusing or erratic. Edge was disappointed in the games diplomacy, finding no more and no less than is expected from the genre and unhappy with the inability to sound out any real sense of relationship or rational discourse.          The games graphics were widely acknowledged to be above average at the time of its release, but not revolutionary. Its maps and interface were   considered detailed and in accordance with a space theme, but the game was released with a limited color palette. The in-game cutscenes, particularly the ": null

Alpha Centauris sound and music received similar comments; FiringSquad said sort of follows the same line as the unit graphics â€“ not too splashy but enough to get the job done.      Next Generation  reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that Sid Meier creates yet another masterpiece in this game that, at a glance, looks all too familiar.
