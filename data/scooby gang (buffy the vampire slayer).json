In the beginning, Buffy often had to protect her friends from monsters, but over the course of the series most of them gained superpowers and fighting skills of their own, with Xander the only notable member with no mystical abilities or connection to the supernatural, though he does acquire extensive military knowledge thanks to a spell. Due to the shows strong themes of female empowerment, the most powerful members of the team are often female , while the men play passive roles such as that of father-figure and supportive best friend . Also, in keeping with the shows themes of redemption and moral ambiguity, Willow, Angel, Spike, Faith, Giles, Anya, and Andrew have at some point in their lives descended into darkness. Each of these characters has murdered at least one person during their life, although for most it was substantially more.     At least initially, in  Season Eight  , the Scoobies are scattered across the world. In addition to the primary gang, there are short of 42 Slayers, many of whom work with the expanded organization in addition to witches, psychics and other staff.

Although Buffy had initially been reluctant to accept her destiny, by the end of Season One she faces the prophecy of her death head-on, later revived by Xander.

Even after the Watchers Council stripped him of his title in Season Three, he continued to support Buffy. He remained with the Scoobies until the end of Season Five, when he returned to England at Buffys death. In Season Six he returns after Buffy is resurrected, then leaves again so that his presence wont hold her back from growing strong and independent. Thereafter, he is based in England where he is training a squad of Slayers, and Andrew as a Watcher. Giles was almost killed by the evil Angelus toward the end of Season Two. In Season Eight, a possessed Angel snapped Giles neck, killing him instantly.    Xander Harris  — The most consistent and reliable member of the Scoobies, the wise-cracking Xander is notable for being one of the few characters in the show with no superpowers . Instead, his insight, compassion, and support is how he helps his friends in the battle against evil; for example, he brings Willow back from the brink of darkness with his unconditional love in Season Six.

Angel  — Angel is unique among vampires because he is cursed with a soul, Spike being the only other known vampire with a soul. He is also Buffys lover in Seasons One through Three. Angels ability to work with the other Scoobies on the side of good is completely dependent on his soul. Without his soul, Angel becomes Angelus, a vampire with no humanity whatsoever. In Season Two, his soul was briefly stripped from him after a forbidden moment of utter happiness. During this time he killed Jenny Calendar and tortured Giles causing his relationship with the group to remain strained even after his soul was restored. Angel leaves the Scoobies at Buffys graduation. Together with Cordelia, he starts his own group, Angel Investigations, in Los Angeles. Though he returned to Buffy in Season Eight, Angel was possessed and killed Giles. This caused a rift between Angel and Buffy, and Angel decided to search for a way to resurrect Giles with the help of Faith.    Jenny Calendar  — The computer science teacher at Sunnydale High, who holds a secret allegiance to her gypsy clan. Her real name is Janna of the Kalderash tribe, and her secret motivation for being at Sunnydale is to make sure the curse her clan cast on Angel remains intact.

After Angel is re-ensouled, she returns with Willow to Sunnydale to help the Scoobies in their final battle against the First Evil. In  Season Eight , she and Giles decided to partner together in a Slayer social worker program to keep Slayers from going to the dark side. After the Watchers death, Faith accompanied Angel to both aid him in his quest to resurrect Giles and to make sure that he does not become evil again.    Anya Jenkins  — Born mortal a thousand years ago as Aud, Anya became the vengeance demon Anyanka after turning her cheating boyfriend into a troll. She specialized in cursing men who had wronged women. When one of her curses went in an unanticipated direction, the breaking of a curse stripped her of her powers and made her mortal again. During her struggles with her unwanted mortality, Anya falls in love with Xander, who helps her to understand human conventions. Anya often offends people due to her frank honesty and literalness.

Like Willow, she is also a witch. On her own, she is nowhere near as powerful as Willow, but together they make a formidable magical team. Before meeting Willow, Tara had been painfully shy, in part due to a father who led her to believe that she was demonic.

Part of the deal was that he and Drusilla leave Sunnydale. However, he returns several times after Drusilla leaves him. When Spike tries to return for good in Season Four, the Initiative promptly captures him and fits him with a tracking device and a microchip that prevents him from harming humans. As a result, he allies again with the Scoobies. Over time, Spike falls in love with Buffy, and he briefly becomes Buffys lover in Season Six. Her rejection of him, which leads to him almost raping her, inspires him to recover his soul. When a newly ensouled Spike comes back to Sunnydale in Season Seven, Buffy and Spike have a relationship that is more emotional than physical and over the course of the season, Buffy falls in love with him and tells him in the series finale. Most of the Scoobies also remain somewhat wary of him right up until the last episode, when he fights side by side with them and, with help from an amulet given by Angel, sacrifices himself to save the world.
