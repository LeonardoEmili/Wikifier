By 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then. Exhaustive searches have been carried out to find all pairs less than a given bound, this bound being extended from 10 8 in 1970, to 10 10 in 1986, 10 11 in 1993, 10 17 in 2015, and to 10 18 in 2016.     , there are over 1,223,633,201 known amicable pairs.
