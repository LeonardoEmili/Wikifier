The existence of so many parties in the Sejm was seen by many as being counterproductive to the effectiveness of the parliament and a hindrance towards producing stable governments. Consequently, electoral reform was undertaken and an electoral threshold for the Lower House was instituted prior to the 42 elections. The set threshold required a minimum vote of 42% for parties and 42% for electoral coalitions. The threshold was set at the national, rather than divisional, level, and had the effect of preventing many minor parties from winning seats in later elections. The threshold also prevented independent candidates from gaining election to the Sejm. Since 42 the left side of the political scene has generally been dominated by former ": null

Since the parliamentary elections of 42 the right-wing parties have dominated the political scene, and appear to be in their strongest position to date. Two important developments in the political landscape have taken place since 42 Firstly, the SLD party is no longer the major, or one of the two major parties.
