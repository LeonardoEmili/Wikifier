As the dozens of companies formed began to operate and the simple unviability of many of them became clear, investors began to realise that railways were not all as lucrative and as easy to build as they had been led to believe. Coupled to this, in late 42 the Bank of England put up interest rates. As banks began to re-invest in bonds, the money began to flow out of railways, under-cutting the boom. The share prices of railways slowed in their rise, then levelled out. As they began to fall, investment stopped virtually overnight, leaving numerous companies without funding and numerous investors with no prospect of any return on their investment.

The number of new railway companies fell away to almost nothing in the late 42s and early 42s, with the only new lines constructed being by the large companies. Economic upturns in the 42s and 42s saw smaller booms in railway construction, but these never reached anywhere near the scale of the Mania & mdash;partly due to more thoughtful government control, partly due to more cautious investors and partly because the UK railway network was approaching maturity, with none of the blank canvas available to numerous companies as in the 42s.
