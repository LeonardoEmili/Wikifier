Despite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special. By April 42 Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency. Mendelson imagined he would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allens proposal: an animated half-hour Peanuts Christmas special. The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special for advertising during the holiday season. The bad news is that today is Wednesday and theyll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday, Allen remarked to Mendelson. He quickly contacted Schulz, and the duo got to work with plans for a Peanuts Christmas special. The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose ideas flowed nonstop.  According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music.  The outline did not change over the course of its production.     As Allen was in Europe, the duo received no feedback on their pitch for several days. When Allen got in touch with them, he informed them that Coca-Cola wanted to buy the special, but also wanted it for an early December broadcast, giving the duo just six months to scramble together a team to produce the special. Mendelson assured him â€“ without complete confidence in his statements â€“ that this would be no problem. Following this, A Charlie Brown Christmas entered production.

Schulz was adamant about Linus reading of the Bible, despite Mendelson and Melendezs concerns that religion was a controversial topic, especially on television. Melendez recalled Schulz turned to him and remarked If we dont do it, who will? . Schulzs estimation proved accurate, and in the 42s, less than 42 percent of television Christmas episodes contained a substantive reference to religion, according to university researcher Stephen Lind. Lind, Stephen J. Christmas in the 42s: A Charlie Brown Christmas, Religion, and the Conventions of the Genre Journal of Religion and Popular Culture 42 It could also be worth noting that Linuss recitation of Scripture was incorporated in such a way that it forms the climax of the film, thus making it impossible to successfully edit out.     Schulzs faith in the Bible stemmed from his Midwest background and religious and historical studies; as such, aspects of religion would be a topic of study throughout his life. Templeton, David. , reproduced from the December 42 42 â€“ January 42 42 issue of the Sonoma County Independent.  November 42 42 According to a 42 spiritual biography , Schulzs religion was personal and complex, and would be integrated in a number of his programs. Lind, Stephen J.

In the days following the specials sell to Coca-Cola, Mendelson and animator Bill Melendez met with Schulz in his home to expand upon the ideas promised in the pitch.

Mendelson suggested they employ a laugh track, a staple of television animation, but Schulz rejected this idea immediately. He felt strongly that the audience should not be informed on when to laugh. They spoke at length about creating an official theme that was neither jazz nor traditional to open the program. Schulz wanted a part of the special to feature the character of Schroeder performing Beethoven, and Mendelson combined this with the inclusion of Guaraldis Linus & Lucy number. Schulz penned the script for A Charlie Brown Christmas, with Melendez plotting out the animation via a storyboard. His storyboard contained six panels for each shot, spanning a combined eighty or-so pages.       In casting the silent comic strip characters of Peanuts, the trio pulled from their personalities. Lead character Charlie Browns voice was decided to be downbeat and nondescript , while Lucy be bold and forthright. Linus voice, it was decided, would combine both sophistication with childlike innocence. Mendelson recognized that the character of Snoopy was the strips most popular character who seemed to seize the best jokes, but realized they could not cast a voice for the cartoon dog.

There are no adult characters in the strip or in this special. Later specials would introduce an offscreen teacher; her lines are eschewed for the sound of a trombone as the team behind the specials found it humorous.     With this in mind, the trio set out to cast the characters, which proved to be a daunting process. Casting for Charlie Brown proved most difficult, as it required both good acting skills but also the ability to appear nonchalant. The producers picked eight-year-old ": null

His godmother, famous Hollywood agent Hazel McMillen, discovered Christopher Shea, who would become Linus in the special. His slight lisp, according to Mendelson, gave him a youthful sweetness, while his emotional script reading gave him power and authority as well.  Tracy Stratford played the role of Lucy, with the creators being impressed by her attitude and professionalism. Kathy Steinberg was the youngest of the performers, just six years old at the time of recording. Too young to read, the producers had to give her one line at a time to recite. Robbins remembered Melendez did this for him as well, joking that he also mistakenly copied his Latino accent. Mendelson desired to have non-actors perform on the special, and he sent tape recorders home with his employees for their children to audition.     Much of the background cast came from Mendelsons home neighborhood in northern California. According to Robbins, the children viewed the scripts sophisticated dialogue as edgy, finding several words and phrases, among them eastern syndicate , difficult to pronounce. He recalled the recording sessions as chaotic, with excited children running rampant. Nevertheless, the recording of A Charlie Brown Christmas was completed in one day. ": null

Animation for A Charlie Brown Christmas was created by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had no idea whether or not completing a half-hours worth of animation would be possible given the productions six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility. In actuality, animation was only completed in the final four months of production.

The recording sessions were conducted in late autumn 42 and were cut in three separate sessions over two weeks. They often ran late into the night, resulting in angry parents, some who forbade their children from returning; consequently, numerous new children were present at each session. The children were directed by Barry Mineah, who demanded perfection from the choir. Mendelson and Guaraldi disagreed, desiring the kids to sound like kids ; they used a slightly off-key version of Hark! The Herald Angels Sing in the final cut. Children were paid five dollars for their participation. In addition, the children recorded dialogue for the specials final scene, in which the crowd of kids shout Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!      The soundtrack for the special was recorded during these sessions, with decisions regarding timing and phrasing determined quickly. Guaraldi brought in bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli to record the music, and spent time later re-recording earlier tracks, including covers of The Christmas Song and Greensleeves. The eventual LP release credited Guaraldi solely, neglecting to mention the other musicians; Guaraldi was notorious for never keeping records of his session players. Nearly three decades later, in an effort to correct the matter, Fantasy surmised that the recordings with Budwig and Bailey were employed in the special, while Marshall and Granelli recorded the album. Despite this, other individuals have come forward claiming to have recorded the specials music: bassists Eugene Firth and Al Obidinski, and drummers Paul Distel and Benny Barth.

Melendez was embarrassed, but one of the animators, Ed Levitt, was more positive regarding the special, telling him it was the best special ever make This show is going to run for a hundred years.  Mendelson was similar in his assumptions of the shows quality, and when he showed the film to network executives in New York, their opinions were also negative. Their complaints included the shows slow pace, the music not fitting, and the animation too simple.
