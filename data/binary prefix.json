The International System of Units does not define units for digital information but notes that the SI prefixes may be applied outside the contexts where base units or derived units would be used. But as computer main memory in a   binary-addressed system is manufactured in sizes that were easily expressed as multiples of 1024, kilobyte, when applied to computer memory, came to be used to mean 1024 bytes instead of 1000. This usage is not consistent with the SI. Compliance with the SI requires that the prefixes take their 1000-based meaning, and that they are not to be used as placeholders for other numbers, like 1024.      The use of K in the binary sense as in a 32K core meaning  words, i.e.,  words, can be found as early as 1959.  Note: the IBM 704 core memory units had 4096 36-bit words. Up to  words could be installed  The 8K core stores were getting fairly common in this country in 1954.

By the mid-1970s it was common to see K meaning 1024 and the occasional M meaning  for words or bytes of main memory while K and M were commonly used with their decimal meaning for disk storage. In the 1980s, as capacities of both types of devices increased, the SI prefix G, with SI meaning, was commonly applied to disk storage, while M in its binary meaning, became common for computer memory. In the 1990s, the prefix G, in its binary meaning, became commonly used for computer memory capacity. The first terabyte  hard disk drive was introduced in 2007.      The dual usage of the kilo , mega , and giga prefixes as both powers of 1000 and powers of 1024 has been recorded in standards and dictionaries. For example, the 1986 ANSI/IEEE Std 1084-1986    defined dual uses for kilo and mega.    The binary units Kbyte and Mbyte were formally defined in ANSI/IEEE Std 1212-1991.      Many dictionaries have noted the practice of using traditional prefixes to indicate binary multiples.     Oxford online dictionary defines, for example, megabyte as: Computing: a unit of information equal to one million or  bytes.      The units Kbyte, Mbyte, and Gbyte are found in the trade press and in IEEE journals.
