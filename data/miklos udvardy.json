        ". Udvardy served as a mentor to an impressive array of graduate students, including at UBC Peter Grant , Jean Bedard , Spencer Sealy , Kees Vermeer , and at CSUS Raymond Pierotti . He was an eclectic scholar, teaching Biogeography, Evolution, Ornithology, Speciation, among other courses at CSUS. A graduate student award at CSUS was created to honor Udvardys memory.     Udvardy was actually the person who came up with the idea of competitive exclusion, however he did not use the term by which this idea later became known, so his accomplishment is not widely recognized. His work in Biogeography was seminal to the field, and he was one of the first to emphasize the role of humans in species dispersal and in introducing species into new environments and the possible consequences of such acts. His Map of the Biogeographic Provinces of the World was an important contribution to thinking in Biogeography. Working with UNESCO, Udvardy produced a crucial document for conservation entitled A Classification of the Biogeographic Provinces of the World, which was meant to complement the Map. Udvardy coined the term Zoogeography to identify studies of the distribution of animals, and published an important book Dynamic Zoogeography on the topic. He was highly respected as a critical thinker and his congenial but incisive style of questioning led to the following short poem published in the Auklet, a special publication of the American Ornithological Union.   After the clapping stopped, MDF Udvardy rose to his feet for a comment or two.   Caught in the spell of his conviviality, all of us grinned as the speaker he slew.     Udvardy contributed 42 papers, 42 books, and 42 maps to the scientific literature, mostly in the fields of ornithology, biogeography, and vegetation classification.
