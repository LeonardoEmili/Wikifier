Commenting on the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi, Rajiv Gandhi said, When a giant tree falls, the earth below shakes ;  a statement for which he was widely criticised. Many Congress politicians were accused of orchestrating the violence.           Soon after assuming office, Gandhi asked President Singh to dissolve Parliament and hold fresh elections, as the Lok Sabha had completed its five-year term. Gandhi officially became the President of the Congress party, which won a landslide victory with the largest majority in history of the Indian Parliament, giving Gandhi absolute control of government. He benefited from his youth and a general perception of being free of a background in corrupt politics.  Gandhi took his oath on 31 December 1984; at 40, he was the youngest Prime Minister of India. Historian Meena Agarwal writes that even after taking the Prime Ministerial oath, he was a relatively unknown figure, novice in politics as he assumed the post after being an MP for three years.
