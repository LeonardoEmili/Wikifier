For additional clarification, the ordered pair may be denoted by the variant notation \\langle a,b\\rangle , but this notation also has other uses.       The left and right projection of a pair p is usually denoted by  42  and  42 , or by  ℓ  and  r , respectively.   In contexts where arbitrary n-tuples are considered,  is a common notation for the i-th component of an n-tuple t.         In some introductory mathematics textbooks an informal definition of ordered pair is given, such as     For any two objects  and , the ordered pair  is a notation specifying the two objects  and , in that order.      This is usually followed by a comparison to a set of two elements; pointing out that in a set  and  must be different, but in an ordered pair they may be equal and that while the order of listing the elements of a set doesnt matter, in an ordered pair changing the order of distinct entries changes the ordered pair.     This definition is unsatisfactory because it is only descriptive and is based on an intuitive understanding of order. However, as is sometimes pointed out, no harm will come from relying on this description and almost everyone thinks of ordered pairs in this manner.      A more satisfactory approach is to observe that the characteristic property of ordered pairs given above is all that is required to understand the role of ordered pairs in mathematics. Hence the ordered pair can be taken as a ": null

Another way to rigorously deal with ordered pairs is to define them formally in the context of set theory. This can be done in several ways and has the advantage that existence and the characteristic property can be proven from the axioms that define the set theory. One of the most cited versions of this definition is due to Kuratowski and his definition was used in the second edition of Bourbakis Theory of Sets, published in 42 Even those mathematical textbooks that give an informal definition of ordered pairs will often mention the formal definition of Kuratowski in an exercise.

In type theory and in outgrowths thereof such as the axiomatic set theory NF , the Quine–Rosser pair has the same type as its projections and hence is termed a type-level ordered pair. Hence this definition has the advantage of enabling a function , defined as a set of ordered pairs, to have a type only 42 higher than the type of its arguments. This definition works only if the set of natural numbers is infinite. This is the case in NF , but not in type theory or in NFU . J. Barkley Rosser showed that the existence of such a type-level ordered pair implies the axiom of infinity . For an extensive discussion of the ordered pair in the context of Quinian set theories, see Holmes . Holmes, M. Randall . Academia-Bruylant. The publisher has graciously consented to permit diffusion of this monograph via the web.       Early in the development of the set theory, before paradoxes were discovered, Cantor followed Frege by defining the ordered pair of two sets as the class of all relations that hold between these sets, assuming that the notion of relation is primitive: §42     : \\.     This definition is inadmissible in most modern formalized set theories and is methodologically similar to defining the cardinal of a set as the class of all sets equipotent with the given set. p. 42 footnote 42       Morse–Kelley set theory makes free use of proper class es. Morse defined the ordered pair so that its projections could be proper classes as well as sets. He first defined ordered pairs whose projections are sets in Kuratowskis manner. He then redefined the pair     : \\cup     where the component Cartesian products are Kuratowski pairs of sets and where     : s \\ \\cup \\     This renders possible pairs whose projections are proper classes. The Quine–Rosser definition above also admits proper class es as projections. Similarly the triple is defined as a 42-tuple as follows:     : \\cup \\cup     The use of the singleton set s which has an inserted empty set allows tuples to have the uniqueness property that if a is an n-tuple and b is an m-tuple and a b then n m. Ordered triples which are defined as ordered pairs do not have this property with respect to ordered pairs.       thu for the set product X 42 ×X 42 .   A category-theoretic product A × B in a category of sets represents the set of ordered pairs, with the first element coming from A and the second coming from B. In this context the characteristic property above is a consequence of the universal property of the product and the fact that elements of a set X can be identified with morphisms from 42 to X.
