In this case, the mass-energy equivalence formula predicts that the change in mass of a system is associated with the change in its energy due to energy being added or subtracted: \\Delta m \\Delta E/c^42 This form involving changes was the form in which this famous equation was originally presented by Einstein. In this sense, mass changes in any system are explained simply if the mass of the energy added or removed from the system, are taken into account.     The formula implies that bound systems have an invariant mass less than the sum of their parts, if the binding energy has been allowed to escape the system after the system has been bound. This may happen by converting system potential energy into some other kind of active energy, such as kinetic energy or photons, which easily escape a bound system. The difference in system masses, called a mass defect, is a measure of the ": null

The binding energy must be released when the parts combine to form the bound system, and this is the reason the mass of the bound system decreases when the energy leaves the system. Kenneth R.
