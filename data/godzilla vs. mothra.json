Ed Godziszewski, , Monster Zero  Japan Hero said, While this movie is not the best of the Heisei series, it is still a really interesting movie. The battles are cool, and Battra was an interesting idea. If you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend it.       Stomp Tokyo said the film is one of the better Godzilla movies in that the scenes in which monsters do not appear actually make some sort of sense. And for once, they are acted with some gusto, so that we as viewers can actually come to like the characters on screen, or at least be entertained by them.  Mike Bogue of American Kaiju said the film not live up to its potential, but added that colorful and elaborate spectacle eventually won over and the main story thread dealing with the eventual reconciliation of the divorced couple adequately holds the human plot together.
