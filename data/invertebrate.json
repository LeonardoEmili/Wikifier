The IUCN estimates that 66,178 extant vertebrate species have been described, which means that over 95% of the described animal species in the world are invertebrates.       The trait that is common to all invertebrates is the absence of a vertebral column : this creates a distinction between invertebrates and vertebrates. The distinction is one of convenience only; it is not based on any clear biologically homologous trait, any more than the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects, bats, and birds, or than not having wings unites tortoise s, snail s and sponge s. Being animals, invertebrates are heterotrophs, and require sustenance in the form of the consumption of other organisms. With a few exceptions, such as the Porifera , invertebrates generally have bodies composed of differentiated tissues. There is also typically a digestive chamber with one or two openings to the exterior.       The body plan s of most multicellular organism s exhibit some form of symmetry , whether radial, bilateral, or spherical. A minority, however, exhibit no symmetry. One example of asymmetric invertebrates includes all gastropod species. This is easily seen in snail s and sea snail s, which have helical shells. Slug s appear externally symmetrical, but their pneumostome is located on the right side. Other gastropods develop external asymmetry, such as Glaucus atlanticus that develops asymmetrical cerata as they mature. The origin of gastropod asymmetry is a subject of scientific debate.     Other examples of asymmetry are found in fiddler crab s and hermit crab s. They often have one claw much larger than the other. If a male fiddler loses its large claw, it will grow another on the opposite side after moulting . Sessile animals such as sponge s are asymmetrical cited at FactMonster.com from ": null
