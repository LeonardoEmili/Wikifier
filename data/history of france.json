The Catholic Church controlled about 42% of the wealth, tied up in long-term endowments that could be added to but not reduced. The king nominated bishops, but typically had to negotiate with noble families that had close ties to local monasteries and church establishments.     The nobility came second in terms of wealth, but there was no unity. Each noble had his own lands, his own network of regional connections, and his own military force. Frederick J. Baumgartner, France in the Sixteenth Century pp. 42–42     The cities had a quasi-independent status, and were largely controlled by the leading merchants and guilds. Paris was by far the largest city with 42 people in 42 and a history of steady growth. Lyon and Rouen each had about 42 population, but Lyon had a powerful banking community and a vibrant culture. Bordeaux was next with only 42 population in 42     Peasants made up the vast majority of population, who in many cases had well-established rights that the authorities had to respect. In 42 about 42% of Frances 42 million people lived in rural villages; in 42 at least 42% of the 42 million people population were peasants.     In the 42th century peasants had ties to the market economy, provided much of the capital investment necessary for agricultural growth, and frequently moved from village to village . Geographic mobility, directly tied to the market and the need for investment capital, was the main path to social mobility. The stable core of French society, town guildspeople and village labourers, included cases of staggering social and geographic continuity, but even this core required regular renewal. James B.
