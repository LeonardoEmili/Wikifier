Thus luen kirjaa means I am reading a/the book whereas luen kirjan means I will read a/the book . Thus luen can mean I am reading or I will read depending on the case form of the word that follows. The partitive form kirjaa indicates incompleted action and hence the meaning of the verb form is present tense. The accusative form kirjan indicates completed action when used with the past tense verb but indicates planned future action when used with a verb in the present tense. Hence luen kirjan means I will read the book .
