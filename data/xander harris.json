In The Watcher , the seasons villains, mystical Siphon Severin and rogue Slayer Simone persuade Xander to assist them in their plot to turn back time and avert Twilight. In the final arc, The Core, Xander supplies them with information from an ancient tome on vampires Buffy owns. Acting on the same information, Buffy and Willow decide that the Deeper Well in England & mdash;a prison for ancient demons & mdash;may contain enough magic to save Dawn, and Xander travels with them. While entering the Well, Xander confesses his betrayal to Buffy and informs her of Severins plan to use the magic in the Well to turn back time, which could destroy the universe. He stands beside Buffy when they discover Simones ulterior motive for entering the Well; she has allowed herself to be sired by the very demon which created the first vampire, transforming herself into a powerful vampire/Slayer hybrid.

Xander, wracked with guilt, is convinced something is odd about her, and has begun talking to possibly hallucinated visions of his ex-girlfriend Anya. He does not know, as Dawn later confesses to Buffy, that she is experiencing intense emotional anguish from reliving her entire life at the moment Willow brought her back. When Dracula rolls in to town to help the Slayer combat the threat of new, more powerful vampires with powers like his, Xander slips back into the manservant role and confesses to Dawn that he knows she does not really love him, which Dawn tearfully admits is true.

After the level at Sunnydale High, he has to do battle with an alternate universe Anyanka, the levels boss ; a magical tophat that releases rabbits evens their playing field slightly. Following the level at the zoo featured in The Pack , Buffy battles against an evil alternate reality version of Giles, styled Ripper . Chaos Bleeds prompted prequel comic books published by Dark Horse and a novelisation, which treats it as a lost episode of season five.         Nicholas Brendons twin brother Kelly Donovan would often stunt double for Xander in the series, most notably in the episode The Replacement , where dual Xanders appear on-screen at the same time. They both use stage names; their surname is Shultz; as children, they were inseparable.   Before landing the role of Xander, Brendon had hit rock bottom : his girlfriend had left him, he was working as a waiter and could barely afford his rent, and had almost given up on getting good work. After buying the wrong kind of Pop Tarts for his co-workers, his boss fired him and told him You should be acting. Brendon was attracted to the pilot script for Buffy because of how much he had hated high school. Brendon recognised that Xander was based on Joss Whedon when he had attended high school, accounting for why Xander gets all the good lines . Brendon did not get much acting work after Buffy finished, and went into an alcoholism rehabilitation centre in 42 Whedon.info.

Though Xander is often the heart of the Scooby Gang, in The Zeppo he is excluded from their battle against a hydra-like demon. Through the use of jump cut s between melodramatic scenes with Buffy, and for instance, informant Willy the Barkeeper to Xander and a gang of zombies in a drunken car journey, Xander is used as a vehicle to point out the ways in which Buffy ordinarily avoids being over the top by integrating Xander into the main narrative rather than separating the two. His loss of his virginity to Faith, for example, is musically cued as an anti-romantic parallel to the swelling, symphonic romance scene that Xander oversees between Buffy and Angel; on his departure from the carnal bed, the music is re-cued. The episode depicts Xander single-handedly saving the school, and potentially the world from an explosion in simultaneity against glimpses of the other Scoobies struggles with the hydra demon. As the episode draws to a climax, the two settings begin to erode into one, as the demon breaks through walls in the basement and enters into the episodes Xander scenes. Stevenson notes that it is fitting for the character to have his most heroic moment in the school basement, given that in season four he will be reduced to living in his parents; Xanders fears in Restless explore his feeling of being trapped in that basement. Wilcox argues that the basement is a representation of the subconscious, and that young carefree zombie Jack OToole represents Xanders id , his inner desires. The episode brings to light how the basis for heroism rests in the subconscious, and also how as the two battles increasingly merge, his friends cannot hope to save the world and save others unless Xanders battle with the Self is also won. In his confrontation with Jack, just as in his confrontation with Dark Willow in season sixs Grave , Xander saves the world through his words. As the warrior of words , Wilcox feels that this makes Xander the character who most clearly represents series creator Joss Whedon.     Throughout the series, Xanders family are seen to be highly dysfunctional and composed of alcoholics. Xander relates in Amends that he sleeps outside at Christmas to avoid the family quarrels. This leads him to seek a surrogate family in his friendships with Buffy, Willow and Giles. Xander lacks Giless and Willows academic intelligence, and Buffys physical prowess. Cordelia is initially ashamed to be Xanders girlfriend. Throughout the series, Xander struggles to contribute meaningfully to the group dynamic. His dissatisfaction reaches a nadir in season four: Xanders physical dislocation from his college friends leads to a profound sense of being useless.

        " with Willow, Buffy and Giles, who comments, Oh, Im beginning to understand this now. Its all about the journey, isnt it. Xanders dream, in turn, is one of intense self-exploration. In his dream, Xander goes to use the bathroom, and is emasculated and infantilized by Buffy asking him if he needs any help: this scene shows Xanders sense of insecurity and powerlessness . Nevertheless, he becomes lost and finds himself in his parents basement. From there, he finds himself in his ice cream truck, where Anya asks if he knows what he is doing, underlining the aimlessness of his journey; he is in the basement once again. When suddenly he is in the army and Principal Snyder  asks where he comes from, he says, The basement, mostly. He fears that his military interrogator is correct in saying that he is the whipping boy and set on a sacrificial stone .     Although The Replacement sets up its narrative as an evil twin television narrative trope , its catch is that both Xanders are in fact the real Xander. In this episode, Xander uncovers that he has the power within himself to be the adult, suave and confident man whom he had spent the episode envying. The dual Xanders , Stephens argues, represents the duality in all of us. The episode demonstrates that Xander is not defined by his weaker personality traits but by the core personality that is a merger of his stronger and weaker traits. Xanders costume choices in various Halloween episodes show the audience his desire for macho credence: he comes, variously, as a cowboy, a soldier and as James Bond. As a soldier, he was in fact magically turned into his costume, and got to retain his macho status along with the useful military knowledge. Following this incident, his choice of costume represents explicitly whom he would like to actually become. Various episodes highlight Xanders intense bravery; for example, he faces down evil Angelus at Buffys hospital door in the episode Killed by Death , and he offers his life in place of Willows in Inca Mummy Girl . When Buffy prepares to face Angelus in the season two finale , he arrives with a rock in hand saying Cavalrys here. Cavalrys a frightened guy with a rock, but its here. Stephens argues that this makes up the essence of Xanders character; though powerless, he is always both loyal and brave. As his relationship with Dawn in Potential and his support of Buffy show, Xander finds that his real calling seems to be in his role as the eternal supporter . One journalist describes the character as a modern-day Greek Chorus , always an outsider looking in, and a version of Joss Whedon himself. One author writes that the focus of Xanders character development has always been his quest for maturity.     While their characters were an item, Brendon was close friends with Charisma Carpenter, who portrays Cordelia. When they broke up on the show, and Cordelia transitioned to the spin-off Angel, he commented that they had hardly spoken due to being in different scenes all the time. This felt like a real-life breakup in many ways. When Xander got to become serious with Anya in season five, the actor commented that it was nice to see Xander mature after four years of playing the nerd . Lorna Jowett feels that Xanders romances throughout the season almost seem to make up for the characters shortcomings, which Stafford attributes to Xanders origin as Whedons author surrogate in the show. Anya comments that Xander is a Viking in the sack in The Yoko Factor , indicating not just masculinity but also virility. Within the show, gay character Larry mistakes Xander for being gay, and Xanders unguarded comments towards Spike have led some fans who write fan fiction to depict Xander as being gay. Jowett attributes this to Xanders internal struggles do not contain a readily accessible solution for viewers to hold onto. She argues that some fans see this as a stumbling block , perhaps unconsciously, to recognising the characters masculinity and at a wider level, in constructing a notion of contemporary masculinity.     In the DVD commentary for the episode Dirty Girls , writer Drew Goddard mentions there was talk of killing off Xander towards the end of Season Seven and having the First Evil assume Xanders appearance when conversing with Buffy for the remainder of the season. This was ultimately rejected since Xander was thought to be too important to the series, and his death occurring so late in the season would leave little time to deal with it correctly, and that throughout the series run, Xander was the one character who never wavered, and to punish that characteristic with death would send a message the staff wasnt trying to convey. Instead of killing Xander, he was blinded in one eye.       For his role as Xander, Brendon was nominated for Saturn Award in 42 and 42 for Best Genre TV Actor and in 42 for the Supporting Actor. Later critiques of Xanders character regarded him less sympathetically, regarding him as a Nice Guy™ .       The Zeppo in season three was a Xander-centric episode, which only featured the other characters in humorous aside glimpses of their struggle to save the world. This episode has proved very influential on later television writers. In his Production Notes: Doodles in the Margins of Time in 42 ": null
