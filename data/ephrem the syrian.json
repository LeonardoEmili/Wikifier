Particularly influential were his Hymns Against Heresies. Mourachian, Mark. Hymns Against Heresies: Comments on St. Ephrem the Syrian . Sophia 37:2, , pp. 30-31.

He lamented that the faithful were tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles.

However, most of these liturgical hymns are edited and conflated versions of the originals.     The most complete, critical text of authentic Ephrem was compiled between 1955 and 1979 by Dom Edmund Beck, OSB, as part of the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium.     As Chronologist, St. Ephrem the Syrian has composed the history of the Patriarchs and Kings from the Creation to the Crucifixion of Christ, https://web.archive.org/web/20160810191441/http://www.filbluz.ca/resources/Book-of-the-cave-of-Treasure.pdf The Book of the Cave of Treasure, translated by W. Budge from the Syriac text of the British Museum Mss Add. 25875, published by The Religious Tract Society, 1927.       Ephrems writings contain a rich variety of symbols and metaphors. Christopher Buck gives a summary of analysis of a selection of six key scenarios  and six root metaphors .        Ephrems artful meditations on the symbols of Christian faith and his stand against heresy made him a popular source of inspiration throughout the church.
