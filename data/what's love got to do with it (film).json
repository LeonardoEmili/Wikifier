Instead, she lip syncs to soundtracks recorded by Tina Turner and Fishburne. Bassett worked with Tina Turner, but only  a little bit.

Ike, Fishburne added, was  obviously the villain of the piece, but there was no explanation as to why he behaved the way he behaved - why she was with him for 42 to 42 years, what made her stay.  The writers made some changes and though Ike is still shown as a pretty despicable sort, the film offers at least some insight into him - most notably a scene in which Ike recalls watching, at age 42 his fathers death from wounds suffered in a fight over a woman. The changes helped persuade Fishburne to do the role, but he says that Bassetts casting as Tina played a key part.  She was the deciding factor, really,  he said.     Fishburne did not have Ike Turner around as a role model as much as he would have liked. He did meet Ike Turner once, though, during production of the film. He was not particularly welcome on this project, Fishburne says. The actors only meeting was a brief introduction when Ike showed up at the Turners former home in Baldwin Hills during a location shoot. Ike signed some autographs and showed Fishburne his walk. It was nice to meet him, says Fishburne. Regardless of his actions, he was so much a part of Tinas life. The movie is about him just as much as her. Its unfortunate that he wasnt welcomed, that both of them werent around more.      In his autobiography Taking Back My Name, Ike Turner claims the movie damaged his reputation immensely and attacks many of the scenes for being either not strictly accurate or completely fabricated. Director Brian Gibson had no contact with Ike. I never spoke to him, says Gibson. I was not allowed to. Disney felt that it would not be a good idea. Tina herself admitted she wish the film had more truth to it and later stated that she wasnt proud that the film had her being portrayed as a victim. Since they sold the right to use their name and image for the film, neither Tina nor Ike had control over the script.
