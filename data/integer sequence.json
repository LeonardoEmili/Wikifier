For example, the sequence 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42  …  is formed by starting with 42 and 42 and then adding any two consecutive terms to obtain the next one: an implicit description. The sequence 42 42 42 42  … is formed according to the formula n 42   & minus;  42 for the nth term: an explicit definition.     Alternatively, an integer sequence may be defined by a property which members of the sequence possess and other integers do not possess.
