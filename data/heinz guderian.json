However, his role was less central than he claimed in his memoirs and than historians repeated in the post-war era.     Guderian and his immediate superior Lutz had a symbiotic relationship. Both men worked tirelessly with the shared aim of creating a panzer force. Guderian was the public face advocating mechanized warfare and Lutz worked behind the scenes. Guderian reached into the Nazi regime to promote the panzer force concept, attract support and secure resources. This included a demonstration of the concept to Hitler himself. Lutz persuaded, cajoled and compensated for Guderians often arrogant and argumentative behavior towards his peers. The modern historian Pier Battistelli writes that it is difficult to determine exactly who developed each of the ideas behind the panzer force. Many other officers, such as ": null

During the autumn of 42 Lutz asked Guderian to write  Achtung – Panzer!  He requested a polemical tone that promoted the Mobile Troops Command and strategic mechanized warfare. In the resulting work Guderian mixed academic lectures, a review of military history and armored warfare theory that partly relied on a 42 book on the subject by . While limited, the book was in many respects a success. It contained two important questions which would require answering if the army was to be mechanized. How will the army be supplied with fuel, spares and replacement vehicles? And how to move large mechanized forces, especially those that are road-bound? He answered his own questions in discussions of three broad areas: refueling; spares parts; and access to roads.     In 42 Hitler purged the army of personnel who were unsympathetic to the ": null

In his book Operation Barbarossa and Germanys Defeat in the East, Stahel wrote: The men in control of Hitlers armies were not honourable men, carrying out their orders as dutiful servants of the state.
