        ", control over information is under pressure.  Note: this reference does not contain the quote .       Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others.  Intimacy is a close, relaxed, and frank relationship between two or more individuals that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals. Anonymity is the desire of individuals for times of public privacy. Lastly, reserve is the creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion ; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individuals need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning himself or herself.     In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual.  Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want them to access or experience him or her. Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.       Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage .      In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion if privacy is secrecy then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed. When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.       Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of ones ownership of his or her physical and mental reality and a moral right to his or her self-determination.  Through the social ritual of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individuals privacy barriers, the social group communicates to the developing child that he or she has exclusive moral rights to his or her body—in other words, he or she has moral ownership of his or her body. This entails control over both active and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over ones movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience ones physical existence and when.     Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose.  Privacy is required to exercise choice. Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a determinate character and limited probabilities. Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.     In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent and an awareness of ones capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent.  Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the selfs boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individuals privacy.     The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept. In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffmans study of total institutions such as prisons and mental institutions,  suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate ones sense of autonomy over time.       Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers define and limit the boundaries of the self and thus serve to help define  This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others. Control over the permeability of the selfs boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.     In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism. Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to ones understanding of oneself and shapes ones sense of identity.       In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or ": null
