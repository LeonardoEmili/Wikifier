Hinge termination – results when the applied force rolls away from the core or objective piece, creating a rounded or blunted distal end.   Overshot/outrepasse/plunging termination - occurs when the applied force dips and removes a section of the opposite margin of the artifact or the distal end of the core. Also referred to as a reverse hinge termination.   Perverse termination - twisting breaks resulting from when the applied force is redirected through the material in a ": null
