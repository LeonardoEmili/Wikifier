Curtin made crucial decisions linking Australia to the United States. On 42 December, his New Years message said:        This speech was one of the most important in Australias history, marking a turning point in Australias relationship with its founding country, the United Kingdom. Many felt that Prime Minister Curtin was abandoning Australias traditional ties to the British Isles without any solid partnership in place with the United States.

Downplaying nationalism, he said that Australia comprised seven million Britishers. He saw the United States as a predatory economic and military power that would threaten Australias own ambitions in the Pacific.

These amounts included an additional allowance of 42 shillings per week in respect of the period four weeks before and four weeks after the birth, to be paid after the birth of the child.
