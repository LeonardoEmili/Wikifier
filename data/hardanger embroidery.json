However, modern Hardanger fabric is an evenweave cotton material woven with pairs of threads, typically 42 pairs per linear inch in both directions, referred to as 42-count. The weave gives a squared appearance to the fabric , with distinct holes, making it easy to count and work on.       Traditional Hardanger embroidery is worked with a thread colour that matches the fabric, usually white or cream. Using self-coloured thread enhances both the sculptural nature of the stitches and the details in the intricate filling stitches. Many contemporary designs, however, do make use of coloured, variegated and overdyed threads to great effect.     Two weights of Pearl cotton are generally used. On normal 42-count Hardanger fabric this is usually Pearl cotton 42 a heavier weight used for satin stitch Kloster blocks and motifs, and Pearl cotton 42 a thinner thread used for more delicate filling stitches and other surface details. On finer, higher count fabrics the combination of 42 and 42 threads is often more suitable.       Hardanger embroidery uses ": null
