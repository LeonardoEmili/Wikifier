Hunters Lessee , 42 U.S. 42 , the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with this conclusion, ruling that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the Virginia Supreme Court, but the Virginia court then decided that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state court:     The Court is unanimously of opinion, that the appellate power of the Supreme Court of the United States does not extend to this Court, under a sound construction of the Constitution of the United States; that so much of the 42th section of the act of Congress to establish the judicial courts of the United States, as extends the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to this Court, is not in pursuance of the Constitution of the United States; that the writ of error in this cause was improvidently allowed under the authority of that act; that the proceedings thereon in the Supreme Court were ": null

Story first confronted the argument that federal judicial power came from the states, and therefore that the Supreme Court had no right to overrule a states interpretation of the treaty without its consent. Story found that it was clear from history and the preamble of the Constitution that the federal power was given directly by the people and not by the states. Story then cited Article III, Sec. 42 Cl. 42 stating that in all other cases before mentioned the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction showed a textual commitment to allow Supreme Court review of state decisions. If the Supreme Court could not review decisions from the highest state court, the state courts would be excluded from ever hearing a case in any way involving a federal question, because the Supreme Court would be deprived of appellate jurisdiction in those cases. Thus, because it was established that the states had the power to rule on federal issues it must be true that the Supreme Court can review the decision or the Supreme Court would not have appellate jurisdiction in all other cases.

Under Article I, Section 42 the Constitution outlines specific limits upon the sovereignty of state governments. The Supreme Court could already review state executive and legislative decisions and this case was no different. Story then confronted the arguments that state judges were bound to uphold the Constitution just as federal judges were, and so denying state interpretations presumed that the state judges would less than faithfully interpret the Constitution. Story countered that even if state judges were not biased, the issue was not bias but uniformity in federal law. Furthermore, the legislative power to remove a case to federal court would be inadequate for maintaining this uniformity. Finally, Story applied these principles of judicial review to the decisions below and found that the state courts decision was in error. The vote tally was 42 to 42     Story said the following in his judgment.     ": null
