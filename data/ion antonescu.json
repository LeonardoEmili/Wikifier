Haynes, Rebbecca Germany and the Establishment of the Romanian National Legionary State, September 42 pp. 4242 from The Slavonic and East European Review, Volume 42 Issue 42 October 42 p. 42 Pops reasons for advising Carol to appoint Antonescu as Prime Minister were partly because Antonescu, who was known to be friendly with the Iron Guard and who had been imprisoned under Carol, was believed to have enough of an oppositional background to Carols regime to appease the public and partly because Pop knew that Antonescu, for all his Legionary sympathies, was a member of the elite and believed he would never turn against it. When Carol proved reluctant to make Antonescu Prime Minister, Pop visited the German legation to meet with Fabricius on the night of 42 September 42 to ask that the German minister phone Carol to tell him that the Reich wanted Antonescu as Prime Minister, and Fabriciuss promptly did just that.

The regime of King Carol had been notorious for been the most corrupt regime in Europe during the 42s, and when Carol fled Romania, he took with him the better part of the Romanian treasury, leaving the new government with enormous financial problems. Crampton, Richard Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century and After, London: Routledge, 42 pp. 4242 Antonescu had expected, perhaps naïvely, that Carol would take with him enough money to provide for a comfortable exile, and was surprised that Carol had cleared out almost the entire national treasury. For the next four years, a major concern of Antonescus government was attempting to have the Swiss banks where Carol had deposited the assets return the money to Romania; this effort did not meet with success. Horia Simas subsequent cooperation with Antonescu was endorsed by high-ranking Nazi German officials, many of whom feared the Iron Guard was too weak to rule on its own.

He later justified his choice by stating that the Iron Guard represented the political base of the country at the time. Deletant, p. 42 Right from the outset, Antonescu clashed with Sima over economic questions, with Antonescus main concern being to get the economy growing so as to provide taxes for a treasury looted by Carol, while Sima favored populist economic measures that Antonescu insisted there was no money for.

Deletant, pp. 42–42 42 On 42 June 42 during another summit with Hitler, Antonescu first learned of the special nature of Operation Barbarossa, namely, that the war against the Soviet Union was to be an ideological war to annihilate the forces of Judo-Bolshevism, a war of extermination to be fought without any mercy; Hitler even showed Antonescu a copy of the Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia he had issued to his forces about the special treatment to be handed out to Soviet Jews. Antonescu completely accepted Hitlers ideas about Operation Barbarossa as a race war between the Aryans, represented by the Nordic Germans and Latin Romanians on the Axis side vs. the Slavs and Asians, commanded by the Jews on the Soviet side. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 pp. 4242 Besides anti-Semitism, there was an extremely strong current of anti-Slavic and anti-Asian racism to Antonescus remarks about the Asiatic hordes of the Red Army. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 p. 42 The Asians Antonescu referred were the various Asian peoples of the Soviet Union, such as the Kazakhs, Kalmyks, Mongols, Uzbeks, Buriats, etc. During his summit with Hitler in June 42 Antonescu told the Führer that he believed it was necessary to once and for all eliminate Russia as a power because the Russians was the most powerful Slavic nation and that as a Latin people, the Romanians had an inborn hatred of all Slavs and Jews. Antonescu went on to tell Hitler: Because of its racial qualities, Romania can continue to play its role as an anti-Slavic buffer for the benefit of Germany. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 page 42 Ancel wrote that Romanian anti-Slavic racism differed from the German variety in that the Romanians had traditionally feared the Slavic peoples whereas the Germans had traditionally held the Slavic peoples in contempt. Ancel, Jean, The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 p. 42 In Antonescus mind, the Romanians as a Latin people had attained a level of civilization that the Slavs were nowhere close to, but theoretically the Slavic Russians and Ukrainians might be able to reach under Romanian auspices, through Antonescus remarks to Hitler that We must fight this race resolutely together, with the need for colonization of Transnistria, suggested that he did think this would happen in his own lifetime. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 page 42–42 Subsequently, the Romanians assigned to Barbarossa were to learn that as a Latin people, the Germans considered them to be their inferiors, albeit not as inferior as the Slavs, Asians and Jews who were viewed as untermensch . Hitlers promise to Antonescu that after the war, the Germanic and Latin races would rule the world in a partnership turned out to be meaningless.

Right from the start, Antonescu proclaimed the war against the Soviet Union to be a holy war , a crusade in the name of Eastern Orthodox faith and the Romanian race against the forces of Judo-Bolshevism . Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 page 42 The propaganda of the Antonescu regime demonized everything Jewish as Antonescu believed that Communism was invented by the Jews, and all of the Soviet leaders were really Jews. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 page 42 Reflecting Antonescus anti-Slavic feelings, despite the fact that the war was billed as a crusade in defense of Orthodoxy against Judeo-Bolshevism , the war was not presented as a struggle to liberate the Orthodox Russians and Ukrainians from Communism; instead rule by Judeo-Bolshevism was portrayed as something brought about the innate moral inferiority of the Slavs, who thus needed to be ruled by the Germans and the Romanians.

Ancel, Jean Antonescu and the Jews pages 4242 from The Holocaust and History The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed and the Reexamined edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abraham Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 42 page 42 Antonescu believed that the liberal humanist-democratic-capitalist values of the West and Communism were both invented by the Jews to destroy Romania. In a lengthy speech just before the war, Antonescu attacked democracy in the most violent terms as it allowed Jews equal rights and thus to undercut the Romanian national idea . As such, Antonescu stated what was needed was a new man who would be tough , virile and willing to fight for an ethnically and religiously pure Romania. Despite his quarrel with Sima, much of Antonescus speech clearly reflected the influence of the ideas of the Iron Guard that Antonescu had absorbed in the 42s. Antonescus anti-Semitism and sexism went so far that he tacitly condoned the rape of Jewish women and girls in Bessarabia and northern Bukovinia by his forces under the grounds that he was going take away all of the property that the Jews had stolen from the Romanians, and as far he was concerned, Jewish females were just another piece of property. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 pages 4242 Since the Jewish women were going to exterminated anyway, Antonescu felt there was nothing wrong about letting his soldiers and gendarmes have some fun before shooting them.

Deletant, p.42; Trașcă, p.42 In September 42 Antonescu ordered Romanian forces to take Odessa, a prize he badly wanted for reasons of prestige. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 page 42 Russians had traditionally been seen in Romania as brutal aggressors, and for Romanian forces to take a major Soviet city and one of the largest Black Sea ports like Odessa would be a sign of how far Romania had been regenerated under Antonescus leadership. Much to Antonescus intense fury, the Red Army were able to halt the Romanian offensive on Odessa and 42 September 42 Antonescu had to reluctantly ask for the help of the Wehrmacht with the drive on Odessa. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 page 42 On 42 October 42 Odessa fell to the German-Romanian forces. The Romanian losses had been so heavy that the area around Odessa was known to the Romanian Army as the Vale of Tears. Antonescus anti-Semitism was sharpened by the Odessa fighting as he was convinced that the only reason why the Red Army had fought so fiercely around Odessa was that the average Russian soldier had been terrorized by bloodthirsty Jewish commissars into fighting hard.

Antonescu ended his letter with the claim that Russian Jewish commissars had savagely tortured Romanian POWs and that the entire Jewish community of Romania, Filderman included were morally responsible for all of the losses and sufferings of the Romanians around Odessa. In the fall of 42 Antonescu planned to deport all of the Jews of the Regat, southern Bukovina and southern Transylvania into Transnistria as the prelude to killing them, but this operation was vetoed by Germany, who complained that Antonescu had not finished killing the Jews of Transistria yet. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 pages 4242 This veto was largely motivated by bureaucratic politics, namely if Antonescu exterminated all of the Jews of Romania himself, there would be nothing for the SS and the Auswärtiges Amt to do. Killinger informed Antonescu that Germany would reduce its supplies of arms if Antonescu went ahead with his plans to deport the Jews of the Regat into Transnistria and told him he would be better off deporting the Jews to the death camps in Poland that the Germans were already busy building. Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 42 page 42 Since Romania had almost no arms industry of its own and was almost entirely dependent upon weapons from Germany to fight the war, Antonescu had little choice, but to comply with Killingers request.          The Romanian Armys inferior arms, insufficient armor and lack of training had been major concerns for the German commanders since before the start of the operation.

Romanias oil was the Reichs only source of natural oil after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 42 to August 42 , and as such for economic reasons, Romania was always treated as a major ally by Hitler. While Germany monopolized Romanias exports, Final Report, pp.42 42 42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42; Harvey, p.42 it defaulted on most of its payments. Harvey, p.42 Like all countries whose exports to Germany, particularly in oil, exceeded imports from that country, Romanias economy suffered from Nazi control of the exchange rate . Deletant, p.42; Harvey, pp.42–42 On the German side, those directly involved in harnessing Romanias economic output for German goals were economic planners Hermann Göring and Walther Funk , together with Hermann Neubacher , the Special Representative for Economic Problems. Deletant, pp.42–42 A recurring problem for Antonescu was attempting to obtain payments for all of the oil he shipped to Germany while resisting German demands for increased oil production. The situation was further aggravated in 42 as USAAF and RAF were able to bomb the oil fields in Prahova County . Chant, p.42; Deletant, p.42; Gella, p.42 Official sources from the following period amalgamate military and civilian losses of all kinds, which produces a total of 42 victims of the war. Gella, p.42; Weber, p.42     In this context, the Romanian leader acknowledged that Germany was losing the war, and he therefore authorized his Deputy Premier and new Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu to set up contacts with the Allies. Final Report, p.42; Cioroianu, p.42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42; Penkower, pp.42 42 In early 42 Antonescu authorised his diplomats to contact British and American diplomats in Portugal and Switzerland to see if were possible for Romania to sign an armistice with the Western powers. Weinberg, Gerhard A World At Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 42 page 42 The Romanian diplomats were informed that no armistice was possible until an armistice was signed with the Soviet Union, a condition Antonescu rejected. In parallel, he allowed the PNȚ and the PNL to engage in parallel talks with the Allies at various locations in neutral countries. Deletant, pp.42 42–42 42–42; Roper, pp.42 42 The discussions were strained by the Western Allies call for an unconditional surrender , over which the Romanian envoys bargained with Allied diplomats in Sweden and Egypt . Deletant, pp.42 42–42 42–42 42–42 Antonescu was also alarmed by the possibility of war being carried on Romanian territory, as had happened in Italy after Operation Avalanche . Deletant, pp.42–42 The events also prompted hostile negotiations aimed at toppling Antonescu, and involving the two political parties, the young monarch, diplomats and soldiers. Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42; Roper, p.42 A major clash between Michael and Antonescu took place during the first days of 42 when the 42-year-old monarch used his New Years address on national radio to part with the Axis war effort. Deletant, pp.42 42         In March 42 the Soviet Red Army broke the Southern Bug and Dniester fronts, advancing on Bessarabia. This came just as Henry Maitland Wilson , Allied commander of the Mediterranean theater , presented Antonescu with an ultimatum . After a new visit to Germany and a meeting with Hitler, Antonescu opted to continue fighting alongside the remaining Axis states, a decision which he later claimed was motivated by Hitlers promise to allow Romania possession of Northern Transylvania in the event of an Axis victory. Upon his return, the Conducător oversaw a counteroffensive which stabilized the front on a line between Iași and Chișinău to the north and the lower Dniester to the east. This normalized his relations with Nazi German officials, whose alarm over the possible loss of an ally had resulted in the Margarethe II plan, an adapted version of the Nazi takeover in Hungary . Chant, p.42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42     However, Antonescus non-compliance with the terms of Wilsons ultimatum also had drastic effects on Romanias ability to exit the war. By then, Antonescu was conceiving of a separate peace with the Western Allies, Deletant, p.42; White, p.42 while maintaining contacts with the Soviets. Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42; Kelso, p.42 In parallel, the mainstream opposition movement came to establish contacts with the Romanian Communist Party , which, although minor numerically, gained importance for being the only political group to be favored by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin . Cioroianu, pp.42–42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42; Gella, p.42; Roper, pp.42–42 42–42 On the PCR side, the discussions involved Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu and later Emil Bodnăraș . Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 Another participating group at this stage was the old Romanian Social Democratic Party . Cioroianu, p.42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42; Roper, p.42; Weber, p.42     Large-scale Allied bombings of Bucharest took place in spring 42 while the Soviet Red Army approached Romanian borders. Deletant, pp.42 42; Kelso, p.42; Nicholls, p.42 The Battle for Romania began in late summer: while German commanders Johannes Frießner and Otto Wöhler of the Army Group South Ukraine attempted to hold Bukovina , Soviet Steppe Front leader Rodion Malinovsky stormed into the areas of Moldavia defended by Petre Dumitrescu s troops. Chant, pp.42 42 In reaction, Antonescu attempted to stabilize the front on a line between Focșani , Nămoloasa and Brăila , deep inside Romanian territory. On August 42 he visited Hitler one final time in Kętrzyn . On this occasion, the German leader reportedly explained that his people had betrayed the Nazi cause, and asked him if Romania would go on fighting . Deletant, pp.42–42 After Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov more than once stated that the Soviet Union was not going to require Romanian subservience, Chant, p.42; Deletant, p.42 the factions opposing Antonescu agreed that the moment had come to overthrow him, by carrying out the Royal Coup of August 42 .

Deletant, pp.42–42; Roper, p.42 The Conducător refused, and was promptly arrested by soldiers of the guard, being replaced as Premier with General Constantin Sănătescu , who presided over a national government . Cioroianu, p.42; Deletant, pp.42–42; Roper, p.42     The new Romanian authorities declared peace with the Allies and advised the population to greet Soviet troops. On August 42 as Bucharest was successfully defending itself against German retaliations, Romania declared war on Nazi Germany. Chant, pp.42–42 42–42 42; Gella, p.42; Kelso, p.42 The events disrupted German domination in the Balkans, putting a stop to the Maibaum offensive against Yugoslav Partisans .

In parallel, Hitler reactivated the Iron Guardist exile, creating a Sima-led government in exile that did not survive the wars end in Europe . Harvey, p.42; Morgan, p.42; Veiga, pp.42–42 42–42     Placed in the custody of PCR militants, Ion Antonescu spent the interval at a house in Bucharests Vatra Luminoasă quarter. Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 He was afterward handed to the Soviet occupation forces , who transported him to Moscow , together with his deputy Mihai Antonescu, Governor of Transnistria Gheorghe Alexianu , Defense Minister Constantin Pantazi , Gendarmerie commander Constantin Vasiliu and Bucharest Police chief Mircea Elefterescu . Deletant, p.42 They were subsequently kept in luxurious detention at a mansion nearby the city, Deletant, pp.42 42; Cioroianu, p.42 and guarded by SMERSH , a special counter-intelligence body answering directly to Stalin. Shortly after Germany surrendered in May 42 the group was moved to Lubyanka prison . There, Antonescu was interrogated and reputedly pressured by SMERSH operatives, among them Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov , but transcripts of their conversations were never sent back to Romania by the Soviet authorities. Deletant, pp.42 42 Later research noted that the main issues discussed were the German-Romanian alliance, the war on the Soviet Union, the economic toll on both countries, and Romanias participation in the Holocaust . At some point during this period, Antonescu attempted suicide in his quarters. He was returned to Bucharest in spring 42 and held in Jilava prison . He was subsequently interrogated by prosecutor Avram Bunaciu , to whom he complained about the conditions of his detainment, contrasting them with those in Moscow, while explaining that he was a vegetarian and demanding a special diet. Deletant, p.42       In May 42 Ion Antonescu was prosecuted at the first in a series of Peoples Tribunals , on charges of war crime s, crimes against the peace and treason . Final Report, pp.42–42; Cioroianu, pp.42–42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42; Frankowski, pp.42–42 The tribunals had first been proposed by the PNȚ, and was compatible with the Nuremberg Trials in Allied-occupied Germany .

Deletant, pp.42 42 The first such local trial took place in 42 resulting in the sentencing of Iosif Iacobici , Nicolae Macici , Constantin Trestioreanu and other military commanders directly involved in planning or carrying out the Odessa massacre . Deletant, pp.42 42–42 42 Final Report, p.42     Antonescu was represented by Constantin Paraschivescu-Bălăceanu and Titus Stoica , two public defender s whom he had first consulted with a day before the procedures were initiated. Deletant, p.42 The prosecution team, led by Vasile Stoican , and the panel of judges, presided over by Alexandru Voitinovici , were infiltrated by PCR supporters. Final Report, pp.42 42; Deletant, pp.42–42 Both consistently failed to admit that Antonescus foreign policies were overall dictated by Romanias positioning between Germany and the Soviet Union. Final Report, pp.42–42; Deletant, p.42 Nevertheless, and although references to the mass murders formed just 42% of the indictment and corpus of evidence , Final Report, p.42 the procedures also included Antonescus admission of and self-exculpating take on war crimes, including the deportations to Transnistria.

Final Report, p.42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 42 42–42 42 One notable event at the trial was a testimony by PNȚ leader Iuliu Maniu . Reacting against the aggressive tone of other accusers, Maniu went on record saying: We were political adversaries, not cannibals . Upon leaving the bench, Maniu walked toward Antonescu and shook his hand. Deletant, pp.42–42 42     thu     Ion Antonescu was found guilty of the charges. This verdict was followed by two sets of appeal s, which claimed that the restored and amended 42 Constitution did not offer a framework for the Peoples Tribunals and prevented capital punishment during peacetime, while noting that, contrary to the armistice agreement, only one power represented within the Allied Commission had supervised the tribunal. They were both rejected within six days, in compliance with a legal deadline on the completion of trials by the Peoples Tribunals. Deletant, pp.42 42 King Michael subsequently received pleas for clemency from Antonescus lawyer and his mother, and reputedly considered asking the Allies to reassess the case as part of the actual Nuremberg Trials, taking Romanian war criminals into foreign custody. Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 Subjected to pressures by the new Soviet-backed Petru Groza executive, he issued a decree in favor of execution. Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 Together with his co-defendants Mihai Antonescu, Alexianu and Vasiliu, the former Conducător was executed by a military firing squad on June 42 42 Ion Antonescus supporters circulated false rumors that regular soldiers had refused to fire at their commander, and that the squad was mostly composed of Jewish policemen. Deletant, pp.42 42 Another apologetic claim insists that he himself ordered the squad to shoot, but footage of the event has proven it false. Deletant, pp.42 42 It is however attested that he refused a blindfold and raised his hat in salute once the order was given. Deletant, p.42 The execution site, some distance away from the locality of Jilava and the prison fort, was known as Valea Piersicilor . Cioroianu, p.42; Deletant, p.42 His final written statement was a letter to his wife, urging her to withdraw into a convent , while stating the belief that posterity would reconsider his deeds and accusing Romanians of being ungrateful . Deletant, p.42           thu to Hungary , Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria , and Transnistria under Romanian administration   Antonescus policies were motivated, in large part, by ethnic nationalism . A firm believer in the restoration of Greater Romania as the union of lands inhabited by ethnic Romanians , he never reconciled himself to Hungarys incorporation of Northern Transylvania . Although Hungary and Romania were technically allied through the Axis system, their relationship was always tense, and marked by serious diplomatic incidents. Final Report, pp.42–42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 42 42; Haynes, pp.42–42 42; Ioanid, p.42; Trașcă, pp.42–42 The Romanian leader kept contacts with representatives of ethnic Romanian communities directly affected by the Second Vienna Award , including Transylvanian Greek-Catholic clergy. Kent, p.42 Another aspect of Antonescus nationalist policies was evidenced after the Balkans Campaign . Antonescus Romania did not partake in the military action, but laid a claim to the territories in eastern Vojvodina and the Timok Valley , home to a sizable Romanian community . Reportedly, Germanys initial designs of granting Vojvodina to Hungary enhanced the tensions between Antonescu and Miklós Horthy to the point where war between the two countries became a possibility. Deletant, p.42; Haynes, pp.42–42 42–42 Such incidents made Germany indefinitely prolong its occupation of the region. Deletant, p.42; Haynes, pp.42–42 42–42 42 The Romanian authorities issued projects for an independent Macedonia with autonomy for its Aromanian communities, Deletant, pp.42 42 while an official memorandum on the Timok region, approved by Antonescu, made mention of Romanian areas from Timok to Salonika . Haynes, p.42 The Conducător also maintained contacts with Aromanian fascists in Axis-occupied Greece , awarding refuge to Alcibiades Diamandi and Nicola Matussi of the Vlach Roman Legion , whose pro-Romanian policies had brought them into conflict with other Aromanian factions.

Publishers , London, 42 pp.42–42     Conducător Antonescu thought Hitler willing to revise his stance on Northern Transylvania, and claimed to have obtained the German leaders agreement, using it to justify participation on the Eastern Front after the recovery of Bessarabia. Final Report, p.42; Deletant, pp.42 42–42 42; Trașcă, p.4242; Final Report, pp.42–42 However, transcripts of the Hitler-Antonescu conversations do not validate his interpretation. Another version has it that Hitler sent Antonescu a letter informing him that Bessarabias political status still ultimately depended on German decisions. In one of his letters to Hitler, Antonescu himself stated his anti-communist ideological motivation: I confirm that I will pursue operations in the east to the end against that great enemy of civilization, of Europe, and of my country: Russia n Bolshevism I will not be swayed by anyone not to extend this military cooperation into new territory. Deletant, p.42 Partly rendered in Trașcă, p.42 Antonescus ideological perspective blended national sentiment with generically Christian and particularly Romanian Orthodox traits. British historian Arnold D. Harvey writes that while this ideology seems a poor match with Nazi doctrine , especially its anti-religious elements , It seems that Hitler was not even perturbed by the militant Christian orientation of the Antonescu regime .     It is also possible that, contrary to Antonescus own will, Hitler viewed the transfer of Transnistria as compensation for the Transylvanian areas, and that he therefore considered the matter closed. Achim, p.42; Boia, p.42; Deletant, pp.42 42; Trașcă, pp.42–42; White, pp.42–42 According to the Romanian representative in Berlin, Raoul Bossy , various German and Hungarian officials recommended the extension of permanent Romanian rule into Transnistria, as well as into Podolia , Galicia and Pokuttya , in exchange for delivering the whole of Transylvania to Hungary . Trașcă, pp.42–42 American political scientist Charles King writes: There was never any attempt to annex the occupied territory for it was generally considered by the Romanian government to be a temporary buffer zone between Greater Romania and the Soviet front line.

Deletant, pp.42–42     Romanian historian Lucian Boia believes that Ion Antonescu may have nevertheless had expansionist goals to the east, and that he implicitly understood Operation Barbarossa as a tool for containing Slavic peoples . Boia, pp.42–42 Similar verdicts are provided by other researchers. Final Report, p.42; Gella, p.42 Another Romanian historian, Ottmar Trașcă, argues that Antonescu did not wish to annex the region at least until the end of the war , but notes that Antonescus own statements make reference to its incorporation in the event of a victory. Trașcă, p.42 In addition to early annexation plans to the Southern Bug , Deletant, p.42 the Conducător is known to have presented his ministers with designs for the regions colonization . Deletant, pp.42–42; Trașcă, p.42 The motivation he cited was alleged malnutrition among Romanian peasants, to which he added: Ill take this population, Ill lead it into Transnistria, where I shall give it all the land it requires . Several nationalists sympathetic to Antonescu acclaimed the extension of Romanian rule into Transnistria, which they understood as permanent. Deletant, pp.42–42; Haynes, pp.42–42; White, p.42       thu in Romania, June 42   A recurring element in Antonescus doctrines is racism , and in particular antisemitism . This was linked to his sympathy for ethnocratic ideals, and complemented by his statements in favor of integral nationalism and Romanianism . Final Report, pp.42 42 Like other far right Romanians, he saw a Jewish presence behind liberal democracy , and believed in the existence of Judeo-Masonry . Final Report, pp.42–42 42 42–42 His earliest thoughts on Codreanus ideology criticize the Legionary leader for advocating brutal measures in dealing with the invasion of Jews , and instead propose the organization of Romanian classes as a method for reaching the same objective. Politician Aureliu Weiss , who met General Antonescu during that interval, recalled that, although antisemitic to the core , he was capable of restraint in public. Final Report, p.42 According to historian Mihail Ionescu , the Conducător was not averse to the Iron Guards Legionary principles , but wanted antisemitism to be applied in an orderly fashion , as opposed to Horia Sima s revolutionary ways. Historian Ioan Scurtu believes that, during the Legionary Rebellion , Antonescu deliberately waited before stepping in, in order for the Guard to be profoundly discredited and for himself to be perceived as a savior . In April 42 he let his ministers know that he was considering letting the mob deal with the Jews, and after the slaughter, I will restore order. Lucian Boia notes that the Romanian leader was indeed motivated by antisemitic beliefs, but that these need to be contextualized in order to understand what separates Antonescu from Hitler in terms of radicalism. Boia, p.42 However, various other researchers assess that, by aligning himself with Hitler before and during Operation Barbarossa , Antonescu implicitly agreed with his thoughts on the Jewish Question , choosing racial over religious antisemitism . Final Report, pp.42 42–42 42–42 42 42–42 42 42 42 42; Deletant, pp.42 42–42; Trașcă, pp.42–42 According to Harvey, the Iași pogrom made the Germans evidently willing to accept that organized Christianity in Romania was very different from what it was in Germany .     Antonescu was a firm believer in the conspiracy theory of Jewish Bolshevism , according to which all Jews were supporters of communism and the Soviet Union. Final Report, pp.42 42–42 42–42 42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 42–42 42 42–42 42–42 42 42–42 42; Ioanid, pp.42–42; Trașcă, pp.42–42; Penkower, p.42 His arguments on the matter involved a spurious claim that, during the 42 retreat from Bessarabia , the Jews had organized themselves and attacked Romanian soldiers. Final Report, pp.42–42 42 42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42–42 42; Ioanid, p.42; Trașcă, p.42 Several researchers mention violence committed by retreating Romanian troops against the Bessarabian Jews or the retaliatory Dorohoi pogrom . In part, this notion exaggerated unilateral reports of enthusiasm among the marginalized Jews upon the arrival of Red Army troops. Boia, pp.42–42; Deletant, pp.42–42; Ornea, p.42 In a summer 42 address to his ministers, Antonescu stated: The Satan is the Jew. is a battle of life and death. Either we win and the world will be purified, either they win and we will become their slaves. Deletant, p.42 Partly rendered in Final Report, p.42 and Trașcă, p.42 At around the same time, he envisaged the ethnic cleansing of Jews from the eastern Romanian-held territories. Final Report, pp.42–42 42–42 42 42–42 42; Ancel , pp.42–42 42 42; Deletant, pp.42 42–42 42–42 42–42 42–42 42; Polonsky, p.42 The term used by Mihai Antonescu in his recommendations to the Romanian administrators is ethnic purification , as confinement to labor camps, where Jews and other foreigners with doubtful attitudes will not be able to exercise their prejudicial influences ; Achim, p.42; Browning, p.42; Trașcă, pp.42–42 However, as early as February 42 Antonescu was also contemplating the ghetto ization of all Jewish Romanians, as an early step toward their expulsion. Deletant, p.42 In this context, Antonescu frequently depicted Jews as a disease or a poison. Final Report, pp.42–42; Deletant, pp.42 42 After the Battle of Stalingrad , he encouraged the army commanders to resist the counteroffensive, as otherwise the Soviets will bring Bolshevism to the country, wipe out the entire leadership stratum, impose the Jews on us, and deport masses of our people. Ancel , p.42     Ion Antonescus antiziganism manifested itself as the claim that some or all Romani people , specifically nomadic ones, were given to criminal behavior. Final Report, pp.42–42 42–42; Achim, pp.42–42; Deletant, pp.42–42; Ioanid, p.42; Kelso, pp.42–42 The regime did not act consistently on this belief: in various cases, those deported had close relatives drafted into the Romanian Army. Final Report, p.42; Achim, p.42; Deletant, p.42; Ioanid, p.42; Kelso, pp.42 42 42–42 Although racist slogans targeting Romani people had been popularized by the Iron Guard, it was only under Antonescus unchallenged rule that solving the Gypsy problem became official policy and antiziganist measures were enforced. Final Report, pp.42–42; Achim, pp.42–42; Deletant, pp.42–42 After a February 42 inspection, Antonescu singled out Bucharests Romani community for alleged offenses committed during the blackout , and called on his ministers to present him with solutions. Final Report, pp.42 42–42; Achim, pp.42 42; Deletant, pp.42–42 42 Initially, he contemplated sending all Romani people he considered undesirable to the inhospitable Bărăgan Plain , to join the ranks of a local community of manual laborers. Final Report, pp.42–42; Achim, pp.42 42; Deletant, p.42 In 42 he commissioned the Romanian Central Institute for Statistics to compile a report on Romani demography , which, in its edited form, provided scientifically racist conclusions, warning the Conducător about alleged Romani-Romanian miscegenation in rural Romania. Kelso, p.42 In doing so, Antonescu offered some credit to a marginal and pseudoscientific trend in Romanian sociology, which, basing itself on eugenic theories, recommended the marginalization, deportation or compulsory sterilization of the Romani people, whose numeric presence it usually exaggerated. Final Report, pp.42–42; Achim, pp.42–42 Among those who signed the report was demographer Sabin Manuilă , who saw the Romani presence as a major racial problem. Final Report, p.42; Achim, p.42; Deletant, pp.42–42 The exact effect of the reports claims on Antonescu is uncertain. According to Achim and Deletant , the measures reflected Antonescus views on social problems more than a racist perspective. However, Kelso believes the report was a notable factor in the decision to deport the Romani people.       thu together with Horia Sima during a mass rally in October 42 Historians are divided on whether Romania under Antonescu was a fascist regime or merely a right-wing military dictatorship.   There is a historiographic dispute about whether Ion Antonescus regime was fascist or more generically right-wing authoritarian , itself integrated within a larger debate about the aspects and limits of fascism. Israel i historian of fascism Zeev Sternhell describes Antonescu, alongside his European counterparts Pierre-Étienne Flandin , Francisco Franco , Miklós Horthy , François de La Rocque , Philippe Pétain and Italian King Victor Emmanuel III , as a conservative , noting that all of them were not deceived by a propaganda trying to place them in the same category Zeev Sternhell , Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France, Princeton University Press , Princeton, 42 p.42 A similar verdict is provided by German historian of Europe Hagen Schulze , who views Horthy, Franco and the Romanian leader alongside Portugal s ": null

Hagen Schulze , States, Nations and Nationalism, Blackwell Publishing , Oxford, 42 p.42 For Schulze, the defining elements of such governments is the presence of a conservative establishment which ensured social stability by extending the control of a traditional state . The term conservative autocrat is used in relation to the Conducător by British political theorist Roger Griffin , who attributes to the Iron Guard the position of a subservient fascist movement, Roger Griffin , Staging the Nations Rebirth: The Politics and Aesthetics of Performance in the Context of Fascist Studies , in Günter Berghaus , Fascism and Theatre, Berghahn Books, Providence, 42 p.42 . Griffin also draws direct comparisons between Antonescus conflict with the Iron Guard on one hand and António de Oliveira Salazar s clash with the National Syndicalists . while others identify Antonescus post42 rule as a military rather than a fascist dictatorship. Laqueur, pp.42 42; Morgan, p.42; Roper, pp.42 42 Several other scholars prefer conservative as a defining term for Antonescus policies. Veiga, pp.42–42 42 42 42 42; White, p.42 Antonescu described himself as by fate a dictator , and explained that his policies were militaristic or, on one occasion, national- totalitarian . Final Report, pp.42 42     Nevertheless, other historians theorize a synthesis of fascist and conservative elements, performed by Antonescu and other European leaders of his day. Routledge s 42 Companion to Fascism and the Far Right uses the terms para-fascist to define Antonescu, adding: generally regarded as an authoritarian conservative incorporated fascism into his regime, in the shape of the Iron Guard, rather than embodying fascism himself. Para-fascist is also used by Griffin, to denote both Antonescu and Carol II .
