By January 42 Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridges advice, Bragg ordered the 42nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, if should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to my memory and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it.      Breckinridges men initially broke the Union line and forced them across the river.
