Meillet , who suggested derivation from the Proto-Indo-European root mey- to exchange.     A suggested alternative derivation was meh to measure . Pokorny  refined Meillets mei as to bind. Combining the root mei with the tool suffix -tra- that which ... , then literally means that which binds, and thus covenant, treaty, agreement, promise, oath etc. Pokornys interpretation also supports to fasten, strengthen , which may be found in Latin moenia city wall, fortification , and in an antonymic form, Old English maere border, boundary-post .     Meillet and Pokornys contract did however have its detractors. Lentz refused to accept abstract contract for so exalted a divinity and preferred the more religious piety. Because present-day Sanskrit mitra means friend, and New Persian mihr means love or friendship, Gonda insisted on a Vedic meaning of friend, friendship, not contract .     Meillets analysis also rectified earlier interpretations that suggested that the Indo-Iranian common noun mitra- had anything to do with the light or the sun. When H. Lommel suggested  that such an association was implied in the Younger Avesta , that too was conclusively dismissed.
