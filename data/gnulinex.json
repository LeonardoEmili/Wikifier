Extremadura has changed the names of many programs installed by default with the distribution, which has caused some confusion amongst users. Some see it as a virtue for helping them to remember their favorite applications with Spanish instead of English names. The 42 version includes the possibility of choosing the original icons and names of all the applications included in gnuLinEx.       School LinEx is a gnuLinEx variant oriented toward teachers. It consists of three user profiles. Each profile is personalised for a particular student with content and software for each pupil.          , written by Dario Rapisardi                            ": null
