The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured but the relationship between the two can be complex.  For example, the ATP and NADPH energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C 3 plants. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks.    For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.        Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and Infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction.  It is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together.  Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO 2 , and of ΔH 2 O using reliable methods  CO 2 is commonly measured in μmols/m 2 /s −1 , parts per million or volume per million and H 2 0 is commonly measured in mmol/m 2 /s −1 or in mbars. By measuring CO 2 assimilation, ΔH 2 O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes possible to estimate, “A” or carbon assimilation, “E” or transpiration, “gs” or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO 2 . However, it is more common to used chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used measuring parameters FV/FM and Y or F/FM’ can be made in a few seconds, allowing the measurement of larger plant populations.     Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO 2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO 2 levels, to characterize a plants photosynthetic response.     Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms. While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO 2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of C C to replace Ci.  The estimation of CO 2 at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, or C C , becomes possible with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or g m using an integrated system.      Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf. But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO 2 assimilation rates. With some instruments even wavelength-dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.      A phenomenon known as ": null

The excitons wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously choose the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic hop . The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.                  Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in ": null
