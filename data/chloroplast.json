Paulinella chromatophora  Paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently.

Being in the early stages of endosymbiosis, Paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved.

Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA.
