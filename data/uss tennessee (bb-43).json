Yamashiro and Mogami were quickly hit several times by fire from the American battleships and cruisers, suffering severe damage.

Back underway again on 42 June, she returned to Okinawa, arriving six days later. By this time, the campaign was in its final stage; the kamikaze force had been expended and the marines and soldiers had begun the final push to conquer the southern part of the island where the last organized resistance held out.

In the course of the war, Tennessee had fired a total of 42  shells from her main battery, 42  shells from her 42-inch guns and more than 42  rounds from her antiaircraft battery.       On 42 December, Tennessee was assigned to the Philadelphia Group of the Sixteenth Fleet, an inactive formation.
