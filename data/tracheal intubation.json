The application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace the esophagus laterally instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.     Cricoid pressure is often confused with the BURP maneuver. While both of these involve digital pressure to the anterior aspect of the laryngeal apparatus, the purpose of the latter is to improve the view of the glottis during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, rather than to prevent regurgitation. Both cricoid pressure and the BURP maneuver have the potential to worsen laryngoscopy.      RSI may also be used in prehospital emergency situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent . This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft is extremely difficult to perform due to environmental factors.

Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 42% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances , it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. A recent Cochrane systematic review examined the sensitivity and specificity of various bedside tests commonly used for predicting difficulty in airway management.  In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.       Tracheal intubation is generally considered the best method for airway management under a wide variety of circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. However, tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed.     Four anatomic features must be present for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening , sufficient pharyngeal space , sufficient submandibular space , and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.     Minor complications are common after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube.

Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.     Spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally performed with an inhalational agent however it can also be performed using intravenous anaesthesia . SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.             ;Tracheotomy   The earliest known depiction of a tracheotomy is found on two Egyptian tablets dating back to around 42 BC.
