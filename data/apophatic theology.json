According to Deirdre Carabine,          According to Fagenblat, negative theology is as old as philosophy itself; elements of it can be found in Platos unwritten doctrines, while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers.

According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.     The Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo, and Meredith even states that Philo is the real founder of the apophatic tradition.  Yet, it was with ": null
