On the first day of painting, Marthe entered the morning water and instinctively recoiled at its chilliness. Chabas approved of this pose, saying that it was perfect . Over the course of two summers he worked on the painting, half an hour every morning. The work was completed on a September morning in 42 giving the painting its name. In 42 responding to claims that Marthe was living in poverty, Chabas explained that she had continued posing for him until she was 42 when she married a rich industrialist, and that she was now aged 42 plump, and had three children.

According to this telling, Chabas completed the painting over three summers at Lake Annecy, though his peasant model served only as the basis for the figures body. The head was based on a sketch of a young American, Julie Phillips, which Chabas had completed upon observing her and her mother dining in Paris; finding her profile to his liking, he silently drew her, then introduced himself and apologized for his presumption .           Chabas first exhibited September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 42 to June 42 42 Because he did not plan to sell it, he gave a price of 42 francs   – more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 42 of 42 possible votes.

After less than an hour of deliberations, the jury found for Jackson, allowing him to reinstate the image in his display; Jackson was so pleased that he promised a free copy of September Morn to each juror. Ten days after the trial Mayor Harrison went to the city council and proposed stricter obscenity laws. The city government agreed, and imposed a $42–42 fine for displaying nude art along public roads and in places frequented by children. By September Jackson had been found in violation of this law.

Following Comstocks visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company, ogling September Morn. The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of September Morn, so that it could remain in his window.     After two weeks, when the dealership had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In a letter to the editor of  The New York Times , he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it.

He described the work as all I know of painting , and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. In a 42 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it was wifes favorite picture . At the time of his death in 42 Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy.  However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars.

That year, the Montreal Gazette art critic opined that the painting was banal and unacceptable for display in the Mets main hall. The reviewer suggested that September Morn, with its delicate, pearly tonality and simple, sparse, airy composition , would be best served by being displayed among works considered better by early 42th-century collectors but since reviewed poorly, to dramatiz for the public the danger of too-hasty judgments .     In 42 Blake-More Godwin of the Toledo Museum of Art stated that, although September Morn was certainly art, it was not great art and was overshadowed by the controversy it had created; the painting, he said, bears the same relationship to art as a minor poem does to the classic and the imperishable .

Several writers have included September Morn in lists of works depicting children with erotic or pornographic subtexts. ;  Brauer argues that although the nude seems to embody the moral purity at puberty , this innocence is actually a fetishistic mechanism which both allowed the work to pass the censors and be eroticised. She concludes that the painting is paedophilically provocative , and that Chabas was protected from censure by his status as an established artist and father.
