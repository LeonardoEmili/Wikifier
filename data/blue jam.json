I had this misty, autumnal, boggy mood anyway, so I just went with that. But no doubt getting to the end of something like Brass Eye, where youve been forced to be a sort of surrogate lawyer, well, thats the most creatively stifling thing you could possibly do.

        " .     Morris originally requested that the show be broadcast at 3 a.m. on Radio 1 because at that hour, on insomniac radio, the amplitude of terrible things is enormously overblown . As a compromise, the show was broadcast at midnight without much promotion. Morris reportedly included sketches too graphic or transgressive for radio that he knew would be cut so as to make his other material seem less transgressive in comparison. During the airing of episode 6 of series one, a re-editing of the Archbishop of Canterburys speech at Princess Dianas funeral was deemed too offensive for broadcast, and was switched with a different episode as it aired.         Each episode opened with a short spoken monologue describing, in surreal, broken language, various bizarre feelings and situations , set to ambient music interspersed with short clips of other songs and sounds. The introduction would always end with welcome in Blue Jam , inviting the listener, who is presumably experiencing such feelings, to get lost in the program.  The sketches within dealt with heavy and taboo topics, such as murder, suicide, missing or dead children, and rape.       Doctor : The Doctor is a seemingly normal physician working in a standard British medical practice. However, he has a habit of treating his patients in bizarre and often disturbing ways, such as prescribing heroin for a cold, making a man with a headache jump up and down in order to make his penis swing and making a patient leave and go into the next room so he can examine him over the telephone. His name is revealed to be Michael Perlin in several sketches.   The Monologue Man : Short stories, often up to 10 minutes in length, written from the perspective of a lonely and socially inept man. Each story usually involves the protagonists acquaintance Suzy in some capacity.   Michael Alexander St. John: A parody of hyperbolic and pun-laden radio presenting, St. John presents items such as the top 10 singles charts and the weekends gigs.   Bad Sex: Short clips of two lovers  making increasingly bizarre erotic requests of one another, such as to shit your leg off and make your spunk come out green .

Mr. Ventham : An extremely awkward man who requires one-to-one consultations with Mr. Reilly , who seems to be his psychologist, for the most banal of matters.     The sketches not listed are often in the style of a documentary; characters speak as if being interviewed about a recent event. In one sketch, a character voiced by Morris describes a man attempting to commit suicide by jumping off a second-story balcony repeatedly; in another, an angry man shouts about how his car, after being picked up from the garage, is only four feet long.       Morris included a series of radio stings, bizarre sequences of sounds and prose as a parody of modern DJs own soundbites and self-advertising pieces.
