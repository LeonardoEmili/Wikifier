Just a month into his presidency, Harrison died of an illness and was succeeded by Vice President John Tyler. Tyler retained Harrisons Cabinet, but quickly made it known that he had reservations about re-establishing a national bank, a key priority of Clays. Clay nonetheless initially expected that Tyler would approve the measures passed by the Whig-controlled Congress; his priorities included the re-establishment of the national bank, higher tariff rates, a national bankruptcy law, and an act to distribute the proceeds of land sales to the states for investments in infrastructure and education. Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank. Clay and other Whig leaders were outraged not only by Tylers rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.     After the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and every Cabinet member except for Webster resigned from office. Tyler increasingly moved closer to the Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.
