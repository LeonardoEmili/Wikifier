Self learning in neural networks was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named Crossbar Adaptive Array . Bozinovski, S. . A self learning system using secondary reinforcement . In R. Trappl Cybernetics and Systems Research: Proceedings of the Sixth European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research. North Holland. pp. 397–402. . It is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action a. It has neither external advice input nor external reinforcement input from the environment. The CAA computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions about encountered situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. Bozinovski, S. Modeling mechanisms of cognition-emotion interaction in artificial neural networks, since 1981. Procedia Computer Science p. 255-263 Given memory matrix W ||w||, the crossbar self learning algorithm in each iteration performs the following computation:   In situation s perform action a;   Receive consequence situation s’;   Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v;   Update crossbar memory w’ w + v.     The backpropagated value is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, where from it initially and only once receives initial emotions about to be encountered situations in the behavioral environment. Having received the genome vector from the genetic environment, the CAA will learn a goal-seeking behavior, in the behavioral environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.

Stochastic learning introduces noise into the process, using the local gradient calculated from one data point; this reduces the chance of the network getting stuck in local minima. However, batch learning typically yields a faster, more stable descent to a local minimum, since each update is performed in the direction of the batchs average error. A common compromise is to use mini-batches , small batches with samples in each batch selected stochastically from the entire data set.
