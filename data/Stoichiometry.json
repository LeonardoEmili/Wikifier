Conversely, if one reactant has a known quantity and the quantity of the products can be empirically determined, then the amount of the other reactants can also be calculated.

Stoichiometry measures these quantitative relationships, and is used to determine the amount of products and reactants that are produced or needed in a given reaction. Describing the quantitative relationships among substances as they participate in chemical reactions is known as reaction stoichiometry. In the example above, reaction stoichiometry measures the relationship between the quantities of methane and oxygen that react to form carbon dioxide and water.     Because of the well known relationship of moles to atomic weights, the ratios that are arrived at by stoichiometry can be used to determine quantities by weight in a reaction described by a balanced equation.

In complex reactions, stoichiometries are often represented in a more compact form called the stoichiometry matrix. The stoichiometry matrix is denoted by the symbol N.     If a reaction network has n reactions and m participating molecular species then the stoichiometry matrix will have correspondingly m rows and n columns.     For example, consider the system of reactions shown below:   :S 1 → S 2   :5  S 3 + S 2 → 4  S 3 + 2  S 2   :S 3 → S 4   :S 4 → S 5     This systems comprises four reactions and five different molecular species. The stoichiometry matrix for this system can be written as:     :   \\mathbf \\begin   -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\   \\end       where the rows correspond to S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , S 4 and S 5 , respectively. Note that the process of converting a reaction scheme into a stoichiometry matrix can be a lossy transformation, for example, the stoichiometries in the second reaction simplify when included in the matrix. This means that it is not always possible to recover the original reaction scheme from a stoichiometry matrix.     Often the stoichiometry matrix is combined with the rate vector, v, and the species vector, S to form a compact equation describing the rates of change of the molecular species:     :   \\frac \\mathbf \\cdot \\mathbf.
