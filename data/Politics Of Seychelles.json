A British governor described it as the embodiment of every reactionary force in Seychelles , and it was entirely concerned with protecting the interests of the plantocracy. After the war, they also benefited by being granted the right to vote, which was limited to literate property owners; just 2,000 in a population of 36,000. At the first elections in 1948, most of those elected to the Legislative Council were predictably members of the Planters and Taxpayers Association.
