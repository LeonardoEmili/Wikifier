The phrases I am a Berliner and I am proud to be in Berlin were typed already a week before the speech on a list of expressions to be used, including a phonetic transcription of the German translation. Such transcriptions are also found in the third draft of the speech , from June 25. The final typed version of the speech does not contain the transcriptions, which are added by hand by Kennedy himself.

Daum credited the origin of the phrase Ich bin ein Berliner to Kennedy and his 1962 speech in New Orleans quoted above. According to Daum, Kennedy was affected by seeing the Berlin Wall, so that he falls back on the most memorable passage of his New Orleans speech given the year before, changing pride in being an American in being a Berliner.
