This coup was carried out by 42 soldiers of the 42th and 42th Line Infantry Regiments. Huguet-Chateaus men also captured four guns but lost them to a Russian counterattack.

After bitter fighting, Sacken drove the French from most of the town, but Olsufiev failed to recapture the château. Finally, Grouchy sent Lhéritiers horsemen into the town but this gallant effort was futile. At midnight, Blücher ordered Olsufievs troops to retreat and two hours later gave Sacken instructions to withdraw. The Russian cavalry held their positions until morning.
