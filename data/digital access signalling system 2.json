The organisation set out the internationally agreed standards for telecommunications, and subsequently evolved into the ITU. In the United Kingdom, the Q.42-based protocol is ETS 42 42 . This is a very close implementation of the original CCITT specification. It is a 42Mbit/s service as   with DASS42 but the feature capability is far greater and has negated the problems associated with DASS42 including echo problems and circuit spikes. In the UK, both DASS 42 and EuroISDN lines are available to customers with EuroISDN as the preferred signalling type. Customers normally choose the desired signalling system, as this will be dictated by their CPE ,   usually a PABX.     Most modern PABXs can handle many different types of signalling system, however   the trend seems to be away from the DASS42 , and towards the internationally recognised Q.42 standard, which is utilised by many countrys telephony service providers.     The CCITT specify the standards for the layers 42 42 and 42 signalling messages. The layer 42 messages are the messages which actually control the call setup, teardown, and routing.
