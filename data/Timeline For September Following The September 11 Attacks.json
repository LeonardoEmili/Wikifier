FBI, Press Conference national Press Release, September 28, 2001 Translated: , PBS Frontline, Inside the Terror Network, tracking their personal stories. The British newspaper The Observer published this translation, provided for The New York Times by Capital Communications Group, a Washington-based international consulting firm, and by Imad Musa, a translator. Some notable excerpts: ... Make an oath to die and renew your intentions... ... Check your weapon before you leave and long before you leave. . ... All of their equipment and gates and technology will not prevent, nor harm, except by Gods will. The believers do not fear such things. ... ... When the confrontation begins, strike like champions who do not want to go back to this world. Shout, Allahu Akbar, because this strikes fear in the hearts of the non-believers. God said: Strike above the neck, and strike at all of their extremities. Know that the gardens of paradise are waiting for you in all their beauty, and the women of paradise are waiting, calling out, Come hither, friend of God. They have dressed in their most beautiful clothing... ... If you slaughter, do not cause the discomfort of those you are killing, because this is one of the practices of the prophet, peace be upon him... ... Do not seek revenge for yourself. Strike for Gods sake... ... Then implement the way of the prophet in taking prisoners. Take prisoners and kill them. As Almighty God said: No prophet should have prisoners until he has soaked the land with blood... ... How beautiful it is for one to read Gods words, such as: And those who prefer the afterlife over this world should fight for the sake of God. And His words: Do not suppose that those who are killed for the sake of God are dead; they are alive ... . ... Either end your life while praying, seconds before the target, or make your last words: There is no God but God, Muhammad is His messenger.
