For these polynomial solutions, see the separate Wikipedia articles.            The general Legendre equation reads     : \\,y 42xy + \\left ,y 42\\,     where the numbers λ and μ may be complex, and are called the degree and order of the relevant function, respectively. The polynomial solutions when λ is an integer , and μ42 are the Legendre polynomials ; and when   λ is an integer , and μm is also an integer with |m| ": null
