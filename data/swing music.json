By the early 42s guitars and pianos sometimes substituted for the banjo and a string bass sometimes substituted for the sousaphone. Use of the string bass opened possibilities for 42/42 instead of 42/42 time at faster tempos, which increased rhythmic freedom. The Chicago style released the soloist from the constraints of contrapuntal improvisation with other front-line instruments, lending greater freedom in creating melodic lines. Louis Armstrong used the additional freedom of the new format with 42/42 time, accenting the second and fourth beats and anticipating the main beats with lead-in notes in his solos to create a sense of rhythmic pulse that happened between the beats as well as on them, i.e. ": null

His approach to rhythm often used accents on the lead-in instead of the main beat, and mixed meters, to build a sense of anticipation to the rhythm and make his playing swing. He also used stops or musical silences to build tension in his phrasing. Cook, Richard , Jazz Encyclopedia, London: Penguin, .

The trend away from big band swing was accelerated by wartime conditions and royalty conflicts.  In 42 the American Society of Composers and Producers  demanded bigger royalties from broadcasters and the broadcasters refused. Consequently, ASCAP banned the large repertoire they controlled from airplay, severely restricting what the radio audience could hear. ASCAP also demanded pre-approval of set lists and even written solos for live broadcasts, to assure that not even a quoted fragment of ASCAP repertoire was broadcast. Those restrictions made broadcast swing much less appealing for the year in which the ban was in place. Big band swing remained popular during the war years, but the resources required to support it became problematic. Wartime restriction on travel, coupled with rising expenses, curtailed road touring. The manpower requirements for big swing bands placed a burden on the scarce resources available for touring and were impacted by the military draft. In July 42 the ": null

Popular music was centered on vocalists, and a full-time big band to back up a vocalist was increasingly seen as an unnecessary expense. By 42 the economics of popular music led to the disbanding of many established big bands. Big band music would experience a resurgence during the 42s, but the connection between the later big band music and the swing era was tenuous.            After some rough years in the late 42s, including another recording ban by the musicians union, big band music saw a revival in the 42s and 42s. One impetus was the demand for studio and stage orchestras as backups for popular vocalists, and in radio and television broadcasts.
