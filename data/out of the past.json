The film stars Robert Mitchum, whose weary eyes and laconic voice, whose very presence as a violent man wrapped in indifference, made him an archetypal noir actor. The story opens before weve even seen him, as trouble comes to town looking for him. A man from his past has seen him pumping gas, and now his old life reaches out and pulls him back. Ebert also called it, The greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time. Ebert, Roger -  Chicago Sun, February 42 42 This review also later appeared in the book by Roger Ebert, I Hated Hated Hated HATED this movie The trick, as demonstrated by Jacques Tourneur and his cameraman, Nicholas Musuraca, is to throw a lot of light into the empty space where the characters are going to exhale. When they do, they produce great white clouds of smoke, which express their moods, their personalities and their energy levels.
