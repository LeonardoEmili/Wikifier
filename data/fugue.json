A fugue begins with the  exposition  and is written according to certain predefined rules; in later portions the composer has more freedom, though a logical key structure is usually followed. Further entries of the subject will occur throughout the fugue, repeating the accompanying material at the same time.  The various entries may or may not be separated by episodes.

After the statement of the subject, a second voice enters and states the subject with the subject transposed to another key , which is known as the answer.   To make the music run smoothly, it may also have to be altered slightly. When the answer is an exact copy of the subject to the new key, with identical intervals to the first statement, it is classified as a real answer; if the intervals are altered to maintain the key it is a tonal answer.          A tonal answer is usually called for when the subject begins with a prominent dominant note, or where there is a prominent dominant note very close to the beginning of the subject.

The distinction is made between the use of free counterpoint and regular countersubjects accompanying the fugue subject/answer, because in order for a countersubject to be heard accompanying the subject in more than one instance, it must be capable of sounding correctly above or below the subject, and must be conceived, therefore, in invertible counterpoint.

        " music, invertible contrapuntal lines must be written according to certain rules because several intervallic combinations, while acceptable in one particular orientation, are no longer permissible when inverted. For example, when the note G sounds in one voice above the note C in lower voice, the interval of a fifth is formed, which is considered consonant and entirely acceptable. When this interval is inverted , it forms a fourth, considered a dissonance in tonal contrapuntal practice, and requires special treatment, or preparation and resolution, if it is to be used.  The countersubject, if sounding at the same time as the answer, is transposed to the pitch of the answer.  Each voice then responds with its own subject or answer, and further countersubjects or free counterpoint may be heard.     When a tonal answer is used, it is customary for the exposition to alternate subjects with answers , however, in some fugues this order is occasionally varied: e.g., see the SAAS arrangement of Fugue No. 1 in C Major, BWV 846, from ": null

It is uncommon for the subject to enter alone in a single voice in the middle-entries as in the exposition; rather, it is usually heard with at least one of the countersubjects and/or other free contrapuntal accompaniments.

One of the famous examples of such non-modulating fugue occurs in Buxtehudes Praeludium in C, BuxWV 137.     When there is no entrance of the subject and answer material, the composer can develop the subject by altering the subject. This is called an episode,  often by  inversion , although the term is sometimes used synonymously with middle-entry and may also describe the exposition of completely new subjects, as in a double fugue for example .

This limitation exists in consequence of sheer proportionality: the more voices in a fugue, the greater the number of possible permutations.

In Fugue for Tinhorns from the Broadway musical Guys and Dolls , written by Frank Loesser , the characters Nicely-Nicely, Benny, and Rusty sing simultaneously about hot tips they each have in an upcoming horse race .     A few examples also exist within progressive rock , such as the central movement of The Endless Enigma by Emerson, Lake & Palmer and On Reflection by Gentle Giant .           A widespread view of the fugue is that it is not a musical form but rather a technique of composition.     The Austrian musicologist Erwin Ratz argues that the formal organization of a fugue involves not only the arrangement of its theme and episodes, but also its harmonic structure. In particular, the exposition and coda tend to emphasize the tonic key , whereas the episodes usually explore more distant tonalities. Ratz stressed, however, that this is the core, underlying form of the fugue, from which individual fugues may deviate.     Thus it is to be noted that while certain related keys are more commonly explored in fugal development, the overall structure of a fugue does not limit its harmonic structure. For example, a fugue may not even explore the dominant, one of the most closely related keys to the tonic. Bachs Fugue in B major from book one of the Well Tempered Clavier explores the relative minor , the supertonic and the subdominant . This is unlike later forms such as the sonata, which clearly prescribes which keys are explored . Then, many modern fugues dispense with traditional tonal harmonic scaffolding altogether, and either use serial rules, or , use panchromatic, or even denser, harmonic spectra.       Fugue is the most complex of contrapuntal forms. In Ratzs words, fugal technique significantly burdens the shaping of musical ideas, and it was given only to the greatest geniuses, such as Bach and Beethoven, to breathe life into such an unwieldy form and make it the bearer of the highest thoughts.
