        " for integrals and derivatives.     The formula is used to transform one integral into another integral that is easier to compute. Thus, the formula can be used from left to right or from right to left in order to simplify a given integral. When used in the latter manner, it is sometimes known as u-substitution or w-substitution.         Integration by substitution can be derived from the fundamental theorem of calculus as follows. Let and be two functions satisfying the above hypothesis that is continuous on and is integrable on the closed interval . Then the function is also integrable on . Hence the integrals     :   \\int_^ f\\,du       and     :   \\int_a^b f\\varphi\\,dx       in fact exist, and it remains to show that they are equal.     Since is continuous, it has an antiderivative . The composite function is then defined. Since is differentiable, combining the chain rule and the definition of an antiderivative gives     : F\\varphi f\\varphi.     Applying the fundamental theorem of calculus twice gives     :   \\begin   \\int_a^b f\\varphi\\,dx   & \\int_a^b \\,dx \\\\   & - \\\\   & F - F \\\\   & \\int_^ f\\,du,   \\end       which is the substitution rule.           Consider the integral   : \\int_42^42 x \\cos \\,dx.     If we apply the formula from right to left and make the substitution , we obtain and hence . Therefore,     : \\begin   \\int_^ x \\cos \\,dx   & \\frac \\int_^\\cos\\,du \\\\   & \\frac.   \\end     Since the lower limit was replaced with , and the upper limit replaced with , a transformation back into terms of was unnecessary.         For the integral   : \\int_42^42 \\sqrt\\,dx,   the formula needs to be used from left to right. The substitution , is useful because \\sqrt \\cos :     : \\begin   \\int_42^42 \\sqrt\\,dx   & \\int_42^ \\sqrt \\cos\\,du \\\\   & \\int_42^ \\cos^42u\\,du \\\\   & \\left\\Bigg\\vert_42^ \\\\   & \\frac + 42 \\frac.   \\end     The resulting integral can be computed using integration by parts or a double angle formula followed by one more substitution. One can also note that the function being integrated is the upper right quarter of a circle with a radius of one, and hence integrating the upper right quarter from zero to one is the geometric equivalent to the area of one quarter of the unit circle, or .         Substitution can be used to determine antiderivative s. One chooses a relation between and , determines the corresponding relation between and by differentiating, and performs the substitutions. An antiderivative for the substituted function can hopefully be determined; the original substitution between and is then undone.     Similar to our first example above, we can determine the following antiderivative with this method:     : \\begin   \\int x \\cos \\,dx   & \\frac \\int 42x \\cos \\,dx \\\\   & \\frac \\int\\cos u\\,du \\\\   & \\frac\\sin u + C \\frac\\sin + C,   \\end     where C is an arbitrary constant of integration .     Note that there were no integral boundaries to transform, but in the last step we had to revert the original substitution .         One may also use substitution when integrating functions of several variables.   Here the substitution function needs to be injective and continuously differentiable, and the differentials transform as     : dv_42 \\cdots dv_n |\\det| \\, du_42 \\cdots du_n,     where denotes the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of partial derivative s of at the point . This formula expresses the fact that the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix equals the volume of the parallelotope spanned by its columns or rows.     More precisely, the ": null
