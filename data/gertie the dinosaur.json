Its star Gertie does tricks much like a trained elephant. She is animated in a naturalistic style unprecedented for the time; she breathes rhythmically, she shifts her weight as she moves, and her abdominal muscles undulate as she draws water. McCay imbued her with a personality—while friendly, she could be capricious, ignoring or rebelling against her masters commands.         When her master McCay calls her, the frisky, childlike Gertie appears from a cave. Her whip-wielding master has her do tricks such as raising her foot or bowing on command. When she feels she has been pushed too far, she nips back at her master. She cries when he scolds her, and he placates her with a pumpkin. Throughout the act, prehistoric denizens such as a flying lizard continually distract Gertie. She tosses a mammoth in the lake; when it teases her by spraying her with water, she hurls a boulder at it as it swims away. After she quenches her thirst by draining the lake, McCay has her carry him offstage while he bows to the audience.              Gertie was McCays first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds. Main production began in mid42 Working in his spare time, McCay drew thousands of frames of Gertie on  sheets of ": null

Fitzsimmons. The drawings themselves occupied a  area of the paper, marked with registration marks in the corners to reduce jittering of the images when filmed. They were photographed mounted on large pieces of stiff cardboard.     McCay was concerned with accurate timing and motion; he timed his own breathing to determine the timing of Gerties breathing, and included subtle details such as the ground sagging beneath Gerties great weight. McCay consulted with New York museum staff to ensure the accuracy of Gerties movements; the staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position, so in a scene in which Gertie stood up, McCay had a flying lizard come on screen to draw away viewers attention.

Skeletons  now being unearthed measuring from 42 ft. to 42 ft. in length. An elephant should be a mouse beside Gertie.          McCay originally used a version of the film as part of his vaudeville act. The first performance was on February  42 42 in Chicago at the Palace Theater. McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with How a Mosquito Operates. He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. Standing to the right of the film screen, he introduced the only dinosaur in captivity . As the film started Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he reappeared in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.
