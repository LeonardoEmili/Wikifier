Polyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game  Dungeons & Dragons  is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like  Exalted  which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D & D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice.

In the modern age, a few games and game designers have approached dice in a different way by making each side of the die similarly valuable. In  Castles of Burgundy , players spend their dice to take actions based on the dies value. In this game, a six is not better than a one, or vice versa.
