Simplicity of design and control—Machines are easily designed using standard cylinders and other components, and operate via simple on-off control.   Reliability—Pneumatic systems generally have long operating lives and require little maintenance. Because gas is compressible, equipment is less subject to shock damage. Gas absorbs excessive force, whereas fluid in hydraulics directly transfers force. Compressed gas can be stored, so machines still run for a while if electrical power is lost.   Safety—There is a very low chance of fire compared to hydraulic oil. New machines are usually overload safe to a certain limit.       Liquid does not absorb any of the supplied energy.
