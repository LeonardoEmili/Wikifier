Due to this simplicity, and just having suitable microchips at hand, the Bell 202 modulation became standard way to send the packet radio data over the radio as two distinct tones.

Other systems which involved small modification of the radio were developed by James Miller and operated at 9,600 bit/s.     1,200 bit/s AFSK node controllers on 2 meters are the most commonly found packet radio. For 1,200/2,400 bit/s UHF/VHF packet radio, amateurs use commonly available narrow band FM voice radios. For HF packet, 300 bit/s data is used over single sideband  modulation. For high speed packet , special radios or modified FM radios must be used.     Custom modems have been developed which allow throughput rates of 19.2 kbit/s, 56 kbit/s, and even 1.2  Mbit/s over amateur radio links on FCC permitted frequencies of 440  MHz and above. However, special radio equipment is needed to carry data at these speeds. The interface between the modem and the radio is at the intermediate frequency part of the radio as opposed to the audio section used for 1,200  bit/s operation. The adoption of these high-speed links has been limited.     In many commercial data radio applications, audio baseband modulation is not used. Data is transmitted by altering the transmitter output frequency between two distinct frequencies .          The 2.4  GHz Wi-Fi band partially overlaps an amateur radio band, so commercial Wi-Fi hardware can be adapted and used by licensed amateur radio operators at higher power levels, although restrictions on amateur radio limit the appeal of using packet radio to connect to the internet. US FCC regulations do not allow amateur radio communications to be encrypted or private, in addition to other content restrictions.
